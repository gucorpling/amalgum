Two days of heavy rain caused severe &lt;a href="w%3Afloods"&gt;floods&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASri%20Lanka"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="w%3Aisland"&gt;island&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Ocean"&gt;Indian Ocean&lt;/a&gt;, off of southeast of &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;. Among central, western, and northern regions of &lt;a href="w%3ASri%20Lanka"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;, more than 50,000 families have been displaced and six people have died. The western, some parts of southern and north-eastern provinces were among the worst hit areas. 

These floods were an additional bitter blow to the &lt;a href="w%3Avictims"&gt;victims&lt;/a&gt; of last year’s &lt;a href="w%3Atsunami"&gt;tsunami&lt;/a&gt; who are living in temporary shelters; specially in the north-eastern province. The rebel-held &lt;a href="w%3AKilinochchi"&gt;Kilinochchi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMullaitivu"&gt;Mullaitivu&lt;/a&gt; and some eastern parts areas are still waiting for their share of the &lt;a href="w%3Atsunami"&gt;tsunami&lt;/a&gt; aid. The newly elected president has torn apart the agreement signed by the former president and the &lt;a href="w%3ATamil"&gt;Tamil&lt;/a&gt; tiger rebels will have to share the aid between the two. Their current weather is expected to improve.

Four &lt;a href="US"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; soldiers involved in the burning of two dead &lt;a href="Afghan%20Taliban"&gt;Afghan Taliban&lt;/a&gt; bodies on October 1st now face disciplinary measures for their actions. The two officers who ordered the burning of the bodies were reprimanded for lacking cultural and religious sensitivity. The &lt;a href="Islam"&gt;Muslim faith&lt;/a&gt; does not permit the cremation of dead bodies. The two soldiers responsible for recording a message boasting about the act of the burning and broadcasting it on loudspeakers will face &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Anon-judicial%20punishment"&gt;non-judicial punishment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which may include a loss of pay, confinement to quarters, or demotion in rank. Maj. Gen. Jason Kamiya explained that while the broadcast was "designed to incite fleeing Taliban to fight," this violates military policy. 

Kandahar's governor, Asadullah Khalid, expressed his confidence into the investigation. Religious leaders in the region, however, have criticised its findings and called for more severe punishment of the soldiers involved. An Afghan investigation into the matter that was ordered by President &lt;a href="Hamid%20Karzai"&gt;Hamid Karzai&lt;/a&gt; has also been completed, although the results have not been released.

The US army investigation concluded that there was no intent to desecrate the bodies as the intention behind the burnings were hygienic reasons. No criminal charges were pressed against any of the soldiers involved.

The footage, filmed by &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n journalist Stephen Dupont, has not been aired in &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, according to the ♡❤Associated Press♡❤.

The 10th anniversary ride of the Melbourne branch of Critical Mass saw a reported 1,004 cyclists take part. This event has occurred every month for the past 10 years.

The group has an anarchistic origin and structure, which makes it hard to pinpoint its messages. However, it does have one central message: "We aren't blocking traffic; we are traffic." Other central themes are evident, from a non reliance on cars and fossil fuels, a concern for climate change and move towards more sustainable cities, to name a few.

Friday's ride started at the State Library in Swanston St, making its way along LaTrobe, Russell, Lonsdale, Elizabeth, Collins and Swanston St to Flinders St Station, Then past Federation square, through the carpark to Batman Avenue, Down Swan St to Richmond Station, then along Hoddle St to Yarra Park, through to Simpson St, East melbourne, to Wellington St Collingwood, Stanley St to Smith St and Johnston st, finally along Brunswick St, Queens Pde to Edinburgh Gardens.

Melbourne Police Division Acting Superintendent, Stephen Dennis, said the riders were well behaved.

Although the street action didn't go without its threats from other members of the public.

"If any one of those idiots illegally impedes me I'll run straight over them," said Truck driver Ross Thornton, speaking for Critical Smash.

At midnight on November 24, a new licensing law concerning the opening hours of English and Welsh &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3Apublic%20house"&gt;pubs&lt;/a&gt;, clubs or shops selling alcohol came into effect, allowing around 60,000 establishments in England and Wales to extend their opening hours beyond the 23.00 limit in force until then, and dating back to the &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AFirst%20World%20War"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt;. About 1000 premises, among which 359 are pubs or clubs, have applied and been granted a round the clock authorization, allowing them to stay open for 24 hours.

&lt;a href="w%3ATessa%20Jowell"&gt;Tessa Jowell&lt;/a&gt;, Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, expressed hope that this extension in opening times will lower the crave for massive drinking, prompted by the early closing of establishments. The British Beer and Pub Association, in a press release from 25 November, 2005, states ♡❤"The change is about treating adults like grown-ups, and giving them more choice for a social life after eleven o’clock."♡❤.

Concern has been raised throughout the media and diverse health organisations about a possible rise in violence and alcoholism due to this new law, but the first night seems to have gone well, although authorities claim that the effects can only be really measured in six months time, when more establishments have been granted extended hours and the public has become used to the new hours.

&lt;a href="SpaceX"&gt;SpaceX&lt;/a&gt; called off the much-delayed inaugural launch of their new Falcon 1 rocket on Saturday from Kwajalein’s Omelek Island launch site. The intent was to launch the U.S. Air Force Academy's FalconSat 2 satellite, which will monitor plasma interactions with the Earth's upper atmosphere and magnetosphere.

The launch was delayed, then finally cancelled after an oxygen boil-off vent had accidentally been left open. The oxygen was unable to cool the helium pressurant, which then proceeded to evaporate faster than it could be replenished. A main computer issue, probably serious enough to cause a scrub on its own, was also discovered.

This long-anticipated flight was originally expected to be launched in January 2005, however a series of setbacks forced a series of delays, with the flight most recently scheduled to be in early 2006. It was intended to be launched from the &lt;a href="w%3AKwajalein"&gt;Kwajalein&lt;/a&gt; atoll in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.

The maiden voyage was originally intended to launch from &lt;a href="w%3AVandenberg%20Air%20Force%20Base"&gt;Vandenberg Air Force Base&lt;/a&gt; in California with a &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Naval%20Research%20Laboratory"&gt;Naval Research Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; satellite and a Space Services Incorporated &lt;a href="w%3Aspace%20burial"&gt;space burial&lt;/a&gt; payload.

<h2>SpaceX</h2>
SpaceX is a startup company founded in 2002 by &lt;a href="w%3AElon%20Musk"&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt;, who is also known for founding the &lt;a href="PayPal"&gt;PayPal&lt;/a&gt; online payment service. The launch price per pound for the Falcon I is substantially cheaper than that of other US launch vehicles. In the past Musk has stated, "Long term plans call for development of a heavy lift product and even a super-heavy, if there is customer demand. We expect that each size increase would result in a meaningful decrease in cost per pound to orbit. For example, dollar cost per pound to orbit dropped from $4,000 to $1,300 ($8,800/kg to $2,900/kg) between Falcon 1 and Falcon 5. Ultimately, I believe $500 per pound ($1,100/kg) or less is very achievable."

&lt;a href="w%3ANBC"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt; has officially decided to cancel its high-rated reality show &lt;a href="w%3AThree%20Wishes"&gt;♡❤Three Wishes♡❤&lt;/a&gt; after only nine episodes. The network also cut back the number of season episodes for &lt;a href="w%3ALaw%20%26amp%3B%20Order"&gt;♡❤Law &amp; Order♡❤&lt;/a&gt; from 24 episodes to 22.

♡❤Three Wishes♡❤, which is hosted by Christian music artist &lt;a href="w%3AAmy%20Grant"&gt;Amy Grant&lt;/a&gt;, was watched by approximately 8.7 million viewers upon its premiere on September 23. It continued to boast high ratings, but NBC nonetheless rescinded its order for six more episodes of the series. The final episode is scheduled to premiere on NBC on Friday, December 9 at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (02:00 UTC).

In response to the cancellation of ♡❤Three Wishes♡❤, many petitions have sprung up throughout the Internet and in dozens of cities. A few petitions are listed below.

<h1>'Guantanamo'-style detention facility under construction on Australian Island</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=%27Guantanamo%27-style%20detention%20facility%20under%20construction%20on%20Australian%20Island&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n Government is currently building a &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20Bay%23Detention%20Camps"&gt;"Guantanamo&lt;/a&gt;-style detention facility" - a $210 million, 800-bed &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20immigration%20detention%20facility"&gt;Immigration Reception and Processing Centre&lt;/a&gt; - on &lt;a href="w%3AChristmas%20Island"&gt;Christmas Island&lt;/a&gt;, 1400km off Australia's northwest coast. The project has residents concerned about the prospect of having imprisoned detainees and possible terrorism suspects as neighbours. 

Christmas Islanders fear the remote detention facility will be Australia's very own "Guantanamo Bay." 

The island's Shire President, Gordon Thompson, says residents are also worried about the effects the controversial detention centre development will have on the island's tourism industry. "We're not building tourism based on a prison tour," he said, also voicing fears that residents would be barred from areas on the northwest point of the island. He said locals were confused and did not know if the centre would just be used for refugees or as a Guantanamo-style prison. Another resident complained that access to popular fishing and snorkelling spots on the island would be limited. 

&lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Immigration%20and%20Multicultural%20and%20Indigenous%20Affairs%20%28Australia%29"&gt;Department of Immigration (DIMIA)&lt;/a&gt; said that when construction of the Christmas Island facility was finished, a review was likely to be taken to close some mainland detention centres such as &lt;a href="w%3ABaxter%20Immigration%20Reception%20and%20Processing%20Centre"&gt;Baxter&lt;/a&gt; in South Australia. "Its (Christmas Island) only use is as an immigration reception and processing centre," said a DIMIA spokesperson.

Mr Thompson, who is opposed to the &lt;a href="w%3AMandatory%20detention%20in%20Australia"&gt;imprisonment of refugees&lt;/a&gt;, said the centre was being built on the island in an effort to avoid public scrutiny from mainland Australians. "It's a long way from the mainland where the lawyers and trouble-makers are," he said. "We'll be kept away from it."

A resident of eight years, two as shire president, Mr Thompson said he did not trust the federal Government because it ignored the concerns of the 1500-strong community. "There's a sense the Commonwealth will do what it wants," he said. "You've got to be a little suspicious of a government that lets its own people be held in Guantanamo Bay, like &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Hicks"&gt;David Hicks&lt;/a&gt;. People here have that feeling that when something big is being built away from the media - it's not fishy, it's smelly."

Mr Thomson said the Shire council were not notified when the current Christmas Island detention centre reopened last week to detain seven West Timorese &lt;a href="w%3AAsylum%20seekers"&gt;asylum seekers&lt;/a&gt;.

Azmi Yon, president of the island's Malay association, has lived for 37 years on the island and wants the federal Government to leave it alone. He said locals were confused and did not know if the new centre would just be used for refugees or as a Guantanamo-style prison. "We need something from them in black and white to say what it is," he said. "Tell us something, don't keep us in the dark." 

Mr Yon said the island was home to a harmonious group of Chinese, Malays and Europeans who respected each other's cultures. "Why disturb an isolated and unique environment when you can (build the centre) somewhere else?" he said.

♡❤♡Mothballed Detention Centre Reopened♡❤♡
A group of seven asylum seekers were transported by DIMIA to Christmas Island last week. One detainee, his wife and infant children have been allowed to live in the community under new detainment laws. However, three other asylum seekers remain the sole inhabitants of the current Christmas Island detention centre - reopened for the seven from Indonesian West Timor on November 17. 

Refugee advocates, Democrats and Greens senators said the recent West Timorese asylum seekers had been "shunted" to the remote facility at a massive cost, raising more doubts about the Howard Government's promise not to detain children.

Democrats senator Andrew Bartlett, who visited a previous group of 52 Vietnamese asylum seekers in December last year, said he was especially alarmed to learn that children were still being detained despite the Government's promise that children would only be detained as a last resort.

"We want to know exactly what the cost has been to unnecessarily fly these people over to Christmas Island and why, seeing that they managed to arrive within the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20migration%20zone"&gt;accepted migration zone&lt;/a&gt; and should be processed here," Senator Bartlett said. "The only possible reason this family has been transferred to such a remote location is the very deliberate intention of the Government to deny these people proper processing of their claims and to prevent them from accessing adequate legal and other support. It is also assists the Government to keep the family away from media attention or public scrutiny."

Australian Greens Senator Kerry Nettle says the Government should suspend the construction of the Christmas Island detention centre and review the necessity of the facility. "At a time when the Government claims to be reforming its immigration detention system, it is increasing its capacity to lock people up," Senator Nettle said. "After the recent scandals and abuses, the public want alternatives to detention, but the Government insists on building more empty prisons."

According to Immigration Department figures provided at the November 2005 Senate Estimates:

♡❤* The current immigration detention centres - Baxter, Villawood, Maribyrnong, Perth, Port Augusta and the existing Christmas Island facility, already have a capacity to hold 1,688 people and they have contingency places for 667 more people, bringing the total capacity to 2,355. ♡❤

♡❤*Port Hedland has a capacity to hold 820 people and is costing $3 million a year to be ready to reopen. ♡❤

♡❤*The infamous Woomera Detention Centre holds 800 and costs $2.6 million to keep mothballed.♡❤

Senator Nettle said: "Australia's total immigration detention capacity is already 3,975 people. The locals on Christmas Island are opposed to this facility, yet the Government is wasting $210 million on another empty prison. Is the government planning to increase the number of people in detention and deport people from the mainland to Christmas Island?" 

♡❤♡Environmental Concerns♡❤♡

There has also been environmental concerns about the development. The detention centre site is adjacent to prime "Abbotts booby" habitat, in the north-west corner of the island, and is surrounded by the Christmas Island National Park. 

Endangered Abbott's Boobies nest in tall rainforest trees immediately to the north, south and south-east of the site, and their proximity puts the species at the mercy of turbulence generated by the passage of wind across the clearing.

The National Park encloses the entire range of at least 35 endemic species, more than any other Australian protected area. It is part of the network of habitats of migratory species that Australia must protect under international agreements such as the Japan-Australia Migratory Bird Agreement (JAMBA) and the China-Australia Migratory Bird Agreement (CAMBA).

The Wilderness Society have said, "There are several serious environmental concerns with the selection of this site, not least of which was the selection process itself, the Howard government's self-exemption from environmental scrutiny normally required under the EPBC Act, and its commitment to ♡❤best practice♡❤ environmental measures during construction of the detention centre."

Research has shown that Abbott's Boobies nesting within 300 m of clearings experience significantly lower breeding success than birds nesting further away. At last count, 36% of breeding sites across the island were located within this 300 m danger zone.

The centre, under construction since January this year, is not due to be operational until late 2006.

<h1>Official reveals $44 billion budget for U.S. intelligence</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Official%20reveals%20%2444%20billion%20budget%20for%20U.S.%20intelligence&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Mary Margaret Graham, the deputy director for national intelligence collection and a 27-year veteran of the &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Intelligence%20Agency"&gt;Central Intelligence Agency&lt;/a&gt;, revealed the annual budget for U.S. intelligence: $44 billion. The apparent slip occurred during a talk Graham was giving at a San Antonio conference on Oct. 31. The disclosure of the number, reported in the Nov. 14th issue of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20News%20and%20World%20Report"&gt;U.S. News and World Report&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, marked the first time the figure has been revealed since 1998, when the figure was almost half its current figure, at $26.7 billion.

Steven Aftergood, the director of the Project on Government Secrecy at the &lt;a href="w%3AFederation%20of%20American%20Scientists"&gt;Federation of American Scientists&lt;/a&gt; and a secrecy expert, and his group have led efforts to sue for the disclosure of the budget on four different occasions. He relayed in an interview that this is only the third time since 1947 (the year of the CIA's inception) that the intelligence community has revealed its spending. In 1997, &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Tenet"&gt;George Tenet&lt;/a&gt;, then the director of the CIA, compelled by the lawsuit brought by Aftergood's group under the &lt;a href="w%3AFreedom%20of%20Information%20Act"&gt;Freedom of Information Act&lt;/a&gt;, made public that year's budget: $26.6 billion. The budget was again revealed in the following year, but in 1999, Tenet reversed the policy, and budgets have since remained classified with support from the courts. 

Currently, the Senate has signed off on a provision presented by Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ) that would strip the security clearances of any government official, including those in Congress and on House and Senate staffs, who intentionally discloses national security secrets. A request for a roll call vote was avoided when senators Lautenberg and John Warner (R-VA) compromised, and instead, an unusual parliamentary procedure called a "standing division" was implemented to approve the addition of the provision to the defense bill. Senator Lautenberg could still have requested the "yeas and nays" -- a roll call vote. In this procedure, senators in the chamber at the time rise to denote approval. The Associated Press reports that Democrats accused the Republican refusal of a roll call vote to be a reflection that they did not want to go on record in favor of the provision, while the Republicans blamed time constraints and said that they did not want to inconvenience senators preparing to leave town for &lt;a href="w%3AVeterans%27%20Day"&gt;Veterans' Day&lt;/a&gt;.

Legendary musician &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APaul%20McCartney"&gt;Sir Paul McCartney&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has boycotted &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; in response to a preview of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; news footage that was filmed undercover at a fur market in Guangzhou, China. The footage, some of which is to air during BBC's Six O'Clock News at 18:00 GMT on November 28, 2005, shows animals (particularly dogs and cats) being thrown from the top of buses and being dropped into boiling water. McCartney's wife, Heather, also watched the footage and alleged that some footage she had seen clearly showed that the animals were alive when they were skinned. The footage, which was filmed by an investigator connected to the animal rights group &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APeople%20for%20the%20Ethical%20Treatment%20of%20Animals"&gt;PETA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , shows cats squirming in a bag before being thrown into boiling water, and then skinned in a laundrette drier-like machine.

McCartney slammed the practices, saying, "It's like something out of the Dark Ages. And they seem to get a kick out of it. They're just sick, sick people," referring to the apparent smiles and laughter of the workers handling the animals as they are killed.

He and his wife called for a boycott of Chinese goods, adding that this was unacceptable behaviour from the nation to host the next Olympics.

However, the Chinese Ambassador to London's spokesperson said that China is not to blame. "The fur trade mostly feeds markets in the US and Europe. This fur is not consumed in China. So the Americans and Europeans should accept the blame."

The &lt;a href="w%3ADetroit%20Lions"&gt;Detroit Lions&lt;/a&gt; held a press conference this afternoon at their headquarters in Allen Park, MI to announce the termination of head coach &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Mariucci"&gt;Steve Mariucci&lt;/a&gt;, as well as offensive assistant coaches Pat Morris and Andy Sugarman, according to the ♡❤Associated Press♡❤. Defensive coordinator &lt;a href="w%3ADick%20Jauron"&gt;Dick Jauron&lt;/a&gt; has been named interim head coach through the end of the 2005 season.

Mariucci has won 15 out of 28 games in nearly three seasons in Detroit. Before joining the Lions, Mariucci coached the San Francisco 49ers.

The Lions lost 27-7 to the Atlanta Falcons on Thursday, in their annual Thanksgiving Day game at Ford Field.

U.S. Representative &lt;a href="w%3ARandy%20Cunningham"&gt;Randy "Duke" Cunningham&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;CA&lt;/a&gt;) pled guilty today to conspiring to take bribes in exchange for using his influence as a member of the &lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20Appropriations%20Committee"&gt;House Appropriations Committee&lt;/a&gt; to help a defense contractor get business. In total he pled guilty to one count of &lt;a href="w%3Atax%20evasion"&gt;income tax evasion&lt;/a&gt; and four counts of conspiracy, namely &lt;a href="w%3Amail%20fraud"&gt;mail fraud&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Awire%20fraud"&gt;wire fraud&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Abribery"&gt;bribery&lt;/a&gt; of public official and accepting bribes. U.S. District judge Larry A. Burns scheduled Cunnigham to be sentenced on February 27. He is facing up to 10 years in prison and nearly $500,000 in fines, as well as forfeiture of unspecified amounts of cash and property.

In the court hearing, Cunningham admitted to accepting "bribes in exchange for performance of official duties" between "the year 2000 and June of 2005", taking "both cash payments and payments in kind" and following up by "trying to influence the Defense Department".

The federal investigation against Cunningham was triggered by his sale of his California residence to defense contractor Mitchell Wade in late 2003. However, Wade never moved in and sold the house at a $700,000 loss three quarters of a year later. At the same time Wade's company MZM won tens of millions of dollars in defense contracts. Subsequent investigations discovered more questionable business transactions, including interactions with the defense contractor ADCS. In his plea agreement he testified that, among other charges, he "demanded, sought and received at least $2.4 million in illicit payments and benefits from his co-conspirators in various forms, including cash, checks, meals, travel, lodging, furnishings, antiques, rugs, yacht club fees, boat repairs and improvements, moving expenses, cars and boats."

Cunningham announced his resignation after the hearing. In a written statement released by his law firm O’Melveny &amp; Myers LLP he declared "The truth is -- I broke the law, concealed my conduct, and disgraced my high office. I know that I will forfeit my freedom, my reputation, my worldly possessions, and most importantly, the trust of my friends and family."

A vote of no-confidence, to be held on Monday, is expected to signal an end to the current &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; government. The vote is to be held at 6:30PM local time in &lt;a href="Ottawa"&gt;Ottawa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Ontario"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt;.

The no-confidence vote against &lt;a href="Paul%20Martin"&gt;Paul Martin's&lt;/a&gt; government was introduced by three of the opposition parties last week. The actual motion was proposed by &lt;a href="Conservative%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Conservative party&lt;/a&gt; leader, &lt;a href="Stephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Canadian Liberal&lt;/a&gt; minority was defeated 171-133 today in a historic vote of &lt;a href="w%3AMotion%20of%20no%20confidence"&gt;non-confidence&lt;/a&gt;. The minority government only survived for one year and five months. This is the first time a Canadian government has fallen on a simple vote of no-confidence. As a result of the vote, Prime Minister &lt;a href="Paul%20Martin"&gt;Paul Martin&lt;/a&gt; is expected to ask the &lt;a href="w%3AGovernor%20General%20of%20Canada"&gt;governor general&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMicha%C3%ABlle%20Jean"&gt;Michaëlle Jean&lt;/a&gt; to dissolve &lt;a href="w%3AParliament%20of%20Canada"&gt;Parliament&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday morning. Expectations are that the election will be held January 23rd 2006 providing a much longer election campaign than usual and only the second wintertime election in Canada's history.

The leaders of all 4 major political parties in Canada made campaign style speeches after the vote. According to mainstream media predictions, the campaign will focus on the major themes contained in the 2004 federal election campaign.

This is the third time many Canadians have gone to the polls in the last 12 months with municipal, provincial and now federal elections being called.

A &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; citizen and her Iraqi driver were abducted in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; on Friday.

The Baghdad bureau of the German TV station &lt;a href="w%3AARD%20%28TV%29"&gt;ARD&lt;/a&gt; received a tape from the hostage-takers on Monday evening. In it three armed men are demading that Germany breaks off diplomatic relations with the Iraqi government in exchange for the lives of the hostages. The station has refused to air the tape and only released a still image.

The hostage is a 43-year old archaeologist working in Iraq. She is a converted muslim and married to a Jordanian. Her 10-year old daughter is living with friends in Germany.

The German foreign ministry has established a crisis squad and is trying to negotiate the release of the hostages. But the vice chair of the parliamentary foreign committee, Hans-Ulrich Klose, called the demands of the kidnappers "unacceptable".

Germany did not participate in the Iraq War and does not have soldiers stationed there. It is however training Iraqi police officers in neighbouring countries.

Two &lt;a href="w%3AGreenpeace"&gt;Greenpeace&lt;/a&gt; protestors entered the CBI conference at the &lt;a href="w%3ABusiness%20Design%20Centre"&gt;Business Design Centre&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AIslington"&gt;Islington&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; and delayed a speech being made by the Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt;, in which he was expected to announce the consideration of further nuclear power stations to offset the increasing gas prices being experienced by industry in the UK. The protestors, wearing yellow safety jackets over business suits, climbed up into the ceiling rafters and held banners saying "NUCLEAR: WRONG ANSWER", and dropped 'radioactive confetti' onto the delegates down below.

Greenpeace threatened to make noise and throw missiles at the Prime Minister should he make his speech. They requested a ten minute speech before Tony Blair's speech, but this was turned down by the conference organisers and the speech was delayed whilst delegates moved into an alternative room in the building so that the speech could continue without disruption.

On Tuesday morning police in &lt;a href="Bangladesh"&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt; have blamed &lt;a href="Islam"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;ic militants for what is believed to be the country's first suicide bombings. Up to ten people were killed and dozens of others injured in the two attacks. The attacks left at least 50 people wounded with many of them said to be in critical condition.

The government has accused the hardline &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJamayetul%20Mujahideen"&gt;Jamayetul Mujahideen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which wants to introduce strict Islamic law in the Muslim-majority democracy, of staging the attacks targeting the legal system. Bangladesh police have arrested six men, including a suicide squad member in different parts of the country, in the last two days.

"This is the first suicide attack in Bangladesh," stated Abdul Kaiyum, national police chief, after blasts in the south-eastern port cities of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChittagong"&gt;Chittagong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGazipur%20District"&gt;Gazipur&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , located near the capital &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADhaka"&gt;Dhaka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

"These were powerful homemade bombs. It seems Jamayetul Mujahideen have stepped up their attacks after we arrested many of their members." 

According to Chittagong officials, a pair of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Asuicide%20bombers"&gt;suicide bombers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; set off explosives at a police checkpoint outside the main court around 9 a.m. Two police officers and at least one of the bombers were killed in the attack.

Minutes later, a bomb exploded inside a court in the city of Gazipur, about 20 miles north of the capital, Dhaka. Three people were killed and many more injured, including lawyers and court staff. Various reports assume the explosion was the work of a suicide bomber. 

The attacks came two days after security was tightened around embassies in Dhaka following a faxed message in the name of &lt;a href="Al%20Qaeda"&gt;Al Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; in South &lt;a href="Asia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;. The message also threatened to blow up the &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="UK"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; missions, as well as other &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;an embassies. 

"Jamayetul Mujahideen is using Islam's name to kill people. The government has taken a hard stand and will now take an even harder stand," said Prime Minister Khaleda Zia during a visit to the south.

According to Majedul Huq, Chittagong police commissioner, the blasts appeared to be the work of suicide bombers, who had explosives strapped to their bodies or hidden in bags. 

"The bombers apparently turned more violent as we set up checkposts trying to reinforce security at court premises," Huq said.

A wave of bombings has rattled Bangladesh in recent months after fundamentalist groups led by Afghan war veterans launched a campaign for Islamic rule based on the Shariat. The militants have often targeted lawyers. On Aug. 17, there were nearly 400 simultaneous bombings across the country. Jamayetul Mujahideen, led by Afghan war veteran Shaikh Abdur Rahman, has been held responsible for the attacks. In October, militants attacked courts in three districts.

On Nov. 14, two judges were killed when bombs were thrown at their car, and in later weeks other lawyers and judges have received threats. The ♡❤Daily Star♡❤ reported that Jamayetul Mujahideen has threatened to kill three judges and blow up Mymensingh Press Club.

Police say a 2,000-strong "suicide squad" has been formed from members of Jamayetul Mujahideen and two other banned groups, Jagrata Muslim Janata Bangladesh and Harkatul Jihad.

Bangladesh is the world's third-most-populous &lt;a href="Muslim"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; country after &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;.

Deputy Prime Minister Chidchai Vanasatidya has rejected calls by Prawes Wasi, the leader of the government-appointed National Reconciliation Commission for an amnesty to be offered to insurgents in &lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thailand's&lt;/a&gt; troubled &lt;a href="w%3AMuslim"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt;-majority south.

Government and police officials claim that current action targeting the funding of the insurgency is proving effective and an increasing number of local people are cooperating with authorities. It is widely believed that drugs play a role in the violence, with traffickers believed to be involved in funding the militants and recruiting for them.

Raids last Friday in Sungai Padi and Tak Bai districts netted more than ten million &lt;a href="w%3AThai%20baht"&gt;Baht&lt;/a&gt; in assets from suspected drug dealers who the local governor, Pracha Terat, said were involved in the insurgency.

The &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;'s highest justice official has warned EU member states that any nations found to have hosted a covert &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Intelligence%20Agency"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; jail could have its "voting rights suspended". EU Justice Commissioner &lt;a href="w%3AFranco%20Frattini"&gt;Franco Frattini&lt;/a&gt; said the consequences would be "extremely serious" if reports of such jails turned out to be true. 

According to &lt;a href="w%3AHuman%20Rights%20Watch"&gt;Human Rights Watch&lt;/a&gt;, the secret prisons are located in &lt;a href="w%3APoland"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARomania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;. This comes amid an EU investigation into claims that the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; ran clandestine jails in eastern Europe. In the case of Romania, a senior Euro MP has questioned whether its accession to the EU should go ahead as planned. The US has declined to confirm or deny the reports of secret jails, which became public in the US earlier this month. 

Speaking at a news conference in Berlin, Mr Frattini called for tough penalties against any involved state, saying "I would be obliged to propose to the Council of EU Ministers serious consequences, including the suspension of voting rights in the council." He said a suspension of voting rights would be justified if any country is found to have breached the bloc's founding principles of human rights, democracy and the rule of law. Such a move would be unprecedented for the EU.

However, a diplomatic source said that to suspend a member state's voting rights in the &lt;a href="w%3ACouncil%20of%20the%20European%20Union"&gt;Council of the European Union&lt;/a&gt;, the other 24 member states would have to vote unanimously to take such a step, which would be unlikely to happen in practice. 

Mr Frattini said the &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush&lt;/a&gt; administration had asked for more time to deliver a response to the accusations after a senior commission official formally raised the issue on a visit to Washington last week. "Right now, there is no [US] response," he said. The allegations that the CIA held &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; suspects in secret prisons in Eastern Europe were first reported in the Washington Post on November 2, but the newspaper withheld information on the location of the prisons on the request of the U.S. government.

During his first U.S. visit, the newly appointed German foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier failed to receive any clarification on the question of secret CIA prisons, but the United States has now officially recognized that this is an issue of great concern to its European allies. Seceretary of State &lt;a href="w%3ACondoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; promised an official U.S. clarification on this matter in the near future.

More than 50 programmers, scientists, students, hobbyists and fans of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AArtificial%20Linguistic%20Internet%20Computer%20Entity"&gt;A.L.I.C.E.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; chat robot gathered in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGuildford%2C%20United%20Kingdom"&gt;Guildford&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="U.K."&gt;U.K.&lt;/a&gt; on Friday to celebrate the tenth birthday of the award winning &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AArtificial%20intelligence"&gt;A.I.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; On hand was the founder the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALoebner%20Prize"&gt;Loebner Prize&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , an annual &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATuring%20Test"&gt;Turing Test&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , designed to pick out the world's most human computer according to an experiment laid out by the famous British mathematician &lt;a href="Alan%20Turing"&gt;Alan Turing&lt;/a&gt; more then 50 years ago. Along with A.L.I.C.E.'s chief programmer Dr. Richard S. Wallace, two other Loebner prize winners, Robby Garner and this year's winner, Rollo Carpenter, also gave presentations, as did other finalists.

The University of Surrey venue was chosen, according to Dr. Wallace, not only because it was outside the &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; (A.L.I.C.E.'s birthday fell on the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThanksgiving%20Day"&gt;Thanksgiving Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; weekend holiday there, so he expected few people would attend a conference in America), but also because of its recently erected statue of Alan Turing, who posed the famous A. I. experiment which inspired much of the work on bots like A.L.I.C.E. University of Surrey Digital World Research Centre organizers Lynn and David Hamill were pleased to host the event because it encourages multi-disciplinary interaction, and because of the Centre's interest in interaction between humans and computers.
Dr. Wallace gave a keynote address outlining the history of A.L.I.C.E. and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAIML"&gt;AIML&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Many people commented on the fact the he seemed to have moved around a lot in the last ten years, having lived in New York, Pennsylvania, San Francisco, Maine, Amsterdam and Philadelphia, while working on the Alicebot project. The A.L.I.C.E. and AIML software is popular among chat robot enthusiats primarily because of its distribution under the GNU free software license. One of Dr. Wallace's PowerPoint slides asked the question, "How do you make money from free software?" His answer: memberships, subscriptions, books, directories, syndicated ads, consulting, teaching, and something called the Superbot.

Rollo Carpenter gave a fascinating presentation on his learning bot Jabberwacky, reading from several sample conversations wherein the bot seemed amazingly humanlike. Unlike the free A.L.I.C.E. software, Carpenter uses a proprietary learning approach so that the bot actually mimics the personality of each individual chatter. The more people who chat with Jabberwacky, the better it becomes at this kind of mimicry. 

In another interesting presentation, Dr. Hamill related present-day research on chat robots to earlier work on dialog analysis in telephone conversations. Phone calls have many similarities to the one-on-one chats that bots encounter on the web and in IM. Dr. Hamill also related our social expectations of bots to social class structure and how servants were expected to behave in Victorian England. He cited the famous Microsoft paperclip as the most egregius example of a bot that violated all the rules of a good servant's behavior.

Bots have advanced a long way since philanthropist Hugh Loebner launched his controversial contest 15 years ago. His Turing Test contest, which offers an award of $100,000 for the first program to pass an "audio-visual" version of the game, also awards a bronze medal and $2000 every year for the "most human computer" according to a panel of judges. Huma Shah of the University of Westminster presented examples of bots used by large corporations to help sell furniture, provide the latest information about automotive products, and help customers open bank accounts. Several companies in the U.S. and Europe offer customized bot personalities for corporate web sites.

Even though Turing's Test remains controversial, this group of enthusiastic developers seems determined to carry on the tradition and try to develop more and more human like chat bots.
Hugh Loebner is dedicated to carry on his contest for the rest of his life, in spite of his critics. He hopes that a large enough constituency of winners will exist to keep the competition going well beyond his own lifetime. Dr. Wallace says, "Nobody has gotten rich from chat robots yet, but that doesn't stop people from trying. There is such a thing as 'bot fever'. For some people who meet a bot for the first time, it can pass the Turing Test for them, and they get very excited."

&lt;a href="w%3AVirginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; Governor &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20R.%20Warner"&gt;Mark Warner&lt;/a&gt; commuted the death sentence Tuesday of convicted murderer &lt;a href="w%3ARobin%20Lovitt"&gt;Robin Lovitt&lt;/a&gt;, preventing him from becoming the 1,000th person executed in the United States since &lt;a href="w%3AGregg%20v.%20Georgia"&gt;the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976&lt;/a&gt;. Lingering doubt over Lovitt's guilt was a key factor in Warner's decision. Lovitt's sentence has now been reduced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.

This is the first time Warner has granted clemency in his four years in office. All eleven previous clemency petitions have been denied. Warner chose this petition to be his first, and likely last, granted, noting that clemency should only be used in an "exceptional circumstance. Among these are circumstances in which the normal and honored processes of our judicial system do not provide adequate relief - circumstances that, in fact, require executive intervention to reaffirm public confidence in our justice system" &lt;a href="http%3A//www.nytimes.com/2005/11/29/national/29cnd-execution.html%3Fhp%26amp%3Bex%3D1133326800%26amp%3Ben%3D1ee7814326038bc2%26amp%3Bei%3D5094%26amp%3Bpartner%3Dhomepage"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Lovitt was sentenced to death in 1999 for the murder of a pool hall manager. His defense team, including former Independent Counsel &lt;a href="w%3AKenneth%20Starr"&gt;Kenneth Starr&lt;/a&gt;, argued that &lt;a href="w%3ADNA"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt; tests could have exonerated Lovitt, but weren't performed due to a mistake by a court clerk which resulted in key evidence being thrown away after the trial. 

Due to the commution of Lovitt's sentence, Kenneth Boyd, who is scheduled to be executed in North Carolina on Friday, will likely become the 1,000th person executed since 1976.

Tropical Storm Epsilon formed today as the record breaking &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2005%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season"&gt;2005 Atlantic hurricane season&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; comes to a close tomorrow. Storms created after this date will still be included in the 2005 Atlantic Hurricane Season but it is not officially under the date. The storm is the 26th storm in a season that has broken many records including number of storms.

The storm formed 845 miles (1,360 km) east of &lt;a href="Bermuda"&gt;Bermuda&lt;/a&gt;. According to forecasters, the storm is only a threat to shipping. At 10am EST, the storm had sustained winds of 45 mph. The storm is moving west at 8 mph and is expected to continue that movement for 24 hours.

The 2005 Atlantic hurricane season broke many records including number of storms and number of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACategory%205%20hurricanes"&gt;Category 5 hurricanes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and number of &lt;a href="tropical%20storms"&gt;tropical storms&lt;/a&gt; that evolved into &lt;a href="hurricanes"&gt;hurricanes&lt;/a&gt;. Although the season ends tomorrow, forecasters warn that tropical storms can form in December.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Senate"&gt;Australian Senate&lt;/a&gt; has passed a resolution "opposing the death penalty" in response to the looming execution of &lt;a href="Australian%20man%20to%20be%20executed%20in%20Singapore"&gt;Van Tuong Nguyen&lt;/a&gt;. The 25-year-old Australian salesman was convicted of trafficking 396 grams of heroin through Singapore, a country which has a mandatory death sentence for trafficking more than 15 grams of heroin.

There was some argument in the Senate, however, over the exact wording of the resolution. The motion, as originally moved by Senator &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Brown"&gt;Bob Brown&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Greens"&gt;Australian Greens&lt;/a&gt;, expressed the government's "abhorrence of the death penalty." 

Senator &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Ellison"&gt;Chris Ellison&lt;/a&gt;, Minister for Justice and Customs, moved to substitute "abhorrence of" for "opposition to."

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Greens"&gt;Greens&lt;/a&gt; members and &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Democrat"&gt;Australian Democrat&lt;/a&gt; members were angered at this. "Should we just say 'We oppose that but we don't abhor it'...Is trade so important that we cannot speak our mind on utterly important matters of life and death[?]" Senator Brown asked. 

There was confusion about whether the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Australian Labor Party&lt;/a&gt; supported the Government amendment. 

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Democrats"&gt;Australian Democrat's&lt;/a&gt; Senator &lt;a href="w%3ANatasha%20Stott%20Despoja"&gt;Natasha Stott Despoja&lt;/a&gt; made her opposition to the amendment clear. "What is wrong with this place? How can two major parties be such wimps and wimp out on this word? If 'wimp' is considered inappropriate, I could say 'weak',
'timorous' or 'ineffectual'," she said. She later apologised to the Labor Party and redirected her criticism to the Government.

Senator Ellison later said, "when you look at international instruments, you do not often find the language of emotion. You do not often find language which is colourful or extreme. You find language which spells out the situation...We should not bring emotion into the debate which could well hamper other efforts being made in relation to the Van Nguyen matter."

A division on the amendment was called and the motion was amended in the Government's favour, 34 to 30. The amended motion was then carried.

Members of the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Trade%20Organization"&gt;WTO&lt;/a&gt; have made statements in preparation of the next &lt;a href="w%3ADoha%20round"&gt;WTO meeting&lt;/a&gt; in December. 

Peter Mandelson, the EU's trade commissioner, has proposed a six-point package to help poor countries. The package includes guarantees of access to cheap drugs, special help for the 40 least-developed nations, compensation for poor countries affected by the loss of their access to Europe for bananas and sugar, relief for African cotton producers, and assistance to help countries build their capacity to trade. The EU is holding strong on its agriculture position while keeping internal dissent in check. Mandelson warned France not to veto any agreement saying that failure of the talks would be a "huge missed economic opportunity and a huge setback for multilateralism. Those who want to frustrate us, throw logs at us and impose vetoes on us - even from within our own ranks - will not find me giving up." Resistance is expected from the US, especially in the areas of textiles, and drugs. These two areas have been a areas of contention between the US and other WTO members. 

Several South American WTO members complained about the current sluggishness of talks. Brazil's WTO ambassador, Clodoaldo Hugueney, said earlier this week, "We are seriously concerned about the current state of the negotiations. The burden of adjustment is being placed on developing countries." 

The &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Monetary%20Fund"&gt;IMF&lt;/a&gt; also released a policy discussion paper titled "Africa in the Doha Round". In the paper, written by IMF Africa Department Senior Economist Yongzheng Yang, states that the representatives of Africa in the current round of WTO talks may be too fixated on the markets of wealthy nations. Yang writes, "African negotiators may have overlooked the potential market access gains in developing countries, where trade barriers remain relatively high and demand for African imports has expanded substantially." According to the paper Africa has primarily sought access of wealthiest nations including the US and the EU while limiting it's attention to China and other countries who imported 30 percent of Africa's exports. Recent trade issues Africa has pushed have included cotton exports, an area that has met much resistance to the wealthier WTO members. IMF policy discussion papers describe research in progress and are not opinions of the IMF.

The WTO has also agreed to extend an exemption for members classified as "least developed" from intellectual property rules until July 2013. These members already have an exemption, valid until 2016, for pharmaceutical products. The new extension applies to trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and geographical names indicating goods' place of origin. If a country improves out of the classification, the exemption will no longer apply.

Mayor Scott Jewell of the city of &lt;a href="w%3ADyer%2C%20Tennessee"&gt;Dyer, Tennessee&lt;/a&gt; did not issue a "stop work order" to Dyer Grain Company late Tuesday afternoon as had been expected. The order would have temporarily halted construction of new grain storage tanks.

Dyer Grain's efforts at expansion have been blocked several times over the past few years both by zoning restrictions on the height of structures and by citizens groups who filed suit against the grain company and the city's board of zoning appeals. The lawsuit was dismissed two months ago. The Dyer City Council then amended the zoning ordinance to include "grain storage tanks and bins" in a section of the ordinance listing exclusions, such as free standing spires and towers, to the regular 40 foot height restriction on buildings.

Several citizens spoke at the November 28 city council meeting to address alleged deficiencies in the building permit issued to Dyer Grain. The citizens claimed that according to the site plan filed with the application for the permit, the location of the tanks will violate another provision in the zoning ordinance restricting the height of all structures to the distance from surrounding property lines plus ten feet. The citizens were also concerned over a "grain conveyor" that will cross a city street. Mayor Jewell indicated that he would contact the Gibson County building inspector (who is contracted by the city to act as the municipal inspector) to research the citizens' concerns.

Jewell contacted Ricky Bailey, Gibson County Building inspector, on Wednesday. Bailey reportedly could find no deficiencies with the permit and, based on this advice, Jewell chose not to issue the stop work order himself. The City Council could still meet and vote to issue the order. The council meets the second Monday of each month.

"The main problem is that the grain company is in an industrial zone -- which is located smack in the middle of a low-density residential zone." Nathan Reed, an elected Alderman of Dyer said, "The property values in the area have increased (with inflation) but not at the same rate as other properties."

Normal buildings, such as offices and warehouses, can't exceed 40' plus 10' to the eave. The requested change in the ordinance changes the status of the towers from a building to the same status of an antenna or tower.

Mr Reed added, "The height to the eave is 76', the height to the top of the tank is 105', the height to the top of the elevator (atop the tank) is 133'. The 133' is the only measurement that matters now because the change to the zoning ordinance means this is no longer a "building", but rather the same as an antenna or tower."

"The grain company specifically requested that change to the ordinace -- which was opposed by several citizens...They can build it as high as they like so long as it conforms to the overal height restriction for towers, spires, etc."

Mr Reed commented on additional concerns, "The citizens are concerned about the health effects of (additional) grain dust, noise, and grain explosions."

The new construction is expected to generate annual property tax revenues of $10,000 to $16,000.

Stan Berenstain, co-creator of the popular &lt;a href="w%3ABerenstain%20Bears"&gt;Berenstain Bears&lt;/a&gt; children's books, has died due to complications from &lt;a href="w%3ACancer"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; at age 82. Along with his wife, Jan Berenstain, &lt;a href="w%3AStan%20and%20Jan%20Berenstain"&gt;Stan and Jan Berenstain&lt;/a&gt; published over 200 books aimed at teaching children to read and helping them with lessons such as sharing, new siblings.

The first Berenstain Bears book was published in 1962 and titled "The Big Honey Hunt". With the help of head of children's publishing at &lt;a href="w%3ARandom%20House"&gt;Random House&lt;/a&gt;, author &lt;a href="w%3ADr.%20Seuss"&gt;Theodor Geisel&lt;/a&gt;, better known as &lt;a href="w%3ADr.%20Seuss"&gt;Dr. Seuss&lt;/a&gt;, the Berenstains created a franchise that drew millions of young readers. 

Until 1997, when they hired an employee to run the company's computer, Mr. Berenstain and his family managed the entire ursine enterprise, which has branched out into two television series, videos, stage musicals, toys, cereal and other products.

According to an interview of the Berenstain Bears official website, Papa Bear is based on Stan, Mama on Jan; Stan clarifies that he's "not as stupid" as Papa.

Stan fed his interest in drawing as a child, by drawing on paper bags and cardboard.

Surgeons in &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; have performed a &lt;a href="w%3AFace%20transplant"&gt;face transplant&lt;/a&gt; operation on a French woman who had lost her nose, lips and chin after being savaged by a dog. According to Iain Hutchison, an oral-facial surgeon at Barts and the London Hospital, the transplant is the first one to use skin from another person.

Doctors say the woman's new face will be a "hybrid" between her donor's face and her own face before the attack. In the five hour long operation, the donor's tissues, muscles, arteries and veins were attached to the patient's lower face. It is more favourable to use skin from another person's face instead of skin from another part of the patient's body, as the texture and colour of the skin are more likely to match.

A statement released by the hospital in Amiens said that the 38-year-old patient, who wishes to remain anonymous, has not been able to eat or speak properly since the attack in May this year. The woman was reportedly in "excellent general health" and her graft looked normal.

&lt;a href="w%3Aethics"&gt;Ethical&lt;/a&gt; concerns, &lt;a href="w%3Apsychology"&gt;psychological&lt;/a&gt; impact, concerns relating to &lt;a href="w%3AImmunosuppression"&gt;immunosuppression&lt;/a&gt; and consequences of technical failure have prevented teams from performing face transplant operations in the past, even though it has been technically possible to carry out such procedures for years.

Mr Hutchison warned of several problems with face transplants, such as blood vessels in the donated tissue clotting and immunosuppressants failing or increasing the patient's risk of cancer. He also pointed out ethical issues with the fact that the procedure requires a "beating heart donor". The transplant is carried out while the donor is brain dead, but still alive by use of a ventilator.

According to Stephen Wigmore, chair of British Transplantation Society's ethics committee, it is unknown to what extent facial expressions will function in the long term. He said that it is not certain whether a patient could be left worse off in the case of a face transplant failing.

Mr Michael Earley, a member of the Royal College of Surgeon's facial transplantation working party, commented that if successful, the transplant would be "a major breakthrough in facial reconstruction" and "a major step forward for the facially disfigured."

The &lt;a href="w%3AXbox%20360"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt; arrives on shelves in Europe on Friday, but many shoppers may likely leave stores empty handed.

It is expected that at least 300,000 consoles are being made available for the European launch later this week, with only 50,000 destined for the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;. Stores are reporting that they may not even have enough stock to fulfill all of their pre-orders.

Launched in the US last Tuesday, the Xbox 360 sold out at many retailers in a matter of hours. The console can be found on &lt;a href="w%3AEBay"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt; however, although most prices are significantly marked up from retail, some as high as $700 &lt;a href="w%3AUSD"&gt;USD&lt;/a&gt;.

The console launches worldwide in two versions: a standard version, costing £279.99, and a core version at £209.99. The Core version does not include a hard disk which is required to play games created for the original &lt;a href="w%3AXbox"&gt;Xbox&lt;/a&gt;.

The Xbox 360 will be launched in &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; on December 10. This is the first time a console has been launched in the three major markets (North America, Europe and Japan) in such a short time.

U.S. &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; re-stated his commitment to withdraw troops from &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; and outlined goals for training Iraqi security forces that will guide such withdrawal. The presidential speech followed from a newly released White House document titled the &lt;a href="http%3A//georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/infocus/iraq/iraq_strategy_nov2005.html"&gt;National Strategy for Victory in Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. White House Press Secretary &lt;a href="w%3AScott%20McCellen"&gt;Scott McCellen&lt;/a&gt; claimed that the strategy outlined is what the administration has been following since 2003, and said that the released document is simply an unclassified version of the same for the public to review.

This release follows growing public and congressional dissatisfaction over the continuing violence in Iraq, rising US and Iraqi death toll, revelations of corruption and misadministration in the reconstruction program and the administration's handling of the &lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20War"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt;. A day before the president's address, Sen. Hillary Clinton, in an E-mail to her supporters had said "Given years of assurances that the war was nearly over and that the insurgents were in their 'last throes,' this administration was either not being honest with the American people or did not know what was going on in Iraq." 

"As the Iraqi forces gain experience and the political process advances, we will be able to decrease our troop levels in Iraq without losing our capability to defeat the terrorists. These decisions about troop levels will be driven by the conditions on the ground in Iraq and the good judgment of our commanders," stated the President on Nov. 30 while speaking to Midshipmen at the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Naval%20Academy"&gt;United States Naval Academy&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AAnnapolis%2C%20Maryland"&gt;Annapolis, Maryland&lt;/a&gt;.

As was expected, Bush did not set a timeframe for U.S. troop withdrawal, which is in direct opposition to recent calls for such a timetable by congressional leaders. The administration and its supporters label such a timeframe as "artificial". In his speech, Bush characterized those calling for a withdrawal deadline as "sincere, but...sincerely wrong." and said "Setting an artificial deadline to withdraw would vindicate the terrorists' tactics of beheadings and suicide bombings and mass murder -- and invite new attacks on America." 

Bush admitted that there had been "some setbacks in training Iraq’s security forces," and that their performance is still “uneven in some areas." Earlier, in a congressional briefing, General Casey, the top U.S. commander in Iraq, had said that so far only one Iraqi battalion out of 120 being trained was capable of mounting operations without support from U.S. forces. The strategy document released also stated that "it's not realistic to expect a fully functioning democracy able to defeat its enemies three years after Saddam is finally removed from power," prompting questions about when the administration made such a determination. 

In the White House press briefing Scott McClellan did not directly answer a question about which, if any of the short, medium and long term goals set out in the strategy has been achieved, saying that "I want to say we've made real progress on all three fronts of the strategy for victory." Senate Majority leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn) echoed the same sentiment, saying " ... examining the results on the ground, it's clear that we continue to make progress on the political, security and economic fronts"

Senator &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Kerry"&gt;John Kerry&lt;/a&gt; (D-Mass), felt the President was ignoring what his own generals are telling him. 

"The large presence of American forces on the ground feeds the insurgency," stated Kerry. 

Democratic politicians generally dismissed the speech as a repeat of old rhetoric. 

&lt;a href="w%3AHarry%20Reid"&gt;Harry Reid&lt;/a&gt; (D-Nev), Senate minority leader, accused Bush of "recycling his tired rhetoric of 'stay the course'." According to Reid, Bush had "missed an opportunity to lay out a real strategy for success in Iraq that will bring our troops safely home."

Steve Clemons, director of the American Strategy Programme at the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20America%20Foundation"&gt;New America Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, said Bush's war aims failed to address the strains on U.S. armed forces imposed by Iraq. "It's a very expansive commitment and it blows by the structural questions," stated Clemons. He added that those problems could only be resolved by a withdrawal, changing the current rules limiting the frequency of combat tours for individual units, or by moving towards a draft. Clemons said Bush was trying to escape those problems by portraying Iraqi forces as more ready than they actually are. 

Washington spends more than $6b a month to keep its forces in Iraq. More than 2,100 Americans and many more thousands of Iraqis have been killed since the March 2003 invasion.

The &lt;a href="w%3ALA%20Times"&gt;LA Times&lt;/a&gt; reported today that the U.S. is secretly paying Iraqi newspapers to publish stories written by American troops. While these stories are mostly factual, they present only one side of events and blend out parts that don't reflect favourably on U.S. or Iraqi governments. 

According to the report, the Pentagon hired the Lincoln Group, a Washington-based firm that translates the stories into Arabic and places them in Baghdad newspapers. When published, many of these articles are not marked as originating from the U.S. military, but presented as unbiased news reports, written by independent Iraqi journalists. The LA times quotes a senior military official, stating that "Absolute truth was not an essential element of these stories."

Earlier this year, the Bush administration came under criticism for distributing videos and news stories in the United States without identifying the federal government as its source, and paying American journalists to promote administration policies. The &lt;a href="w%3AGovernment%20Accountability%20Office"&gt;Government Accountability Office&lt;/a&gt; has characterized these practices as "covert &lt;a href="w%3Apropaganda"&gt;propaganda&lt;/a&gt;."

U.S. law only prevents the military from planting propaganda through American news outlets. Critics charge, however, that in the modern media environment, stories written for foreign news sources are likely to leak into American news.

The response from the Pentagon was mixed, with Rumsfeld's spokesperson Bryan Whitman saying that he was unaware of such practice, noting that "this article raises some question as to whether or not some of the practices that are described in there are consistent with the principles of this department." 

On the other hand, Lt. Col. Barry Johnson, a military spokesman in Iraq, said "This is a military program initiated with the Multi-National Force to help get factual information about ongoing operations into Iraqi news." 

"An important part of countering misinformation in the news by insurgents," added Johnson.
"I want to emphasize that all information used for marketing these stories is completely factual."

U.S. spokesperson Maj. Gen. Rick Lynch defended the practices.

"We do empower our operational commanders with the ability to inform the Iraqi public but everything we do is based on fact, not based on fiction," said Lynch.

John Schulz, a former executive with &lt;a href="w%3AVoice%20of%20America"&gt;Voice of America&lt;/a&gt; called the military program scary.

"The Bush administration, and some elements within the Defense Department do not seem to grasp the irony that, in their efforts to create, impose or inspire democratic society in Iraq, they are subverting the very core of what democracy means and are instead, by example, undercutting the very thing they are attempting to install in Iraq," said Schulz.

The US government released a preliminary report on the US economy today. The report, produced by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, states that the economy grew by 4.3 percent in the third quarter of 2005. In the second quarter of 2005, real GDP increased 3.3 percent. 

The rise is attributed to increases in personal consumption (4.2 percent), equipment and software (10.8 percent), government spending, and residential fixed investment (8.4 percent). Imports, which deduct from the GDP, also increased. Exports, however, increased.

Government consumption expenditures increased 8.1 percent. National defense had an increase of 10.3 percent. Nondefense spending increased 3.6 percent.

Gross national product, which better reflects the economy in from the employee's perspective, increased 4.4 percent in the third quarter.

While discussing his reasons for opposing immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from &lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20War"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, Senator &lt;a href="w%3AOrrin%20Hatch"&gt;Orrin Hatch&lt;/a&gt; (R-Utah) had a slip of the tongue, accidentally referring to Iraq as &lt;a href="w%3AVietnam%20War"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;. "The &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; seems to be taken over by the &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Moore"&gt;Michael Moore&lt;/a&gt; contingent in their attitude toward Vietnam, and they continually call for a withdrawal of troops at a time when we haven't finished the job." Hatch was speaking on &lt;a href="w%3AFox%20News%20Channel"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt;. His spokesman, Peter Carr, said that Senator Hatch became confused because he had been reading an article earlier in the day comparing the two conflicts.

Hatch has been a &lt;a href="w%3AUtah"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt; Senator since 1976, when he defeated &lt;a href="w%3AFrank%20Moss"&gt;Sen. Frank Moss&lt;/a&gt; (D) on a platform of term limits for U.S. Senators. He is currently running against Democrat &lt;a href="w%3APete%20Ashdown"&gt;Pete Ashdown&lt;/a&gt; for another term, and is expected to win re-election.

Convicted Australian drug trafficker &lt;a href="w%3ANguyen%20Tuong%20Van"&gt;Van Nguyen&lt;/a&gt; will be executed at Singapore's &lt;a href="w%3AChangi%20Prison"&gt;Changi prison&lt;/a&gt; tomorrow at 6:00am SGT (8:00pm tonight UTC, 9:00am AEST). Nguyen was caught with 396.2 grams of &lt;a href="w%3AHeroin"&gt;heroin&lt;/a&gt;, more than 25 times the amount that mandates a death sentence.

Following an appeal to the Prime Minister of Singapore, &lt;a href="w%3ALee%20Hsien%20Loong"&gt;Lee Hsien Loong&lt;/a&gt; by Australian Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt;, Nguyen was able to hold hands with his mother and brother as he said goodbye for the last time. 

Supporters will hold a vigil outside the prison before his death.

On December 2, &lt;a href="w%3ANguyen%20Tuong%20Van"&gt;Nguyen&lt;/a&gt; will be handcuffed and taken to the &lt;a href="w%3AGallows"&gt;gallows&lt;/a&gt; in Singapore's &lt;a href="w%3AChangi%20Prison"&gt;Changi Prison&lt;/a&gt; to be hanged for drug trafficking.

They voiced their protest in an statement called " A Call for Justice". The statement reads: "… For detailed reasons, which are beyond the realm of this statement, renowned international legal experts have concluded that there is no legal basis for the proscription of the People's Mojahedin Organisation of Iran - PMOI. Terror tag on the Mujahedin is the by-product of the failed policy of appeasement with the Islamic Republic of Iran. Continuing the MEK proscription is nothing by more concession to the mullahs with serious consequences both for the region and world peace. "

The MEK is militant organisation seeking to overthrow the government of the &lt;a href="w%3AIslamic%20Republic%20of%20Iran"&gt;Islamic Republic of Iran&lt;/a&gt;. Apart from the EU, the United States also consider the MEK to be a &lt;a href="w%3AForeign%20Terrorist%20Organisation"&gt;Foreign Terrorist Organisation&lt;/a&gt;.

Reuters reports that around 400 armed men launched an attack on the town of Ramadi, seizing control of various streets in the inner city. They allegedly set up checkpoints and distributed leaflets declaring that Al-Qaeda in Iraq, a group led by Jordanian militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, was taking over the city. 

Reuters reports that there were no U.S. forces in the streets and that the U.S. military did not immediately respond to a request for information about the situation.

Ramadi is at the south-west of the so-called Sunni Triangle and its population-size is around 400'000.

Convicted &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; drug trafficker &lt;a href="w%3AVan%20Tuong%20Nguyen"&gt;Van Tuong Nguyen&lt;/a&gt; has been denied permission to embrace his mother and twin brother before his execution. 

Following a request from Nguyen’s mother, Kim Nguyen, and supported by strong international pressure, &lt;a href="w%3ASingapore"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt; refused a contact visit, but will allow them to hold hands.

In a statement released by Singapore’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, government officials said contact visits were too traumatic and destabilising for both prisoners and family members. 

In response, Australia’s Foreign Minister, &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Downer"&gt;Alexander Downer&lt;/a&gt;, said, "My view is that a prisoner who is to be executed confronts the greatest of all destabilisation to have his life taken away from him, so I don't really identify with that statement.”

Mr Downer then conceded that "it'll perhaps be very meagre compensation, of course it will be, but it will be nice that they can touch each other…it's better than nothing."

An unnamed Singaporean lawyer claimed contact would be made through a hole in the wall. "I think they will bring him to another room and there will be an aperture through which they can reach,” the lawyer said.

The 25-year-old Australian man was convicted of trafficking 396 grams of heroin, an offence which carries a mandatory death penalty under Singapore law. He received no remissions for a full confession.

He will be executed by hanging at 09:00 AEDT tomorrow.

Meanwhile, Australians attended protest vigils in Sydney and Melbourne tonight. Tim Goodwin from &lt;a href="w%3AAmnesty%20International"&gt;Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt; told the Sydney crowd that the death penalty is not an acceptable punishment. "It is ineffective, it is dangerous, it is extreme and it is the most barbaric, brutalising punishment," he said.

The Institute of Quantum Optics and Quantum Information at the &lt;a href="w%3ALeopold-Franzens-Universit%C3%A4t"&gt;University of Innsbruck&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AAustria"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt; has created an &lt;a href="w%3AQuantum%20entanglement"&gt;entanglement&lt;/a&gt; of eight quantum particles, yielding a quantum byte or "qubyte", or eight &lt;a href="w%3AQubit"&gt;qubits&lt;/a&gt;. This is an important step toward the realization of a practical &lt;a href="w%3AQuantum%20computer"&gt;quantum computer&lt;/a&gt;, which would use superposed quantum states to perform complex calculations. A detailed writeup of this work is available in 
&lt;a href="http%3A//heart-c704.uibk.ac.at/index.html"&gt;English and German&lt;/a&gt;. The formal paper was published in the December 1 issue of &lt;a href="w%3ANature%20%28journal%29"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;.

Contributors to the breakthrough are researchers from IQOQI under the supervision of Rainer Blatt and Hartmut Häffner in coaction with Otfried Gühne and Wolfgang Dür of the Innsbruck research group directed by Hans Jürgen Briegelhave.

With a trap using magnetic fields they captured eight calcium ions, lined them up, and set them up in "W states" using a complicated laser technology. A quantum byte with eight ions provides a computing matrix of 65,536 (0-255 x 0-255) elements that are mostly independent. It is suggested that the method should be scalable so that the number of ions could be increased. This experiment proves that the kind of ion traps used in Innsbruck are the most promising technology for the realization of large computing matrices.

Convicted &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; drug trafficker &lt;a href="w%3AVan%20Tuong%20Nguyen"&gt;Van Tuong Nguyen&lt;/a&gt; was executed at &lt;a href="w%3AChangi%20Prison"&gt;Changi Prison&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASingapore"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt; today. Prison officials have confirmed the execution took place at 0900 AEDT (2200 UTC Thursday). 

The 25-year-old Nguyen was arrested at Changi Airport in December, 2002, while in transit from &lt;a href="w%3ACambodia"&gt;Cambodia&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;. He was found to be in possession of 396.2 grams of heroin. He was convicted in the &lt;a href="w%3ASingapore%20High%20Court"&gt;Singapore High Court&lt;/a&gt; and sentenced to death under the &lt;a href="w%3AMisuse%20of%20Drugs%20Act"&gt;Misuse of Drugs Act&lt;/a&gt; which mandates a death sentence for trafficking more than 15 grams of heroin. 

All appeals for clemency were rejected. Singapore's High Commissioner in Australia, &lt;a href="w%3AJoseph%20Koh"&gt;Joseph Koh&lt;/a&gt;, said Singapore carefully considered appeals from Australia but decided the law must be applied consistently. "It had to treat Nguyen consistently with similar past cases, and apply the law equally to Singaporeans and foreigners," Mr Koh said.

After saying goodbye to his client, Nguyen's Australian lawyer, Julian McMahon, said Nguyen's execution was a waste. "He is completely rehabilitated, completely reformed, completely focused on doing what is good and now they're going to kill him," he said.

It was previously reported that Nguyen's mother would not be permitted to embrace her son before the execution, however, Mr McMahon has confirmed that they were allowed some physical contact. "Well I actually wasn't in the room when that happened but there was a grill and they were able to hold each other's hands and Kim was able to, at least for some time, I'm not sure how long, was able to touch Van on the face," he said. "She told me she was able to talk to him and touch his hair. That was a great comfort to her."

Prayer vigils were held outside Changi Prison and around Australia to mark the first execution of an Australian since &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20McAuliffe"&gt;Michael McAuliffe&lt;/a&gt; in Malaysia in 1993. Nguyen's body is expected to be returned to Australia on Saturday for a funeral next week.

The &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href="Australian%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; sits for an unusual extra day today, in order to finish considering amendments to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWorkChoices"&gt;new industial relations legislation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . An extended sitting of the Senate was held yesterday, December 1, considering these amendments. 

The bill has been declared as urgent and as consequently a timetable for debate is set, so the bill would have either passed or not in its entirety today. Key senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABarnaby%20Joyce"&gt;Barnaby Joyce&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has expressed his support of the bill due to his influencing Government amendments dealing with public holidays. Non-Government senators expressed their concerns yesterday and today in regard to these amendments &amp;mdash; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFamily%20First%20Party"&gt;Family First Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Fielding"&gt;Stephen Fielding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; introduced amendment to try and complement the Government amendments, but the Government has expressed that they will not be supporting them as they do not contain "right to refuse" provisions.

The Senate had not finished debate on all the amendments in the nine page outline of business before 4.30 pm, the time set by the earlier guillotine, and the amendments were consequently put without debate. Non-Government members did not pursue divisions on all the amendments other than key ones. Ominously, during the following third reading debate, fierce thunderstorms had brought about the use of emergency power to the parliament with Opposition senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APenny%20Wong"&gt;Penny Wong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; saying that "The lights
may have just gone out in the Senate chamber, but they
do not go out on the labour movement!". Persons in the gallery of the Senate were applauding to non-Government speeches, which brought about support from the Opposition and skepticism from Government senators saying that "no amount of guffaws from those who have been trundled in here today to stand up the back will change the fact that we have been re-elected four times by Australian working men and women."

Due to Government numbers, the bill eventually passed the third reading debate.

The Australian Federal Opposition has hounded the Treasurer, &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Costello"&gt;Peter Costello&lt;/a&gt;, over the appointment of &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Gerard"&gt;Robert Gerard&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="w%3AReserve%20Bank%20of%20Australia"&gt;Reserve Bank of Australia&lt;/a&gt; (RBA) board. Mr Gerard announced on Friday 2nd that he will resign from the Board, citing the events of this week as the reason.

On Tuesday, November 29, &lt;a href="w%3AWayne%20Swan"&gt;Wayne Swan&lt;/a&gt;, the Shadow Treasurer asked of Costello in the first question of &lt;a href="w%3AQuestion%20Time"&gt;Question Time&lt;/a&gt; about an apparent statement that Costello made to Gerard, namely, "I know there's an issue with the Tax Office but I don't have a problem with you on the board". Costello responded that he had no problem with Gerard, noting that "he brings a great understanding of Australian manufacturing industry to the board", and that the obligatory declaration of interest was "indeed was signed by Mr Gerard".

Later it was said by Swan in the &lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; that Gerard's company was using "tax havens as tax avoidance schemes to the value of $150 million" and that the declaration of interest mentioned was only in regard to his personal affairs and on asking the Treasurer when he knew this, claimed that him actually knowing the information "would breach the secrecy act". Later Swan revealed that Gerard "and his corporate vehicles" have been "susbtantial donors" to the Liberal Party. Costello maintained that the Government "[does] not think that supporting the Liberal Party is a disqualification from holding ministerial office, prime ministerial office, Treasury office or other offices in Australia"

Swan moved a censure motion to "provide this House with a full and proper explanation of...his communications with Mr Robert Gerard...and his knowledge of Mr Robert Gerard's dispute with the Australian Taxation Office...", which failed in the Government's favour with votes 83 to 59 in division.

On Wednesday, November 30, Swan opened the House in a movement to suspend standing orders again to get information from the Treasurer, stating that "The Treasurer is in real strife" before the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer moved the gag. In Question Time, the Opposition continued to ask every question in regard to the appointment of Gerard. The Leader of the Opposition &lt;a href="w%3AKim%20Beazley"&gt;Kim Beazley&lt;/a&gt; revealed in his question to the Treasurer that "some of his cabinet colleagues have privately said that they did not consider Mr Gerard was 'a good choice' in the first place for the Reserve Bank board". The Treasurer responded that Gerard's "appointment was supported by all
members of the cabinet"

In the subsequent Matters of Public Importance debate, the matter selected was that proposed by Wayne Swan, namely, "The need for the Treasurer to uphold the highest standards of probity in the selection of candidates for the Reserve Bank Board."

On Thursday, December 1, the Opposition again reserved a number of its questions for inquiring about Gerard's appointment. Swan revealed in a question to the Treasurer that Gerard Corporation had "acquired an investment company in the tax haven of the British Virgin Islands eight months after the Treasurer recommended his appointment to the Reserve Bank board". Costello responded to Swan referring him to "a statement about that allegation in the ♡❤Australian Financial Review♡❤ today...in which he makes it clear that no income
has been derived."

Later, the Leader of the Opposition tried to move a censure motion on the treasurer, but leave of the House was not granted, so he had to resort to moving a motion to suspend standing orders to move the same motion, to censure the Treasurer for his appointment. The motion failed due to Government numbers, but the Matters for Public Importance (which follows Question Time) which was selected as "The need for the Government to govern for all Australians
not just a privileged few." in order to draw a comparison with the unequal treatment of the Treasurer in supporting Gerard and the &lt;a href="w%3AWorkChoices"&gt;new industrial relations legislation&lt;/a&gt;, dubbed WorkChoices, and said how the Treasurer and the Prime Minister were "laughing up their sleeves", that the Treasurer was "not fit to lead", and Gerard "is the worst attendee on the Reserve Bank board." 

The Minister for Workplace Relations, Kevin Andrews, however focused elsewhere on the MPI, and drew the attention of the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Australian Labor Party&lt;/a&gt;'s ties to the unions, had described the Opposition as a "policy free zone", said that "there is one group that represents privilege in this place and that is the Australian Labor Party", and stressed the benefits of WorkChoices.

&lt;a href="w%3ACraig%20Emerson"&gt;Craig Emerson&lt;/a&gt; noted that the Queensland branch of the Liberal Party participated in "deliberate tax evasion", and that Mr Gerard "paid penalty tax in circumstances of deliberate tax evasion". Emerson later said that the Liberal Party was "soft on tax cheats", "soft on tax cheating Liberal Party donors...and members".

The adjournment debate also brought up criticism of Gerard's appointment in the adjournment debate. &lt;a href="w%3AChristopher%20Bowen"&gt;Christopher Bowen&lt;/a&gt; noted the "disquiet" in the media, and noted the previous Board member Bernie Fraser also calling for his dismissal. &lt;a href="w%3ABernard%20Ripoll"&gt;Bernard Ripoll&lt;/a&gt; called for a "full inquiry" into the Government's "self serving public policy".

Swan has said that Gerard had done the "honourable thing", but that he will not let up on pressing the Treasurer for a full disclosal of the facts.

The House of Representatives as of this date sits next on December 5, 2005.

In Campbelltown, Australia, a 36-year-old carpenter faced the local court with charges stemming from five offences relating to the November 9 assault of a Northmead teenager named Lauren Huxley. Robert Black Farmer, also a resident of Northmead, was arrested by NSW State Protection Group officers.

Ms. Huxley was bashed unconscious, gagged, tied up and doused in &lt;a href="w%3Apetrol"&gt;petrol&lt;/a&gt;. Her attacker then set fire to the house and fled the scene. Firefighters rescued her from the floor of the garage. The 18-year-old remains in a critical condition in intensive care at Sydney’s Westmead Hospital.

Police prosecutor Jennifer Chenhall told the court detectives have collected a large amount of &lt;a href="w%3Aforensic%20evidence"&gt;forensic evidence&lt;/a&gt; and have taken numerous statements. One of the charges against Farmer relating to the assault includes causing grievous bodily harm with intent to murder. He did not apply for &lt;a href="w%3Abail"&gt;bail&lt;/a&gt; and was remanded into custody to face Parramatta Local Court on January 19, 2006.

The arrest comes days after NSW Police Commissioner, Ken Moroney, condemned the attack as the worst he had seen in his 40 years of policing and promised that detectives would not rest until the guilty party was caught.

In what appeared to be a hostage situation ended in tragedy this afternoon in the quiet &lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; town of &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Reading%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;North Reading&lt;/a&gt; when the body of a 72-year old man, Roaldas Baran, and his 65-year old wife, Zinaida Girdauskiene, were found dead in an apparent &lt;a href="w%3Amurder-suicide"&gt;murder-suicide&lt;/a&gt; at 14 Country Club Road.

The situation began when a neighbor heard four gunshots and a woman screaming and called &lt;a href="w%3A9-1-1"&gt;9-1-1&lt;/a&gt;. Police arrived at the home, and encountered the 72-year old man standing over, a brief conversation was held with the man who then went back inside the house. Then a fifth shot was fired. The &lt;a href="w%3ASWAT"&gt;SWAT&lt;/a&gt; team of the North Eastern Massachusetts Law Enforcement Council was brought in to clear the house and evacuate the surrounding houses. The &lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts%20State%20Police"&gt;Massachusetts State Police&lt;/a&gt; was also on hand.

Martha Coakley, the &lt;a href="w%3ADistrict%20Attorney"&gt;District Attorney&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="w%3AMiddlesex%20County%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Middlesex County&lt;/a&gt; reported on what was found upon the SWAT team entering the house. &lt;blockquote&gt;♡❤"In the bedroom, lying, apparently a victim of several gunshot wounds, was a female. We know her to be approximately 65-years-old. In the kitchen on the floor, also apparently the victim of a suicide, was a male we know now to be approximately 72-years-old who was her husband."♡❤&lt;/blockquote&gt; Emily LaGrassa, Coxley's spokeperson said the man apparently shot the woman and turned the gun on himself. Two guns were recovered.

North Reading Police had been called to the house once before in August 2004. The North Reading police are currently investigating further.

The United States Coast Guard is currently searching still for the downed Beechcraft twin-engine plane piloted by philanthropist George F. Baker III off the coast of Nantucket, Massachusetts. 

Air-traffic controllers lost radar contact with pilot during the afternoon, even though the pilot has just talked with them moments before. The plane also did not issue a distress signal.

Weather is not believed to be a factor as visibility was above five miles.

Yesterday, December 1, 2005, the election for the &lt;a href="w%3ABelg%20der%20Belgen"&gt;"Greatest Belgian" ("De Grootste Belg")&lt;/a&gt; was won by &lt;a href="w%3AFather%20Damien"&gt;Father Damien (Joseph De Veuster)&lt;/a&gt;. Runners up were &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Janssen"&gt;Dr. Paul Janssen&lt;/a&gt;, founder of Janssen Pharmaceutica, and &lt;a href="w%3AEddy%20Merckx"&gt;Eddy Merkx&lt;/a&gt;, a cyclist.

&lt;a href="w%3AFather%20Damien"&gt;Father Damien&lt;/a&gt; is famous for working and living with lepers on Molokai, where he persisted in caring for the outcasts, against directions of church hierarchy. Eventually, &lt;a href="w%3AFather%20Damien"&gt;Father Damien&lt;/a&gt; died from leprosy himself.

The Belgian "Greatest National" poll is organized separately by the Flemish and the Walloon regional television stations. &lt;a href="w%3AFather%20Damien"&gt;Father Damien&lt;/a&gt; was elected &lt;a href="w%3ABelg%20der%20Belgen"&gt;"Greatest Belgian" ("De Grootste Belg")&lt;/a&gt; in the poll organized by the Flemish television. Next week, the Walloon poll will conclude, so Belgium will have two &lt;a href="w%3ABelg%20der%20Belgen"&gt;"Greatest Belgians"&lt;/a&gt;.

After Kenyans &lt;a href="w%3AKenyan%20constitutional%20referendum%2C%202005"&gt;voted "no" for the implementation of the new constitution&lt;/a&gt;, the "Orange" anti-constitution campaign and the "Banana" pro-constitution campaign finally sat down together to discuss the way forward. 

The draft constitution would have banned foreign land ownership, set the prime minister position to report to the country's president, banned same-sex marriages and restricted regional political parties. It would have also given women equal rights to inherit property, and addressed local elections. The country was attempting to rewrite its post-colonial constitution. This draft constitution was brought forward by the Attorney General, &lt;a href="w%3AAmos%20Wako"&gt;Amos Wako&lt;/a&gt;. 

A day after the results were announced, the President of the country, &lt;a href="w%3AMwai%20Kibaki"&gt;Mwai Kibaki&lt;/a&gt;, fired his whole cabinet. It is not yet known what he plans to do, but hopes for reconciliation are high: a member of the opposition called on the president "to provide leadership in the way forward".

The &lt;a href="http%3A//www.nyclu.org"&gt;New York Civil Liberties Union&lt;/a&gt; lost their court battle today regarding the constitutionality of the New York Police Department's policy of conducting random bag searches in the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.mta.info"&gt;New York City Subway&lt;/a&gt; system, which took effect July 21, 2005, in the wake of the attacks on the London Underground.

Finding that "the risk of a terrorist bombing of New York City's subway system is real and substantial," U.S. District Judge Richard M. Berman ruled that random bag searches are not as intrusive as alleged by the NYCLU. Justice Berman noted that "the threat of terrorism is great and the consequences of unpreparedness may be catastrophic", and reasoned that it would be folly not to allow random searches to take place. Former counterterrorism official Richard Clarke, testified that the unpredictability of the city's searches would deter potential terrorists.

NYCLU legal director Christopher Dunn disagreed with the court's ruling, and believes the decision gives too much power for vague and unsubstantiated threats. "While concerns about terrorism may well justify certain extraordinary measures, they cannot support an indefinite program by which police officers are searching hundreds of thousands of innocent New Yorkers seeking to do nothing more than ride the subway."

There are no known plans for appeal by the NYCLU, nor word from the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.mta.info"&gt;MTA&lt;/a&gt; if the policy will be expanded to its other transit systems, such as the city's busses, the Long Island Railroad, and Metro-North Railroad.

The body of former &lt;a href="w%3AManchester%20United"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt; player, &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Best"&gt;George Best&lt;/a&gt;, has arrived in &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Ireland"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. It was flown into &lt;a href="w%3ARAF%20Aldergrove"&gt;RAF Aldergrove&lt;/a&gt;, on a chartered plane accompanied by his son, Calum, and his agent, Phil Hughes. Bests Family, including his father Dickie were waiting at the runway of RAF base in &lt;a href="w%3ACounty%20Antrim"&gt;County Antrim&lt;/a&gt;.

Mr.Bests body was then driven in a black herse along a 20-mile route to the home of Best's father, Dickie, in the Cregagh Estate in east &lt;a href="w%3ABelfast"&gt;Belfast&lt;/a&gt;, where it will be kept overnight.

Up to 500,000 people are expected to line the streets to Stormont, the &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Ireland%20Parliament"&gt;Northern Ireland Parliament&lt;/a&gt; buildings, where a public funeral ceremony for the former Manchester United and Northern Ireland football player will be held tomorrow.

Mr Best died at the &lt;a href="w%3ACromwell%20Hospital"&gt;Cromwell Hospital&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; last Friday afternoon, aged 59. A private family service will be held at Best's Fathers home, which has been turned into a shrine to his son. Then a service will take place in the Great Hall at Stormont, before Best is buried in a private family service beside his mother Ann at Roselawn Cemetery. Among the people attending the private ceremony will be Best's lifelong friend Denis Law, Harry Gregg and Derek Dougan.

A U.S. federal judge ruled on Nov. 28 that 17-year old Charlene Nguon can sue her high school principal who revealed to her mother that she is &lt;a href="w%3A%20Lesbian"&gt;lesbian&lt;/a&gt;.

The lawsuit, brought in September by a high school senior in &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, claims she was unfairly disciplined by the school for kissing her girlfriend. She also alleges that her sexuality caused the school to suspend her when there was no specific policy addressing displays of public affection in the student handbook, and that her privacy rights were violated when the school principal revealed to her parents that she was lesbian.

The school district sought to have the charges dismissed by arguing in part that Nguon was openly gay on campus, and therefore had no right to privacy on the matter.

Judge James V. Selna of the Central District Court of California found that the school district was immune from the plaintiff’s claims in a 13-page finding issued on Monday. However, the individual administrators, the school principal and superintendent, did not qualify for immunity. In his findings he noted that the administrators did not take "action to stop or remedy the alleged harassment and discrimination", and did not enact an "adequate formal or informal policy to ensure that Santiago High is providing a learning environment free from discrimination", which is a requirement of the California Education Code.

In allowing the lawsuit to move forward, Judge Selna found that Nguon had "sufficiently alleged a legally protected privacy interest in information about her sexual orientation." 

Nguon is seeking unspecified damages and is being represented by the &lt;a href="w%3A%20American%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union"&gt;American Civil Liberties Union&lt;/a&gt; of Southern California. 

"This is the first court ruling we’re aware of where a judge has recognized that a student has a right not to have her sexual orientation disclosed to her parents," said Christine Sun, Nguon's lawyer.

Nguon was found in the hallway openly kissing and hugging her girlfriend, actions permitted between heterosexual students at the Santiago High School in &lt;a href="w%3AGarden%20Grove%2C%20California"&gt;Garden Grove, California&lt;/a&gt;. The school principal, Ben Wolf, told Nguon's mother about her daughter's sexuality after the student failed to stop the displays of affection between her and her girlfriend. During this time, Nguon was suspended numerous times for ignoring the requests, and was ultimately forced to temporarily change schools.

No trial date is set. The parties are scheduled to return to court on Jan. 23.

Thousands of people across &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; are taking part in protests calling on the Federal Government to ratify the &lt;a href="w%3AKyoto%20Protocol"&gt;Kyoto Protocol&lt;/a&gt;. The 'Walk Against Warming' is part of an international day of action in 40 countries, coinciding with the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Framework%20Convention%20on%20Climate%20Change"&gt;United Nations climate change talks&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AMontreal"&gt;Montreal&lt;/a&gt;, Quebec, Canada.

According to the Walk Against Warming group, "the need to reduce greenhouse gases is at crisis point, we must act now for the sustainability of our planet for future generations."

Melinda Cook, Nature Conservation Council of &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; official, says governments need to take much stronger action on the issue of &lt;a href="w%3AClimate%20change"&gt;Climate Change&lt;/a&gt;. 

"This international day has been called to put pressure on Australia and the US to ratify and to make sure governments are aware that the community is demanding serious commitments and action on greenhouse gas reduction," said Cook.

Siding with the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AGovernment%20of%20Australia"&gt;Australian Federal Government&lt;/a&gt; has refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol on climate change, arguing it is damaging to their economic interests. &lt;a href="w%3AIan%20Campbell%20%28Australian%20politician%29"&gt;Federal Environment Minister Ian Campbell&lt;/a&gt; says Australia is focused on measures that should be taken after Kyoto expires in 2012.

"We need to do something that suits the developed world, something that suits the rapidly developing world, partnerships, technologies, economic mechanisms that drive us towards that," said Campbell. "We're nowhere near that at the moment and Australia wants to be a constructive part of driving us towards a very useful post-Kyoto regime."

Protesters across Australia are using the International Day of Action on Climate Change to demand the government adopt a clean energy policy. Hundreds of people marched through Sydney on Saturday to mark the day. 

The protest against &lt;a href="w%3AGlobal%20warming"&gt;global warming&lt;/a&gt; coincides with the 12-day conference in Montreal, which will discuss climate change measures and future international action when the Kyoto Protocol expires at the end of 2012. Australia and the United States are the only western industrialised nations which refuse to ratify the global Kyoto Protocol. Australia has delegates at the Montreal meeting, but will only act as observers.

Melinda Cook said scientists had predicted huge negative consequences including extreme weather and even social and economic impacts if steps were not taken now. Cook also said governments must make a "serious commitment" not to build any more coal fire powered stations.

The United States Bush administration and the Australian Howard Government have refused to ratify the Kyoto agreement, which pledges industrialised nations to cut carbon dioxide levels to 5.2 per cent below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012.

♡❤♡Global Action♡❤♡

Up to a million people will take to the streets of more than 100 cities across dozens of countries today to demand greater action on global warming. Organizers of the protests say the world's leading industrialised nations had failed to make an impact on climate change and some, in particular &lt;a href="w%3ABritain"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt;, were backsliding on their environmental commitments.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; meeting in Montreal, will be attended by representatives of 189 countries. The centerpiece of the International Day of Climate Protest will be a mass protest in Montreal, where at least 15,000 people are expected to lobby delegates.

Across the planet, protests are being held in locations from Helsinki to Seoul. In &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;, drivers of fuel-efficient hybrid cars will rally around the &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Orleans%2C%20Louisiana"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt; - devastated by &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt; in August - there will be a "Stop Global Warming" street party in the French Quarter.

"There is probably very little we can expect [from Montreal] because we are doing nothing to keep fossil fuel in the ground. All these techno-fixes are a waste of time if we continue to burn fossil fuel at the same rate," said &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Monbiot"&gt;George Monbiot&lt;/a&gt;, an academic and environment commentator, who will address a rally in &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;.

"There is a lot of cynicism about what the British government is doing. [Prime Minister] &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; has promised much and persuaded many that he will deliver but it has turned out to be rubbish. Blair had no intention of doing anything on climate change other than talk about it. But this weekend's protests are taking place in a changed context - the media are listening and finally we have to make the politicians listen."

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Timor"&gt;East Timor&lt;/a&gt; officials signed a billion-dollar gas and oil &lt;a href="w%3Aaccord"&gt;accord&lt;/a&gt;, which is necessary because of a current &lt;a href="w%3Amaritime"&gt;maritime border&lt;/a&gt; dispute between the countries, which covers a major oil field. Although the accord has to be &lt;a href="w%3Aratified"&gt;ratified&lt;/a&gt; by East Timor's parliament which is ruled by Fretilin with 55 seats the biggest block in &lt;a href="w%3Aparliament"&gt;parliament&lt;/a&gt;, but all the smaller parties are said to be working together to veto the deal.

In 1975, &lt;a href="w%3APortugal"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt; abandoned East Timor and the people declared self-independence only to be invaded by &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; with out any intervention from Australia or the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. Indonesia then agreed on no formal maritime boards but on a joint exploitation zone splitting profits 50/50. Indonesian rule in East Timor was marked by extreme violence and &lt;a href="w%3Abrutality"&gt;brutality&lt;/a&gt; and following a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;UN-sponsored&lt;/a&gt; agreement between Indonesia, Portugal and the US, East Timor held a &lt;a href="w%3Areferendum"&gt;referendum&lt;/a&gt; and gained independence, but violent Indonesian sponsored militia took hold. A peacekeeping force (INTERFET, led by Australia) then intervened putting a stop to the violence. The exploitation zone splitting profits was then changed to 60% in favour of Australia, but now a new deal has been proposed 90/10 in favour of Timor. In the mean time Australia has been accused of profiting by up to 2 billion dollars between the deals by activist groups like http://www.timorseajustice.org/ whose campaigning saw &lt;a href="w%3AWoodside%20Petroleum"&gt;Woodside&lt;/a&gt; suspended oil pumping in the affected area. 

Contemporary &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20law"&gt;International law&lt;/a&gt; asserts that the area under dispute belongs to East Timor. Australia has withdrawn from the maritime division of the International Court of Justice, which could have settled this matter, instead opting to try to settle the matter without the court.

The previous deal has caused political infighting within East Timor about why such a smaller percentage was accepted.

Double murderer &lt;a href="w%3AKenneth%20Lee%20Boyd"&gt;Kenneth Lee Boyd&lt;/a&gt; became the 1,000th prisoner &lt;a href="w%3ACapital%20punishment%20in%20the%20United%20States"&gt;executed in the United States&lt;/a&gt; since 1976. Another man was put to death on Friday for the 1994 murder of a store clerk, becoming the 1,001st person executed in the United States since &lt;a href="w%3ACapital%20punishment"&gt;capital punishment&lt;/a&gt; was reinstated 28 years ago.

The milestone drew a wave of protesters to the Central Prison in &lt;a href="w%3ARaleigh%2C%20N.C."&gt;Raleigh, N.C.&lt;/a&gt;, who opposed capital punishment.

Kenneth Lee Boyd, 57, of Rockingham, N.C., died by &lt;a href="w%3Alethal%20injection"&gt;lethal injection&lt;/a&gt; for the 1988 shootings of his estranged wife, Julie Curry Boyd, who was 36, and her father, Thomas Dillard Curry, 57. Members of both families had asked to be present for the execution.

Boyd told Associated Press in a prison interview that he wanted no part of the infamous numerical distinction of being the 1000th prisoner executed. "I'd hate to be remembered as that," Boyd said on Wednesday. "I don't like the idea of being picked as a number." 

Some argued that Boyd, who had an &lt;a href="w%3AIntelligence%20quotient"&gt;I.Q.&lt;/a&gt; of 77, should not have been executed. The cutoff for mental retardation in some states, a mitigating factor in some capital cases, is an I.Q. of 75. Boyd never denied his guilt, but said he couldn't remember killing anyone and didn't know why he did it. 

Boyd's son, Kenneth Smith, 35, who visited his dad every day for the last two weeks, said in an interview on Thursday that he felt the attention paid to the milestone had hurt his father's chances for clemency. Smith also said his dad was deeply troubled that he might only be remembered as a grim hash mark in the history books. "He didn't want to be 999, and he didn't want to be 1001 if you know what I mean," said Smith. "He wanted to live."
Belinda J. Foster, District Attorney for Rockingham, N.C., who prosecuted Boyd, said she felt confident that the death penalty was warranted in this case. "There are cases that are so horrendous and the evidence so strong it just warrants a death sentence," Ms. Foster said. Michael Paranzino, president of the pro-death penalty group Throw Away the Key, agreed. "You'll never stop crimes of passion, but I do believe the death penalty is a general deterrent, and it expresses society's outrage," Paranzino said.

"We believe this occasion is the perfect time to reconsider the whole issue of execution," said William F. Schulz, executive director of Amnesty International, a human rights group that has sought to end the practice of using executions as a punishment for crime around the world. "Since 1976, about one in eight prisoners on death row in the U.S. has been exonerated. That should raise serious questions about ending a person's life," Schulz said.

According to the non-governmental organization &lt;a href="w%3AAmnesty%20International"&gt;Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt;, the countries People's Republic of China, Iran and Vietnam are the only nations with more executions in 2004 than the United States. Thirty-eight of the 50 US states and the federal government permit capital punishment. An October 2005 Gallup poll found that 64 percent of all Americans support capital punishment in murder cases.

North Carolina executed two prisoners last month, as well as two others earlier in the year.

♡❤♡Debate over capital punishment♡❤♡

The grim milestone has prompted global outcry from human rights advocates. In a media statement the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; also condemned the execution, calling for the end of the death penalty worldwide. "We consider this punishment cruel and inhuman. It does not act as a deterrent and any miscarriage of justice - which is inevitable in any legal system - is irreversible." "It is a scandal that the death penalty still exists in a civilised country like the United States of America," said Petra Herrmann, chairwoman of the German group Alive e V.

Boyd's death rallied death penalty opponents, and about 150 protesters gathered outside the prison. After watching Boyd die, Rockingham County (N.C.) Sheriff Sam Page said the victims should be remembered. "Tonight, justice has been served for Mr. Kenneth Boyd. What I would ask you to do is not forget the victims of this crime," Page said. "Pray for them. Pray for them and their healing." 

"This is one small step for humankind - backwards," said veteran American campaigner &lt;a href="w%3AClive%20Stafford%20Smith"&gt;Clive Stafford Smith&lt;/a&gt; in an interview with Reuters. "The death penalty makes us all far more barbaric. I have watched a lot of people die, and when you come out from watching someone being executed it certainly isn't a better world."

According to Kenyan National Human Rights Commission Chairman Maina Kiai, "[It is] a great pity that the US can keep on executing people [when much of the developed world had already ended the death penalty]." "Also, the fact that in the US a lot of death sentences that are carried out invariably affect people of colour and poor people, it's an issue of great concern," Kiai said.

In Singapore, where a 25-year-old Australian was hanged just hours before Boyd's execution, Sinapan Samydorai, president of the think-tank Think Centre, said there was no justice without life. "The US is supposed to be a champion of human rights and democracy, yet they do not recognise the right to life," he said. Singapore has a mandatory death sentence for crimes such as murder, firearms offences and drug trafficking, and has hanged 420 people since 1991, mainly for drug trafficking. Singapore's death penalty is often believed to enjoy wide public support; although details remain obscure for political reasons.

In Japan, where the death penalty is also widely supported, Akiko Takada of anti-capital punishment group Forum 90 said despite frequent use of the death penalty in the United States, "crime there shows no signs of diminishing, so ultimately the death of these people has no effect."

&lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Hardie"&gt;James Hardie Industries&lt;/a&gt; has signed a final agreement designed to ensure that compensation will be received by victims who suffer health consequences due to their exposure to the company's asbestos products. The deal, signed on Thursday, is expected to cost the company $4.5 billion over the next 40 years, and James Hardie is obligated to pay 35 per cent of its free cash flow during each of those years to fund a compensation trust. 

The Australian corporate watchdog &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Securities%20and%20Investments%20Commission"&gt;ASIC (Australian Securities and Investments Commission)&lt;/a&gt; is gaining ground on James Hardie Industries corporate members. It is understood that the company's agreement with the NSW Government will not provide Hardie directors and executives with the immunities from civil prosecution sought by the company. The possible charges for the members range as high as jail terms of up to five years. 

According to ♡❤The Weekend Australian♡❤, a source said, "this arrangement suited ASIC because rather than channelling its efforts into cases that could provide compensation, it can concentrate on alleged offences that could result in criminal prosecution or banning officers from holding directorships or management positions." 
NSW Special Commissioner David Jackson QC said that former Hardie chief executive Peter Macdonald engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct when he told the stock exchange that the asbestos compensation trust Hardie set up in 2001 with $293 million would be "fully funded". At around the same time, James Hardie share holders voted for the relocation of its corporate base from Australia to the Netherlands.

Another alleged issue is a controversial $1.9 billion share cancellation, which a NSW MP said attracted ASIC to look at the activities of Hardie chairwoman Meredith Hellicar. 

The ASIC task force plan to collect and analyse documents and interview witnesses into at least the middle of next year. Until then, any possible new charges are unlikely.

U.S. military officials have now confirmed that the U.S. military has been paying Iraqi newspapers to publish positive news about U.S. efforts in Iraq. This confirms the report that the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20Times"&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ broke last week.

Earlier this year, the Bush administration came under criticism for distributing videos and news stories in the United States without identifying the federal government as its source, and paying American journalists to promote administration policies. The &lt;a href="w%3AGovernment%20Accountability%20Office"&gt;Government Accountability Office&lt;/a&gt; has characterized these practices as "covert &lt;a href="w%3Apropaganda"&gt;propaganda&lt;/a&gt;."

&lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Dakota"&gt;South Dakotans&lt;/a&gt; got more than a charity bash Saturday after a planned demolition of the tallest building in South Dakota, a feed plant tower, went badly. Experts will attempt to reprise their role on Monday, planting more explosives to topple the now leaning Zip Feed Mill tower of &lt;a href="w%3ASioux%20Falls%2C%20South%20Dakota"&gt;Sioux Falls&lt;/a&gt;, or perhaps finish it by smashing it down with a wrecking ball. 

Some would like to see the odd landmark stay in its 30 degree list as a tourist attraction. But few believe the partnership that owns it will stand for such a ruse. Most believe the tower is a major menace in its present half-demolished position. 

Tickets were sold for a dollar each to raise money for local charities, raising over $100,000. The massive concrete structure's ability to withstand the timed and computer designed blasting pattern was underestimated. 

The 202 foot tower was the tallest building in South Dakota, but may no longer be so due to its tilt.

The United States &lt;a href="w%3ATransportation%20Security%20Administration"&gt;Transportation Security Administration&lt;/a&gt; (TSA) announced Friday that it will relax proscriptions against certain carry-on items. Beginning December 22, travelers flying in the United States will be allowed to carry scissors less than four inches in length and screwdrivers less than seven inches in length.

The TSA hopes that by relaxing restrictions on scissors and screwdrivers, screeners will be able to more closely guard against items such as box cutters and bomb making materials. There have been no restrictions on items such as scissor and screwdrivers in checked luggage -- in fact, box cutters, ice axes/picks, knives, meat cleavers, razor-type blades, sabers, and swords can all be transported in checked baggage.

As part of a broader security realignment, TSA screeners will begin performing more random searches of carry-on bags, pat downs, and hand-wand searches of travelers.

"By incorporating unpredictability into our procedures and eliminating low-threat items, we can better focus our efforts on stopping individuals that wish to do us harm," TSA chief Kip Hawley said.

Flight attendants and pilots largely oppose the changes in permitted items -- they maintain that the changes undermine flight security.

The US commander of the Multinational Security Transition Command in Iraq said that he had no knowledge of the ♡❤National Strategy for Victory in Iraq♡❤ document released by the US President. This, along with speculation that the document was chiefly authored by a public opinion analyst recruited by the White House have led to some critics claiming that the drafted 'strategy' is targeting US public opinion, not the Iraqi insurgency.

The military, political and economic strategy for Iraq, outlined last week by President Bush in a speech at the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, was based by a 35-page document titled the ♡❤&lt;a href="http%3A//www.whitehouse.gov/infocus/iraq/iraq_strategy_nov2005.html"&gt;National Strategy for Victory in Iraq&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. A &lt;a href="w%3Ametadata"&gt;metadata&lt;/a&gt; tag on the document posted on the White House website identified its author as a computer user 'feaver_p'. It is believed to refer to &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20D.%20Feaver"&gt;Dr. Peter D. Feaver&lt;/a&gt;, a special advisor to the National Security Council staff.

A political scientist at Duke University, Dr. Feaver analyzed public opinion polls about the Iraq war and attitudes towards war casualties. Dr. Feaver found that US public opinion will support military engagement abroad, despite growing casualties, provided that the public believed that the war was being fought for a worthy cause and that victory was achievable.

Dr. Feaver was one of the people who helped "conceive and draft" the document, according to a White House staffer, who said that Meghan L. O'Sullivan, the deputy national security adviser for Iraq and Afghanistan, and her staff played a larger role. White House officials confirmed to the ♡❤New York Times♡❤ that the document's "creation and presentation strongly reflected the public opinion research". 

The document "reflects the broad interagency effort under way in Iraq" according to an NSC spokesman Frederick Jones and had received major contributions from the Departments of Defense, State, Treasury and Homeland Security, as well as the director of National Intelligence. 

On Friday, Lt. Gen. Martin Dempsey, whose Multinational Security Transition Command is responsible for building Iraq's security forces, told reporters that he had seen the strategy document for the first time when it was released to the public. The White House had said that not all senior officers in Iraq had necessarily seen the document and Gen. Peter Pace, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has said that he had read and critiqued the document on several occasions.

Earlier, replying to questions about the President's strategy, White House press secretary Scott McClellan said that the document was an "inter-agency document" and an "unclassified version" of the administrations "strategy for victory in Iraq" published for the public to view. 

Christopher F. Gelpi, of Duke University, who co-authored Dr. Feaver's work titled ♡❤Casualty Sensitivity and the War in Iraq,♡❤ stated, "The Pentagon doesn't need the president to give a speech and post a document on the White House Web site to know how to fight the insurgents. The document is clearly targeted at American public opinion." In their work together, Gelpi, Feaver and Reifler found that the most important factor which determines the US public's tolerance for US military deaths in a war is the public's ♡❤beliefs about the likelihood of success,♡❤ and a secondary, but still important, factor, was found to be the public's belief in the rightness of a war.

&lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt; daily newspaper ♡❤SABAH♡❤ reported that the leader of Ansar El Islam group (Soldiers of God) claimed that prior to the &lt;a href="NATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; summit in 2004 in &lt;a href="Istanbul"&gt;Istanbul&lt;/a&gt;, "he was interrogated by three foreigners and beaten."

On 29 April 2004, before the NATO Summit, which was to be held in June in Istanbul, Alpaslan Toprak, who is claimed to be the Turkish representative of Ansar El Islam, and 15 others were detained by the police after being given information by the &lt;a href="CIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt;. 

Toprak was separated from others in his group. He was blindfolded and interrogated in a secret location by four people, three of whom were speaking in English. He was beaten up and a gun was placed on his head. His allegations were included in his court statement, dated 12 May 2005.

According to the ♡❤SABAH♡❤, during the interrogation of Toprak, a CIA plane was in Turkey.

The CIA has not issued a statement about the specific claims.

A lone blogger has recently mailed a request for re-examination of the Amazon "One-Click" shopping patent to the US Patent Office. As prior art, he is using an early e-commerce patent and some information about DigiCash from sources such as the Wayback machine, which ironically uses data from Alexa (wholly owned by Amazon).

He is asking others to submit additional prior art and points out that there may be other prior art that can be found. He is also looking for donations to cover some of his costs such as the USD $2,520 reexamination fee.

&lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistani&lt;/a&gt; security forces have reportedly killed Abu Hamza Rabia, one of top five leaders in international islamic fundamentalist campaign &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, Pakistani forces tracked down Rabia and killed him in a rocket attack near the Pakistani-Afghan border.

Rabia was among five people who were killed in the blast on Thursday in &lt;a href="w%3AWaziristan%23North%20Waziristan"&gt;North Waziristan&lt;/a&gt;. According to official reports corroborated by Pakistani President General &lt;a href="w%3APervez%20Musharraf"&gt;Pervez Musharraf&lt;/a&gt;, the blast was set off as the victims were making explosives inside a suspected al-Qaeda hideout. An anonymous senior intelligence officer said that a missile attack triggered a massive explosion in a stockpile of bomb-making materials, grenades and other munitions.

Hamza Rabia is a key associate of &lt;a href="w%3AAyman%20al-Zawahiri"&gt;Ayman al-Zawahiri&lt;/a&gt;, a prominent figure in al-Qaeda. "After &lt;a href="w%3AOsama%20bin%20Laden"&gt;Osama bin Laden&lt;/a&gt; and Ayman al-Zawahri, Rabia was the most senior al Qaeda official for international terrorism planning," a US counteterrorism official said. According to officials, Rabia ranks somewhere between third and fifth in the organization's hierarchy. He is believed to have become the network's operational commander after the capture of Abu Farraj al-Libbi in Pakistan in May.

Intelligence officials said that Rabia was the target of the attack due to his alleged involvement in terror attacks and killings of government officials. He was brought to Miran Shah, a strategic tribal region where remaining al-Qaeda members are believed to have been hiding, by al-Zawahri, who is believed to have been on the run along the border. Officials, however, say that they have no idea on the whereabouts of al-Zawahri or Osama bin Laden.

Bodies of Rabia and two other foreigners were retreived and buried by associates from outside Pakistan, according to Pakistan's English-language Dawn newspaper.

Amr Shabana and Nicol David won the men's and women's World &lt;a href="w%3ASquash%20%28sport%29"&gt;Squash&lt;/a&gt; Open's respectively, today, in &lt;a href="w%3AHong%20Kong"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt;. It was Shabana's second World Title in three years, as the &lt;a href="w%3AEgypt"&gt;Egyptian&lt;/a&gt; also won in 2003. It was David's first time winning the biggest tournament in the world. 

Shabana beat Australian David Palmer 11/6,11/7,11/8 in 40 minutes. Shabana is currently ranked number 5 in the world, and will likely move into the top 3 next month, as neither the World #1 (Theirry Lincou), or number 2 (James Willstrop) reached the final.

David, who is from &lt;a href="w%3AMalaysia"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;, secured the #1 spot in next month's rankings by reaching the final. David defeated Number 1 seed Rachel Grinham, of Australia 8/10,9/2,9/6,9/7 in 53 minutes, to take the title.

<h2>G7 keeps pressure on China over currency</h2>

Financial ministers and central bank governors from the G7 countries are pressuring China to make it's exchange rate more flexible. "We expect that further flexible implementation of China's currency system would improve the functioning and stability of the global economy and the international monetary system," they said in a written statement. Separately US Treasury Secretary John Snow said "China's new exchange rate system has operated with too " He remarked "This rigidity constrains exchange rate flexibility in the region and thus poses risks to China's economy and the global economy."

Iran's nuclear issue is heating up as United States and Britain try to persuade Russia and China to accept the authenticity of the evidence found in "The Laptop" given to the U.S. nuclear experts showing Iran's detailed plans for building a nuclear bomb.

The Islamic Republic's long time main opposition group Mujahedin-e-Khalq, a.k.a. (PMOI), has been bringing the nuclear issue to the world's attention.

In a press conference in Washington, in August 2002, the Mujahedin-e-Khalq revealed Iran's secret nuclear plan for the first time shocking the western intelligence communities.

Three years since then, new evidence emerging each month has created more suspicions about what Iran claims to be a peaceful project for civilian use.

Driven by increasing pressure from the European allies who have backed down from talks, the Islamic republic has hyped up their global campaign to discredit the Mujahedin-e-Khalq. Some policy makers who offered to put the Iranian opposition in the list of terrorist organizations now repent from their past policy. The PMOI has been officially designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation by the United States and is proscribed by the European Union.

The National Council of Resistance to Iran quoted Lord Alton of Liverpool, a lawmaker from the British House of Lords, as saying on November 29 in a symposium in the House of Lords, "Having been involved with the activities of the Iranian Resistance over this 25 years, I have learned a great deal about that misinformation campaign and the attempts by the Iranian regime to discredit the PMOI."

The new campaign has concerned Iranian dissidents abroad. An outspoken former national soccer champion, Mr. Hassan Naeb Agha, an active member of the opposition, claims to have been approached by family members under influence of Iran Ministry of Intelligence (MOIS) in a psychological warfare in an attempt to penetrate his personal life to stop his activities.

John Pace, &lt;a href="w%3Ahuman%20rights"&gt;human rights&lt;/a&gt; chief for the United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq (UNAMI), condemned both the US-installed Iraqi government and the US Armed Forces for breach of human rights, centring largely around widespread &lt;a href="w%3Ahabeas%20corpus"&gt;detention without authority or trial&lt;/a&gt;.

"There is no question that terrorism has to be addressed. But we are equally sure that the remedies being applied... are not the best way of eliminating terrorism," Pace said during an interview on Sunday. 

He quoted instances where Iraqi judges had ordered the release of groups of prisoners, and had found not only that their orders had been refused, but found themselves locked up as a reprisal.

On the subject of the &lt;a href="w%3ASaddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt; trial resuming Monday, Pace told ♡❤Reuters♡❤, "Weakness in the system of administration of justice, in addition to the antecedents surrounding the establishment of this tribunal, will never be able to produce the kind of process that would be able to satisfy international standards." 

He also pointed out that the Iraqi authorities are the only legal entity allowed to detain prisoners, and that the US prison camps at &lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Ghraib%20prison"&gt;Abu Ghraib&lt;/a&gt; and similar locations are therefore technically illegal.

<h2>EU too quick to introduce new rules, UK study says</h2>

A UK government sponsored report, Routes to Better Regulation - A Guide to Alternatives to Classic Regulation, says the EU is too quick to introduce new rules without considering alternative measures. "All too often the EU looks to introduce prescriptive rules and regulations rather than consider alternative solutions, which can achieve the same goals and help to slash costly red tape," said David Arculus, chairman of the task force that compiled the report. The EU Commission, under president Jose Manuel Barroso has insisted on impact studies before deciding on whether to propose legislation. The Commission announced it will kill off several legislative proposals that have failed to make progress, and is proposing streamlining existing EU rules. The study proposed taking no action instead of introducing new rules. In January, the task force will become an independent commission, which will increase its political strength.

<h2>JPMorgan plans to offshore 30% of its back office</h2>

JPMorgan is planning to hire 4,500 graduates in India over two years. The plan moves 30% of its back office offshore. The company intends to move the majority of its foreign exchange trades to Mumbai and Bangalore and to move much of the processing of credit derivatives contracts. This is an area where US and UK regulators have expressed concern about backlogs across the industry.

While this wasn't ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AInterview%20with%20the%20Vampire"&gt;Interview with the Vampire&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, getting a live interview with &lt;a href="w%3AJimmy%20Wales"&gt;Jimmy Wales&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AWikimedia%20Foundation"&gt;Wikimedia Foundation&lt;/a&gt; is requiring more work and planning than ever. Four contributors to four different Wikinews language editions (with , , and ) arranged to interview "Jimbo" in the Wikinews IRC channel, squeezed in before interviews with a periodical and a cable news source.

<h2>Wikinews</h2>

The interview was held publically in the &lt;a href="irc%3A//irc.freenode.net/wikinews"&gt;Wikinews IRC channel&lt;/a&gt; because was one of the prime topics for the interview. 

Wikinews is approximately one year old, with the English and German editions premiering the first week of December 2004. Since then the project has produced more than 13,000 articles in 16 languages, including the recently added Hebrew, Russian, and Japanese.

The project has not been without its detractors, and the questions asked of Mr. Wales reflected some of the most common criticisms.

<dl>
BULLET::::- &lt;u&gt;Wikinews:&lt;/u&gt; Wikinews seems primarily dedicated to regurgitating what is already being published on main stream media news sources. Was this the vision for Wikinews?

</dl>

<dl>
BULLET::::- The wiki movements seem focused on local expertise; people work on things they are interested and expert in. Why is there very little local news on Wikinews, which it seems like it would be best qualified to produce?

</dl>

<dl>
BULLET::::- Do you believe that Wikinews, or any of the Wiki projects qualify as a &lt;a href="w%3Ameritocracy"&gt;meritocracy&lt;/a&gt;?

</dl>

<dl>
BULLET::::- "Current Events" is not "encyclopedic" enough to reside on Wikipedia! On many Wikipedia projects content have been moved to Wikibooks and Wikisource, shouldn't "Current Events" be transferred to Wikinews in the same way?

BULLET::::- All Wikimedia Foundation projects currently use the &lt;a href="w%3Afree%20software"&gt;free&lt;/a&gt; software, which was purposely-designed for the &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; project. Which makes it an excellent tool for an online community-developed encyclopedia, but perhaps not so perfect for other forms of knowledge bases like or Wikinews. For Wikinews, an important tool was the creation of , an extension to the software which allows lists of current articles to be built dynamically when they are published so the latest news is on the main page.

BULLET::::- When Wikinews was started a year ago, a need for new functions quickly appeared. Dynamic Page Lists are crucial to Wikinews and several other tools should be developed as they are asked for. The situation is similar on other projects (e.g. Wiktionary), maybe a plan for developing a project specific software package should precede the creation of new projects?

<h2>Wikimedia Foundation fund drive</h2>

The Wikimedia Foundation has turned to its constituency to cover basic operating costs as well as the ongoing capital expenditures which seem to grow at the same rate as Wikipedia's popularity: exponentially. From the first fundraiser in December/January of 2003/2004 (which raised about &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Dollar"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;30,000 after a server catastrophe) to the Fall Quarter fundraiser in 2005 (which raised $244,000), each fund raiser has met the goals laid out for it, usually in a very brief time frame.

"We wish to cover two quarters," said Florence Nibart-Devouard, member of the Wikimedia Foundation Board.

The draft budget for just the first quarter of 2006 is projecting costs of more than $400,000; and projections put the year's expenditures near $3.2 million over all. But beyond the general goal of covering the budgets for two quarters, the foundation has not placed a specific financial goal for their upcoming fund raiser.

<h2>Follow-on questions</h2>

As the interview progressed, with more and more observers, we got to that point where we really wanted to dig deeper into certain aspects of answers to our questions, but were short on time. Then it turned into a classic press conference, with interviewers tossing out questions rapid fire and Mr. Wales answering quickly and briefly to as many as he could... with all of us wishing we had more time to get more details and explanations.

Cases of the H5 type of the &lt;a href="w%3AAvian%20influenza"&gt;avian flu&lt;/a&gt; have been discovered in &lt;a href="w%3ARomania"&gt;Romanian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AUkraine"&gt;Ukrainian&lt;/a&gt; fowl. Romania has banned hunting in parts of the country and Ukrainian troops have moved from house to house in villages rounding up chickens, ducks and geese for a mass cull.

The village of Ciocile in the Romanian county of &lt;a href="w%3ABr%C4%83ila%20County"&gt;Brăila&lt;/a&gt; has been quarantined and thousands of birds have been killed in an attempt to contain the outbreak, the Bucharest Daily News reported. The H5 virus had been detected in nearby villages of Bumbacari and Dudescu in previous tests on Thursday.

Romanian Agriculture Minister Gheorghe Flutur said that further tests in a British laboratory will be needed to determine whether the outbreak is the lethal &lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt; strain, which is feared to be able to mutate into a form that would be easily transmitted between humans.

The H5N1 strain has already been confirmed in the villages of Ceamurlia de Jos, Maliuc and Caraorman, where the virus is suspected to have been brought by birds from Russia. The large &lt;a href="w%3ARiver%20delta"&gt;delta&lt;/a&gt; area is a destination for migrating fowl.

Meanwhile, five Ukrainian villages in the &lt;a href="w%3ACrimean%20peninsula"&gt;Crimean peninsula&lt;/a&gt; have been the site for a mass cull in order to contain the country's first bird flu outbreak. Though tough measures are being taken in the area, villagers say their poultry had been infected by the disease for more than two months without any official action being taken.

Ukrainian Agriculture Minister Oleksander Baranivsky confirmed the virus as the H5 subtype on Saturday. He said that the virus was highly lethal to birds and potentially dangerous to humans. According to official data, more than 2,500 birds had died since Friday. Samples were sent to British and Italian laboratories to determine whether the virus is the H5N1 strain.

Though Ukraine had previously been declared free of bird flu, the H5N1 virus strain had been found near its borders in Romania and Russia. Ukraine's top veterinary surgeon, Petro Verbytsky, however stressed that no humans had been affected by the virus, and that contagion was unlikely. "There is 1,000 times less chance of becoming ill from bird flu than there is from &lt;a href="w%3ATuberculosis"&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/a&gt;," he said.

The H5N1 strain of the avian influenza has killed almost 70 people in parts of Asia since 2003, prompting the slaughter of millions of fowl.

Facing a threatened boycott from the , pulled its advertising from gay publications early this week. The (AFA) quickly claimed a cultural victory after Ford made the decision. The AFA was threatening to boycott Ford because of its previous support for certain gay civil rights associations, such as the Human Rights Campaign, and advertising in the gay media in publications such as ♡❤♡❤.

In June, the AFA announced that it would postpone a boycott when Ford agreed to negotiate with the organization. The negotiations were organized by Ford Executives &lt;a href="w%3AZiad%20Ojakli"&gt;Ziad Ojakli&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Leitch"&gt;David Leitch&lt;/a&gt;, both of whom previously held important posts in the Bush White House.

"They've heard our concerns; they are acting on our concerns. We are pleased with where we are," said AFA’s chairman Donald Wildmon. "Obviously there are still some small matters of difference, as people will always have, but generally speaking, we are pleased with the results—and therefore the boycott that had been suspended [is] now officially ended."

According to the AFA’s Web site, the list of demands included that Ford and all of its brands stop donating money, merchandise, and endorsements to pride celebrations and groups such as the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, the Human Rights Campaign, and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. HRC, GLAAD, and the Task Force are expected to release statements by close of business on Friday. 

The AFA ended in May what is considered a largely ineffective nine-year boycott of &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Walt%20Disney%20Co."&gt;The Walt Disney Co.&lt;/a&gt; The boycott had been launched over its holding of gay-related events at its theme parks and for giving employees with same-sex domestic partners benefits equal to those with other-sex partners.

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State"&gt;Secretary of State&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="Condoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; has begun to address concerns raised by the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;EU&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACouncil%20of%20Europe"&gt;Council of Europe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and several member countries about the &lt;a href="CIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt;'s detention practices upon her arrival in &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; for a European tour that began Tuesday.

"As a matter of US policy, the United States' obligations under the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Convention%20Against%20Torture"&gt;U.N. Convention Against Torture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which prohibits, of course, cruel and inhumane and degrading treatment, those obligations extend to US personnel wherever they are, whether they are in the United States or outside the United States," said Rice, speaking from the &lt;a href="Ukraine"&gt;Ukrainian&lt;/a&gt; capital of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKiev"&gt;Kiev&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on Wednesday.

Media reports and Human Rights groups have alleged that the CIA transported &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Arendition"&gt;renditioned&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; prisoners through European countries, which could violate &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union%20law"&gt;European laws&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the sovereignty of countries involved. Secretary Rice claimed that the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; has respected the sovereignty of other countries, and that it has not transported detainees from one country to another for the purpose of interrogation using torture, and has not transported anyone to a country when we believe he will be tortured.

"We consider the captured members of &lt;a href="Al-Qaeda"&gt;Al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; and its affiliates to be &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnlawful%20combatant"&gt;unlawful combatants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; who may be held, in accordance with the law of war, to keep them from killing innocents. We must treat them in accordance with our laws, which reflect the values of the American people. We must question them to gather potentially significant, life-saving, intelligence. We must bring terrorists to justice wherever possible," Rice told reporters before she left from Andrews Air Force base on Monday.

Rice said that European nations should realize that interrogations of terrorist suspects have produced information that has saved European lives. However, Secretary Rice provided no specific cases.
"Secretary Rice made extra-legal rendition sound like just another form of extradition. In fact, it's a form of kidnapping and 'disappearing' someone entirely outside the law," said Tom Malinowski, a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHuman%20Rights%20Watch"&gt;Human Rights Watch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; official in Washington.

The CIA practice known as "extraordinary rendition" is used to interrogate terrorist suspects outside the U.S., where they are not subject to American legal protection. 

"Kidnapping a foreign national for the purpose of detaining and interrogating him outside the law is contrary to American values," said Anthony D. Romero, executive director of the &lt;a href="American%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union"&gt;American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKhalid%20El-Masri"&gt;Khalid El-Masri&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; case. "Our government has acted as if it is above the law. We go to court today to reaffirm that the rule of law is central to our identity as a nation." 

The ACLU feels the government has to be held to account over "extraordinary rendition".

Two mass graves discovered in &lt;a href="w%3ALebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; near a former &lt;a href="w%3ASyria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;n intelligence center in &lt;a href="w%3AAnjar%2C%20Lebanon"&gt;Anjar&lt;/a&gt; have reopened the investigations for persons missing from the &lt;a href="w%3ALebanese%20Civil%20War"&gt;Lebanese civil war&lt;/a&gt; (1975 – 1990).

Lebanese officials have announced DNA samples of the remains found will be tested.

Troops unearthed at least 30 bodies buried in the 1980s and 1990s.

Syrian troops withdrew from Lebanon last spring, ending a 30-year occupation. Prior to his assassination, &lt;a href="w%3AGebran%20Tueni"&gt;Gebran Tueni&lt;/a&gt; commented that "the Syrian regime has been exposed with the discovery of the mass graves."

Amnesty International has been critical of the exhumation, calling for UN standards of investigation.

Authorities have confirmed 128 dead following a plane crash in &lt;a href="w%3ATehran"&gt;Tehran&lt;/a&gt;. The Iranian Air Force &lt;a href="w%3AC-130%20Hercules"&gt;C-130&lt;/a&gt; military transport plane collided with a 10-storey apartment building, while attempting to make an emergency landing.

The air force airliner crashed at approximately 14:10 local time (10:40 UTC) nearing the runway in &lt;a href="w%3AMehrabad%20International%20Airport"&gt;Mehrabad International Airport&lt;/a&gt; for an emergency landing because of an engine malfunction eight minutes after the initial take-off, killing all 94 people aboard and sparking fires in the apartment building that houses about 250 people consisting of military personnel and their families. 34 people has been killed from the residents and 132 injured. Most of the airplane passengers were Iranian radio and television journalists. 

The victims have been recovered to nearby hospitals in &lt;a href="w%3ATowhid"&gt;Towhid&lt;/a&gt; residential area in southern Tehran.

<h1>Australian Government passes new terror laws</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Australian%20Government%20passes%20new%20terror%20laws&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Government%20of%20Australia"&gt;Australia Federal Government&lt;/a&gt; has passed wide-ranging new counter-terrorism laws that civil opponents warned will disintegrate civil liberties. The federal parliament has agreed to laws aimed at stifling home-grown terrorists. The terrorism legislation was rushed through the Senate yesterday evening after the Government gagged debate on the bill. 

The new laws enable police and intelligence agencies to detain suspects without charge for up to 14 days in solitary confinement. Authorities can also restrict and control movements of suspects, including fitting them with electronic tags for up to 12 months. 

&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;Prime Minister John Howard&lt;/a&gt; introduced the package after the &lt;a href="w%3AJuly%202005%20London%20bombings"&gt;July 2005 bombings in London&lt;/a&gt;. Federal Justice Minister Chris Ellison told the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; the laws would give authorities the necessary tools to tackle terrorism, while being consistent with international human rights obligations.

John North, president of the Law Council of Australia, an outspoken critic of the package, said lawyers would monitor the government's use of its new powers. "We want governments to know that almost 50,000 lawyers will be watching closely to make sure the new laws are not implemented at the expense of our civil liberties," Mr North said. He also said in a letter addressed to Prime Minister John Howard that "The legal profession believes that the ramifications of these laws have the potential to be as terrifying as terrorism itself." This following a media campaign launched by the Law Council in newspapers vilifying the new legislation as "draconian".

The package, broadly supported by the opposition &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Labor Party&lt;/a&gt;, gives police tougher powers to stop, search and seize evidence from suspects and enables more close circuit television cameras to be used to monitor public places. The new legislation also updates and allow greater use of security cameras.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Greens"&gt;Australian Greens&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Democrats"&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt; and the Law Council accuse the Labor Party of selling out civil rights by supporting the bill, which will give unprecedented powers to police and spy agencies. &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Brown"&gt;Australian Greens leader Bob Brown&lt;/a&gt; condemned the laws. "We are in a new period of &lt;a href="w%3AMccarthyism"&gt;McCarthyism&lt;/a&gt; and we need to know that, and understand it, and worry that this time it won't be turned around, that citizens, using a law like this, will be brought before courts for political reasons, not security reasons," he told parliament.

Following some amendments, the &lt;a href="w%3AOmbudsman"&gt;Commonwealth Ombudsman&lt;/a&gt; will be given more power to oversee detention, detainees will have greater access to relatives and police will need to satisfy a greater number of grounds to impose limits on who a suspect can contact. The Australian Law Reform Commission will review the sedition provisions next year.

Civil libertarians and people who oppose &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20contribution%20to%20the%202003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq"&gt;Australia's involvement in Iraq&lt;/a&gt; also have protested. The proposed laws are "horrific for journalists," senior &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Fairfax%20Holdings"&gt;Fairfax&lt;/a&gt; journalist &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Marr%20journalist"&gt;David Marr&lt;/a&gt; said. "Firstly, there's a completely secret new regime of putting people in preventive detention — that's entirely secret," he said. "If we report it, if we report that people have gone into preventive detention, we're going to go individually to jail for five to seven years, something like that. Even if we report what happened to people in detention, we go to jail. "

&lt;a href="w%3AHuman%20Rights%20and%20Equal%20Opportunity%20Commission"&gt;Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission&lt;/a&gt; president John Von Doussa says the proposed counter-terrorism laws are the first step towards a police state. The legislation gives police extraordinary powers to detain people without charge, but does not set out means by which the application of those powers can be checked or appealed, he said. 

Prime Minister John Howard rejects suggestions the Government acted in undue haste by pushing a range of striking new laws through parliament before Christmas, despite public outcry over inadequate scrutiny and the gagging of parliamentary debate on many of the bills. 

&lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Hill%20%28Australian%20politician%29"&gt;Defence Minister, Senator Robert Hill&lt;/a&gt; says the government has a responsibility to protect Australians. "Out of the British bombing, we went back and looked at our laws. We believed that we needed further powers to protect Australians, said Mr Hill. "Obviously, we want to put them through as quickly as possible because we are addressing a terrorist threat."

&lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Mirecki"&gt;Professor Paul Mirecki&lt;/a&gt;, the chairman of the Religious Studies Department at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Kansas"&gt;University of Kansas&lt;/a&gt;, was hospitalized after being assaulted by two unidentified men who made references to the class he had planned to teach in the spring. The course, entitled "Special Topics in Religion: Intelligent Design, Creationism and other Religious Mythologies" was intended to support evolution, and explore creationism as a mythology.

Professor Mirecki had left his home and was driving to breakfast when he noticed the men tailgating him in a pickup truck. He said, "I just pulled over hoping they would pass, and then they pulled up real close behind." "They got out, and I made the mistake of getting out."

&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Calvert"&gt;John Calvert&lt;/a&gt;, managing director of the Intelligent Design Network, had previously objected to Professor Mirecki's focus on creationism as mythology, and claimed that the religious studies professor was "labeling anybody who proposes [intelligent design] to be simply a religious nut".

Paul Mirecki had already decided to cancel the course after he caused controversy by using the slang term "fundies" to refer to Christian Fundamentalists in an email to a student organization, the Society for Open Minded Atheists and Agnostics. Professor Mirecki has apologized for using the term, which is viewed as a slur by some conservatives.

As the trial of &lt;a href="w%3ASaddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt; drew another day of testimony, the court heard the testimony of five witnesses of the killing of 140 men in &lt;a href="w%3ADujail"&gt;Dujail&lt;/a&gt;, a town north of &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;. 

Witnesses who feared showing their face or voice were allowed to testify in a covered box with their voice altered. Their names were also protected and each witness was named with a letter. The defense was, however, allowed to know the name of the witnesses as long as those names were not disclosed outside the proceedings.

Tuesday's court session lasted around nine hours.

&lt;a href="w%3AStevie%20Wonder"&gt;Stevie Wonder&lt;/a&gt; is slated to perform the pre-game show for &lt;a href="w%3ASuper%20Bowl"&gt;Super Bowl&lt;/a&gt; XL on February 5, 2006. This announcement was not made by the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Football%20League"&gt;NFL&lt;/a&gt;, but by Wonder's record label, &lt;a href="w%3AMotown"&gt;Motown&lt;/a&gt;.

Detroit, where Super Bowl 40 is being held, is the original home of Motown, and many of its residents were upset that England's &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Rolling%20Stones"&gt;Rolling Stones&lt;/a&gt; would be performing the prestigious half-time show.

His Highness Prince &lt;a href="w%3AKarim%20Aga%20Khan"&gt;Karim Aga Khan IV&lt;/a&gt;, Spiritual leader of Isma’illi Muslim community, is on an official visit to &lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;. The objective of his visit is to show coordination with the relief efforts and condolence for the victims of the massive earthquake that struck Pakistan on October 8, which is reported to have killed over 70,000 people and left millions homeless.

HH Aga Khan addressed earthquake survivors at the Thuri camp, reassuring them of the ongoing support from the Aga Khan Foundation Network including helicopters, and of support for reconstruction.

The Prince announced a $50.3 million donation for quake relief at the Islamabad donors conference.

A German man, Khaled al-Masri, has filed a lawsuit against the &lt;a href="CIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; for alleged torture when he was held prisoner for five months in &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; last year. He was arrested in 2004 in connection with the September 11 attacks when he was stopped in &lt;a href="Republic%20of%20Macedonia"&gt;Macedonia&lt;/a&gt;. After being arrested, he was flown to Afghanistan for questioning.

Masri said his cell in Afghanistan was cold, dirty and in a cellar, with no light and one dirty cover for warmth. The first night he said he was kicked and beaten and warned by an interrogator: "You are here in a country where no one knows about you, in a country where there is no law. If you die, we will bury you, and no one will know."

The &lt;a href="ACLU"&gt;American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)&lt;/a&gt; is representing Mr. al-Masri in the lawsuit filed on Tuesday in &lt;a href="Alexandria%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Alexandria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Virginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; seeking damages of at least $75,000. The main defendant is former CIA director &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Tenet"&gt;George Tenet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

&lt;a href="Condoleezza%20Rice"&gt;U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; was in &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; and would not comment on the lawsuit but the new &lt;a href="Angela%20Merkel"&gt;German Chancellor Angela Merkel&lt;/a&gt; said, "I'm happy to say we have discussed the one case, which the government of the United States has of course accepted as a mistake..."

A senior U.S. official accompanying Condoleezza Rice to &lt;a href="Romania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; said that Rice had not admitted to any mistakes in the handling of Masri. "We are not quite sure what was in her head," he said, referring to Merkel.

<h2>Verizon overhauling employee pension plans</h2>

Verizon announced Monday that it will stop making contributions to the pension plans of non-union managers and will instead offer 401(k) plans starting in 2006. The plan is intended to cut labor costs and will effect 50,000 management employees. Verizon hopes the change will save $3 billion over the next 10 years.

Australian researchers say they have scientifically proven that stress causes sickness. The Garvan Institute in Sydney has discovered that a hormone, known as neuropeptide Y, (NPY) is released into the body during times of stress. Their findings show the hormone can stop the immune system from functioning properly. 

"&lt;a href="w%3ANeuropeptide%20Y"&gt;Neuropeptide Y&lt;/a&gt; is one of those hormones that gets unregulated or released from neurones when stressful situations occur...it's known for example that it regulates blood pressure and heart rates so your heart rate goes up but it hasn't been known that it actually can affect immune cells as well," said Professor Herbert Herzog, one of the researchers.

Herzog feels it is good to finally have proof of something people have suspected for so long. 

"Now we have proven without doubt that there is a direct link and that stress can weaken the immune system and that makes you more vulnerable when you for example have a cold or flu and even in the more serious situations such as cancer can be enhanced in these situations," said Herzog.

The Garvan Institute study centres on two key events that enable the human body to recognise foreign substances and control invaders. When our body encounters a pathogen (bacteria and viruses), the immune cells retain and interrogate suspects. Their activation is made possible by NPY. These cells then return to the lymph nodes, which are found all over the body, with information about the foreign invaders. The lymph nodes are where decisions about defence are made.

"Most of us expect to come down with a cold or other illness when we are under pressure, but until now we have mostly had circumstantial evidence for a link between the brain and the immune system," said lead Garvan researcher, associate Professor Fabienne Mackay. "During periods of stress, nerves release a lot of NPY and it gets into the bloodstream, where it directly impacts on the cells in the immune system that look out for and destroy pathogens (bacteria and viruses) in the body."

In the case of bacteria and viruses, TH1 cells are part of the attack team that is sent out on the ‘search and destroy' mission. But when their job is done they need to be turned ‘off' and the immune system reset. The same hormone, NPY, that activates the sentry cells now prompts the TH1 cells to slow down and die.

"Under normal conditions, circulating immune cells produce small amounts of NPY, which enables the immune cells on sentry duty and the TH1 immune cells to operate - it's a yin and yang kind of situation. But too much NPY means that the TH1 attack is prevented despite the foreign invaders being identified - and this is what happens during stress,” added McKay.

The impact of stress on the body has been observed in athletes. Ph. D researcher at the University of Queensland, Luke Spence, together with the Australian Institute of Sport, studied elite and recreational athletes over five months.

They found elite athletes were more susceptible to respiratory diseases under stress. 

"A lot of elite athletes put themselves through vast amounts of physical stress in their training, but also their emotional, psychological stress of feeling the pressure of Australia on their shoulders, wanting to compete and wanting to do their best," said Spence.

It's not just athletes who are prone to stress. Pressures at work and at home may cause emotional and mental stress that can be equally damaging. Almost a third of all work absenteeism in Australia is due to illness, costing employers over $10 billion a year.

"I think it has a huge impact for the work force and also for employers - if their employees are constantly stressed, constantly under pressure, they are more likely to get sick," Spence said.

Further research could lead to the development of new drugs which may inhibit the action of the neuropeptide Y hormone. 

Herzog warns people to minimise stress ♡❤before♡❤ it becomes a problem. 

"Relaxation methods like yoga will help you to prevent that but there will still be people out there that are not responding to that and treatment by interfering with the system will be important," he said. "There's obviously some time until such a treatment will be available but this is something we will definitely work towards."

The Garvan research will be published in the Journal of Experimental Medicine, Volume 202, No. 11.

A new advertising campaign in &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href="w%3ASony"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt; PSP which looks like &lt;a href="w%3Agraffiti"&gt;graffiti&lt;/a&gt; and is often sprayed on previously vandalized walls has come under attack from other graffiti artists. A collective group of graffiti artists and street artists are now banding together, vandalizing the look-alike graffiti advertisements. The campaign has offended a lot of graffiti artists and street artists, drawing responses like "keep your desperate corporate long arm out of a movement that is the only thing that is ours!"

But not all the responses have been negative, with many artists defending Sony saying they have the right. Other &lt;a href="w%3Aadvertising"&gt;advertising&lt;/a&gt; companies have also voiced their support. "Sony and PSP have every right to use this type of &lt;a href="w%3Amass%20media"&gt;media&lt;/a&gt;," Floyd Hayes, the head creative director at Cunning Work told Wired News. "They have done it for (a) very long time very successfully and spoke the language of the streets without being patronizing." 
Sony says it is paying the building owners like Casa Maria for the right to advertise on their walls. Casa Maria was paid $100 for two weeks' use of its wall, co-owner Mario Arana told Wired News. Tats Cru, the graffiti crew responsible for the designs, have also been targeted with insulting slogans on Sony's advertisements.

&lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Korea"&gt;South Korean&lt;/a&gt; antitrust regulators fined the &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; company 33 billion Won (US$32m). It also ordered Microsoft to make substantial changes to the &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20Windows"&gt;Windows operating system&lt;/a&gt;. Regulators demanded that Microsoft produce two different versions of Microsoft Windows within 180 days.

<ul>
BULLET::::- One version must be stripped of the Windows Media Player and instant messenger software.
BULLET::::- The other version must come with links to Web pages that allow consumers to download competing versions of such software, the commission said.

</ul>
These regulations will be in effect for the next ten years, but after five years Microsoft can request a review of the market.

A Microsoft spokesman said the company would appeal the decision in court.

"We are very disappointed with the commission's decision," said Tom Burt, a Microsoft vice president and deputy general counsel. "Ultimately, we will file a lawsuit in Korean court challenging the decision."

Similarily in March of last year, Microsoft was ordered by the &lt;a href="w%3AEU"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; to pay €497 million for antitrust violations. Microsoft was also asked to share Windows operating system code with other companies and offer Windows without the media player.

Microsoft is also appealing this ruling.

♡❤♡UPDATE: &lt;a href="http%3A//perth.indymedia.org/index.php%3Faction%3Dnewswire%26amp%3Bparentview%3D14915%2314964"&gt;Chinese Asylum Seeker Ends Hunger Strike After 54 Days.&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡
A Chinese man in Australian immigration detention is still refusing food, seven weeks after starting his &lt;a href="w%3AHunger%20strike"&gt;hunger strike&lt;/a&gt;.

Jen Wen Zhang, a detainee at Sydney's &lt;a href="w%3AVillawood%20Immigration%20Detention%20Centre"&gt;Villawood Immigration Detention Centre&lt;/a&gt;, has refused food since October 20. Mr Zhang and five other Chinese asylum seekers began the strike in protest at Australia's &lt;a href="w%3AMandatory%20detention%20in%20Australia"&gt;Mandatory Detention policy&lt;/a&gt;. Five of the six hunger strikers ended their protest in November.

The &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Immigration%20and%20Multicultural%20and%20Indigenous%20Affairs"&gt;Department of Immigration (DIMIA)&lt;/a&gt; says Mr Zhang is continuing his hunger strike after being hospitalised a fortnight ago. Now back in Villawood he is being closely monitored. A DIMMIA spokesperson said Mr Zhang was being urged to end his strike. The government continues to resist Mr Zhang's protest. "As the minister said, his actions will not influence his migration status or outcomes," said the spokesperson.

&lt;a href="w%3AVictorian%20Greens"&gt;Victorian Greens&lt;/a&gt; refugees spokesman, Peter Job, has been speaking to Mr Zhang, and said the asylum seeker is determined to continue to strike despite his ailing health. Mr Job said Mr Zhang believes he was denied a fair hearing from the Immigration Department and the Refugee Review Tribunal, but was taking political action for all detained asylum seekers.

"He felt he had no option but to fight in the only way he could, with his body," said Mr Job. "But above all, he spoke of his dread of long-term detention, telling of waking continually in the morning with a sense of profound despair and foreboding due to his incarceration, and telling me he feared the mental health damage he had seen in so many long-term detainees," he said.

Mr Job says he has tried to convince Mr Zhang to stop the hunger strike, but says he is in a desperate state. "He is very upset, he feels that he will be in great danger if he returns to China," Mr Job said. "He said he'd rather die here in Australia than go back to China, where he's convinced he'll be persecuted.

Refugee Action Coalition (RAC) spokesman Ian Rintoul said the Immigration Department has been riddled with problems and too often rejected long-term detainees who are genuine refugees.

"The government itself has recognised there have been many mistakes in the department's processes, there have been many problems with the way asylum seekers have been dealt with," Mr Rintoul said. "That's why we're desperately trying to urge the government to intervene in this particular case."

Immigration Minister &lt;a href="w%3AAmanda%20Vanstone"&gt;Amanda Vanstone&lt;/a&gt; said in mid November that the Government has done all it can for the Chinese asylum seeker. "I don't support this kind of protest, I don't think anyone does, I recognise the risk it can play for the protesters themselves," she said. "I've written to them urging them to get off their protest and making it clear to them that the Government doesn't consider cases while people are engaging in this sort of potentially very harmful protest."

Another Villawood detainee, Motahar Hussein, says Mr Zheng's health has drastically deteriorated and suspects that vital organs have experienced permanent damage. 

"Though DIMIA continuously attempts to devise creative ways of crushing Mr. Jun Wen Zhang's spirit, he will not be easily intimidated," said Mr Hussein in a media release. "He is willing and determined to continue with his peaceful and civilised protest. He believes he has no other option. He finds himself compelled to do so by the Howard Government's policy of inhumane and indefinite detention. He is prepared to continue to the supreme and utmost sacrifice of his own life, hopefully, in an attempt to expose DIMIA's attitude of injustice and corruption."

A &lt;a href="Chicago"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt; owner of an &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AXbox%20360"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; console is filing a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aclass%20action"&gt;class action lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; against &lt;a href="Microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, the company that manufactured the console. The lawsuit is based on the widely circulated claims that the console overheats, resulting in complete lockups of the system or various error messages. 

Robert Bryers, the man who has brought this lawsuit against Microsoft, claims that the company rushed the console to market to beat competitor releases. He further claims that this rushed release resulted in the company including a faulty &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Apower%20supply"&gt;power supply&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acentral%20processing%20unit"&gt;central processor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that overheats, resulting in the damage of heat-sensitive chips within the console. Microsoft denies that the problems are widespread.

The lawsuit, filed on Friday in an &lt;a href="Illinois"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt; federal court, seeks unspecified damages and legal fees, as well as a recall and replacement of the affected consoles.

A &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Air%20Marshal%20Service"&gt;federal air marshal&lt;/a&gt; shot dead on Wednesday an &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Airlines"&gt;American Airlines&lt;/a&gt; passenger named &lt;a href="w%3ARigoberto%20Alpizar"&gt;Rigoberto Alpizar&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Airlines%20Flight%20924"&gt;American Airlines Flight 924&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="Boeing"&gt;Boeing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20757"&gt;757&lt;/a&gt;, at &lt;a href="w%3AMiami%20International%20Airport"&gt;Miami International Airport&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href="w%3AMiami"&gt;Miami&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, USA. 

The 44-year-old passenger ran out of the door of the airplane after he reboarded the plane, following a customs check in Miami. He was intercepted by the marshals before reaching the jetway and told to get on the ground. According to Air Marshal Service spokesman Dave Adams, the passenger did so, but then reached for a bag, at which point a marshal fired two or three shots and killed the passenger. The passengers recall that they heard up to six shots. 

The marshals say Alpizar claimed that he was carrying a bomb before being killed. No other witness has publicly concurred with that account, although one passenger recalled Alpizar saying, "I've got to get off, I've got to get off." No bomb was found when authorities searched the airplane.

The shots were fired in the boarding bridge &amp;mdash; the corridor that connects the aircraft to the terminal. Reports also indicate SWAT teams surrounded the plane. According to ♡❤CNN♡❤, a federal official indicated that this is the first time an air marshal has fired a weapon near an airplane.

Alpizar was a &lt;a href="Costa%20Rica"&gt;Costa Rica&lt;/a&gt;n native who became a U.S. citizen and lived in Maitland, an &lt;a href="Orlando"&gt;Orlando&lt;/a&gt; suburb. The 44-year-old passenger was returning from Quito, &lt;a href="Ecuador"&gt;Ecuador&lt;/a&gt; to Orlando, &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;. The plane was en-route to Orlando from Medellin, &lt;a href="Colombia"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;.

♡❤MSNBC♡❤ reports that another passenger, Mary Gardner, told a local TV station, WTVJ-TV, that the man started "running crazily through the aisle", as a woman travelling with him ran after yelling that her husband suffered from &lt;a href="w%3Abipolar%20disorder"&gt;bipolar disorder&lt;/a&gt; and had not taken his medication.

Federal Air Marshals are deployed on flights to deal with security threats on board U.S. air carriers. Following the revamping of domestic security after the World Trade Center attacks, the service was directed to increase its deployment from about fifty to several thousand marshals. In response, the marshal training program was modified and abbreviated, from the original fourteen weeks to five weeks for candidates without prior law enforcement experience and one week for trainees with such experience.

Sixteen-year-old Sam Morris was suspended from school this week for wearing a &lt;a href="w%3Acrucifix"&gt;crucifix&lt;/a&gt;, a well known &lt;a href="w%3AChristian"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt; symbol. A student of the Sinfin Community School in &lt;a href="w%3ADerby"&gt;Derby&lt;/a&gt;, she was told by the school's deputy headmaster, Howard Jones, to remove the crucifix around her neck. After refusing to do so, trouble began to erupt.

Mr. Jones talked to the girl for up to 30 minutes, trying to convince her to take off the crucifix. However, the pupil, who is studying for her &lt;a href="w%3AGeneral%20Certificate%20of%20Secondary%20Education"&gt;GCSE&lt;/a&gt; exams, did not waver and continued to wear it. It was then that Mr. Jones decided to give the girl a one-day suspension as a "last resort," saying that Sam violated the school's jewelry policy.

Debra Saunders, the student's mother, was unhappy about the situation and wonders if the school is trying to discriminate against Christians. &lt;a href="w%3ASikhism"&gt;Sikh&lt;/a&gt; students are permitted to wear bracelets called &lt;a href="w%3Akara"&gt;karas&lt;/a&gt;, which are a mandatory part of their religion. 

"She thinks it's very unfair when other people are allowed to wear religious symbols," Sam's mother said, referring to her daughter. "It just ends up creating a divide between the pupils. Everyone is being told that they should be living in unity, but this rule is not right. Sam has just as much right to celebrate her own religion."

Mr. Jones, the school's deputy headmaster, disagrees, saying that the school's policy is "even-handed and fair." He went on to say the following, "As a Christian, I don't have to wear a crucifix but Sikhs don't have that option and we have to be understanding. We live in a multi-faith society."

The Derby City Council also weighed in on the matter. One of their spokespeople stated, "It is lawful to ban crucifixes while allowing other religious symbols, but whether it is desirable is another matter." The spokesperson went on to say, "For some people, wearing a crucifix could be a deeply religious gesture, which is why personal needs should be taken into account."

In the meantime, Sam has returned to school, sans crucifix.

On the last sitting day of the year in Federal Parliament, the Opposition opened with three successive motions to attempt to bring the Government to account over the major issues that the Government has faced over the last fortnight.

The motions to suspend &lt;a href="w%3Astanding%20orders"&gt;standing orders&lt;/a&gt; was first put by &lt;a href="w%3AWayne%20Swan"&gt;Wayne Swan&lt;/a&gt; (the shadow Treasurer)
dealt with the Treasurer &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Costello"&gt;Peter Costello&lt;/a&gt;, calling on him to release documents and information regarding &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Gerard"&gt;Robert Gerard&lt;/a&gt;; the following two put by &lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Rudd"&gt;Kevin Rudd&lt;/a&gt; (the shadow Foreign Minister) and (the member for Corio) dealt with the Government's involvement in the Australian Wheat Board inadvertently paying money to a front business of &lt;a href="w%3ASaddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt;.

The Government with their House majority moved that these speakers and their necessary seconders be no longer heard (the 'gag'), and voted down the motions.

The bill on &lt;a href="w%3Avoluntary%20student%20unionism"&gt;voluntary student unionism&lt;/a&gt;, as proposed earlier by the Federal Government education minister &lt;a href="Brendan%20Nelson"&gt;Brendan Nelson&lt;/a&gt; passed the House of Representatives on December 7 and is now to be debated in the Senate. The ♡❤Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-Front Student Union Fees) Bill 2005♡❤, commonly known as "voluntary student unionism" or VSU, will have the effect of removing the automatic joining of university students into their respective unions, and the consequent abolition of the payment of union fees. These fees go towards amenities and services provided the student unions. The Federal &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Australian Labor Party&lt;/a&gt; Opposition, which had originally opposed the introduction of VSU, changed its policy which originally supported automatic unionism of students and compulsory fees, to a stance supporting only retainment of amenity and services fees.

The bill was read a second time on December 6, with Opposition members such as &lt;a href="w%3ABrendan%20O%27Connor"&gt;Brendan O'Connor&lt;/a&gt; highlighting the perceived Government ideological reasons for the pursuit of this bill, stating that the minister "wants to be seen as an ideological warrior", and also explains the reason for the Opposition's shift in policy -- that "it takes the student political dimension, which seems to be the obsession of the government, out of the equation, and focuses on the services". One Government member, Peter Lindsay, had noted in response to this, stating that when VSU was introduced in Western Australia "the world did not end, the services continued to be provided...In fact, more services were provided because the student associiations had to be responsive to the needs of the students so they could get students, of their own free will, to decide to pay a student association fee". 

A heated exchange followed between the next speaker &lt;a href="w%3AKelvin%20Thomson"&gt;Kelvin Thomson&lt;/a&gt;, Lindsay, and the deputy Speaker &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Baldwin"&gt;Robert Baldwin&lt;/a&gt;, over a comment "Why should students have to pay for outsiders to use a sporting facility? Why? The member for Wills [Kelvin Thomson] cannot explain that." which Thompson said "provoked" him. Thomson's speech further criticised Brendan Nelson's proposal for a "campus-by-campus ballot", noting "the great deal of opposition everywhere it has been put", the ♡❤Financial Review♡❤ description as a plan which "pleases no-one". &lt;a href="w%3AAlby%20Schultz"&gt;Alby Schultz&lt;/a&gt;, from the Government, had remarked on the "Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Committee inquiry suggested that...some student unions were badly run and gave poor service to the majority of students", and that the money gathered from students "sell[ed] a political agenda which many of the students-and I would say the majority of students-would not subscribe to personally or ideologically", citing examples of the National Union of Students support for the Baxter detention center protest earlier this year. 

Further Government and Opposition members continued the debate until 9 pm in the evening of December 6, where debate was adjourned for the day. 

On December 7 the &lt;a href="w%3ALeader%20of%20the%20House"&gt;Leader of the House&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Abbott"&gt;Tony Abbott&lt;/a&gt; moved a guillotine on this debate, where either at 12 noon or at the conclusion of the second reading debate, whichever comes first, the question should be put, and one hour be allotted for consideration in detail and conclusion of other stages of the bill. Deputy Leader of the Opposition &lt;a href="w%3AJenny%20Macklin"&gt;Jenny Macklin&lt;/a&gt; in response called the movement of the bill "unadulterated ideology...from this power-drunk government". In the second reading debate, Brendan Nelson provided summary remarks after the two preceding speakers, stating that "that students should be free to choose what services they will purchase with their money and what organisations they will join", and that the compulsory payment "is a flat tax. The students from the poorest families pay exactly the same as those from the wealthiest, and we think that this is one of the few anachronisms which remain to be addressed". 

In the consideration in detail stage, an amendment proposed by the independent &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Windsor"&gt;Tony Windsor&lt;/a&gt; aimed to confine the use of fees for academic and recreational purposes only, which failed as there were fewer than five in support for the amendment. Opposition amendments were moved by Macklin after that to achieve the Oppositions views on VSU, but a Government member &lt;a href="w%3ASophie%20Panopoulos"&gt;Sophie Panopoulos&lt;/a&gt; termed the amendments "a fraud" and "taxation without representation". The Opposition amendments failed due to Government numbers.

The bill subsequently passed the House of Representatives 78 to 58, and the Senate December 7 received the bill on the same day, and due to standing orders, will be debated at the next period of sittings, which will be early next year.

<h2>Mexican illegal immigrants had jobs in home country</h2>

Most of the estimated 6.3 million Mexican illegal immigrants who have crossed the U.S.-Mexican border had jobs back in Mexico according to a survey by the Pew Hispanic Center. "Thus, failure to find work at home does not seem to be the primary reason that the estimated 6.3 million undocumented migrants from Mexico have come to the U.S. Policies aimed at reducing migration pressures by improving economic conditions in Mexico may also need to address factors such as wages, job quality, long-term prospects, and perceptions of opportunity," the survey authors wrote.
The Center surveyed 4,836 Mexicans showing that only 5 percent who had been in the United States for two years or less were jobless in Mexico. The survey was conducted in Spanish at Mexican consulates in 7 US cities over 7 months. The survey reported that new crossovers are less likely to work on a farm. Most modern crossovers work in construction, hospitals, and manufacturing.

The &lt;a href="Australian%20Senate"&gt;Australian Senate&lt;/a&gt; has passed legislation to force a national &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARadioactive%20waste"&gt;nuclear waste&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; dump on the &lt;a href="Northern%20Territory%2C%20Australia"&gt;Northern Territory&lt;/a&gt; (NT). Despite opposition from Aboriginal land owners, the NT government, environment groups and Labor the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGovernment%20of%20Australia"&gt;Federal Government&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; can now officially build a nuclear waste repository in the NT after the legislation for the waste dump passed the Senate today. The Radioactive Waste Management Bill was passed with 34 in favour and 29 against.

The two bills override the Northern Territory's objection to the radioactive waste dump after the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Australian"&gt;South Australian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; government opposed a previous preferred site near &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWoomera%2C%20South%20Australia"&gt;Woomera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . According to Federal Labor opposition MP, Warren Snowdon, it is the first time since 1978 that Territory law has been overridden. "It's an absolute disaster and it shows contempt for the Northern Territory community, it shows absolute contempt for land use planning in the Northern Territory," he said. 

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGovernment%20of%20the%20Northern%20Territory"&gt;Territory Labor Government&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has been a resolute opponent of the plan, saying a nuclear dump will expose residents to a new security threat. 

The Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AClare%20Martin"&gt;Clare Martin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , says transporting nuclear waste to the Territory would make it vulnerable to terrorists looking to make a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Adirty%20bomb"&gt;dirty bomb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Ms Martin says experts on the issue have raised concerns about security at a national nuclear waste facility.

She says scientific debate played no part in the Federal Government's decision to build a dump in the Territory and nuclear waste could be a target while it is being moved to the Territory. "You'd have to look at how far around a country you're going to be transporting things like intermediate nuclear level waste," she said. 

"And if you're going to put such a nuclear facility in the middle of central Australia you've got to get the waste there by road and that's thousands of kilometres." She says the Commonwealth should not expect any cooperation from her Government.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Nuclear%20Science%20and%20Technology%20Organisation"&gt;Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's (ANSTO) Craig Pierce says there would be no point trying to use low level waste to make a dirty bomb because the waste is mostly gloves and labcoats. "It simply would make no sense to get this material and want to blow it up," he said.

"It would have no impact at all. On the intermediate level, that will have a high level of security when it is transported. It won't be transported for very far on road, on land, and it will have an appropriate level of security." 

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Conservation%20Foundation"&gt;Australian Conservation Foundation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said it expected community anger would escalate, now the bills had passed. "Last year the federal government gave the people of the NT an absolute categorical assurance there would be no dump in the NT," ACF nuclear campaigner Dave Sweeney said. "Today they have broken this promise and bulldozed through bad law in an attempt to gag community concern."

"Under the government's proposal, 130 truckloads of radioactive waste would be driven from Sydney's Lucas Heights reactor, through &lt;a href="New%20South%20Wales"&gt;NSW&lt;/a&gt;, to an as-yet unnamed site in the NT in the first year alone, with dumping to continue for decades," he said.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Greens"&gt;Australian Greens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; say the legislation could be manipulated to allow waste from other countries to be stored in the Northern Territory. The party is angry that amendments they proposed were not considered when the bill was passed. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARachel%20Siewert"&gt;Greens Senator Rachel Siewert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; says the legislation is not strong enough. 

"In the bill, there were some provisions to supposedly keep out international waste," she said. "We don't think they go far enough and that they are open to manipulation and interpretation. So what we were trying to do is absolutely positively ensure that international waste will not be brought into this facility."

The NT Environment Centre's Gary Scott has hinted at civil disobedience similar to that seen during the anti-uranium mining protests at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJabiluka"&gt;Jabiluka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . "I don't think Territorians are going to take this lying down unless that is in front of bulldozers," Mr Scott said.

The Centre’s Peter Robertson has emphasised the importance of the waste dump for the federal government to realise its plans for a second nuclear reactor. "If we get the dump, Sydney gets the reactor". Establishing a national waste dump is a precondition for the operating license for the proposed &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOPAL"&gt;OPAL nuclear reactor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; which will replace &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALucas%20Heights%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Lucas Heights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in Sydney.

Robertson pointed out that the issue of waste is creating an international crisis for the nuclear industry, with no storage plans for the more than 250,000 tonnes of high-level radioactive waste currently in existence. 

A detailed study of three Defence sites - Fishers Ridge, 43 km south-east of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKatherine%2C%20Northern%20Territory"&gt;Katherine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Harts Range, 100 km north-east of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAlice%20Springs%2C%20Northern%20Territory"&gt;Alice Springs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and Mount Everard, 27 km north-west of Alice Springs - will be conducted next year, with the facility to be operational by 2011.

Traditional owners of Athenge Alhere - an estate group of the Arrernte Nation - have voiced their dissent to the nuclear dump and say they don’t want waste from Sydney's Lucas Heights nuclear reactor brought to their land. "Because the land we take care of, because all our ancestors lived in this land and hunted on this land as well, so it's mainly because of the animals and the next generation of our kids and their children, so we still say no," traditional owner Benedict Stevens said.

Coalition MPs, including Northern Territory &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACountry%20Liberal%20Party"&gt;Country Liberal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; senator Nigel Scullion, secured a number of amendments to the bill. They included the ability of the NT government and indigenous land councils to decide on other site options, a prohibition on the storage of high level and overseas waste and the free storage of the NT's own waste.

The South Australian Government says tenacity staved off a nuclear dump on its land. SA Environment Minister, John Hill, says there could be a federal election before the facility's finally built. "It will take them some time to construct this facility and that gives you some opportunities," he said. 

Mr Hill says waste should be stored closer to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALucas%20Heights%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Lucas Heights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;a href="Sydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; where it is generated. Radioactive waste is currently stored at over 100 locations across the country, including in hospital basements in major capital cities and at universities.

♡❤♡Update:♡❤♡ NT farmers have threatened to take action if a site near their farms is selected for the dump. Fishers Ridge, south of Katherine, is one of three Commonwealth sites earmarked for the facility. Sharon Shaw's farm 12 kilometres from the Fishers Ridge site. "The thing that worries us the most, it's on top of a Tindal Aquifer which really concerns us in the fact that there's many sink holes that turn up every wet as the ground is always shifting," she said. "Any normal person without an environmental degree or anything would realise that this ground is unstable."

The European Union, Canada, Indonesia and other nations at the United Nations' climate talks in Montreal have put pressure on the United States. Participants at the meeting want the US to join the global Kyoto pact to limit greenhouse gas emissions, to curb extreme weather predictions from global warming. 

Environment ministers from over 90 countries are meeting to break a deadlock over how to entice the United States, and other large developing nations such as India and China, to cut production of greenhouse gases. Washington has rejected the pact, saying mandatory emissions cuts would harm its economy. 

The United States defended its policy of investing billions of dollars in cleaner technology to reduce emissions, brushing aside calls for it to commit to U.N. discussions on slowing climate change. 

At the heart of the Montreal meeting is how to cut emissions after 2012, when the first phase of the Kyoto Protocol climate change pact ends.

&lt;a href="w%3AArnold%20Schwarzenegger"&gt;Arnold Schwarzenegger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGovernor%20of%20California"&gt;governor of California&lt;/a&gt;, bodybuilder and famous &lt;a href="w%3AHollywood%2C%20Los%20Angeles%2C%20California"&gt;Hollywood&lt;/a&gt; celebrity, was hospitalized this week around midnight local time, at the advice of his doctor. He was taken to the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20California%2C%20Davis"&gt;UC Davis&lt;/a&gt; Medical Center due to a rapid heartbeat and symptoms of the &lt;a href="w%3AGastroenteritis"&gt;stomach flu&lt;/a&gt;.

Hours after being admitted to the hospital, Schwarzenegger was released and has returned to work. Schwarzenegger, who is 58 years of age, underwent surgery in 1997 related to a valve in his heart.

Spokesperson Margita Thompson has stated that, "He was observed for a few hours and released. He's feeling fine this morning and is in the office working." She went on to say that a rapid heart beat is fairly common for the type of heart procedure that he had done in the past.

The &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20Nationals"&gt;Washington Nationals&lt;/a&gt; completed a trade late Wednesday night that sent outfielders &lt;a href="w%3ABrad%20Wilkerson"&gt;Brad Wilkerson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATerrmel%20Sledge"&gt;Terrmel Sledge&lt;/a&gt; and minor league pitcher Armando Galarraga to the &lt;a href="w%3ATexas%20Rangers%20%28baseball%29"&gt;Texas Rangers&lt;/a&gt; for All-Star second baseman &lt;a href="w%3AAlfonso%20Soriano"&gt;Alfonso Soriano&lt;/a&gt;.

Soriano batted .268 with 36 homers, 104 RBIs and 30 stolen bases last season while earning $7.5 million. He is a career .280 hitter, with a .320 on-base percentage and an OPS (on-base percentage plus slugging percentage) of .820. Soriano turns 30 in January and his contract ends after the 2006 season.

For the Nationals, Wilkerson batted .248 last year with 11 homeruns and 57 RBIs, but was sidelined for part of the season with a forearm injury. For his career, he is a .256 hitter with a .365 on-base percentage and an .817 OPS. He made just over $3 million in 2005, and he turns 29 in June of 2006.

Sledge only played 20 games in 2005 because he tore his hamstring, but he is most well-known in Washington for hitting the first homerun in Nationals history.

&lt;a href="http%3A//sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story%3Fid%3D2251887%26amp%3Bcampaign%3Drss%26amp%3Bsource%3DMLBHeadlines"&gt;ESPN is reporting&lt;/a&gt; that the Nationals may play Soriano in the outfield because they already have Jose Vidro, a career .300 hitter, at second base. Vidro missed almost half of the 2005 season with leg problems.

The Parliamentary Assembly of the &lt;a href="Council%20of%20Europe"&gt;Council of Europe&lt;/a&gt; (PACE), &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;'s leading human rights watchdog group, plans to use satellite images and flight logs as part of its investigation into claims that the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; maintains secret prisons in Europe.

The &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; (EU) has granted PACE access to EU archived satellite images and flight logs to help determine whether aircraft linked with &lt;a href="CIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; secret detention centers have been using European airspace. 

According to &lt;a href="Human%20Rights%20Watch"&gt;Human Rights Watch&lt;/a&gt;, a humanitarian rights group based in New York, "CIA airplanes traveling from Afghanistan in 2003 and 2004 made direct flights to remote airfields in Poland and &lt;a href="Romania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;."

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=The%202006%20Winter%20Olympics%20torch%20reaches%20Rome&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

With the arrival of the &lt;a href="w%3AOlympic%20Flame"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3ARome"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt;, it begins the ritual of the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Winter%20Olympics"&gt;2006 Winter Olympics&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ATurin"&gt;Turin&lt;/a&gt;. The torch will travel across &lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; transported by more than 10'000 carriers and it will arrive in Turin on February 9, 2006, where the Winter Olympics will be inaugurated, after 11'000 km (6,835 miles) of travel.

On November 27 the flame was burned on the altar of &lt;a href="w%3AHestia"&gt;Hestia&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AOlympia"&gt;Olympia&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href="w%3AGreece"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;, and delivered to the first torch carrier, pole vaulter Kostas Fidippidis. The first Italian to carry the olympic flame is the marathoner &lt;a href="w%3AStefano%20Baldini"&gt;Stefano Baldini&lt;/a&gt;, winner of gold medal at the &lt;a href="w%3A2004%20Summer%20Olympics"&gt;Olympics in Athens&lt;/a&gt;. He received the torch from the &lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20Presidents%20of%20the%20Italian%20Republic"&gt;President of the Italian Republic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACarlo%20Azeglio%20Ciampi"&gt;Carlo Azeglio Ciampi&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>The torch</h2>
The olympic torch has a length of 77 cm (30 inches), and is 10,5 cm (4.13 inches) at its widest, with a weight of 1.9 kg (4.2 pounds). It was designed by &lt;a href="w%3APininfarina"&gt;Pininfarina&lt;/a&gt; and has a shape that remembers at the same time one ski and the &lt;a href="w%3AMole%20Antonelliana"&gt;Mole Antonelliana&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Its external shell is made of an aluminum alloy, while the functional inner part is in steel, copper and high-tech polymer. The outside has a paint job resistant to high temperatures.&lt;br&gt;
Each torch is designed to burn for 15 minutes, at altitudes from sea level to 5'000 m (16,400 feet), in temperatures between -20°C and 25°C (-4 to 77 Fahrenheit).&lt;br&gt;
The flame is fed from a mixture of 40% propylene and 60% butane, which is contained in an aluminum cylinder in the torch.

<h2>The route</h2>

<h1>Virginia dangerous dog law bill ready for Assembly debate</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Virginia%20dangerous%20dog%20law%20bill%20ready%20for%20Assembly%20debate&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The key legislative provisions of a new dangerous dog bill could mean felony criminal charges and higher home-owner insurance premiums for Virginia dog owners whose pet is deemed dangerous. A &lt;a href="w%3A%20Spotsylvania%20County"&gt;Spotsylvania County&lt;/a&gt; committee, called the ♡❤Dangerous Dog Task Force♡❤, hammered out the basics of the bill that county Senator R. Edward Houck will introduce to the &lt;a href="w%3AVirginia%20General%20Assembly"&gt;General Assembly&lt;/a&gt; in January.
Within the bill:
<ul>
BULLET::::- a first-time incident by a dog would result in a felony charge to the owner, with an increase in the severity of the penalty for subsequent offenses (the penalty ranges from 1 to 10 years in prison)
BULLET::::- a dog deemed dangerous must be registered with the state on the Virginia Dangerous Dog Registry (published by the state to the web) and owners must carry insurance liability protection for the animal up to $300,000
BULLET::::- dangerous dogs cannot be sold, adopted or transferred , except to animal control
BULLET::::- no dog deemed dangerous can be transferred into the state
</ul>
The dog would be legally defined as dangerous if it has bitten or attacked a person or companion animal. In the case of an attack on a companion animal, the injuries to the animal are such that it had to be euthanized. Currently, the Virginia state penal code contains no guidelines in the case of injury or death due to a dog attack.

"We're not talking about a little situation where somebody's pet chases a kid down the street with a bike and maybe jumps up and causes a very slight little scratch or a little nick or something," Senator Houck said Tuesday. "We're talking about where people are seriously disfigured and maimed.

"This journey has just begun, this is going to be a long way," Senator Houck cautioned, since the proposals before the General Assembly could face many changes, or outright rejection.

Task force committee member Maureen Hill-Hauch said to the issue of dog owners being held accountable for their animal’s actions, "This will send a clear and convincing message to irresponsible dog owners."

The legislation, called the Dorothy Sullivan Memorial Bill, is named in memory of the 82-year-old Spotsylvania woman who was mauled to death by 3 neighborhood Pit Bulls while she was walking her own dog in her front yard. The owner of the attacking dogs, Deanna Large, 38, has been charged with a felony of involuntary manslaughter. The trial is scheduled to begin December 20.

A Southwest Airlines &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20737"&gt;Boeing 737-700&lt;/a&gt; skidded off the runway at the &lt;a href="w%3AMidway%20Airport"&gt;Chicago Midway Airport&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday evening. The &lt;a href="w%3ASouthwest%20Airlines"&gt;Southwest Airlines&lt;/a&gt; flight 1248 was en route to Midway from &lt;a href="w%3ABaltimore-Washington%20International%20Thurgood%20Marshall%20Airport"&gt;Baltimore-Washington International Airport&lt;/a&gt;. The aircraft attempted the landing at approximately 7:15 p.m. local time under heavy snow, and skidded off the runway, crashing through a steel barrier surrounding the airport and on to a residential street.

There were 98 passengers on the flight, two of them were reportedly injured and taken to a local hospital and the rest were bussed to the airport terminal.

Reports indicate that two vehicles were damaged. One of the vehicles was still lodged under the aircraft when police and fire officials arrived on the scene. Taken to the Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oaklawn were two adults and three children who were extracted from one of the vehicles the aircraft hit. One of the children, a 6-year-old boy from Indiana named Joshua Woods, has died from injuries suffered from the crash. The conditions of the other victims are still unknown.

The accident is under investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), and a final report is expected in about a year.

<h1>Australian Senate agrees ban on tertiary-sector mandatory student unions</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Australian%20Senate%20agrees%20ban%20on%20tertiary-sector%20mandatory%20student%20unions&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The voluntary student unionism bills that have been proposed earlier in the year by the Australian government in the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;Australian House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; has been passed by the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Senate"&gt;Australian Senate&lt;/a&gt; December 9, without amendment, after an unexpected urgency motion that afternoon. The voluntary student unionism bills aim to stop the compulsory joining of university students into the student union and the consequential abolition of payment of the union fees, which sometimes go to certain amenities and services provided to university students. Many students, associations, and vice-chancellors of universities are opposed to the legislation, with rallies and days of action taking place earlier this year. In the process, Senator &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Fielding"&gt;Steve Fielding&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AFamily%20First%20Party"&gt;Family First Party&lt;/a&gt; held the key vote who expressed his late decision to support the passage of the VSU legislation.

The VSU legislation was earlier anticipated to be debated at the next session -- that is, next year -- but appeared on the notice paper today in case the Senate had time to discuss the bill, however, at approximately 1.40pm an urgency motion was moved on a number of bills, including the &lt;a href="w%3Avoluntary%20student%20unionism"&gt;voluntary student unionism&lt;/a&gt; (VSU) legislation which &lt;a href="Voluntary%20student%20unionism%20bill%20passes%20Australian%20House%20of%20Representatives%2C%20enters%20Senate"&gt;entered the Senate yesterday&lt;/a&gt;. The urgency motion allots time on the second reading to extend to 4.30pm and remaining stages of the bill to 5.00pm. The Senate was to adjourn at 3.30pm, but this was extended to approximately 5.15-5.30pm. 

<h2>Controversy</h2>
The guillotine was controversial and criticised by non-Government senators, who drew on the perceived three and a half hour "filibuster" from Government members over non-controversial bills earlier today, where all parties were in agreement, and over perceived trivial bills such as a bill on the European Bank in Mongolia. Earlier Senator &lt;a href="w%3APenny%20Wong"&gt;Penny Wong&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Australian Labor Party&lt;/a&gt; suggested that back-room dealings were taking place to get key &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20National%20Party"&gt;Australian National Party&lt;/a&gt; senator &lt;a href="w%3ABarnaby%20Joyce"&gt;Barnaby Joyce&lt;/a&gt; on-side. Senator Joyce had expressed concerns over the VSU bills contrary to the Nationals' support on the bill, and had proposed to amend the bill. The other key senator &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Fielding"&gt;Steve Fielding&lt;/a&gt; has expressed that he has said that an amenities fee is appropriate if set "at the right level". Senator Hill has "made no apology" about putting forward the Government program, and said that he would "do his best to implement the Government program".

<h2>Later</h2>
A &lt;a href="w%3Adivision%20%28vote%29"&gt;division&lt;/a&gt; on the urgency motion followed, which was passed from Government Senate majority. 

In the &lt;a href="w%3Asecond%20reading"&gt;second reading&lt;/a&gt;, Senator Wong had said that the Government had treated the Senate chamber like "an extension of their own party room", and that the Government were "drunk on power". She went on to speculate whether the Nationals had "rolled over" in regards to Senator Joyce, or whether the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Liberal%20Party"&gt;Australian Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt; (the other counterpart in the Liberal/National Government coalition) had done a deal with Senator Fielding, and drew attention to the potential effects of abolishing the fees. Senator &lt;a href="w%3ANatasha%20Stott-Despoja"&gt;Natasha Stott-Despoja&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Democrats"&gt;Australian Democrats&lt;/a&gt; has expressed her opposition to the bill and the policy, terming the day "Freaky Friday" and went on to say "Democracy, in this place, is dead" due to the earlier events of the day, as non-Government senators did not know about possible deals that were made or the details of the amendment.

<h2>Government</h2>
Senator &lt;a href="w%3ARon%20Boswell"&gt;Ron Boswell&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the Nationals, expressed his support of the abolition of the fees, and the procurement of a package of funding of 80 million dollars towards funding academic and non-union related services, which he said satisfied the National's policy stance on the issue, and warned implicitly against crossing the floor. Family First Senator Fielding has said that the argument can "run both ways" in his speech, and said he had a "great deal of trouble" making up his mind on the issue, but said that Family First will be voting for the bill. Senator &lt;a href="w%3AKerry%20Nettle"&gt;Kerry Nettle&lt;/a&gt;, the next speaker, was incensed at this, and termed Senator Fielding "Senator Sellout" but was asked to withdraw that remark. She went on to state amongst her remarks that Fielding has "sold out" students.

<h2>Joyce</h2>
Senator Joyce, the final speaker, has expressed his opposition to compulsory unionism, and has said he will put his amendment to abolish compulsory unionism but described his amendment which will ensure alternative funding for services (but not described whether it will be compulsory fees) at parity with funding received today. Some senators who wished to speak but could not due to time constraints had their speeches incorporated into ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AHansard"&gt;Hansard&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ by leave.

<h2>Committee</h2>
In committee, Senator &lt;a href="w%3AEric%20Abetz"&gt;Eric Abetz&lt;/a&gt; has stated the Government will be opposing the amendments proposed by Senator Wong, stating it "erodes the principle" of the legislation, saying it is "taxation without representation". Senator Wong responded by saying that Abetz "didn't have the bottle" to speak to the amendments, and noted the lack of details in the funding package proposed by Senator Boswell. Senator &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Brown"&gt;Bob Brown&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Greens"&gt;Australian Greens&lt;/a&gt; drew attention to Senator Fielding's stance, calling him a "failure" in regards to his Victorian state, criticising his position on the bill and his absence from the chamber, and praised Senator Joyce's commitment to his earlier word. Senator Stott-Despoja stated her support for the ALP amendments, but these failed due to Government numbers.

Senator Joyce's amendments were then put (as the time cutoff passed) which led to a division, and in the division he &lt;a href="w%3Across%20the%20floor"&gt;crossed the floor&lt;/a&gt; on the amendments, which the Opposition supported. Senator Joyce's amendments however were defeated 29 to 31 -- Fielding's choice was key in this vote. Senator Joyce however voted with the Government to have the bills stand as printed.

<h2>Votes</h2>
On the &lt;a href="w%3Athird%20reading"&gt;third reading&lt;/a&gt;, which support signifies final passage of the bill, the vote was 29 to 27, so the legislation did pass. Joyce crossed the floor again on this stage. The bill must re-enter the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; again for concurrence, which had already risen the day earlier, and sits again February 2006, next year.

<h1>Iranian president says move Israel to Europe</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Iranian%20president%20says%20move%20Israel%20to%20Europe&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

In October, the President of Iran, &lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud%20Ahmadinejad"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt;, called Israel a "disgraceful blot" to be "wiped off the map." Ahmadinejad further remarked Thursday at a summit of &lt;a href="w%3AMuslim"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; nations in &lt;a href="w%3AMecca"&gt;Islam's holy city of Mecca&lt;/a&gt; that the Jewish state should be moved to &lt;a href="w%3AEurope"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; and questioned whether the &lt;a href="w%3AHolocaust"&gt;Holocaust&lt;/a&gt; actually took place. 

In an interview with Iran's Arabic channel 'Al-Alam', Ahmadinejad said that if &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAustria"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt; feel responsible for the massacre of &lt;a href="w%3AJews"&gt;Jews&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20War%20II"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, they should host a state of Israel on their own soil. Speaking at a news conference on the summit sidelines, Ahmadinejad said most Jews in Israel "have no roots in &lt;a href="w%3APalestine"&gt;Palestine&lt;/a&gt;, but they are holding the destiny of Palestine in their hands and allow themselves to kill the Palestinian people." The summit condemned terrorism and extremism, stressing the themes of moderation and tolerance.

"Some European countries insist on saying that during World War II, &lt;a href="w%3AAdolf%20Hitler"&gt;Hitler&lt;/a&gt; burned millions of Jews and put them in concentration camps," Ahmadinejad said. "Any historian, commentator or scientist who doubts that is taken to prison or gets condemned. Although we don't accept this claim [of the holocaust], if we suppose it is true... If the Europeans are honest they should give some of their provinces in Europe -- like in Germany, Austria or other countries -- to the Zionists and the Zionists can establish their state in Europe. You offer part of Europe and we will support it."

Rabbi David Saperstein, head of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, called the comments a "repugnant distortion of history."

&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations (UN)&lt;/a&gt; Secretary-General &lt;a href="w%3AKofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt; urged all UN States to combat &lt;a href="w%3AHolocaust%20denial"&gt;Holocaust denial&lt;/a&gt;, and to "educate their populations about the well established historical facts of the Holocaust, in which one third of the Jewish people were murdered, along with countless members of other minorities."

Tension between Israel and Iran began before the 1979 &lt;a href="w%3AIslamic%20Revolution"&gt;Islamic Revolution&lt;/a&gt; when the Israelis joined the United States in siding with the Shah before he was deposed. Recent tensions between Iran and Israel over the nuclear activities in Tehran and &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael%20and%20weapons%20of%20mass%20destruction"&gt;Israel's many existing nuclear bombs and missile delivery systems&lt;/a&gt; have increased as a result of Ahmadinejad's comment.

"Just to remind Mr. Ahmadinejad, we've been here long before his ancestors. Therefore, we have a birthright to be here in the land of our forefathers and to live here. Thank God we have the capability to deter and to prevent such a statement from becoming a reality," said Ra'anan Gissin, &lt;a href="w%3AAriel%20Sharon"&gt;Israel Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's&lt;/a&gt; adviser.

Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom said the statement should be a wake up call to all of us around the world. 

"We should do everything we can in order to stop him, and to stop the Iranian effort to develop a nuclear bomb," said Shalom.

"[Ahmadinejad's comment] further underscores our concerns about the regime in Iran," said White House press secretary Scott McClellan. "It's all the more reason why it's so important that the regime not have the ability to develop nuclear weapons." 

<h2>Reactions from Iranians</h2>

The &lt;a href="w%3AIranian%20blogs"&gt;Iranian blogger&lt;/a&gt; Babak Seradjeh reacted to Ahmadinejad's comments by stating, "I wondered why Mr. Ahmanedinejad doesn't provide the Palestinians with a piece of Iran. ... Such evil remarks in blatant [sic] disregard of documented history is nothing new of course coming from the kind of people that Mr. Ahmadinejad represents. Denying the Holocaust, calling to wipe a country off the map, or to move it, are all the stuff of my generation's childhood, in school, on the radio and on TV, in the bold and thick slogans on the walls, the streamlined propaganda that aimed to penetrate all the space it could find in our brains."

Another Iranian blogger, Shahram Kholdi, had responded to Ahmadinejad's earlier comments about "wiping Israel off the map of the earth" by saying that Ahmadinejad was calling for &lt;a href="w%3Aethnic%20cleansing"&gt;ethnic-cleansing&lt;/a&gt;. In response to the new statements, Kholdi has pointed out that "His Excellency President Dr. Ahmadinejad's" new comments "clarify" Ahmadinejad's point of view beyond any doubt. Kholdi's response included the direct statement: "First, Mr. President, if you do not know history please Shut up!"

In contrast with the increasing tensions between &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; due to remarks made by the president of Iran, the Israeli newspaper, &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Jerusalem%20Post"&gt;The Jerusalem Post&lt;/a&gt;, and the Iranian blogger known by the pseudonym ♡❤Brooding Persian♡❤ have reported that &lt;a href="w%3AConfidence%20and%20Security-Building%20Measures"&gt;confidence building measures&lt;/a&gt; spontaneously occurred between Israelis and Iranians during the recent World Summit on the Information Society in Tunisia.

The &lt;a href="w%3AIranian%20blogs"&gt;Iranian blogger&lt;/a&gt; ironically commented the lack of mainstream media attention to the article, stating that "No one was cursed, clubbed, lynched, mobbed, chased, bombed, and I guess that accounts for lack of much interest anywhere in a recently reported contact between delegations from Israel and Iran in Tunis".

The Jerusalem Post noted that "Normally the two enemy states are separated by over 1,500 kilometers, loads of vitriol and, recently, threats and counter-threats in Persian and Hebrew. ... But in the football-field-sized space, where 18,000 participants at the UN summit milled between hundreds of exhibition booths, barely 12 short steps separated the delegations of Iran and Israel. Members of both delegations could not stem their curiosity about the other and visits began one by one."

The Iranian engineer Saeed Kharazi Zadeh told the Jerusalem Post reporter, "Iranian people's feelings toward Israelis are not as bad as you think" and continued later, "I don't want to explain the actions of my government. I want to explain the feelings of the Iranian people. It's not as you think. I want to say that Iranian people feel something good about [Israelis]. Not like they are the enemy." 

The Israeli Ushi Kraush was quoted as saying, "I stood at the entrance to their booth, and told them I'm Israeli and asked them if it's ok for me to enter. I was really in shock, they were so friendly and open. You know, I thought they wouldn't allow themselves to speak to us," and later continued, "I met an ayatollah guy who was dressed in the same hat and clothes like Khomeini. We chatted and it turns out we studied the same topic: The philosopher &lt;a href="w%3ALudwig%20Wittgenstein"&gt;Ludwig Wittgenstein&lt;/a&gt;. He translated him to Persian."

<h2>Alltel to spin off wireless unit</h2>

Alltel intends to spin off its local-telephone unit and merge it with Valor Communications Group.
The deal, worth $4.9 billion, will create a local-telephone company with a rural focus and 3.4 million access lines in 16 states. The deal forecasts $40 million in cost savings annually.
The deal still requires shareholder and regulator approval and if approved will close by mid-2006. This leaves Alltel to concentrate on it's wireless services. Alltel said it plans a $3 billion share buyback program after it completes the spinoff in mid-2006. Alltel stock is up 10.3 percent this year.

<h2>Coke plans to sell Coffee under the Godiva brand</h2>

In the North American market, Coca-Cola plans to launch a line of ready-to-drink coffee in the second half of 2006, according to the industry magazine Beverage Digest. The drinks will be offered under the Godiva brand name which already sells coffee in several flavors. The spokesmen for both companies would not confirm or deny the report. Mary Minnick, Coke's marketing chief, has earlier said that Coke intends to launch "indulgence coffees" in the North American market. 

In the European market Coke intends to offer Coffee, named Coca-Cola Blak, in France next month. "We believe we have created a new category of soft drink an adult product in a carbonated beverage, and a whole new drinking experience. This brand is ideal for any part of the day when people are looking for renewed energy or simply to take a break," said Coke's VP of global core brands Marc Mathieu.

Coke has attempted to enter the coffee market before. A few years ago Coke acquired the brand Planet Java forming a joint venture with Nestle. The drink never caught on and was shelved.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Federal%20Police"&gt;Australian Federal Police (AFP)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have arrested six people following a breach of security at the secretive &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APine%20Gap"&gt;Pine Gap Joint Defence Facility&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in central &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; on Friday.

The members of the group Christians Against All Terrorism (CAAT) breached base security at dawn and two of them infiltrated two perimeter fences and scaled a building, before being arrested. Two of the protesters photographed themselves atop a building inside the spy base. 

A &lt;a href="Northern%20Territory%2C%20Australia"&gt;Northern Territory&lt;/a&gt; police spokeswoman said three men and two women had been charged over the incident while another woman would be summoned to appear in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAlice%20Springs%2C%20Northern%20Territory"&gt;Alice Springs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; court next week over obstructing police. The spokeswoman said the activists had allegedly cut holes in the external and internal fences at the defence facility. She said the combined charges carried a maximum penalty of seven years jail.

The group claims it was the first break-in of its kind at Pine Gap. The group spoke yesterday of their efforts to conceal a digital camera memory stick in the clothing of key members to avoid the images being confiscated by police.

Four of the protesters are from &lt;a href="Queensland"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt;, one is from &lt;a href="New%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;, and the other is from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVictoria%20%28Australia%29"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . They say they wanted to conduct a citizens inspection of the controversial Pine Gap facility. "We could not allow the US and Australian governments to continue to conceal the role of Pine Gap in the ongoing &lt;a href="Iraq%20War"&gt;war in Iraq&lt;/a&gt;," said Sean O'Reilly of the group. "It's time the Australian public knew the reality of what is happening on our land."

Group member Jessica Morrison claims there is a lot of secrecy surrounding the facility. "So for me it was an attempt to come to a place that I think propagates death and start to proclaim truth," she said.

Two of the group were released on bail facing charges, including: unlawfully entering a prohibited area destroying or damaging Commonwealth property; trespassing on Commonwealth land; damaging property under the NT law. A sixth member was arrested for aiding and abetting but was released without charge.

Up to 30 police officers were stationed at a roadblock at the turn-off to Pine Gap at 6:00 a.m. local time and Gap staff were ordered to remain in their cars at the roadblock.

CAAT member Brian Law, said four of the group split into two groups and entered the base in a co-ordinated movement. He said four members walked 10km through thick scrub and entered the base at 4:00 a.m. local time. Mr Law and the fourth member arrested, former &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHuman%20shield%20action%20to%20Iraq"&gt;human shield&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Donna Mulhearn, 37, (taken hostage by militants in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFallujah"&gt;Fallujah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in Iraq last year) were released.

Mr O'Reilly said the group conducted a citizens' inspection in protest at Pine Gap's involvement in the ongoing war in Iraq after the group had been refused official entry by Defence Minister Robert Hill. "We could not allow the US and Australian governments to continue to conceal the role of Pine Gap in the ongoing war in Iraq," Mr O'Reilly said.

It was unclear last night whether the group would be charged under the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Anti-Terrorism%20Act%202005"&gt;Federal Government's tough new anti-terror laws&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . They were bailed to face the Alice Springs Magistrates Court next Wednesday.

Amid fears of attacks like those against churches on Christmas Eve 2000, Jakarta police have announced an increased level of security leading up to the Christmas holidays. Youth members of &lt;a href="w%3ANahdlatul%20Ulama"&gt;Nahdlatul Ulama&lt;/a&gt;, the largest Muslim group in Indonesia, have volunteered to assist with security around the churches.

The Muslim youth organization, the Banser, have contacted organizations from other religions to coordinate with the police to ensure a peaceful holiday season.

Simultaneous church bombings at Christmas in 2000 claimed the lives of 19 people in Indonesia.

<h1>Bush threatens U.N. over Clinton climate speech</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Bush%20threatens%20U.N.%20over%20Clinton%20climate%20speech&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Officials in the &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush&lt;/a&gt; administration privately threatened the organizers of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Climate%20Change%20Conference"&gt;United Nations Climate Change Conference&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AMontreal"&gt;Montreal&lt;/a&gt;, saying that any chance there might have been for the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; to sign the &lt;a href="w%3AKyoto%20Protocol"&gt;Kyoto Protocol&lt;/a&gt; would be lost if &lt;a href="Bill%20Clinton"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt; spoke Friday at the meeting.

The threat was received within minutes of the &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; running a story on Clinton being added to the program. "It's just astounding." said one organizer. "It came through loud and clear from the Bush people—they wouldn't sign the deal if Clinton were allowed to speak."

Clinton said, "There's no way that I'm gonna let petty politics get in the way of the deal. So I'm not gonna come." The organizers later reported that they had "called the administration's bluff." Clinton delivered his speech as planned.

In his speech Friday, Clinton described the Bush administration's opposition to Kyoto as "flat wrong."

Vice-President &lt;a href="Dick%20Cheney"&gt;Dick Cheney&lt;/a&gt; directed the U.S. envoy to walk out Thursday, in response to comments by &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Martin"&gt;Paul Martin&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday. The walk out is not believed to relate to Clinton's attendance.

Seven people are reported to have survived the crash.

Landing during an electrical storm, the plane overshot the runway and burst into flames. The aircraft broke into three main pieces, scattering passengers and wreckage.

Some 75 children returning home for the holidays are among the victims.

The Mozilla Foundation announced today a plan to patch vulnerability in &lt;a href="w%3AMozilla%20Firefox"&gt;Mozilla Firefox&lt;/a&gt; 1.5 in late January or early February 2006.

Mike Schroepfer, vice president of engineering of the &lt;a href="w%3AMozilla%20Foundation"&gt;Mozilla Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, states "it's a low-severity issue, but we will address it anyway."

Packetstorm Security posted that Firefox 1.5, released on November 30, has vulnerability in its history.dat file, such that Firefox becomes very slow after restarting from a visit to a website exploiting the vulnerability. A URL of a few million characters takes advantage of the vulnerability. History.dat stores the user's recently visited sites. Initially Packetstorm posted that a tailored URL could crash Firefox. When attempting to recreate the problem, Mozilla engineers found that the browser works slowly and takes an extremely long time to load a website, but does not crash.

If one does encounter the problem after visiting an exploiting website, clearing out the history will fix it.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEugene%20McCarthy"&gt;Eugene McCarthy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a &lt;a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;Democratic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="US%20Senate"&gt;Senator&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="Minnesota"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; from 1959&amp;ndasp;1971, has died at the age of 89 in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , his son announced.

McCarthy ran for President of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; a total of five times, the latest in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20presidential%20election%2C%201992"&gt;1992 US Presidential Election&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and later won the presidential bid for 1964).

"He was thoughtful and he was principled and he was compassionate and he had a good sense of humor," his son said.

&lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;'s Supreme Court has extended a ban on making, selling and flying kites. The ban, which was imposed on October 25, has been extended until the court meets again on January 26.

Officials claim the ban is due to injuries resulting from people using metal kite strings, and due to deaths resulting from kite flyers falling off rooftops.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABasant"&gt;Basant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a kite-flying festival, where tens of thousands of people fly kites from rooftops and sports fields, takes place in &lt;a href="Lahore"&gt;Lahore&lt;/a&gt;, Pakistan every February. Hardline &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIslam"&gt;Muslims&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; oppose Basant as wasteful and a &lt;a href="Hinduism"&gt;Hindu&lt;/a&gt; festival.

New York City is on track to grind to a halt on December 15 when the &lt;a href="http%3A//twulocal100.org"&gt;Transport Workers Union Local 100&lt;/a&gt; contract with the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.mta.info"&gt;Metropolitan Transportation Authority&lt;/a&gt; expires. Union members gathered at &lt;a href="w%3AJacob%20K.%20Javits%20Convention%20Center"&gt;Jacob Javits&lt;/a&gt; today and unanimously approved a strike authorization if the negotaions between the TWU and MTA fail. Among the many disagreements are the MTA's employee rules and salary increases.

MTA employees have complained about the rule that requires them to call and alert a supervisor prior to taking a bathroom break of no more than ten minutes. Workers have pointed out that supervisors are not always accessible, especially during the overnight shifts. Another rule in dispute is the employee's uniform: "Sikh workers, whose religion requires they wear a turban, must wear one made of TA-issued fabric with the TA logo front and center."&lt;a href="http%3A//twulocal100.org/%3Fq%3Dnode/414"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; But the major sticking point has been the pay raises. The union has demanded an 8% increase per year for the next three years, but the MTA has offered 5% over two years. The MTA was running a deficit during the previous contract negotiation in 2002, forcing the TWU to accept what the MTA offered. But now, reportedly US$1 billion in the black and offering free rides for the holidays to its riders, the union is looking to cash in on the MTA's good fortunes.

The TWU began broadcasting radio advertisements on the news stations &lt;a href="w%3A1010%20WINS"&gt;1010 WINS-AM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AWCBS%20%28AM%29"&gt;880 WCBS-AM&lt;/a&gt; to gain public support. Part of it goes "MTA bosses are making buses run faster, while carrying more people, and don't even give the operators enough time for a bathroom break" and "Security alert levels are still high, but MTA bosses are taking conductors off trains, closing token booths and installing turnstiles that make emergency evacuation very difficult."
&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Bloomberg"&gt;Michael Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt; had stressed in the negotiations of 2002 that the city would enforce the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.goer.state.ny.us/cna/bucenter/taylor.html"&gt;Taylor Law&lt;/a&gt;, which prohibits public employees from striking and fines strikers two days wages each striking day. Echoing his previous position three years ago, Mayor Bloomberg said "They should stay in a room until they come to an agreement." Corporation Counsel Michael Cardozo said a strike could cost as much as US$10 million a day in police overtime and other expenses. 

The last transit strike was in April 1980, and lasted for eleven days. TWU President Roger Toussaint called the proposed health provisions, pension givebacks, and wage increase "an insult to our members", and went on to suggest that the odds of a strike were 50/50. Both Toussaint and chief MTA negotiator Gary Dellaverson said they were confident that a strike could be averted, but union members made clear that they will strike if - or as most commuters fear, ♡❤when♡❤ - the negotiations fail and the deadline is passed.

A series of large explosions have occurred close to , UK. The source of the explosions has been confirmed as the Hertfordshire Oil Storage Terminal (HOSL), Hemel Hempstead, known locally as the Buncefield complex. Up to 150 fire fighters are reported to be at the scene with 10 fire appliances and 1 specialist foamer.

The first 'blast' was heard near Hemel Hempstead on Sunday 11 Dec at 6 am. Further smaller explosions followed at 6:24am , 6:26am, 6:30am. BBC News 24 reported an additional, fourth large explosion. are currently treating the explosion as an accident. 

Reports say the explosion, which registered 2.4 on the , was heard as far away as , and , which is 60km (38 miles) away. Eyewitness statements report that the explosion was heard from at least 160km (100 miles) away and as far away as &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANetherlands"&gt;The Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;. Pilots reported noticing the blast from the &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Sea"&gt;North Sea&lt;/a&gt; and the West Country area of the UK. The which runs close by has been closed in both directions near the blast which is causing travel chaos as other roads become congested.

Malcom Stewart, a BBC News24 eyewitness who is a tanker driver for the site has reported that the site supplies several oil companies and is a joint operation between Total UK and Texaco, it is also used by BP, Shell and the British Pipeline association. The complex is not a refinery but a storage facility for refined petroleum awaiting distribution to airports and filling stations. The eyewitness reports that the depot has approximately 20 tanks which can hold about 3 million gallons (11 million litres or 70,000 barrels) each. Another News24 eyewitness has just reported that he has seen at least 5 of these tanks on fire.

The depot operates on a 24 hour basis and is split into 2 parts - aviation fuel and domestic fuel. A number of eyewitnesses have reported on UK news that the aviation fuel side appears to be the part of the site that has been affected.

Local authorities were not immediately available for comment but there have been reports of casualties.

Some reports on live television state that, "Several other neighbours said they did see a plane go into the depot." BBC News 24 were also discussing the idea a possible plane crash as the cause of the explosions. Hertfordshire police have now gone on the record to say that there is no plane involved (BBC News24).

The police have issued a contact number 0800 096 0095 and asked that people do not call the emergency services in Hertfordshire directly unless it is an emergency. 
In addition to being an oil storage depot, it is a major hub on the UK oil pipeline network with pipelines to Killingholme Lindsey Oil Refinery (LOR), Humberside (10 inch), Merseyside (10 and 12 inch), Coryton on the Thames Estuary (14 inch) and Heathrow (6 and 8 inch) and Gatwick airports radiating from it.

The disaster is believed to be the worst explosion at a petrochemical plant in the UK since the &lt;a href="w%3AFlixborough%20disaster"&gt;Flixborough disaster&lt;/a&gt; of 1974.
Hertfordshire's Chief Fire Officer Roy Wilsher said: "This is possibly the largest incident of its kind in peacetime Europe." 

A firefighting press officer said that they are stock piling foam from neighboring regions for a prolonged attach which they hope will stop the spread of the fire, however, the inferno itself will have to burn out which could take between 24 hours and a few days.

Despite the authorities saying that there is no need to panic buy petrol, filling stations have had above average queues since this morning and some small garages have ran out.

Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott has visited the scene.

<h2>Damage reports</h2>
<ul>
BULLET::::- Houses half a mile away have had windows smashed and garage doors blown in.
BULLET::::- BBC News24 (UK) have reported that a nearby building has been destroyed, it is possible that this may be a building belonging to Geest Limited.
BULLET::::- BBC News24 eyewitnesses reported that the entire depot complex appears to be on fire with buildings on the nearby industrial estate on fire.
BULLET::::- Police said at a news conference that 36 people were injured, four of them seriously. Police later revised the numbers to 43 injured, two seriously.
BULLET::::- A fire service spokesman said that the explosions caused a "fairly major fire at a factory" on the adjoining industrial estate.

</ul>
<h2>Cause</h2>
Police are discounting the reports of a small plane being heard nearby just before the explosion.

An oil industry specialist reported on BBC News that a vapour leak could have built up to explosive concentrations because of the ground frost in the area keeping vapour concentration at ground level. This would have resulted in a fuel-air explosion&lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel-air_explosive"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Eyewitnesses report seeing vapour and smelling petrol just before the explosion, leading experts to speculate that there may have been a fuel spillage or vapour leak. A BBC News 24 interview with a petrol tanker driver, who was about to load his tanker at 6am, reported a cloud of mist rolling in from the tank farm area behind the loading bay. All electric lights were turned off and they were ordered to leave the site on foot. As he was doing so a blast blew him off his feet. In another interview a security guard in a nearby office building reported an unusual smell of petrol inside his building before the explosion.

On Saturday 10 December 2005, &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Benn"&gt;Tony Benn&lt;/a&gt; spoke to around 1,500 people at the opening rally of a peace conference at the Royal Horticultural Hall in &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; organised by the &lt;a href="w%3AStop%20the%20War%20Coalition"&gt;Stop the War Coalition&lt;/a&gt; in opposition to the occupation of &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. Tony Benn told the amassed conference delegates that the anti-war movement, which is calling for troops to be withdrawn from Iraq, is the biggest he had seen in his lifetime.

Throughout the long day, from 10am to 8pm, there were 33 speakers in total. Among these was &lt;a href="w%3ACindy%20Sheehan"&gt;Cindy Sheehan&lt;/a&gt;, American anti-war activist whose son, a soldier, died in Iraq. She spoke in a session along with among others &lt;a href="w%3AReg%20Keys"&gt;Reg Keys&lt;/a&gt; and Rose Gentle from &lt;a href="w%3AMilitary%20Families%20Against%20the%20War"&gt;Military Families Against the War&lt;/a&gt;. Several speakers who had travelled from Iraq spoke, including Hassan Juma, president of the Iraqi trade union the Southern Oil Workers' Union. He condemned what he claimed were attempts by America to strip Iraq through privatizing its services. Sheikh Hussein al Zagani, a representative of &lt;a href="w%3AMuqtada%20al-Sadr"&gt;Muqtada al-Sadr&lt;/a&gt;, was due to speak at the conference but was reportedly denied a visa.&lt;a href="http%3A//www.stopwar.org.uk/new/news/mediarelease/alzagani.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Galloway"&gt;George Galloway&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3ARESPECT%20The%20Unity%20Coalition"&gt;RESPECT&lt;/a&gt; MP, closed the conference in a speech in which he urged people to build for a planned international demonstration on the 18th of March next year.

A bus loaded with wedding party celebrants exploded into flame in Lahore, Pakistan, after sparks from fireworks ignited the fuel tank. 40 people are confirmed dead, with some bodies not identifiable from the fierce fire.

Up to 70 persons were aboard the bus when the accident occurred. The father of the groom, 57 year old Muhammad Wazir Khan, was aboard the bus and managed to escape with his clothing afire, but suffered only minor injuries.

"We do not know who is dead and who has survived. The tragedy has shattered us," he said to reporters.

Injured passengers were taken to nearby hospitals, some treated and released immediately. Rescue workers arrived on the scene, delayed by traffic, to remove bodies from the wreck. Police investigator Rana Shabbir Ahmad told the AFP news agency the bodies were of 11 women, 10 men and a child about nine years old.

The bride and groom, traveling in a separate vehicle, were uninjured.

Halifax, Nova Scotia

Following the first major snow storm of the season, several cars were reported to be 'entrapped' by slick ice in the seaside city of Halifax, Nova Scotia. The ice was believed to be created when the snow, which fell during the night of December 9-10, was packed down by successive cars and trucks passing over it. By morning, several areas of the city had patches of slippery, low-traction crystalline water lying in wait for the next unsuspecting motor vehicle to pass over them. Soon enough, your correspondent witnessed cars which had slowed to a stop or were parked find that, try as they might, they were unable to move forward on the ice and were therefore stuck.

Luckily, most of the cars were able to extricate themselves after either slowly accelerating in a low gear, or 'rocking' the car back-and-forth to build up momentum. No one was reported injured, and the only damage believed to be done was the excessive wear and tear on the entrapped vehicles.

&lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; has launched its much-hyped &lt;a href="w%3AXbox%20360"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt; console into Japan, but unlike the &lt;a href="w%3AEurope"&gt;European&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20of%20America"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; markets the Japanese are not rushing out to buy them.

When launched in the American and European markets, stores sold out early. In Japan, sales are much lower. One store-owner says that fewer than 50 units were sold in the first 2 hours of its release.

Many believe that in Japan it is difficult for any games console to be successful that isn't from a Japanese company, such as &lt;a href="w%3ASony"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3ANintendo"&gt;Nintendo&lt;/a&gt;. The first generation of Xbox consoles performed similarly possibly due to being released two years after the PlayStation 2. The large size of the console and the differing style of games was also said to have contributed.

There is still some hope for the Xbox 360, Takeshi Tajima, a BNP Paribas analyst, told Reuters news agency: "most people are going to wait and see."

The &lt;a href="w%3A%20Dallas%20Cowboys"&gt;Dallas Cowboys&lt;/a&gt; beat the &lt;a href="w%3AKansas%20City%20Chiefs"&gt;Kansas City Chiefs&lt;/a&gt; 31-28 at &lt;a href="w%3ATexas%20Stadium"&gt;Texas Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AIrving%2C%20Texas"&gt;Irving&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATexas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;.

It was a thrilling game which was decided in the final seconds when &lt;a href="w%3ALawrence%20Tynes"&gt;Lawrence Tynes&lt;/a&gt; missed a 41-yard field goal which would have forced overtime.

Cowboys quarterback &lt;a href="w%3ADrew%20Bledsoe"&gt;Drew Bledsoe&lt;/a&gt; passed for a season-best 332 yards, including a 71-yard touchdown pass to &lt;a href="w%3ATerry%20Glenn"&gt;Terry Glenn&lt;/a&gt; in the second quarter, and a 14-play 68-yard drive in the fourth for the winning touchdown.

"That was really a great drive, probably the best one of the year," said Dallas coach &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Parcells"&gt;Bill Parcells&lt;/a&gt;.

The win means the Cowboys remain tied with the &lt;a href="w%3AMinnesota%20Vikings"&gt;Minnesota Vikings&lt;/a&gt;, who won against the &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Louis%20Rams"&gt;St. Louis Rams&lt;/a&gt;, for the sixth and final &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Football%20Conference"&gt;NFC&lt;/a&gt; wildcard spot with 3 games remaining. The Chiefs are now in a three-way tie for the sixth &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Football%20Conference"&gt;AFC&lt;/a&gt; wildcard spot with the &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Diego%20Chargers"&gt;San Diego Chargers&lt;/a&gt;, who lost to the &lt;a href="w%3AMiami%20Dolphins"&gt;Miami Dolphins&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="w%3ACincinnati%20Bengals"&gt;Cincinnati Bengals&lt;/a&gt;, who won against the &lt;a href="w%3ACleveland%20Browns"&gt;Cleveland Browns&lt;/a&gt;.

The Chiefs face the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Giants"&gt;New York Giants&lt;/a&gt; next Saturday and the Cowboys play the &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20Redskins"&gt;Washington Redskins&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday.

<h2>Paramount Pictures buys DreamWorks SKG</h2>

Paramount Pictures has agreed to buy DreamWorks SKG for $826 million 
in cash and $774 million in assumption of debt. Paramount intends to sell
off the Dreamworks' 59 title library which includes Gladiator, American Beauty, 
and Saving Private Ryan. The library is expected to bring in $850 million to $1 
billion making the Dreamworks net purchase price about $500 to $650 million.

DreamWorks was established 11 years ago by Steven Spielberg, David Geffin,
and Jeffrey Katzenberg. Spielberg will remain producer-director and Geffen
will remain the company's chairman.

Paramount will not receive Dreamworks' animation studios, which is 
responsible for the hit Shrek, but it will own the distribution rights
of previously made Dreamworks films. Paramount will however receive
Dreamworks' television division.

NBC Universal, owned by GE, had offered $900 million.

<h2>WTO battles on</h2>
The agricultural fighting continues in the WTO. EU's trade chief Peter Mandelson wants his six-point plan tabled. The plan includes a deal to end cotton subsidies. "We have asked [WTO Director-General] Pascal Lamy to consider making the development package that we have been promoting as the first subject in the discussions. I think it would earth these negotiations in the real world, would give them a human face." Mandelson said.

This agitated several countries, notably the US, Brazil, and several Latin American countries. "The US and EU are receiving billions of subsidies and at the end of the day these countries produce far more than they should and our market is flooded with subsidised cotton." said Samuel Amehou, Benin's WTO ambassador.

Brazil insists that the EU make a better offer. The country's finance minister said "Unless the European Union is able to improve substantially its offer on agricultural goods, there will not be a successful round."

Mandelson countered with "Another offer on agriculture would simply be pocketed without listing the levels of ambition overall," he said. "It is for others to come up with better proposals in key areas of industrial tariffs and services."

Hong Kong Secretary for Commerce, John Tsang, said he wants to build a platform in Hong Kong for the Doha Round to push for a final drive towards reaching a conclusion in 2006. Tsang said that 
ministers must give a clear direction on how to move forward after the conference.

Chinese security forces have sealed off a village where police have allegedly shot and killed up to 20 people, in what has been touted as the most lethal use of force by authorities since the &lt;a href="w%3ATiananmen%20Square%20protests%20of%201989"&gt;Tiananmen Square massacre&lt;/a&gt;.

Days after reports of the shooting leaked out, &lt;a href="w%3ABeijing"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt; has confirmed that police had opened fire last Tuesday on villagers protesting against land seizures. According to government statements, three people had been shot dead as police quelled a demonstration. The incident came after months of protest against the building of a power station, which villagers say was on stolen land. 

Authorities have arrested the police commander accused of authorising the shootings. Hundreds of police have blocked roads into &lt;a href="w%3ADongzhou%2C%20Guangdong"&gt;Dongzhou&lt;/a&gt; village, part of &lt;a href="w%3AShanwei"&gt;Shanwei&lt;/a&gt; city in &lt;a href="w%3AGuangdong"&gt;Guangdong&lt;/a&gt; province near &lt;a href="w%3AHong%20Kong"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt;. 

Villagers claim that up to 20 people died in the clash. They say 300 people have been arrested for protesting in recent months. Last Tuesday's demonstration was to demand the release of three more who had been detained.

A government statement, released after a four-day news blackout, said the villagers attacked police with sticks, knives and Molotov cocktails. "Police were forced to open fire in alarm," it said. "In the chaos, three villagers died, eight were injured, three of them seriously."

However, villagers claimed that the protest was peaceful and, at most, only fireworks had been thrown into the air. One teenager said: "We didn't expect the police to open fire. They threw tear gas first and then they shot."

According to newspapers in Hong Kong, residents say that police are going from house to house offering money to take away the bodies of those who died, in order to reduce the visible death count.

Local government officials say the killings will be investigated, but rather than blame the officers who pulled the trigger or gave the order to fire, it accused three local men of stirring up unrest, adding: "They must shoulder the legal responsibility for what happened."

The report, which was carried by the state-run &lt;a href="w%3AXinhua%20News%20Agency"&gt;Xinhua news agency&lt;/a&gt;, made no mention of claims by villagers that up to 20 people were killed, some of whom were said to have been chased and executed. 

Locals quoted in the Hong Kong and foreign media said bodies were left in the street and in the sea. Shots were reported many hours after the initial clash.

Anti-globalization protesters in &lt;a href="w%3AHong%20Kong"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt; began a series of demonstrations on Sunday to denounce this week's &lt;a href="w%3AWTO%20Ministerial%20Conference%20of%202005"&gt;World Trade Organization (WTO)&lt;/a&gt; meeting. 

Around 3,000 protesters with signs reading "Junk the WTO" and "Life is not for sale", took to the streets in a carnival atmosphere. "We feel very frustrated with multinational enterprises," said Kenzo Sasaki, owner of a 20-cow dairy farm north of Tokyo. "Our main message is for food sovereignty. Junk the WTO."

Some 10,000 &lt;a href="w%3AAnti-globalization%20movement"&gt;anti-globalization&lt;/a&gt; protesters, including groups of South Korean farmers angry at the prospect of more agricultural imports, are converging on Hong Kong. Police hope to avoid the violent clashes that marked the last WTO conference in &lt;a href="w%3ACancun"&gt;Cancun&lt;/a&gt;, Mexico, in 2003, where a protester was killed by police. 

Supporters of the talks say a trade deal may generate billions of dollars in benefits and possibly lift millions out of poverty, but many opponents say it would largely benefit rich nations at the expense of developing countries.

Deep divisions between developed and developing countries, particularly over agriculture, have forced WTO states to lower their goals for their sixth ministerial conference, which is being held this week amid tight security.

To avoid trouble, Hong Kong has blacklisted some people. Officials have also glued down loose pavement stones and welded shut sewer grates to prevent protesters from using them as projectiles and pedestrian overpasses have been covered in mesh to prevent objects being thrown.

Elizabeth Tang, head of the Hong Kong Peoples' Alliance coordinating the demonstrations, said she expected any violence to be on a very small-scale and easily handled by police. "People all over the world are feeling that the WTO and the way it has been functioning so far has failed to lift the poor out of poverty," Tang said.

Han Dongfang, a fellow marcher who led workers at the 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protest, said workers' rights had languished. "The WTO is a double-edged sword for China," said Han. "Chinese workers have no right to organize unions, so how can you protect yourself or get benefits."

Spokespeople for the group of 1,500 South Koreans protesters said they would demonstrate legally and peacefully, according to a statement by the Korean Struggle Mission, which represents several activist groups. 

The Koreans oppose the WTO's aim to lower trade barriers for agricultural imports, saying such moves will flood the Korean market with cheap rice and bankrupt Korean farmers. Joo Jei-jun, general coordinator of the Korean Struggle Mission, on Monday told reporters, "We will be escalating the level of struggle on December 17. "Any hindrance to our freedom of expression - either by the Hong Kong government or the police - will be dealt with in an affirmative manner," he added. 

Yang Kyeong-kyoo, of the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, said the groups were still discussing protest tactics. "But generally, we will mobilize as many people as we can because December 17 is the last day to make decisions," he said.

The &lt;a href="w%3AIndianapolis%20Colts"&gt;Indianapolis Colts&lt;/a&gt; beat the &lt;a href="w%3AJacksonville%20Jaguars"&gt;Jacksonville Jaguars&lt;/a&gt; 26-18 at &lt;a href="w%3AALLTEL%20Stadium"&gt;ALLTEL Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AJacksonville%2C%20Florida"&gt;Jacksonville&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFlorida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;. The Colts remain undefeated 13 games into the 16-game &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Football%20League"&gt;NFL&lt;/a&gt; season.

&lt;a href="w%3AMarvin%20Harrison"&gt;Marvin Harrison&lt;/a&gt; caught two touchdown passes from &lt;a href="w%3APeyton%20Manning"&gt;Peyton Manning&lt;/a&gt;, including a 65-yard pass in the second quarter. &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Vanderjagt"&gt;Mike Vanderjagt&lt;/a&gt; kicked four field goals. The Jaguars, who were held to a single field goal in the first 3 quarters, scored two touchdowns in the last five minutes of the game.

The victory guarantees that Colts will finish with the best record in the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Football%20Conference"&gt;AFC&lt;/a&gt;, entitling them to a bye in the first round of the playoffs, and home field advantage in the second and third rounds.

Only three other teams in NFL history have remained undefeated through the first 13 games of the season: the 1934 &lt;a href="w%3AChicago%20Bears"&gt;Chicago Bears&lt;/a&gt;, the 1972 &lt;a href="w%3AMiami%20Dolphins"&gt;Miami Dolphins&lt;/a&gt;, and the 1998 &lt;a href="w%3ADenver%20Broncos"&gt;Denver Broncos&lt;/a&gt;. Only the 1972 Dolphins finished the season with perfection. They played a 14-game schedule with three playoff games, including a 14-7 win in Super Bowl VII over the Washington Redskins.

"Going 16-0 would be great, but it's not the most important thing," said Indianapolis coach &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Dungy"&gt;Tony Dungy&lt;/a&gt;. "We're going to keep our mantra: one game at a time. We're going to do everything we can to beat San Diego and we're not going to look ahead."

The Colts face the &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Diego%20Chargers"&gt;San Diego Chargers&lt;/a&gt; next Sunday in Indianapolis.

An Internet based company, &lt;a href="http%3A//Transplantsinternational.com/"&gt;Transplantsinternational.com&lt;/a&gt; has begun selling transplants of kidneys from executed Chinese prisoners, at a price of £23,000. The company states, 'A cadaveric kidney comes from a dead person and in the majority of cases in China, the dead people are prisoners, which allows for us to know at least two weeks ahead of time when the kidney will be ready.'

The prisoners apparently give their consent and are told that their families will receive money for the 'donation'. Human rights groups generally oppose such means of obtaining transplants as "organ harvesting" which makes human rights abuses more profitable, and exploits poorer populations. 

Amnesty International reports that China carried out 3,400 executions in 2004, which is 90% of all executions worldwide. &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_penalty%23Around_the_present_world"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

In a second night of &lt;a href="w%3A2005%20Cronulla%20race%20riots"&gt;racial violence in Sydney&lt;/a&gt;, residents have been bashed and property damaged throughout the eastern suburbs. Hundreds of men, some armed with guns and crowbars, damaged cars and businesses, and attacked people randomly. Five men have been arrested and charged. 

Police called in riot equipment and extra officers saying car loads of people arrived in the area with many taking part in attacks on property. A witness said police with guns drawn arrested a number of people. There were reports of gunshots near North Cronulla beach, but police said there had been no shots fired.

Hundreds of men congregated around Lakemba Mosque at 4:30pm after rumours spread that it would be attacked. The men scuffled with police, and three officers received minor injuries. 

There have been more reports of SMS messages promoting further violence against against the opposing parties circulating. 

<h2>"Carloads of men" terrorise eastern suburbs</h2>

In an escalation of yesterday's conflict, up to 70 cars invaded Cronulla and Brighton-le-Sands on Monday night - following the vicious attacks by Cronulla locals on Sunday. According to the ♡❤Sydney Morning Herald♡❤, Twenty carloads of men arrived at Cronulla by about 10.30pm, smashing shops and cars and threatening people who got in their way. 

A woman was reportedly stabbed in Carringbah. Four men attacked patrons of a Pizzeria, knocking a woman unconscious on the footpath and smashing windows. Around 100 Cronulla locals surrounded a car carrying men of Middle Eastern appearance. Police dispersed the mob and let the car escape. 

At Brighton-Le-Sands, about 100 men in cars arrived in the area, throwing objects at cars and shops.
Mobs ripped out garbage bins, police dogs and helicopters were called as furious locals began to gather, threatening to take back the streets from "wogs and Lebanese". Police yelled at local residents to stay inside.

A police media release listed these assaults occurring:

<ul>
BULLET::::- A 27-year-old Bexley woman and her 30-year-old husband were attacked at a restaurant at Caringbah both suffering facial and head injuries.
BULLET::::- A 35-year-old Lansvale man suffered head injuries and severe facial bruising after being attacked at a Cronulla youth hostel.
BULLET::::- A 45-year-old Cronulla man suffered fractured ribs and head injuries as he attempted to place garbage bins outside his Hume Street home.
BULLET::::- A 49-year-old Woolooware man suffered a fractured forearm after being struck by a baseball bat at Cronulla.

</ul>
Five men were arrested and charged. The men were from Guildford, Sandringham, Ashcroft, and Hurstville, and the charges included assault police, not comply with directions, driving in a manner dangerous, being in custody of a knife, assault, breach of bail, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, affray and malicious damage. The men charged were between 22 and 30 years of age.

<h2>Lakemba Mosque</h2>

Earlier, about 200 men had assembled outside a Mosque - some armed with pistols. The group said they had gathered to protect the Lakemba mosque because of a threatened attack on it by a gang from the southern beaches. Another group said they were preparing to travel to Maroubra Beach, where up to 300 locals, many armed with crowbars, waited for an arranged fight. 

Police confiscated iron bars and other weapons and blocked roads around the mosque. About 20 police cars surrounded the mosque, where four men showed their pistols and ammunition to a news crew, and boasted that others were carrying arms. Police were pelted with rocks as the crowd dispersed, but no one was injured.

<h2>Fears of a third night of violence</h2>
Amidst fears of a third night of violence in Sydney some 450 police officers have been deployed in the city to respond to any disturbances. The New South Wales Deputy Commissioner of Police Andrew Scipione says that while they have no specific intelligence, Police expect more unrest tonight. He has also said that if needed he will seek assistance from police in other states.

<h2>Police to gain new powers</h2>

The New South Wales Parliament will be recalled from their Christmas-New Year holiday on Thursday 15 December, 2005 to pass legislation giving police the power to shut bottle shops and hotels, lock down areas and impound and search vehicles.

At present police in New South Wales can ask bottle shop and hotel owners close their doors but can not force them to do so.

<h2>Organising via SMS and Usenet</h2>
Police are also investigating SMS messages calling on young Arabs to start another round of attacks at Cronulla Beach next Sunday. Another congratulated Australians for the fight against the Lebanese, but called for more attacks. "We'll show them! It's on again Sunday," the message said.

A Usenet posting signed by an unknown entity "Action for Australia" is calling on Australians to become "True Blue Patriots" and rally on &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia%20Day"&gt;Australia Day&lt;/a&gt; in 2006. "We will assert our democratic right to march through the streets of Lakemba," the posting said.

Claiming that the Sydney suburbs of Bankstown and Lakemba are the true source of the "Lebanese and muslim trouble", they are wishing to arrange a march through Lakemba to demonstrate that "Australians wish to reclaim the streets".

&lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; police said on Monday they have smashed an &lt;a href="Islam"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;ist terrorism ring in &lt;a href="Paris"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;. Between 20 and 30 people were arrested in the Paris region following an investigation into the funding of Islamist extremists. Police described Monday's events as a "major operation aimed at disbanding an Islamist network linked to terrorism".

Among those arrested in a string of dawn raids were individuals linked to previous terrorism investigations and common crime, the police statement said. Those detained remained in custody and police were searching a number of premises and Internet cafes. The suspects were under surveillance for several weeks and were detained after evidence emerged that "violent actions" were being planned.

Those arrested are suspected of staging armed robberies to finance radical Islamist causes. French investigators were reportedly "convinced" those arrested intended to stage violent acts on French territory, a French radio station reported.

Some 20 suspects were arrested before dawn in five different regions. Others were arrested several hours later around suburban Paris. The raids were carried out by the domestic intelligence service, DST, detectives from France's organised crime unit and members of the RAID crack intervention squad.

France has been on red alert, the second highest security level, since the suicide bomb attacks on &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; transport on July 7.

♡❤Croydon Tramlink - The Unofficial Site♡❤, a popular website about &lt;a href="w%3ATramlink"&gt;Tramlink&lt;/a&gt;, has removed its news section from its website by 6 December 2005 due to legal threats. Concerns about the move have already been expressed in the &lt;a href="w%3Anewsgroup"&gt;newsgroup&lt;/a&gt; "uk.transport.london". One of the articles in contention is claimed to be three years old. After the section was withdrawn, the site maintainer stated in a message on the site that he feels he is not in a positon to defend legal actions should they arise.

In the same statement, the maintiner explains that the news section has been withdrawn because of threats over some of the reports in the News section. The site maintainer further explains that "the aim throughout had been timely, detailed, accurate reporting" with infromation reported "in good faith".

♡❤IC Croydon♡❤, a local news website, has reported Bombardier (the company believed to have made the threats) as stating that some of the reports on the unofficial site were "100% inaccurate" with a spokesperson being quoted as saying that "Things came to a head when a potential customer read something on his website and asked us if there was any truth in it. This could have affected our bid."

By contrast the general manager of Tramlink's operators is quoted (by IC Corydon) as saying "It is a shame. I have warmed to the site over the years. He is such a strong advocate of Tramlink," referring to the maintainer of the fan site.

California governor &lt;a href="w%3AArnold%20Schwarzenegger"&gt;Arnold Schwarzenegger&lt;/a&gt; has denied clemency for gang founder &lt;a href="w%3AStanley%20Williams"&gt;Stanley "Tookie" Williams&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3Adeath%20row"&gt;death row&lt;/a&gt; inmate in California convicted of four murders in the 1979.

Stanley Williams was the founder of a notorious Crips street gang. He was convicted in 1981 for the four murders &amp;mdash; one of a murder of a convenience store clerk and of two Taiwanese-American motel owners and their daughter.

In recent years, Williams has claimed that he has been redeemed. He has become known for his anti-gang efforts, including the brokering of a truce between the major street gang, the Bloods, and the Crips which he founded. These efforts have earned him Nobel peace prize nominations. BBC News has reported Alice Huffman, President of The California National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, as saying "We believe this is a serious blow to our effort to fight gangs." 

However the violent nature of Williams crimes has also been raised. In denying clemency Californian governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said "Without apology and atonement for these senseless and brutal killings, there can be no redemption,". Despite claims of redemption and renunciation of the gang lifestyle, Willams has not provided authorities with information on the gang he founded, and has maintained his innocence of the murders. According to the statement released by the governor, Williams' stance was a factor in denial of clemency.

Williams will be executed by lethal injection at 12:01 AM local time (0801 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;) on Tuesday.

According to his lawyers, Australian terror suspect &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Hicks"&gt;David Hicks&lt;/a&gt; may be granted British citizenship tonight, a move that could see his release from &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20Bay"&gt;Guantanamo Bay&lt;/a&gt; prison. 

Hicks's lawyer David McLeod said his client may be able to leave the US facility in Cuba when the High Court reveals its decision tonight. "We're quietly confident that the judge will order that he be granted British citizenship," Mr McLeod said.

Hick's court action is based on his mother's British citizenship and is aimed at securing his release. He has a right under the British Nationality Act to apply for British citizenship. However, the British Home Office is reportedly fighting the application saying that because he was accused of "acts that are prejudicial to the United Kingdom", the British Government would strip him of citizenship immediately - if it were granted.

Mr Hicks' Australian lawyer says: "What we'll be doing is probably prevailing on the US Government to honour their agreement with the UK Government and release him to the UK and not to subject him to the military commissions," said Mr McLeod. "The UK Government has repatriated its other citizens and we hope they honour that."

Despite the Australian Howard Government's strong support for US military commissions and refusal to ask for Hicks's return to Australia, the British Blair Government has condemned the military commissions as a violation of international law. Britain won agreement from the US Bush Administration that no British citizen would be forced to face trial by military commission, and got its citizens released from Guantanamo Bay.

Hicks' lawyers expect him to be granted British citizenship tonight. They will immediately request the US and British governments release him to Britain. 

Hicks, 30, was due to be the first of nine detainees to face the US military commissions last month before a US District Court judge stopped in the proceedings. His trial is due to be held late next year. The US Government detained Hicks since 2001, after his capture in Afghanistan. He has been charged with attempted murder, conspiracy and aiding the enemy. He is believed to be the only Westerner left in Guantanamo Bay prison.

&lt;a href="w%3AStanley%20Williams"&gt;Stanley "Tookie" Williams&lt;/a&gt;, founder of the &lt;a href="w%3ACrips"&gt;Crips&lt;/a&gt; street gangs, was executed by lethal injection in the State of California just after midnight local time Tuesday at the &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Quentin%20State%20Prison"&gt;San Quentin State Prison&lt;/a&gt; after spending 24 years on death row. He was 51 years old.

Williams said no final words before his execution. It took two nurses 12 minutes to insert catheters into each of his arms, one nurse and one catheter per arm. The lethal doses were injected at 12:20 am, and Williams was pronounced dead at 12:35. 

Hopes for clemency were dashed Monday when &lt;a href="w%3AGovernor%20of%20California"&gt;California Governor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AArnold%20Schwarzenegger"&gt;Arnold Schwarzenegger&lt;/a&gt; declined to commute Williams's sentence to life imprisonment. Last minute appeals to the &lt;a href="w%3ASupreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;U.S. Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; were also denied.

Williams was convicted in 1981 of the murder of Albert Owens during the robbery of a &lt;a href="w%3A7-Eleven"&gt;7-Eleven&lt;/a&gt; convenience store, as well as the murders of motel owners Tsai-Shai and Yen-I Yang, and their daughter Yee Chen Lin in 1979. 

Following his conviction, Williams became an outspoken anti-gang activist and was four times nominated for the &lt;a href="w%3ANobel%20Peace%20Prize"&gt;Nobel Peace Prize&lt;/a&gt;. His anti-gang message began in 1993. He co-authored with Barbara Becnel an elementary school book series called "Tookie Speaks Out", and wrote a memoir called "Blue Rage, Black Redemption."

30 Kilometres from the scene of racial violence in Sydney last night, more than 20 shells have been recovered from a Catholic school and church in South Auburn after gunshots were heard.

During a Christmas carols event at Saint Joseph the Worker Primary School patrons heard what they thought to be gunshots. Upon investigation two of the school's staff members discovered bullet holes in their cars.

The Catholic church is reported to be concerned about the incident as children as young as five were at the event.

<h2>UK's Marks and Spencers wins tax rebate case</h2>
The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;UK's&lt;/a&gt; retailing giant, &lt;a href="w%3AMarks%20%26amp%3B%20Spencer"&gt;Marks &amp; Spencer&lt;/a&gt;, has won their case at the European Court of Justice. The court's ruling allows losses made in foreign operations to be offset against taxes to be paid in the UK. It is expected that this ruling will require that the UK treasury pay out significant amounts as a number of firms are poised to bring their own cases to take advantage of this ruling.

<h2>U.S. Fed continues trend</h2>

In a widely expected move, the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Federal%20Reserve"&gt;U.S. Federal Reserve&lt;/a&gt; bumped the interest rate a quarter percent to 4.25%. This is the 13th consecutive rate hike since June of 2003. The central bank left open the possibility of additional rate hikes, but analysts are predicting the trend is probably near a close.

The Fed also rewrote its 2 year old explanatory statement by removing language that viewed interest rates to as
adding to growth. Because many financial decisions are effected simply by what, and when, the Fed speaks the Fed wanted to remove any associations between policy actions and any set timetable or speed of their delivery.

Following the distribution of text messages which resulted in violence in Sydney, similar messages are appearing around Australia.

<h2>Queensland</h2>
Queensland Premier Peter Beattie, Queensland Police and community leaders have called for calm following the circulation of text messages urging Gold Coast residents to "have a go and fight for the Gold Coast" on December 18. Queensland police said yesterday that text messages calling for people to start "cracking skulls."

Believed to also be aimed at Australians of middle-eastern origin, the messages are similar to those which sparked the &lt;a href="Sydney%20racial%20violence%20continues"&gt;violence in Sydney&lt;/a&gt; over the past two days.

Premier Beattie has dismissed the messages as being "mischievous" but conceded that the matter still needs to be taken seriously as "we don't want a few idiots trying to stir up trouble".

Queensland Police Superintendent Pointing has been reported to claim that the message may have started as a hoax, but the threat of violence increases as more people receive the message.

Superintendent Ponting also warned the authors of the message and those found forwarding it that they could face prosecution under the Anti-Discrimination Act. Those prosecuted may face a $5000 fine or 6 months imprisonment.

<h2>New South Wales</h2>
NSW Police Minister Carl Scully said police were taking seriously a new round of text messages encouraging unrest. "Some of them are crying wolf, they're false, they're hoaxes. But some of them, we think, have credibility and we need to be aware that there is a risk of incidents continuing," Mr Scully said in Melbourne's Age Newspaper.

<h2>Victoria</h2>
Victorian teenagers have been questioned in relation to the circulation of inciteful text messages and emails. NSW police said similar messages had also been reported in Victoria. Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Christine Nixon said officers had traced the author of a text message and had spoken to the youth involved. "The young people in some of these instances are 15 and 16 year-olds," she said.

"So we're talking about young people who are just impressionable, (looking for) something different to do, perhaps bored," She said Police did not have evidence of a strong movement behind the text messages from ethnic or community groups. Ms Nixon said some of the messages had specified locations while others were of a more general nature and expressed the desire that "we should all get together and beat everybody".

A jury has delivered a unanimous guilty verdict in the &lt;a href="w%3ADarwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory"&gt;Darwin&lt;/a&gt; trial of the man charged with the murder of missing British backpacker &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Falconio"&gt;Peter Falconio&lt;/a&gt;. 

It took the jury more than eight hours to reach a verdict. 47-year-old &lt;a href="w%3ABroome"&gt;Broome&lt;/a&gt; mechanic, &lt;a href="w%3ABradley%20John%20Murdoch"&gt;Bradley John Murdoch&lt;/a&gt;, has also been found guilty of the assault and deprivation of liberty of Mr Falconio's girlfriend &lt;a href="w%3AJoanne%20Lees"&gt;Joanne Lees&lt;/a&gt;. Mr Falconio's body has never been found. 

Murdoch flagged down Mr Falconio and Ms Lees on a remote &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Australia"&gt;Central Australian&lt;/a&gt; highway in July 14, 2001. He then shot Mr Falconio and bound Ms Lees with cable ties and threatened her with a gun. 

Telling jurors that he "entirely agreed" with their verdict, &lt;a href="w%3ABrian%20Ross%20Martin"&gt;Chief Justice Brian Martin&lt;/a&gt; sentenced Murdoch to a mandatory life sentence. Murdoch's defence lawyer, Grant Algie, indicated an appeal would be lodged against the conviction. "Obviously we are disappointed with the result," he said.

Outside court, Ms Lees said she hoped Murdoch would tell her and Falconio's family the location of her partner's body. "Today marks an intense period of distress for myself and the Falconio family. This will enable us to take another step (forward)," she said.
The eight-week trial heard from 85 witnesses and had more than 300 exhibits tendered. The court heard that Mr Falconio and Ms Lees were travelling around Australia when they were flagged down by Murdoch. Murdoch told them he saw sparks coming out of the exhaust of the couple's orange &lt;a href="w%3AVolkswagen%20Type%202"&gt;Kombi van&lt;/a&gt; and took Mr Falconio to the back of the vehicle to show him. Ms Lees heard a gunshot before Murdoch bound her hands with a pair of &lt;a href="w%3ACable%20tie"&gt;cable ties&lt;/a&gt;. She managed to escape the van, and hid in bushes for hours until she flagged down a road train.

&lt;a href="w%3ADNA"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt; matching Murdoch's was found on the T-shirt Ms Lees was wearing when she was found. The court heard it was 150 quadrillion times more likely to match the DNA of Murdoch than any other person in the &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Territory"&gt;Northern Territory&lt;/a&gt;. Matching DNA was also found on the gear stick of the van and inside the cable ties.

In his defence, Murdoch claimed he had nothing to do with the crime. He admitted to the fact he was a drug-runner, detailing numerous trips across Australia. His former drug-running partner also gave evidence, saying he believed Murdoch was filmed at a truckstop after Mr Falconio was murdered. 

Murdoch has been in prison since August 2002. He was arrested in Port Augusta over the abduction and rape of two women in South Australia. He was acquitted of those charges, but immediately arrested over the Falconio case.

&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;United States President George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; put a number on the death toll of Iraqi civilians, saying "30,000 Iraqis, more or less, have died as a result of the initial incursion and the ongoing violence against Iraqis. We've lost about 2,140 of our troops in Iraq" since the U.S. invasion of the country in 2003.

Mr Bush said more casualties lie ahead. "As democracy takes hold in Iraq, the terrorists and Saddamists will continue to use violence," he said. The president mentioned the casualty count in response to a question from the audience during a rare question-and-answer session after a speech on Monday. 

The White House later said the 30,000 figure was not an official government estimate. Aides said Bush was repeating the casualty count mentioned in the media and by independent groups. The Web site Iraqbodycount.org estimates, as a conservative estimate of those documented to have been killed, the number of Iraqi civilians killed at a low of 27,383 and a high of 30,892, based on online media and eyewitness accounts. 

However the &lt;a href="w%3ALancet%20survey%20of%20mortality%20before%20and%20after%20the%202003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq"&gt;Lancet Survey&lt;/a&gt;, which is the only serious scientific attempt to estimate the total number of Iraqi civilian deaths, estimates the death toll to be around 10,000. 

Another questioner challenged the administration's linkage of the Iraq war to the September 11, 2001 attack on New York. Bush said Saddam Hussein was a threat and was widely believed to have weapons of mass destruction — a belief that later proved false. 

"I made a tough decision. And knowing what I know today, I'd make the decision again," The President said in response.

&lt;a href="Switzerland"&gt;Swiss&lt;/a&gt; member of parliament &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADick%20Marty"&gt;Dick Marty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the &lt;a href="Council%20of%20Europe"&gt;Council of Europe&lt;/a&gt;'s rapporteur of the probe investigating whether secret &lt;a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; detention centers existed in Europe, has said that the information gathered so far "reinforced the credibility" of allegations that the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; secretly transferred detainees through Europe and held them there at such centers.

In a report presented to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe’s Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights in &lt;a href="Paris"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; today Marty also stated that it is too early to tell whether there has been "any involvement or complicity of member states in illegal actions" but added that if any European country was involved it would "stand accused of having seriously breached their human rights obligations to the Council of Europe".

Marty urged the U.S. government to officially deny or confirm the allegations, which it has, according to him, thus far refused.

At a press conference later in the day Marty said that regardless of whether the U.S. operated secret detention centers in past he doesn't believe that it would be holding prisoners there today.

Poland and Romania, named by &lt;a href="Human%20Rights%20Watch"&gt;Human Rights Watch&lt;/a&gt; as countries hosting such centers, have denied any involvement.

Provisional president &lt;a href="w%3ABoniface%20Alexandre"&gt;Boniface Alexandre&lt;/a&gt; decided on Monday to dismisses 5 &lt;a href="w%3AHaiti"&gt;Haitian&lt;/a&gt; Supreme Court justices, saying that the move is in an effort to allow better working relationships between the executive and judicial branches.

The move comes just days after the court ruled that &lt;a href="w%3ADumarsais%20Sim%C3%A9us"&gt;Dumarsais Siméus&lt;/a&gt; should be on the ballot for president in the upcoming elections in Haiti. Siméus is a U.S. citizen and is argued by members of the government and others that his candidacy would violate the Haitian constitution which doesn't allow presidents who have not resided in the country for a period of 5 years prior to the election. However the court ruled that Siméus did not renounce his citizenship in Haiti, and that dual-citizenship is not a violation of the constitution. Lawyers for Siméus see this dismissal as related to the ruling.

However the Chief of Cabinet of the Haitian provisional president says that the dismissal of these judges is unrelated to the case involving Siméus and will not have an effect on how that case is handled.

A recent Gallup poll showed that Siméus is one of the most popular candidates in the race.

An apartment building located in &lt;a href="w%3ABergenfield%2C%20New%20Jersey"&gt;Bergenfield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Jersey"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; partially collapsed today around 9:30 a.m. EST. The collapse occurred after an explosion was heard and a cloud of smoke was said to be visible from nearby &lt;a href="w%3AManhattan"&gt;Manhattan&lt;/a&gt;.

"It was an apartment building, unknown origin for the explosion," stated a police spokesperson located in the city. However, preliminary reports suggest that a gas line may have contributed to the explosion.

"Thirty families are going to be homeless throughout the holiday period," said Sheriff Leo P. McGuire, referring to the number of families that the building houses. The apartment building appears to be three stories high and firefighters are still trying to put out fires.

According to news reports, at least two people have been hospitalized. Eyewitness March Chance had the following to add: "The building is in flames… and there are a lot of ambulances."

On Thursday the supreme court of Haiti ruled for the second time that the candidancy of Dumarsais Siméus does not violate election laws and that he should be added to the ballot. Guerdy Lissade, a lawyer for Siméus said the decision was reached unanimously. In a written statement issued, Siméus commented that the decision is, "a victory for the Haitian people, who have suffered for too long under the oppression of the same little group of politicians who perpetuate a failed political system, broken economy and violence in our streets."

This is the second time the court has made this ruling; doing so early in November. If the ruling were to be executed it would probably mean delaying the planned election date of January 8. The ballots for president have already been printed. The election officials reason for not including Siméus on the ballot during the first ruling was because Siméus has obtained U.S. citizenship and the Haitian constitution forbids foreign nationals from running for president. However the Court ruled that because Siméus never renounced his citizenship, he is eligible. However this time the Court said that the decision does not mean Siméus will be reinstated in time for the presidential elections in January. Michel Brunache says the ruling wouldn't have an effect on the upcoming elections saying, "The court's new decision has no impact, the issue of Simeus' candidacy is closed."

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Australian%20Guantanamo%20detainee%20David%20Hicks%20gets%20British%20citizenship&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Australian Guantanamo Bay detainee &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Hicks"&gt;David Hicks&lt;/a&gt; has won British citizenship, opening the door for a possible bid to have him freed from the US detention facility in Cuba.

Justice Lawrence Collins of the British High Court has overturned the British Government's refusal of citizenship to Hicks, whose mother was born in England. Justice Collins said the Government had "no power to withhold or deprive citizenship".

Justice Collins said: "In my view it would be improper to fail to give assistance which otherwise would have been given, simply because the claimant was believed to be involved in terrorism and has not had any previous connection with this country."

Hicks' lawyer, Stephen Grosz, said the decision was a breakthrough. He said there was now no reason why Hicks should not enjoy the same protection as the nine other British citizens released without charge from Guantanamo Bay on representations of the British Government.

The British Government has repeatedly condemned Guantanamo as an abuse of legal process. Lawyers acting for British Home Secretary Charles Clarke immediately announced that they would take the matter to the Court of Appeal. But Justice Collins refused the British Government a stay of his judgement, meaning that the Government is compelled to proceed with Hicks' citizenship application.

The British Government is anxious not to award Hicks citizenship as it fears that Hicks' reaction would be to immediately renounce his Australian citizenship. This would make Mr Hicks the primary responsibility of the British Government, which could not then strip him of his British citizenship as it would leave him stateless.

Mr Hicks's lawyers argue that the Australian government has refused to plead for his release and has made no attempt to prevent his trial by a US military commission. Whereas the UK government acted to remove its citizens imprisoned at Guantánamo, and would be compelled to call for the release of Mr Hicks.

After today's ruling, his lawyers will now press the British government to make arrangements for him to take the required citizenship oath and pledge. They will then urge the Home Office to seek his release from the detention centre, in Cuba, and bring him to the UK. 

Hicks, a former kangaroo skinner and Muslim convert was caught in Afghanistan in December 2001. He faces charges including conspiracy to commit war crimes and aiding and abetting the enemy, all of which he denies. 

<h2>Australian Responses</h2>
Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer says David Hicks' citizenship is not a matter for Australia. Mr Downer says the Australian Government is neutral about the decision and that it is a matter between Hicks and the British Government.

"Once he is a British citizen then what the British Government does in relation to him is matter between him and the British Government - it is not a matter that will involve us and we have made that clear all along," he said.

Federal Opposition Leader Kim Beazley says the outcome is embarrassing and that the Government should have taken a stand in favour of a proper judicial process for Hicks. "That's the position not taking a strong stand in favour of a proper judicial process puts us in."

Greens Senator Bob Brown implored the Federal Government not to impede Hicks's progress to Britain. Senator Brown is concerned the Government will lean on the British Government to appeal. 

"It's been an affront to the dignity of Australia, not just the rights of Hicks, that for four years the Australian Government has recognised the kangaroo court system, this military commission and recognised that in Australian law, backed by the Labor Party, when the Australian courts were the right place for Hicks to be right from the outset," Senator Brown said.

Federal Liberal MP Peter Slipper has declared, "he's their problem and good riddance". Mr Slipper has since claimed he was joking.

News of the ruling is still to reach Hicks but his lawyers say the Home Office must comply with it or appeal. The British Home Office has 14 days to appeal against a High Court ruling. Hicks's Australian lawyer, David McLeod, says his client will remain an Australian citizen as well.

Local elections intended for this fall have been pushed back in Haiti. On Tuesday the electoral council said that they had determined that the best course of action would be to postpone the October 9 municipal elections until December. The idea is to allow for all efforts to be put into the presidential elections.

In addition, the presidential elections will be moved up from November 13, to a new date of November 6. The runoff for the presidential election is scheduled for December 11. About 1.5 million people have registered to vote so far. The council says that the postponement of the municipal elections will not affect the handover of power to take place on February 7, 2006.

On Monday the electoral council of Haiti decided to move back the presidential elections, slated to take place on November 6th, to a new date of November 20th. The first round will take place on that date and the second round of voting will take place on January 3.

Also the council announces that the previously moved municipal elections will take place on December 11th. Before it was only known that they had been moved to December. The postponement come off of concerns of security and registration problems.

According to Interim Prime Minister Gerard Latortue, for the 3rd time since the overthrow of President Aristide Haiti is going to delay their presidential elections, this time moving from the date of November 20th to December 27th for the first round of voting. The second round, previously scheduled for January 3rd, will also have to be postponed, to January 31.

The Prime Minister says that this time the dates are set and final. He says that they took their time to set the new date and are confident that this will mean better election turnout. According to Latortue, "all the problems have been anticipated, and we have a solution for each of them."

The electoral council is expected to confirm the dates on Monday, according to Max Mathurin, head of the council. It's unknown if this new date will affect the expected handover of power on February 7, 2006.

On Friday the electoral council decided push back the election dates for Haiti's first presidential election since the overthrow of President Aristide in 2004. New dates have been set for January 8, 2006 for the first round of the presidential and legislative elections, following by a second (runoff) round on February 15. Municipal elections have been delayed to March 6, 2006.

According to the council they need more time to organize the election process. They say they would not be able to set up polling stations by the December 27 date set by Prime Minister Latortue a few days ago. They need time to organize poll workers who do not have experience. One council member said that "for practical reasons, it was inevitable that we would miss the deadline," but that they would not miss the January 8 deadline currently set. They need time to print ballots, train poll workers, and distribute voter identification cards, an effort to fight potential voter fraud.

The Haitian constitution mandates a handover of power from one government to the next on February 7, but that will not be possible as elections will still be in progress. This is the 4th time the dates have been rescheduled.

&lt;a href="w%3ACarlos%20Ortega"&gt;Carlos Ortega&lt;/a&gt;, one of the top opposition leaders in &lt;a href="w%3AVenezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;, has been sentenced to 15 years in jail for inciting civil unrest during a strike.

Following a military &lt;a href="w%3Acoup%20d%27etat"&gt;coup d'etat&lt;/a&gt; in 2002, the two-month strike battered the country's oil industry in a effort to oust the elected president &lt;a href="w%3AHugo%20Chavez"&gt;Hugo Chavez&lt;/a&gt;. 

"From prison, I'll keep working, I'll keep fighting to preserve the freedom, democracy and unity of the people," said Mr Ortega in a telephone interview. "I'm no conspirator or coup plotter and I didn't betray my country."

While Ortega had initially fled Venezuela following the
issuing of an arrest warrant in 2003, the BBC reports that
he had returned to Venuzuela from Costa Rica last August.
Mr Ortega was arrested in March 2005.

Supporters of Mr Ortega have claimed the verdict is 
'politically motivated' according to BBC reports, with an
appeal being planned. 

Mr Ortega's opposition to 
current Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez is well known. &lt;a href="w%3AHugo%20Ch%C3%A1vez"&gt;Chavez&lt;/a&gt;
himself attempted (and failed) to carry out a military coup in 1992. Since then, Chavez was democratically elected president in 1998, 2000, and survived a recall referendum against him in 2004, and the constitutional reform referendum which he supported was supported by over 70% of the population in 1999.

According to a press release by &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales%20Police"&gt;New South Wales Police&lt;/a&gt;, police and fire brigade personnel arrived at the church at approximately 1:35 a.m. local time to discover the church well alight.

Around 30 firefighters fought the blaze for two hours before bringing it under control.

The church is located near an &lt;a href="w%3AIslam"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;ic centre and police are not sure if the fire is linked to the racial violence in Sydney over the past two days. Police are treating the fire as suspicious and will be continuing their investigations today.

After two days, the &lt;a href="w%3A2005%20Hertfordshire%20Oil%20Storage%20Terminal%20fire"&gt;2005 Hertfordshire Oil Storage Terminal fire&lt;/a&gt; has finally been extinguished. 

The fires began after a series of explosions early on the morning of 11 December 2005. The terminal, known locally as the &lt;a href="w%3ABuncefield%20Depot"&gt;Buncefield Depot&lt;/a&gt;, is an oil storage facility located near &lt;a href="w%3AHemel%20Hempstead"&gt;Hemel Hempstead&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AHertfordshire"&gt;Hertfordshire&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. These were some of the largest explosions ever to occur in the country and the incident has been described as the biggest of its kind in peacetime Europe. 

The Hertfordshire Fire Service chief Roy Wilsher said: "There are still some small bund (concrete container) fires, but the tanks are out." 

Fire crews would remain at the scene over the next few days cooling the area to ensure fires did not break out again, he said. 

A few residents are being allowed to return to their homes within an exclusion zone set up around the site.

<h2>A World Bank lead economist speaks on Bird Flu</h2>

In an online discussion Milan Brahmbhatt, World Bank lead economist for East Asia and the Pacific, answered a few questions about Bird Flu. Brahmbhatt said that the first thing to note is that "economic impacts can only be based on very broad assumptions." Brahmbhatt said that estimations of economic impacts are based on the SARS epidemic of 2003. 

Brahmbhatt said "the most immediate economic impact might arise actually not from actual death or sickness, but from the efforts of people to actually avoid becoming infected, and this was at least the experience during SARS, when people tried to avoid infection by minimizing face-to-face interactions with other people, and this resulted in a very severe demand shock for services sectors."

Brahmbhatt indicated that since a pandemic flu would be a global disease that wouldn't end as quickly as SARS did that the severe demand shock for services would occur globally and last longer. "this could entail a loss of world GDP of four to five percent of world GDP, which, according to Oxford, would amount to the sort of staggering of figure of $1,500 to $2,000 billion." Brahmbhatt continued. Brahmbhatt said "One study for the US calculated that a mild epidemic similar to that which occurred in 1968 might lead to US losses with a present value of perhaps $100-200 billion in today’s dollars." Brahmbhatt said that the World Bank will continue to calculate the economic impact as more information about the disease becomes available.

<h2>Gold prices drop</h2>

Japanese gold buyers took in profits causing gold prices to drop. Gold has risen 8% since the start of December. Gold rose to $540.90 a troy ounce on Monday, the highest level since January 1981. Gold has now dropped over $20 in late London trading. If gold stays above $500 for the remainder of the trading day it will mark the 10th successive day of trading above the mark. Gold has not traded above $500 for 10 days in a row since 1983.

Other precious metals were affected by gold's drop. Silver has dropped 8% from an 18 year high of $9.23 a troy ounce. Platinum has fallen $24 from a 26 year high of $1,015 an ounce. Palladium is down 9% to $269 an ounce.

Advisors are walking both sides of the Gold fence. "It has been a substantial rise in prices and the recent moves seem to be a case of profit taking before the end of the year," said, chief economist at Commonwealth Securities Craig James, "But the fundamental situation is still solid. We believe the price of gold is well supported at $475 an ounce."

Tobin Gorey of Commonwealth Bank of Australia said "Gold has had a good run and the Fed lifting rates by an expected quarter-percentage point wasn't going to reverse the selling trend we've seen in recent days." 

"We're seeing a lot of book-squaring and portfolio readjustment away from gold as the end of the year approaches," Gorey continued.

Lavalas candidate, &lt;a href="w%3AGerard%20Jean-Juste"&gt;Gerard Jean-Juste&lt;/a&gt; has been denied an application to be a candidate for president in the upcoming elections. The party had attempted to register the candidancy for him, but electoral council official Jaccillon Barthélemy says that applications have to be made in person. The party members brought a letter given to them by Jean-Juste showing his intentions to run. The priest has been jailed since July, because accused of having involvement in the murder of journalist &lt;a href="w%3AJacques%20Roche"&gt;Jacques Roche&lt;/a&gt;. Jean-Juste was in Miami at the time of the murder and has denied any involvement. He has yet to be charged in relation to the crime.

Louis Gérard Gilles, a former Lavalas senator and party representative, says that they plan to take the decision to court saying, "The council has no authority to prevent a candidate from registering," and "nothing in the constitution requires he should be present in person." Hundreds of Lavalas supporters marched the electoral council on Tuesday, but were stopped by UN peacekeepers.

The decision is seen as a potential catalyst for the Lavalas family to boycott the upcoming elections. The party is currently split among moderates and hard-line supporters (those closer to Aristide). This decision could swing power towards the hard-liners. If Lavalas was to boycott the elections it could mean a major knock to the next government's legitimacy, as Lavalas is the country's largest party.

An opinion poll conducted by CID group and &lt;a href="w%3AGallup"&gt;Gallup&lt;/a&gt; in early November shows that former president &lt;a href="w%3ARen%C3%A9%20Pr%C3%A9val"&gt;René Préval&lt;/a&gt; is the frontrunner for the upcoming January elections. These will be the first elections held in Haiti since the overthrow of President &lt;a href="w%3AAristide"&gt;Aristide&lt;/a&gt; in 2004. Préval is a former member of the Lavalas family party, the party of Aristide. Préval is running as an independent in this election and Lavalas is expected to run former prime minister, and currently imprisoned, Jean-Juste.

The poll surveyed the opinions of 1,200 people, and 32 percent said they favored Préval. Coming in second was the Haitian-American industrialist &lt;a href="w%3ADumarsais%20Sim%C3%A9us"&gt;Dumarsais Siméus&lt;/a&gt; with 21 percent. Former president &lt;a href="w%3ALeslie%20Manigat"&gt;Leslie François Manigat&lt;/a&gt; came in a distant third with 5 percent. Others receiving a vote include Evans Paul, a former mayor of Port-au-Prince with 4 percent, &lt;a href="w%3AGuy%20Philippe"&gt;Guy Philippe&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href="w%3A2004%20Haiti%20rebellion"&gt;2004 rebellion&lt;/a&gt; to overthrow Aristide with 4 percent, &lt;a href="w%3ASerge%20Gilles"&gt;Serge Gilles&lt;/a&gt;, a former senator with 4 percent, &lt;a href="w%3AMarc%20Bazin"&gt;Marc Bazin&lt;/a&gt; with 4 percent, &lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Henri%20Baker"&gt;Charles Henri Baker&lt;/a&gt; with 2 percent, and &lt;a href="w%3ADany%20Toussaint"&gt;Dany Toussaint&lt;/a&gt; with 2 percent.

♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20London%20Times"&gt;The London Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ has reported that, according to military sources, Israeli Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AAriel%20Sharon"&gt;Ariel Sharon&lt;/a&gt; has ordered Israel's armed forces to be prepared by the end of March for an attack on alleged secret uranium enrichment sites in Iran.

Israel has officially denied that it plans to attack Iran. However, Sharon warned, "Israel—and not only Israel—cannot accept a nuclear Iran. We have the ability to deal with this and we’re making all the necessary preparations to be ready for such a situation."

Israel is now at "G" readiness, which is the highest stage.

Israel's general election is on March 28, which coincides with the March deadline set by Sharon. Former Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ABenjamin%20Netanyahu"&gt;Benjamin Netanyahu&lt;/a&gt;, who is currently the frontrunner to lead the &lt;a href="w%3ALikud"&gt;Likud&lt;/a&gt; party, claimed that if Sharon does not attack "then when I form the new Israeli government, we’ll do what we did in the past against Saddam’s reactor, which gave us 20 years of tranquillity".

The uranium enrichment sites are said to be concealed in civilian locations.

<h2>Risks Digest points out "quite a coincidence"</h2>

You have probably heard about the recent Mizuho Securities stock-trading snafu. Mizuho mistakenly tried to sell 610,000 shares of J-Com Co., a company traded on the Tokyo stock market, for just 1 yen each. In fact, it was trying to sell 1 share for 610,000 yen.

Various newspapers, as well as Jeremy Epstein writing in Monday's Risks Digest, pointed out there was a similar snafu on the Tokyo stock market four years ago. Epstein quoted an earlier Digest from 2001 which described the story of a UBS Warburg trader, instead of entering an order to sell 16 Dentsu shares at 610,000 yen each, accidentally put in an order to sell 610,000 Dentsu shares for 16 yen each.

Epstein commented:

"That was also on the day of a "public debut" (aka IPO). However, it was a bargain - [the earlier snafu] cost UBS Warburg about $100M vs. about $235M [this year] for Mizuho Securities.

"I assume it's just coincidence that these two failures were both on the
Tokyo Stock market."

Peter G. Neumann, the Risks Digest moderator, added in a footnote:

"I knew the new case sounded familiar! Perhaps the 610,000 is a default number for an erroneous field? That's quite a coincidence."

Neumann noticed quite a coincidence indeed. But could the recurrence of the number 610,000 in both stories possibly be more than a coincidence?

The &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Australian Labor Party&lt;/a&gt; has appointed SLW Group to run it's advertisement campaign for the 2007 Australian Legislative Election.

STW Group was successul in gaining the $10 million account it was revealed today. The team dubbed "07" will be lead by senior executives, Luke Dunkerley and Neil Lawrence.

ALP campaign director Tim Gartell said that Lawrence had a wealth of experience with political campaigns, being part of the adveritsement team responsible for the election of a Victorian Labor government in the 1980s. He also added that Lawrence had worked on the campaign for election of &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Republican%20Movement"&gt;Australian Republican Movement&lt;/a&gt; representatives to the &lt;a href="w%3AConstitutional%20Convention%20%28Australia%29"&gt;Australian Constitutional Convention&lt;/a&gt; in 1998.

Present polling data from &lt;a href="http%3A//www.newspoll.com.au"&gt;Newspoll&lt;/a&gt; suggests that the ALP is beginning to regain support in the electorate, narrowly polling a higher percentage of primary support since late October, 2005, ending almost 10 months of being behind &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard's&lt;/a&gt; coalition government in polling.

The non-profit &lt;a href="w%3ACommittee%20to%20Protect%20Journalists"&gt;Committee to Protect Journalists&lt;/a&gt; has published its 2005 list of countries that have jailed journalists. Top of the list is &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, claimed to be holding 32 of the 125 editors, writers, and photo-journalists detained during the year. This is the seventh consecutive year that China has been top of the CPJ list.

Following not so far behind China is &lt;a href="w%3ACuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;, accused of detaining 24 journalists. In third and fourth place are the &lt;a href="w%3AAfrica"&gt;African&lt;/a&gt; nations of &lt;a href="w%3AEritrea"&gt;Eritrea&lt;/a&gt; (15 journalists detained) and &lt;a href="w%3AEthiopia"&gt;Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt; (13 journalists detained).

Analysis of the detailed breakdown in the CPJ report reveals that they rank the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; alongside the &lt;a href="w%3AJunta"&gt;Junta&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AMyanmar"&gt;Myanmar&lt;/a&gt; (Formerly known as Burma) in sixth place on the list with five detained journalists each. According to CPJ, they have excluded journalists only briefly detained such as &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Times"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; reporter &lt;a href="w%3AJudith%20Miller%20%28journalist%29"&gt;Judith Miller&lt;/a&gt;, instead focusing on those who are detained longer term.

The majority of charges and accusations that have been levelled against journalists are related to "anti-state" activities such as revealing state secrets, and acting against the interests of the state. The report does not include journalists who have not officially been confirmed as detained by a state.

, &lt;a href="w%3A%C3%85land"&gt;Åland&lt;/a&gt;'s gambling monopoly, has been challenged again by &lt;a href="w%3AFinland"&gt;Finnish&lt;/a&gt; authorities because of an attempt to offer internet gambling to the Finnish mainland. In &lt;a href="w%3AMainland%20Finland"&gt;Mainland Finland&lt;/a&gt;, the state-owned gambling institution ♡❤RAY♡❤ ("Raha-automaattiyhdistys" in &lt;a href="w%3AFinnish%20language"&gt;Finnish&lt;/a&gt;) holds a legal monopoly of gambling. ♡❤RAY♡❤ gives all profits to charity.

At the beginning of this year, ♡❤PAF♡❤ was sentenced for violation of gambling law. On December 14, the Interior ministry of Finland put ♡❤PAF♡❤ under police investigation again. Finland's interior minister Kari Rajamäki said that ♡❤PAF♡❤ has continued its gambling in Finland and ignored its last sentence.

♡❤PAF♡❤ has filed a lawsuit at Åland's local court with the state of Finland and the Finnish interior ministry entered as defendants. According to ♡❤PAF♡❤♡s CEO Lars Porko, the association wants to clear up once and for all who is in fact right in the dispute.

Åland is an autonomous part of Finland and as such subject to certain privileges, one of which is the existence of ♡❤PAF♡❤ in the first place.

On Wednesday, two days after provisional prime minister Boniface Alexandre announced that &lt;a href="Haitian%20provisional%20government%20dismisses%20Supreme%20Court%20justices"&gt;five supreme court justices had been dismissed&lt;/a&gt;, presidential candidate Dumarsais Siméus responded critically to the decision. Siméus said that it is, "...a sad and scary day for Haiti, for the rights of our 9 million citizens and for the future of freedom, democracy and separation of powers in Haiti." Some have attributed the firing of the justices to the decision by the court to allow Siméus to be on the ballot for president. The decision has been reached twice, &lt;a href="Haitian%20Supreme%20Court%20rules%20Simeus%20eligible"&gt;most recently on December 8&lt;/a&gt;.

Siméus characterized the firings as a violation of the separation of powers, claiming that they are motivated by a desire to obtain greater power in the government. According to Siméus, "judges of the Supreme Court and the Courts of Appeal are appointed life. Their term begins at the time they take their oath of office. The Supreme Court justices are appointed by the President from a list submitted by the Senate of three persons per court seat.

They may be removed from office only because of a legally determined abuse of authority or be suspended following an indictment leveled against them. They may not be reassigned, without their consent, even in the case of a promotion. Their service may be terminated during their term of office only in the event of a duly determined permanent physical or mental incapacity."

An investigation performed by the scientific review, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANature%20%28journal%29"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, on &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABritannica"&gt;Britannica&lt;/a&gt; science entries, found that the two encyclopedias have similar degrees of accuracy in their content. 

♡❤Nature♡❤ used &lt;a href="w%3Apeer%20review"&gt;peer reviewing&lt;/a&gt; to compare Wikipedia and Britannica's coverage of &lt;a href="w%3Ascience"&gt;science&lt;/a&gt;. In this study, entries were chosen from the websites of Wikipedia and Encyclopaedia Britannica on a broad range of scientific disciplines and sent to a relevant expert for peer review. Each reviewer examined the entry on a single subject from the two encyclopedias without being told which article came from which encyclopaedia. The reviewers were asked to check for errors, but were not told where the information came from.

Among 42 entries tested, the difference in accuracy was not significant: the average science entry in Wikipedia contained around four inaccuracies; Britannica, about three. In the pairs of articles reviewed, eight serious errors such as misinterpretations of important concepts were detected, four from each encyclopaedia. Reviewers also found many factual errors, omissions or misleading statements: 162 in Wikipedia and 123 in Britannica. Additionally, it was found that Wikipedia articles are 2.6 times as long as Britannica articles, meaning that there is a lower error/ommision per word ratio in Wikipedia.

The main criticism about Wikipedia was on its readability, with several reviewers commenting that the articles they read were poorly structured and confusing. 

As well as comparing the two encyclopedias, ♡❤Nature♡❤ surveyed more than 1,000 Nature authors and found that although more than 70% had heard of Wikipedia and 17% of those consulted it on a weekly basis, less than 10% help to update it. 

Wikipedia founder &lt;a href="w%3AJimmy%20Wales"&gt;Jimmy Wales&lt;/a&gt; welcomed the study. "We're hoping it will focus people's attention on the overall level of our work, which is pretty good," he told &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20News"&gt;BBC News&lt;/a&gt;.

Protests against the president of the Dominican Republic turned violent on Monday in Haiti, where tires were burned and thrown at the presidential palace in the capitol city of Port-au-Prince. Leonel Fernandez, leader of the neighboring Dominican Republic, was staying as a guest at the palace. 

The police reacted violently, resulting in 3 people being shot and wounded. Protestors had tried to block the motorcade of the Dominican president, which resulted in Haitian police firing shots into the air. UN representative David Wimhurst said UN peacekeepers were at the protests, but only Haitian police and bodyguards of the Dominican president fired shots. President Fernandez cut short his visit and most of the diplomatic staff withdrew from the country. The Dominican ambassador in Haiti demanded an apology for the incident.

The protests were over alleged abuses of Haitian refugees in the Dominican Republic, an issue of importance to the relationship of the two countries in the past several months. In May the Dominican government deported at least 2,000 Haitian in response to murder of a Dominican woman. Earlier in December several Dominican villagers burned down settlements of Haitians in response for the death of a business man.

Responding to the tensions that have arisen between citizens of the Dominican Republic and immigrants, President Fernandez said prior to his Haiti visit, "… we must understand that the countries that share borders, mainly if they have unequal economic and social levels of development, historically usually have relations of conflicts." 

Provisional President Boniface Alexandre said that he hopes these talks could fuel better relations between the neighboring countries. Dominican President Fernandez says that he deplores any act of violence against Haitians in his country.

<h2>Amgen buys Abgenix, retains full rights to profits</h2>

Biotech company Amgen announced today that it will purchase Abgenix for $2.2 billion. Amgen and Abgenix co-developed a late-stage cancer drug panitumumab. The drug shows promise as a low-side effect alternative to Erbitux (marketed by ImClone Systems and Bristol-Myers Squibb). 

The takeover means that Amgen will no longer have to split profits from the drug 50/50 with Abgenix. Amgen paid $22.50/share, 53.6% greater than today's closing price, but analysts state that the stock has enough potential to justify the high expenditure.

Earlier today at 6pm EST, &lt;a href="w%3AMitt%20Romney"&gt;Mitt Romney&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AGovernor%20of%20Massachusetts"&gt;Governor of Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; announced he would not seek a second-term for the highest office in the &lt;a href="w%3ACommonwealth%20of%20Massachusetts"&gt;Commonwealth of Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;.

The announcement did not come as a surprise due to the fact Romney announced he would make an announcement on his political future last month. Romney has also been visiting key primary states for the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20presidential%20election%2C%202008"&gt;2008 presidential election&lt;/a&gt; and during the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20presidential%20election%2C%202004"&gt;2004 presidential election&lt;/a&gt;, Republicans told the press, "to keep an eye on Romney."

Romney was elected in 2003, replacing &lt;a href="w%3AJane%20Swift"&gt;Jane Swift&lt;/a&gt; and his term ends in &lt;a href="w%3AJanuary%202007"&gt;Janurary 2007&lt;/a&gt;. If he does decide to run for the presidency, he will have ample time when the terms ends. So far, Romney has denied that he is running for President and may possibly change his mind and run for &lt;a href="w%3Are-election"&gt;re-election&lt;/a&gt;. He also said that he would endorse his &lt;a href="w%3ALieutenant%20Governor"&gt;Lieutenant Governor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AKerry%20Healey"&gt;Kerry Healey&lt;/a&gt; if she decides to run for governor.

Romney, born in Detroit, is the son of former &lt;a href="w%3AGovernor%20of%20Michigan"&gt;Governor of Michigan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Romney"&gt;George W. Romney&lt;/a&gt;. Becoming governor isn't Romney's first foray into politics; Romney ran against senior Massachusetts senator and Kennedy family member, &lt;a href="w%3ATed%20Kennedy"&gt;Ted Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;. Romney won 41% percent of the vote against Kennedy in the closest election in Kennedy's entire tenure in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;United States Senate&lt;/a&gt;. Romney was also CEO of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee which was in charge of planning the &lt;a href="w%3A2002%20Winter%20Olympics"&gt;2002 Winter Olympics&lt;/a&gt; from 1999 to 2002, he took charge after the &lt;a href="w%3A2002%20Winter%20Olympic%20bid%20scandal"&gt;2002 Winter Olympic bid scandal&lt;/a&gt;. He also sat on the board of Massachusetts-based office supply giant, &lt;a href="w%3AStaples%2C%20Inc"&gt;Staples, Inc&lt;/a&gt;.

Unlike the usenet postings in Australia being made by an unknown organisation "Action for Australia", the White Crusaders of the Racial Holy War are well known. According to their website, they are "crusaders", and believe in the CREATIVITY religion - created for the "Survival, Expansion, and Advancement of the White Race."

The posters say "If Sydney can do it so can we... let's take back our land".

Leaders of the New Zealand National Party and United Future Party have condemned the posters. Don Brash leader of the New Zealand National Party said that the White Crusaders of the Racial Holy War are "a small, fascist underbelly, hell-bent on causing division and destroying New Zealand's egalitarian ethos ... they are thugs and bigots"

A cid-gallup poll shows former head of state &lt;a href="w%3A%C3%93scar%20Arias"&gt;Óscar Arias Sánchez&lt;/a&gt; is currently atop in opinion polls as the likely next president with 45% in the poll. Arias declared his intention to run after the legislature decided to bring back presidential re-election in 2003. He will be running for the National Liberation Party. He has been outspoken in favor of the ratification of &lt;a href="w%3ACAFTA"&gt;CAFTA&lt;/a&gt; (the Central American Free Trade Agreement).

Others receiving votes include Ottón Solís with 20% (Citizens Action Party, PAC), Ricardo Toledo with 10% (Social-Christian Unity Party, PUSC), Otto Guevara with 8% (Libertarian Movement, ML), and Antonio Álvarez Desanti with 6% (Union for Change, UPC).

Six media organisations, including &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Fairfax%20Holdings"&gt;Fairfax&lt;/a&gt;, are mounting a constitutional challenge to secret hearings in an upcoming terrorism trial in Australia.

The trial involves Sydney man Faheem Khalid Lodhi, who is charged with committing acts in preparation for a terrorist attack. Lodhi is accused of conspiring with French terror suspect Willie Brigitte to attack Sydney's military bases and electricity supply network.

Federal &lt;a href="w%3AAttorney-general%23Australia"&gt;Attorney-General&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APhilip%20Ruddock"&gt;Phillip Ruddock&lt;/a&gt; will issue a certificate to prevent information judged to be sensitive from reaching the public at Lodhi's trial. The Federal Attorney-General has the powers to do this under the National Security Information (Criminal and Civil Proceedings) Act.

The grounds for the challenge are that National Security Information legislation violates the &lt;a href="w%3ASeparation%20of%20powers%20in%20Australia"&gt;separation of executive and judical powers&lt;/a&gt;, required by the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20constitution"&gt;Australian constitution&lt;/a&gt;. Tom Blackburn, SC, counsel for the media groups mounting the challenge claims that the act allows for the federal executive to intrude into judicial matters by ordering parts of the trial are kept secret.

The challenge will be heard on 31st January 2006 by Justice Anthony Whealy of the &lt;a href="w%3ASupreme%20Court%20of%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Supreme Court of NSW&lt;/a&gt;.

In the course of Lodhi's trial, towards the end of December Justice Anthony Whealy ruled that evidence and pre-trial maters are to remain secret. This ruling is separate to the constitutional challenge.

Jane Kim, the program manager for &lt;a href="w%3ARSS"&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20Explorer"&gt;Internet Explorer&lt;/a&gt; 7, announced recently that her team had chosen a graphical representation of &lt;a href="w%3AWeb%20syndication"&gt;Web syndication&lt;/a&gt; feeds &amp;mdash; one popularized by its competitor. Microsoft employees have been posting variations of conceptual designs since earlier this year, but have now announced that they chose an icon used by the rival browser, &lt;a href="w%3AMozilla%20Firefox"&gt;Mozilla Firefox&lt;/a&gt;. The Microsoft team collaborated with Mozilla &lt;a href="w%3AEmployee"&gt;staff&lt;/a&gt; during the selection process.

"I'm excited to announce that we're adopting the icon used in Firefox," wrote Kim. "We'll be using the icon in the IE7 command bar whenever a page has a feed associated with it, and we'll also use it in other places in the browser whenever we need a visual to represent RSS and feeds." 

Microsoft is poised to release IE7 with many of the new features popularized in &lt;a href="w%3AFirefox"&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt;, such as browser tabs, feed support, full PNG and CSS support, and other improvements.

On December 14th, after a single reading, the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Parliament"&gt;EU Parliament&lt;/a&gt; passed the &lt;a href="w%3ATelecommunications%20data%20retention"&gt;Data Retention&lt;/a&gt; directive. 378 parliamentarians voted in favour of the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union%20Directive"&gt;Directive&lt;/a&gt;, 30 abstained and 197 voted against.

The so-called "Big Brother" directive, highly controversial at least among those even aware of its existence, requires all internet and telecommunications service providers to log all traffic metadata (who called who, who visited what sites) in Europe for 6 to 24 months and turn the data over to police forces, secret services, and other organisations, as decided on by national governments. The law was drafted and passed in three months, an extraordinarily rapid process, and was heavily influenced by earlier UK legislation that failed to pass in Britain.

<h2>Unclarities</h2>
Significant aspects of this law are the lack of special measures for security and privacy of the collected data, lack of any rule as to how costs are to be reimbursed. Such measures had been proposed as amendments, but the block vote in Parliament (following a deal between the leaders of the two largest parties, the Christian democrat-conservative &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20People%27s%20Party"&gt;European People's Party&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AParty%20of%20European%20Socialists"&gt;Party of European Socialists&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Commission"&gt;European Commission&lt;/a&gt;) rejected these amendments.

All mention of "terrorism" was removed from the original text, so the approved law specifies these measures for "serious crime" only. The definition of "serious crime" is not specified.

Partially, the law harmonises existing practice, allowing police forces to rely on retention of data for their investigations. In certain countries, privacy laws that mandated the destruction of such data after six months have hindered investigations. Poland, following one such case, wanted a 15 year data retention period.

However, other influences have made the law much broader than this. Specifically, the requirement to log all subscriber information for Internet communications has raised serious concerns amongst &lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20service%20provider"&gt;ISPs&lt;/a&gt;, and technical analysts. The reason: the term "communication" is defined vaguely, as "all emails and Internet telephony". There exists no technical means of logging subscriber information for such communications, short of recording every &lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20protocol%20suite"&gt;TCP and UDP&lt;/a&gt; packet that is carried across a network connection. This would create such huge volumes of data that small to medium ISPs would be unable to operate, and large ISPs would have to increase their prices considerably. All provisions in the law for reimbursement were removed - this is up to each country to decide.

Thus the Data Retention directive, while cracking down on anonymous public communications tools such as open wifi, cybercafes, pre-paid phone cards (and possibly even public phone booths), has ignored the use of web-based email, self-hosted mail servers, chat systems, &lt;a href="w%3AVirtual%20private%20network"&gt;VPNs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AVoice%20over%20IP"&gt;VoIP technologies&lt;/a&gt;, and so on. The premise that criminals will restrict themselves to the few simple protocols that can be monitored to extract "subscriber information" is weak at best.

The technical inadequacy of this law is extreme, and is probably due to its rushed progress through the legislative system. The main driver for this rushed process appears to be a number of national governments that are keen to increase surveillance of their own citizens, and wish EU "backing" for such acts. Note that the Commission and Council do not represent an elected body but are composed of the national governments and professional civil service, and there is considerable tension between these bodies and the elected Parliament. It is plausible that the Data Retention directive was just the first of several laws that will pass through this new "fast track" process.

<h2>Comments</h2>
The &lt;a href="w%3AFoundation%20for%20a%20Free%20Information%20Infrastructure"&gt;Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure&lt;/a&gt;, a lobbying association, expects, early in 2006, to see a new attempt to "harmonise patent legislation", the so-called "Community Patent Directive", which will introduce &lt;a href="w%3Asoftware%20patent"&gt;software patents&lt;/a&gt; by the back door. Note that a previous attempt by the Commission and Council to impose software patents (the "Computer Implemented Inventions directive") was rejected by Parliament in June 2005.

Other commentators have noted that the EU produces vast numbers of directives, about ten per month, and most of these get passed into national law only very slowly. &lt;a href="w%3AIreland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; have stated that they will take this directive to the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Court%20of%20Justice"&gt;European Court of Justice&lt;/a&gt;. However, that will not prevent other countries from implementing it in a more or less severe form.

&lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; has, in the last few months, been closing &lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20cafe"&gt;cybercafes&lt;/a&gt; that do not keep strict records of the identity of every user. It is such indicators that have convinced many privacy advocates that this law is not about &lt;a href="w%3Aterrorism"&gt;terrorism&lt;/a&gt; at all, but about monitoring and controlling &lt;a href="w%3Acivil%20society"&gt;civil society&lt;/a&gt;.

The English version of &lt;a href="w%3AMain%20Page"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; has reached 865,835 articles, 220 million words, 389,591 illustrations and pictures since January, 2001.&lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk%3ALargest_encyclopedia"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. 

Compared to the Spanish language &lt;a href="w%3AEnciclopedia%20universal%20ilustrada%20europeo-americana"&gt;Encyclopedia ESPASA&lt;/a&gt;, which has 117 volumes, 175,000 pages, 200 million words, 197,000 black and white illustrations, 4,500 color illustrations, 5 million bibliographic references and 100,000 biographies &lt;a href="http%3A//es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enciclopedia_Espasa"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the English Wikipedia is now larger, in terms of number of articles and number of words, than the largest encyclopedia of the &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ASpanish%20language"&gt;Spanish language&lt;/a&gt;. Note that this is just a quantitative comparison. No judgement is made about the quality of the above-mentioned encyclopedias.

The project to write ESPASA was founded in 1860 by &lt;a href="w%3Aes%3AJos%C3%A9%20Espasa%20Anguera"&gt;José Espasa Anguera&lt;/a&gt; and continued in 1926 by &lt;a href="w%3Aes%3AEditorial%20Espasa-Calpe"&gt;Editorial Espasa-Calpe&lt;/a&gt;, which today belongs to &lt;a href="w%3Aes%3AGrupo%20Planeta"&gt;Grupo Planeta&lt;/a&gt;. The main works were published in 1905 and consisted of 72 volumes. In 1931 a 10 volumes appendix was published which includes an update of the previous volumes. 

The reference work has been periodically updated by the biannual ♡❤Suplementos♡❤ since 1935. The latest ♡❤Suplemento♡❤ was published in 2005. In 1997 the work included a &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AWorld%20Atlas"&gt;World Atlas&lt;/a&gt;. It has taken ESPASA 145 years to get to the point where it is today. In less than 5 years Wikipedia has reached a similar point.

An average of 1500 new articles are created on Wikipedia every day with around 23.4 edits per article.

An angry mob attacked priest, and close political ally of former president Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Gerard Jean-Juste at the funeral of a journalist Jacques Roche who was found shot dead last week. The body was found handcuffed in a slum district of Port-au-Prince. Journalist Jacques Roche had been the victim of an abduction, which have been an ongoing problem in &lt;a href="Haiti"&gt;Haiti&lt;/a&gt; for most of this year. At the mass Bishop Andre Dumas said "the death of this journalist must awaken our national consciousness against violence, and all the evils our society is going through."

Jean-Juste was arrested at the funeral and taken in for questioning. According to Michael Lucius, head of the judicial police, Jean-Juste has been detained awaiting instruction by prosecutors on what, if any, criminal charges he will face. The charges could be related to the murder of the journalist, or on possession of illegal weapons, obtained while Aristide was still president. Speaking to the associated press from the police station, Jean-Juste said "I'm a priest, I get beaten in a church, and now it's me they want to arrest."

Officials of the Fanmi Lavalas party in Haiti threatened boycott of the upcoming general elections if one of their party leaders, Father Gerard Jean-Juste, is not released from jail. Jean-Juste is being jailed, arrested a month ago on July 21, in relation to the murder of journalist. The Fanmi Lavalas party is currently divided among moderate factions and those with closer ties to former President Aristide.

Jean-Juste is believed to be a favorite presidential candidate for the party. A representative of the party, Gerald Gilles, commented saying, "after several consultations, the masses that we represent and the base of the party claim Father Jean-Juste as their presidential candidate. So he will be our candidate," and "we say loud and clear (that) we'll boycott the elections if Jean-Juste, and many other political prisoners that are potential candidates for our party, are not released."

Chilean and Peruvian government websites have both experienced attacks by unknown suspects, according to BBC News.

The attacks are reported as being in connection with a dispute over fishing rights in the Pacific Ocean, and may have to also do with Alberto Fujimori's detention in Chile awaiting extradition to Peru.

The most recent messages (on the Peruvian Judiciary's web page) are believed to be the work of a Chilean hacker. According to Peru the attacks may be in response to an earlier incident in which the Chilean National Emergency Office's page was struck. (BBC News)

One of the leaders of last year's overthrow of President Aristide in Haiti, Guy Philippe, now says that he will participate in the upcoming elections as a presidential candidate. The leader will run for the party of his guerilla army, the Front for National Reconstruction (FRN). He says that the elections are important for creating a legitimate democratic government in the state of Haiti, and that he believes he is the best leader to move the country forward. Philippe made the announcement via a Port-au-Prince radio station, the dominate form of media in the nation.

Giving an interview, Philippe spoke on several issues believed to be important to the upcoming elections. Philippe criticized the interim government of President Boniface Alexandre and Prime Minister Gerard Latortue, which he sees as illegitimate because it does not answer to anyone. He also criticized the electoral council, which is appointed by the government, as being a puppet department. The council, he says, has been too slow in setting up operating registration offices and that the mobile registration offices have not been arriving to districts with low registration. He also recommended that voters do not sell their consciousness. Philippe refers to the habit of political parties to send people to exchange money for a promise to vote for their candidate on election day.

The Westlink M7 motorway is set to open today some eight months ahead of schedule.

The 40 km long motorway runs from the Hills Motorway (M2) at Baulkham Hills and ends at the South Western Motorway (M5) at Prestons. The motorway features 17 interchanges for access to and from Western Sydney suburbs.

The most complicated interchange along the motorway is the Lighthorse Interchange at Eastern Creek. This interchange links the Westlink M7 with the Western Motorway (M4). It is the largest interchange in the Southern Hemisphere.

The motorway will be officially opened by Prime Minister John Howard and will be opened in stages. Motorists will be able to tell if an interchange is open as it will be indicated by signs.

Westlink M7 claim that the road will take more than 200 people and 12 hours to open and is the longest section of motorway to ever be opened in one day in Sydney.

The Westlink M7 motorway has been funded by the Commonwealth Government and private enterprise and is owned by Westlink M7. It is Australia's first toll road to use distance based tolling, with tolls ranging from 40c to $5.97 depending on distance travelled. Tolling is fully electronic with motorists requiring an electronic tag or pass. There are no tollbooths as cash is not accepted.

The Westlink M7 motorway will be free to travel on until January 15, 2006.

<h2>Layoffs continue but many employers say there is a worker shortage</h2>

&lt;a href="w%3AGeneral%20Motors"&gt;General Motors&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AFord"&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt; are laying off workers by the thousands and analysts predict a decline in housing production yet according to a CNN Money article labor experts and executives say there is already a shortage of workers. Retiring &lt;a href="w%3Ababy%20boomer"&gt;baby boomers&lt;/a&gt; plus a growing economy expected in 2006 may move the labor market in favor of job seekers. 

"I would say by the end of next year, it could take 12, 13, maybe 14 weeks to fill a spot, and that's when you'll see upward pressure on wages," said Jeff Joerres, chairman and CEO of &lt;a href="w%3AManpower"&gt;Manpower&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3ADeloitte%20Consulting"&gt;Deloitte Consulting&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Association%20of%20Manufacturers"&gt;National Association of Manufacturers&lt;/a&gt; have conducted a survey finding that more than 80% of surveyed manufacturers say they are experiencing a shortage of qualified workers. 90% say they have a moderate to severe shrortage of qualified skilled workers. 83% say these shortages are affecting their production.

"They've been getting lean and pushing the efficiency envelope for a decade," Dick Kleinert, a principal with Deloitte who conducted the NAM survey, said "So in this latest survey, when we asked what was the most important factor in their success, being a low cost producer status ranked only No. 3 on the list. What ranked as No. 1 attribute was having a high performance work force."

<h2>GM offers $15 billion in tech contracts</h2>

Despite being in financial trouble &lt;a href="w%3AGeneral%20Motors"&gt;General Motors&lt;/a&gt; is holding $15 billion in tech contracts.
The five year contracts, planned to be awarded within weeks. The 40 contracts will be the largest group of contracts ever awarded at the same time.

&lt;a href="w%3AElectronic%20Data%20Systems"&gt;EDS&lt;/a&gt;, spun off by GM in 1996, carried out $2 billion in business with GM last year 10% of EDS' revenue. EDS's contract will expire in June.

GM plans to break up it's tech &lt;a href="w%3Aoutsourcing"&gt;outsourcing&lt;/a&gt; budget into smaller pieces and standardize
its outsourcing operation so that it can remove a partner without effecting the entire operation.
This will shake up the $300 billion tech outsourcing industry.

"This is revolutionary, If it works for both sides, in a couple of years you'll see a lot of other companies doing it." George F. Colony, president of &lt;a href="w%3AForrester%20Research"&gt;Forrester Research&lt;/a&gt; said.

Ralph J. Szygenda, GM's &lt;a href="w%3AChief%20Technology%20Officer"&gt;CTO&lt;/a&gt;, said he decided that the whole outsourcing industry was broken when GMs Hermes web site, intended to sell cars in Brazil, kept crashing. The site was run by EDS, &lt;a href="w%3AIBM"&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt;, and a few others. When Szygenda held a meeting to find out why, "there was a lot of finger-pointing, and nobody would fess up to the problem," he said. "I realized this wasn't going to work. And I saw it wasn't just a GM problem. It was an industry problem."

So now Szygenda intends to implement his plan. Either GM's way, or the highway.

What about the little guys? Szygenda intends to place $2.5 billion to $3 billion aside on innovative technology. "We use hundreds of start-up companies," he says. "We're not closing out innovation."

Around 8.1 million inner-city residents could be affected by a transit system strike in New York City.

NYC mayor Michael Bloomberg said in a press conference that there would be "no winners" if a transit system strike became a reality. Contract talks have not begun with the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) and the Transit Workers Union Local 100.

Bloomberg also said that the city could lose $400 million a day from its economy during a strike, and City government could lose $22 million per day.

CNN reports that Bloomberg has planned to close several key streets in Manhattan to general traffic: Fifth and Madison avenues from 23rd to 96th streets; 26th, 29th, 49th and 50th streets from First to 12th avenues; and part of Church Street in the event of a complete transit system closure.

A strike, if it occures, would begin one minute after midnight EST when the Transit Workers' contract expires.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=US%20offers%20to%20eliminate%20duties%20on%20Cotton%2C%20Africa%20says%20it%27s%20not%20enough&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

"The United States is willing, under the duty-free, quota-free commitments we will make, to provide duty free access cotton for these West African countries" the US trade representative announced at the WTO talks in Hong Kong Thursday. The US is under heavy pressure to drop Cotton tariffs and subsidies.

Mali, Burkino Faso, Benin, Chad, and Senegal complain that the tariff free offer does not address the subsidies United States provides to domestic cotton growers. Some countries claim the subsidies against the WTO's anti-dumping policy.

"The real problem for African cotton producers is dumping on the world market, resulting from domestic and export subsidies. That is why we need to agree this week on additional disciplines on domestic support" EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson said.

"They don't take in any cotton. They export cotton. Their textile industries have all moved abroad. Why would they import any of our cotton? What they need to do is halt the subsidies. Without subsidies they can't produce" Francois Traore, president of the African Cotton Producers Association, said.

Portman argued cutting global tariffs are as least as important as cutting subsidies.

India has a 10% tariff on cotton imports, under current WTO rules it could raise the tariff to 100% at any time. China imposes a 1% tariff on the first 4 million bales, after which a tariff of 5% to 40% is applied. By comparison the US allows a small amount of cotton at low duties and then applies a 20% on the remainder.

A bill in the US Congress this week contains a cotton program known as Step 2, which pays exporters and millers to buy US cotton. The WTO has declared the program illegal.

"We know with certainty that it's the US subsidies that are causing problems for our farmers." Mamadou Salissou Habi Niger's minister of trade said.

African cotton producers have said that they will not endorse any deals that emerge from the Hong Kong talks if rich countries do not reduce cotton subsidies to their own farmers.

During &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20War%20II"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="Norway"&gt;Norwegians&lt;/a&gt; wore paperclips on their shirts to protest the Nazi slaughter of Jews and other ethnic groups.

Led by junior high language arts teacher Mrs. Aryel Saldate, the class has already collected over 7,000 paperclips. Mrs. Saldate had the idea when she saw a special on the television network HBO about another teacher who did the same thing and actually collected 6 million paperclips. Although it took the other class five years to achieve this feat, it helped her students realize just how widespread the Holocaust was.

Mrs. Saldate can be reached by e-mail at asaldate@sjcoe.net. The official website for the cause is listed below.

Supporters of jailed priest &lt;a href="w%3AJean-Juste"&gt;Jean-Juste&lt;/a&gt; say that he needs medical treatment in the United States. His attourney, Bill Quigley, told reporters that the priest, who was considered a potential presidential candidate before his arrest and long detainment, may have cancer and should be released so that he can seek medical attention in the United States. A doctor, Dr. John Carroll, who examined Jean-Juste said that an abnormal white blood cell count, as well as swelling in his neck and under his arms could be early signs of cancer. The government of interim President Alenxandre said that their doctors have examined the priest as well and said no signs of cancer exist.

Jean-Juste has been in jail since July when he was arrested at a funeral of a popular Haitian journalist and poet. He was originally detained for questioning related to the murder but also allegations of illegal weapons possessions have been brought up. He's yet to be charged in any crimes. The doctor who made the claim of possible cancer is a supporter of Jean-Juste and some might think that this is an exaggeration to allow Jean-Juste out of Haiti to plan his political future.

&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales%20Police%20Service"&gt;New South Wales Police&lt;/a&gt; Commissioner &lt;a href="w%3AKen%20Moroney"&gt;Ken Moroney&lt;/a&gt; has warned people to stay away from &lt;a href="w%3ACronulla"&gt;Cronulla&lt;/a&gt;, the Eastern suburbs beaches, Central Coast beaches, &lt;a href="w%3AWollongong"&gt;Wollongong&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANewcastle"&gt;Newcastle&lt;/a&gt; this weekend, as more violence is expected. Police will be using new powers to set up roadblocks, implement alcohol bans, and search vehicles. There will be 1,500 extra police patrolling on Saturday, and 2,000 on Sunday. 

"Our latest intelligence tells us that large numbers of people are planning to go to these areas on Sunday to cause riotous behaviour. In the interests of public safety it is my duty to warn the public that these areas have been identified as targets."

"Anyone who wants to travel to these identified areas is very likely to get caught up in long traffic delays and may well have their car searched by police if they want to enter these areas", Commissioner Moroney said. "Any unnecessary travel is almost certainly going to cause traffic gridlock and make it a much harder job for police."

There have been six days of violence in Sydney after riots in Cronulla on Sunday, sparked by an assault on a lifesaver the previous weekend. The police operation, dubbed Operation Seta, has been attempting to manage the problems. The number of police assigned to Operation Seta has gradually increased throughout the week, from a couple of hundred on Monday night, to the 2,000 expected this Sunday.

Moderate flooding has hit the province of &lt;a href="w%3ANakhon%20Sri%20Thammarat%20Province"&gt;Nakhon Sri Thammarat&lt;/a&gt; in southern &lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;. Moderate to heavy rain persists in the area, further exacerbating the flooding conditions. The northeast monsoon has intensified the flow of rainfall-laden air from the Gulf of Thailand. Torrential rains have been plaguing the nine southernmost provinces of the country for nearly two weeks and further downpours are forecast for later this week.

Thung Song District in Nakhon Sri Thammarat province is experiencing waist-high floodwaters in downtown shopping areas. Transportation has ground to a halt in affected areas. In &lt;a href="w%3ASongkhla%20Province"&gt;Songkhla Province&lt;/a&gt;, the government has called for steps to be taken to prevent further flooding of the commerial district of Hat Yai. Rail tracks have been lifted in some areas to permit flood waters to leave the city, and the Thai Navy has been ordered to take part in relief efforts.

In Muang District of Nakhon Sri Thammarat, many roads have been closed and sandbags are being deployed to help affected businesses. Schools throughout the province have been closed because of flooding conditions. Other provinces, including &lt;a href="w%3APhattalung%20Province"&gt;Phattalung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APattani%20Province"&gt;Pattani&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AYala%20Province"&gt;Yala&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANarathiwat%20Province"&gt;Narathiwat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATrang%20Province"&gt;Trang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASukhothai%20Province"&gt;Sukhothai&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASatun%20Province"&gt;Satun&lt;/a&gt; have experienced similar problems with high tides and heavy rain paralysing much of the region.

The Meteorological Department of the Thailand Ministry of Information and Communication Technology issued a weather advisory concerning the flooding, "People in the lower South and navigators in the Gulf of Thailand should exercise caution and small boats should stay from December 15 until December 18." It is reported that this has left some tourists stranded on smaller resort islands in the Gulf of Thailand.

Across the border in &lt;a href="w%3AMalaysia"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;, three are reported to have died and over 10,000 been evacuated as a result of the flooding.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=President%20Bush%20of%20the%20United%20States%20authorized%20NSA%20surveillance%20of%20citizens%2C%20bypassing%20court%20warrants&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

In 2002, as a part of ongoing anti-terrorist operations, &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; secretly authorized the &lt;a href="National%20Security%20Agency"&gt;National Security Agency&lt;/a&gt; (NSA) to spy on Americans and others in the United States making contact with persons in other nations. According to a ♡❤&lt;a href="The%20New%20York%20Times"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ report, the NSA monitored the international telephone calls and international e-mail messages of "hundreds, and perhaps thousands of people" inside the United States over the past three years without warrants. 

Specifically, the NSA performed wiretaps on international communications that included a U.S. participant. The authorization was kept secret until December 2005, when it was reported in ♡❤The New York Times♡❤, engendering serious controversy over both the legality of the blended international/domestic wiretaps and the revelation of this highly-classified program in a time of war.

According to ♡❤The New York Times♡❤, &lt;a href="John%20Yoo"&gt;John Yoo&lt;/a&gt;, the former deputy in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOffice%20of%20Legal%20Counsel"&gt;Office of Legal Counsel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , justified the domestic spying in a classified &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJustice%20Department"&gt;Justice Department&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; legal opinion, arguing that these activities were covered by congressional approval of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Awar%20on%20terrorism"&gt;war on terrorism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . That legal argument was similar to another 2002 memo authored primarily by Yoo, which outlined an extremely narrow definition of torture. That opinion, which was signed by another Justice official, was formally disavowed after it was disclosed by ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Washington%20Post"&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤.

President Bush insisted that he has not compromised &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acivil%20liberties"&gt;civil liberties&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . 
"Revealing classified information is illegal," he said during an unusual live, on-camera version of his weekly radio address, about this secret program that was revealed in media reports yesterday. 
Senior members of congress from both parties called for an explanation. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASenate%20Judiciary%20Committee"&gt;Senate Judiciary Committee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; chairman &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AArlen%20Specter"&gt;Arlen Specter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , stated that "there is no doubt that this is inappropriate". 
Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATrent%20Lott"&gt;Trent Lott&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; defended the NSA directive saying "I don't agree with the libertarians. I want my security first. I'll deal with all the details after that."

Traditionally the &lt;a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation"&gt;Federal Bureau of Investigation&lt;/a&gt; conducts most domestic eavesdropping after obtaining warrants for it. The domestic mandate of the NSA has been traditionally limited to the surveillance of foreign nationals and embassies. The NSA has reportedly obtained court orders to undertake missions in Washington, New York and other cities.

Several national security officials say the jurisdiction granted the NSA goes far beyond the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUSA%20PATRIOT%20Act"&gt;USA PATRIOT Act&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Under the act, it's necessary to seek a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AForeign%20Intelligence%20Surveillance%20Act"&gt;F.I.S.A.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) warrant every time law enforcement eavesdrops within the U.S. Some officials say they consider warrantless eavesdropping inside the United States to be unlawful and possibly unconstitutional.

One government official involved in the operation said he privately complained to a Congressional official about his doubts about the program's legality. But nothing happened. "People just looked the other way because they didn't want to know what was going on," he said. 

♡❤The New York Times♡❤, the newspaper that broke the news, stated that it delayed publication of this story for a year after the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said it could jeopardize investigations and alert would-be terrorists under surveillance.

The &lt;a href="US"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="US%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; failed to renew certain provisions of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUSA%20PATRIOT%20Act"&gt;PATRIOT Act&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; which are due to expire at the end of the year. A vote to end the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Afilibuster"&gt;filibuster&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; which has stalled the bill gained only 52 votes, failing to advance the bill. 

A majority of Democrats and some Republicans have resorted to a filibuster, citing concerns that the bill under consideration which permits government access to confidential personal data failed to safeguard privacy and protect innocent citizens from government scrutiny. Four Republicans joined the Democrats in voting against the bill, while 2 Democrats voted in favor of ending the filibuster.

"That decision is irresponsible and it endangers the lives of our citizens. The senators who are filibustering must stop their delaying tactics and the Senate must reauthorize the Patriot Act," said President George W. Bush of the senate vote.

The measure to extend some of the PATRIOT Act measures has already passed in the House of Representatives. The Act was originally passed in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, and gives the government secret access to private information such as library and medical records, as well as roving wiretaps which may apply to multiple phone numbers.

Spencer, 58, died at a &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; hospital, said publicist Ron Hofmann. Hofmann released no other immediate details. 

Spencer's work on the show earned him an Emmy Award for supporting actor in a drama series in 2002, as well as a Golden Globe nomination. Before appearing on the hit political drama, Spencer played the quirky and charismatic New York attorney Tommy Mullaney on "L.A. Law."

The leaders of the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; have struck a deal on the 2007-2013 budget. Negotiations were characterized by host country's Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; as "extraordinarily complicated".

The biggest issues were different views between &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;the UK&lt;/a&gt; and rest of the EU. UK wanted to keep it's high membership discount, negotiated before economic growth made it one of the richest members, while other members wanted it to participate with relatively equal net payment. France's primary issue was maintaining farming subsidies. Rest of the Europe was mostly interested in modernizing European economy by decreasing both UK's discounts and France's subsidies. &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; appeared as a pulling force between France and UK to secure the deal.

France continues to receive it's highly criticized subsidies. The UK gave up 10.5 billion euros in exchange for a review of farm subsidies in 2008-2009, but the net membership discount will actually increase. Small member states such as &lt;a href="w%3ASweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; increased their role as largest net payers in relative to output.

Key features in the reached deal:
<ul>
BULLET::::- Total budget will be 862.36 billion euros, equaling to 1.045% of the EU's total GDP
BULLET::::- Development aid will be 157 billion euros
BULLET::::- Farm budget will be 293 billion euros

</ul>
Most see the resulted budget as a poor comproromise, but necessarily for the state of union and financial planning in the new member states.

Talks between the &lt;a href="w%3AMetropolitan%20Transportation%20Authority%20%28New%20York%29"&gt;MTA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http%3A//www.twulocal100.org"&gt;Transit Workers Union Local 100&lt;/a&gt; (TWU) ended this morning at 06:00 EST (11:00 UTC) with no resolution or job action. The latest offer in the now bitter negotiation was from MTA: 3% pay increases per year in a three-year contract with changes in the health benefits and pension plan for new employees.

In a 12:30 EST (17:30 UTC) press conference, MTA President &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Kalikow"&gt;Peter Kalikow&lt;/a&gt; told the press that this would be the final offer the MTA would make because "there is no more." Kalikow continued that the MTA would be in dire straits in 2008 if they were to accept the TWU's demands, which included a 24% pay increase over three years and a reduced co-pay towards employees' health care premiums. He continued, "if they [the TWU] don't accept it, we will go to binding arbitration. This is our last offer."

Although most New Yorkers were geared up for a strike when the contract expired at 00:01 EST (05:01 UTC), the subways and busses continued to run their routes. An &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;AP&lt;/a&gt; report, later &lt;a href="http%3A//http%3A//twulocal100.org/%3Fq%3Dnode/525"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; by the TWU, calls for a limited strike with two deadlines: One at 00:01 EST Monday for the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.jamaicabus.com/"&gt;Jamaica&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http%3A//www.triborocoach.com/"&gt;Triboro&lt;/a&gt; bus lines, and one at 00:01 EST Tuesday for MTA &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City%20Subway"&gt;subways&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMTA%20New%20York%20City%20Transit%20buses"&gt;busses&lt;/a&gt;. 

Because they are run by private companies, a strike by the Jamaica and Triboro bus employees would not be subject to New York's Taylor Law, which prohibits public employees from striking and fines strikers two times their salary for each day the strike lasts.

Mayor &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Bloomberg"&gt;Michael Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt; commented that had the union begun its strike this morning, it would not have been as "damaging" as a Tuesday-morning strike. He also added "I thought that the MTA offer was more generous than what the municipal emplyees get offered." Governor &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Pataki"&gt;George Pataki&lt;/a&gt; reminded the union that the Taylor Law would be applied: "As I said yesterday, I have three words for the TWU: 'Don't do it.' If you strike, there will be very real consequences."

No talks were held today. Bargaining sessions are scheduled to resume tomorrow morning at the Grand Hyatt Hotel, Manhattan.

&lt;a href="w%3ASinn%20Fein"&gt;Sinn Fein&lt;/a&gt; has expel its former head of administration, &lt;a href="w%3ADenis%20Donaldson"&gt;Denis Donaldson&lt;/a&gt;, after he confessed to being a British spy since 1980.

Mr. Donaldson said he deeply regretted his activities over the last twenty years

In a statement to RTE News, he described the Stormont spying allegations as a sham. 

&lt;a href="wikt%3ATaoiseach"&gt;Taoiseach&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABertie%20Ahern"&gt;Bertie Ahern&lt;/a&gt; said the incident was 'as bizarre as it gets'. The UK government has been challenged for an inquiry over the matter.

"Blair needs to explain whether he knew Donaldson was an agent and, if not, how that could credibly be so," said Jim Allister of the &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Unionist%20Party"&gt;Democratic Unionist Party&lt;/a&gt;. "The Prime Minister should make a full statement to Parliament on Monday."

West Australian Police have begun a review of cold cases in their state following Bradley John Murdoch's conviction for the murder of British backpacker Peter Falconio.

Police believe that Murdoch from Broome, in northern Western Australia, could be responsible for the Claremont serial killings in Perth during 1996 and 1997. Police have also indicated that they will be exploring the possibility that Murdoch had been responsible for the disappearance of Hayley Dodd, 17 from Badgingarra and the disappearance of a woman from Broome in 1996.

Police will examine the details of the Falconio trial to construct a timeline of Murdoch's whereabouts. Police Sargeant Graham Clifford said "Murdoch's methodology and criminal profile were being scrutinised".

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Violence%20at%20Cronulla%20Beach%20as%205000%20people%20gather&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;a href="w%3ACronulla"&gt;Cronulla&lt;/a&gt; Beach in &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; was the scene of racist mob-violence yesterday. In what has been described as disgusting, un-Australian and shameful behaviour, participants in a 5000-strong mob assaulted people suspected of being of Lebanese origin. The angry, alcohol-fuelled crowd also turned on anyone who tried to help the victims, including police, security guards and ambulance officers. 

Following an attack on two &lt;a href="w%3Alifeguard"&gt;lifeguards&lt;/a&gt; earlier in the week, allegedly by men of &lt;a href="w%3Alebanese"&gt;Lebanese&lt;/a&gt; descent, a protest had been organised via &lt;a href="w%3Atext%20message"&gt;text messages&lt;/a&gt; and a small number of &lt;a href="w%3Ausenet"&gt;usenet&lt;/a&gt; postings. 

Sutherland Shire Mayor Kevin Schreiber says inflammatory text messages calling for revenge attacks fueled the violence. Mr Schreiber said the heavily-circulated messages ensured troublemakers went to the southern Sydney beach looking for a fight. Police had patrolled the area all weekend after text messages began circulating among the community calling for vigilante responses to unwelcome visitors on the beach.

"The sending out of that text message was foolish and irresponsible and ensured that people from all over Sydney came to Cronulla looking to cause trouble and this was further fueled by alcohol," said Mr Schreiber.

Sydney's popular talk-back radio station 2GB also promoted Sunday's event. Breakfast announcer Alan Jones has been accused of "fanning the flames." Callers who recommended vigilante action were not discouraged to take the law into their own hands. Mr Jones, notorious for inflammatory comments, repeated the text message for Cronulla residents to defend their territory several times.

As the crowd marched along the beach and foreshore area, waving Australian flags, the crowd chanted racist slogans, with many wearing clothes bearing racist sentiment. 

Middle Eastern men were openly targeted and assaulted. A young Muslim woman wearing a veil was chased into a kiosk on Cronulla beach. Police tried to move her away from the chanting crowd but were unable to reach the security of the command post. While the woman and police officers hid in the kiosk, a crowd surrounded the kiosk and shouted "Kill the Lebs", while others climbed on top of the kiosk.

As police horses and special operations officers formed a line and pushed the crowd away, they were bombarded with beer bottles. After half an hour, an ambulance arrived at the kiosk and people were loaded into it. The ambulance, transporting six injured youths, escorted by police and police horses, was also bombarded with beer bottles. One struck an ambulance officer on the head. His colleague suffered lacerations to the arm.

<h2>Arrests</h2>

A total of 25 people, including two ambulance officers, were injured and about 40 cars were vandalised at Maroubra as the unrest spread to other beachside communities. Police said 16 people had been arrested and charged with 41 offences. Locals said today they were in shock and many refused to be named, too scared of retribution for their comments.

Those charged were from Mortdale, Cronulla, Bondi Junction, Kareela, Granville, Lugarno, Greenacre, Mascot, Northmead, Jannali, Sutherland, and Riverwood. Offences included malicious damage, resist police, hinder police, assault police, resist arrest, possess prohibited drug, offensive manner, threaten violence, affray, possess knife in a public place, and driving in a manner dangerous. All of those charged were men between 17 and 40 years of age.

<h2>Government response</h2>
A Police strike force had been established to track down those responsible, NSW Premier Morris Iemma said today. Mr Iemma said video and photo evidence would be used to catch the offenders following incidents which he said showed "ugly face of racism in Australia".

He said the Government would examine what extra police powers would be needed to combat further outbreaks of violence. A meeting of community leaders would be convened to discuss the problem.

"Let's be very clear, the police will be unrelenting in their fight against these thugs and hooligans," the Premier said. A series of apparent revenge attacks – including two stabbings – occurred overnight following the unrest at Cronulla.

Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt;, at a separate press conference, condemned the violence. He said attacking anyone on the basis of their race or ethnicity was unacceptable and should be repudiated. He has refused to call Australians "racist". He himself created racism-related controversy when in 1988 he claimed that the rate of Asian immigration into Australia was too high.

<h2>Response from Islamic leaders</h2>

Kuranda Seyit, the director of Forum on Australia's Islamic Relations (FAIR), an Islamic think-tank, was disgusted by the weekends violence. "The Cronulla police must send a loud and clear message to others who are potentially considering vigilante action against fellow Australians," Mr Seyit said. He also condemned the previous violence that was allegedly committed by Lebanese men, but said that this does not justify yesterdays violence. "I realise that the initial behaviour by the thugs who beat the lifeguard was unacceptable but to take it out any anyone who the mob think are not one of them, is not the solution," Mr Seyit said.

He suggested that a number of people in Sutherland Shire were racist, and this contributed to the violence. "Obviously the underlying racism and intolerance in the shire is now bubbling to the surface."

<h2>Participation of "Neo-Nazis"</h2>
NSW Deputy Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione says police believed &lt;a href="w%3ANeo-Naz"&gt;neo-Nazi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20nationalist"&gt;white nationalist&lt;/a&gt; groups were among the crowd. "That in fact is something that we're following up," he told the Nine network. 

Skinheads wearing boots, braces and neo-Nazi emblems were among the protestors. Three far-right organisations: &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia%20First%20Party"&gt;"Australia First Party"&lt;/a&gt;, "&lt;a href="w%3APatriotic%20Youth%20League"&gt;Patriotic Youth League (PYL)&lt;/a&gt; and the Newcastle-based &lt;a href="w%3ABlood%20And%20Honour"&gt;"Blood and Honour"&lt;/a&gt; - all handed out pamphlets. PYL describes itself as a "radical nationalist" group with links to the German-based skinhead group &lt;a href="w%3AVolksfront"&gt;Volksfront&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Nationalist%20Party"&gt;British Nationalist Party&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20National%20Front"&gt;New Zealand National Front&lt;/a&gt;.

Australia First's Dr Jim Saleam, who was jailed for 3 1/2 years in 1991 for possessing a firearm and organising a shotgun attack on the home of the African National Congress's Australian representative, said: "I wouldn't condone it, but I wouldn't condemn it," Dr Saleam said his members had recruited up to 120 people for the rally but denied they were involved in violence.

Anti-race hate campaigner Matt Henderson-Hau, who runs the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.fightdemback.org"&gt;Fightdemback.org &lt;/a&gt; website, claims only one skinhead at the rally came from within the Sutherland Shire. "The rest came from the Central Coast, Newcastle and other parts of Sydney," he said. Mr Henderson-Hau said neo-Nazis had manipulated the crowd at Cronulla. "If you remove the Nazis from the equation, you will go a long way to dousing the flames and hopefully some cool heads will emerge on both sides," he said.

White Nationalist website, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.stormfront.org/forum/showthread.php%3Ft%3D253531%26amp%3Bpage%3D14"&gt;Stormfront Downunder&lt;/a&gt;, yesterday featured messages from people in the US, Britain and Canada supporting the Cronulla attacks.

<h2>Reaction from Sydney bloggers</h2>

Most bloggers were in agreement that anyone committing acts of violence should be arrested and punished, regardless of race, place of residence, or justification for their actions. Some are purely critical, whereas others are pointing to previous acts by Lebanese youths to explain the violence. 

"Round ‘em up—all of them, from both sides—charge ‘em, convict ‘em, jail ‘em," Tim Blair said. 

"Are we living in Tsarist Russia where peasants with pitchforks chase Jews down the street?" said Jason Soon of catallaxy. He made a distinction between these riots and previous riots, such as Maquarie Fields. "The denizens of Cronulla do not even have the excuse of poverty and deprivation for their actions. The infamy of disgrace will be heavier on them than on the people of Macquarie Fields."

One blogger said that he did not support Sunday’s violence, but argued that it was understandable after what he described as years of violence and intimidation by Lebanese youths. 

"This episode is an absolute disgrace. I, however, absolutely refuse to condemn the people who took that action yesterday, especially given the pattern of wilful inaction from the authorities over the last two years. Far from demonstrating intolerance (arguably, quite the opposite has been demonstrated here, given the facts), put quite simply, everybody has a limit," said James Ozark of "A Western Heart". 

Another blogger, who goes by the name "AnonymousLefty", issued a challenge to right-wing bloggers and mainstream pundits, asking them to explain how recent events should have been handled. "What precisely should we be doing differently in order to prevent flare-ups like Cronulla? (If Andrew Bolt and Piers Ackerman are going to devote their next columns to Cronulla - and I'd bet you the shiny biro on my desk that they will - perhaps they'd consider, instead of simply attacking 'multiculturalism' as a vague concept, actually suggesting what they'd do differently.)"

Splat Guy criticised the use of the national flag and anthem during the riot. "... the ugliest thing of all was the use of symbols of the unity of Australians - all Australians, not just Anglos - like the flag, national anthem, and sports cries as a sort of racial identifier. Really unsavoury, really unacceptable, really unaustralian."

<h2>Historical background: The White Australian Policy</h2>
Racism in post-invasion Australia dates back to the &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20Australia%20policy"&gt;White Australia policy&lt;/a&gt;, which started as government policy in the 1880s, became a national law with the creation of Australia as a state in 1901, effectively was stopped in 1973 under the prime ministership of &lt;a href="w%3AGough%20Whitlam"&gt;Whitlam&lt;/a&gt;, and was completed by further reform in immigration law under &lt;a href="w%3AMalcom%20Fraser"&gt;Fraser&lt;/a&gt; in 1978.

Photos have emerged in the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; media of a 9mm &lt;a href="w%3AToy%20weapon"&gt;imitation pistol&lt;/a&gt; being pointed at swimmers by a coach. The incident occurred at a swimming camp where a number of young swimmers were training for next year's &lt;a href="w%3ACommonwealth%20Games"&gt;Commonwealth Games&lt;/a&gt;.

At the camp, Nathan Schrag, a &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Australian%20Navy"&gt;Royal Australian Navy&lt;/a&gt; trainer, aimed the pistol at two swimmers whilst simultaneously firing a real pistol in the air. The two swimmers in question had just completed a two hour set.

It is believed that swimmers as young as 16 attended the camp. The officials responsible for the programme have stated that such methods will not be employed in the future. Meanwhile, &lt;a href="w%3ARod%20Kemp"&gt;Rod Kemp&lt;/a&gt;, the sports minister, has said that there is no place for such behaviour in sports training.

A &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Massachusetts%20Dartmouth"&gt;University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth&lt;/a&gt; senior was visited by federal agents in September, after he requested a copy of &lt;a href="w%3AQuotations%20From%20Chairman%20Mao%20Tse-Tung"&gt;Quotations From Chairman Mao Tse-Tung&lt;/a&gt;, which is colloquially known as "The Little Red Book".

History professors Brian Glyn Williams and Robert Pontbriand reported that the student requested the book through the university library via an interlibrary loan, which the Department of Homeland Security monitors. The agents apparently told the student that the book was on a watch list.

The student was writing a research paper on Maoist communism for Professor Pontbriand's class on fascism and totalitarianism. Government monitoring of library loans is often viewed as totalitarian practice.

"My instinct is that there is a lot more monitoring than we think," said Dr. Williams.

<h1>President Bush defends NSA domestic intercepts</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=President%20Bush%20defends%20NSA%20domestic%20intercepts&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
In a radio speech from the White House on 17 December 2005, &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; acknowledged that in the weeks following 9/11 he had "authorized the &lt;a href="National%20Security%20Agency"&gt;National Security Agency&lt;/a&gt; [NSA], consistent with U.S. law and the Constitution, to intercept international communications of people with known links to &lt;a href="w%3Aal%20Qaeda"&gt;al Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; and related terrorist organizations."

President Bush said that the government establishes a clear link to terrorist networks before intercepting these communications, adding that the purpose of the program is to "detect and prevent terrorist attacks against the United States and our allies."

Stating that terrorists inside the United States were communicating with terrorists abroad before the 9/11 attacks, President Bush said that the authorization he gave the NSA "helped address that problem in a way that is fully consistent with my constitutional responsibilities and authorities."

Secretary of State &lt;a href="w%3ACondoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; said that established procedures requiring court approval were simply not quick and flexible enough to respond to the urgency of the terrorist threat, and to allow the administration to eavesdrop on highly mobile targets in order to disrupt potential plots.

Before Bush's secret order, such wiretaps were obtained through the &lt;a href="w%3AForeign%20Intelligence%20Surveillance%20Act"&gt;Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act&lt;/a&gt; (FISA) of 1978. It prescribes procedures for requesting judicial authorization for electronic surveillance and physical search of persons engaged in espionage or international terrorism against the United States on behalf of a foreign power. FISA also allows the &lt;a href="w%3AAttorney%20General"&gt;Attorney General&lt;/a&gt; to grant permission for emergency wiretaps without a warrant, with retroactive application being made within 72 hours. Historically, the vast majority of applications are accepted without modifications by FISA. For example in the 2004 report of FISA to Congress it is noted that the number of approved warrants with substantive modifications was 94 out of a total of 1758 while 5 applications were rejected.

&lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20Intelligence%20Committee"&gt;House Intelligence Committee&lt;/a&gt; Chairman &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Hoekstra"&gt;Peter Hoekstra&lt;/a&gt; defended Bush's authorization of the surveillance program and to bypass the FISA. Chairwoman of the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Homeland%20Security%20and%20Governmental%20Affairs"&gt;Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee&lt;/a&gt; Senator &lt;a href="w%3ASusan%20Collins"&gt;Susan Collins&lt;/a&gt; announced a call on the NSA for a "full briefing" about the program, and said that the program's authority needs to be clarified. House Minority Leader &lt;a href="w%3ANancy%20Pelosi"&gt;Nancy Pelosi&lt;/a&gt; said Bush's radio address raised "serious questions as to what the activities were and whether the activities were lawful."

The President noted that the NSA activities are reviewed "approximately every 45 days." He added: "During each assessment, previous activities under the authorization are reviewed. The review includes approval by our nation's top legal officials, including the &lt;a href="w%3AAlberto%20Gonzales"&gt;attorney general&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AHarriet%20Miers"&gt;counsel to the president&lt;/a&gt;." All people involved in the periodic review are members of the executive branch.

Bush also said that NSA's activities under this authorization are thoroughly reviewed by the Justice Department and NSA's top legal officials, including NSA's general counsel and inspector general, adding that "leaders in Congress have been briefed more than a dozen times on this authority and the activities conducted under it." Members of Congress from both parties are now calling for congressional hearings to learn more.

The president concluded by saying that "this authorization is a vital tool in our war against the terrorists. It is critical to saving American lives. The American people expect me to do everything in my power under our laws and Constitution to protect them and their civil liberties."

&lt;a href="w%3AAlvaro%20Uribe"&gt;Alvaro Uribe&lt;/a&gt;, president of &lt;a href="w%3AColombia"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;, reportedly told the United States on Friday to stop meddling in the affairs of his country. The U.S. ambassador to Colombia asked the president to take steps to fight corruption that have plagued Colombian regional elections. Uribe stated that "the Colombian government does not accept the meddling of foreign governments, even if it is the United States."

U.S. ambassador William Wood gave a speech in which he claimed that many regional, including mayoral, races had gone unopposed due to bribery and intimidation. The ambassador blames rightist paramilitary groups for most of the offenses. Wood suggested that groups who continue to commit offenses despite the peace deal they signed should be stripped of the benefits they have received through that deal.

Uribe has been criticized by many human rights groups for going soft on paramilitary organizations. President Uribe's father was killed by leftist guerillas.

Uribe is a conservative politician and one of the United States closest allies in the region. The ambassador, William Wood, apologized for confusion made by his comments saying that "there was no intention to interfere in any way with Colombian elections, but rather to support the democratic, free, open and impartial process."

A former ambassador, Myles Frechette, suggests that because the president is up for re-election in May, he might want to demonstrate to the country that Colombia is a sovereign nation.

Australia's Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; has made an impassioned plea to restore the religious meaning of &lt;a href="w%3AChristmas"&gt;Christmas&lt;/a&gt;.

Mr Howard said he had "contempt" for arguments that the religious side of the Christmas season should be toned down by removing Christmas trees and symbols and nativity scenes. He said he had been saddened by the removal of Christmas trees and nativity scenes from public places.

It is thought that the reason behind the removal of traditional Christmas scenes was so that non-religious people and those of other faiths were not offended. Mr Howard said "You don't win tolerant brownie points by pretending to be something that you're not".

Backing Mr Howard, Catholic Archbishop of Brisbane John Bathersby said "We are a Christian country. If minorities are to integrate, they need something to integrate into. I don't think there is any intolerance in saying, 'This is who we are'".

The president of the Islamic Council of Queensland, Abdul Jabal, said "We don't celebrate Christmas but we support others doing so. It's a time of peace and sharing".

Opposition leader Kim Beazley used Mr Howard's comments to attack the government's industrial relations policy saying "I would say this to John Howard and to the Australian people about it, the biggest threat to Christmas in this country is John Howard's extreme industrial relations law". He added that people who wished to take time off work to celebrate Christmas have no rights to do so under the government's industrial relations reforms.

Survivors of the &lt;a href="w%3A7%20July%202005%20London%20bombings"&gt;London Bombings&lt;/a&gt; have urged the British public to write to their MPs, and set up an &lt;a href="http%3A//www.petitiononline.com/July7th/petition.html"&gt;online petition&lt;/a&gt; calling for an independent &lt;a href="w%3APublic%20Inquiry"&gt;Public Inquiry&lt;/a&gt; into the attacks.

52 people were killed and hundreds more injured on July 7th 2005 when four suicide bombers blew themselves up on three separate &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Underground"&gt;London Underground&lt;/a&gt; trains and a public bus.

Earlier this week the British government rejected calls for a Public Inquiry, arguing that such an investigation would be too expensive, take too long, and be a distraction from their efforts to combat terrorism. Instead, the government has offered to put together a "narrative of events".

But survivors of the attack argue that a fully comprehensive investigation could teach valuable lessons which may help reduce the likelihood of future attacks, and improve the response capabilities of the emergency services.

Some survivors, such as Rachel North (a pseudonym), who has been active in organising a support group for her fellow victims, have been angered by the government's alternative proposal of a "narrative". Writing on the weblog she started to help her, and others, come to terms with the aftermath of July 7th, Ms North says: 

"Even if you don't like the questions, don't like the answers, think you know the answers already, Mr Blair, it is us, not you, who are paying the cost for this... If the cost of answering questions makes you squirm, then too bad... We run the risks on the trains, the buses, the streets each day... How dare you presume you know our questions and how dare you presume that they can be answered by a 'narrative of what happened', as if we are children to be placated with a story. I know what happened, I want to know why."

Ms North also quotes a number of other survivors: 

"We are constantly reminded that this is the worst peace time bombing London has ever seen, for something that bad there should be an inquiry. People died, families lost someone they loved and hundreds are still suffering. You can't put a price on that but apparently the government can." - "Fiona"

"If nothing else, an enquiry would make sure some of these lessons were learnt in case, God forbid, anything like this happened again. I thought there were plansin place for emergencies such as this. Whilst the emergency services did a fantastic job on the day, I have been stunningly underwhelmed by the support offered to victims since." - "Pauline"

An anonymous survivor, writing on the "Yorkshire lass" website, says:

"'When I watched the Al-Qaeda video declaring Jihad against the UK I was haunted by the familiarity of the voice, it was my voice, my accent, my dialect. This is not a man who was recruited and trained in some far off country that I have barely heard of, this was a man who was recruited and trained while he lived 20 minutes from my mother's home where I was born and raised.The words he spoke of are words similar to what I have heard many times from disillusioned
young men that I studied for my A Levels with. They are the words of hatred I overheard when I worked as a support worker at my local college. They were words of students who were educated... when someone follows through with the actions of those opinions to the detriment of others, questions need to be asked why preventions were not put in place and this needs to be done by public inquiry for peace of mind.I have been told that I am looking for justice in the wrong place and in some way that is right. However, I want some sort of justice, some manner of peace of mind, some questions answered and resolutions made. I don't want others to have to go through what myself and hundreds of other commuters did on that Summer's day.'"

Relatives of the dead have also been very critical. Quoted on the BBC's website, Saba Mozakka, the daughter of Behnaz Mozakka,who died in the Piccadilly Line explosion, said:

"The families will be campaigning for there to be a full public inquiry... A narrative of events will not satisfy anybody. This is not something we will go away on." 

Marie &lt;a href="w%3ACasualties%20of%20the%207%20July%202005%20London%20bombings"&gt;Fatayi-Williams&lt;/a&gt;, whose son Anthony was killed in the attack, told the BBC: "I ask myself - if there is really nothing to hide then why shy away from a public inquiry? It is the only real way that we can truly get things discussed and see for ourselves what happened and what lessons can be learnt and whether we are better prepared now than on 7 July... I have a son who was killed and is never going to come back. Nobody is going to tell me that [an inquiry] is a waste of police time."

The survivors' &lt;a href="http%3A//www.petitiononline.com/July7th/petition.html%7Conline"&gt;petition&lt;/a&gt; has so far gathered over 100 signatures. The British government has given no response as yet.

This is an increase in 21 points since the last poll taken in August of this year.

Costa Rica is the only &lt;a href="Central%20America"&gt;Central America&lt;/a&gt;n country yet to ratify the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20American%20Free%20Trade%20Agreement"&gt;Central American Free Trade Agreement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (or CAFTA). Pacheco has sent the bill to the legislative branch for ratification but they are not expected to approve until April of 2006. CAFTA was supposed to go into effect on January 1, 2006.

The &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; archaeologist &lt;a href="w%3ASusanne%20Osthoff"&gt;Susanne Osthoff&lt;/a&gt;, who was abducted in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; on November 25th, has been freed. 

Her brother told &lt;a href="w%3An-tv"&gt;n-tv&lt;/a&gt; that she had been brought to the German embassy in &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt; and is well. Foreign minister &lt;a href="w%3AFrank-Walter%20Steinmeier"&gt;Frank-Walter Steinmeier&lt;/a&gt; confirmed the reports and said that her Iraqi driver, who was abducted along with her, is still in the hands of the kidnappers but they have promised to release him as well.

How she was freed, whether ransom was paid, or even which group abducted her is still unknown at this time. Steinmeier declined to answer any questions on the topic.

The captors demanded that the German government breaks off diplomatic relations with Iraq, which it has refused to do.

Osthoff had been living in Iraq since 1991. She is a converted Muslim and married to a Jordanian. Her 12-year old daughter is living in Germany. In recent years Osthoff became more and more involved with delivering aid to the Iraqi people. She was featured on the front page of the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Times"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; in 2003 &lt;a href="http%3A//select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html%3Fres%3DF50811F63D550C708EDDAC0894DB404482"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and appeared in a series about her work in the German daily &lt;a href="w%3AS%C3%BCddeutsche%20Zeitung"&gt;Süddeutsche Zeitung&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Diego%20Chargers"&gt;San Diego Chargers&lt;/a&gt; defeated the &lt;a href="w%3AIndianapolis%20Colts"&gt;Indianapolis Colts&lt;/a&gt; 26-17 at the &lt;a href="w%3ARCA%20Dome"&gt;RCA Dome&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AIndianapolis%2C%20Indiana"&gt;Indianapolis&lt;/a&gt;. It is the first loss of the season for the Colts, who are the fourth team in &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Football%20League"&gt;NFL&lt;/a&gt; history to win their first 13 games.

San Diego pulled ahead early, scoring a touchdown and two field goals in the first half. &lt;a href="w%3ANate%20Kaeding"&gt;Nate Kaeding&lt;/a&gt; kicked a 48-yard field goal in the third period to increase the Chargers' lead to 16 points, but Indianapolis responded with two touchdowns and a field goal in 6 minutes, giving the Colts a 17-16 lead.

Kaeding made a 49-yard field goal to put San Diego up 19-17 in the fourth quarter. The Colts' ensuing drive ended when rookie Chagers defensive tackle &lt;a href="w%3ALuis%20Castillo%20%28football%20player%29"&gt;Luis Castillo&lt;/a&gt; sacked Colts quarterback &lt;a href="w%3APeyton%20Manning"&gt;Peyton Manning&lt;/a&gt; putting Indianapolis out of field goal range. Chargers running back &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Turner%20%28football%20player%29"&gt;Michael Turner&lt;/a&gt; then scored a touchdown on an 83-yard running play, pushing San Diego's lead to 26-17 with two minutes left.

The Colts attempted a comeback but Manning was intercepted in the Indianapolis endzone, bringing to an end the game and the Colts' 13-game winning streak.

The win means the Chargers remain in close contention with the &lt;a href="w%3APittsburgh%20Steelers"&gt;Pittsburgh Steelers&lt;/a&gt;, who won in Minnesota, for an &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Football%20Conference"&gt;AFC&lt;/a&gt; wildcard spot. San Diego and Pittsbugh both have 9-5 records, however the Steelers won their head-to-head matchup which would searve as a tie-breaker. The Colts have already clinched top seed in the AFC.

"It's tough to go 16-0. You have to play well every week," said Colts coach &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Dungy"&gt;Tony Dungy&lt;/a&gt;. "The only consolation now is that we won't be asked all those questions, have all the media around and we can have more focus on our ultimate goal, to win the Super Bowl." The Colts no longer threaten the record set by the 1972 &lt;a href="w%3AMiami%20Dolphins"&gt;Miami Dolphins&lt;/a&gt;, the last NFL team to boast a perfect season.

The Colts (13-1) are in Seattle next Saturday to face the &lt;a href="w%3ASeattle%20Seahawks"&gt;Seahawks&lt;/a&gt; (12-2), and the Chargers (9-5) are in Kansas City to play the &lt;a href="w%3AKansas%20City%20Chiefs"&gt;Chiefs&lt;/a&gt; (8-6).

Hospital officials at Hadassah Ein Karem Hospital in &lt;a href="w%3AJerusalem"&gt;Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt; announced that &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israeli&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AAriel%20Sharon"&gt;Ariel Sharon&lt;/a&gt; suffered a temporary mild stroke Sunday evening.

"Our tests have shown that the prime minister had a mild CVA," (&lt;a href="w%3AStroke"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt;) said Dr. Yuval Weiss, a spokesman for the hospital. Sharon briefly suffered some minor physical symptoms including slurring of speech and loss of some motor control.

Sharon was reportedly returning to his ranch in the Negev desert when he told aides he was not feeling well. He was rushed to hospital and admitted shortly after 8pm (18:00 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;). The later statement of Dr Weiss stated that no invasive procedures were necessary.

Sharon's stay in the hospital is likely to be brief, some reports suggest he may be released in the morning although his personal physician, Boleslav Goldman has stated the stay may be three or four days. Despite hospitalisation, he is continuing to maintain full control of events in Israel.

Sharon has not previously suffered major health difficulties, although the BBC suggests
his stressful life and position may have contributed to the incident and surrounding scare.

&lt;a href="w%3AAleksander%20Kwa%C5%9Bniewski"&gt;Aleksander Kwaśniewski&lt;/a&gt;, a post-communistic ex-leader of the ♡❤Alliance of the Democratic Left♡❤ (Sojusz Lewicy Demokratycznej), will end his term as the president of &lt;a href="w%3APoland"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; within 5 days. His successor, conservative &lt;a href="w%3ALech%20Kaczy%C5%84ski"&gt;Lech Kaczyński&lt;/a&gt;, from the ♡❤Peace and Justice Party♡❤ (Prawo i Sprawiedliwość), is going to take the reins on December 23rd. This comes as the result of the October 9 elections and the October 23 run-offs, when he defeated liberal &lt;a href="w%3ADonald%20Tusk"&gt;Donald Tusk&lt;/a&gt; by 54% to 46%.

Although Kwaśniewski has quite a good reputation in Polish society, he has often been called irresponsible and very static. That was said by some, especially from nationalistic and populist parties, such as ♡❤Peace and Justice♡❤, and ♡❤Self-Defense♡❤ and ♡❤League of Polish Families♡❤, candidates in the last elections (both parliamentery and presidential), who had been promising people a strengthening of the position of Polish president. 

The last weeks of Kwaśniewski's second term were marked by the issuing of some pardons to people related to the post-communistic left.

Kwaśniewski, who took over the presidency after the election of 1995, and then was re-elected in 2000, is the successor to Solidarity movement leader &lt;a href="w%3ALech%20Wa%C5%82%C4%99sa"&gt;Lech Wałęsa&lt;/a&gt;. He was unable to stand for re-election again as the Constitution of Poland states that the Polish president can only be re-elected once.

&lt;a href="w%3AVice%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;United States Vice President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADick%20Cheney"&gt;Dick Cheney&lt;/a&gt; made a surprise visit to &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; today promoting the recent &lt;a href="w%3AIraqi%20legislative%20election%2C%20December%202005"&gt;Iraqi election&lt;/a&gt;, amidst an upsurge of violence that has killed more than 30 people. The Vice President's visit was so secretive that even Iraqi prime minister &lt;a href="w%3AIbrahim%20al-Jaafari"&gt;Ibrahim al-Jaafari&lt;/a&gt; was unaware he was coming.

In a visit lasting 10 hours, Mr. Cheney met with military commanders and Iraqi politicians as he was shuttled between locations including the heavily fortified Green Zone in Baghdad and the Al Asad air base in Anbar province west of Baghdad, travelling by a group of eight armed helicopters. 
Cheney commented on the recent elections, stating that "I think what started here in Iraq will have an enormous impact through the region," and "We're, as Americans, very proud to be part of that."

Later, Cheney took questions from 30 troops in a large tent. "From our perspective, we don't see much as far as gains," Marine Cpl. Bradley Warren told Cheney. I was wondering what it looks like from the big side of the mountain -- how Iraq's looking."
"Well, Iraq's looking good," Cheney responded. "It's hard sometimes, if you look at just the news, to have the good stories burn through. Part of it is that what we're doing here, obviously, takes time from our perspective, looking back, as I say, to a year and a half ago, I think it's remarkable progress. I think we've turned the corner, if you will. I think when we look back from 10 years hence, we'll see that the year '05 was in fact a watershed year here in Iraq."

Cheney's visit was marred by a surge in violence after a relatively quiet period following the elections. Nearly two dozen people, including two police officers, died Sunday in a combination of suicide bombings and insurgent attacks.

A &lt;a href="w%3AVirginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; recreation and fishing boat launch on the &lt;a href="w%3A%20James%20River%20%28Virginia%29"&gt;James River&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href="w%3ADominion%20Virginia%20Power"&gt;Dominion Virginia Power&lt;/a&gt; plant at &lt;a href="w%3ADutch%20Gap"&gt;Dutch Gap&lt;/a&gt; is the scene of too many &lt;a href="w%3A%20American%20Black%20Vulture"&gt;Black Vultures&lt;/a&gt;, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Virginia Department of Inland Game and Fisheries.

In 2002, more than 350 Black vultures were killed at Dutch Gap in an effort to reduce their numbers to a level of a couple dozen birds. But they made a quick come back in the area, and during this past week a hundred of the birds have been disposed of by a shot to their head with a pellet gun.

The USDA reports that both Black Vultures (Coragyps atratus), along with their close relatives called the &lt;a href="w%3ATurkey%20Vulture"&gt;Turkey Vulture&lt;/a&gt; (Cathartes aura), are experiencing population increases stretching well over the last 10 years. 

The species is increasingly a problem by growing into being a nuisance, as well as a threat to health and safety concerns. The presence of the birds in large numbers, at places they roost, can cause damage to property as they peck and claw at construction surfaces, and cause unsanitary human health conditions from the defecation and regurgitation of the birds. Their presense at landfills, often in near proximity to airports, is a problem for airplanes during take-off and landing. 

At the entrance to the Dutch Gap boat launch parking lot, a large yellow warning sign is posted that reads: ♡❤"Please be aware of possible damage to vehicles and trailers due to the large Black Vulture population currently inhabiting this parking area. Because the Black Vulture is a federally protected species, Chesterfield County is working with the U.S. Deptartment of Agriculture and the Virginia Department of Inland Games and Fisheries to resolve the problem. You can help by disposing of all litter (even non-food items such as cigarette butts) in trash barrels.

Some public services in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia's&lt;/a&gt; most populous state, are shutting for extended periods over Christmas and New Year in an effort to save money.

Public hospitals are cancelling elective surgery for periods of up to six weeks. The &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Newcastle%2C%20Australia"&gt;University of Newcastle&lt;/a&gt; has forced all staff to take annual leave and has ceased its core functions of research and teaching for three weeks.

A NSW Health spokesperson has defended its decision to keep quiet about the shutdowns, saying "They [NSW Health] don't want to release any more information - we are telling the public enough." The NSW president of the Australian Medical Association, John Gullotta, disagrees saying "We are losing up to three months of the year in shutdowns." He went on to say "A lot of it is about cost savings - they will blame the holidays, but it is about reining in costs."

According to the University of Newcastle its shutdown "is, at this stage, a one-off event." Further, "the primary objective of the Christmas close down is to reduce leave accruals." Earlier in the year the University laid off 412 staff in an effort to reduce costs.

The New York Times has reported that &lt;a href="w%3AEvo%20Morales"&gt;Evo Morales&lt;/a&gt; has won presidential &lt;a href="w%3Aelections"&gt;elections&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ABolivia"&gt;Bolivia&lt;/a&gt;. Morales ran on a campaign of restoring coca farming in Bolivia, in spite of the United States' program to wipe out coca growing (in an effort to reduce the cocaine business). Morales is an Aymara Indian and former coca farmer himself. Morales described his victory as a signal that "a new history of Bolivia begins, a history where we search for equality, justice and peace with social justice."

At 9pm last night &lt;a href="w%3AJorge%20Quiroga"&gt;Jorge Quiroga&lt;/a&gt; conceded defeat saying, "I congratulate Evo Morales." The National Electoral Court had yet to confirm the votes as of Sunday night, but Morales is expected to win easily. According to the Bolivian media based on exit polling, Morales is expected to receive 51 percent of the vote, compared to 30 percent for his nearest rival, Jorge Quiroga.

Evo Morales' government will be the first to be led by an indigenous president in the nation's history. Morales' left of center policies, especially his support for the coca industry will likely not make him a popular Latin American figure for the Bush administration in the United States, who might be afraid of a closer alliance between Morales, Hugo Chávez in Venezuela, Fidel Castro of Cuba, and even the more moderate but still left-of-center Luiz Lula da Silva of Brazil.

Morales has commented saying that under his administration there will be "zero cocaine, zero narco-trafficking but not zero coca." In addition to being against the U.S. policy of coca extermination, Morales is also against many of the neoliberal policies of the past Bolivian governments, including free trade agreements. However he might have some difficulty getting through his new programs as the Movement Toward Socialism party to which he is a member did not win control of the congress.

Roger Williams, a UK Member of Parliament, has called for emergency action to ban the artificial sweetener &lt;a href="w%3AAspartame"&gt;Aspartame&lt;/a&gt; (aspartamine), questioning its safety. The MP said that there was "compelling and reliable evidence for this carcinogenic substance to be banned from the UK food and drinks market altogether."

Reservations of some U.S. Food and Drug Administration scientists about the safety of Aspartame were overridden when the agency initially approved the food additive in 1981, but many other countries followed the U.S. lead in endorsing the chemical sweetener for general public use. Aspartame has been linked in various studies cited by Mr. Williams to brain tumors, anxiety attacks, neurological impairment and other side effects, particularly in experimental animals; however, several reviews by government agencies have found no credible proof of such risk to humans and no country has banned or limited the substance for human consumption and such non-governmental groups as the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Cancer%20Society"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Heart%20Association"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt; assert that extensive investigation has not shown any serious adverse effects attributable to Aspartame. Nonetheless, organized groups continue to debate the issue vigorously and there are calls for class action law suits. The initiative by MP Roger Williams may now bring the debate into the open political arena of the House of Commons.

New research on combining Aspartame with other common food additives suggests that while each substance alone may be safe enough, some combinations frequently found in commercial products interfere with the development and function of the nervous system in rats. (Lau, et al.) Few, if any, other experiments with combinations have been conducted. On the other hand, surveys of human populations, which consume Aspartame in various combinations with artificial colorings and flavorings, have failed to convincingly show significant harm.

Aspartame is sold under the brand names of Equal, Nutrasweet and Canderel and is an ingredient of thousands of "diet" or "lite" products.

A number of rallies were held in Sydney on Sunday to protest against what they describe as racism in the community. The &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Union%20of%20Students%20of%20Australia"&gt;National Union of Students&lt;/a&gt; organised an event at Town Hall, and the &lt;a href="w%3ATed%20Noffs%20Foundation"&gt;Ted Noffs Foundation&lt;/a&gt; held an event in Belmore Park later in the day. About 2,000 people marched through Sydney, and there were also gatherings in Newcastle, Brisbane, and Melbourne. 

Lebanese Australian student Chadi Sankary rejected alcohol as an excuse for racist and violent behaviour. "People are not willing to admit that this is about racism," he said. "You can't be under the influence of alcohol and paint your massive banners with racial slogans on them or you can't make t-shirts while you're drunk so it can't be accepted as an excuse."

Matt Noffs, of the Ted Noffs Foundation, said that the solution to racism lies with the people, not politicians. He also criticised the weeks police operation, saying that it will not provide a long-term solution. "I don't feel that the responses that have been made during the week have actually helped the situation," he said. "They might have suppressed some of the violence that is sure to happen in these situations anyway but they certainly don't look at the solutions."

Tim Longhurst, one of the organisers, said that the rally showed the true nature of Sydney as a tolerant city. "What we saw today wasn't new. Sydney has always been a place where people do get along, and today they came out in force to show that," Mr Longhurst said.

In a statement supporting the rally, &lt;a href="w%3ASocialist%20Alliance%20%28Australia%29"&gt;Socialist Alliance&lt;/a&gt; linked the &lt;a href="w%3A2005%20Sydney%20race%20riots"&gt;Cronulla riots&lt;/a&gt; to government policies and actions. "The riots reflect the rising racism in Australia, a tide that has been fostered by the Howard government’s policies and propaganda that criminalise and lock up refugees, dehumanise and bomb the Iraqi people, and define all Muslims and Middle-Eastern Australians as potential terrorists."

One Sydney blogger criticised the rallies because they focused on racism against minority groups such as Lebanese, instead of racism in general. "They're picking on only one face of the disgusting racism that has come to a boil in this city recently, and tried to say they're taking a stand against racism," he said, calling the rally "the racist anti-racism protest."

Larry Robinson resigned as coach of the New Jersey Devils on Monday afternoon because of stress-related health issues. Devils president and general manager Lou Lamoriello will take over the coach position temporarily until the new coach would be brought "as soon as possible".

"Stress is a killer," Mr. Robinson said during the announcement. "I lost a dear brother last year and that changed my thoughts about life a lot. My parents are no longer around. I want to be able to enjoy my kids. I worked and I played for 20 years so I could give everything I wasn't able to have for myself to my children, and they suffered for my absence."

Robinson, who coached Devils to 2000 Stanley Cup championship and 2001 Stanley Cup Finals, returned to coach the Devils last July after Pat Burns was diagnosed with cancer.

"A lot of things were getting to me. I want this team to be successful, but if I can't be at my best and it's bothering me healthwise, I can't do that," Robinson said.

Robinson's resignation is the second NHL coaching change this season, following Eddie Olczyk's dismissal by the Pittsburgh Penguins last week.

54-year-old Robinson missed 2 games this month with flu and sinus problems, he said that he already underwent tests, including an CAT test because of continuing "horrible headaches".

China is developing and enacting a long term space program aimed at cultivating and proving the country’s scientific abilities. The project is heavily research based and includes plans extensive manned missions and a modular space station. However the ultimate goal is lunar based.

The Chinese hope to develop its own pollution free fuels that may be used in high capacity rockets that may be able to launch upwards of 25 tons into space. The program has plans for a moon based astronomical telescope and extensive research of the moon’s geology. Ouyang Ziyuan, who heads the moon research program, has explained one particular interest is the helium-3 isotope. Helium-3 is thought to have great capacity for a reliable, non-polluting fuel source.

Their recent Shenzhou 6 mission sent two astronauts into orbit for 5 days. The Shenzhou 7 mission expects to launch three astronauts into space in 2007. Subsequent missions include plans for launching parts of their space station and eventually. The Chinese intend to man their orbiting space station with Shenzhou 10. By 2006 the Chinese hope to launch the Chang’e 1 lunar orbiter which is designed around a Chinese commercial satellite. They intend to follow up with landlers and sample collection as early as 2017.

Started in 1992, the Chinese space program has made rapid progress. Shenzhou 6 was their second manned mission and cost China roughly 110 million, quite inexpensive when compared to the space missions of other countries. The programs extensive plans hint that now, more than ever, the program’s progress is heavily dependent on funding. In 2004 the Chinese budget was 1.8 billion, almost a 30% less than in 1999 and tiny compared to NASA’s spending potential, upped to 16.5 billion for 2006. The space program realizes that it must fit into the country's grander scheme.

Hu Shixiang, deputy commander in chief of China’s manned space program told CNN that the Chinese are not competing with other countries in their space research, denying any comparison to the Cold War space race. He said China is willing to put for international cooperation in their space research.

Australian Treasurer &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Costello"&gt;Peter Costello&lt;/a&gt; is facing controversy for the second time in three weeks following the release of a treasury document circulated on October 6, 2005, claiming that the government's Work Choices Act could suppress labour productivity in the short-term.

In November, 2005, when questioned in parliament Costello denied that any report or modelling had been done by the Treasury. When speaking on ABC Radio, Costello claimed that the document is a "minute" not a report and therefore he did not mislead parliament. He later went on to say that the "report" had cemented the government's claim that the industrial relations reforms will have economic benefits in the long term. Costello further explained that a key phrase in the minute, relating to job numbers, was misprinted, and should read "jobs should not fall" instead of "jobs should now fall".

The report also stated that under the new system minimum wage increases are likely to be smaller than those made in the past by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABank%20of%20Italy"&gt;Bank of Italy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Governor &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAntonio%20Fazio"&gt;Antonio Fazio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has resigned today, Monday December 19, after several months of crisis. He is suspected of malpractice concerning the takeover of the bank Banca Popolare Italiana. The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Central%20Bank"&gt;European Central Bank&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has raised questions over allegations that Fazio accepted gifts from the Pop Italiana's former CEO, Gianpiero Fiorani. Fiorani, suspected of embezzlement, was arrested last week.

The news was welcomed by many Italian politics. The European Central Bank President &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJean-Claude%20Trichet"&gt;Jean-Claude Trichet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said he "fully respected" Fazio's decision.

Rocket company &lt;a href="SpaceX"&gt;SpaceX&lt;/a&gt;, notorious for repeatedly pre-announcing its first flight on Wikinews, cancels its latest attempt and defers further flights until 2006.

This latest launch attempt on the 19th December was cancelled due to structural issues with the first-stage fuel tank of the Falcon 1 rocket. An electrical fault caused a valve to shut inappropriately, and as fuel drained out a vacuum was created causing the side of the fuel tank to buckle inwards.

<h1>NYC Transit on strike</h1>

Calling it a "fight for dignity on the job, a concept foreign to the MTA," &lt;a href="w%3ATransport%20Workers%20Union"&gt;Transport Workers Union Local 100&lt;/a&gt; (TWU) President Roger Toussaint officially declared that its union members are now on strike, extending the job action, and bringing the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City%20Subway"&gt;subways&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMTA%20New%20York%20City%20Transit%20buses"&gt;buses&lt;/a&gt; of New York City to a halt.

&lt;a href="w%3AMetropolitan%20Transportation%20Authority%20%28New%20York%29"&gt;MTA&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Kalikow"&gt;Peter Kalikow&lt;/a&gt; and Toussaint took part in last night's negotiations, where the final offer to the TWU was made. The MTA offered a three-year contract with a 3 percent, 4 percent, and 3.5 percent pay-raise schedule and a retirement age that would stay at 55, but new employees would have to pay more in contributions to the pension and health care plan.

Toussaint had said earlier today to striking &lt;a href="http%3A//www.jamaicabus.com/"&gt;Jamaica&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http%3A//www.triborocoach.com/"&gt;Triboro&lt;/a&gt; bus operators that he could not accept the MTA's offer because it did not address disciplinary actions that the MTA could levy against their employees. Jamaica and Triboro busses began striking 00:01 (05:01) Monday morning. Both bus lines are privately owned and operated, but their employees are TWU members and will become part of the MTA's bus service in 2006.

The TWU had asked the MTA to give its last, best offer by 21:00 Monday (02:00 Tuesday UTC) so that executives would be able to evaluate the terms in time to avert the Tuesday morning strike deadline. But when Toussaint and Kalikow parted last night at 23:00, any hope of preventing the incredible turned into awaiting the inevitable strike declaration.
At his 03:02 press conference, Toussaint pointed the finger squarely on the MTA.

"With a US$1B surplus, the contract between the MTA and TWU Local 100 should have been a no-brainier. Sadly that has not been the case. From the beginning, the MTA approached these negotiations in bad faith, demanding arbitration before even trying to resolve the contract. Hours before contract expiration, the MTA got rid of its US$1B surplus -- a surplus which we believe continues to be understated by some US$100M. The MTA knew that reducing health and pension standards at the authority would be unacceptable to our union. They knew there was no good economic reason for their hard line on this issue - not with a US$1B surplus."

Then, the words that no one in New York City (except maybe public school students whose classes were delayed by two hours) wanted to hear passed from Toussaint's lips: "The Local 100 Executive Board has voted overwhelmingly to extend strike action to all MTA properties effective immediately."

The strike was "on."

Mayor &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Bloomberg"&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt; lashed out at the TWU with his harshest language yet on the strike. "For their own selfish reasons, the TWU has decided that their demands are more important than the law, the City and the people they serve. This is not only an affront to the concept of public service; it is a cowardly attempt by Roger Toussaint and the TWU to bring the City to its knees to create leverage for their own bargaining position." His Honor concluded, "We cannot give the TWU the satisfaction of causing the havoc they desperately seek to create." 

Mayor Bloomberg estimated the cost of the strike at US$400 million per day.

This morning the Mayor crossed the Brooklyn Bridge into Manhattan, alongside his fellow commuters-turned-pedestrians. But the bitter wind coming from the East River only doubled the frigid mood of the already freezing New Yorkers: TWU members were picketing on the Brooklyn entrance to the bridge.

<h2>Contingency Plans</h2>
<h3>The MTA</h3>

The strike contingency page on the MTA website mirrored Kalikow's statement to the press: "The TWU announced it would conduct an illegal strike on MTA NYCT buses &amp; subways throughout all five boroughs as well as on most MTA Bus Company routes. This is in addition to a strike action called at 12:01 Monday, December 19, 2005 by the TWU against two private bus lines in Queens: Triboro Coach &amp; Jamaica Buses."

In his press conference Kalikow said "The TWU's action today is illegal and irresponsible. This blatant violation of the &lt;a href="w%3ATaylor%20Law"&gt;Taylor Law&lt;/a&gt;... it is a slap in the face to all MTA customers and all New Yorkers."

Although contingency plans had been in ready since Friday, some aspects have not materialized. &lt;a href="w%3AWINS-AM"&gt;1010 WINS&lt;/a&gt; has reported that &lt;a href="w%3ALong%20Island%20Rail%20Road"&gt;LIRR&lt;/a&gt; service for the &lt;a href="w%3AShea%20Stadium"&gt;Shea Stadium&lt;/a&gt; park-n-ride will not be in service until 09:00 because the equipment needed to run on the strike contingency schedule has not been put in place.

The LIRR will be making additional stops in Queens on the Main Line, as well as operating shuttle trains between &lt;a href="w%3AJamaica%20%28LIRR%20station%29"&gt;Jamaica&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APennsylvania%20Station%20%28New%20York%20City%29"&gt;Penn Sta.&lt;/a&gt; and in Brooklyn between Jamaica and &lt;a href="w%3AFlatbush%20Avenue%20%28LIRR%20station%29"&gt;Flatbush Ave.&lt;/a&gt;. Riders going to or coming from &lt;a href="w%3AFlushing%2C%20Queens"&gt;Flushing&lt;/a&gt;, which is normally served by the &lt;a href="w%3A7%20%28New%20York%20City%20Subway%20service%29"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt; train, can take the LIRR to Flushing/Main St. on the &lt;a href="w%3ALong%20Island%20Rail%20Road%23Port%20Washington%20Branch"&gt;Port Washington&lt;/a&gt; branch.
All riders are advised that several entrances to Penn Station have been designated for ticketed passengers only and are specific to the passenger's servicing branch. Non-ticketed passengers should enter Penn Sat. through the 7th Avenue entrance.

The MTA assures its customers that all contingency service will be in place no later than the Wednesday morning rush, and that any holders of 7-day, 30-day, and Unlimited &lt;a href="w%3AMetroCard"&gt;MetroCard&lt;/a&gt;s will have their expiration dates extended for as many days as the strike lasts.

<h3>The City</h3>

At 05:00 &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City%20Police%20Department"&gt;NYPD&lt;/a&gt; put roadblocks into action along 96 St., south of which only high-occupancy vehicles carrying at least four passengers ("&lt;a href="w%3A%20High-occupancy%20vehicle"&gt;HOV&lt;/a&gt;-4") may enter. &lt;a href="http%3A//1010wins.com/bios/local_bio_060101713/"&gt;John Montone&lt;/a&gt; reported that even commercial vehicles are subject to the HOV-4, including taxis. This lead to some early-hour contingency "confusion and kvetching". Taxis are allowed to pick up multiple fares.

The city has reserved the following streets for emergency vehicles only, weekdays from 05:00 to 20:00 :
<ul>
BULLET::::- 5th Ave. and Madison Ave. between East 23 St. and East 96 St.,
BULLET::::- 26, 29, 49, and 50 streets from river to river, and
BULLET::::- Church St. and Trinity Pl. south of Barclay St.
</ul>
A detailed list of restrictions, closures, and lane reversals can be found on the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.nyc.gov/html/transitinfo/html/driving_restrictions.shtml"&gt;NYC.gov&lt;/a&gt; website.

<h3>The Port Authority</h3>
The &lt;a href="w%3APort%20Authority%20Trans-Hudson"&gt;PATH&lt;/a&gt; is reported to be operating normally, which is shuttling riders from 34th Street/Herald Sq. to the Wold Trade Center, and all stations in-between.

&lt;a href="w%3AAirTrain%20JFK"&gt;AirTrain&lt;/a&gt; is also in operation, which serves Jamaica Sta. and &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20F.%20Kennedy%20International%20Airport"&gt;JFK&lt;/a&gt; airport. An unconfirmed report from one commuter suggested that taxis from the airport are still honoring the airport's "Anywhere in New York" flat fare.

<h3>The TLC</h3>
The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City%20Taxi%20%26amp%3B%20Limousine%20Commission"&gt;Taxi and Limousine Commission&lt;/a&gt; (TLC) has set up a system of flat fare zones and maximum prices for taxis, livery, and vans. Livery cab drivers announced that they would operate service along striking bus routes in order to fill in the service gap, and cabbies are allowed to pick up multiple fares for the duration of the strike. &lt;a href="w%3ANY1"&gt;NY1&lt;/a&gt; has reported instances of price gouging, leaving New Yorkers in the difficult position of deciding whether to sacrifice $50 or schlepp in the bitter cold.

<h2>THQ signs with Massive Network</h2>

THQ has signed a deal with the advertising company Massive Network. Massive Network is a broker that places advertising into online games. The ads are unique in that they can change over time like billboards on the highway. In a game about rescuing hostages a hero might walk past Coca-Cola machine's one week and Pepsi the next. He may pick up a newspaper with ads for real companies in it. Advertisers get an audience, game makers get extra revenue, and game players get more realistic games. Nokia, Vivendi, Paramount, Panasonic, Warner Bros, Universal Music and Honda have already signed on. Game makers Sony, Ubisoft, and Atari have signed on as well.
Massive Network says it has over 100 titles committed to carrying its ads.

<h2>Texas's largest utility, TXU, offers Internet over power lines</h2>

Texas's largest utlity, TXU Corp., in a deal with Current Communications Group plans to offer high speed Internet access over power lines in the state. TXU has agreed to pay Current Communications Group approximately $150 million over 10 years to use Current's BPL network. In the deal TXU will become an equity holder in the privately held Current. Current's other shareholders include Google Inc. and another US utility company Cinergy Corp. The deal will offer access to 2 million homes and businesses mostly in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Construction is planned to start in 2006 along TXU's 14,000 miles of transmission lines and 100,000 miles of distribution lines. Current's only existing Internet access customers are through Cinergy, where it charges between $20 to $45 monthly for speeds up to 3 megabits per second.

Before the holiday started, American &lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20televangelist"&gt;Christian televangelist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJerry%20Falwell"&gt;Jerry Falwell&lt;/a&gt; has asked that &lt;a href="w%3AChristians"&gt;Christians&lt;/a&gt; across America boycott &lt;a href="w%3ATarget%20Corporation"&gt;Target Corporation&lt;/a&gt; department stores for their refusal to include "Merry Christmas" in advertisements or store decore, instead opting to use the more inclusive phrase, "Happy Holidays."

Target was not the only recipient of criticism, as &lt;a href="w%3ACostco"&gt;Costco&lt;/a&gt; and several other stores have used similar greetings during the 2005 holiday season. Falwell and the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Family%20Association"&gt;American Family Association&lt;/a&gt; have threatened to boycott Target and Costco for not using the phrase "Merry Christmas" explicitly.

In a similar debate, the decorated spruce at Capitol Hill in Washington D.C. was known as a "Holiday Tree" earlier this year, but was renamed "Christmas Tree" after objections by &lt;a href="w%3ASpeaker%20of%20the%20House"&gt;Speaker of the House&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADennis%20Hastert"&gt;Dennis Hastert&lt;/a&gt; (R-IL).

Delta Electricity, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales'&lt;/a&gt; second largest electricity producer has increased security at its four plants near &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; following an extortion threat.

Delta Electricity operates &lt;a href="w%3AFossil%20fuel%20power%20plant"&gt;coal-fired power plants&lt;/a&gt; at Wallerawang and Mount Piper (near Portland) in the state's Central West with Mummorah and Vales Point both between Sydney and Newcastle.

Delta reportedly received the letter last week which is said to contain a threat to bomb one of the plants if a "multi-million" dollar payment was not received. Jim Henness, Chief Executive of Delta Electricity denies that the letter threatened to bomb company facilities or harm employees. He did concede that Delta has undertaken responses "for the protection of people and plant".

New South Wales Police have set up Strike Force Wayside investigate the threat. Members of the strike force have been working with Delta to help identify the source of the extortion demand.

The mayor of Lithgow, Neville Castle said that residents were nervous. He said "Obviously there's concern in the community"

"We'd look at it very dimly however to my mind it wouldn't be concerned with terrorism activity because as far as I am aware, terrorists don't forecast what they are goring to do in advance. It seems to be very sudden as to what they do."

Lithgow is located close to Wallerawang and Mount Piper plants and a large number of residents are employed at the plants or in the local coal mines that supply them.

Exactly one year since the popular &lt;a href="w%3ASuprnova.org"&gt;Suprnova&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABitTorrent"&gt;BitTorrent&lt;/a&gt; link site went offline, its founder, &lt;a href="w%3AAndrej%20Preston"&gt;Andrej Preston&lt;/a&gt; (known as "Sloncek" to the Internet community), has spoken out about what happened on his website.

After twelve months of speculation amongst former users and many sites popping up to try and take its place, Preston says "it is time for everybody to know the truth and that it is time for me to stop pretending like nothing ever happened".

According to Preston his nightmare began in November, 2004 when he received a phonecall from his ISP stating that Preston's servers had just been raided. Preston claims that at this time he had no communication from the police.

After reading about himself in various Slovenian newspapers in early December, Preston decided to take his suprnova.org site offline. At the same time another project Preston was involved in eXeem was touted as being the biggest thing to happen to file sharing.

Preston claims that a month or so after his site went offline his home was raided by the police at 6:30 in the morning. Police seized two computers and documents. Preston was then called into the local police unit another month later for a hearing. Preston, on the advice of his lawyer decided he would not answer anything during the interview with the police. At the conclusion of the interview Preston was told that the matter would be handed over to the prosecutor.

Preston recalls that on October 18, 2005 he received a notice to go to the post office and pick up another letter which he must sign for. Upon receiving the notice Preston says that he "became completely depressed and sad". Preston however was greeted with good news at the post office when he opened the letter and discovered that his matter had been dropped. He also received his computers and CDs back.

<h2>Background</h2>
The BitTorrent protocol uses .torrent metadata files that tells a client application which tracker to contact to find peers (users sharing the file) and verification data for the files to be downloaded. It was thought to be "safer" than traditional file sharing systems from a legal perspective as the files (possibly copyrighted material) were not hosted on a centralised server but were instead located completely on users' computers.

Due to the nature of BitTorrent a server is required to "track" (assist in locating other peers). These trackers can be a legal target because they "assist" in distributing the data. It is also quite easy for the administrator of a BitTorrent tracker to remove torrents and stop users from downloading them.

&lt;a href="w%3AeXeem"&gt;eXeem&lt;/a&gt; on the other hand was to be completely decentralised. There was no need for centralised trackers, as each peer on the network acted as a tracker by assisting other clients in finding peers. eXeem had a rather difficult time becoming accepted within the internet community following the discovery of &lt;a href="w%3ACydoor"&gt;Cydoor&lt;/a&gt; adware in the software. Development on eXeem has since ceased.

Suprnova itself was not a BitTorrent tracker nor did it host the actual files being downloaded by the user. Suprnova made available the .torrent meta data files needed to locate a tracker and peers.

A new telephone &lt;a href="w%3Aopinion%20poll"&gt;poll&lt;/a&gt; conducted December 17 and 18 has predicted another minority &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt; government under &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20prime%20minister"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Martin"&gt;Paul Martin&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20federal%20election%2C%202006"&gt;upcoming federal elections&lt;/a&gt;. The poll was conducted by &lt;a href="w%3APollara"&gt;Pollara&lt;/a&gt;, a Canadian public opinion and research company. Of those polled, 37% responded that they would likely vote for the Liberals, 34% &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Conservative&lt;/a&gt;, 17% &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;New Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; and 10% for the &lt;a href="w%3ABloc%20Qu%C3%A9becois"&gt;Bloc Québecois&lt;/a&gt;.

The results show a drop in the Liberals' initial lead, from 7 points to 3, and it puts the Liberals and the Conservatives within the polls margin of error of 3.7%. However, the report indicates that much of that decline is a result of &lt;a href="w%3AAlberta"&gt;Alberta&lt;/a&gt; residents increasingly in favour of the Conservatives, led by &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt;. Given Alberta's seat apportionment in &lt;a href="w%3Aparliament%20of%20Canada"&gt;parliament&lt;/a&gt;, Conservative gains on their established plurality there are not enough to have a major effect on the seat totals. Although the &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Green Party&lt;/a&gt; has announced they will be running members in every &lt;a href="w%3Ariding"&gt;riding&lt;/a&gt;, their results were not reported by Pollara.

In its analysis of the results, Pollara commented that "&lt;nowiki&gt;[t]&lt;/nowiki&gt;he electorate has rarely been so polarized as in this election. If only rural Canadians were voting, we would have a Majority Conservative Government. If only urban Canadians were voting, we would have a Minority Liberal Government. Women would elect a Liberal Majority, while men would select a Conservative Minority. Young Canadians, 18-24, would easily elect an NDP majority". Pollara also indicated that the Bloc Québecois would win a clear majority among voters in &lt;a href="w%3AQuebec"&gt;Québec&lt;/a&gt;.

Pollara conducted the study by telephone and polled 1208 people. Only those who indicated they were very likely to vote were asked what party they would likely vote for. 708 respondents were asked their potential endorsement and the poll is accurate to 3.7% plus or minus.

Canadians are scheduled to vote January 23, 2006. This early election stemmed from the ruling Liberal Party government's loss in a &lt;a href="w%3Amotion%20of%20no%20confidence"&gt;motion of no confidence&lt;/a&gt;. The Liberal government has faced strong opposition from the NDP, Conservatives and Bloc Québécois as a result of an embarrassing &lt;a href="w%3ASponsorship%20scandal"&gt;sponsorship scandal&lt;/a&gt;.

An opinion poll taken in Haiti from November 6 through 16th shows that former President &lt;a href="w%3ARen%C3%A9%20Pr%C3%A9val"&gt;René Préval&lt;/a&gt; leads the race of likely presidential candidates with 30% of those polled. However disqualified candidate &lt;a href="w%3ADumarsais%20Sim%C3%A9us"&gt;Dumarsais Siméus&lt;/a&gt; received 34% of those polled, signalling that if Siméus were declared eligible it could be a tight race between those frontrunners. Siméus was declared ineligible in September due to his dual citizenship with Haiti and the United States. In December the Haitian Supreme Court ruled &lt;a href="Haitian%20Supreme%20Court%20rules%20Simeus%20eligible"&gt;for a second time&lt;/a&gt; that Siméus is eligible under the &lt;a href="Haitian%20constitution"&gt;Haitian constitution&lt;/a&gt;. However the electoral council said that due to the ballots already being printed, Siméus could not be added in this election cycle. It should be noted that the poll was taken by a political organization called The Democracy Group, a political consulting firm hired by the National Organization for the Advancement of Haitians, a group for the restoration of democracy in Haiti to which Siméus is a member of. However a partner of the polling firm, Shawnta Watson Walcott, says that Siméus had nothing to do with the polling procedures and was not involved in any other way.

The poll also showed that among eligible candidates, &lt;a href="w%3ACharles-Henry%20Baker"&gt;Charles-Henry Baker&lt;/a&gt; received 7%, &lt;a href="w%3AMarc%20Bazin"&gt;Marc Bazin&lt;/a&gt; received 5%, and &lt;a href="w%3AEvans%20Paul"&gt;Evans Paul&lt;/a&gt; received 5%. Also on the poll was the question of whether Siméus should appear on the ballot, to which 54% said that he should. When questioned with whom they trust most to lead the country, 31% said that Préval is that person. The polling is said to have a margin of error of 3.7% plus or minus with 703 Haitian voters questioned.

The Independent Electoral Commission of &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; (IECI) reported uncertified early returns in the &lt;a href="w%3AIraqi%20legislative%20election%2C%20December%202005"&gt;Iraqi legislative election&lt;/a&gt;. The preliminary numbers indicate that religious parties have done well, winning up 80 percent of the vote in some provinces. In Baghdad province, the &lt;a href="w%3AShia%20United%20Iraqi%20Alliance"&gt;Shia United Iraqi Alliance&lt;/a&gt; leads with 58% of the vote. The United Alliance had received 1,398,778 votes, followed by the Sunni Arab Iraqi Accordance Front with 454,107 votes, and the Iraqi National List ticket of &lt;a href="w%3AIyad%20Allawi"&gt;Iyad Allawi&lt;/a&gt;, the former prime minister, with 330,082 votes. 

In the Kurdish dominated Northern provinces of &lt;a href="w%3ADohuk"&gt;w:Dohuk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AErbil"&gt;w:Erbil&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ASulaymaniyah"&gt;w:Sulaymaniyah&lt;/a&gt;, the Kurdistan Coalition List had received between 87% and 95% of votes cast. In the southern province of Basrah the Shia United Iraqi Alliance held a commanding lead with 615,255 votes. Allawi's group was in second place with 87,538 votes, while the Iraqi Accordance Front trailed with 37,098. 

According to the IECI, these preliminary results are subject to the adjudication of complaints by the IECI Board of Commissioners. Following the adjudication of complaints, only results certified by the IECI Board of Commissioners will be considered as final. Election officials are investigating more than 1,000 complaints about irregularities, 20 of them considered serious. Final results will not be released until early January. Abdul Husain Hindawi, the head of the IECI dismissed calls for a re-vote by Adnan al-Dulaimi, one of the leaders of the National Concord Front coalition.

Gonzales is accused of secretly agreeing to pay $11 million in city funds to waste disposal company Norcal Waste Systems, without notice or approval by the city council. The scandal has already resulted in an independent investigation, civil grand jury proceedings, Gonzales's censure by the council, and council members calling for his resignation or removal from office.

In a statement responding to the DA's investigation, Gonzales announced he has hired Allen Ruby, a high-profile Silicon Valley attorney, to represent him in this matter. Ruby has previously represented the National Football League in lawsuits against Oakland Raiders owner Al Davis. Gonzales's statement also supported the decision of the DA to conduct further investigations into the city's contract.

Two trains have collided at Roccasecca, 120km south of &lt;a href="w%3ARome"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt; in the Frosinone province of &lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;.

Initial reports claimed 30 injured, with people trapped in the wreckage. A BBC report however suggested there could be at least 40 injured. Two people have been reported missing since the collision occurred, possibly being the two drivers of the trains. One person was reported killed.

The incident is already under investigation by the Italian authorities and the Italian state Railway Operator, &lt;a href="w%3ATrenitalia"&gt;Trenitalia&lt;/a&gt;. As yet the reasons for the collison are unclear.

Relief efforts are being made difficult by the dark and cold weather.

The two trains were travelling on the same line, in the same direction, with different destinations. The first one (regional train number 3361) departed from the Roma Termini station, in &lt;a href="w%3ARome"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt; at 13:47 and was a local service to Cassino, stopping at the major stations along the route. The scheduled time of arrival was 15:38. The second train (inter-regional 2361) also left from the Rome terminus, at 14:15, and was heading in the same direction, with a final destination of Campobasso. The scheduled time of arrival was 17:27, and the first stop first stop was at Cassino, scheduled at 15:42.

Around 15:00 the first train had stopped at the station of &lt;a href="w%3ARoccasecca"&gt;Roccasecca&lt;/a&gt;, and was just to restart its journey, when the second train came at high speed on the same rail, slamming into the back of it. The locomotive of the second train was pushed over the first train and landed on the last carriage of that train. The injured were taken to local hospitals for treatment.

A similar incident recently happened in Southern Poland.

The train service has been suspended over the line. Long distance trains are reroutered on an alternative line (the one which pass through Formia, Villa Literna e Caserta

It has been alleged that the second train passed a red signal. However no evidence about that has been collected to support this at present. An operator of the railway stated that the signal should have been red, but what he has said came from what he saw on the control panel inside the station, he did not see the colour of the signals. The two train drivers of the second train said that they did not see red signals, but only green signals. It was alleged that the train has been misrouted. Actually if the second train had to pass the station without stopping and overtaking the first train it seems resonable that it would pass on a different track. Hovewer the railway authority has confirmed that there has been no error in this sense, because both trains were scheduled on the platform 2.

Several union representatives of the railways employed claim the security system on most of the Italian railways is not updated.
The line was not serviced by an advanced security system to automatically help the driver. Works to implement a more modern security system were just made on the line and the new system would be ready in just some days. Nevertheless even if the line were equipped by a modern security system, it would be of no help in this case. The locomotive of the second train was a very old locomotive, a diesel locomotive of type 668, with no equipment to dialog with modern security system.

The inauguration of the new "high speed" line between Rome and Naples was in program just for the day after the crash. The inauguration have been delayed.

<h2>Casualty Updated (Dec. 22)</h2>
The official number of the casualties has risen to 69, and the number of the fatalities has risen to 1 (one of the injured, Antonio Vallillo, has passed away on December 22).

The &lt;a href="w%3ABah%C3%A1%26amp%3B%23039%3B%C3%AD"&gt;Bahá&amp;#039;í&lt;/a&gt; International Community has claimed that a Bahá&amp;#039;í has died in mysterious circumstances in jail in &lt;a href="w%3AYazd"&gt;Yazd&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;.

Dhabihu'llah Mahrami was arrested in 1995 and convicted by an Iranian court of "apostasy" - converting from Islam to another religion. He was sentenced to death, but following protests from the international community the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in 1999.

Mahrami was a lifelong Bahá&amp;#039;í, who was fired from his civil service job after the Iranian revolution in 1979 on grounds of his religion. An article later appeared in a local newspaper stating he had converted to Islam, but Mahrami claimed this had been written by colleague and he had always remained a Bahá&amp;#039;í. After he had repeated this publicly, he was arrested and charged with apostasy. Iranian authorities later claimed he was jailed for spying for Israel, but this was contradicted by the court documents.

The Bahá&amp;#039;í community claims that Mahrami had no known health concerns at the time of his death, but had been forced to do arduous labour in prison and had received death threats. They say they hold the Iranian authorities responsible for his death and his only crime was belief in his religion.

They claim the Bahá&amp;#039;í community in Iran has suffered an increase in persecution this year, with 59 Bahá&amp;#039;ís arrested so far.

<h2>US wholesale prices fall by 0.7%</h2>

The Producer Price Index for Finished Goods declined 0.7% in November. The Index rose 0.7% in October and rose 1.9% in September. The drop in price for finished goods is due to energy prices,
which fell by 4% percent. The Index is seasonally adjusted.

<h2>China is now the sixth largest economy</h2>

China has raised its GDP estimate after a year long survey. China has outplaced Italy becoming taking sixth largest economy in the world. World economists now calculate that China's economy will be larger than the economy of the United States, the current largest economy. Economists also predict that China will pass France and the UK by the end of 2006. Service industries such as telecommunications, retailing, and real estate accounted for 93% of the revision. Economists also say that this means that China's growth is more sustanable than previously thought which means pressure will mount on China on other issues including its currency valuation and trade negotiations.

An Australian man arrested last December near the Cambodian border in Vietnam, Trinh Huu, has been sentenced to death by a Vietnamese People's Court for smuggling 2kg of heroin. Amnesty International has urged the Australian Federal Government to do everything it can to help the man. The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs has said that Trinh was receiving consular assistance, but that it was too early to negotiate for clemency as his case is still subject to appeal. The government has reiterated its long standing opposition to the death penalty.

Indonesian Fisheries Minister Freddy Numberi has asked the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20government"&gt;Australian government&lt;/a&gt; to stop burning Indonesian boats found fishing illegally in Australian waters. His Australian counterpart, Senator &lt;a href="w%3AIan%20Macdonald%20%28Australian%20politician%29"&gt;Ian Macdonald&lt;/a&gt;, has said that the practice will continue. "The law is that we are required to offer the boats back on payment of a bond somewhere between $4,000 and $10,000, and if the owners don't pay that in 28 days then the boat's forfeited to the Australian Government," he said. "We have no use for them and we destroy them and we'll continue to do that." 

The boat owners, who often come from poor backgrounds, generally can't afford to pay and are then deported. While waiting for a decision one fisherman has died &lt;a href="http%3A//news.sbs.com.au/insight/archive.php%3Fdaysum%3D2003-08-21"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; . Under a 1974 agreement with Australia, traditional Indonesian fishermen are permitted to take fish within a 12 nautical mile radius of Ashmore Reef, Cartier Island, Scott Reef, Seringapatam Reef and Browse Island. Often the fishermen caught are traditional fishermen who navigate by the sun, stars and with the wind, so with no visible borders, they often mistakenly fish in illegal waters.

Some fishermen are professionally profiteering on catching sharks for their valuable fins while throwing away the rest of the sharks body. There is even confusion as to who could be defined as a "traditional fisherman" and who is just profiteering illegally. Fisherman who persist and get caught more than once can end up in detention.

Professor &lt;a href="w%3AIan%20Harper"&gt;Ian Harper&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="w%3AFourth%20Howard%20Ministry"&gt;government&lt;/a&gt; appointed &lt;a href="w%3Aworkchoices"&gt;Fair Pay Chief&lt;/a&gt; has come under heavy criticism this week from the Labour groups and the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;federal opposition&lt;/a&gt;. 

Professor Harper was a &lt;a href="w%3Anon-executive%20director"&gt;non-executive director&lt;/a&gt; of the Australian Derivatives Exchange (ADX) when it was put under administration in March 28, 2001. The &lt;a href="w%3Acorporation"&gt;company&lt;/a&gt; went broke owing workers more than $700,000. In the process ADX breached the &lt;a href="w%3ACorporations%20Act%202001"&gt;corporations law&lt;/a&gt; by failing to maintain required &lt;a href="w%3Acash%20reserves"&gt;cash reserves&lt;/a&gt; , although the company eventually gave workers their &lt;a href="w%3Aentitlements"&gt;w:entitlements&lt;/a&gt;.

Workplace Relations Minister &lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Andrews"&gt;Kevin Andrews&lt;/a&gt; appointed Professor Harper in October, Mr Andrews spokesman Defended the appointment saying the government was aware of the economist's history with the company and said in relation Professor Harper role in ADX ’s demise: 
"There has been absolutely no wrongdoing," 
"The government was made aware by Prof Harper, and also by doing a check ourselves, of the company going into administration.”
"We believe that Prof Harper is an eminently qualified person to head up the Australian Fair Pay Commission."

&lt;a href="w%3AWayne%20Swan"&gt;Wayne Swan&lt;/a&gt; the Oppositions treasury, who has attacked the government over the &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Gerard"&gt;Robert Gerards&lt;/a&gt; appointment to the reserve bank affair,&lt;a href="w%3Aspokesman"&gt;spokesman&lt;/a&gt; has said there were serious questions to answer about Prof Harper's appointment.
"There is a pattern of behaviour here and a stench that surrounds the Howard government,".
"This is a government whose actions and appointments are blinded by extreme ideology." Mr Swan said commenting on the recent history of important government appointments. 

&lt;a href="w%3ASharan%20Burrow"&gt;Sharan Burrow&lt;/a&gt; the president of the &lt;a href="w%3AACTU"&gt;ACTU&lt;/a&gt; has told ABC radio that the government must better scrutinize Mr Harper’s business behaviour. "How on earth can they expect Australians to have any faith in their so-called &lt;a href="w%3AFair%20Pay%20Commission"&gt;Fair Pay Commission&lt;/a&gt; if the very head they've appointed, another government mate, is under a cloud,"

In a debate that took place Sunday, sponsored by the U.S. embassy, two potential presidents cited security as an important priority for Haiti after the presidential election. They referred to the presidential election as the ♡❤restoring of democracy♡❤, although the role of the &lt;a href="w%3AUSA"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt; in terminating the previous democratic period is disputed, in particular because United States marines and other security personnel escorted and flew the previous democratically elected &lt;a href="w%3AJean-Bertrand%20Aristide"&gt;Jean-Bertrand Aristide&lt;/a&gt; out of Haiti in circumstances which Aristide refers to as ♡❤kidnapping♡❤. One candidate, &lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Henri%20Baker"&gt;Charles Henri Baker&lt;/a&gt; stated that "economic development will never come to this country without security," alluding to both the economic situation on the island, where growth has been minimal in the last couple of years, and the security situation involving some areas of the country and even areas of the capitol as not being under police control.

Baker added that if elected he planned to quadruple the police force and reinstate the army. The army had been dismantled, with wide popular support, by Aristide, because of its massive and systematic &lt;a href="w%3Ahuman%20rights"&gt;human rights violations&lt;/a&gt;. Baker's goal is to have the police force up to 20,000 officers. Another candidate, &lt;a href="w%3AEvans%20Paul"&gt;Evans Paul&lt;/a&gt; agreed saying that "the priority is to create the conditions of economic growth," and pledging to bring inflation down from the 22% in 2004 down to below 10%.

<h1>NRMA stands by &quot;unsafe&quot; smash repair system</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=NRMA%20stands%20by%20%26quot%3Bunsafe%26quot%3B%20smash%20repair%20system&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;a href="w%3ANRMA"&gt;NRMA&lt;/a&gt;, one of Australia's largest insurers, has come under scrutiny following the release of a scathing report into its online smash repairs system.

The report by the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; Government's Staysafe committee found that NRMA's online repair tendering system was "unsafe". NRMA has said it has no intention of suspending the system despite the findings.

The report, which was released yesterday found that "[The] system of allocating damaged motor vehicles to smash repairers without the repairers physically inspecting the damaged vehicle before quoting for work ... is an unsafe system in its current form". According to committee member and Port Stephens MP John Bartlett the vehicles were "being repaired to the standard of a brick and the crumple zones at the front and rear no longer worked and all the impact was being felt in the cabin".

According to the report "the system would lead to cost cutting and unsafe repair practices, with the quality of repairs lowered by encouraging smash repairers to take short cuts". 

According to NRMA, only minor "cosmetic" repairs are put through the system - however often there can be further damage which is only evident after a complete inspection. The NRMA system simply places photographs of the vehicles on its website where approved smash repairers bid to carry out repairs.

David Brown, head of claims and assessments at NRMA, said this of the report: "[W]e totally reject the findings of the report, in fact we find the report's fundamentally flawed with no evidence of safety issues, and [it] has been prepared without seeing the system first-hand". He further added that the system would not be scrapped.

<h1>Indian Ocean tsunami, one year after</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Indian%20Ocean%20tsunami%2C%20one%20year%20after&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
One year on from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2004%20Indian%20Ocean%20earthquake"&gt;Indian Ocean tsunami&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the world's grief and compassion returned to the tsunami-battered coastlines of the Indian Ocean, where at least 216 000 people lost their lives. Under a clear sky and before a gentle sea, the world commemorated those lost their lives, in one of the worst natural disasters that the modern world has experienced.
Since the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2004%20Indian%20Ocean%20earthquake"&gt;Indian Ocean tsunami&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , patchy progress has been made on the return to a normal life for those who lived through the experience. Efforts to implement a warning system similar to that coordinated by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Tsunami%20Warning%20Center"&gt;Pacific Tsunami Warning Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHawaii"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have past a number of significant milestones. Tourist resorts in many places have been rebuilt, and many visiting them at this time do so as a form of remembrance. Yet still there remain those who may never recover from the tragic events of one year ago. Some $13 billion was pledged to relief and recovery efforts, of which 75 percent has already been secured.

<h2>Banda Aceh</h2>
In one of the first ceremonies, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIndonesian%20President"&gt;Indonesian President&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASusilo%20Bambang%20Yudhoyono"&gt;Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; joined in a moment of silence at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABaiturrahman%20mosque"&gt;Baiturrahman mosque&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; located in a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABanda%20Aceh"&gt;Banda Aceh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; coastal suburb flattened by the disaster. Yudhoyono said that "was under the same blue sky, exactly one year ago, that Mother Earth unleashed her most destructive power upon us, The assault began with a massive earthquake but ... that was only a prelude to the horrific catastrophe to come." 

In a live video address &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUN"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASecretary%20General"&gt;Secretary General&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said "The toughest time after last year's devastating tsunami may be yet to come, It was so brutal, so quick, so extensive that we are still struggling to fully comprehend it."

<h2>Andaman and Nicobar archipelago</h2>
Many of the survivors of the tsunami who live in the Andaman and Nicobar islands have yet to see significant benefits from international relief efforts. Over 10,000 families are having to come to terms with the policies of their government. Whilst local people would be happy to continue with traditional wood and bamboo materials, disputes see the government trying to impose higher standards.

<h2>Thailand</h2>
In &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the anniversary of the massive wave sees tourists returning and reconstruction of resorts. However, not all is so positive. Many who lost loved ones suffered from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APost-traumatic%20stress%20disorder"&gt;Post-traumatic stress disorder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and whilst 75% of those suffering are said to be recovered, those who still suffer may need life-long psychiatric help. In &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APhang-nga%20province"&gt;Phang-nga province&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the hardest hit part of Thailand, there are around 300 people in that category, their symptoms including a deep-seated fear of the sea. Binge drinking has also become a problem among many who lost everything, including family, when the disaster struck.

In an attempt to focus on a recovery from the trauma inflicted on the children of Thailand, concerned parties have published a number of children's books aimed at rehabilitating. Sponsored by the Canadian Embassy, ♡❤The Day the Tsunami Came♡❤ tells the tale of a boy who loses his father when the wave hit his fishing village in Phanag-nga province. Its aim is to spread the message to those affected that they are not alone. Apart from publication in Thai and English, the book will be available in Swedish, Dutch, Indonesian and Singhalese.

Measures to prevent a recurrence of the massive casualties have been implemented in the year following the tsunami. Earlier this month Thailand's tsunami early warning system passed its first official test. National Disaster Warning Centre Director Plodprasop Suraswadi stated, "Thailand is the first country in the region to successfully install a comprehensive tsunami early warning system. I believe the system can, from now on, save lives and assets of Thais and international tourists alike". The centre is due to be expanded in the coming year to cover "natural disasters [such] as severe floods, forest fires and even air pollution." Implementation of the tsunami warning system has not all gone according to plan. Earlier in the month a false alarm caused by a technical error panicked tourists and local residents in the six provinces hit by the disaster, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKrabi%20Province"&gt;Krabi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Phang-nga &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APhuket%20Province"&gt;Phuket&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARanong%20Province"&gt;Ranong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASatun%20Province"&gt;Satun&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATrang%20Province"&gt;Trang&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThaksin%20Shinawatra"&gt;Thaksin Shinawatra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and a member of the royal family who lost her son were among those who spoke in the resort island of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APhuket"&gt;Phuket&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the source of some of the most graphic footage of the incoming waves. Thousands attended ceremonies held in Phuket and other affected parts of the country, observing periods of where flags were lowered to half-mast and bells rung in remembrance.

Some villagers refused to take part saying the rites were expensive, inappropriate, events designed to attract tourists and showcase the government.

<h2>Europe</h2>

Across Europe; hundreds joined in commemorating those who died. In &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which suffered the highest loss of life for any country outside of Asia, official ceremonies were held, with more Swedes attended ceremonies in Thailand.

After months of threats from the states to take the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGovernment%20of%20Australia"&gt;federal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; government of &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHigh%20Court%20of%20Australia"&gt;High Court of Australia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; over its Work Choices Act, &lt;a href="New%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; has formally lodged a writ with the High Court. Other states have indicated that they will follow the New South Wales government's lead.

The 30-page Statement of Claim lodged by NSW Industrial Relations Minister John Della Bosca and Solicitor-General Michael Sexton claims that the Work Choices Act is unconstitutional as the act extends the commonwealth's powers beyond what the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AConstitution%20of%20Australia"&gt;constitution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has given them. The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;Howard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; government has argued that they have such powers under the corporations provision of the constitution. Mr Della Bosca argues that the corporations provision is there to protect individuals from corporations.

Mr Sexton said "The heart of the Commonwealth legislation is its reliance on the corporations power, and the question is whether that is valid in these circumstances. In other words, whether it's possible to legislate in effect about industrial relations simply because the employer is a trading or financial corporation".

The Howard government's plan effectively collapses the state's industrial relations systems, which differ greatly from the new system.

&lt;a href="US"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;Representative&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Conyers"&gt;John Conyers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMichigan"&gt;MI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) has brought three resolutions to the &lt;a href="US%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House&lt;/a&gt; which could begin a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acensure"&gt;censure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; process of President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush&lt;/a&gt; and Vice President &lt;a href="Dick%20Cheney"&gt;Cheney&lt;/a&gt;, and begin an investigation. 

The first of the three resolutions, H.RES.635, would create a select committee to investigate the Administration's intent to go to war before congressional authorization, manipulation of pre-war intelligence, encouraging and countenancing torture, retaliating against critics, and to make recommendations regarding grounds for possible impeachment. 

The second, H.RES.636, calls for Censuring President George W. Bush for failing to respond to requests for information concerning allegations that he and others in his Administration misled Congress and the American people regarding the decision to go to war in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , misstated and manipulated intelligence information regarding the justification for the war, countenanced torture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment of persons in Iraq, and permitted inappropriate retaliation against critics of his Administration, for failing to adequately account for specific misstatements he made regarding the war, and for failing to comply with Executive Order 12958.

The third, H.RES.637, calls for censuring Vice President Richard B. Cheney for reasons similar to those outlined in H.RES.636.

Rep. Conyers is the sole sponsor of all three resolutions, but Rep. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Lewis%20%28politician%29"&gt;John Lewis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeorgia%20%28US%20state%29"&gt;GA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) has joined Conyers in calling for an investigation of President Bush's handling of pre-war intelligence. Lewis released a statement Monday 12/19/05 using strong language to condemn the president. "In my opinion, the President has violated the law, and the House and Senate must pursue their inquiries into this illegal program."

The conduct by a group of 'Santas' making an unclear statement last Saturday is not appreciated in the business district of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAuckland%2C%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Auckland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;. The event, organized in the discussion forum of an online skateboard magazine, caused big media publicity.
Alex Dyer, spokesman for the group, stated that &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASantaCon"&gt;Santarchy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in Auckland is part of a worldwide phenomenon. It is disputed if Santarchy is a protest against the commercialization of &lt;a href="Christmas"&gt;Christmas&lt;/a&gt; or not.

Auckland Central Police spokesperson Noreen Hegarty said to the press that the rampage began in the early part of the afternoon when men wearing ill-fitting Santa costumes threw beer bottles and urinated on cars from an overpass, then rushed through a central city park, overturning garbage bins, throwing bottles at passing cars and spraying graffiti on office buildings.

"They came in, said 'Merry Christmas' and then helped themselves," said a convenience store staff member Changa Manakynda, according to local newspapers.

One writer using the pseudonym ♡❤♡Le_SigNagE' on the Santarchy!♡❤ (or also known as the ♡❤Santacon♡❤) website commented, "... after all, this is what Christmas is really about… mindless vandalism and petty theft." 

Another writer who posted under the pseudonym ♡❤Santy Claus♡❤ said of the media coverage,
"There was some major misreporting and Chinese whispers. Breaking bottles and urinating under a bridge, became throwing rocks at buses and urinating on cars from an overpass. The ‘organisers’ as they were, saw little in the way of crime other than one santa attempting to board a foreign vessel by scaling 20 metres along a rope 60 feet in the air. The difficulty and motor skills involved in this task alone should be a defense in itself of being 'drunk' and 'disorderly'."

Due to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASanta%20Claus"&gt;Santa's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; reputation for integrity and his strict media policy, his sparse communication is mostly one-way: receiving lists from children with wishes for Christmas. It is difficult to get his comment about New Zealands skateboard interested 'Santas'.

In 1994, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACacophony%20Society"&gt;Cacophony Society&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; staged the world's very first &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASantaCon"&gt;SantaCon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in San Francisco. Influenced by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Asurrealist"&gt;surrealist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; movement &lt;a href="Discordianism"&gt;Discordianism&lt;/a&gt;, and other subversive art currents.

On a state run talk show in Cuba, they dedicated 90 minutes to an attack on U.S. diplomat Michael Parmly. They accused him, among other things, of "having frequent contacts with his mercenaries, guiding them, supplying them and exhibiting them to the press," according to host Randy Alonso.

This is sparked by Parmly, according to the associated press, "after he met with dissidents and charged that some communist supporters acted like Nazi "brown shirts" or Ku Klux Klan members." Parmly is accused of being part of a plan in the United States to spark a rebellion with dissidents and/or to find justification to invade the nation. At a December 10 gathering to celebrate Human Rights Day Parmly gave a speech saying, "the Cuban regime does not represent the people, nor does it have any interest in bettering their lives," and "rather, the regime is obsessed with self-preservation."

Parmly replaced James Cason whose position is blamed by Cuban officials for the imprisonment of 75 dissidents with whom Cason had contact. The talk show features journalists and government officials who took turns discussing Parmly's actions in Cuba calling the diplomats, according to one journalist Arlene Rodriguez, "They are the same pig with different suits," and "The pig is Bush's policy and they are the suits."

The environmental activist group &lt;a href="Greenpeace"&gt;Greenpeace&lt;/a&gt; has attempted to disrupt &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;'s Southern Ocean "scientific" whaling fleet. After searching for the whaling fleet for nearly a month, the Greenpeace ships, MY Esperanza and MY Arctic Sunrise, are floating alongside the Japanese mothership in &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;'s Antarctic territorial waters, directly south of &lt;a href="Tasmania"&gt;Tasmania&lt;/a&gt;.

The Japanese whaling fleet has an expected catch of over 900 &lt;a href="w%3AMinke%20Whale"&gt;minke whales&lt;/a&gt; – more than double its previous catch. The fleet - owned by Kyodo Senpaku and part-owned by Nissui, Japan's second-largest marine products firm - is also targeting endangered &lt;a href="w%3AFin%20whale"&gt;fin whales&lt;/a&gt; for what they claim is a scientific program. Fin whales are the second largest creatures on earth.

Greenpeace say they have asked the whalers to stop whaling immediately and return to Japan, but have received no response from the vessels. In inflatables carrying banners which read "defend the whales" and "stop the whaling," crew from the two ships declared their intention to stop the hunt. 

Leader of the Greenpeace expedition, Shane Rattenbury said their eight small boats have begun to "interfere" with the whaling process. 

"We positioned our two ships to the stern of the Japanese mother ship in order to prevent the whale being transferred on to the ship and we were successful in stopping that process for about 45-minutes," said Mr Rattenbury, describing a capture boat ramming the Greenpeace ship in an attempt to push it clear. 

He said the Japanese boat fought back with water cannons and one of several Greenpeace inflatables capsized in the wash. All crew were retrieved without injury. 

"We're going to do everything we can over the coming weeks to interfere with the whaling process, and stop the whales being killed," he said, "our small boats will be putting themselves between the harpoon and the whale. 

In a radio call to the whaling vessels, from the bridge of the Arctic Sunrise, Yuko Hirono, of Greenpeace Japan called upon the whalers to stop killing whales "and leave the internationally recognised Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary." Japan's scientific whaling has been the subject of repeated criticism by the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Whaling%20Commission"&gt;International Whaling Commission&lt;/a&gt;. 

The &lt;a href="w%3AInstitute%20of%20Cetacean%20Research"&gt;Japanese Institute of Cetacean Research&lt;/a&gt;, claim the amount of scientific data gathered by Japan's research program (JARPAII) is extensive and that Japan's whale research programs are conducted in accordance with the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Convention%20for%20the%20Regulation%20of%20Whaling"&gt;International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling&lt;/a&gt;. The Institute of Cetacean Research say their research does not involve illegal whaling.

Greenpeace say over the next 2 years, 40 more fin whales will be added to the annual kill, along with 50 humpback whales. 
"This whale hunt is unnecessary, unjustified, and unwanted," said Rattenbury. "Once the whales have been measured and weighed by the 'scientists' the butchers get to work and the whales are cut up and boxed for market. This is all about money and not science."

The area in which the Japanese fleet is hunting has been designated as the Antarctic Whale Sanctuary, in an effort to allow whale populations to recover after stocks were depleted during the commercial whaling of the last century. 

Seventy crew and campaigners from 19 countries are on board the two Greenpeace vessels, including the UK, Netherlands, Canada, Australia, Ghana, Russia, Norway, Denmark, USA, France, Italy, Japan, Ireland, India, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, Austria and Argentina.

Japan's whaling program is expected to kill nearly one thousand whales this season.

Preliminary results from the National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL), released 15 December 2005 by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Center%20for%20Education%20Statistics"&gt;National Center for Education Statistics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , indicate gains and losses in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="wikt%3Aliteracy"&gt;literacy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; among minority adults between 1992 and 2003.

The nationally representative study among US adults age 16 and older found the over-all average prose and document literacy remained relatively unchanged, but quantitative literacy improved 8 points (on a scale of 500.) Results among minorities were mixed, with White and Asian/Pacific Islander minorities scoring significantly higher than Hispanic or Black ethnicities; Hispanic subjects in particular had sharp decreases in prose and document literacy (-9% and -8%, respectively) and quantitative illiteracy remained unchanged with 50% of subjects scoring at less than basic literacy levels. 

The National Assessment of Adult Literacy is the most comprehensive measure of adult literacy in the USA. The 2003 NAAL, with 19 000 participants, was conducted by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEducational%20Testing%20Service"&gt;Educational Testing Service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a non-governmental organization which charges for its services. 

<h2>Understanding the results</h2>

The survey measured three types of literacy:

<dl>
BULLET::::- Prose Literacy
BULLET::::- Document Literacy
BULLET::::- Quantitative Literacy

</dl>
In each of these types of literacy the study categorized the subjects into four classes: below basic literacy, basic literacy, intermediate literacy, and proficient literacy. The break down of literacy was performed across a range of variables, such as ethnicity, gender, age, first language, education, and employment status.

<h2>Selected results</h2>

Some of the results were surprising, while others reflect continuing trends in the population.

High proficiency in reading continued to decline between 1992 and 2003 among White subjects, as well as among Hispanics&amp;mdash;both down 1%&amp;mdash;while Black subjects maintained their level and Asian/Pacific Islanders increased 3%. Across the ethnicities education level was a greater indicator of reading proficiently with 4.5% of high (secondary) school graduates reading at this level compared with 29% of college graduates and 36% of subjects in graduate studies/degrees.

An important difference between the 2003 survey and the 1992 survey was both in the make-up of the sample and in the inclusion of subjects who were unable to communicate in English or Spanish with the researchers. By ethnicity, the percentage of Black participants remained largely the same while the percentage of Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islanders grew significantly and the percentage of White participants was reduced. The instructions were made available in English and Spanish, although all testing material was exclusively in English, and 3% of participants who were unable to answer basic literacy screening questions took an alternative assessment. Even so, 2% of the subject group were unable to communicate with researchers at all in English or Spanish (this was down from 3% in 1992.)

<h2>Why are the tests carried out?</h2>
According to the National Centre for Education Statistics, the tests are carried out to measure America's progress in the area of adult literacy. The results are made available to the general public, but are of most interest to researchers, practitioners and policymakers.

&lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Jose%2C%20California"&gt;San Jose&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; – 
Del Borgsdorf, the &lt;a href="w%3Acity%20manager"&gt;city manager&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Jose%2C%20California"&gt;San Jose, California&lt;/a&gt; announced his resignation on Tuesday, citing "personal reasons" and the "political environment" for his decision. While he denies it is was a factor in his decision, the resignation comes one day after &lt;a href="w%3ASanta%20Clara%20County%2C%20California"&gt;Santa Clara County&lt;/a&gt; District Attorney George Kennedy announced his office will investigate the city's contract with Norcal Waste Systems for possible criminal prosecution. Borgsdorf has been criticized by the city council for not informing the council of the $11 million rate hike promised to the company by mayor &lt;a href="w%3ARon%20Gonzales"&gt;Ron Gonzales&lt;/a&gt;.

Borgsdorf's resignation follows the resignation of other city officials; Stephen Haase, the city's planning director, and John Bjurman, the city's director of information technology, resigned earlier in the week. In addition, the city council formally censured mayor Gonzales last week, and asked for formal apologies from Borgsdorf and city attorney Richard Doyle over the Norcal contract. In addition to the waste removal scandal, the city government has been criticized for a no-bid contract with &lt;a href="w%3ACisco%20Systems"&gt;Cisco Systems&lt;/a&gt; to provide IT equipment in the new City Hall; the Cisco deal cost city taxpayers over $3 million in equipment costs and construction delays.

Strike Force Enoggera, the group of detectives poised with investigating the recent racially motivated violence across &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;, has laid its first charges against a man alleged to have forwarded SMS messages encouraging further violence.

&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; Police allege that a 33 year-old Matraville man, who was arrested at 9:30PM Wednesday, forwarded "offensive and inciting" text messages following the violence at Cronulla. The man was taken to Maroubra Police Station where he was charged with using a carriage service to menace, harass or cause offence and a count of print, publish to incite or urge the commission of a crime. He was granted bail and is to appear in Waverley Local Court on 1 February 2006.

It is alleged that the messages were to incite people to turn out at Cronulla on December 18, 2005 for another round of violence.

Strike Force Enoggera commander Dennis Bray has indicated that more arrests will follow. He also said that arrests will not only be made for organising the events but for the "more serious criminal offences" committed during the violence.

The investigations into the violence have been extended further with the Australian Survelliance and Intelligence Organisation (&lt;a href="w%3AASIO"&gt;ASIO&lt;/a&gt;) conducting their own investigation into groups thought to have used the violence to promote their own political agenda.

A Japanese whaling ship, the Keiko Maru, will be docking in &lt;a href="w%3AHobart"&gt;Hobart&lt;/a&gt; on December 24 to transfer a sick crew member to hospital. The crew member is suffering from appendicitis.

Greenpeace has called on the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20government"&gt;Australian government&lt;/a&gt; to prevent the ship from refuelling. The government stated it is opposed to commercial whaling, but that taking such action would be "counter-productive". Greenpeace CEO Steve Shallhorn said that it is an opportunity for Australia to demonstrate its opposition. "The Australian Government does have control over port authorities and we believe it does have the possibility to refuse to allow the ship to be refuelled," he said.
Federal Environment Minister Ian Campbell supports the intention of Greenpeace activists, but believes that such a protest would not be helpful. "In some respects it can be counter-productive although I share the passion, I share their objective, we share of the objective of trying to stop whaling," he said.

Japan claims that its whaling activities in the Southern Ocean are for scientific purposes, and reject suggestions that the catch is commercial. "Anti-whaling proponents have tried to label the research catch as commercial whaling in disguise, but this is a tactic to discredit the research effort," says the Question and Answer section of the Japan Whaling Association website.

&lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AEvo%20Morales"&gt;Evo Morales&lt;/a&gt; has fallen foul of a “bad taste joke” by a Catholic radio station joker who posed as the Spanish Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AJose%20Rodriguez%20Zapatero"&gt;Jose Rodriguez Zapatero&lt;/a&gt;. The voice imitator telephoned Evo Morales to congratulate him for “♡❤joining the Cuban-Venezuelan axis♡❤” and asked him to make &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ASpain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; his first international destination as president of &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ABolivia"&gt;Bolivia&lt;/a&gt;.

The journalist involved in the hoax is said to be an anti-socialist activist very critical of &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AFidel%20Castro"&gt;Fidel Castro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AHugo%20Chavez"&gt;Hugo Chavez&lt;/a&gt; and the government of Rodriguez Zapatero.

Erick Torrico, chairman of the Area of Communication and Journalism for the Andean University Simon Bolivar has rejected the action calling it “♡❤an offense that goes beyond the person♡❤” […] “♡❤It is an insult against the people of Bolivia, a major blunder which is also an attack against the dignity of the Spanish Prime Minister♡❤” and demanded a “♡❤clear explanation from the Government of Madrid about the incident that seems aimed to undermine the credibility of the president elect♡❤”.

Raul Penaranda, chairman of the weekly magazine “Epoca” said that the joke was “♡❤wrong, unethical, ill intentioned and irresponsible♡❤”

Rodriguez Zapatero later spoke to Morales to transmit to him a genuine message of congratulations from the Spanish government and stated that the call made by the imitator was “unacceptable.”

The Spanish government backed up the formal complaint made by the Bolivian embassy in Madrid to the Director of the &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ACatholic%20Church"&gt;Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt; as they considered that the call was an "♡❤offense to the Bolivian People♡❤".

&lt;a href="w%3ASeagate%20Technology"&gt;Seagate Technology&lt;/a&gt; has said it intends to buy rival company &lt;a href="w%3AMaxtor"&gt;Maxtor&lt;/a&gt; for $1.9 billion. Both companies produce hard drives. The deal, priced at 60% of Maxtor's closing share price, is intended to acquire Maxtor's customers, not its technology.

Seagate, which also makes drives for Microsoft's Xbox 360, will have over 40% of the hard drive market share. The &lt;a href="w%3AScotts%20Valley%2C%20California"&gt;Scotts Valley, California&lt;/a&gt;, based Seagate had 30% of the hard drive market.

Provided the deal makes it past regulatory committees, Maxtor shareholders will receive .37 of a share of Seagate common stock for every 1 share of the &lt;a href="w%3AMilpitas%2C%20California"&gt;Milpitas&lt;/a&gt; based company.

An Australian woman has won the right to be impregnated with sperm from her husband, who died seven years ago. The sperm was taken from the man shortly after his death in a car accident, and frozen. The Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal ruled that the woman should be permitted to take the sperm to New South Wales. Posthumous conception is illegal in Victoria, where the sperm is currently stored.

In an article in the December 2005 issue of the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20England%20Journal%20of%20Medicine"&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ (NEJM), researchers from &lt;a href="w%3AOxford%20University"&gt;Oxford University&lt;/a&gt; report that two recent &lt;a href="w%3AAvian%20flu"&gt;avian flu&lt;/a&gt; fatalities in &lt;a href="w%3AVietnam"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt; were patients who had been treated with the anti-viral medication ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ATamiflu"&gt;Tamiflu&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. There has been one other reported case of Tamiflu-resistance in Vietnam. 

The NEJM report documents that during treatment of H5N1-infected patients with Tamiflu there can be selection for mutant virus variants that are Tamiflu-resistant. This is also been observed with other more common flu virus types. The chances of Tamiflu-resistance arising during H5N1 infections might be enhanced by two properties of H5N1; its ability to replicate rapidly and its ability to infect the gastrointestinal tract. In such cases, higher doses of Tamiflu and longer course of treatment may be needed. Combination treatment with other anti-viral drugs is a common strategy for dealing with viruses that become drug resistant.

<h1>Destroyed Kelso High School to be rebuilt</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Destroyed%20Kelso%20High%20School%20to%20be%20rebuilt&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The future direction of Kelso High School has become a little clearer following an announcement by the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; government that the school will be rebuilt on it's former site as a year 7 to 12 secondary school.

The original school built in 1978 was destroyed by fire on August 18, 2005. The cause of the fire remains a mystery. Following the fire, students were receiving lessons at a number of locations around Bathurst, but have since returned to the Kelso High School site where they are housed in demountable buildings on the school's oval. The ruins of the former school lay behind.

A report made following a series of community meetings into the replacement of the school earlier this month said that the community wished for Kelso High School to be rebuilt at its former site as a secondary school. The report also said that the community wished for Kelso and Bathurst High Schools to pool HSC resources by sharing subjects and allowing years 11 and 12 students to study across both campuses.

A number of models were proposed at the meetings. These included:
<ul>
BULLET::::- Rebuilding Kelso High School as a senior high school only (years 10 through 12) near Charles Sturt University and Bathurst TAFE. Under this plan Bathurst High School would cater for years 7 to 9.
BULLET::::- Rebuilding Kelso High School as a middle school from years 6 to 9.
BULLET::::- Rebuild Kelso High School as both a primary and secondary school, incorporating Kelso Public School.
BULLET::::- Rebuilding Kelso High School as it was on it's former site.

</ul>
The proposal to rebuild Kelso High School as a secondary school and share HSC resources with Bathurst High School was made at the community meetings. Under this system, both schools will have separate principals and identities with a college director co-ordinating HSC activities between the two campuses. If one school does not offer a subject the student is interested in they will be able to take that subject at the other campus.

&lt;a href="w%3AErowid"&gt;Erowid&lt;/a&gt;, a website with the stated mission of "Documenting the Complex Relationship Between Humans &amp; Psychoactives" has over the past few months been gathering data through a series of surveys about the drug &lt;a href="w%3ALSD"&gt;LSD&lt;/a&gt; to present at the &lt;a href="w%3ALSD"&gt;LSD&lt;/a&gt; Symposium, scheduled for January &lt;a href="w%3A2006"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ABasel"&gt;Basel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASwitzerland"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;.

The website, a popular resource of information about psychoactive plants and chemicals, recently posted its fifth &lt;a href="w%3Asurvey"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt;, querying users about their age, the number of times they've taken &lt;a href="w%3ALSD"&gt;LSD&lt;/a&gt; and how that would be affected if LSD was legal. Past surveys have been longer and more thorough, asking users about the availability of the drug, positive and negative experiences, and if they've ever experienced LSD related &lt;a href="w%3ALSD%23FlashbacksLSD"&gt;"flashbacks"&lt;/a&gt;. 

The LSD Symposium website states that it will include a panel of over sixty experts from around the world discussing a wide range of topics regarding LSD. Topics scheduled include, "The Discovery of LSD-25", "Appraisal of &lt;a href="w%3AAlbert%20Hofmann"&gt;Albert Hofmann's&lt;/a&gt; life work" and "The History of Drug Policy" and several others.

LSD is a &lt;a href="w%3Apsychedelic%20drugs"&gt;psychedelic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Adrug"&gt;drug&lt;/a&gt; known for its mind altering effects, including both visual and auditory &lt;a href="w%3Ahallucinations"&gt;hallucinations&lt;/a&gt;. LSD was first synthesized by &lt;a href="w%3AAlbert%20Hofmann"&gt;Albert Hofmann&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3A1938"&gt;1938&lt;/a&gt;. Hofmann, a Swiss chemist discovered the psychedelic effects of LSD on April 16, &lt;a href="w%3A1943"&gt;1943&lt;/a&gt; when he accidentally absorbed it in its liquid form through his finger tips. Since then, it has been made illegal in most countries as a result of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AConvention%20on%20Psychotropic%20Substances"&gt;Convention on Psychotropic Substances&lt;/a&gt; which requires all parties of the convention to &lt;a href="w%3Acriminalize"&gt;criminalize&lt;/a&gt; it in their countries.

Erowid, based in California, was created in October &lt;a href="w%3A1995"&gt;1995&lt;/a&gt;, and is hailed by many as a reliable resource for information on drug and drug culture. The website includes information on legality issues, chemical information, user submitted experiences, positive and negative effects of individual drugs and other information.

By a narrow vote late in the evening on December 21st, 2005 the &lt;a href="US%20Senate"&gt;US Senate&lt;/a&gt; blocked opening the nation's oil reserve in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AArctic%20National%20Wildlife%20Refuge"&gt;National Wildlife Refuge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;a href="Alaska"&gt;Alaska&lt;/a&gt; . This vote delivers a victory to environmentalists and denies the Bush administration their top energy priority. Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATed%20Stevens"&gt;Ted Stevens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;a href="Republican%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;-Alaska) attached the drilling plan to a measure to fund ongoing military operations in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Senate late last night agreed to pass the defense bill, without the drilling provision. 

Two key Republicans, Lincoln D Chafee (&lt;a href="Republican%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="Rhode%20Island"&gt;R.I.&lt;/a&gt;) and Mike DeWine (&lt;a href="Republican%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="Ohio"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt;), joined Democrats in opposing the drilling. Senator Lieberman (&lt;a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;D&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="Connecticut"&gt;Conn&lt;/a&gt;) said yesterday that Stevens was to blame for holding up money for the military. By including the drilling measure in the defense spending bill, it was hoped to twist the senators' arms into voting for both provisions together in the scramble to finish the important business before the Senate's Christmas break.

Protests erupted on Wednesday in &lt;a href="w%3AMeerut"&gt;Meerut&lt;/a&gt;, north-east of &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Delhi"&gt;New Delhi&lt;/a&gt;, as scenes of female cops beating and pulling the hair of young couples in a local park were telecasted on news channels.

People crowded the streets to protest against the actions which the local police termed as law enforcement.

'Operation Majnu' as it was termed was aimed at breaking up frolicking couples at Company Gardens on Monday afternoon. Chief of Police Meerut said that the police entrusted to enforce a drive against &lt;a href="w%3Aobscenity"&gt;obscenity&lt;/a&gt; had clearly gone overboard.

Two policewomen have been suspended and an internal inquiry has been ordered. The two were named as Inspector Madhu Malati and sub-inspector Mamata Gautam who were most active in the physical assault carried out on the women.

The targets of the assault were not satisfied. One of the women, aged 25, was taking a walk in the park with her brother when Inspector Madhu Malati descended on her calling her a whore and beating her up. Priyanka was kicked in the chest and slapped numerous times on her face just like dozens of other women who, after being beaten up were dragged to vehicles waiting to take them to the police station where their parents were called. They were later released after warnings.

Students spilled onto the streets of Meerut shouting "Down with Police Dictatorship" and set fire to effigies of cops.

After the public humilation of being beaten up, abused and dragged to the police station to make statements, several couples did not make their way back home and are still reported to be missing.

Members of Parliament said this was the sign of a sick mind. News reports have quoted the Meerut Police range DIG as admitting to extreme and excessive treament by the police in Operation Majnu carried out in the company gardens on Monday.

One angry student protester said that this is a sign of hypocrisy and that India cannot be the country with the second largest population in the world if people sitting together in this country is such a sin.

<h1>Australian academic study supports nuclear power</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Australian%20academic%20study%20supports%20nuclear%20power&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A group of Melbourne scientists has released a study of the energy problems confronting Australia in the future. The study endorses the use of nuclear energy and attacks some of the data used by anti-nuclear campaigners. 

The scientists from the University of Melbourne say their research shows that the benefits of nuclear energy have been underestimated and concerns about nuclear waste overplayed. 

The six month study compared the environmental impact, health risks, economic effects and social implications of the use of fossil fuels, renewable energy sources such as wind and solar energy, and nuclear power.

According to the Melbourne University, the investigation will significantly impact the nuclear debate in Australia, with findings showing that hundreds of times more uranium could be available than was predicted in a widely quoted European study. 

Associate Professor Martin Sevior, of Melbourne University's school of physics, claims the recent study bolsters the case for Australia to invest more in nuclear energy. Sevior says his research into nuclear waste disposal should help dispel many environmentalists' fears.

"One thing that's perhaps not always realised is that the amount of waste that comes out of a typical plant is around 30 tonnes a year, he said. "The amount of waste that comes out of a coal-fired power plant is around 1,000 tonnes a day." 

Prof Sevior says his study has exposed flaws in the European study into the limits of the uranium industry. "This previous research overestimated the energy costs and carbon emissions generated by the construction of nuclear power plants and for mining uranium," Prof Sevior said.

The Australian Conservation Foundation's (ACF) nuclear campaigner, Dave Sweeney, says the study appears flawed and does not provide a sound argument for the use of nuclear energy.

"It glances over some really key concerns of proliferation, key areas of reactor safety are not delved into too deeply and they have direct links to industry websites for further information," said Mr Sweeney. "I'm not sure it's altogether appropriate or altogether balanced to be referring people to the nuclear industry's own websites for further information on such matters as radioactive waste, nuclear weapons and nuclear reactor safety." 

The six-month study found Australia has more uranium than was previously thought. "We have enough uranium in Australia to power the country for thousands of years," said Prof Sevior.

Friends of the Earth nuclear campaigner Dr Jim Green said nuclear power should never be considered as an energy source. He said greenhouse emissions saved by switching to nuclear power were only about 5 per cent of total emissions and could only be achieved if thousands of reactors were installed globally. 

Dr Green said an energy debate in Australia was necessary, but it had to go beyond just the nuclear alternative.

With first world countries such as &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; reluctant to engage in trials of a vaccine for &lt;a href="w%3AHIV"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt; has completed recruitment of volunteers for Phase III of a &lt;a href="w%3AClinical%20trial"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt;. Over sixteen thousand selected volunteers from a pool of 65,000 will receive the experimental vaccine combination, ALVAC and AIDS Vac.

The trial is concentrated in the provinces of &lt;a href="w%3AChon%20Buri%20Province"&gt;Chon Buri&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARayong%20Province"&gt;Rayong&lt;/a&gt; and will be monitored over a period of three years to assess the effectiveness of the experimental vaccination.

In Canada questions were raised regarding the safety of conducting wide-scale trials of a vaccine. It was strongly suspected that participants in a trial might be encouraged to engage in unsafe behaviour when, due to the &lt;a href="w%3ADouble-blind"&gt;double-blind&lt;/a&gt; nature of the clinical trial, they may have received a placebo in place of the vaccine.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Union%20of%20Rail%2C%20Maritime%20and%20Transport%20Workers"&gt;National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers&lt;/a&gt; (RMT) has called for industrial action on New Year's Eve over staffing levels on the &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Underground"&gt;London Underground&lt;/a&gt;. Union members voted more than five to one in favour of the strike.

The vote for industrial action is because of "back-door attempts to displace hundreds of safety-critical station staff under spurious cover," said &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Crow"&gt;Bob Crow&lt;/a&gt;, RMT General Secretary, to the BBC. "The RMT will not accept any dilution of safety standards either for our members, or Tube users and we hope that the travelling public will join us in calling on London Underground to step back from the brink and start talking to us seriously."

Following the vote, the RMT called for a 24-hour strike beginning at noon on New Year's Eve, and if necessary a second 24-hour action to begin 6:30 p.m. Sunday, 8 January. &lt;a href="w%3ATransport%20for%20London"&gt;Transport for London&lt;/a&gt; announced a meeting with the 
RMT at ACAS(The Advisory, Conciliation, and Arbitration Service) after the results of the vote were announced.

The London Underground responded to the move, pointing to the agreement made last year with the RMT which agreed to shorter working weeks so long as there is no additional cost to Tube fare payers. "There are no staff cuts across the Tube network," the spokesperson said.

"There can be no justification for the RMT now reneging on its agreement and trying to ruin New Year's Eve for thousands of Londoners," &lt;a href="w%3AMayor%20of%20London"&gt;London Mayor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AKen%20Livingstone"&gt;Ken Livingstone&lt;/a&gt; said.
