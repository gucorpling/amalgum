<h1>SBC teams with Scientific-Atlanta for cable TV rollout in 13 US states</h1>

Regional U.S. telephone giant &lt;a href="w%3ASBC%20Communications"&gt;SBC Communications&lt;/a&gt; is one step closer to offering cable television to the 18 million households in its 13 state coverage area. The company announced a $195 million contract with &lt;a href="w%3AScientific-Atlanta"&gt;Scientific-Atlanta&lt;/a&gt; Thursday to provide a video operations center and regional hubs for the new service. Under the &lt;a href="w%3Abrand"&gt;brand&lt;/a&gt; name, U-verse, the SBC's television rollout is set to launch in 2006 after field trials begin later this year.

The company is seeking the so-called "triple play," where a telecommunications company offers voice, data and video in one bundled package. Local telephone companies like SBC have been losing business to cable TV companies, which have added telephone and Internet services in recent years.

In a slew of recent deals, SBC is looking to stop that trend. Within the past six months it has signed alliances with various technology firms to build out a fiber network to the home strategy. For instance, SBC has a $1.7 billion deal with &lt;a href="w%3AAlcatel"&gt;Alcatel&lt;/a&gt; to build out its &lt;a href="w%3Afiber%20optic"&gt;fiber optic&lt;/a&gt; network and a 10-year, $400 million, pact with Microsoft to license its &lt;a href="w%3AIPTV"&gt;IPTV&lt;/a&gt; technology to allow multi-channel television to stream over its Internet backbone.

In most of the U.S. only cable TV companies like &lt;a href="w%3AComcast"&gt;Comcast&lt;/a&gt; have been able to offer the "triple play" of voice, video and data services. But traditional phone companies like SBC and &lt;a href="w%3AVerizon"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt; have been upgrading their copper wire telephone networks to fiber optic. SBC says it plans to spend billions of dollars to overhaul its telecommunications network, saying the aging and brittle copper wires which were originally laid in the early 1900s do not have enough &lt;a href="w%3Abandwidth"&gt;bandwidth&lt;/a&gt; to allow television capability.

♡❤Space.com♡❤ reported yesterday on a picture of a planet taken by the &lt;a href="w%3AVery%20Large%20Telescope"&gt;Very Large Telescope&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href="w%3AChile"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Southern%20Observatory"&gt;European Southern Observatory's&lt;/a&gt; telescope, which was used to capture the picture, has made the first confirmed discovery of a planet orbiting another star.

Scientists have been trying to locate planets outside our own solar system for nearly 10 years. Inferences of nearly 150 planets in other solar systems have been observed so far by using instruments and measurements that only suggest the existence of another planet. Until now, no planet has been confirmed by the means of a photographed image. There was, months earlier, another team of scientists who took pictures of what might be another planet, but that image remains controversial because it shows what may be an even more distant object instead.

The research team that photographed the planet with its host star was led by Ralph Neuhaeuser of the Astrophysical Institute &amp; University Observatory (AIU). "The detection of the faint object near the bright star is certain," he told ♡❤Space.com♡❤ on Friday.

The new image contains the star, GQ Lupi, with an orbiting planet. It is smaller than our &lt;a href="w%3ASun"&gt;sun&lt;/a&gt;, 70% the size, and is located 400 &lt;a href="w%3Alight-years"&gt;light-years&lt;/a&gt; away from our solar system. The planet is nearly twice the size of &lt;a href="w%3AJupiter%20%28planet%29"&gt;Jupiter&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike our sun which is 4.6 billion years old, the GQ Lupi star is approximately 1 million years old and is considered very young for a star. The planet orbiting GQ Lupi is three times further out than &lt;a href="w%3ANeptune%20%28planet%29"&gt;Neptune's&lt;/a&gt; orbit around our sun, and scientists estimate the orbiting period to be about 1,200 years. The planets wide orbiting distance from the GQ Lupi was an important element for enabling the photograph to be taken.

The planet, much like the star it orbits, is very hot &amp;mdash; about 2,000 degrees Kelvin &amp;mdash; so despite the detection of water in the planet's atmosphere, which at that temperature would make it gaseous, there is no expectation it might support life.

The discovery will be detailed in an upcoming issue of the journal ♡❤Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics♡❤.

At 9.30 am today the Vatican released a statement to give the latest news of the health of the Pope.

In the statement, the condition of the Pope at 7am UTC this morning was described as being "substantially unchanged and therefore very serious". At dawn, he was said to have entered a "compromised state of consciousness".

Last night, the Pope was heard to say several times 'I have looked for you. Now you have come to me. And I thank you.' The statement was an apparent reference to all the young people he met during his pontificate.

Although the Pope is reported to have spoken, many people are unconvinced, following his inability to speak during Easter mass.

In a press conference held this morning, the official Papal spokesperson, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, is reported by ♡❤BBC News♡❤ as saying "Sometimes it seems as if he were resting with his eyes closed, but when you speak to him, he opens his eyes."

A professor from &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia%27s"&gt;Australia's&lt;/a&gt; most prestigious university said yesterday that Australian Treasurer, &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Costello"&gt;Peter Costello&lt;/a&gt;, "must try harder on welfare." Professor Bob Gregory of the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20National%20University"&gt;Australian National University&lt;/a&gt; and leading economist said, "If people could not hide on disability and sole parent pensions then [Mr Costello] couldn't claim credit for the fall in unemployment."

"In my view, the Treasurer has to come out openly and say that he has not been able to produce full-time jobs at a sufficient rate to get people off welfare. Either he has to wait until the economy generates unskilled jobs or he has to play around with the wage system."

Another report relating to the Australian Social Security system was released yesterday by researchers at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Melbourne"&gt;University of Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;. It found that care-givers who look after mentally ill dependents claim significantly less stress when they engaged in work outside the home.

A &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Australian%20Navy"&gt;Royal Australian Navy (RAN)&lt;/a&gt; helicopter, helping victims of last week's earthquake in &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;, crashed Saturday night, killing nine &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australians&lt;/a&gt; onboard,and injuring two. The &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Australian Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt;, described the event as 'heart breaking' and said the crash of the &lt;a href="w%3AWestland%20Sea%20King"&gt;Sea King&lt;/a&gt; helicopter appeared to be an accident.

The 30-year old helicopter crashed on approach to Amandraya village on the remote west coast of &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesia's&lt;/a&gt; island of &lt;a href="w%3ANias"&gt;Nias&lt;/a&gt;, ferrying an emergency medical team from the &lt;a href="w%3AHMAS%20Kanimbla"&gt;HMAS Kanimbla&lt;/a&gt; to the village. They were part of a relief effort following the devastating earthquake on Monday.

Six from the Navy and three from the &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Australian%20Air%20Force"&gt;Air Force&lt;/a&gt;, died, confirmed &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Defence%20Force"&gt;Defence Force&lt;/a&gt; Chief, &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Cosgrove"&gt;Lieutenant General Peter Cosgrove&lt;/a&gt;.

The dead were seven men and two women, including four air crew, with the remainder were members of the medical relief team intending to commence operations on the ground.

The two injured survivors were airlifted to Kanimbla for emergency surgery by a second helicopter from the ship that landed with a medical team after seeing smoke from the crash site.

"The helicopters had been working for a while in inserting, on the southern end of (Nias) island, medical teams which indeed evacuated some of the Indonesian people back to the ship for treatment. This was another one of those sorts of tasks," said the Defence Force Chief.

"After losing contact with that aircraft, a second Sea King from the Kanimbla, in the general area, came upon the aircraft on the ground, on a soccer field, on fire. Events unfolded from there. We know that the helicopter was flying at low height at about the time when the crash occurred. But we don't know (what went wrong)."

The Kanimbla immediately scrambled its second helicopter to inspect the crash zone for a second time after Indonesian military authorities in the area suggested the other nine passengers on board may have survived. An hour later the ship's crew members were informed that all nine had been killed and their bodies were discovered in the wreckage by a team of paramedics and rescue personnel.

Airworthiness investigators would immediately begin an investigation to find out the cause of the incident. Inquiries would include a coronial inquiry to be conducted in Australia.

The names of the dead have been released:

Shortly before parliamentary elections were held in &lt;a href="w%3AKyrgyzstan"&gt;Kyrgyzstan&lt;/a&gt;, an opposition-run newspaper ran photographs of a palace under construction for since-deposed president Askar Akayev. This newspaper received grants from and was printed on a printing press financed by the &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Government%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;US government&lt;/a&gt;.

The US government itself confirms this. In fact, nearly one year ago in May 2004, &lt;a href="w%3ALorne%20Craner"&gt;Lorne Craner&lt;/a&gt;, US Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor revealed:
♡❤We did a project recently... in Kyrgyzstan where there had only ever been one printing press. We funded the operation of another printing press there so that newspapers that were once unable to print day by day -- due to censorship and lacks of facilities -- are now able to print much more often, basically every day now.♡❤

Kyrgyzstan became the nation with the highest per-capita foreign assistance level in central Asia after the collapse of the &lt;a href="w%3ASoviet%20Union"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the money came from the US, under the FREEDOM Support Act, passed in 1992 to help former Soviet republics in transition. Money ear-marked for Kyrgyz pro-democracy programs totaled about $13.3 million dollars last year.

According to a &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20State%20Department"&gt;US State Department&lt;/a&gt; statement, the programs receiving the money "focus on improving political processes and accountability of government institutions, strengthening civil society and public advocacy, and supporting independent media."

Akayev, in an interview with RIA Novosti, said that the opposition which had taken over the government in Kyrgyzstan was supported "with financial and technical support from the USA."

As proof, he cited a report which was posted on the Internet and attributed to the US ambassador in Kyrgyzstan. "The scenario was carried out to a tee. In it he writes that president Akayev has to be toppled, removed. And because the country is key, a neighbor of &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, with a &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n [military] base, it's necessary to increase influence there."

♡❤The New York Times♡❤ described this report as "crudely forged" and Kyrgyzstan's new leaders have pledged to keep both the US and Russian military bases in the country and maintain friendly diplomatic relations with Russia.

On the first anniversary of Gmail's release, Google has announced that it will increase the amount of storage available for the users of the web-based email service from 1 &lt;a href="w%3Agigabyte"&gt;GB&lt;/a&gt; to over 2 GB. Additionally, they have added formatting rich-text features to Gmail. According to a page at the Gmail Help Center, while not all accounts currently have the formatting features added, "over the next several weeks, we are introducing rich formatting to all of our users."

The increase in storage is announced on the main Gmail page with a &lt;a href="w%3AJavaScript"&gt;JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; counter that increases the quoted available storage in relation to the current date. For example, on April 1 at 5 a.m. UTC the site announced 1025 &lt;a href="w%3Amegabyte"&gt;MB&lt;/a&gt; available, 30 hours later &amp;mdash; 2050 MB, and a week later it should announce a total of 2075 MB. 

Unless Google adjusts the code behind the counter, the text will read "Over 2075" after April 9.

An insurgency involving approximately 40 to 60 fighters at &lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Ghraib"&gt;Abu Ghraib&lt;/a&gt; prison base was repelled by the &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraqi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; armies on Saturday, according to Lieutenant Colonel Guy Rudisill in a conversation with ♡❤Reuters♡❤.

The conflict, described as intermittent and lasting an hour, involved two car bombs, rocket propelled grenades and small arms fire. Officials in &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt; reported approximately 20 U.S. service members and 12 prison detainees were wounded. According to the Colonel the attack occurred at 10 a.m. EST.

US forces responded with heavy weapons fire and eventually brought the situation under control. There are no reports how many insurgents were wounded or killed in the battle.

&lt;a href="w%3AChicago"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt; city inspectors closed the landmark Lithuanian restaurant Healthy Food on Thursday, after finding mouse feces on the meat slicer and cutting board, and a dead mouse in the cooler.

The restaurant has operated at 3236 S. Halsted, on the south side of the city in the Bridgeport neighborhood, since the 1930s.

&lt;a href="Main%20Page"&gt;♡❤Wikinews♡❤&lt;/a&gt; reporter placed a call to the restaurant to inquire if they were open. The call was answered by a woman who said, "No, we're closed. There's some technical difficulties. I'm sorry. Thank you for calling." A second phone could be heard ringing in the background.

Streets and Sanitation spokesman Matt Smith told the ♡❤Chicago Sun-Times♡❤, "To reopen, they're going to have to present us with a revamped game plan for not only rodent control but also housekeeping, they'll have to make all the corrections that our inspectors point out," he continued, "and pass a very stringent follow-up inspection."

Patrons have praised the restaurant's sauerkraut soup and other dishes over the years. Before it was closed, the restaurant had a lot of traffic from the nearby Cook County Circuit Court. The restaurant was once voted "Best Ethnic Eastern European Restaurant in Chicago", according to ♡❤New City♡❤.

Volunteers from across the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and some foreign countries gathered Friday to start an unofficial border patrol project.

They converged on the town of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATombstone%2C%20Arizona"&gt;Tombstone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Arizona"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt; to take part in what organizers call the Minuteman Project. 

Many came with personal firearms, cell phones or walking canes.

Most estimates numbered the group at 400 to 450 people, recruited from the Internet, far less than the 1,300 the organizers had hoped for, but “it was enough to send a message,” according to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;Rep&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Tancredo"&gt;Tom Tancredo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Republican%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AColorodo"&gt;Colo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

"The federal government has walked away from this border," he told some volunteers. He gained support and popularity for his stance against illegal immigration, but was characterized as anti-immigration in general.

"We are here to exercise what is a basic American right: free speech and the right to assemble," he said.

Local citizens such as Luis Martinez, a third-generation Tombstone-area resident, were very unhappy with the developments. "They've come here to cause problems -- to fight. Not to solve problems.

"I work in a ranch and all the ranchers use labor from the other side" of the border.

As Martinez fought back tears, he said he wanted to see the throngs leave Tombstone and go home.

During speeches delivered at orientation meetings, Rep. Tancredo was applauded loudly as he dismissed criticism from those who have called the volunteers racists and &lt;a href="wikt%3Axenophobes"&gt;xenophobes&lt;/a&gt;.

Bush|George Bush]]&lt;/span&gt; , described the group as "vigilantes." Mexican President [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:Vicente Fox|Vicente Fox]]&lt;/span&gt; used the term ♡❤cazamigrantes♡❤ &amp;mdash; immigrant hunters.

Tancredo said: "We are saying to our government, 'Please enforce the law,' That is not a radical idea. That is not a vigilante idea. It is an American concept: the rule of law."

Many of the volunteers, some from as far away as Italy, are bedding down in the nearby Miracle Valley Bible College for about $5 a night. Others are camping on the grounds of the run-down campus, about two miles north of the border.

Opposing sides were on the streets in Tombstone, although it appeared there was little contact or friction. Local, state and federal officers had mobilized in case confrontations arose.

James Gilchrist, a former Marine and a retired accountant from Aliso Viejo, Arizona, who ran the sign-up effort, said he expected more than 1,000 volunteers to help highlight the 30-day effort. The project's goal is to patrol 23 miles of the [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:San Pedro Valley|San Pedro Valley]]&lt;/span&gt; , watch the border, and report illegal activity to law enforcement officials. 

Many people fear that the project could result in vigilante violence. Organizers hope it causes the U.S. government to increase border patrols.

Tombstone is best known as the site of the 1881 [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:Gunfight at the O.K. Corral|shootout at the OK Corral]]&lt;/span&gt; .

3, the &lt;a href="w%3A3G"&gt;3G&lt;/a&gt; mobile phone firm owned by &lt;a href="w%3AHong%20Kong"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt; based &lt;a href="w%3AHutchison%20Whampoa"&gt;Hutchison Whampoa&lt;/a&gt; has reported pre-tax, pre-exceptional losses of HK$37.5bn (US$4.8bn/€3.7bn) for 2004. This compares with losses of HK$19.6bn (US$2.5/€1.94bn) in 2003 when the company was only in operation for seven months.

Despite the losses, Hutchison Whampoa chairman Li Ka-Shing said "3 achieved substantial business momentum in 2004". The firm now has over eight million customers worldwide, with three million of these in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;.

3 was the first 3G provider in the UK, ahead of incumbent &lt;a href="w%3AVodafone"&gt;Vodafone&lt;/a&gt; by launching in 2003. Vodafone currently has about 200,000 customers for its 3G service in Britain.

&lt;a href="w%3APalestinian%20Authority"&gt;Palestinian Authority&lt;/a&gt; chairman &lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud%20Abbas"&gt;Mahmoud Abbas&lt;/a&gt; has ordered hundreds of Palestinian security officers to retire as part of a plan to reform his forces and end continuing lawlessness, a Palestinian official told ♡❤Reuters♡❤.

The official said that Abbas has ordered the ratification of a law which would effectively force hundreds of security officers from Fatah's older guard to retire early. The &lt;a href="w%3AFatah"&gt;Fatah&lt;/a&gt; faction is widely seen as corrupt, and Abbas has promised to fight this corruption.

"Hundreds of security men will retire," the official told ♡❤Reuters♡❤. He also said that the law would take effect next week.

This comes just days after Tawfik Tirawi, head of Palestinian Intelligence in the West Bank, resigned, and Abbas had several security chiefs fired for failing to curb lawlessness in the &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Bank"&gt;West Bank&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGaza"&gt;Gaza&lt;/a&gt;.

Haj Ismail, head of Palestinian national security in the West Bank, who resigned Friday after Abbas called for his resignation, blamed the government for not stopping violence and lawlessness in Gaza and the West Bank in recent months. Tirawi also said that heads of other security organizations were not doing enough to halt the lawlessness when he retired.

The time has come for &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20America"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt;ns to enjoy the extra length of the &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Hemisphere"&gt;Northern Hemisphere&lt;/a&gt;’s spring and summer day, by observing (DST).

In most areas of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AMexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, DST observers should turn their clocks ♡❤ahead♡❤ one hour at 2 a.m. Sunday morning.

In Canada, the change takes effect in &lt;a href="w%3ANewfoundland"&gt;Newfoundland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Brunswick"&gt;New Brunswick&lt;/a&gt; at 12:01 a.m., and 2 a.m. in most of the rest of the country.

&lt;a href="w%3AArizona"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHawaii"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;, the part of &lt;a href="w%3AIndiana"&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20time%20zone"&gt;Eastern time zone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APuerto%20Rico"&gt;Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AVirgin%20Islands"&gt;Virgin Islands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Samoa"&gt;American Samoa&lt;/a&gt; do not change their clocks. Certain areas in Canada also do not observe DST, such as &lt;a href="w%3ASaskatchewan"&gt;Saskatchewan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20province"&gt;province&lt;/a&gt;. Mexico only started observing DST in &lt;a href="w%3A1996"&gt;1996&lt;/a&gt;, after the &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20American%20Free%20Trade%20Agreement"&gt;North American Free Trade Agreement&lt;/a&gt;, to coordinate their times with neighbouring states.

North America isn't the only region observing DST. Many &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20countries"&gt;European countries&lt;/a&gt; began last week and several countries south of the &lt;a href="w%3Aequator"&gt;equator&lt;/a&gt; returned to &lt;a href="w%3Astandard%20time"&gt;standard time&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AMarch"&gt;March&lt;/a&gt; as they enter autumn. Other countries continue to discuss whether or not a switch to the system is a good idea. In &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3AKnesset"&gt;Knesset&lt;/a&gt; committee recently decided to begin observing daylight savings on the last Thursday before April 1.

In North America, daylight savings time ends the last &lt;a href="w%3ASunday"&gt;Sunday&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AOctober"&gt;October&lt;/a&gt;.

Safety advocates say this is a good time to change &lt;a href="w%3Aelectric%20battery"&gt;batteries&lt;/a&gt; in your &lt;a href="w%3Asmoke%20detector"&gt;smoke detector&lt;/a&gt; as well.

Despite controversy ignited by the nomination of &lt;a href="Paul%20Wolfowitz"&gt;Paul Wolfowitz&lt;/a&gt; to head the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Bank"&gt;World Bank&lt;/a&gt; (WB), the 24-member board of directors voted unanimously on Thursday to accept his confirmation. A whirlwind tour by Wolfowitz, who traveled to many capital cities of the bank’s major shareholders and met with voting board members, quieted misgivings over his succession to the incumbent president &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Wolfensohn"&gt;John Wolfensohn&lt;/a&gt;.

Widespread criticism of the Wolfowitz role in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; build-up to war in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; heightened levels of security concerns within the bank as they anticipate his arrival. The WB, from the executive level down to memos circulated among departments, express concern for it becoming the target of terrorist attack. The level of seriousness being taken by WB led it to set up cost estimates for improving security.

Wolfowitz will assume leadership in June this year. Despite a belief by some that he acts unilaterally and lacks development experience, a &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Commission"&gt;European Commission&lt;/a&gt; spokeswoman, speaking for Commissioner &lt;a href="w%3ARehn"&gt;Olli Rehn&lt;/a&gt;, told a news conference that[Rehn] "was satisfied with everything he heard from Mr Wolfowitz concerning free trade and also on poverty reduction and development policy."

The ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ quotes the &lt;a href="w%3ABelgium"&gt;Belgian&lt;/a&gt; Development Aid minister saying, "There are no objections of EU countries."

The public display of support belies dissention underneath. ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3Areuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reportedly received a confidential email that provided details of a comment line on an internal website for the WB staff who use it from their far flung locations. The feelings about the Wolfowitz nomination received 1,300 responses, mostly about the bank’s reputation and effectiveness under the new leadership.

With the death of Roman Catholic pontiff &lt;a href="John%20Paul%20II"&gt;John Paul II&lt;/a&gt;, 84, on Friday, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARoman%20Catholic%20Church"&gt;Church&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; prepares for the conclave, or assembly of cardinals, who will choose the next pope. All &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acardinal%20%28Catholicism%29"&gt;cardinals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; under the age of 80 are required to attend and cast their votes at the election, which must be held from 15-20 days following the funeral of the deceased Pontiff.

The papacy, the highest office in the Catholic church, lies vacant until the election of a new leader for the over one billion-strong denomination.

117 cardinals will meet in the Vatican's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASistine%20Chapel"&gt;Sistine Chapel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to conduct the election, beginning on April 18, it was announced today.

This conclave will be the first time in history the cardinals will be allowed to move around the &lt;a href="Vatican"&gt;Vatican&lt;/a&gt; instead of being isolated in the Sistine Chapel during the elections. However, they are not allowed to receive or send any messages outside Vatican city during the election period. Those who do so will face excommunication.

This will also be the first time that after a full week of voting, two votes each morning, two each afternoon, the required 2/3+1 support can be set aside and a new pope elected by 50%+1 of the cardinals.

At the last conclave, John Paul II was elected after four days.

Thus, the new pope is expected to be known sometime between April 18 and April 25.

With six weeks before the sixth and final ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AStar%20Wars"&gt;Star Wars&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ film saga, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ARevenge%20of%20the%20Sith"&gt;Revenge of the Sith&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, hits theaters worldwide on May 19, the movie studios behind the brand have launched a massive marketing and merchandising campaign. It includes toys aimed at children, collectibles for adults active in fandom and other related merchandise such as science fiction novels based in the Star Wars universe.

The &lt;a href="w%3A20th%20Century%20Fox"&gt;20th Century Fox&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALucasfilm"&gt;Lucasfilm&lt;/a&gt; studios make millions of dollars in licensing fees from toy manufacturers and promotional deals with fast-food restaurants, candy and cereal boxes. Even telephone companies are getting into the act. &lt;a href="w%3ACingular%20Wireless"&gt;Cingular Wireless&lt;/a&gt; will be rolling out a ♡❤Star Wars♡❤-themed promotion and handset downloads within the next few days, according to a company spokesman.

Sales from ♡❤Star Wars♡❤ tie-in merchandise have brought in a lot of money over the years. ♡❤Star Wars♡❤ toy sales themed with ♡❤The Phantom Menace♡❤ brought in $500 million. In 2002, ♡❤Attack of the Clones♡❤ toy sales were $225 million, according to reports.

In January 2003, toymaker &lt;a href="w%3AHasbro"&gt;Hasbro&lt;/a&gt; struck the biggest licensing deal for the brand when it agreed to pay Lucasfilm $200 million in cash and stock for the exclusive rights to make ♡❤Star Wars♡❤-themed toys until 2018. That figure does not include Lucasfilm's percentage of the profit from each toy's sale.

&lt;a href="w%3AWal-mart"&gt;Wal-mart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATarget%20Corporation"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, the two largest toy retailers in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; have entire aisles devoted to tie-in ♡❤Star Wars♡❤ &lt;a href="w%3Aaction%20figures"&gt;action figures&lt;/a&gt;, full-sized mock ups of &lt;a href="w%3Alight%20saber"&gt;light sabers&lt;/a&gt; and other more whimsical items. Hasbro is even marketing a "Darth Tater" special edition of its classic &lt;a href="w%3AMr.%20Potato%20Head"&gt;Mr. Potato Head&lt;/a&gt;.

The merchandise also has a literary side. Author &lt;a href="w%3AMatthew%20Stover"&gt;Matthew Stover&lt;/a&gt; has a monetization of ♡❤Revenge of the Sith♡❤ as part of a multi-book deal between Lucasfilm and publisher &lt;a href="w%3ARandom%20House"&gt;Random House's&lt;/a&gt; science fiction specialty label, &lt;a href="w%3ADel%20Rey"&gt;Del Rey&lt;/a&gt;. Stover's book has consistently been in the Top 50-most ordered books, according to Amazon.com. Other ♡❤Sith♡❤-themed books released within the past few weeks include coffee table picture books and behind-the-scenes documentation detailing the making of the film.

<h1>Speculation abounds on future pope</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Speculation%20abounds%20on%20future%20pope&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Speculation is mounting in &lt;a href="w%3ARome"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Vatican"&gt;Vatican&lt;/a&gt; observers suggesting that many factors will go into the decision of who will be &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Paul%20II"&gt;John Paul II's&lt;/a&gt; successor.

It has long been considered extremely unlikely that the next pope will be an &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20America"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AFrancis%20Cardinal%20George"&gt;Cardinal Francis George&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AChicago"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt; declared in 2003 that "to some extent, even the appearance of being in some sense captured by, as we say now, the world's only superpower, would not be helpful to the mission of the church." Some say the choice of a &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; Pope would also be overly controversial.

The &lt;a href="w%3APoland"&gt;Polish-born&lt;/a&gt; Karol Wojtyla was the first non-Italian pope in 455 years. Though in Catholic tradition, the pope bears the title of Primate of Italy and Archbishop of the Roman Province, or for short, "Bishop of Rome," this does not necessarily mean that he must be &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt;, or Roman, as was demonstrated with the election of John Paul. Nonetheless, the rise of a non-Italian pope in 1978 may be followed by a desire to reclaim the chair by Italians.

Italy will be the country with the greatest representation on the conclave, with 20 eligible cardinals. The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; trails far behind at 11, and behind them are &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; (6), France (5), and &lt;a href="Brazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; (4). 

Europe forms the largest bloc with 58 papal electors, while Latin America and Africa have 21 and 11 respectively.

John Paul II was a relatively unknown archbishop at the time of his election, indicating that it is not impossible for church leaders not well known throughout the church across the world to be potential recipients of the office.

Many analysts suggest the strong possibility that the cardinals will seek to avoid electing a young pope in the wake of John Paul's 27-year reign. Age has been a factor in the choice of pontiff during the church's history, and may surface again. The ♡❤New York Times♡❤ speculates that cardinals may choose a slightly older pope "in order to avoid another long reign," like that of John Paul II. Two well-liked figures, &lt;a href="w%3AAngelo%20Scola"&gt;Angelo Scola&lt;/a&gt; of Venice, 63, and &lt;a href="w%3AChristoph%20Sch%C3%B6nborn%20of%20Austria"&gt;Christoph Schönborn of Austria&lt;/a&gt;, 60, may well be too young to be chosen for the office. Moreover, some feel that an older pope may be selected specifically to serve as a "transitional" figure following the previous lengthy papacy.

Among the most prominent '&lt;a href="w%3Apapabile"&gt;papabili&lt;/a&gt;,' or likely potentials for the papacy are:
<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="w%3ADionigi%20Tettamanzi"&gt;Dionigi Tettamanzi&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AMilan"&gt;Milan&lt;/a&gt;, 70
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="w%3AAngelo%20Scola"&gt;Angelo Scola&lt;/a&gt;, patriarch of &lt;a href="w%3AVenice"&gt;Venice&lt;/a&gt;, 63
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="w%3AJosef%20Ratzinger"&gt;Josef Ratzinger&lt;/a&gt;, prefect of the &lt;a href="w%3ACuria"&gt;Curia&lt;/a&gt;, formerly of &lt;a href="w%3AMunich"&gt;Munich&lt;/a&gt;, 77
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9%20Maria%20Bergoglio"&gt;José Maria Bergoglio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJesuit"&gt;Jesuit&lt;/a&gt; archbishop of &lt;a href="w%3ABuenos%20Aires"&gt;Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt;, 68
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="w%3AIvan%20Dias"&gt;Ivan Dias&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMumbai"&gt;Mumbai (Bombay)&lt;/a&gt;, 68
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="w%3ARodriguez%20Maradiaga"&gt;Rodriguez Maradiaga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATegucigalpa"&gt;Tegucigalpa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHonduras"&gt;Honduras&lt;/a&gt;, 62
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="w%3AClaudio%20Hummes"&gt;Claudio Hummes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AS%C3%A3o%20Paulo"&gt;São Paulo&lt;/a&gt;, 70
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="w%3AFrancis%20Arinze"&gt;Francis Arinze&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;, 72

</ul>
Others include &lt;a href="w%3AGiovanni%20Battista%20Re"&gt;Giovanni Battista Re&lt;/a&gt;, 71, president of the Vatican commission for Latin America, and Belgian Cardinal &lt;a href="w%3AGodfried%20Danneels"&gt;Godfried Danneels&lt;/a&gt;, 71.

Analysts suggest that among the important issues around which the election of the next pontiff will center are candidates' position on socialism and capitalism, other religions or ecumenism, abortion, homosexuality, clerical celibacy, as well as their degree of progressivism or conservatism and relations with the international community.

&lt;a href="w%3AFA%20Premier%20League"&gt;Barclaycard Premiership&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Afootball%20%28soccer%29"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; match between &lt;a href="w%3ANewcastle%20United%20F.C."&gt;Newcastle United&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAston%20Villa%20F.C."&gt;Aston Villa&lt;/a&gt; ended up with a fight between two teammates. Newcastle hasn't lost a single game since January 23 and looked as favourites for their April 2 home match against Aston Villa. However things haven't went as planned. On the 5th minute of the game &lt;a href="w%3AJuan%20Pablo%20Angel"&gt;Juan Pablo Angel&lt;/a&gt; scored for the away side. Villa continued to dominate and in the second half any hopes of fightback for Newcastle were shattered as &lt;a href="w%3ASteven%20Taylor"&gt;Steven Taylor&lt;/a&gt; got sent off for the deliberate handball. The foul warranted a penalty and &lt;a href="w%3AGareth%20Barry"&gt;Gareth Barry&lt;/a&gt; scored from the spot. Seven minutes later he did it again, after &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Carr"&gt;Stephen Carr&lt;/a&gt; brought down &lt;a href="w%3ADarius%20Vassell"&gt;Darius Vassell&lt;/a&gt; inside the box.

However, it was not a result that disappointed Toon fans the most. Two Newcastle players, &lt;a href="w%3ALee%20Bowyer"&gt;Lee Bowyer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AKieron%20Dyer"&gt;Kieron Dyer&lt;/a&gt;, engaged in a fight in the middle of the pitch at the sight of the crowd. Referee Barry Knight made a decision to &lt;a href="w%3Ared%20card"&gt;send both off&lt;/a&gt;. After the match, manager &lt;a href="w%3AGraeme%20Souness"&gt;Graeme Souness&lt;/a&gt; made no excuse for the behavior of the players; however he defended Dyer, as it was Bowyer who started punching him. Both players could be facing 3-match bans by the English &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Football%20Association"&gt;Football Association&lt;/a&gt;.

The names of nine &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n service personnel who died Saturday in a helicopter crash near the village of Aman Dray on the &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;n island of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANias"&gt;Nias&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have been released by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Defence%20Force"&gt;Australian Defence Force&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (ADF). The tragedy is the worst naval flying accident in Australian history.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Australian%20Navy"&gt;Royal Australian Navy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; lost Lieutenant Mathew Davy and Lieutenant Paul Kimlan from the &lt;a href="Australian%20Capital%20Territory"&gt;Australian Capital Territory&lt;/a&gt;, Lieutenant Matthew Goodall, Petty Officer Stephen Slattery and Leading Seaman Scott Bennett from &lt;a href="New%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;, and Lieutenant Jonathan King from &lt;a href="Queensland"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Australian%20Air%20Force"&gt;Royal Australian Air Force&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; lost Squadron Leader Paul McCarthy from Western Australia, Flight Lieutenant Lyn Rowbottom and Sergeant Wendy Jones from Queensland.

The bodies have not yet been removed from the wreckage.

Two other men who were onboard survived the accident are currently being treated for fractures on HMAS Kanimbla, which is stationed just off Nias.

Australian investigators have left for Indonesia to try to determine the cause of the crash. Witnesses who saw the accident, said the helicopter slammed into the ground nose first. People from the local village tried to help pull the two survivors free, but said the aircraft exploded into a fireball within five or ten minutes of impact, hindering the rescue.

<h1>FBI: Death of the Georgian Prime Minister was an accident</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=FBI%3A%20Death%20of%20the%20Georgian%20Prime%20Minister%20was%20an%20accident&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The death of the n Prime Minister, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASurab%20Schwania"&gt;Surab Schwania&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , on 3 February 2005 was an accident, which was caused by a faulty gas heater in the home of a friend. The United States Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) came to this conclusion following investigations in the apartment in {[w|Tbilisi}} and in their laboratories in the USA.

Bryan Paarman, legal attaché at the U.S. Embassy in Georgia who also leads the FBI office in Tbilisi, released details of the official investigation report at the news conference, which states that the late Prime Minister Schwania died of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acarbon%20monoxide"&gt;carbon monoxide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; poisoning. The poison concentration in his blood at the time of death amounted to 72%. Likewise his friend, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARaul%20Usupov"&gt;Raul Usupov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , with whom he had been staying, had 74% carbon monoxide in his blood at death. No other drugs or poisons were found in the blood of the two men.

Carbon monoxide, said the FBI, leaked from a defective gas heater that had been installed improperly a few weeks before it caused the death of the Prime Minister and his friend. The FBI had it tested in the apartment and stated the heater in the apartment caused the level of oxygen in the air to decrease to 18.4%. Such small oxygen percentage is lethal, explained the FBI.

Should such an event occur, it is widely believed that &lt;a href="w%3AFrancis%20Cardinal%20Arinze"&gt;Cardinal Francis Arinze&lt;/a&gt; of would be the most likely candidate. The 72 year old ♡❤Prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship♡❤ is known to be theologically conservative but very knowledgeable about the &lt;a href="w%3AIslam"&gt;Islamic&lt;/a&gt; religion, an important strength given recent hostilities between Christians and Muslims. Arinze was one of the five cardinals chosen by the Pope to sit on the ♡❤Committee of the Great Jubilee♡❤ in 2000.

If Cardinal Arinze becomes the next Pope, he would be the first African Pope in over 1,500 years - the last being &lt;a href="w%3APope%20Gelasius%20I"&gt;Pope Gelasius I&lt;/a&gt; who was the Pontiff from 492 to 496.

However in Nigeria such predictions have been met with mixed responses. A churchgoer in the state of &lt;a href="w%3AEnugu"&gt;Enugu&lt;/a&gt; told the ♡❤Reuters♡❤ news agency, "I doubt if world politics will allow a black man to be pope."

Protesters demonstrating against broke windows of the Japanese Ito-Yokado store on Saturday, in the city of &lt;a href="w%3AChengdu"&gt;Chengdu&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of &lt;a href="w%3ASichuan%20Province"&gt;Sichuan Province&lt;/a&gt;. ♡❤Kyodo News♡❤ reports the incident marks the first time Japanese property has been damaged in a protest in China.

The Japanese Consulate General reported about 30 people participated in vandalizing the store, and that hundreds of people had gathered during the three-hour long demonstration.

The protesters are part of a movement to stop Japan from becoming a member of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Security%20Council"&gt;U.N. Security Council&lt;/a&gt;. Chen Tong, editor-in-chief of the ♡❤sina.com♡❤ web site, says a petition with millions of signatures opposing Japan's appointment to the council will be presented to the U.N. and the Japanese Embassy in &lt;a href="w%3ABeijing"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt;.

UN Secretary-General &lt;a href="w%3AKofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt; recently proposed appointing Japan to the UNSC as part of an overhaul of the U.N. organization.

&lt;a href="w%3ATartan%20Day"&gt;Tartan Day&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; is being kicked off with big celebrations in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, including parades and marching bands. The Grand Marshall of this year's parade was &lt;a href="http%3A//www.imdb.com/name/nm0908824/"&gt;Randall Wallace&lt;/a&gt;, a Scottish-American and author of the screenplay for the movie &lt;a href="http%3A//www.imdb.com/title/tt0112573/"&gt;Braveheart&lt;/a&gt;.

Week-long festivities were to include the annual "Tunes of Glory" parades, pipe bands from 3 countries, an exhibition called "Scottish Village", and a fashion show on Wednesday called "Dressed to Kilt". One of Scotland's national treasures, &lt;a href="w%3AWilliam%20Wallace"&gt;William Wallace's&lt;/a&gt; sword, left Scotland for the first time in 700 years and was flown to New York for their Tartan Week celebrations of 2005.

Tartan Day was designated as a holiday by the &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Senate"&gt;US Senate&lt;/a&gt;, "National Tartan Day", in 1998. Support for the holiday first gathered momentum in &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; through the efforts of Ms. Jean Watson in the 1980s. The purpose of the holiday is to remember the contribution of &lt;a href="w%3AScotland"&gt;Scots&lt;/a&gt; both at home and abroad, raise the profile of Scotland, and encourage tourism and trade. 

The date of April 6 was chosen because the "&lt;a href="w%3ADeclaration%20of%20Arbroath"&gt;Declaration of Arbroath&lt;/a&gt;, the Scottish Declaration of Independence, was signed on April 6, 1320 and the American Declaration of Independence was modelled on that inspirational document." In &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, Tartan Day is celebrated on July 1, the anniversary of the repeal of the &lt;a href="w%3AAct%20of%20Proscription"&gt;Act of Proscription&lt;/a&gt; in 1782.

&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; in 2002 wrote a letter to the Scotsman newspaper supporting the annual celebrations, writing, "As you take part in customs that honour the role of Scottish Americans in our history, I join you in celebrating the contributions of these important Americans. This observance renews our appreciation for the diversity and remarkable heritage that unites us all." 

In the &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;US House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; on March 9 last month, seven years after the Senate approval, a voice vote was unanimously taken to declare "National Tartan Day" a national holiday. 

The number of Americans with Scottish or Scotch-Irish ancestry according to the 2000 US Census is about 9.2 million, comprising 3.2% of the US population.

A group from &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Qaeda"&gt;Al Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; claimed responsibility today for the Saturday evening prison attack at &lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Ghraib"&gt;Abu Ghraib&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; military revised casualty reports upward to 44 American soldiers and 12 Iraqi prisoners injured, some seriously.

The attack came at the end of a day that witnessed a series of violent attacks elsewhere throughout the country. Six other people were killed in Iraq yesterday, ending recent hopes that violence may be subsiding.

A &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Wide%20Web"&gt;Web&lt;/a&gt; statement posted by &lt;a href="w%3AIslamists"&gt;Islamists&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday said, "Your brothers in the al Qaeda Organization (for Holy War) in Iraq launched a well-planned attack on &lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Ghraib%20prison"&gt;Abu Ghraib prison&lt;/a&gt;, where Muslim women and men are held." The statement also says, "This battle is part of a series of raids."

The ♡❤GNN♡❤ reports U.S. Army 1st Lt. Adam Rondeau saying, “This was obviously a very well-organized attack and a very big attack.”

The Abu Ghraib prison, located 18 miles (30 km) west of &lt;a href="w%3ABagdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;, is still supervised by American forces following the notorious prisoner abuse scandal last year. Approximately 3,300 Iraqi detainees are held there.

The annual &lt;a href="w%3ASunday%20Times%20Rich%20List%202005"&gt;Sunday Times Rich List&lt;/a&gt; published today showed that &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; now has six euro billionaires, up from four last year. The combined wealth of Irelands 250 wealthiest is €42.3bn.

Topping the list was the new entrant &lt;a href="w%3AHilary%20Weston"&gt;Hilary Weston&lt;/a&gt; with a fortune estimated at over €7.2bn. Weston was excluded in previous lists because the majority of her wealth was made abroad, however a rule change this year allowed the &lt;a href="w%3ADublin"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt; born model to enter in first place. Mrs Weston, 63, grew up in Ireland and built her modeling career there before becoming wed to &lt;a href="w%3AGalen%20Weston"&gt;Galen Weston&lt;/a&gt;, heir to his grandfathers multi-billion euro retailing fortune in Canada. The couple permanently moved to &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; in 1983 after a kidnap attempt by the &lt;a href="Provisional%20IRA"&gt;IRA&lt;/a&gt;.

The top six on the list were as follows:

<ol>
BULLET::::1. ♡❤♡Hilary Weston and family;♡❤♡ €7.286bn - Retailing

The Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States (SIECUS) has written a March 31 &lt;a href="http%3A//www.siecus.org/policy/Advocates/advo0002.html"&gt;letter to Michael Leavitt&lt;/a&gt;, Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). The letter presents a number of complaints about the new HHS website for parents, called &lt;a href="http%3A//www.4parents.gov"&gt;4parents.gov&lt;/a&gt;.

An additional 145 advocacy groups have signed on to the letter, including notable liberal groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Planned Parenthood, and the National Organization for Women (NOW).

Among the concerns expressed in the letter about the website:
<ul>
BULLET::::- It contains factual errors and outdated terminology.
BULLET::::- It is politically biased, and only credits one non-governmental organization, the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.physicianscenter.org/"&gt;National Physicians Center for Family Resources&lt;/a&gt; (NPC), which the letter claims has "strong ties to right wing religious organizations like the California Family Council, Alabama Family Alliance, and Focus on the Family."
BULLET::::- It introduces anti-abortion language, such as referring to the developing fetus as an "unborn child" and defining that pregnancy begins at fertilization, rather than at implantation, the definition previously accepted by the HHS.
BULLET::::- It also "does not address the needs of many youth, including sexually active youth, youth who have been or are being sexually abused, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) youth."

</ul>
SIECUS further requested that the site be "immediately taken down and that a formal review of its content and techniques for communication and behavioral learning be launched," in which SIECUS and its related associations would be assisting.

According to the 4parents.gov website, " 4Parents.gov is part of a new national public education campaign to provide parents with the information, tools and skills they need to help their teens make the healthiest choices." Whether this implies that other websites or educational materials will be released in the near future was not made clear.

The site appeared to particularly focus on parent-child communication and the delivery of sex-ed information to parents in order to support that cause. The stated goal of this campaign is improvement of public health through the reduction of &lt;a href="w%3ASexually%20transmitted%20infection"&gt;sexually transmitted diseases&lt;/a&gt; (STDs) and other health-related issues that affect teens.

Deposed President of &lt;a href="w%3AKyrgyzstan"&gt;Kyrgyzstan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAskar%20Akayev"&gt;Askar Akayev&lt;/a&gt; said that he had signed his resignation in the Kyrgyz embassy in &lt;a href="w%3AMoscow"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt; Sunday. He said an official resignation ceremony would take place Monday.

The signing of his document came after two and a half hours of talks with a delegation from the Kyrgyz parliament, including Speaker Omurbek Tekebayev. Akayev said a resignation document was drawn up during the meeting.

"We have approved a very good and historic document," Akayev said after signing his resignation. It will "pave the way for finding a way of out the political crisis that Kyrgyzstan has found itself in."

Tekebayev said the agreement "will ensure peace and legitimacy."

While full details of the document were not available, Akayev said Russia and &lt;a href="w%3AKazakhstan"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt; were listed as guarantors. Akayev also said that under the agreement, parliament would pass a resolution recognizing his privileges as a former head of state - namely, immunity from prosecution. He and his family are widely seen as corrupt in Kyrgyzstan.

&lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; envoy Terje Roed-Larsen and &lt;a href="Syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;n Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara announced Sunday at a joint news conference that Syria will withdraw all troops and foreign intelligence agents by the April 30 deadline. The withdrawal would precede the upcoming national elections scheduled for May, and would end 25 years of Syrian military occupation in &lt;a href="Lebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;.

The news conference came after meetings in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADamascus"&gt;Damascus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; between Syrian President &lt;a href="Bashar%20al-Assad"&gt;Bashar al-Assad&lt;/a&gt; and the Lebanese army chief General Michel Suleiman that dealt with the withdrawal timetable. Roed-Larson said, "Syria has agreed that subject to the acceptance of the Lebanese authorities, a U.N. verification team will be dispatched to verify the [full withdrawal]."

The removal of Syrian military presence in Lebanon is a main sticking point of the anti-Syrian, or opposition group, objections towards forming a new government. After a February bombing assassination of the previous Lebanese Prime Minister &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARafik%20Hariri"&gt;Rafik Hariri&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who was also anti-Syrian, he was succeeded by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOmar%20Karami"&gt;Omar Karami&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Massive opposition group street protests forced the pro-Syrian Karami to resign, but a week later he was re-installed by President al-Assad to spear-head the new government's formation.

Mr. Karami has been unable to secure opposition group support for forming a new government. The Lebanese Parliament must act soon to form consensus in announcing new elections, or its legal mandate to do so will expire.

NASA is preparing the shuttle for its "Return to Flight" mission.

The rollout will take nearly 6 hours to cover the 4 mile stretch from the VAB to Launch Pad 39B and will begin at 12:01 a.m. EDT (04:01 UTC) on April 5. The fully assembled Space Shuttle Vehicle stack (orbiter, External Tank (ET) and twin Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs)) will be mounted on the Mobile Launcher Platform and delivered to the pad.

The Return to Flight mission is the 114th Space Shuttle flight, and the 31st flight of the orbiter Discovery.

<h1>Hunter S. Thompson obituary spawns &quot;murder&quot; theory</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Hunter%20S.%20Thompson%20obituary%20spawns%20%26quot%3Bmurder%26quot%3B%20theory&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Hunter Thompson, the author of "Hey Rube: Blood Sport, the Bush Doctrine, and the Downward Spiral of Dumbness", once discussed on radio the possibility that he would be murdered to shut him up &amp;mdash; and that it would be made to look like a suicide.

Paul William Roberts, a friend of Thompson and a well known travel writer, in an obituary played on this possibility for dramatic effect. Roberts related the fact that Thompson was working on a story relating to the World Trade Center demolition, and did say he was going to be murdered, and that the murder would be identified as a suicide. Roberts says in the second paragraph that Thompson did, however, commit suicide, and was not murdered. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.parapolitics.info/phorum/read.php%3Ff%3D4%26amp%3Bi%3D822%26amp%3Bt%3D822"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Two years ago in January 2003, Thompson actually did give an interview on KDNK radio (Colorado) where he made a suggestion that he may be murdered to shut him up.

"Bush is really the evil one here and it is more than just him. We are the Nazis in this game and I don't like it. I am embarrassed and I am pissed off. I mean to say something. I think a lot of people in this country agree with me...we'll see what happens to me if I get my head cut off next week -- it is always unknown or bushy-haired strangers who commit suicide right afterwards with no witnesses," the writer said.

More confusion has arisen after a quote from one of the police officers investigating the death scene. Deputy Ron Ryan said there was a spent shell casing, but there was no cartridge in the firing chamber, as there should have been under normal circumstances. Sheriff's officer DiSalvo confirmed this opinion; "I think a bullet from the magazine should have cycled into the chamber". This "single bullet" problem has led to speculation that Thompson was coerced into self-inflicting a gunshot wound, being given a gun with a single shot, perhaps accompanied by threats against his family.

Speculation arose that the gun used to kill Thompson could have been capable of a manual ammunition cycle, though as yet no support for this claim has been offered. DiSalvo said he hadn't checked the gun, but that the weapon could have been on a manual cycle that would have stopped the other cartridges from going into the chamber.

The spent slug was found in the stove's hood behind Hunter Thompson's body, investigators said.

Thompson died February 20. The county coroner ruled that Thompson's death was a suicide on February 21.

Other friends were not surprised at his death. "I wasn't surprised," said George Stranahan, a former owner of the Woody Creek Tavern, a favourite haunt of Thompson. "I never expected Hunter to die in a hospital bed with tubes coming out of him."

Neighbours have said how his broken leg had prevented him from leaving his house as often as he had liked to.

One neighbour and long-standing friend, Mike Cleverly, said Thompson was clearly hobbled by the broken leg. "Medically speaking, he's had a rotten year."

The Spanish government of &lt;a href="w%3AJose%20Luis%20Rodriguez%20Zapatero"&gt;Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero&lt;/a&gt; has reached an agreement with &lt;a href="w%3AVenezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt; for the sale of 10 C-295 medium transport military airplanes, two CN-235 Persuader maritime vigilance airplanes, and eleven ships, eight of them exclusively for military use.

The total value of the sales is about 1,3 billion euros. The agreement represents the biggest military sale ever made by &lt;a href="w%3ASpain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;. 

Several political and Spanish newspapers criticized Zapatero's decision. Mariano Rajoy, PP party leader, labeled the decision "a monstrous mistake". The Spanish newspaper ♡❤Diario de Sevilla♡❤ editorialized that "the destination of the weapon bought legally on the international market should not fraudulently go to armed, terrorist, and paramilitary groups, etc, that could use them unduly."

Venezuelan President &lt;a href="w%3AHugo%20Ch%C3%A1vez"&gt;Hugo Chávez&lt;/a&gt; said that "the weapons are not instruments of war but instruments of peace". According to Chávez, the ships will be used to step up Venezuela's coastal patrols against the drug trade.

&lt;a href="w%3AWen%20Jiabao"&gt;Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao&lt;/a&gt; visits &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; this week, appearing on the forefront of a dialogue soon opening between the two most populous nations in the world. It is likely the two nations will engage in a growing race to gain access to energy resources they need for their soaring economic expansion.

The premier was received by Tata Consulatncy Services CEO Mr. Ramadorai during his visit to &lt;a href="Bangalore"&gt;Bangalore&lt;/a&gt;. He then visited the TCS Global Development Center for General Motors(GM). The CEO of TCS was quoted saying "Premier Wen's visit is a significant milestone that has added a further impetus to our presence in &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;".

Both countries seek to secure oil from multiple locales around the globe where most Western nations cannot compete, including &lt;a href="Sudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Myanmar"&gt;Myanmar&lt;/a&gt;. China also is courting support from &lt;a href="Venezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;, currently one of the largest suppliers of oil to the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;. If successful, Chinese and Indian demand has the potential to create increasing difficulties for the US to fulfill its energy needs from traditional sources.

China and India, whose relations are sometimes troubled by border disputes, are warming up to each other. Analysts suggest that an agreement reached during the dialogues could preempt competition and conflict over oil in the future. 

India and China are partners in Sudan's Greater Nile Project, but cooperation between the two may not come easily. Indian industry may seek to shy away from extending assistance to a nation some view as an economic rival during the ascendancy of the subcontinent's &lt;a href="w%3AGross%20national%20product"&gt;GNP&lt;/a&gt;.

These events come at a time when the United States recently announced its intention to help India, a past rival of China, become a "superpower." India has also been planning military expansion and modernization.

Longstanding border issues will be on the top of the agenda at an upcoming meeting between &lt;a href="China"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; premier Wen Jiabao and top &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; leaders as Wen visit New Delhi this week.

Despite past military conflict, Wen has declared his intention that disputes will not stand in the way of cooperation.

Among the other issues to be discussed are energy cooperation, which many analysts, however, feel may not be as easy to attain as some hope, given the economic competition between the two rising giants.

These events come at a time when the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; has recently announced its intention to help India, a past rival of China, become a "superpower." India has also been planning military expansion/modernization.

As the case between film studio &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMetro%20Goldwyn%20Mayer"&gt;Metro Goldwyn Mayer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and file-sharing software firm &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGrokster"&gt;Grokster&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; continues in the &lt;a href="US%20Supreme%20Court"&gt;US Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt;, protesters from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AElectronic%20Frontier%20Foundation"&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (EFF) adopted a novel tactic. EFF Staff Technologist Seth Schoen arrived at the courthouse with several &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABetamax"&gt;Betamax tapes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . As &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJack%20Valenti"&gt;Jack Valenti&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , until recently the president of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMotion%20Picture%20Association%20of%20America"&gt;Motion Picture Association of America&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (MPAA), arrived, EFF Media Coordinator Annalee Newitz asked Valenti to sign one of the tapes; Valenti complied with her request.

In testimony before the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Congress"&gt;US Congress&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 1982, Valenti sided with an effort to outlaw &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASony"&gt;Sony's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; early video cassette recorder standard, Betamax. The Valenti testimony included the oft-quoted phrase, "I say to you that the VCR is to the American film producer and the American public as the Boston strangler is to the woman home alone."

The case now before the Supreme Court, MGM v. Grokster, has some similarities to the Betamax case of 1982. Both disputes concern new technologies used for copying media &amp;mdash; exclusively video in the earlier Betamax case, all-digital media in the current case of Grokster. There are dissimilarities as well. A recent statement from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARecording%20Artists%27%20Coalition"&gt;Recording Artists' Coalition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; spokesperson and professional singer, Sheryl Crow, points out that with Betamax technology, "a second copy turned out to be of measurably inferior quality," while with Grokster, "one could possibly distribute millions of perfectly reproduced copies." Crow also quotes an expurgated version of the copyright clause of the US Constitution,

"To promote the progress of...useful arts by securing ... to authors [sic] the exclusive right to their respective writings ..."

The original text reads:

"To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries;"

<h1>HBO plans expansion of TV channels in Asia</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=HBO%20plans%20expansion%20of%20TV%20channels%20in%20Asia&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
U.S. media giant &lt;a href="w%3ATime%20Warner"&gt;Time Warner&lt;/a&gt; plans to increase the international reach of its &lt;a href="w%3AHBO"&gt;HBO&lt;/a&gt; television empire with an expansion of television offerings in Asia. The channels will be available via both wired cable services and by satellite, which is more popular in Asia than it is in the United States.

"Cable operators throughout Asia are preparing to dramatically expand channel capacity on many of their systems through digital technology," Jonathan Spink, CEO of HBO Asia said in a ♡❤World Screen News♡❤ report. He said HBO plans to be one of the first programmers to take advantage of increased channel capacity.

The first new channel HBO plans to launch in Asia is HBO Signature, which is targeted to women. It is planned to debut in Singapore, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Macau and Sri Lanka by the end of the year. According to reports, HBO already has struck deals for carriage in all of those countries except Macau.

In addition to programming HBO Signature to women, the company said it plans on two other genre-based channels, but did not disclose what niches they would market toward. A clue could be to look to the U.S. where HBO's niche channels include HBO Family for children-friendly programming and the self-explanatory HBO Comedy channel. Like the parent HBO Asia channel, along with limited original programming, the new genre channels are expected to offer top Hollywood fare dubbed into local languages.

This is the largest expansion of HBO Asia, which has been operating in Asia since 1992 and serves 25 countries, since the launch of Cinemax Asia in 1996.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;, the Right Honourable &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; PC MP, at 09:00 UTC today formally requested the Queen to &lt;a href="w%3ADissolution%20of%20parliament"&gt;dissolve Parliament&lt;/a&gt; on April 11, thereby confirming May 5 to be the date for &lt;a href="w%3AUK%20general%20election%2C%202005/06"&gt;the next General Election&lt;/a&gt;.

Mr Blair had delayed the formal request for the dissolution of Parliament for 1 day, as a mark of respect for &lt;a href="w%3APope%20John%20Paul%20II"&gt;Pope John Paul II&lt;/a&gt;, who died on Saturday April 2. All political parties had suspended campaiging for two days; and Mr Blair and other politicians had been attending services to mourn the death of the Pope. 

<h3>Timetable for the dissolution of Parliament</h3>
The wedding of His Royal Highness &lt;a href="w%3ACharles%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales"&gt;Prince Charles&lt;/a&gt; had previously been scheduled for Friday April 8, and hence Members of Parliament (Lords and Commons) would have not sat on that day and would have stopped sitting on Thursday April 7. However, because of that subsequently being the date set for the funeral of Pope John Paul II, the wedding has been postponed to Saturday April 9. 

Members of Parliament (Lords and Commons) will thus stop sitting on Friday April 8. This leaves just four days for all remaining legislation to be passed. It is expected that some government bills will be simply dropped, to be reintroduced in the next Parliament if the &lt;a href="w%3ALabour%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Labour Party&lt;/a&gt; wins the General Election.

The last &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%27s%20Questions"&gt;Prime Minister's Question Time&lt;/a&gt; in the House of Commons is scheduled to be tomorrow, Wednesday April 6 at 11:00 UTC.

After the election, the new Parliament is scheduled to be summoned on Wednesday May 11. Its first business will be the election of the Speaker and the swearing-in of members. The State Opening of Parliament is scheduled to then be on Tuesday May 17.

<h3>General Election campaigns start</h3>
The calling of the General Election marks the formal beginning of the general election campaigns by the U.K. political parties, although in practice all three major parties have been actively campaigining for several weeks. The &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt; election slogan "Are you thinking what we're thinking?" was, for example, used by the party leader &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Howard"&gt;Michael Howard&lt;/a&gt; in his response to the Budget report on March 16, 2005 and was launched by the Scottish Conservatives on March 10.

Rescuers were today sending a pod of 13 &lt;a href="w%3APilot%20Whale"&gt;pilot whales&lt;/a&gt; back into the ocean at Geographe Bay, near to &lt;a href="w%3ABusselton%2C%20Western%20Australia"&gt;Busselton&lt;/a&gt;, south of &lt;a href="w%3APerth%2C%20Western%20Australia"&gt;Perth&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20Australia"&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt;. Six additional members of the pod had died during the stranding, including at least one calf. More than 300 people were watching as the whales set out to sea following a 30 hour rescue effort.

The whales had become stranded early yesterday. Several power boats and a spotter plane were escorting the surviving whales towards Cape Naturalist, in an operation expected to take several hours.

Western Australian State Government &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Conservation%20and%20Land%20Management"&gt;Department of Conservation and Land Management (CALM)&lt;/a&gt; officers feared that the whales could become stranded again.

One CALM officer, Neil Taylor, told ♡❤ABC News♡❤ dozens of his colleagues and community volunteers had helped the whales survive throughout the night.

"The &lt;a href="w%3AVeterinarian"&gt;vet&lt;/a&gt; has checked them all and given them some &lt;a href="w%3AAntibiotic"&gt;antibiotics&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, last thing before dark," he had told the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation"&gt;Australian national broadcaster&lt;/a&gt;.

"I think the plan is that the vet will be there again [today] and will give them some vitamins to kick them along before they actually take their swim out to sea."

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACharleston%2C%20South%20Carolina"&gt;Charleston, South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — The 28th &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ACooper%20River%20Bridge%20Run"&gt;Cooper River Bridge Run and Walk&lt;/a&gt;, a yearly event including the third-largest 10k race in the United States, was held Saturday across Charleston's Silas N. Pearman Bridge spanning the &lt;a href="w%3ACooper%20River"&gt;Cooper River&lt;/a&gt;. 

Linus Maiyo of Kenya, 22, and Olga Romanova of Russia, 24, won the men's and woman's races, respectively. Maiyo finished in 29:30 and Romanova in 34:04. Runners were treated to the "second worst weather" in the history of the race, according to race organizers. It rained for the first hour of the race and the first few minutes of the walk. The morning saw winds of up to 25 miles per hour with temperatures around 65°F.

Before race organizers closed registration early, over 42,000 people signed up for this year's event, vastly more than the record of 30,000 registrants set just last year. Participants represent all fifty states and many countries. The race's popularity has steadily increased since its inception in 1978. 

This may be the last year the race is held on the Pearman Bridge; future races will be held on the new Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge scheduled to open this summer. The Charleston Running Club, which helped start the Cooper River Bridge Run, plans a Burn the Bridges run over the old bridges after traffic moves to the new bridge.

Workers on the Ravenel Bridge cheered the runners and walkers as they passed.

This years Gmail bombshell is that there will be a possibility for infinite storage with Google already moving stroage up to 2GB thats what some paid services offer.

The funeral of is due to take place on Friday 8 April at 10 a.m. local time, on the steps of &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Peter%27s%20Basilica"&gt;St. Peter's Basilica&lt;/a&gt;.

At 5 p.m. Monday, his corpse was moved to the basilica, which was then opened for the public to pay homage to the dead Pope. The basilica will remain open almost around the clock tonight, and possibly throughout the week, closing only between 2 and 5 a.m.

After the funeral ceremony on Friday, his corpse will be buried in the ♡❤Grotte Vaticane♡❤ below St Peter's, the final resting place of many previous Popes. This decision came from the absence of a decision of the Pope in merit, in which case the tradition is followed.

The date was revealed at 1:15 p.m. today at a press conference held in Vatican City. 
Vatican city times are two hours ahead of GMT.

The has blocked the use of its advanced technology for mapping mineral deposits in , according to mining operation BHP Billiton (BHP).

"They can dictate where we can and can't use it," a BHP spokeswoman said.

♡❤The Australian♡❤ first reported the decision last week, after Clinton Dines, the chief of BHP's Chinese operations, told analysts about the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Navy"&gt;U.S. Navy's&lt;/a&gt; decision. BHP confirmed this story to ♡❤The New York Times♡❤ in &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; last Friday.

The U.S. maintains a list of munitions which are prohibited from being exported to China. &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Pentagon"&gt;Pentagon&lt;/a&gt; spokewoman Lt. Col. Tracy O'Grady-Walsh confirmed that the ♡❤Falcon♡❤ system was on the list of prohibited munitions and that it could not be exported for use in China without a waiver from the President. The ban has been in place since the Tiananmen Square incident in 1989.

The ♡❤Falcon♡❤ system, used by BHP under a special license from the U.S. Navy, is based upon American nuclear-submarine technology. Technically described as an "airborne gravity gradiometer", the ♡❤Falcon♡❤ system has been adapted by BHP to explore for a broad range of minerals underground. BHP has used the system since 2000. At the time, a BHP executive described the system as "the holy grail of the exploration industry."

BHP earns 10 percent of its revenue from sales to China.

Retired &lt;a href="w%3AAnglican"&gt;Anglican&lt;/a&gt; Arch-Bishop &lt;a href="w%3ADesmond%20Tutu"&gt;Desmond Tutu&lt;/a&gt; has called for the &lt;a href="w%3ACatholic%20church"&gt;Catholic church&lt;/a&gt; to appoint an African as new pope. "We hope the cardinals when they meet will follow the first non-&lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Apope"&gt;pope&lt;/a&gt; by electing the first African pope," said Tutu on SABC TV at a press conference in his Cape Town home.

&lt;a href="w%3ANigeria"&gt;Nigeria's&lt;/a&gt; Cardinal &lt;a href="w%3AFrancis%20Arinze"&gt;Francis Arinze&lt;/a&gt;, currently number four in the church hierarchy, is seen as the best hope for a pope from the third world. If Arinze is elected he will become the first African pope since &lt;a href="w%3AGelasius%20I"&gt;Gelasius I&lt;/a&gt; in 496 AD.

"There should be democracy in the Catholic Church. Europeans should allow an African to become the next pope," said 21 year old Nigerian student, Ifeoma Ezinwa, at the Saint Monica Catholic Church in Igbogbo, &lt;a href="w%3ALagos"&gt;Lagos&lt;/a&gt;. "The church is growing in Africa. If Arinze gets to that position, he would work for its faster growth," she continued.

However Steve Uwagba, a Nigerian accountant, thought that "International politics in the church may not allow him to get the papal seat. The odds of international politics and conspiracy against Africa weigh heavily against him."

<h3>Africa mourns</h3>
Tutu also added that "We know that [the pope] was a champion for world peace. And more than any other pope [he] went around the world galvanizing the faithful who turned out in droves to meet him. We also want to pay tribute to him for his concern for the unity of humankind. He was the first Pope, I think, to gather together ... leaders of other Christian denominations, calling them to prayer for the world,"

The archbishop of &lt;a href="w%3ACape%20Town"&gt;Cape Town&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ANjongonkulu%20Ndungane"&gt;Njongonkulu Ndungane&lt;/a&gt; - Tutu's successor - offered his condolences to the world's catholics. "Our sincerest condolences go out to Catholics worldwide on the death of their great leader. We thank God for his ministry and that he has now been relieved from pain,"

Father Stephen Chukwu of St Augustine's church in Ikorodu on the outskirts of Lagos, Nigeria said to a congregation of three thousand, "The whole world is standing still. People are held spellbound because the mighty has fallen. The whole church mourns because a leader and a revolutionary has gone," he told the crowd, many of whom wept and sobbed.

"Who would ever believe that a pope could come from outside Rome? He was an ideal man and he led an ideal life. He held tenaciously to the teachings of the Apostles. He was against killing and abortion," he declared. He was not a friend of the wealthy or the mighty. He was a friend of those in the gutters. He preached and fought for democracy.

After mass Mary Okoli, a 42 year old teacher said "My hope and prayer is that we get an African, especially a Nigerian, to replace him and continue his good work,"
"We are particularly grateful for the attention he paid to Africa and the developing world during his papacy. His concern for the poor marked him as a truly caring leader and we share the grief and loss of the Catholic Church at his passing. We also pray for the Catholic Church as it contemplates the election of the next Vicar of Christ," he said in a statement.

Interplanetary space probes &lt;a href="w%3AVoyager%201"&gt;Voyager 1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AVoyager%202"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, after traveling 28 years
and 14 billion kilometers to the edge of the solar system and the
threshold of interstellar space, face a possible shutdown in October
of this year.

&lt;a href="NASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;'s Earth-Sun System division, which runs the program, amongst
others, has had to cut its budget for next year from 74 million to 53
million dollars, calling for some project abandonments. The cuts for
Voyager and other missions are planned to help fund President George
W. Bush's "Vision for Space Exploration", his plan to return to the moon
and a manned mission to Mars.

According to the Washington Post, Dick Fisher, NASA's deputy director
for the Earth-Sun division, said the agency based its cuts on a
"senior review" by outside experts, giving Voyager a low priority
among the division's 13 "extended" missions.

It costs NASA $4.2 million a year to run the Voyager science
programs which have an expected operating lifetime to the year 2020.
Both spacecraft function well and continue to return valuable
scientific data. Most recently, information about massive solar
flares that occurred in 2003 and the resulting shock waves that
traveled through the solar system were detected by Voyager 2 in April
of 2004.

"There are no other plans to reach the edge of the solar system," said
Stamatios Krimigis, on board the Voyager mission since before the
launch in 1977. "Now we're getting all this new information, and here
comes NASA saying, 'We want to pull the plug.' "

Other missions possibly affected by the budget cuts include: Ulysses,
to study the sun; Geotail, Wind, and Polar studying effects of solar
events on Earth; Fast Auroral SnapshoT (FAST), studying Earth's aurora
and the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE), studying solar
atmosphere and magnetic fields.

No final decisions have been made as of yet but are expected to come
sometime this month, possibly by April 15. Edward Stone of the
California Institute of Technology told Nature magazine: "We are
currently developing a plan for shutdown."

<h1>Talks held to avert Nigerian oil production strike</h1>
♡❤♡April 4, 2005♡❤♡

Talks are being held between Nigerian unions and the country's government ahead of possible strikes next week. Earlier talks last week ended with no agreement.

The unions have called for three-day warning strikes over issues of job cuts and welfare. Although common, such short strikes tend to have little effect on oil producers as they can often manage to maintain production for short periods with non-union staff.

However there exists the possibility of supply interruptions from the world's eighth largest producer of oil if the union's fears are not dealt with and more strikes take place.

"Today's meeting is crucial," said the deputy of the Pengassan union Babatunde Ogun. "We will focus on Conoil and Belpop. If these issues can be resolved today, then things will be much easier," he continued, referring to the two state-owned companies at the centre of the dispute.

While in London on late Sunday the Nigerian Presidential Petroleum Advisor Edmund Daukoru said he was hopeful the state and the unions could reach a deal.

<h1>Royal wedding delayed as Prince plans for Pope's funeral</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Royal%20wedding%20delayed%20as%20Prince%20plans%20for%20Pope%27s%20funeral&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The wedding of Britain’s &lt;a href="%3Aw%3APrince%20Charles"&gt;Prince Charles&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ACamilla%20Parker%20Bowles"&gt;Camilla Parker Bowles&lt;/a&gt; was postponed by one day to allow Prince Charles to represent the Royals at Friday's funeral of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3APope%20John%20Paul%20II"&gt;Pope John Paul II&lt;/a&gt;. The Royal's wedding will now be celebrated on Saturday, April 9.

The Prince cut short his Swiss skiing holiday and returned to London today. He will make travel arrangements for his trip to &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AVatican"&gt;The Vatican&lt;/a&gt; on Friday, and attend a memorial service for the pope at London’s &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AWestminster%20Cathedral"&gt;Westminster Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; this afternoon. Mrs. Parker Bowles will accompany him today, according to his Clarence House office.

Parker Bowles will not be joining Prince Charles for the Pope's funeral. However, Prime Minister Tony Blair and the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AArchbishop%20of%20Canterbury"&gt;Archbishop of Canterbury&lt;/a&gt;, Rowan Williams, will be in attendance.

The change in wedding plans threw Windsor businesses in disarray, where hotels had taken bookings for Friday wedding parties. The owner of a crafts center there, Kashmir Dhillon, had to order fresh tea towels with the April 9 date. “We will be the only ones with the 9th on it if it goes ahead,” she said.

A series of postponements have hampered the Prince's and Parker Bowles' wedding arrangements. Initially they were planning to use &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AWindsor%20Castle"&gt;Windsor Castle&lt;/a&gt;, but were unable since it was not licensed for civil ceremonies. After it moved to a more meager town hall setting, the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AQueen"&gt;Queen&lt;/a&gt; decided not to attend, immediately generating rumors of a royal snub.

The Queen will still attend the blessing ceremony at &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AWindsor%20Castle"&gt;Windsor Castle&lt;/a&gt; afterwards.

There also was debate over what name Parker Bowles would take should her husband become King. Prince Charles liked “princess consort,” but the government says she must be called “queen,” whether she uses the title or not.

Final arrangements for the wedding will be announced soon, according to the prince's spokesperson.

Prince Charles divorced his first wife, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3APrincess%20Diana"&gt;Princess Diana&lt;/a&gt; in 1996, a year before she died in an automobile accident in Paris.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFrank%20Clair"&gt;Frank Clair&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Football%20League"&gt;Canadian Football League&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (CFL) coach and architect of the powerhouse &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOttawa%20Rough%20Riders"&gt;Ottawa Rough Riders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the 1960s and 70s died Sunday at the age of 87 in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASarasota%2C%20Florida"&gt;Sarasota&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFlorida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Nicknamed "The Professor" for his skills at recognising talent, teaching the game, and ability to get the most from players, Clair first came to Canada to coach the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AToronto%20Argonauts"&gt;Toronto Argonauts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 1950 and ended his first CFL year with a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGrey%20Cup"&gt;Grey Cup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; championship; repeating with the Argos in 1952. He left the Argonauts following a salary dispute and ended up in Ottawa in 1956 where he took on the daunting task of reviving the Rough Riders team which were poorly run and disorganised. He led the team to an incredible 14 consecutive seasons of playoff appearances and three Grey Cups.

He retired from coaching following the 1969 Grey Cup to take over the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ageneral%20manager"&gt;general manager&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; position. At that time, Clair led the CFL in seasons coached (19), regular-season victories (147), playoff seasons (17), consecutive playoff seasons (14), playoff victories (22), Grey Cup appearances (six) and Grey Cup victories (five). His winning ways continued as GM when Ottawa won the 1973 and 1976 Grey Cups. Nevertheless, he was let go in 1978 and Ottawa has not won a Grey Cup since.

According to the ♡❤Ottawa Sun♡❤, former sports editor Jane O'Hara described Clair as a no-nonsense, to-the-point, type of gentleman who was short on smiles, but always seen coaching his team wearing a snap-brim fedora and standing poker-faced and erect on the sidelines.

He was inducted into the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Football%20Hall%20of%20Fame"&gt;CFL Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 1981 as a builder and the Ottawa stadium (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFrank%20Clair%20Stadium%20at%20Lansdowne%20Park"&gt;Frank Clair Stadium at Lansdowne Park&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) was renamed in his honour in 1993.

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Schiavo"&gt;Michael Schiavo's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; lawyer informed the media that &lt;a href="Terri%20Schiavo"&gt;Terri Schiavo&lt;/a&gt;'s body was &lt;a href="wikt%3Acremation"&gt;cremated&lt;/a&gt; last Saturday at 9 a.m. on April 2nd at the National Cremation Society in &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;.

A complete &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aautopsy"&gt;autopsy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was done prior to the cremation to dispel any beliefs that the cremation was done to hide anything about Schiavo's condition. According to the district medical examiner's office in Largo, full results of the autopsy will not be ready for several weeks.

Terri Schiavo's parents, the Schindlers, requested an independent expert to observe the operation, but the request was denied by medical examiners.

Both sides of Terri Schiavo's family plan to have separate funerals. Mr. Schiavo apparently plans to bury Terri's remains in Pennsylvania, while the Schindlers are planning a funeral mass tomorrow at the Holy Name of Jesus Catholic Church in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGulfport%2C%20Florida"&gt;Gulfport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Florida.

Chinese Catholics' response to the recent death of pontiff &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Paul%20II"&gt;John Paul II&lt;/a&gt; have motivated more actions against free speech and arrests in China by the government, AsiaNews reports. 

At the same time as the Chinese government is expressing condolences for the death of John Paul II, it has begun the arrest of dozens of &lt;a href="w%3ACatholic"&gt;Catholics&lt;/a&gt;, particularly among the underground church. The &lt;a href="w%3AVatican"&gt;Vatican&lt;/a&gt; has already protested the arrest of Catholic leaders. Some of the most recent arrests include auxiliary bishop Yao Liang on 31 March and Father Wang Jinling on 1 April, both from Hebei province dioceses.

Many other Catholic leaders have been arrested without having charges brought against them.

Various websites have apparently been censored by the government. Likewise, many online forums and chat groups discussing the figure and life of John Paul II have appeared, yet, on 2 April, almost all news about the pope disappeared, stated AsiaNews.

One Chinese priest is reported as declaring, "the pope knew communism, and has always helped and encouraged us to live the faith and to be courageous in the face of persecution," AsiaNews quoted.

Alongside the Catholic Patriotic Organization, the government-approved church's official name, underground churches throughout China have been holding religious services.

A statement from the president's office said Mr. Osomo was sacked after the sale of public property violated instructions. According to a ♡❤BBC♡❤ report, the Minister allocated more than 200 properties to top officials rather than going on public sale.

President Obasanjo has been vocal in tackling corruption and reportedly warned officials their greed is undermining his attempts to win international debt relief. In March, he fired Education Minister Fabian Osuji in a broadcast to the nation during which he said 14 people had been involved in fraud and accused Mr. Osuji of offering a bribe of 55 million &lt;a href="w%3Anaira"&gt;naira&lt;/a&gt; (US$417,000) to senate president Adolfus Wabara in order to get a bigger budget for his ministry.

<h1>US Highway Administration releases interim report on Boston's Big Dig: press release claims tunnel safe, but report does not</h1>
♡❤♡April 6, 2005♡❤♡

&lt;br&gt;
On April 4, the Federal Highway Administration released an &lt;a href="http%3A//www.fhwa.dot.gov/reports/centralarterytunnel/tlabcainterim.pdf"&gt;interim report&lt;/a&gt; on leaks in the Central Artery Tunnel, part of Boston's Big Dig. The &lt;a href="http%3A//www.fhwa.dot.gov/pressroom/fhwa0503.htm"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; about the report claims that the report "concludes that the project is structurally sound and remains safe for traffic." However, the report does not reach those conclusions.

The report does not evaluate the current safety level of the tunnel; and on the subject of safety, it notes that ensuring the safety of the tunnel will require speedy implementation of a permanent repair of last September's major leak. The safety claim is repeated and touted as a "rare bit of good news" about the Big Dig in &lt;a href="http%3A//www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2005/04/04/federal_report_concludes_big_dig_tunnels_are_safe/"&gt;an Associated Press story by Steve Leblanc&lt;/a&gt;.

The Central Artery Tunnel, which allows Interstate 93 to pass beneath downtown Boston, experienced a 300 gallon-per-minute leak of water into the tunnel in September of 2004, according to the recent report. Mac Daniel of the Boston Globe notes in a &lt;a href="http%3A//www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2005/04/01/more_flaws_discovered_in_big_dig_wall_panels/"&gt;recent article&lt;/a&gt; that the September leak caused "a 10-mile traffic jam".

In response to the leak, the Federal Highway Administration formed the Tunnel Leak Assessment Team to provide an independent assessment of the leaking in the tunnel and the efficacy of the repairs underway.

The report reaches three main conclusions:
<ul>
BULLET::::- "Chronic low level leaks" continue, but sealing work is expected to seal them "in the summer of 2005".
BULLET::::- A temporary repair of the major leak which occurred in mid-September, 2004, has been completed, and permanent repairs are "under review".
<dl>
BULLET::::- Regarding permanent repairs, it adds, "Whichever option is selected must be implemented quickly to ensure the safe and uninterrupted passage of the traveling public."
</dl>
BULLET::::- "Additional defects" have been discovered in the slurry wall panels where September's major leak occurred.
<dl>
BULLET::::- In response to these discoveries, the report recommends, "The Project is encouraged to quickly complete the inspection of all panels and develop a standardized inspection process and related documentation."

</dl>
</ul>
According to the ♡❤New York Times♡❤, Matthew Amorello, chairman of the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority, praised the report, stating that, "This independent affirmation that the I-93 tunnels are safe and structurally sound will allow drivers to use them with confidence."

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco%2C%20California"&gt;San Francisco, California&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — A year after buying the struggling &lt;a href="w%3ANewsworld%20International"&gt;Newsworld International&lt;/a&gt; 24-hour U.S. and Canada cable news channel, former U.S. vice president &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Gore"&gt;Al Gore&lt;/a&gt; and his partner, millionaire &lt;a href="w%3AOhio"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt; attorney and politician &lt;a href="w%3AJoel%20Hyatt"&gt;Joel Hyatt&lt;/a&gt;, plan to re-launch the channel with a new name, a new concept and a new target audience.

Starting August 1, the channel will be known as Current and will aim its news programming at the 18-34 year old demographic that traditionally does not tune into cable news. "The Internet opened a floodgate for young people whose passions are finally being heard, but TV hasn't followed suit. Young adults have a powerful voice, but you can't hear that voice on television ... yet," Gore said in a press release issued from the network's San Francisco studios.

Gore said the new channel will be partly created by citizen journalists, where viewer-created reports will find their way on air. "We want to transform the television medium itself, giving a national platform to those who are hungry to help create the TV they want to watch. We're creating a powerful new brand of television that doesn't treat audiences as merely viewers, but as collaborators," Gore said in the release. The network posted submission guidelines on its new website which launched Monday.

Gore bought Newsworld International (NWI) from &lt;a href="w%3AVivendi%20Universal"&gt;Vivendi Universal&lt;/a&gt; last year for $70 million. It was the only TV asset of Vivendi's not snapped up by NBC in the creation of the &lt;a href="w%3ANBC%20Universal"&gt;NBC Universal&lt;/a&gt; media conglomerate. NBC already had two struggling cable news channels of its own. NWI's current news content is mostly rebroadcasts of news produced by the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation"&gt;Canadian Broadcasting Corporation&lt;/a&gt;.

Originally, the network was going to be remodled as a liberal counterpart to the popular &lt;a href="w%3AFox%20News%20Channel"&gt;Fox News Channel&lt;/a&gt;, which some critics claim is a conservative-slanted newscast despite the network's denial that it is "fair and balanced" in its reporting. But after market research, the new owners of NWI decided that a liberal news network was not financially feasible.

Instead, they focused on a youth-skewed news channel under the code name "INdTV" (pronounced "Indy Tee Vee"). The new name, Current, and re-launch date announcement was timed to coincide with the annual National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Association convention, which is being held this week in San Francisco, the same city as Channel's new headquarters.

<h1>Abu Ghraib prison camp struck by tractor bomb</h1>
♡❤♡April 5, 2005♡❤♡ 

A suicide tractor bombing struck the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; held &lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Ghraib"&gt;Abu Ghraib&lt;/a&gt; prison camp Monday, the 2nd attack in two days. Four Iraqi civilians are reported wounded.

The explosion occurred near the gates to the prison camp, and comes on the heels of a large attack earlier on Saturday, where both &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; soldiers and &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraqi&lt;/a&gt; detainees were injured. The apparent motive of the Saturday attack was to free detainees.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Times"&gt;♡❤New York Times♡❤&lt;/a&gt; reports that an official of the Interior Ministry said a letter was written by a woman who claims to be a detainee at the prison. In the letter, she reportedly begs to have the prison attacked to save her from the dishonor of rape by her American captors. The letter was circulated among &lt;a href="w%3ASunni"&gt;Sunni&lt;/a&gt; mosques.

An internet posting by the &lt;a href="w%3AJordon"&gt;Jordanian&lt;/a&gt; militant &lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Musab%20al-Zarqawi"&gt;Abu Musab al-Zarqawi&lt;/a&gt; claims responsibility for both the Abu Ghraib attacks. The &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Qaeda"&gt;Al Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; militant group also claimed responsibility for the first attack.

The report of the tractor bombing came as military officials were announcing that a short riot broke out Friday in another American prison called &lt;a href="w%3ACamp%20Bucca"&gt;Camp Bucca&lt;/a&gt;. Rocks were thrown and tents set on fire during a protest over several prisoners who were being transferred. Four guards and twelve prisoners were injured.

The Camp Bucca facility holds about 6,000 detainees, while Abu Ghraib holds 3,300.

Satellite images are provided by Keyhole Corp. which was acquired by Google six months ago. Satellite images will be at least 6 months old. According to John Hanke, Keyhole's general manager, nobody will be able to read a license plate on a car from an image or see what an individual doing at the time it was taken.

The laptops will be used by children in the developing world.

The project aims to allow children to take a laptop home after school hours, to enable more families to "cross the digital divide".

The laptops will have a processing power of 500MHz; 1GB storage; a 1 Megapixel, 12 inch display; and &lt;a href="w%3AUSB"&gt;USB&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AWi-Fi"&gt;Wi-Fi&lt;/a&gt;, and cell phone connectivity.

Terry Vo, the 10-year old Australian boy who had two hands and a foot reattached by surgeons after losing them in an accident, has had to have the foot re-amputated. He will be given a prosthetic foot in its place.

The operation to re-attach three limbs was thought to have been a first - but was ultimately unsuccessful, with the foot having died inside, and receiving insufficient blood supply following the surgery to reattach it.

"That would lead to the small muscles in the foot actually constricting, the toes bending over and a deformed ... foot that is sort of clawed over and doesn't have good sensation," said plastic surgeon, Mr Robert Love today, on Australia's ABC Radio.

"Even if you can get all of that to survive, he [would be] worse off than having had an amputation."

"What is very disappointing is that for the first two days after [the operation] the foot looked absolutely magnificent," he said.

Terry's hands were healing well, said the surgeon. The prosthetic foot would allow him to walk normally, since his knee was intact.

If recent trends are to portend the future, late Roman Catholic pontiff &lt;a href="John%20Paul%20II"&gt;John Paul II&lt;/a&gt; may be known to posterity as "John Paul the Great."

A growing portion of Catholics, and even senior clergy, have begun to use the title, which has been held previously by only three out of history's 264 popes.
&lt;a href="w%3APope%20Gregory%20I"&gt;Pope Gregory I&lt;/a&gt; of the sixth century, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APope%20Leo%20I"&gt;Leo I&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the fifth century, and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APope%20Nicholas%20I"&gt;Nicholas I&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the ninth century up to now, have alone been acclaimed "Great" in church tradition.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACardinal%20Egan"&gt;Cardinal Egan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of New York, Cardinal O'Brien of Edinburgh (Scotland), Dublin's Archbishop Martin, and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACardinal%20Cormac%20Murphy%20O%27Connor"&gt;Cardinal Cormac Murphy O'Connor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of Westminster &amp;mdash; the highest Catholic clergyman in England and Wales &amp;mdash; have been among those reported to have used the honorific for John Paul II.

Historian Robert Louis Wilken, writing in Catholic periodical ♡❤&lt;a href="http%3A//www.commonwealmagazine.org/"&gt;Commonweal&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ in 2003, "Greatness is as mysterious as it is elusive," alluding to the ambiguity of the criteria used in applying the title. 

For instance, some figures &amp;mdash; such as theologian &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Thomas%20Aquinas"&gt;St. Thomas Aquinas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; or the apostle &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASaint%20Peter"&gt;Peter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the first pope &amp;mdash; despite their wide influence in church history, have not been granted the honorific by historians or Catholic tradition, while others relatively unknown today were indeed accorded it. 

Newspapers in Italy, the United States, and throughout the globe have featured the acclamation "Great" for the deceased pontiff. Catholic-oriented websites and online forums, as well, abound with the title.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHoly%20See"&gt;Holy See&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's official paper, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AOsservatore%20Romano"&gt;L’Osservatore Romano&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, also echoed the "Great" appellation. 

Moreover, a Vatican homily text for Sunday, 3 April, contained a reference to the title. Though the honorific was ultimately not used during the homily's delivery by Cardinal &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAngelo%20Sodano"&gt;Angelo Sodano&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACardinal%20Secretary%20of%20State"&gt;Cardinal Secretary of State&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; until John Paul II's death, it is maintained that Vatican documents can be considered official even when not read aloud.

Health officials in &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Jose%2C%20California"&gt;San Jose, California&lt;/a&gt; are still unable to identify the owner of the missing finger found in a bowl of chili at a local &lt;a href="w%3AWendy%27s"&gt;Wendy's&lt;/a&gt; restaurant last week. 

Fingerprints on the detached digit have been run through an &lt;a href="w%3AFBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; database as well as the local criminal database in &lt;a href="w%3ASanta%20Clara%20County%2C%20California"&gt;Santa Clara County&lt;/a&gt;, but no matches were found. According to Rich Reneau, who is currently leading the investigation, the fingerprint was marginal, and the likelihood of finding a match is slim.

The finger is also undergoing &lt;a href="w%3ADNA"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt; tests by the county medical examiner, which could determine the race and gender of the owner of said finger.

Plans for a toxicology lab to run tests on the finger to see if the tissue contains preservative chemicals, such as embalming compounds are underway.

According to Lt. Chris Forrester, the coroner may end up hiring a private lab to run further tests on the finger.

Wendy's International stock was trading at US$39.37 Tuesday morning, relatively unchanged from its levels last week, before the news hit the stock markets.

As Chinese premier Wen Jiabao continues his tour across South Asia, visiting first India and now Pakistan, it has been announced that Pakistan will purchase frigate warships from China. 

China has also previously declared its hope of cooperation with India's government.

A &lt;a href="w%3Afrigate"&gt;frigate&lt;/a&gt; is a warship typically used to protect other naval vessels or merchant marine ships and to combat enemy submarines.

Pakistan and India have traditionally been considered rivals. Both nations, however, have garnerned favor and support from the US in recent times. 

Pakistan has granted much support to the American campaign against terrorists in Central Asia. The United States has recently announced its intention to help India, a past rival of China, become a "&lt;a href="w%3Asuperpower"&gt;superpower&lt;/a&gt;." India has also been planning military expansion/modernization. The United States has also declared its willingness to supply F-16 fighter jets to Pakistan as well.

<h1>ACLU: Gen. Sanchez possibly perjured himself at 2004 Senate inquiry</h1>

The &lt;a href="American%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union"&gt;American Civil Liberties Union&lt;/a&gt; (ACLU) claims that a recently obtained 18-month-old memo shows that a top &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; commander of armed forces in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; was untruthful when he testified before the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Congress"&gt;United States Congress&lt;/a&gt; last year on Iraqi prison abuse. The September 14, 2003 memo was among government documents concerning the U.S. invasion of Iraq. The ACLU gained access to the documents after successfully suing the government under the U.S. &lt;a href="w%3AFreedom%20of%20Information%20Act"&gt;Freedom of Information Act&lt;/a&gt;.

The 2003 memo seemingly contradicts sworn testimony by Sanchez given during the &lt;a href="w%3ASenate%20Hearing%20on%20Iraq%20Prison%20Abuse"&gt;Senate Hearing on Iraq Prison Abuse&lt;/a&gt;. Intentionally being untruthful at a Congressional hearing is considered the crime of &lt;a href="w%3Aperjury"&gt;perjury&lt;/a&gt;.

On May 19th, 2004, during those hearings, &lt;a href="w%3AJack%20Reed"&gt;Jack Reed&lt;/a&gt;, a Democratic U.S. &lt;a href="w%3ASenate"&gt;senator&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="Rhode%20Island"&gt;Rhode Island&lt;/a&gt;, asked Sanchez about claims of abuse of Iraqi prisoners under U.S. care. "General Sanchez, today's ♡❤&lt;a href="USA%20Today"&gt;USA Today&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, sir, reported that you ordered or approved the use of sleep deprivation, intimidation by guard dogs, excessive noise and inducing fear as an interrogation method for a prisoner in Abu Ghraib prison," Reed asked Sanchez. "Is that correct?"

"Sir, that may be correct that it's in a news article, but I never approved any of those measures to be used within CJTF-7 at any time in the last year." He then reiterated, "I have never approved the use of any of those methods within CJTF-7 (Coalition Joint Task Force-7) in the 12.5 months that I've been in Iraq," Gen. Sanchez's answered at the hearing.

But Sanchez's 2004 answer is at odds with the 2003 memo bearing his signature, which specifically addressed sleep deprivation ("sleep management"), intimidation by guard dogs ("presence of military working dog"), excessive noise ("yelling, loud music, and light control"), and inducing fear ("fear up harsh"). The following are excerpts from the memo:
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The label "S/NF" stands for Secret/Not Releasable to Foreign Nationals. Information is properly exempted from The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) if it contains National Security Information.

The only section in the memo that Gen. Sanchez labeled "U" for Unclassified was:
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The ACLU said it sent a letter to Attorney General &lt;a href="Alberto%20Gonzales"&gt;Alberto Gonzales&lt;/a&gt; requesting an "Investigation of Possible Perjury by General Ricardo A. Sanchez" and renewing their prior request "for an Outside Special Counsel to Investigate and Prosecute Violations or Conspiracies to Violate Criminal Laws Against Torture or Abuse of Detainees."

Irish betting shop chain, &lt;a href="w%3APaddy%20Power"&gt;Paddy Power&lt;/a&gt;, is taking bets for a new Pope. The current front runners are &lt;a href="w%3AFrancis%20Cardinal%20Arinze"&gt;Cardinal Francis Arinze of Nigeria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ADionigi%20Cardinal%20Tettamanzi"&gt;Cardinal Dionigi Tettamanzi of Italy&lt;/a&gt;, who have each been given odds of 11-4.

"Our feeling is, we held off a few days, and now the cardinals themselves are convening in Rome," Darren Haines, a spokesman for Paddy Power said.

"We do it very much in the same way as a horse race," Haines added, "Without sounding so callous, in a sense, we have contenders, and you very much rate the speculation on the contenders, very much by going on media reports in the religious press ... Our trading manager is very clued up on this, though she hasn't had divine intervention."

"This is not reasonable," Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang told reporters. "This is unfair. This is protectionist."

The U.S. administration justified their decision by presenting data which showed increases of over one thousand percent for cotton knit shirts and cotton trousers. The administration also cited a 300 percent increase of imports of underwear.

Qin disputed the U.S. reasoning for the decision.

"The major reason for this issue is that the United States has over-protectionist, irrational and unreasonable arrangements," he said.

"Other countries that are more competitive will still take over from China, and the US can't impose safeguards on those countries," Peter Liu, chairman of the textiles and apparel committee at the American Chamber of Commerce, told the ♡❤Financial Times♡❤ in Hong Kong. "Obviously, the US textile industry has concerns about job elimination, but on the other hand there are a lot of US industries that like to do business with China by exporting to China. If this escalates into a trade war, that's to nobody's benefit," he said.

The U.S. Association of Importers of Textiles and Apparel (AITA) also supports China's product imports.

"There is no reason to believe that imports of these products from China are causing market disruption," AITA spokeswoman Laura E. Jones said.

The U.S. administration cited a need to avoid "market disruption."

"Free trade must be fair trade, and we will work to ensure that American manufacturers and workers compete on a level playing field," read a statement issued by U.S. Commerce department spokeman Carlos M. Gutierrez. "The decision is the first step in a process to determine whether the U.S. market for these products is being disrupted and whether China is playing a role in that disruption." The statement also said the administration was "providing assistance to our domestic textile and apparel industry consistent with our international rights and obligations."

"We are very pleased that the government is taking this action," Lloyd Wood, a spokesman for the American Manufacturing Trade Coalition told ♡❤The New York Times♡❤. "It sends a strong message to China that predatory trade practices will be investigated."

The U.S. Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements issued its decision on Monday, under the rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO). China joined the WTO in 2001.

Shirts, trousers, and underwear are one of the few remaining types of clothing manufactured in the United States. The United States is running an all-time high trade deficit with China of US$162 billion.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Talk-therapy%20can%20make%20a%20difference%20in%20early%20treatment%20of%20severe%20depression&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

An individual in the initial stages of moderate to severe &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Adepression"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; may experience relief from &lt;a href="%3Awiktionary%3Acognitive"&gt;cognitive&lt;/a&gt; therapy equivalent to careful drug therapy. This is the conclusion from the April issue of the Archives of General Psychiatry, a publication of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AThe%20Journal%20of%20the%20American%20Medical%20Association"&gt;The Journal of the American Medical Association&lt;/a&gt;’s “Archives.”

Although antidepressant medications are the most widely used and effective treatment, cognitive, or talk-therapy, under the direction of highly trained professionals, has now shown potential in treating the early stages of major depressive disorder.

An eight week study by researchers at the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AUniversity%20of%20Pennsylvania"&gt;University of Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AVanderbilt"&gt;Vanderbilt&lt;/a&gt; University examined the response of 240 depressed patients, randomly placed into three groups. The first group (n=120) received &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Apsychological"&gt;psychological&lt;/a&gt; therapy; the second (n=60) a more traditional drug routine, and the third group (n=60) only pills.

The study found that both treated groups recovered wellness much better than the placebo group. At eight weeks, the medication group was at 50 per cent, the cognitive therapy group was at 43 per cent while the pill placebo group had only a 25 per cent improvement.

After 16 weeks both medically treated groups had about 58 per cent improvement. &lt;a href="%3Awiktionary%3ARemission"&gt;Remission&lt;/a&gt; rates were better with the antidepressant medications at 46 percent with 40 per cent for the cognitive therapy group. Further follow up showed sustained improvement with the medicine-treated group in the Vanderbilt University location. The U of P groups remained about equal.

In conclusion, the report stated, “Cognitive therapy can be as effective as medications for the initial treatment of moderate to severe major depression, but this degree of effectiveness may depend on a high level of therapist experience or expertise.”

♡❤♡NORWAY; Kristiansand:♡❤♡ In the weekend between the 11. and 13. of March the Norwegian Centre Party held its annual National Conference in Kristiansand. The conference was clearly inspired by the prospects of a majority in the parliament together with the Norwegian Socialist Left- and Labour Party, according to all polls.

In this conference the leader, Åslaug Haga, was re-elected against one vote and to great applaus from the 187 other voters. 

♡❤♡Compromise on oil drilling in the Barents Sea♡❤♡ &lt;br&gt;
The matter of greatest anticipation before the convention was a question if the environmentalist Centre Party would open for oil drilling in the Barents Sea. The Centre Youth had clearly announced its opposition to the suggestion at an earlier point. 

After a long debate with both very young and very old committed debaters the coalition of the hardest environmentalists, the leader and the Centre Youth surprisingly lost the voting. The Centre Party opened for a compromise proposed by one of the two second leaders, Lars Peder Brekk, on accepting oil drilling with untraditionally strong demands for environmental safety.

♡❤♡Focus on decentralization♡❤♡ &lt;br&gt;
The leader, Åslaug Haga, and most of the debaters in the conference made it clear that the Centre Party was sharpening it decentralization-knives. In the conference Haga was joined by several other active members in underlining the Centre Partys role as the most dedicated decentralizationing-party in Norway.

It was clear from the debaters that the main role of the party in a possibly upcoming majority-government (majority in parliament) with the Labour and Socialist Left Party mainly was to make the government focus on turning around the sentralization of Norway and to hinder the Labour Party and the Conservative Party from cooperating on sending a new application for membership in the European Union.

♡❤♡NORWAY, Kristiansand:♡❤♡ This weekend (1. - 3. April) the Norwegian Socialist Left Party held its 16. ordinary National Conference. The conference was characterized by the members and speakers obvious belief in themselves winning the upcoming election together with the Norwegian Labour Party and the Norwegian Centre Party. This partly unofficial alliance has lately been leading all polls with the rarity of a majority of the members of parliament ("Stortinget"). Norway has not seen a government with a majority in the parliament since shortly after WWII, when the Labour Party governed.

♡❤♡New gas powerplants in Norway♡❤♡ &lt;br&gt;
In a resolution from the conference the Socialist Left Party opens for the building of new gas powerplants in Norway, as long as these powerplants do not release any CO2 into the atmosphere. 

This has been a matter of great discussion in Norway and prime ministers have given away their chairs in the dispute. In the latter the Centre Party also made a similar resolution, and so it seems the upcoming government will open for the building of these plants.

♡❤♡Agains membership in the European Union♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;
The Socialist Left Party is still clearly opposed to Norway entering the European Union (with only five votes for membership). 

As both Socialist Left Party and the Centre Party are clear non-unionist parties, it seems they will block the Labour Party from sending any applications for membership in the upcoming four-year government period. 

♡❤♡More abortion and status quo on prostitution♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;
The Socialist Left Party wants to expand the time limit for abortion to 16 weeks after impregnation.

The Socialist Left Party does ♡❤not♡❤ want to criminalize the act of buying services from prostitutes. 

There was a great deal of discussion surrounding the subject of prostitution. As the Socialist Left Party has a large group of feminists among its active members, there was a great minority voting ♡❤for♡❤ criminalization.

♡❤♡April 6, 2005♡❤♡ 
The &lt;a href="w%3ADetroit%20Tigers"&gt;Detroit Tigers&lt;/a&gt; began their 2005 season in style on April 4, defeating the &lt;a href="w%3AKansas%20City%20Royals"&gt;Kansas City Royals&lt;/a&gt; 11-2 in their home opener of the &lt;a href="w%3AMajor%20League%20Baseball"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; season. The game, played in front of a record crowd of 44,105 at Detroit's &lt;a href="w%3AComerica%20Park"&gt;Comerica Park&lt;/a&gt;, was an offensive showcase for the Tigers, led by &lt;a href="w%3ADmitri%20Young"&gt;Dmitri Young&lt;/a&gt;, who went 4-for-4, matching a career-high 5 RBIs. Three of Young's four hits were home runs, making Young only the third baseball player in history to hit three home runs in a season opener. The previous two players to accomplish that feat are &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Bell"&gt;George Bell&lt;/a&gt;, who hit three home runs for the &lt;a href="w%3AToronto%20Blue%20Jays"&gt;Toronto Blue Jays&lt;/a&gt; against the Royals on opening day, 1988; and &lt;a href="w%3ATuffy%20Rhodes"&gt;Tuffy Rhodes&lt;/a&gt;, who hit three home runs for the &lt;a href="w%3AChicago%20Cubs"&gt;Chicago Cubs&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Mets"&gt;New York Mets&lt;/a&gt; in 1994.
Tigers starter &lt;a href="w%3AJeremy%20Bonderman"&gt;Jeremy Bonderman&lt;/a&gt; was the winning pitcher, the youngest starter to win an opening day game since 1986.

Tens of thousands of regular people walked through the domed St. Peter's Basilica today, but the queue behind them never seemed to ebb, according to reporters in The Vatican.

Winding over two miles from the bier holding the Pontiff's body all the way to the Tiber River, backpackers from all over the world, young and old, students and the disabled, waited and slowly shuffled toward their goal: one last look at the pope they had come to feel was like a father to them.

A French park ranger spoke of the physical pain the pope must have suffered while remaining so peaceful in spirit. Another visitor was hoping to kiss his hand or touch his robe. They were satisfied with merely a chance to view his crimson-robed body, as visible in death as he had been only weeks earlier, in life.

Nearly 2 million people will visit The Vatican for the funeral service on Friday, an unprecedented salute for a public figure who may have helped bring down the Iron Curtain.

Other voices were heard as well, but they were in dissent. Amidst Pope Paul’s uncompromising orthodoxy, they said, he had destroyed democracy in the Church and alienated many. And although most of the mourners were contrite and moved slowly through the long queue, there were the usual “line jumpers,” greeted by catcalls and impatient reactions from others.

“Filthy pigs! We’ll all be dead by the time we get in,” an elderly woman spat in Italian.

The city of Rome, which surrounds Vatican City, has set up campgrounds in stadiums and public places for open use during the events. One lady said she didn’t care where she slept or even if she would.

Sabina La Versa had taken the all-night train from Sicily to view the pontiff. She said “The pope’s love for us flowed like water from a jug. I’d wait here forever to say arrivederci,” Italian for “see you again.”

The Baseball officials and the players' union have both decided to not disclose the specific substance which tested positive.

Sanchez originally planed an appeal against the ban, but decided against it. He denies taking any performance enhancing drugs and blames the positive test on over-the-counter vitamins, muscle relaxants and protein shakes that he takes, but has not identified any specific medications as of yet.

<h1>Bomb explodes on historic Kashmir bus route</h1>
♡❤♡April 6, 2005♡❤♡ 

A bomb, injuring three people, exploded on a new bus service route 
between the Indian and Pakistani sides of the &lt;a href="w%3AKashmir"&gt;Kashmir&lt;/a&gt; border. Two other bombs on the route were found and defused. A replacement bus is scheduled for an inaugural run this Thursday.

Threats of violence against passengers, and attacks on the bus on the
inaugural trip, were issued by Muslim militants.

The bombs were found on a section of highway between Srinigar, in Indian-controlled
Kashmir, and Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistani-controlled Kashmir. The defused explosives weighed more than 60 kilograms each.

No civilians have traveled this route since 1947, when
&lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; won independence from
Britain. The Kashmir territory has been under dispute by India and
Pakistan since that time, with China joining the dispute in 1962 when
it took control of a region along the eastern border.

The bus link is seen as a major step toward healing the hostilities
between India and Pakistan by allowing families, separated for decades
during the dispute, to re-unite.

Since 1989, a handful of Islamic militant groups have fought for
Kashmir to become independent or to merge with predominantly Muslim
Pakistan. With the bus route opening coming on the top of
other so-called "confidence-building" moves between Pakistan and
India, the militants apparently feel their movement is under threat.

Bharat Karnad, an analyst with New Delhi think-tank Center for Policy
Research, stated: "Once people get their free access and they can
freely move from one territory to another, meet the families and so
on, the great incentive and motivation is gone to risk their lives to
fight for some notion of jihad that some groups may propound."

Most of the 24 passengers expected to take the maiden voyage,
officials say, are in protective custody because of threats made by
some of the militant groups against them and their families.

<h1>Harvard University divests $4.4m of PetroChina stock</h1>
♡❤♡April 6, 2005♡❤♡

In response to pressure from students and faculty, Harvard University announced on April 4 that it would sell its shares of PetroChina stock, the Harvard Crimson reported. The Crimson noted that the University held 67,200 shares of PetroChina in December of 2004. At present prices, the stock would be worth approximately $4.4 million, said the paper. The precise details of Harvard's holdings in PetroChina were not specified in the University's statement; it stated simply that it would direct the Harvard Management Company to "divest its holdings of PetroChina stock."

PetroChina is a subsidiary of China National Petroleum Company, which invested $1bn in what the Crimson called a "joint venture" with the government of Sudan to develop the nation's oil infrastructure. The company was characterized as playing a "leading role . . . in the Sudanese oil industry, which is so important to the Sudanese regime" by Harvard president Lawrence Summers, said the Globe.

According to the Boston Globe, Harvard's divestment is particularly significant because Harvard "never fully divested itself from companies doing business with apartheid South Africa, unlike many other major universities."

The divestment occurred after a petition started by two Harvard juniors, Ben Collins and Manav Bhatnagar, circulated at the University, receiving signatures from more than 80 faculty members and hundreds of students.

<h1>NASA's Mars rovers exceed all expectations</h1>
♡❤♡April 6, 2005♡❤♡ 
With the approval of an additional 18 months of funding, NASA's twin Mars rovers, the Spirit and Opportunity, will continue their exploration of "fantastic" landscapes for an additional 14 months.
"The rovers have proven their value with major discoveries about ancient watery environments on Mars that might have harbored life," said Dr. Ghassem Asrar, deputy associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate. "We are extending their mission through September 2006 to take advantage of having such capable resources still healthy and in excellent position to continue their adventures."

With 11 months of extensions exceeding their successful three-month prime missions, "We now have to make long-term plans for the vehicles because they may be around for quite a while," said Jim Erickson, rover project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. 

Scientists are within a few football field’s distance of a region called “Etched Terrain,” with rocks exposed by actual wind erosion rather than craters. There are rocks different from others in any other time in Mars’ history. "This is a journey into the unknown, to something completely new," said Dr. Steve Squyres of Cornell University, Ithaca, N.Y., and principal investigator for the rover's science instruments.

The rover Opportunity has overtaken Spirit in total distance driven. It has been pushed by rover planners to roll more than three miles—eight times the original goal.

On March 20, a new Martian record of 722 feet in a single 24-hour drive was accomplished by Opportunity. Even Spirit is exceeding expectations although it is in much rougher terrain, climbing a rocky slope toward an area called “Husband Hill.”

The rovers have shown signs of wear and tear. Spirit’s rock abrasion tool grinding teeth might be nearly useless after exposing the interior of five times more rocks than its original design goal of only three rocks.

<h1>51 suspects named by UN for war crimes in Darfur</h1>
♡❤♡April 6, 2005♡❤♡ 
The &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASudan"&gt;Sudanese Government&lt;/a&gt; said it will not hand over 51 suspects named by the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="w%3Awar%20crimes"&gt;war crimes&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ADarfur"&gt;Darfur region&lt;/a&gt;.

The sealed list, presented to the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AInternational%20Criminal%20Court"&gt;International Criminal Court&lt;/a&gt; (ICC) on Tuesday, was drawn up following an investigation by the UN into claims of killings, torture and rape committed by Government forces and militias in the Darfur region. Sudanese President &lt;a href="w%3AOmar%20Hasan%20Ahmad%20al-Bashir"&gt;Omar al-Bashir&lt;/a&gt;, backed by huge protests against the UN in Sudan's capital of &lt;a href="w%3AKhartoum"&gt;Khartoum&lt;/a&gt;, snubbed the UN resolution which was passed last week to bring suspects to trial before the court. Omar al-Bashir explained that he "shall never hand any Sudanese national to a foreign court". &lt;a href="http%3A//english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/EC6990D4-FD6D-47C9-B9E6-139A5B1C0F97.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

ICC's chief prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo said, "Now, we have a common task to end the culture of impunity," upon receiving the list of suspects at the UN headquarters in New York. He continued: "I will closely monitor ongoing crimes in Darfur as well as efforts to prevent and stop them". The Darfur case is expected to demonstrate the effectiveness of the ICC, whose purpose is to try alleged genocide, war crimes and mass human rights violations criminals.

As the ICC, based in the Hague, received thousands of pages of evidence collected by UN investigators, Sudanese protesters descended upon the gates of the UN compound in Khartoum, fiercely criticising the UN's involvement in the Darfur conflict. &lt;a href="http%3A//news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-04/06/content_2791390.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

"We are coming here to say to America 'no' to these orders. We are not people who have to listen to orders from anybody except the Sudan," one demonstrator told the BBC. Stating that it will prosecute suspects itself, Sudan's government earlier described the UN's decision to try individuals allegedly linked to the atrocities committed in Darfur as "unfair, ill-advised and narrow-minded". &lt;a href="http%3A//news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4411497.stm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The UN has since said it hoped the Sudanese Government would cooperate before indictments and arrest warrants are issued, and the UN understood that Sudanese rebels will surrender to the court if they are indicted. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml%3Ftype%3DworldNews%26amp%3BstoryID%3D8093451"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

According to the UN, at least 180,000 people have died and more than two million have fled the region since the conflict between black African rebels and Arab militia began two years ago.

&lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; – 
Brazil's capital city of &lt;a href="w%3ABrasilia"&gt;Brasilia&lt;/a&gt; is scheduled to host the Summit of &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20America"&gt;South American&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AArab"&gt;Arab&lt;/a&gt; Countries from May 10 to the 11th, according to the Brazilian Ministry of External Relations. The organizers say that South American and Arab Countries will discuss political, commercial, cultural, and scientific and technological cooperation.

The summit was proposed by Brazilian President &lt;a href="w%3ALuiz%20In%C3%A1cio%20Lula%20da%20Silva"&gt;Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva&lt;/a&gt; during his visit to several Arab countries in December, 2004. This was the first time some of the countries visited by Lula had entered into contact with a Brazilian ruler since 1876 with then Brazilian Emperor, Dom Pedro II.

During a visit to the headquarters of the &lt;a href="w%3AArab%20League"&gt;Arab League&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href="w%3ACairo"&gt;Cairo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AEgypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;, Lula da Silva proposed the creation of a Summit of South American and Arab Countries. "The summit aims the creation of a new world where the Third World countries can have a new role", Lula added.

The countries scheduled to meet next month are:

Correspondent Toby Harnden and photographer Julian Simmonds of ♡❤The Sunday Telegraph♡❤ weekly, were put on trial for violating Zimbabwe's "Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act". The act requires all journalists in Zimbabwe to obtain accreditation from the state media commission. The two are also accused of breaking immigration laws by overstaying their visas.

The journalists were arrested last Thursday during the election that saw victory for President Robert Mugabe's ZANU-PF. The trial is being held in a small town 40 kilometers north of &lt;a href="w%3AHarare"&gt;Harare&lt;/a&gt;, capital of &lt;a href="Zimbabwe"&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt;. Despite being granted bail, the pair are spending a fifth night behind bars in Harare. Although they face two years in jail, it is believed they will instead be fined and deported.

"The accused persons had no right to cover the elections because they had no accreditation and had no right to stay in the country beyond March 28," State prosecutor Albert Masama said in court statements.

The prosecutor said the two flew into Harare and met unnamed members of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change. Simmonds was arrested after he was seen taking photographs of a line of voters at a polling station.

Defence lawyer Beatrice Mtetwa, said the men had valid visas and believed they were in Zimbabwe legally when they were arrested. She said the two were tourists and visited such resorts as the Victoria Falls.

More than 200 journalists were accredited to cover last week's elections, but many more had their applications rejected.

After a blowout win for the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Yankees"&gt;New York Yankees&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday, their ancient rivalry with the 2004 &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Series"&gt;World Series&lt;/a&gt; champion &lt;a href="w%3ABoston%20Red%20Sox"&gt;Boston Red Sox&lt;/a&gt; resumed with a close game on Tuesday that went down to the wire. Yankees closer &lt;a href="w%3AMariano%20Rivera"&gt;Mariano Rivera&lt;/a&gt; had a &lt;a href="w%3Ablown%20save"&gt;blown save&lt;/a&gt; in the top of the ninth when he surrendered a solo home run to Red Sox catcher &lt;a href="w%3AJason%20Varitek"&gt;Jason Varitek&lt;/a&gt; that tied the score at 3-3. Yankee &lt;a href="w%3ADerek%20Jeter"&gt;Derek Jeter&lt;/a&gt; saved the day in his lead-off at bat in the bottom of the ninth, hitting a &lt;a href="w%3Awalk-off%20home%20run"&gt;walk-off home run&lt;/a&gt; off &lt;a href="w%3AKeith%20Foulke"&gt;Keith Foulke&lt;/a&gt; to win the game for the Yankees. Yankees manager &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Torre"&gt;Joe Torre&lt;/a&gt; said, "We escaped today. Mariano is still the best in the game as far as I'm concerned. That doesn't mean that clubs aren't going to get to him once in a while. These guys we're playing are the world champs."

Rivera and the Yankees won't soon forget the glory snatched from them by the Red Sox in last year's &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20League%20Championship%20Series"&gt;American League Championship Series&lt;/a&gt;. The Red Sox were within three outs of being defeated in a sweep when they rallied against Mariano Rivera at Fenway Park in Game 4. They went on to win in 12 innings, and won the next three games to take the Series, and went on to win the World Series.

Other spotlights included starting pitcher &lt;a href="w%3ACarl%20Pavano"&gt;Carl Pavano&lt;/a&gt;'s debut for the Yankees and &lt;a href="w%3AHideki%20Matsui"&gt;Hideki Matsui&lt;/a&gt;, who hit his second home run in two games.

Today's game was played in front of 54,690 at &lt;a href="w%3AYankee%20Stadium"&gt;Yankee Stadium&lt;/a&gt;.

Becky Zerlentes, 34, died on Sunday, April 3 in what was to be her last boxing match before retirement. The match, a Colorado State Golden Gloves bout, was held in Denver on April 2. Her opponent for the senior women's title in that match was Heather Schmitz, 32.

Zerlentes received a knockout punch in the third round by a straight blow to her left temple. She received immediate attention from ringside physicians, but never regained consciousness, even after being admitted to Denver General Hospital for emergency surgery on Saturday night. She expired on Sunday due to blunt-force trauma injuries received to the head, resulting in a blood clot on the brain.

Her opponent Heather Schmitz met with reporters and expressed her regret, saying, "I didn't want to hurt her. I feel very bad about that."

"Nobody thought it was a very hard blow," said Jeanne DePriest, manager of Zerlentes' team. "We've been talking to people all day trying to find out what happened." Zerlentes was wearing her required protective headgear at the time of the accident.

Several commentators have remarked on the coincidental similarities between Zerlentes' death and the events depicted in the recent Oscar-winning film, Million Dollar Baby, in which a character becomes quadriplegic as a result of a spinal cord injury suffered during her last fight.

&lt;a href="http%3A//www.usaboxing.org/"&gt;USA Boxing&lt;/a&gt; oversees the sport of amateur, Olympic-style boxing in America, as a member organization of the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.aiba.net/"&gt;International Amateur Boxing Association&lt;/a&gt; (AIBA). The non-profit organization has overseen men's amateur boxing since 1888, but has only admitted women to the sport since 1993. There are currently 2,200 registered women boxers, according to USA Boxing, and interest in the sport is increasing.

"The USA Boxing family's thoughts and prayers go out to Becky's family and husband. We are deeply saddened by this loss," said Sandy Martinez-Pino, president of USA Boxing.

In the aftermath of Zerlentes' tragic death, the USA Boxing authorities have continued to affirm their high level of safety precautions and close oversight of the sport's conditions and equipment. According to their website, amateur boxing was ranked 23rd in rate of injuries, behind soccer and gymnastics (National Safety Council, 1996) and 8th in rate of sports-related fatalities, behind football and scuba diving (Boxing and Medicine, Human Kinetics Illinois, 1995).

Zerlentes had an amateur record of 6-4 (6 wins to 4 losses), and was a former regional boxing champion with several brown belts in martial arts. She had a &lt;a href="http%3A//au.frcc.cccoes.edu/~beckyz/cv.htm"&gt;PhD in Geography&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign and was an Adjunct Instructor in geography at &lt;a href="http%3A//frontrange.edu/"&gt;Front Range Community College&lt;/a&gt; in Colorado. She is survived by a husband and family.

&lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20America"&gt;North American&lt;/a&gt; travelers will see a phased-in requirement to carry &lt;a href="w%3APassport"&gt;passports&lt;/a&gt; in the coming years. In a multi-national initiative to restrict illegal immigration and travel, a passport layer of stricter identification will be introduced for travel throughout the continent by the year 2008. The US State Department announced the new American travel rules Monday. 

For the most part, North American citizens can now travel to neighboring countries without formal papers. But starting in December 2005, U.S. citizens travelling by air or sea to or from the Caribbean, Central and South America will need a passport to get back into their native nation. Showing a driver's license or a government-issued photo ID card will no longer be sufficient for making the border crossing back.

&lt;a href="w%3ACondoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; said that passport restrictions will help keep out "people who want to hurt us." 

Rice made a brief trip on March 10 to meet with &lt;a href="w%3AVicente%20Fox"&gt;Mexican President Vicente Fox&lt;/a&gt; before leaving on her Far East tour. The Mexican meeting was to pave the way for a March 23 summit with &lt;a href="Paul%20Martin"&gt;Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin&lt;/a&gt; and Fox at the President Bush ranch in Texas. Issues concerning immigration, border security and water rights were discussed at the meeting. The intent of the summit was to produce a North American initiative that will strengthen security and economic ties.

The passport rules are a result of that summit.

The next phase of the passport requirements begins Dec 2006, when passports for air and sea travel to, or from Mexico and Canada, the Caribbean, Bermuda and US will be required. The final phase involves any travel: whether air, sea or land crossings, passports will be required at borders by Dec 7, 2008.

A survey of 251 North American companies revealed that less than 10% of their computers have &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AWindows%20XP"&gt;Windows XP&lt;/a&gt; Service Pack 2 installed. The results of the study, conducted by AssetMetrix, were released this week after 136,000 PCs running &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft's&lt;/a&gt; Windows operating system were examined. Although many of the companies in the poll are still using earlier releases of Windows, such as Windows 2000 and Windows 98, only 24% of businesses using Windows XP had successfully rolled out SP2.

Released in September 2004, SP2 includes security improvements for the Windows XP operating system, including an enhanced &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AFirewall%20%28networking%29"&gt;firewall&lt;/a&gt; and a pop-up ad blocker for &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AInternet%20Explorer"&gt;Internet Explorer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.theregister.co.uk/2004/03/24/ms_bigs_up_windows_xp/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; When it was first made available, businesses could opt to postpone installation of the service pack so that their respective IT departments could prepare for the update. However on April 12, Microsoft will force users to upgrade to SP2 via their automatic Windows Update system, which delivers software over the Internet. AssetMetrix believe this move will catch out unprepared companies.

"Microsoft allowed a significant period of time to accommodate companies' demand to test and validate Windows XP SP2 within their IT infrastructure," explained AssetMetrix Research Labs' managing director Steve O'Halloran.

He added: "Based on our research, a substantial number of companies have yet to decide whether to accept or embargo Windows XP SP2. To date, we have observed that 40 percent of companies using Windows XP have actively avoided upgrading to SP2, and only 7 percent have actively accepted it. The other 52 percent of the companies showed no direction or policy towards SP2, and may find themselves having support issues by allowing multiple editions of Windows XP to exist in their infrastructure."

Translated from report by: Zhang Yongtai (Voice of America/ Taipei)

♡❤In order to remember the passing away of Taiwan's former leader, the opposition parties of the &lt;a href="w%3APan-Blue%20Coalition"&gt;Pan Blue Camp&lt;/a&gt; used the &lt;a href="w%3AQingming%20Festival"&gt;Tomb Sweeping Day&lt;/a&gt; holiday to visit Chiang’s tomb and pay respects. However the &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Progressive%20Party"&gt;Democratic Progressive Party&lt;/a&gt; government did not hold any similar activities.♡❤

The chairs of Taiwan’s opposition parties, the &lt;a href="w%3AKuomintang"&gt;Kuomintang&lt;/a&gt; (KMT), &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Party%20%28Taiwan%29"&gt;New Party&lt;/a&gt; (NP) and &lt;a href="w%3APeople%20First%20Party"&gt;People First Party&lt;/a&gt; (PFP) used the Tomb Sweeping Day break to lead trips to the Taoyuan county &lt;a href="w%3ATzuhu"&gt;Tzuhu&lt;/a&gt; and Touliao mausoleums (resting spots of &lt;a href="w%3AChiang%20Kai-shek"&gt;Chiang Kai-shek&lt;/a&gt; and his son &lt;a href="w%3AChiang%20Ching-kuo"&gt;Chiang Ching-kuo&lt;/a&gt; respectably.) Because the bodies of Chiang Kai-shek and Chiang Ching-kuo are planned to be moved to Wutzushan military cemetery in Taipei County in August of this year, the opportunity to visit the tombs of the two former leaders is almost gone.

♡❤♡Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) pays no visits to Chiang’s tomb♡❤♡

During the rule of the Kuomintang government, visiting the tombs was a major event, presidents lead the chiefs of the five branches of the government in a memorial at the tombs. Though following Taiwan's gradual shift towards democracy the visits to the tombs have become more and more simple and forlorn. After the Kuomintang lost control of the government the event even became an activity only for the Pan Blues; the DPP government not only didn’t visit the tombs, they didn’t even hold similar ceremonies.

♡❤♡Lien Chan: “would be pleased to visit the mainland”♡❤♡

Because KMT Vice Chairman &lt;a href="w%3AChiang%20Pin-kun"&gt;Chiang Pin-kun&lt;/a&gt;’s recent visit to mainland China caused such mixed reactions in the political arena, the question of when KMT Chair Lien Chan would visit the Chinese mainland was also a hot topic. After paying his respects Lien expressed that he was honored by the invitation to visit the mainland, but a time frame for the visit is still awaiting further confirmation: "I would be pleased to accept such of visit, and go on a 'journey of peace, the time (of the trip) should be in the near future, as for how to determine the time for certain, it will require contact from both sides to decide."

♡❤♡James Soong: don’t rush♡❤♡

As for the People First Party chair &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Soong"&gt;James Soong&lt;/a&gt;, who in the month of February held talks with President &lt;a href="w%3AChen%20Shui-bian"&gt;Chen Shui-bian&lt;/a&gt; in the so-called “Chen-Soong meeting”, appeared conservative in answering questions about himself visiting China: “Which party wants to rush to go first, the PFP wont do like others did and try to go against the policy, today we hope to place policy before politics.”

Soong also said that the relationship between Taiwan and mainland China is very complex, and the KMT and DPP both can’t solve the problem within fifty years or five years. The PFP hopes that both sides of the Taiwan Strait can benefit; he said he believes that a relationship between the two sides is not a one-sided wish, and hopes it can take place in an atmosphere in which both sides desire not to encroach on the dignity of Taiwan. Soong also stated that he will soon be able to meet with Chen Shui-bian and Lien Chan to discuss the Taiwan Strait situation.

♡❤♡John Chiang: tombs should become a “tomb containing clothing without the body,”♡❤♡

Also worth mentioning is the discussion about what will be done with the mausoleums of the two Chiangs once their bodies are moved to Wutzushan military cemetery. &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Chiang"&gt;John Chiang&lt;/a&gt;, Chiang Ching-kuo’s illegitimate son, said that he hopes the Taoyuan County government will be able to maintain the original spirit and cultural spirit of the mausoleums. He also suggested that once the bodies are moved, the tombs become a “tomb containing clothing without the body,” and hopes the places will remain open to the public so they can remember the ways of their predecessors.

A landmark study comparing effectiveness in reducing major depression of two forms of initial treatment &amp;mdash; &lt;a href="w%3Acognitive%20therapy"&gt;cognitive therapy&lt;/a&gt; which involves discussing thought processes with a qualified &lt;a href="w%3Acounselor"&gt;counselor&lt;/a&gt;, vs &lt;a href="w%3APsychopharmacology"&gt;medication&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; has revealed that both forms of therapy reduce depression, but that the benefits of cognitive therapy last longer than those of medication. The study finding contradicts current treatment guidelines of the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Psychiatric%20Association"&gt;American Psychiatric Association (APA)&lt;/a&gt;.

The 16-week study, by researchers at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Pennsylvania"&gt;University of Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AVanderbilt%20University"&gt;Vanderbilt University&lt;/a&gt;, was the largest trial yet undertaken to resolve the years-old debate. Two-hundred-and-forty patients with moderate-to-severe depression were given one or other of the treatments, or a purposely-ineffective placebo. Study representatives described the two treatments about equally effective &amp;mdash; both much more effective than the placebo &amp;mdash; but with the positive effect of talk-therapy lasting longer.

In fact, the cognitive therapy group saw only as many relapses as a another group that had continued to receive drug therapy.

"We believe that cognitive therapy might have more lasting effects because it equips patients with the tools they need to learn how to manage their problems and emotions," said Robert DeRubeis, professor and chair of Penn's &lt;a href="http%3A//www.psych.upenn.edu/"&gt;Department of Psychology&lt;/a&gt;. "Pharmaceuticals, while effective, offer no long term cure for the symptoms of depression. For many people, cognitive therapy might prove to be the preferred form of treatment."

"Medication is often an appropriate treatment, but drugs have drawbacks, such as &lt;a href="w%3AAdverse%20effect%20%28medicine%29"&gt;side effects&lt;/a&gt; or a diminished &lt;a href="w%3AEfficacy"&gt;efficacy&lt;/a&gt; over time," DeRubeis said. "Patients with depression are often overwhelmed by other factors in their life that pills simply cannot solve. In many cases, cognitive therapy succeeds because it teaches the skills that help people cope."

Researchers pointed out that while the effectiveness of cognitive therapy depended largely on the experience of the practitioner, the same was true of medication, due to the judgement required in prescribing correct dosages of drugs.

<h1>ABC to move Internet news network back to U.S. TVs</h1>
♡❤♡April 6, 2005♡❤♡

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; television network &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Broadcasting%20Company"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt; says its 24-hour news network, &lt;a href="w%3AABC%20News%20Now"&gt;♡❤ABC News Now♡❤&lt;/a&gt;, will become a permanent 24-hour television news network starting in July. Currently, the operation is only available on the Internet as a &lt;a href="w%3Astreaming%20media"&gt;streaming media&lt;/a&gt; web site.

The network started as a experiment by the &lt;a href="w%3AWalt%20Disney%20Company"&gt;Walt Disney Company&lt;/a&gt;-owned ABC in the summer of 2004 during the U.S. presidential campaign nomination conventions. It was mostly broadcast as a subchannel or shared channel within the bandwidth of an existing &lt;a href="w%3Adigital%20television"&gt;digital television&lt;/a&gt; (DTV) channel already owned by ABC. For instance if the local ABC affiliate is on Channel 7 with a DTV channel of 23, then ♡❤ABC News Now♡❤ may have been available on digital channel 23.1, sharing the same bandwidth.

Because few households in the U.S. are equipped to tune in digital over-the-air sub-channels, and virtually none are carried on local cable companies, ratings were low for the fledgling digital channel. Adding to that technical difficulty, cable carriage of the network was small. ♡❤ABC News Now♡❤ was delivered to only 6 of the 110 million U.S. households via cable. Most viewers of the network, 30 million at last count, watched the network via the Internet.

Citing money reasons, ABC shuttered the over-the-air ♡❤ABC News Now♡❤ broadcasts in January to focus on building the web-based service. But come July, ABC plans to return its news network and its 20 original programs to local TV stations. Without any commitment from national cable or satellite companies, ABC will return to digital sub-channels on local DTV transmissions.

<h1>Nigeria destroys illegal small arms</h1>
♡❤♡April 6, 2005♡❤♡ 

&lt;p&gt;
Nigeria is cracking down illegal firearms, the Xinhua news agency reports.
&lt;p&gt;
So far this week the Nigerian government has destroyed 2,738 small arms and 5,368 rounds of ammunition, primarily in the troubled Niger Delta region.
&lt;p&gt;
The government began a project last October to rid the country of illegal arms and Tuesday's news will bring the total weapons seized and destroyed to 4,678 along with 8,256 rounds of ammunition.
&lt;p&gt;
Nigerian Defence Minister Rabiu Kwankwaso told local Nigerian newspaper Vanguard, this was "the highest single destruction ever". He added: "The war against the proliferation of illegal arms and ammunition is being won by the government."
&lt;p&gt;
The government will continue to "recover and destroy illegally acquired arms in order to engender a peaceful and secured environment for socio-political, economic and cultural development," Kwankwaso continued. 
&lt;p&gt;
The Niger Delta holds most of the country's oil reserves, which makes Nigeria the eighth largest producer in the world. Fighting in the region claims over 1,000 lives a year.
&lt;p&gt;
Residents of the Niger Delta have been fighting armed campaigns against oil companies that have begun oil production in the area. They claim that they have been inadequately compensated, that the land and water are being polluted, and that the Nigerian police and military have been acting in collusion with the oil producers to attack local villages, and torture and execute campaigners.

<h1>U.S. Baseball: Delgado starts off well with Marlins</h1>
♡❤♡April 7, 2005♡❤♡

&lt;a href="w%3ACarlos%20Delgado"&gt;Carlos Delgado&lt;/a&gt; was impressive in his National League debut with the &lt;a href="w%3AFlorida%20Marlins"&gt;Florida Marlins&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday after getting off to a slow start. In the first inning, the Marlins scored five runs off &lt;a href="w%3AAtlanta%20Braves"&gt;Atlanta Braves&lt;/a&gt; starting pitcher &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Smoltz"&gt;John Smoltz&lt;/a&gt;, while Delgado struck out on three pitches. Delgado made up for this disappointment by following it with four straight hits, hitting four-for-five with three &lt;a href="w%3ARBI"&gt;RBI&lt;/a&gt;s ♡❤en route♡❤ to a 9-0 victory.

Before the start of the season, there was some concern about how the change from American to National League would affect the slugger's performance. Delgado spent the past thirteen seasons with the &lt;a href="w%3AToronto%20Blue%20Jays"&gt;Toronto Blue Jays&lt;/a&gt; before signing a four-year, $52 million contract with the Marlins. Marlins manager Jack McKeon said, wryly, "Many of the writers asked during spring training if his change of leagues was going to be a factor. In the first inning, it was." Delgado has certainly made an impact on the Marlins organization, and there is a lot of excitement in &lt;a href="w%3AMiami%2C%20Florida"&gt;Miami&lt;/a&gt; over his new arrival. Opening day attendance was a record sell-out at &lt;a href="w%3ADolphins%20Stadium"&gt;Dolphins Stadium&lt;/a&gt; of 57,405, and spirits are high as the Marlins are one of the favourites to win the National League East, thanks in no small part to Delgado's presence. But, the baseball season is a long road to travel; as Delgado said, "Obviously, we have good talent here. We've got to go out and play. Because we've got such and such, and we picked up this guy, that doesn't mean anything. You've got to go out and do it on the field. Yeah, it was a great game. But it's over now."

Today's game was played in front of 57,405 at Dolphins Stadium.

<h1>Toronto transit union threatens strike for Monday</h1>
♡❤♡April 6, 2005♡❤♡ 

Bob Kinnear, president of &lt;a href="w%3AAmalgamated%20Transit%20Union"&gt;Amalgamated Transit Union&lt;/a&gt; Local 113, said today that &lt;a href="w%3AToronto"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AOntario"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATransit%20%28transportation%29"&gt;transit&lt;/a&gt; workers may begin &lt;a href="w%3AStrike%20action"&gt;striking&lt;/a&gt; as early as this Monday. A strike of the 8 400 employees would leave approximately 1.3 million daily riders looking for other means of transportation and clogging city roads.

The union voted down the &lt;a href="w%3AToronto%20Transit%20Commission"&gt;Toronto Transit Commission&lt;/a&gt;'s (TTC) offer March 9 with a 99% vote in favour of a strike. The five-year offer was said to include a two per cent wage increase in each of the next three years. The union said it wanted increased &lt;a href="w%3Apension"&gt;pension&lt;/a&gt; contributions and more leniency in scheduling. The union has now been in a legal strike position since April 1 but has said it would withhold strike action as long as serious negotiations were taking place. Today ♡❤Canadian Press♡❤ reported that TTC vice-chairman Joe Mihevic said the two sides were in "heavy, heavy" negotiations but going well and hoped they would continue.

Mr. Kinnear, however, announced a noon Friday deadline for a contract and told reporters that he feels the commission has been "dragging their heels on issues that they absolutely know are key to a settlement". He characterized the commission's negotiations as a "strategy of delay, defer and ignore".

The most recent TTC strike was in 1999 and jammed city roads for two days before the provincial government ordered the union back to work.

<h1>Swift mission measures distance to star explosions</h1>
♡❤♡April 6, 2005♡❤♡
In another first for the NASA-led space telescope mission called
Swift, five months into its mission it measured the distance to two
gamma-ray bursts (GRB), back to back, from opposite parts of the sky.
The GRB's are over nine billion light years away from the Earth.

The measurements were obtained utilizing the Ultraviolet/Optical
Telescope (UVOT).

"Swift will detect more gamma-ray bursts than any satellite that has
come before it, and now will be able to pin down distances to many of
these bursts too," said Peter Roming, UVOT Lead Scientist at Penn
State. "These two aren't distance record-breakers, but they're
certainly from far out there. The second of the two bursts was bright
enough to be seen from Earth with a good backyard telescope."

The Swift science team said these types of distance measurements
will become routine, allowing scientists to create a map to understand
where, when and how these brilliant, fleeting bursts of light are
created.

&lt;a href="w%3AGamma%20ray%20burst"&gt;Gamma-ray bursts&lt;/a&gt;, the most powerful
explosions known in the Universe, are thought to signal the birth of
black holes; either from a massive star explosion or a merger of
smaller black holes or &lt;a href="w%3ANeutron%20star"&gt;neutron stars&lt;/a&gt;. Several
appear each day from Earth's vantage point. They are difficult to
detect and study because they occur randomly from any point in the sky
and last only a few milliseconds to about a minute.

Swift, with three telescopes, is designed to detect bursts and turn on
its own to focus its telescopes, within seconds, on the burst
afterglow, which can linger for hours to weeks. The UVOT is a joint
product of Penn State University and the Mullard Space Science Laboratory in
England.

Swift detected the bursts on March 18 and 19, as indicted in their
names: GRB 050318 and GRB 050319. The UVOT team estimated that the
redshifts are 1.44 and 3.24, respectively, which corresponds to
distances of about 9.2 billion and 11.6 billion light years. (The
second estimate reflects a more precise measurement made with the
ground-based &lt;a href="w%3ANordic%20Optical%20Telescope"&gt;Nordic Optical Telescope&lt;/a&gt;.)
Distance measurements are attained through analysis of the burst
afterglow.

Swift detected 24 bursts so far. GRB 050318 was the first burst
where the UVOT detected an afterglow. The lack of afterglow detection
is interesting in its own right, Roming said, because it helps
scientists understand why some bursts create certain kinds of
afterglows, if any. For example, Swift's &lt;a href="w%3AX-Ray%20Telescope"&gt;X-Ray
Telescope&lt;/a&gt; (XRT) has detected afterglows from several bursts. The UVOT
detected afterglows in GRB 050318 and GRB 050319 in optical light, but
not significantly in ultraviolet.

"Every burst is a little different, and when we add them all up we
will begin to see the full picture," said Keith Mason, the U.K. UVOT
Lead at University College London's 
&lt;a href="http%3A//www.mssl.ucl.ac.uk/"&gt;Mullard Space Science Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;.

Mason said UVOT distance measurements will become more precise in
the upcoming months as new instruments aboard Swift are employed.

Swift is a medium-class explorer mission managed by NASA Goddard Space
Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. Swift is a NASA mission with
participation of the Italian Space Agency and the Particle Physics and
Astronomy Research Council in the United Kingdom. It was built in
collaboration with national laboratories, universities and
international partners, including Penn State; Los Alamos National
Laboratory in New Mexico; Sonoma State University in California; the
University of Leicester in Leicester, England; the Mullard Space
Science Laboratory in Dorking, England; the Brera Observatory of the
University of Milan in Italy; and the ASI Science Data Center in Rome,
Italy.

<h1>Prince Rainier III of Monaco has died</h1>
♡❤♡April 6, 2005♡❤♡ 

His Serene Highness &lt;a href="w%3ARainier%20III%2C%20Prince%20of%20Monaco"&gt;Prince Rainier III&lt;/a&gt; (Rainier Louis Henri Maxence Bertrand Grimaldi) of the &lt;a href="w%3APrincipality%20of%20Monaco"&gt;Principality of Monaco&lt;/a&gt; has died. Prince Rainier has been prince of the tiny Mediterranean country for almost 56 years. He was 81 years old.

He died at 0635 local time (0435 UTC) at the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.ccm.mc"&gt;Centre Cardio-Thoracique de Monaco&lt;/a&gt; with his son Prince Albert by his bedside. He had been hospitalized since March 8, 2005 and his health declined steadily since then. He had been suffering from heart, kidney and lung problems. 

Prince Rainier is famed for being the husband of the late &lt;a href="w%3AGrace%20Kelly"&gt;Princess Grace (Grace Kelly)&lt;/a&gt;, and for investing in business at a famous gambling centre. He was on the throne since 1949, making him one of the longest reigning monarchs in Europe.

Prince Rainier is succeeded by &lt;a href="w%3AAlbert%20II%2C%20Prince%20of%20Monaco"&gt;Prince Albert II&lt;/a&gt;, who has already been serving as regent since March 31.

<h1>Militants attack Kashmir bus route safe house</h1>
♡❤♡April 6, 2005♡❤♡
Islamic militants claimed responsibility for an attack on a government guesthouse sheltering passengers on the first bus in 50 years to cross between the Indian and Pakistani sides of Kashmir.
Authorities say the bus will depart as scheduled Thursday. The attack occurred in Srinagar on the Indian controlled side of Kashmir.

It is unclear whether the passengers or any others in the building, which housed several offices, were injured.

Four Islamic militant groups claimed responsibility later in the day for what they said was a suicide attack on the building complex. So far there has been no information from Indian security personnel as to how the attack was carried off.

Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is expected to come to Srinagar to see the bus off on Thursday despite the attack. Another bus is due to depart from the Pakistani side of Kashmir, bound for India, later the same day.

One bomb exploded along the route yesterday and two other were defused.

The &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AKurds"&gt;Kurdish&lt;/a&gt; population of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; celebrated today the appointment of veteran Kurdish leader Jala♡❤♡l Talabani as t♡❤♡he country's new president. The confirmation comes after Iraqis braved suicide bombings and other attacks to vote on the future of their country's Government more than two months ago. As well as electing Talabani, Iraq's Parliament also appointed &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AShi%27a%20Islam"&gt;Shi'a&lt;/a&gt; Adel Abdul Mahdi and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASunni"&gt;Sunni&lt;/a&gt; Arab tribal leader Ghazi Yawar as vice presidents.

"This is the new Iraq -- an Iraq that elects a Kurd to be president and an Arab former president as his deputy," said Parliament speaker Hajem al-Hassani earlier. During Saddam Hussein's rule, the Sunni minority dominated Iraq, while Shi'ite communities were oppressed and the Kurdish population massacred as they fought against Saddam's regime. The Kurds make up 20 percent of the country's population, while Shi'ites make up 60 percent and the Sunni Arabs make up between 15 percent to 20 percent. Reports say Talabani has pledged to work with all ethnic and religious factions to rebuild Iraq and has called upon neighbouring countries to stop insurgents from further disrupting Iraq.

Although his post is seen by some as a ceremonial position, Talabani's role will include overseeing the completion of Iraq's new constitution by August this year and appointing Shi'ite leader Ibrahim al-Jaafari as Iraq's prime minister.

Echoing the comments of many Kurdish Iraqis, Mohammed Saleh, a 42-year-old Kurd in Kirkuk, told reporters: "Today Jalal Talabani made it to the seat of power, while Saddam Hussein is sitting in jail. Who would have thought."

According to agency reports, Saddam Hussein, imprisoned at a U.S.-run high security facility on the outskirts of Baghdad, was said to be "clearly upset" as Iraq moved closer to becoming a democratic state again. Watching the election results unfold live on Iraqi television, Saddam "realised that it was over, that a democratic process had taken place and that there was a new, elected president," Iraq's human rights minister Bakhtiar Amin told Reuters earlier today.

<h1>Canada presses Iran for an international investigation into Kazemi death</h1>
♡❤♡April 6, 2005♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

&lt;a href="%3Aw%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; pulled out of a trade conference&lt;a href="http%3A//www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20050406.wkaz0406/BNStory/National/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AIran"&gt;Iranian Government&lt;/a&gt; after discussions surrounding the alleged torture and death of photo-journalist Zahra Kazemi fell through. The move comes after accusations by Canada that a Canadian journalist, Kazemi, was savagely attacked in Iran. The allegation was denied by Iran's Foreign Affairs Minister Kamal Kharazi on Tuesday. Canadian ministers have since responded by calling for an international forensic investigation into the Kazemi case.

"We will continue to put pressure on Iran," Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Pierre Pettigrew said yesterday. "This is something on which we will not give up. We know that in Iran it is lies, it is coverups that are being presented to us."

The allegations stem from Iranian born Doctor Shahram Azam, who fled to Canada and revealed last week how he examined Kazemi in June 2003, following her arrest in Iran. Azam told reporters that Kazemi was brought to him by Iranian authorities with severe injuries that were said to have been inflicted whilst in custody. Kharazi dismissed Azam's claims, adding that he has never worked at the hospital in which he claims he treated Kazemi.

&lt;a href="NASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; reports that the Return to Flight mission has started to roll toward the launch pad once again. 

The rollout of the shuttle &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Discovery"&gt;Discovery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , scheduled for April 5 around midnight local time, was moved forward as a precaution when a small crack was discovered in the foam insulation on an external fuel tank. Officials decided it was no reason for concern.

As of 2:04 p.m. EDT (18:04 UTC) today the orbiter began inching out of the Vehicle Assembly Building's hanger at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKennedy%20Space%20Center"&gt;Kennedy Space Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFlorida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and onto the access road for the launch pad 39B. It is expected to reach the launch pad around 8 p.m. EDT.

The actual launch window for the 114th Space Shuttle flight, and the 31st flight of the orbiter Discovery, will be no earlier than May 15 to June 3, 2005.

The trip to the &lt;a href="International%20Space%20Station"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt;, "Return to Flight" STS-114, will last 12 days and be the first flight since the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Columbia"&gt;Shuttle Columbia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; tragedy in 2003. This flight will test a new robot extension arm, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -built Orbiter Boom Sensor System, used to repair the exterior of the International Space Station. 

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Space%20Shuttle"&gt;The Space Shuttle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; goes from standing still on the launch pad to more than 17,000 miles per hour in just over eight minutes. That means the astronauts go 2,000 miles per hour faster every minute.

<h1>Childhood exposure to TV linked to bullying</h1>
♡❤♡April 17, 2005♡❤♡ &lt;br&gt;
In an ♡❤Archives of Pediatrics &amp; Adolescent Medicine♡❤ report, economist Frederick J. Zimmerman Ph.D. and colleagues at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Washington"&gt;University of Washington&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href="w%3ASeattle%2C%20Washington"&gt;Seattle&lt;/a&gt;, found there is a statistically significant relationship between bullying behavior by adolescents and the amount of TV they watched. While previous studies linking the phenomenon have been done before, this study used data from a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; national longitudinal survey involving 1,266 four-year-olds, to provide what authors describe as "empirical support to theories that suggest that bullying might arise out of cognitive deficits as well as emotional ones," according to ♡❤NewsWise♡❤.

Of mothers who reported their children displaying bullying behavior, the study found that those watching 3.5 hours of TV a day were 25% more likely to bully, while those watching 8 hours or more were 200% more likely. The report based its findings on statistics of TV watching by children at age 4, and then compared that history to reports by mothers of their child's behavior between the ages of 6 to 11.

“The magnitude of the risk associated with television… is clinically significant,” the report's authors wrote. Bullying behavior by school children is thought by some to be a health problem.

The study also assessed parental factors that reduced the negative impact of watching television. These included taking children on outings and activities, reading to them, and regularly exposing them to new ideas. Results suggest that children receiving cognitive support were a third less likely to become bullies.

Another parental factor looked at was providing emotional support. Simple things like eating together and talking about topics important to children were found to have an effect.

<h1>Japan announces moon program</h1>
♡❤♡April 6, 2005♡❤♡

"Until now, the question has been, 'Can Japan develop its own manned spaceship?' We will know the answer in another 10 years," JAXA Chairman Keiji Tachikawa told the ♡❤Associated Press♡❤.

The plan includes the development of robots and &lt;a href="w%3Ananotechnology"&gt;nanotechnology&lt;/a&gt;, and calls for the design of a space vehicle to carry passengers and cargo to the moon. The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) asked for a budget increase to about US$2.6 billion a year to fund the program.

Aerospace professor Taketoshi Hibiya, who works at the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Technology, questioned the value of going to the moon.
"If you are hoping to exploit energy resources for example, the question is whether you gain more energy than you expend getting to the moon and back," Hibiya told ♡❤Reuters♡❤. "As scientists, we want to experiment with everything, including manned flight, if we can get the money," he said. "Unfortunately, the country's budget is in a bad way at the moment."

Japan is running a national debt of 751 trillion yen (US$6.94 trillion).

Japan said it would decide within 10 years whether it would pursue its moon program on its own, or if it would team up with other nations.

No country has sent a manned mission to the moon since the Apollo program of the 1960s and 1970s. China and Russia are both planning moon programs of their own. China plans to send a satellite to the moon in 2007. Russia has a plan to send personnel to the moon sometime between 2015-2020 as part of a larger program to one day send a mission to Mars.

JAXA's next mission will survey the moon with the ♡❤SELENE♡❤ probe. The mission was scheduled to launch this year, but has been delayed for unknown reasons.

♡❤♡April 6, 2005♡❤♡ 

A US Chinook helicopter crashed in south-eastern Afghanistan 80 miles south west of Kabul, killing at least sixteen people on board. Another two are missing, presumed dead.

The crash is believed to be an accident; there are no indications that it was shot down. 

The helicopter went down near the city of Ghanzi at 2.30pm local time in bad weather while on a routine flight to Bagram airport. A second helicopter which was with the first arrived at Bagram safely.

Rescue operations were started at once but work at the site has been suspended for the night.

The identities of the dead are currently not known.

As many as four million pilgrims are expected to flock to &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARome"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt; for the Pope's funeral Friday. &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AItaly"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; authorities have in response urged visitors to avoid entering the centre of Rome and instead use a special camp open on the outskirts of the city. Already one million people have arrived to see the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3APope%20John%20Paul%20II"&gt;Pope John Paul II's&lt;/a&gt; body lying in state and officials have said that it will be impossible for visitors arriving now to witness the funeral first hand.

"The city centre cannot take the arrival of any more faithful," Guido Bertolaso, head of crowd control for the funeral, said today. He added: "Anyone arriving tonight or tomorrow will have no possibility of following the funeral at St. Peter's."
The city of Rome, which is normally home to three million inhabitants, is said to now be focusing its efforts on tightening its security ahead of Friday's event. The 200 foreign delegates expected to be present at the funeral are said to be an attractive terrorist target, resulting in the closure of Italy's air space over Rome during the day, sources have claimed.

Speaking to the Associated Press, an official of the Rome prefect's office, which is responsible for coordinating the city's security said: "Precautions have been taken for airports, stations and all the other places where people gather." Authorities have also increased the number of law enforcement officers in the city centre for the occasion.

In a document dated March 30, 2005 by a group calling itself "the 70 million people of Iran," a declaration was issued asking the current government of &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;The Islamic Republic of Iran&lt;/a&gt; to "...peacefully surrender the power to its rightful owners..." by June 16 of this year. The group's relationship to &lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20political%20parties%20in%20Iran"&gt;political parties in Iran&lt;/a&gt; is not known.

The document addresses the &lt;a href="Sayyed%20Ali%20Khamenei"&gt;Supreme Leader Khamenei&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAkbar%20Hashemi%20Rafsanjani"&gt;Chairman Akbar Rafsanjani&lt;/a&gt; of the Expediency Council, and &lt;a href="Mohammad%20Khatami"&gt;President Khatami&lt;/a&gt;, and enumerates the group's grievances against the regime. It threatens boycotts and blackouts throughout Iran on June 10 if there are no indications the regime intends to comply with its demands. Copies of the document have been furnished to the leaders of the &lt;a href="w%3AEU"&gt;EU&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.

The group alleges that &lt;a href="w%3Aelections%20in%20Iran"&gt;elections&lt;/a&gt; that regularly take place in Iran are biased:, writing ♡❤"Your own meaningless and rigged elections will be your undoing,"♡❤ but does not seem to propose constitutional changes. It uses words suggesting they plan to use violence, including &lt;a href="w%3Aextrajudicial%20execution"&gt;extrajudicial execution&lt;/a&gt;, against the reformist president &lt;a href="w%3AMohammad%20Khatami"&gt;Mohammad Khatami&lt;/a&gt; and against the conservatives who dominate parliament: ♡❤"Beginning on June 18 and every day thereafter, we shall strike like a furious flood to cleanse our nation from your filthy existence. ...if you have been so foolish to stay behind, you will experience our rage. Retribution will be swift for those who stay behind and stand in our way."♡❤

A separate document to the leaders of the &lt;a href="w%3AG8"&gt;G8&lt;/a&gt; nations asks for their support, and promises armed resistance to the current government of Iran on June 18, 2005 if peaceful remonstrances fail to have their intended effect.

The source for the translation and dissemination of the documents into English, French and German calls itself the Iran of Tomorrow Movement (IOTM), an exile group operating from &lt;a href="w%3AEncino%2C%20California"&gt;Encino, California&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. The group claims there are "2,195 resistance cells" operating in Iran and abroad.

<h1>ABC News anchorman Peter Jennings diagnosed with lung cancer</h1>
♡❤♡April 7, 2005♡❤♡

&lt;a href="%3Aw%3AABC%20News"&gt;ABC News&lt;/a&gt; anchorman &lt;a href="%3Aw%3APeter%20Jennings"&gt;Peter Jennings&lt;/a&gt; was diagnosed this week with &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ALung%20Cancer"&gt;lung cancer&lt;/a&gt;. Despite beginning out-patient treatment next week which will involve &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AChemotherapy"&gt;chemotherapy&lt;/a&gt;, Jennings will continue to front ABC's 'World News Tonight' show, "to the extent he can do so comfortably", says ABC News.

"Almost 10 million Americans are living with cancer," Jennings told ABC staff on Tuesday. "I am sure I will learn from them how to cope with the facts of life that none of us anticipated." The 66-year-old anchor man, who gave up smoking several years ago, added: "I hope it goes without saying that a journalist who doesn't value deeply the audience's loyalty should be in another line of work."

Jennings began his career at ABC News in 1964 and in 1983 was made senior editor and anchor of ♡❤World News Tonight♡❤. Due to ill health, he was unable to work during his network's special report on the recent death of &lt;a href="w%3APope%20John%20Paul%20II"&gt;Pope John Paul II&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>Hackers crack Sony PSP to allow Internet chat, web surfing</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Hackers%20crack%20Sony%20PSP%20to%20allow%20Internet%20chat%2C%20web%20surfing&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3ASony"&gt;Sony's&lt;/a&gt; recently introduced &lt;a href="%3Aw%3APlaystation%20Portable"&gt;Playstation Portable&lt;/a&gt; has proved popular with curious geeks who discovered various talents hidden within the new handheld video console.

The biggest 'hack' so far has been the manipulation of a web browser embedded within the PSP game 'Wipeout Pure', which can be easily coaxed into accessing the majority of Internet via a suitable portal. Jonathan Terleski was able to monitor the digital conversation held between his PSP and Sony's website when the browser in his game 'Wipeout Pure' would try to download new software from Sony via the Internet. Using a suitably set up &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ADNS"&gt;DNS server&lt;/a&gt;, Terleski configured his handheld console to access his own custom PSP portal, instead of Sony's website, and then invited other owners to use his gateway to the web. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.base2.org/~fugimax/weblog/archives/000293.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

From this discovery, Robert Balousek later created a web based &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AIRC"&gt;IRC&lt;/a&gt; interface that allows people to talk to each other and hold conversations in real time via the Internet on their PSP consoles. According to Reuters, his IRC website has to date been used by as many as 100,000 visitors and Balousek now plans to introduce a web based interface to the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AAOL%20Instant%20Messenger"&gt;AOL instant messaging network&lt;/a&gt; for PSP users.

Other notable recent 'hacks' include reading &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AeBook"&gt;ebooks&lt;/a&gt; and comics and watching pre-recorded television shows, taken from a &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ATiVo"&gt;TiVo&lt;/a&gt;, on the Sony PSP.

None of the 'hacks' have yet employed writing custom software for the device. So far, most are spin-offs of Jonathon Terleski's web browser hack. Other hacks, like the ebook reader and television show viewer, are made possible through use of the PSP's built in tools for viewing video and images. Sony has not yet released an SDK which would allow end-users to write 'homebrew' software, therefore hackers are tied to manipulating software included with the PSP or available through the games purchased separately.

Speaking to Wikinews, Jacob Metcalf, who documented the web comic's hack on his website, explained his motivation: "Web comics are already designed for on-screen reading and they have some of the same audience as people who play games - lots of the most popular web comics are about gamers, like PVP and Penny Arcade."

He added: "I do wish that [Sony] would come out with an actual web browser like the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ADreamcast"&gt;Dreamcast&lt;/a&gt; had. South Korea is &lt;a href="http%3A//www.eurogamer.net/article.php%3Farticle_id%3D58441"&gt;going to get a real web browser&lt;/a&gt; and I have a feeling in my gut that there is going to be Internet software for the PSP like a web browser and email announced at &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AE"&gt;E3&lt;/a&gt; this year."

<h1>Bitmover ends free Bitkeeper, replacement sought for managing Linux kernel code</h1>
♡❤♡April 7, 2005♡❤♡ 

Bitmover, the company producing a management program for computer source code named &lt;a href="w%3ABitKeeper"&gt;Bitkeeper&lt;/a&gt; (BK), announced on April 5 that it will no longer be providing a free version of its product.

As a result of Bitmover's announcement, the programmer who wrote the original Linux kernel, Linus Torvalds, stated on a mailing list that he "decided to not use BK mainly because [he] need[s] to figure out the alternatives". As to an alternative to Bitkeeper, Torvalds hinted that he is considering &lt;a href="w%3AMonotone%20%28software%29"&gt;Monotone&lt;/a&gt; but that &lt;a href="w%3ASubversion"&gt;Subversion&lt;/a&gt;, a recent replacement for CVS, is out of the running. Bitkeeper was originally developed to allow Torvalds to manage code contributions more easily, according to Jeremy Andrews at Kerneltrap.org, and was previously provided to kernel developers free of charge, though it was restricted in its use.

Bitkeeper is the software that Torvalds and hundreds of other Linux developers use to manage submissions of code to the Linux kernel, the heart of the computer operating systems referred to as "Linux" or "GNU/Linux". Linux is distributed in many different forms, bundled with other software by companies such as Red Hat, Novell, and Linspire.

While the details are not clear, it appears from Andrews' article that Bitmover's decision to stop releasing the free version of Bitkeeper is related to a dispute with Torvalds' employer, &lt;a href="w%3AOSDL"&gt;Open Source Development Labs&lt;/a&gt; (OSDL).

According to Kerneltrap, an OSDL contractor had been reverse engineering the free version of Bitkeeper in order to make an open source replacement, which is prohibited by the license under which the free version of Bitkeeper is released. Nevertheless, Torvalds notes in his post that he is "personally very happy with BK, and with Larry [McVoy, the CEO of Bitmover]."

<h1>Western Australia apologises to abused wards-of-state</h1>
♡❤♡April 7, 2005♡❤♡ 

The state Premier of &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20Australia"&gt;Western Australia (WA)&lt;/a&gt;, Dr &lt;a href="w%3AGeoffrey%20Gallop"&gt;Geoff Gallop&lt;/a&gt;, gave an apology to children physically and sexually abused in institutional care within the state between the 1920s and 1970s. The statement was given in reaction to an Australian Senate inquiry into institutional child abuse published last year.

"We acknowledge our state's history, the role played by the state in providing care for children and particularly past practices in the provision of care," Dr Gallop told &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Associated%20Press"&gt;♡❤Australian Associated Press♡❤&lt;/a&gt;.

"We apologise to all those people who were harmed as children while in institutional care, and express deep regret at the hurt and distress caused. We recognise that the effects of physical, psychological and sexual abuse did not end when these children became adults."

Many of the children had been placed in care by government agencies.

"Overwhelmingly, the (submissions) make tragic and distressing reading. They tell of neglect, of shocking abuse, of predatory behaviour from so-called carers and of criminal activity," Senator McLucas told federal parliament at the time of the ♡❤Forgotten Australians♡❤ report, last year.

"The evidence is also there that authorities in the church and in governments either knew or should have known that much of this horrific activity was occurring."

The inquiry found that an apology was an important symbolism in recognising past wrongs and helping victims gain closure, according to an ♡❤ABC News♡❤ report. And Dr Gallop said the victims' personal histories must be heard and acknowledged in order to build a better care system for the future.

WA's Community Development Minister, Sheila McHale, said those wishing to find out about their time in care in WA as children should contact the Department for Community Development, which is also providing counselling services to those who were abused in an institution.

<h1>FBI starts investigation of charges of shoddy work on new SF Bay bridge</h1>
♡❤♡April 7, 2005♡❤♡ 
The &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation"&gt;Federal Bureau of Investigation&lt;/a&gt; is investigating allegations of wrongdoing in the building of a new $1.5 billion "skyway" portion of the &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco-Oakland%20Bay%20Bridge"&gt;San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, according to a report published in the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AOakland%20Tribune"&gt;Oakland Tribune.&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ The bridge spans the &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco%20Bay"&gt;San Francisco Bay&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href="w%3AOakland%2C%20California"&gt;Oakland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AYerba%20Buena%20Island"&gt;Yerba Buena Island&lt;/a&gt;. There are so far no criminal charges filed.

The paper reported that welders for KFM, the company under contract to build the bridge, told authorities they were pressured &amp;ndash; and even paid monthly bonuses of between $200 and $600 &amp;ndash; for performing substandard welds on the support piers for the bridge if it meant the project proceeded faster. But &lt;a href="w%3ACaltrans"&gt;Caltrans&lt;/a&gt;, the state agency in charge of building the bridge said their inspectors checked the welds and determined the work, although rushed, met safety standards.

"We've got good welds, good procedures and everything is in place to have a quality product. If a defect got in, we can't find it," Pete Siegenthaler, Caltrans project manager told the Tribune in an interview. A KFM spokesman told the ♡❤Tribune♡❤ that the welds are in "compliance with stringent Caltrans specifications."

According to a report by Oakland television station, &lt;a href="w%3AKTVU"&gt;KTVU&lt;/a&gt;, the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Labor"&gt;Department of Labor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Department%20of%20Transportation"&gt;U.S. Department of Transportation&lt;/a&gt; are joining the FBI in the investigation of the matter. The federal government is getting involved in the investigation because more than $1 million in U.S. taxpayer money was spent during its construction.

If questionable welds are found in the support piers, according to reports, much of the new construction may have to be torn down to be rebuilt.

The current 68-year-old span was damaged in the 1989 &lt;a href="w%3ALoma%20Prieta%20earthquake"&gt;Loma Prieta earthquake&lt;/a&gt;. At $6.2 billion total, the new bridge qualifies as the largest public works project in California's history.

<h1>Separatists fail to stop re-opening of Kashmir bus service</h1>
♡❤♡April 7, 2005♡❤♡
A bus service successfully crossed the disputed region of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AKashmir"&gt;Kashmir&lt;/a&gt; today despite coming under attack early on in its journey. It is believed Islamic separatists launched grenades at the Indian run bus minutes after it left a station in Srinagar, although the coach continued on to Muzaffarabad after it survived without damage. Whilst its passengers escaped unhurt, the attack is understood to have injured four other people, including a policeman. Indian authorities also located and defused at least one explosive device placed along the bus route.

The service, the first of its kind in almost 60 years, transported Pakistani and Indian Kashmiris across the conflict torn region, passing the cease fire line between India and Pakistan, dubbed the 'Line of Control'. The bus trips, which run to and from &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASrinagar"&gt;Srinagar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AMuzaffarabad"&gt;Muzaffarabad&lt;/a&gt;, are seen as a major step forward in the growing peaceful relations between &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;. The two nuclear powers both seek to control the Kashmir region, which has been a flashpoint for conflict for over 50 years. &lt;a href="http%3A//news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/2739993.stm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

"A door has opened," said Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today as the bus set off from Srinagar. "Pakistan and especially President General Pervez Musharraf have helped us open this door and without their support, the door would not have opened. This is the beginning of a new phase. Violence is not going to solve any problems." 

Anti-Indian separatist Kashmiri militants have branded the return of bus service as a "betrayal of peace", according to reports.

Earlier this week, guerrillas attacked a Government safe house where the bus' passengers were said to be staying.

<h1>Brazilian cardinal criticizes President after inquired about Brazilian Pope</h1>
♡❤♡April 8, 2005♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

&lt;a href="Brazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;ian cardinal Dom Eusébio Oscar Scheid, Archbishop of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARio%20de%20Janeiro"&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , harshly criticized Brazilian President &lt;a href="Luiz%20In%C3%A1cio%20Lula%20da%20Silva"&gt;Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva&lt;/a&gt; after arriving in Rome on Tuesday. The criticism was in response to a journalist from the Brazilian newspaper ♡❤O Estado de São Paulo♡❤ who asked if it was now time for Brazil to have a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APope"&gt;Pope&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; after having a worker President.

Dom Eusébio said: "No, don't put Lula [the Brazilian Presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva] in this story, not yet. You'll mess up everything because he and the Holy Spirit don't agree that well. Do you think that he knows the Holy Spirit?"

Eusébio, commenting on the Brazilian President's opinions about the new Pope, said "Lula shouldn't try to interfere or give hunches." He also added that, "Lula doesn't have a straight faith. His attitudes are not logical under our faith. His faith isn't cultivated. Lula is not Catholic, he is chaotic."

He went on to criticize the government, saying "Lula is very poorly advised. We are almost under a dictatorship because everybody is from PT [the Workers' Party]... I have some doubts about Lula's words. Politicians say one thing one time and they say other things later."

On Brazilian foreign policy, Archbishop Eusébio said: "It is extremely towards the left... [I think about the visit of President Lula da Silva to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFidel%20Castro"&gt;Fidel Castro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ] that they were two fools meeting each other. The Left has never benefited anyone. Look at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and Cuba."

The Brazilian cardinal Dom Eusébio Oscar Scheid has been discussed as a possible &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Apapabile"&gt;papabile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , or one who could become Pope, though he has said "Nobody wants to be Pope. Who wants to be Pope?"

Until Wednesday, the Brazilian government declined to comment on Dom Eusébio's interview.

Dom Eusébio Oscar Scheid, along with Dom Cláudio Hummes who is Archbishop of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AS%C3%A3o%20Paulo"&gt;São Paulo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , tried to play down the statements on Wednesday. Dom Eusébio said of the interview, it was made on an inappropriate occasion, after a long, tiring flight and that he didn't want to disrespect the government. According to Dom Eusébio, the succession of &lt;a href="John%20Paul%20II"&gt;John Paul II&lt;/a&gt; is not a subject which the President should address. Dom Cláudio said that President Lula ♡❤is♡❤ Catholic, in his way. 

Dom Eusébio Oscar Scheid is 73. He will take part on the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AConclave"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that will choose the new Pope. Dom Cláudio Hummes, 71, is seen as a serious Latin-American candidate to the succession of Pope John Paul II.

<h1>Australia appeals for no execution in Indonesian drug case</h1>

A 27-year-old former beauty student from the Gold Coast of &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; faces the &lt;a href="w%3Adeath%20penalty"&gt;death penalty&lt;/a&gt;. She was allegedly caught at &lt;a href="w%3ABali"&gt;Bali&lt;/a&gt; airport importing marijuana from Australia in October. Appearing before an &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;n judge after authorities found 4.1kg of high-grade &lt;a href="w%3Acannabis"&gt;cannabis&lt;/a&gt; in her unlocked boarding bag, she could be sentenced to &lt;a href="w%3Adeath%20by%20firing%20squad"&gt;death by firing squad&lt;/a&gt;, the maximum penalty for the crime.

With that possibility looming for Ms. Corby, her father journeyed to her side, and an anonymous email petition was distributed around Australia and overseas, calling on the Australian government to ensure that, innocent or guilty, Ms. Corby is returned to Australia to escape execution.

An Australian witness who volunteered information which he says will endanger his own life, has testified that Schapelle Corby was unwittingly caught up in a domestic Australian drug-running operation gone wrong. The man alleged that Australian airport workers had placed the contraband in her luggage after it had been checked-in, with the drugs to have been removed before the luggage left Australia. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.keralanext.com/news/indexread.asp%3Fid%3D165927"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Ms. Corby, who says she is innocent of the charges, staggered and paused to vomit while being led through a throng of journalists watching her trial in &lt;a href="w%3AJakarta"&gt;Jakarta, Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;, earlier today.

"I'm really sick," Ms. Corby told Densbar's head judge Linton Sirait, who told her to take better care of herself in jail so she would not get diarrhea. "Don't be stressed," Judge Sirait added as he adjourned the trial until April 14.

Her sister said a doctor would visit her in prison to assess her condition. Her father, suffering with prostate cancer, said it was difficult to watch his daughter struggling so hard when things were nearing the "nitty-gritty now."
He added: "The stress and the whole thing and the stomach cramps and the nerves. It's getting on top of her."

Australian politicians, noting the public support thrown behind the Gold Coast citizen, are promising to take her case up on several issues with the Indonesian Attorney-General later today. However, Mr. Corby expressed doubts that politicians could work things out: "It depends on what they call justice here [in Indonesia]. It looks a bit fairyland to me."

"Everything's reversed here. You're guilty until you're proven innocent," commented Mr. Corby in Indonesia. Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono is said to be monitoring the case to ensure the court hands down a just and fair verdict.

<h1>Wikimedia announces Yahoo! support</h1>
♡❤♡April 8, 2005♡❤♡

The &lt;a href="w%3AWikimedia%20Foundation"&gt;Wikimedia Foundation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Yahoo"&gt;Yahoo!&lt;/a&gt; announced on Thursday they reached an agreement by which Yahoo! will provide hosting capacity to Wikimedia. 

Yahoo! will dedicate a significant number of servers in one of its Asian facilities for hosting Wikimedia's free content websites. Jimmy Wales, CEO of the Wikimedia Foundation, says this generous donation will be of particular benefit to the vibrant and growing community of Wikipedia users in that part of the world.

The Yahoo! donation is a gesture of support for the charitable goals of the Wikimedia Foundation, and does not imply any ownership of the content. They do not expect Wikimedia to host advertisements in return for this support.

As of April 7, Yahoo! will also test the integration of Wikipedia content in its French-language ♡❤Yahoo! Search♡❤ &lt;a href="http%3A//fr.search.yahoo.com/search%3Fei%3DUTF-8%26amp%3Bfr%3Dsfp%26amp%3Bp%3Dguatemala%26amp%3Bmeta%3Dvl%253D"&gt;shortcuts&lt;/a&gt;, to be followed by other languages to accommodate users in Asia, Latin America, Europe, and the United States. The shortcuts will show contextually relevant abstracts of &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; articles in response to user queries.

Yahoo! is one of the Wikimedia Foundation's earliest corporate supporters. The relationship began last year with Yahoo!'s integration of Wikipedia into its &lt;a href="http%3A//docs.yahoo.com/docs/pr/release1144.html"&gt;Content Acquisition Program&lt;/a&gt;.

♡❤Expedition 10♡❤ Commander Leroy Chiao, on board the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Space%20Station"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt; (ISS), caught a candid shot of the &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle"&gt;Shuttle craft Discovery&lt;/a&gt; on its way to launch pad 39-B at the Kennedy Space Center.

Chiao used a digital camera from an altitude of 220 statute miles to photograph Discovery during its roll out in preparation for the first launch of a shuttle in the two years since the Columbia disaster. The shot was made at 4:35 Eastern Daylight Time when the ISS flew over the launch site.

Two pads at Launch Complex 39 are visible in the image. Discovery's launch pad, 39-B, is on the left.

<h1>At least four killed by bomb thrown from motorcycle in Cairo</h1>
♡❤♡April 7, 2005♡❤♡

Four people were killed today after a bomb was hurled into a busy bazaar in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ACairo"&gt;Cairo, Egypt&lt;/a&gt;. The blast occurred near the al-Azhar mosque and injured at least an additional 18 people. The bomb is thought to have been thrown from a passing motorcycle, which then landed amongst crowds of tourists and shoppers gathered on al-Moski Street, in Cairo's ancient Muslim centre.

Rabab Rifaat, an Egyptian woman who witnessed the carnage, said she heard "a boom, a horrible sound, very loud", immediately before seeing body parts flying through the air.

The explosion was followed by a grisly scene, according to doctors who say a French female tourist killed by the bomb arrived at a local hospital in an "unrecognizable state". At least one man died of his injuries later in hospital, sources claim, while hundreds of police sealed off the scene. The Egyptian Government later confirmed that four French, three Americans, an Italian, a Turk and nine Egyptians were injured in the blast.

The &lt;a href="http%3A//touregypt.net/azharmosque.htm"&gt;al-Azhar mosque&lt;/a&gt; is regarded as being an important Islamic learning institution. Last October, 34 people died when Islamic militants bombed several hotels in the Sinai peninsula, targeting tourist hotspots in Egypt.

Egyptian officials are continuing to investigate the attack.

The &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House&lt;/a&gt; Energy and Commerce Committee passed an amendment on Wednesday to extend &lt;a href="daylight%20saving%20time"&gt;daylight saving time&lt;/a&gt; by two months. The bipartisan measure is sponsored by Representative &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFred%20Upton"&gt;Fred Upton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Michigan"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, and Representative &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEd%20Markey"&gt;Ed Markey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Democrat&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Massachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;.

"The more daylight we have, the less electricity we use," Representative Ed Markey said. Markey also supported the measure by pointing out the business benefits. "There's more economic activity, because people feel they can walk around safely," he said.

"Extending daylight-saving time makes sense, especially with skyrocketing energy costs," Rep. Fred Upton said.

The bill extends daylight saving time to begin on the first Sunday in March and to end on the last Sunday in November. Daylight saving time currently begins on the first Sunday in April and ends on the first Sunday in October.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Transportation"&gt;U.S. Department of Transportation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; estimates that extending daylight saving time would save 10,000 barrels of oil per day. The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; consumes approximately 20 million barrels of oil per day.

The House is planning to approve the energy bill to which the amendment was attached in several weeks. Several other amendments to the bill are still being debated.

<h1>FDA mandates &quot;black box&quot; for Celebrex, pulls Bextra off market</h1>
♡❤♡April 7, 2005♡❤♡

Drug giant &lt;a href="%3Aw%3APfizer"&gt;Pfizer&lt;/a&gt;’s two blockbuster Cox-2 inhibitor drugs, Celebrex and Bextra, were both cited by the &lt;a href="w%3AFood%20and%20Drug%20Administration"&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; for safety problems, particularly for long term users.

Last Thursday the FDA allowed Pfizer to keep Celebrex on the market if it added the “black box” warning to the physicians’ guideline. This warning is the strongest the FDA can give to doctors, and focuses on the increased chances of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Acardiovascular"&gt;cardiovascular&lt;/a&gt; problems and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Agastrointestinal"&gt;gastrointestinal&lt;/a&gt; bleeding. Doctors should use the lowest possible dosage of Celebrex and for the shortest time necessary, it adds.

Meanwhile, Bextra was taken off the market today. Bextra users were told to stop taking the drug, according to reports.

Pfizer agreed to mandates by a blue ribbon panel of specialists, convened in February, to review the risks associated with the popular Cox-2 class of painkillers. The pills are taken by 50 million people worldwide.

The actions by the FDA are attributed to charges the agency was too slow and allowed manufacturers to report problems voluntarily. It also comes as other experimental Cox-2 drugs emerge, such as Merck’s Arcoxia and Novartis’s Prexige, and seems to raise the requirements for their future approval.

Critics said the Cox-2 inhibitors were over-prescribed and offered no more relief than cheaper over the counter medications such as ibuprofen.

Pfizer Inc ♡❤(&lt;a href="%3Aw%3ANew%20York%20Stock%20Exchange"&gt;NYSE&lt;/a&gt; Symbol PFE)♡❤ was trading at 26.90 at close on Thursday, up 0.15%

<h1>Ethiopia plans to expand country's Internet access</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Ethiopia%20plans%20to%20expand%20country%27s%20Internet%20access&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

At an information technology conference in &lt;a href="Addis%20Ababa"&gt;Addis Ababa&lt;/a&gt;, Prime Minister &lt;a href="Meles%20Zenawi"&gt;Meles Zenawi&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Ethiopia"&gt;Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt; vowed to offer universal Internet connectivity in the country within three years. The government is working with a United States technology company &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACisco%20Systems"&gt;Cisco Systems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to fulfill this promise.

The government will invest US$40 million in the venture, which will lay nearly 10,000 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Akilometre"&gt;km&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Afibre%20optic"&gt;fibre optic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; cable. Ethiopia currently ranks low in Internet penetration, with just 30,000 connections available for its 71 million inhabitants. Part of the program is the installation of Internet access at 450 secondary schools throughout the country.

Zenawi explained the change of heart that led to the decision to invest in this infrastructure project. "Not long ago many of us felt that we were too poor to seriously invest in information and communication technology," he said at the conference. "We were convinced that we should invest every penny we have on securing the next meal for our people. We did not believe serious investment in ICT had anything to do with facing the challenges of poverty that kills. Now I think we know better," he explained to the delegates.

Not everyone thinks that the government knows better. Giovani Peri, Assistant Professor of Economics at University of California, Davis, specializes in macroeconomics and growth theory. Peri believes that the Ethiopian government may be misguided in its direct investment in the build-up of information technology, and should instead create incentives for the private sector to build such infrastructure.

Professor Peri likened the Internet access project to previous failed attempts by African governments to stimulate growth via large-scale projects. "[African governments] in the past tried to build airports ... in the middle of desolation." &amp;mdash; but people need to know that the environment is right for business, he said, not just a good airport. He said that the investment in Internet access might be too early for that country, and that before it is built, the country needs a good educational system to get the scientific community involved in the process of building technology infrastructure.

Ethiopia's population is mostly rural, and over half of the population is illiterate. The country's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGross%20domestic%20product"&gt;GDP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; per capita is US$560.

US Army Sergeant First Class Paul Ray Smith was honored at a ceremony on April 5 at &lt;a href="w%3AArlington%20National%20Cemetery"&gt;Arlington National Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;, where a memorial headstone was unveiled by his widow Birgit, and their two children Jessica, 18, and David, 11.

The headstone is a special, gold-lettered memorial tombstone, one of only six such markers to be found in Arlington. The inscription states, "In Memory of Paul Ray Smith...His Spirit Lives Forever."

Smith was honored posthumously by President George W. Bush on April 4, 2005 with the highest citation for valor that can be bestowed by the US Armed Forces, the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.army.mil/medalofhonor/index.html"&gt;Medal of Honor&lt;/a&gt;, for his actions during Operation Iraqi Freedom on April 4, 2003, the day of his death. During a ceremony in the White House, President Bush presented the award to Smith's family and described him as "a soldier whose service illustrates the highest ideals of leadership and love of our country."

Smith's death occurred while leading a defensive battle against over 100 of Saddam Hussein's Republican Guard. While attempting to build a holding area for enemy prisoners of war about a mile from Baghdad International Airport, Smith and the three dozen men he commanded in the 3rd Infantry Division were surprised and outnumbered. 

During the Medal of Honor ceremony at the White House, President Bush said, "With complete disregard for his own life and under constant enemy fire, Sergeant Smith rallied his men and led a counterattack. Seeing that his wounded men were in danger of being overrun, and that enemy fire from the watchtower had pinned them down, Sergeant Smith manned a 50-caliber machine gun atop a damaged armor vehicle. From a completely exposed position, he killed as many as 50 enemy soldiers as he protected his men."

"Sergeant Smith's leadership saved the men in the courtyard, and he prevented an enemy attack on the aid station just up the road. Sergeant Smith continued to fire...until he took a fatal round to the head. His actions in that courtyard saved the lives of more than 100 American soldiers...We count ourselves blessed to have soldiers like Sergeant Smith, who put their lives on the line to advance the cause of freedom and protect the American people."

The US Army has revealed many details about Smiths' actions that day. While his commander was on a reconnaissance mission, he led the defence of his platoon (and the mortar team, scouts and medical aid station based nearby) by throwing a grenade, firing rockets and firing his own weapon. After a Bradley Fighting Vehicle was forced to withdraw from multiple rocket-propelled-grenade strikes and a lack of ammunition, he ordered another soldier to reverse an armoured personnel carrier back into the scene of the fight, whose original crew had been incapacitated moments before by a mortar. Smith then engaged the attacking Iraqi troops using its roof-mounted un-armoured .50-calibre machine gun, knowing it was the heaviest weapon between the attackers and the troops behind him. Smith fired over 300 rounds before he was killed. The US Army states that his actions killed 20-50 Iraqi troops, and that his actions saved the many US troops stationed nearby.

In an unmailed letter home, Smith said that he was ready to give "all that I am to ensure that my boys make it home". His Medal of Honor citation was given, "For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty."

Smith was also the first ever to earn a Medal of Honor flag, a new award which will be given to all future Medal of Honor recipients since being authorized by Congress in a 2002 law. The flag is a simple design that consists of a blue field, fringed with gold, containing 13 white stars, similar to the Medal of Honor ribbon.

The &lt;a href="w%3ACambridge"&gt;Cambridge city&lt;/a&gt; council adopted a resolution on April 4 to request that the &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Environmental%20Protection"&gt;US Department of Environmental Protection (DEP)&lt;/a&gt; "take explicit account" of the activities of local construction firm &lt;a href="w%3AW.%20R.%20Grace"&gt;W. R. Grace&lt;/a&gt;, which has previously contaminated an industrial area near the &lt;a href="w%3AAlewife%20%28MBTA%20station%29"&gt;Alewife train station&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="w%3AAsbestos"&gt;asbestos&lt;/a&gt;. The council cited Grace's "extraordinarily extensive and well-documented history of contaminating sites and concealing the contamination" as the reason for its request.

The resolution was a reaction to a Response Action Outcome Statement and Risk Characterization (RAO) that W. R. Grace filed with the DEP. The Cambridge Chronicle recently took the filing as evidence that "the state seems poised to stop watching over" the contaminated site.

In February, W.R. Grace was indicted by a federal grand jury for contamination as a product of vermiculite mining operations in &lt;a href="w%3ALibby%2C%20Montana"&gt;Libby, Montana&lt;/a&gt;, USA. The company was also charged with "concealing information about the health affects [sic] of its asbestos mining operations."

Professor Perry Bartlett of &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Queensland"&gt;University of Queensland&lt;/a&gt;'s Brain Institute recommends sex, &lt;a href="w%3Acryptic%20crossword"&gt;cryptic crosswords&lt;/a&gt; and a good run to stave off &lt;a href="w%3Adementia"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;.

The researcher, interviewed on Australian &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt; radio today &lt;a href="http%3A//www.abc.net.au/am/content/2005/s1340007.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, said that with 52,000 Australians expected to be diagnosed with dementia by the end of the year, people wishing to ward off the degenerative disorder may benefit from activities which stimulate growth of new cells in the brain, accompanied by mental exercise to select for survival of the resulting crop of new cells.

"Quite prolonged exercise is very good to make new neurones," said the Professor. "These new nerve cells are really quite vital to our ability to function in the higher brain functions, such as memory and learning. Most of them die. We now know that we can preserve some of them by giving direct stimuli."

Professor Bartlett explained recent research findings, including those from collaborator Jeffrey D. Macklis &lt;a href="http%3A//www.hms.harvard.edu/dms/neuroscience/fac_macklis.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at Harvard in the US.

"There are a lot of hormones and changes in blood that go up and down after exercise, and so that may be a lead to some of the chemicals that can drive the production of nerve cells.

"One of the chemicals that seems to promote &lt;a href="w%3Aneurogenesis"&gt;neurogenesis&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href="w%3Aprolactin"&gt;prolactin&lt;/a&gt;, and prolactin levels are very high in &lt;a href="w%3Apregnancy"&gt;pregnant&lt;/a&gt; females. Prolactin levels, by the way, also go up during sex as well. So one could think of a number of more entertaining activities than running in order to regulate the production of nerve cells.

"Perhaps doing something a little more inquisitive or intellectual might be good at selecting their survival. So perhaps one should run a long distance and do the cryptic crossword or something like that," he said.

Professor Bartlett gave the same suggestions as being potentially helpful in depression, last year in an interview on the ABC ♡❤Science Show♡❤. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.qbi.uq.edu.au/index.html%3Fpage%3D18966%26amp%3Bpid%3D13996"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

"They put guns to us and handcuffed us and threw us to the ground in front of all my neighbors," Ayala told the ♡❤San Francisco Chronicle♡❤ on Thursday evening. "They treated us like trash, like terrorists. It's the worst nightmare," Ayala said.

"I've been dragged through the mud. We've been treated like animals. I've been through too much," Ayala told the ♡❤San Jose Mercury News♡❤ on Thursday evening.

Although police have not named Ayala as a suspect in the case, ♡❤San Francisco ABC 7♡❤ is reporting that the search warrant may be related to Ayala's dead aunt. Ayala disputed the ABC 7 report.

"I would like to know who she is and why I wasn't invited to her funeral," Ayala told the ♡❤Las Vegas Review-Journal♡❤. Ayala stated that she does not have a dead aunt. She also denied reports that a cooler had been seized from her home during the search. Ayala also said that her teenage daughter, Genesis Reyes, had torn shoulder ligaments as a result of the search. The ♡❤Las Vegas Review-Journal♡❤ ran a photo of Reyes wearing a sling in their Friday edition.

However, Ken Bono, a friend of the Ayala family, told the ♡❤Las Vegas Review-Journal♡❤ that police had taken a cooler during the search.

"Basically they kicked the door open. They pulled everything out of the closet," her roommate told a Las Vegas news crew, in a report aired on ♡❤NBC11 News♡❤.

In San Jose, police spokeswoman Gina Tepoorten confirmed to reporters that investigators had served the warrant in cooperation with Las Vegas police on Wednesday, but she refused to reveal specific details about the warrant.

"We're going to conduct a thorough investigation into this case and our investigators are talking to everybody involved, and that includes customers at Wendy's at the time as well as the finder of the finger," Tepoorten said.

Wendy's is offering a US$50,000 reward for information leading to the source of the finger.

"It's very important to our company to find out the truth in this incident," Tom Mueller, Wendy's president and chief operating officer told ♡❤Associated Press♡❤. "We believe someone knows exactly what happened, and hopefully the reward will encourage this person to come forward."

Wendy's claims that their internal investigation shows that the finger did not end up in Ayala's chili through any of the ingredients in their supply chain.

"With all the facts we have, we find no credible evidence to indicate that Wendy's was the source of the foreign object," Mueller said.

Business has fallen off dramatically at Wendy's outlets in &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20California"&gt;Northern California&lt;/a&gt; since the finger was discovered on March 22.

"This has been an ordeal for all of us. Hopefully there will be a resolution soon," Wendy's spokesman Bob Bertini said.

The Wendy's outlet where the finger was found, located at &lt;a href="http%3A//maps.yahoo.com/maps_result%3Fed%3DD4i2bep_0TovidHDYtqrQHRlDHOuccH7Mb1zXxmY%26amp%3Bcsz%3DSan%2BJose%252C%2BCA%26amp%3Bcountry%3Dus%26amp%3Bnew%3D1%26amp%3Bname%3D%26amp%3Bqty%3D"&gt;1405 Monterey Highway&lt;/a&gt;, just south of downtown San Jose, is owned by Fresno-based Jern Management.

Today at 11:30 UTC His Royal Highness &lt;a href="w%3ACharles%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales"&gt;The Prince of Wales&lt;/a&gt; married Camilla Parker Bowles in a civil ceremony at Windsor Guildhall. The union was blessed at 13:30 UTC in a church ceremony at St George's Chapel, &lt;a href="w%3AWindsor%20Castle"&gt;Windsor Castle&lt;/a&gt;. Local police estimated that 20,000 people lined the street of Windsor in order to catch a glimpse of the Royal party.

The civil ceremony was attended by

</ul>
Prince William and Tom Parker Bowles formally witnessed the marriage.

At 6pm the couple left Windsor Castle for RAF Northolt, where an aircraft from the Queen's flight took them to Aberdeen in Scotland to begin their honeymoon.

<h2>A wedding delayed</h2>
The wedding had suffered from a series of delays and changes to arrangements.

Initially the couple had been planning to use &lt;a href="w%3AWindsor%20Castle"&gt;Windsor Castle&lt;/a&gt; for the ceremony, but were unable to do so since it was not licensed for civil ceremonies. After it moved to Windsor Guildhall, the &lt;a href="w%3AElizabeth%20II%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom"&gt;Queen&lt;/a&gt; decided not to attend, immediately generating rumors of a royal snub.

The wedding had originally been scheduled for Friday April 8, 2005. However, the Prince of Wales's commitment to attend the funeral of required that the wedding be postponed until the following day.

&lt;a href="Bill%20Clinton"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, the former President of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States of America&lt;/a&gt;, will make a visit to &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARomania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; on May 21, to participate as the keynote speaker at the BeyondBorders 2005 conference in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABucharest"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt;. The conference will have the theme of "Branding a Country: Building a Reputation from Within" and is the inaugural BeyondBorders conference launched by the Brand Academy, the first Romanian institution dedicated to brand education.

&lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Clinton"&gt;Clinton's&lt;/a&gt; previous visit to Romania was July 11, 1997, when he visited the country to promote political and military integration around the time of the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ANATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; Summit. He was the first US president to visit Romania since the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARomanian%20Revolution%20of%201989"&gt;Romanian Revolution of 1989&lt;/a&gt; that overthrew the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ACommunist%20Romania"&gt;Communist&lt;/a&gt; regime.

The BeyondBorders 2005 conference will focus on strategies to brand Romania and promote it to the world. In recent years, Romania has realised the need for branding and for improving its image in the world in order to fuel prosperity. Branding would focus on building a reputation a positive reputation for the country abroad and emphasising its authentic values. The conference organisers hope that it will act as a springboard for an integrated national branding project for Romania.

The President of &lt;a href="Romania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATraian%20B%C4%83sescu"&gt;Traian Băsescu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , met yesterday with Jonathan Scheele, the head of the European Commission's Delegation to &lt;a href="Bucharest"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt;, as well as with several &lt;a href="European%20Parliament"&gt;European parliamentarians&lt;/a&gt; (MEPs). The parties discussed Romania's accession to the &lt;a href="EU"&gt;EU&lt;/a&gt;, which is particularly important as the Accession Treaty is scheduled to be signed late this month, after being voted on by the European Parliament on April 13.

Băsescu told the delegation that European integration remains Romania's first priority at the moment, and that after negotiations were closed with the EU in December 2004, accession became a matter of internal politics rather than foreign affairs.

The MEPs talked to Băsescu about public opinion regarding EU accession in Romania, as well as the impact of accession on the rural population. Judging from recent polls, the overwhelming majority of Romania's population approve EU accession, even though this may be partly due to the fact that many of them have not been adequately informed of the costs of accession. The parliamentarians also discussed the environment and the situation in neighbouring countries, especially &lt;a href="Moldova"&gt;Moldova&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATourism"&gt;Tourism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was also discussed in the context of promoting Romania's image to European Union citizens.

The delegation also discussed with Băsescu a key issue in Romania's accession process: judicial reform. The Romanian President told the MEPs that Romania has taken bold steps to reform its judiciary and fight &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acorruption"&gt;corruption&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . There is also progress towards forming an anti-corruption department within the Internal Ministry of Romania.

As part of Romania's foreign policy, Băsescu also said that, once a member of the European Union, Romania would act as an advocate for other &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASoutheastern%20European"&gt;Southeastern European&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; states wishing to join the organisation, as well as seeking to attract public attention to the broader &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABlack%20Sea"&gt;Black Sea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; region. &lt;a href="Romania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Bulgaria"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt;are the most advanced countries in Southeastern Europe in terms of EU integration, and will therefore be the first countries in this region to join the 25-nation bloc.

The Romanian Prime Minister, &lt;a href="w%3ACalin%20Popescu%20Tariceanu"&gt;Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu&lt;/a&gt; discussed on Thursday the involvement of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASiemens"&gt;Siemens&lt;/a&gt; in regard to the privatisation of Romanian locomotive company &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AElectroputere"&gt;Electroputere&lt;/a&gt;. 

Electroputere, which is based in the southern Romanian city of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ACraiova"&gt;Craiova&lt;/a&gt;, remains one of the largest state-owned companies in Romania after the fairly rapid privatisation process of 2003 and 2004. There have been attempts to privatise the locomotive manufacturer for a long time, yet all of them failed. However, Gabriel Zbircea, the president of the Authority for the Recovery of State Assets (AVAS) declared in March of this year that they would resume the privatisation process by dividing the company into four divisions, each to be sold separately. 

Siemens is expected to be a major potential buyer of Electroputere, especially regarding the magnitude of deals in transport infrastructure that the Romanian government has conducted up until now with the German corporation.

The funeral of &lt;a href="Pope%20John%20Paul%20II"&gt;Pope John Paul II&lt;/a&gt; took place today in &lt;a href="w%3AVatican%20City"&gt;Vatican City&lt;/a&gt;, in front of &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Peter%27s%20Basilica"&gt;St. Peter's Basilica&lt;/a&gt;. The Pope died on April 2 after a long battle with &lt;a href="w%3AParkinson%27s%20disease"&gt;Parkinson's disease&lt;/a&gt; and several other health problems.

Over four million people went to &lt;a href="w%3ARome"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt; to attend the funeral. The number of people present was so large that it was not possible for everybody to gain access to the funeral in St. Peter's Square. Several large television screens were installed in various places in Rome to let the people watch the ceremony. In many other cities of &lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; and in the rest of the world, particularly in &lt;a href="w%3APoland"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;, similar setups were made, which were viewed by a great number of people.

A large number of high-ranking representatives of many countries, as well as many representatives of the &lt;a href="w%3ARoman%20Catholic%20Church"&gt;Roman Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt; and of several other Churches, were present at the ceremony. Among these were &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;U.S. President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20Iran"&gt;Iranian President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMohammad%20Khatami"&gt;Mohammad Khatami&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20France"&gt;French President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJacques%20Chirac"&gt;Jacques Chirac&lt;/a&gt;.
The high number of people present in Rome and the presence of many important heads of state caused serious logistical and security problems for the Italian Government.

Speculation has already emerged that the late Pope may soon be made a &lt;a href="w%3Asaint"&gt;saint&lt;/a&gt;; he has been referred to as "The Great," a title only bestowed on three of his 263 predecessors - and on none since the ninth century; many pilgrims in the crowd chanted "Santo! Santo!," expressing their desire for him to be elevated to this stature. Some pilgrims held banners reading ♡❤Santo Subito♡❤, meaning "Sainthood Now."

Following the funeral, the body of the Pope was laid to rest beneath St. Peter's Basilica in a private ceremony. Buried with him was a bag of commemorative medals and a scroll with an account of his life.

<h1>Cairo blast kills 3</h1>
♡❤♡April 8, 2005♡❤♡ 

Visitors to popular tourist spots are warned to avoid large groups, the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AEmbassy"&gt;Embassy&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ACairo"&gt;Cairo&lt;/a&gt; said in a statement issued today. A bomb blast yesterday in a Cairo &lt;a href="w%3ABazaar"&gt;bazaar&lt;/a&gt; killed 3 and injured 18. Police are still investigating the cause of the blast which appears to be the work of a single individual.

&lt;a href="w%3AEgypt"&gt;Egyptian&lt;/a&gt; Minister of Tourism, Ahmed al-Maghrabi, in an effort to calm the public told reporters, "people should not be scared away from this country." The explosion killed an American tourist, a French woman and the person who was probably the bomber.

The explosion occurred at al-Moski bazaar near the &lt;a href="w%3AAl-Azhar%20mosque"&gt;al-Azhar mosque&lt;/a&gt;, a popular tourist destination. The bomb was packed with nails, obliterating the person who detonated it. 9 people remain hospitalized, and nobody has claimed responsibility for the blast.

<doc id="7645" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=7645" title="MSN Encarta introduces wiki-like enhancements">
<h1>MSN Encarta introduces wiki-like enhancements</h1>
♡❤♡, ♡❤♡ 
&lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AEncarta"&gt;Encarta&lt;/a&gt; has announced the addition of a blog as well as some wiki-like functionality to the online subscription encyclopedia.
Encarta is welcoming revision suggestions from their users, but they have a disclaimer:

When the changes are implemented at ♡❤Encarta♡❤, readers can click an "Edit this article" link to have their contribution reviewed by editors at Microsoft for possible use. 

The web enhancement has introduced a minor security glitch for the subscription service. When trying to look up an article on Encarta as a non-subscriber, web surfers receive a teaser page suggesting the user sign up for a subscription &lt;a href="http%3A//beta.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761567883/Microsoft_Corporation.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. However, using the editor URL for the same article will get a WYSIWYG display of the article requested; a simple way around the subscription requirement &lt;a href="http%3A//beta.encarta.msn.com/encnet/editor/editor.aspx%3Frefid%3D761567883"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;br style="clear:both"&gt;

<h2>Is Encarta trying to follow Wikipedia?</h2>

In an interview with &lt;a href="w%3AJimmy%20Wales"&gt;Jimmy Wales&lt;/a&gt;, founder of &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, on Friday he suggested the two are not the same, and Encarta's model will not be able to do what Wikipedia does.

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤Q:♡❤ Do you think &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; is going to throw enough money at this to snow under Wikipedia?
BULLET::::- ♡❤A:♡❤ It seems unlikely to me that they can afford to hire enough editors to compete effectively with the thousands of dedicated volunteers at Wikipedia. And it seems even more unlikely that people will voluntarily contribute to Microsoft's closed proprietary project. Who wants to volunteer to make Microsoft even richer, when they can volunteer at Wikipedia and make the world a better place?

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤Q:♡❤ Is this the beginning of large corporate commercial wiki ventures?
BULLET::::- ♡❤A:♡❤ I do think that the wiki editing model has much to recommend it, but companies have to understand that a community is not just isolated individuals you can exploit. Wiki editing is a powerful tool, but it requires a commitment to genuinely caring about the community for it to work.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤Q:♡❤ Encarta broke 40,000 articles not long ago: does this mean they have focused on "hard" and "real" articles and Wikipedia is basically fluff, entertainment?
BULLET::::- ♡❤A:♡❤ Well, amongst our 500,000+ articles (in English Wikipedia alone) of course there are many topics which people might consider fluff. But I think you'd be hard pressed to find any article in Encarta that we don't also cover, usually in a more comprehensive fashion.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤Q:♡❤ You mentioned in your &lt;a href="http%3A//blog.jimmywales.com/index.php/archives/2005/04/08/encarta-goes-wiki/"&gt;blog entry&lt;/a&gt; on this story, and earlier, that most online people aren't likely to give their effort to a company to get rich off without any pay themselves. Does this necessarily mean Wikipedia is a better choice for them?
BULLET::::- ♡❤A:♡❤ When people contribute to Wikipedia, they know that everything they are doing is under a free license. So they don't have to trust nearly as much that the Wikimedia Foundation will do the right thing and take their free contribution and pass it along for free to someone else. With Microsoft, it is just as clear that they will not be doing the right thing. Is Microsoft going to release Encarta under a free license?

A &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVirginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="United%20States%20of%20America"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt; jury found a man, described as one of the top ten spammers in the world, guilty on Friday of the felony crime of using an alias to send massive bulk e-mailings. The 9 year prison sentence handed down by the jury was put on hold by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALoudoun%20County"&gt;Loudoun County&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Circuit Judge Thomas Horne, allowing the perpetrator, Jeremy Jaynes of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARaleigh%2C%20North%20Carolina"&gt;Raleigh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Carolina"&gt;N.C.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , to seek an appeal.

Jaynes, who used the alias “Gaven Stubberfield” as well as others, peddled junk products and pornography. Prosecutors say he grossed up to $750,000 a month by sending at least 10 million emails a day using 16 high-speed lines. 

The case was prosecuted in Virginia because it is the home to the leading &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ainternet%20service%20provider"&gt;internet service provider&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="AOL"&gt;AOL&lt;/a&gt;, the company who instigated the charges. This is the first time a conviction has been gained using the legislation enacted in 2003 to curb bulk e-mail, aka &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASpam%20%28electronic%29"&gt;spam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , from unsolicited distribution into users mailboxes. 

Jaynes remains free on a $1 million bond while his case is appealed. Prosecutors differed with his attorneys on the prospects of Jaynes winning his appeal.

His attorney, David Oblon, though never denying that his client was in the “marketing” business, argued that nine years was too long to sentence an out of state resident for a law that had taken effect just two weeks earlier.

"We have no doubt that we will win on appeal," Oblon told reporters. "Therefore any sentence is somewhat moot. Still, the sentence is not what we recommended and we're disappointed."

Prosecuter Lisa Hicks-Thomas said she was pleased with the outcome and confident the law would be upheld on appeal.

&lt;a href="w%3AMean%20Fiddler"&gt;Mean Fiddler PLC&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most successful music promoters in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; has today agreed to be taken over by the Irish owned Gaiety Investments (owner of MCD Promotions) and &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; based &lt;a href="w%3AClear%20Channel%20Communications"&gt;Clear Channel Communications&lt;/a&gt;. The deal values Mean Fiddler at STG£37.9m (€55.3m; US$71.4m) or £0.60 a share. It will be an all cash transaction.

Mean Fiddler was founded in 1982 by Vince Power, a native of &lt;a href="w%3ACounty%20Waterford"&gt;County Waterford&lt;/a&gt;, Ireland. The company, which started life as a small but trendy club in &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, grew rapidly in the 1980's to encompass a French restaurant and three venues in London; the Acoustic Room, the Powerhaus and Subterania.

Today the company regularly organises some of the largest music events in Europe. It runs the &lt;a href="w%3AReading%20and%20Leeds%20Festivals"&gt;Reading and Leeds music festivals&lt;/a&gt; and also owns a 39% stake in the &lt;a href="w%3AGlastonbury%20Festival"&gt;Glastonbury Festival&lt;/a&gt;.

Rudolph will plead guilty to a string of bombings — an &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACentennial%20Olympic%20Park%20bombing"&gt;attack during the 1996 Olympics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAtlanta%2C%20Georgia"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;; a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABirmingham%2C%20Alabama"&gt;Birmingham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAlabama"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; women's clinic in 1998. He was facing trial on other bombing charges including a lesbian night club and another women's clinic, both in the Atlanta area.

Although one of the victims said she thought the plea bargain put too little penalty on Rudolf for his crimes, prosecutors said it was better to make a deal to put Rudolf in prison for life and protect others from future attack.

The &lt;a href="w%3AMaine"&gt;Maine&lt;/a&gt; Land Use Regulatory Commission (LURC) affirmed on April 6 its previous finding that two cabins on the &lt;a href="w%3AAllagash%20River"&gt;Allagash River&lt;/a&gt; in northern Maine would be permitted to be rebuilt, the Bangor Daily News reports. The commission's initial decision had been appealed; with this decision, the appeal is rejected. The construction is contentious because the river has been protected by the state since 1966. According to the paper, the commission noted that the task of rebuilding the cabins had been listed in the 2003 &lt;a href="http%3A//www.state.me.us/doc/press/AWW_RDA/riverdriversagreement.pdf"&gt;River Driver's Agreement&lt;/a&gt;. The only mention of the so-called Taylor camps in the 3-page agreement is as follows, under the heading "Creation of Historical/Cultural Visitor Center": "Explore idea of Michaud Farm historic place, that could involve restoration of Taylor camps and historical demonstrations--canoe access only."

According to the Maine Bureau of Parks and Lands, the Taylor camps are three log cabins built in the 1930s by Henry and Alice Taylor. Mr. Taylor worked as the Allagash game warden. The Bangor Daily News noted that the other buildings in the area, such as the Michaud Farm, are not included in the permit that was granted this week.

Local resident Gary Pelletier began reconstructing the cabins in the summer of 2004, but was halted by the appeal of the permit granted by LURC, according to the Bangor Daily News. Now that the appeal has been rejected, Pelletier will resume work. Pelletier is quoted by the Bangor Daily News as saying "We're going to gear up," in reference to his preparations for the reconstruction, Allagash resident and town selectman Roy Gardner that there was an ice jam in the river that he estimated was "ten feet thick" earlier this week, according to an article on April 6 in the Daily News.

<h1>Hundreds arrested following pro-democratic rally in Nepal</h1>
♡❤♡April 8, 2005♡❤♡
More than 500 activists, journalists, lawyers and students were arrested Friday in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ANepal"&gt;Nepal&lt;/a&gt;, whilst protesting against King Gyanendra's take-over of the country's government. Human rights groups have now called for a &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; investigation into alleged abuses of civil liberties after King Gyanendra declared a state of emergency at the start of February.

"We see no sign that the rule of law is being restored," Nicolas Howen, secretary general of the International Commission of Jurists, said. "The appalling violence against civilians carried out by the Maoists and security forces continues and the democratic parties, human rights organisations and the media are still intimidated and controlled." 

The state of emergency was initiated to properly tackle Nepal's Maoist rebels who, according to King Gyanendra, seek to replace the monarchy with a communist republic. Fears are now growing that violence in the country will continue to increase and insurgency in Nepal has claimed the lives of at least 11,000 people since 1996. Arjun Karki, president of the Federation of Non-governmental Organisations in Nepal said today: "If they are suppressed, those who support democracy are forced to use other means. So those who repress democracy should really consider their actions first."

Elsewhere in Nepal today, soldiers repelled a rebel assault on one of their bases in the country's northwest, say reports. &lt;a href="http%3A//apnews.myway.com/article/20050408/D89BGB681.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

<h1>UN forced to cut food rations to a million Sudanese</h1>
♡❤♡April 9, 2005♡❤♡

The &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;UN's World Food Programme&lt;/a&gt; says it has received just US$275m of the US$468m it believes is needed to feed two million people in the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ADarfur"&gt;Darfur&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt;. The shortfall will force the organisation to halve its non-cereal daily rations to ensure supplies will last through the coming summer period.

"We are very concerned about the negative effect this drastic ration cut will have on the health and psychological well-being of thousands of people, who are already weakened and traumatised by war," said Carlos Veloso, WFP's emergency co-ordinator for Darfur.

According to the UN, at least 180,000 people have died and more than two million have fled the conflict torn region of Darfur since fighting between black African rebels and Arab militia broke out in 2003. &lt;a href="http%3A//news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3496731.stm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Emmanuel Akwei Addo, the UN's independent human rights expert in the Sudan, claimed yesterday that the 2000 African Union troops present in the remote region were unable to reverse the deterioration of security in Darfur.

He added: "The present situation in Darfur is said to be a time bomb, which could explode at any moment. The rebels have grown more intransigent, and security on the ground is getting worse. Aerial bombardment still goes on."

&lt;a href="w%3ADirectmedia%20Publishing"&gt;Directmedia Publishing&lt;/a&gt;, a German publishing house founded in 1995 that specializes in digital media, announced the release of a DVD of the German Wikipedia earlier this week. The DVD may be purchased online (via sites like Amazon.de) for around 10 Euros, and a free download of the DVD image will be available in a few days for those who prefer to burn their own copies. The DVD includes built-in software, , for browsing and searching through its content.

This new project follows the successful publication of a last October, which distributed over 10,000 physical copies and saw over 100,000 downloads of the CD image. Directmedia worked with Wikipedia editors over the months leading up to the release to finalize and update the DVD content, hosting a tagging party at their headquarters in Amtsgericht Berlin-Charlottenburg, Germany.

The announcement of the release came on April 6, five days after the DVD was first available for online purchase. By the end of the next day, the DVD was the best-selling software package on &lt;a href="http%3A//www.amazon.de"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.

By April 9, all 10,000 copies of the DVD's first production run had been
sold or shipped to resellers. Another production of 10,000 copies is scheduled for April 13th. The complete DVD image should be available for free download in a few more days; the project page&lt;a href="http%3A//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3APressemitteilungen/Wikipedia-DVD"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the German Wikipedia will be updated as soon as the image is available.

&lt;a href="w%3APope%20John%20Paul%20II"&gt;Pope John Paul II&lt;/a&gt; has a Brazilian cousin living in &lt;a href="w%3ARio%20Grande%20do%20Sul"&gt;Rio Grande do Sul&lt;/a&gt;, Brazil. He is João Woidyla, 83, and he came to Brazil in 1914, before John Paul II was born in March, 18, 1920.

According to the story told by local news agencies, the Pope's last
name was Woidyla too, like João's. The Pope changed it to Wojtyła when he left Poland to avoid political persecution. The grandfather of João Woidyla is José Woidyla, who was brother of Pope's grandfather. João's family discovered the relationship when Karol was elected Pope. The pope himself recognized the relationship and sent him a letter.

Pope John Paul II has other cousins in Brazil too: Isidoro, Alfreda, Genoveva (João's wife) and Bolessuaf.

Bolessuaf, 86, likes to read the card written in Polish that he received from his cousin, the Pope.

"A great man, who always fought for the good of the others", he adds.

João and his wife Genoveva met the pope John Paul II during his visit to Brazil in 1980.

The cousins got very sad when they heard that the Pope was gone. "To me, he seems to be a brother, more than my own brother ", said Isidoro. João said about the Pope: "I think he did the work what should be done. I hope the next one works like him". He added: "It is like to lose a father, I am very sad".

According to ♡❤Folha de São Paulo♡❤, Brazilian government invited João to take part in the funeral of the Pope. He declined saying that he is afraid of flying in airplanes.

&lt;a href="w%3AMarburg%20virus"&gt;Marburg virus&lt;/a&gt; is still spreading in Angola, and 180 are now dead, according to recent information from the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organisation"&gt;World Health Organisation (WHO)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.who.int/csr/don/2005_04_08a/en/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The disease is similar to the &lt;a href="w%3AEbola"&gt;Ebola Haemorrhagic Fever&lt;/a&gt; (EHF) virus in its symptoms, though less deadly and slower to spread &amp;mdash; which has lead to more deaths overall. Because Marburg kills more slowly, a victim has more time to make contact with potential hosts.

The incurable, though not always fatal, disease is passed on by contact with bodily fluids, including spit and blood. Victims bleed to death.

As of yesterday, 205 cases had been identified, with at least 180 fatalities. The disease is now present in seven of Angola's provinces, the latest outbreak occurring in Zaire province with six cases. The proportion of deaths in this outbreak was unusually high. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml%3Ftype%3DhealthNews%26amp%3BstoryID%3D8127706"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

According to the WHO, "The dramatic symptoms of Marburg haemorrhagic fever and its frequent fatality are resulting in a high level of fear, which is further aggravated by a lack of public understanding of the disease."

Mobile surveillance teams in Uige, where the majority of cases have been located &lt;a href="http%3A//www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml%3Ftype%3DhealthNews%26amp%3BstoryID%3D8127706"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, were unable to investigate several reported deaths, or to ensure the still-contagious bodies were appropriately dealt with, after transportation vehicles were attacked and damaged by local residents.

Said the WHO through a press release, "Because the disease has no cure, hospitalization is not associated with a favourable outcome, and confidence in the medical care system has been eroded.

"WHO is familiar with such reactions, which have been seen during previous outbreaks of the closely related Ebola haemorrhagic fever. Two medical anthropologists are already in Uige and will be joined shortly by experts in social mobilization from Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Mozambique. Public compliance with control measures is not expected to improve in the absence of intense campaigns to educate the public about the disease."

Provincial authorities were being engaged in an attempt to urgently find solutions.

WHO was appealing, via the United Nations (UN), for funding. The UN health body currently needs US$2.4 million to support the Ministry of Health, Angola.

Some 50 international experts were deployed in Angola, a country where 27 years of civil war has left health systems and staff unable to cope with a major epidemic, according to Mike Ryan, director of WHO's alert and response operations.

"The situation right now in Angola is not under control yet...This is still a health crisis at the national level and requires a profound commitment both from national authorities and the international community in order to contain this disease," he said.

Two deaths had been confirmed in Luanda, Angola's capital of 4 million, and six more cases were being investigated there.

Among the original requirements for the 60 families requested to be participants in the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.epa.gov/cheers/"&gt;“Children’s Health Environmental Exposure Research Study”&lt;/a&gt; (CHEERS) study according to EPA were that they must:

&lt;blockquote type="cite"&gt;
<ul>
BULLET::::- Live in Duval County, Florida
BULLET::::- Be a parent of a child under the age of 13 months
BULLET::::- Spray or apply or have pesticides sprayed or applied inside your home on a routine basis (You do not need to change your regular household routine for the study.)
</ul>
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This original version of the requirements can be &lt;a href="http%3A//web.archive.org/web/20041010164558/http%3A//www.epa.gov/cheers/basic.htm"&gt;viewed&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20Archive"&gt;Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt;, a free online repository that creates copies of websites on a regular basis. The third requirement was reworded by November 2004, according to the Internet Archive: "Maintain your normal pesticide or non-pesticide use patterns for your household. We will not ask any parent to apply pesticides in their home to be a part of this study."

According to the above document, the area of Jacksonville/Duval County was chosen for reasons of existing year-round high usage of pesticides and other household chemicals within the home, as well as relevant data from existing prior studies. The study involved researchers visiting the home of participants, parents videotaping their children's activities with a supplied camcorder, children wearing a small "activity sensor", and parents collecting food and urine samples for detailed analysis of the effects of chemical exposure to common commercially available chemicals, primarily pesticides, on which "current information... is very limited" &lt;a href="http%3A//www.epa.gov/cheers/basic.htm%23why"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. 

Selection for the study began in fall 2004. As incentives for their participation in the planned two-year study, parents were to be given $970, a t-shirt, and other gifts, and would have kept the video camera at its conclusion.

<h3>Senate opposition</h3>
Complaining that the study was necessary, Johnson yielded to two Democratic Senators who had threatened to block him, using all means available, from officially taking the helm of the Environmental Protection Agency, of which he is the acting head. The block on his nomination was lifted afterwards although some &lt;a href="w%3ADemocrat"&gt;Democratic&lt;/a&gt; Senators would not say how they would vote on the final nomination.

Under his guidance, the EPA agreed to accept $2 million for the controversial $9 million CHEERS study from an industry trade group, the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AAmerican%20Chemistry%20Council"&gt;American Chemistry Council&lt;/a&gt;, which represents the chemical insecticide manufacturers. The study was to be conducted with the cooperation of the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.dchd.net/"&gt;Duval County Health Department&lt;/a&gt;, and the US &lt;a href="w%3ACenters%20for%20Disease%20Control%20and%20Prevention"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, based in Atlanta.

Senators Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and Bill Nelson, (D-FLA), demanded the cancellation of the study as proof of Johnson’s acknowledgement of what she called a "gross error in judgment".

“The CHEERS program was a reprehensible idea that never should have made it out of the boardroom, and I am just happy that it was stopped before any children were put in harms way," Boxer said. She added that testing on humans should not be a part of any United States environmental policy.

"I am very pleased that Mr. Johnson has recognized the gross error in judgment the EPA made when they concocted this immoral program to test pesticides on children," Boxer said.

<h3>EPA review</h3>
Work on the study was halted last November by Johnson while an independent review of the study's design was conducted at his request. Part of the reason for the study's current cancellation was what the EPA in its press release has termed "mischaracterization" of the nature of the study as though children were being deliberately sprayed with pesticides.

Johnson defended his approach, "I have concluded that the study cannot go forward, regardless of the outcome of the independent review. EPA must conduct quality, credible research in an atmosphere absent of gross misrepresentation and controversy. I am committed to ensuring that EPA's research is based on sound science with the highest ethical standards."

In November 2004, William Farland, an administrator with the EPA's research department, told ♡❤The Oregonian♡❤, "There's no suggestion that we are asking them to use pesticides. We simply want them to continue to carry out their day-to-day activities."

The top money grossing entertainers in &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; in 2005 were not &lt;a href="w%3AKylie%20Minogue"&gt;Kylie Minogue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANicole%20Kidman"&gt;Nicole Kidman&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="w%3ARussell%20Crowe"&gt;Russell Crowe&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, it was four tot-time entertainers, &lt;a href="w%3Athe%20Wiggles"&gt;the Wiggles&lt;/a&gt;, with their preference for bright colours and sing-along dance numbers. Their earnings level was estimated at AU$45 million over the last year by Australian publication ♡❤Business Review Weekly (BRW)♡❤, in its yearly who's-who ranking of the nation's top 50 entertainment earners.

"They got into the market early, they took time to understand their audience, not only children but the parents who pay for everything," ♡❤BRW♡❤ managing editor Tony Featherstone, said.

Though almost doubling her earnings from the previous year, Nicole Kidman only made second place, at AU$40m. And Crowe came in third, at "only" AU$27m. Fourth place was long-time heavy metal favourites, &lt;a href="w%3AAC/DC"&gt;AC/DC&lt;/a&gt;, whose estimated income was AU$18m.

Another children's entertainment band, &lt;a href="w%3AHi-5"&gt;Hi-5&lt;/a&gt; came in sixth with $15m, after &lt;a href="w%3ANaomi%20Watts"&gt;Naomi Watts&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3AMozilla%20Foundation"&gt;Mozilla Foundation&lt;/a&gt; is in the final stages of preparing the third security update to the popular free Internet browser Firefox.

This update will fix a security issue highlighted by Internet security firm Secunia which allows remote users to read the memory of a computer running earlier versions of Firefox. Information such as the websites the user has recently visited or their e-mail addresses can easily be recovered.

Users can visit the Secunia website and use a test page to see if they are vulnerable and to study the kind of information that the flaw discloses. Secunia currently recommends disabling Javascript in the browser as a short-term measure against the bug.

The release will also fix some bugs discovered in version 1.0.2 and a selection of other security issues.

The third release, to be known as 1.0.3, comes hot on the heels of 1.0.2, released on March 23. As before, users will need to download and install the entire 4.7MB program from mozilla.org, rather than download a Microsoft-style patch. Mozilla is working on an update system that will make updating via smaller patches possible in the future.

This release has had a difficult birth, with initial versions preventing many popular Extensions (user-installed sub-programs that enhance the capabilities of the browser) from operating. Mozilla developers have worked hard on the issue and are now confident that they have plugged security holes in a way which will not cause inconvenience to users.

<h1>Time Warner/Comcast bid to snap up Adelphia cable service</h1>
♡❤♡April 9, 2005♡❤♡
A bid topping &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;17.7 billion was jointly proffered by &lt;a href="w%3ATime%20Warner"&gt;Time Warner Inc.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AComcast"&gt;Comcast Corporation&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday to buy beleaguered &lt;a href="w%3AAdelphia"&gt;Adelphia Communications Corporation&lt;/a&gt; in an industry consolidation move. Adelphia is the fifth largest cable service provider in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; with nearly 5 million subscribers.

The market-share grabbing bid trumps the previous &lt;a href="w%3ACablevision"&gt;Cablevision&lt;/a&gt; offer of $16.5 billion. The bid is under scrutiny by the presiding judge over the Adelphia’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, and must also be approved by the company’s creditors owed in the range of $20 million.

The acquisition race to gain dominance in the cable service provider market is driven by the high cost of installation and maintenance of cable lines. &lt;a href="w%3AOptical%20fiber"&gt;Fiber optic networks&lt;/a&gt; deliver traditional entertainment programming over a cable wire and is becoming increasingly popular for &lt;a href="w%3ABroadband%20Internet%20access"&gt;broadband&lt;/a&gt; internet content. The growing trust and recognition of &lt;a href="w%3AVoice%20over%20IP"&gt;Voice over Internet Protocol&lt;/a&gt; (VoIP) suggests phone service subscribers will eventually migrate to cable voice communication as opposed to keeping with traditional copper land lines. Telephone company operators are scrambling to keep up.

The largest percentage of the bid would be put up by Time Warner (TW), who could gain by getting subscribers from the valuable Los Angeles market currently owned by Comcast and Adelphia. TW can also simultaneously divest itself of a stake owned by Comcast in TW by making a tax-free swap using some of the newly garnered Adelphia subscribers.

While the consolidation would likely get a look by the government with an eye towards a growing monopoly in the market, it would doubtfully be blocked considering the existence of competing technologies. Competition exists in the form of still numerous television by airwaves usage, satellite providers, radio content companies, and telecom providers.

Adelphia suffered a corporate scandal in 1992 with similarities to the WorldCom fall. Members of the Rigas family, founders of the company, were alleged to have siphoned off millions of dollars and hidden $2.3 billion leading to the bankruptcy filing. &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Rigas"&gt;John Rigas&lt;/a&gt; and son Timothy were convicted July of 2004 and await sentencing.

<h1>Drug-resistant infections on the rise in American hospitals</h1>
♡❤♡April 9, 2005♡❤♡ 

A rise in flesh-eating staph infections has worried doctors about the possible spread of drug resistant &lt;a href="w%3Abacteria"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AStaphylococcus%20aureus"&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/a&gt;, commonly known as staph, is a bacteria that commonly causes skin infections in otherwise healthy people. However, as a persistent threat in hospitals, it tends to infect patients who are already sick and whose systems are vulnerable due to IV lines that pierce the skin. Doctors have already battled for years against drug-resistant strains of the bacteria, but the struggle has generally been confined to hospitals. 

Now, however, &lt;a href="w%3AMethicillin%20Resistant%20Staph%20Aureus"&gt;Methicillin Resistant Staph Aureus&lt;/a&gt; (MRSA) has been spreading in communities outside hospitals. Cases have multiplied by 25 times since 1998 at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Chicago"&gt;University of Chicago&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; hospital documented 14 cases of the flesh-eating infection, where patients required substantial time in intensive care and surgery. The infections are particularly problematic because nearly a quarter of people who get a staph infection require hospitalization. 

Staph infections are spread much like other diseases, with crowded conditions, poor hygiene, and skin-to-skin contact most frequently to blame. At higher risk are prison inmates, homeless people, military personnel, and families with kids in day care. Athletes also have a higher risk, because sweating makes it easier for bacteria to infect the skin.

Hitachi Global Storage Technologies, the &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Jose%2C%20California"&gt;San Jose, California&lt;/a&gt;-based joint venture of storage vendor &lt;a href="w%3AHitachi%2C%20Ltd."&gt;Hitachi&lt;/a&gt; and U.S. technology giant &lt;a href="w%3AIBM"&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt;, has set a new record for storage density at 230 gigabits per square inch (Gb/in). The company has developed technology to implement a recording method known as perpendicular recording, which allowed the increase in density above the current ~130 Gb/in limit.

Techworld claims there is a race between Hitachi and &lt;a href="w%3AToshiba"&gt;Toshiba&lt;/a&gt; for who will get the first drives to market which use the technology. According to Hitachi, they expect, "to ship [their] first perpendicular recording product in 2005 on a 2.5-inch hard drive". Toshiba is also planning to ship a drive in 2005 that uses perpendicular recording.

According to Techworld, Toshiba will ship an 80 GB, 1.8" drive in 2005. Toshiba's 1.8" drives are used in portable electronic devices such as Apple's iPod, which is currently available in sizes 60 GB and smaller.

While all commercially available hard drives to date use longitudinal recording, perpendicular recording has roots in research done in academic circles over 100 years ago.

Hitachi Tech has produced &lt;a href="http%3A//www.hitachigst.com/hdd/research/recording_head/pr/PerpendicularAnimation.html"&gt;a Flash animation&lt;/a&gt; that explains the rudiments of perpendicular recording in a music-video style.

Inspired by the 1970s ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASchoolhouse%20Rock"&gt;Schoolhouse Rock&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ series of educational animation shorts, the flash movie features whimsical moments with data bits and disk platters that speak and sing (not possible with today's technology), it also contains realistic details. Of no importance to the viewer, but perhaps of interest to some, the animation shows Texas Instruments' UC5608DWP chips visible briefly in the background. While TI's UC5608DWP 18-line &lt;a href="w%3ASCSI"&gt;SCSI&lt;/a&gt; terminator chips have been made obsolete by the new UCC5618, the chips are indeed designed for use in hard drives.

The TTC workers union, the &lt;a href="w%3AAmalgamated%20Transit%20Union"&gt;Amalgamated Transit Union&lt;/a&gt; Local 113, rejected a deal offered by TTC management. They last went on strike in 1999. The average daily ridership exceeds 1.3 million passengers.

The city of Toronto has prepared to help deal with the forecasted traffic congestion by opening up free parking for car-pools at 14 city-owned community centres, banning parking on some city streets, and opening up some bus-only lanes to car-pools.

The initial deal, which was rejected, offered a 2% wage increase over five years. With a huge turnout the union-members voted against accepting the offer with a 99% majority according to a press release by the union. The union rejected the latest offer Friday reported to be a three-year contract with raises of 2.75 percent in the first year, three percent in the second and 3.25 percent in the third.

The &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AU.S.%20Postal%20Service"&gt;U.S. Postal Service&lt;/a&gt; has filed a request with the independent Postal Rate Commission seeking a 2-cent increase in first-class mail. Other types of mail would probably increase as well, with the proposed higher rates taking effect early next year.

First class mail would go from 37 cents to 39 cents; postcards from 23 cents to 24 cents. 

The Postal Service blamed the proposed increase on a 2003 law requiring the agency to place $3.1 billion annually in an escrow account. They said they would withdraw the rate request if Congress changes the law.

As many as a thousand rioters attempted to storm the &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt; embassy in &lt;a href="Beijing%2C%20China"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt; late Saturday, shouting "Boycott Japan!" and "Japanese pig come out!", throwing rocks and smashing guardhouse windows. Protesters proclaimed, "Chinese people shouldn't protect Japanese," at the 500-odd riot-police who had arrived to guard the compound, wire agencies reported.

The Japanese Government had been criticised earlier this week for approving a controversial history textbook that protesters, as well as many in China and Korea, say whitewashes Japan's wartime atrocities against China. Japan's ambassador to Beijing defended the textbooks, adding that they were produced by private companies and not the Japanese government.

The Chinese &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Daily"&gt;♡❤People's Daily♡❤&lt;/a&gt; provided a report about the events which led up to the riot. The report cited the protesters' demands to "safeguard [the] &lt;a href="w%3ASenkaku%20Islands"&gt;Diaoyu Islands&lt;/a&gt;"; "smash Japan's daydream" of on the UN Security Council; and boycott Japanese-made products.

Between six- and twenty-thousand had turned out for a peaceful, legal anti-Japanese rally earlier in the day, prior to the emergence of the full-scale riot.

"Our generation believes that China must stand up for its rights and stop being soft on Japan," Li Jiangchuan, a college student told ♡❤The New York Times♡❤. "Japan should stop lying about history and tell the truth," he said.

"Every Chinese feels anger at the way Japan ignores its own history and tries to occupy China's sovereign territory," Li Hongbo, 19, student at Tsinghua University, told ♡❤The New York Times♡❤. China and Japan have recently disputed ownership of the string of tiny Diaoyu Islands in the East China Sea, which have natural gas reserves.

According to ♡❤New York Times♡❤♡ reporter Joseph Kahn in Beijing, "Subsequent gatherings at the Japanese ambassador's residence and the Japanese Embassy appeared to have been organized without official approval and were considerably more tense, with the police closing off many roads and busing in reinforcements to maintain order."

Participants in demonstrations also attacked the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi branch and a Japanese restaurant whose waitresses wear &lt;a href="w%3AKimono"&gt;kimonos&lt;/a&gt;, reported &lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;♡❤Reuters♡❤&lt;/a&gt;. Thousands also threw stones at the home of the Japanese ambassador to China, Koreshige Anami, according to the &lt;a href="w%3AKyodo"&gt;♡❤Kyodo News♡❤&lt;/a&gt; agency.

Japan formally protested the event with the Chinese diplomatic mission in &lt;a href="w%3ATokyo"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;. Chinese diplomats expressed regret that the protest had gotten out of hand.

"The fact that people took actions such as throwing rocks at the ambassador's residence as well as the embassy is not something that the Chinese government can accept," Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Qiao Zonghuai was quoted as saying. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml%3Ftype%3DworldNews%26amp%3BstoryID%3D8132701%26amp%3BpageNumber%3D1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

"Representing the government, I offer my heartfelt sympathy and express my regret" he said.

"Some people in Beijing organised a demonstration themselves in protest against the wrong attitude and practice Japan had taken recently on the issue of its history of aggression," Foreign Ministry spokesperson Qin Gang was quoted as saying &lt;a href="http%3A//www.swissinfo.org/sen/swissinfo.html%3FsiteSect%3D143%26amp%3Bsid%3D5669936"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

"The Chinese government demanded the demonstrators to keep calm and sane, give voice to their attitude in a lawful and orderly way, and not to engage in excessive action," he said.

However, the &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;♡❤BBC♡❤&lt;/a&gt; reported that the authorities had signaled "tacit acceptance, if not approval" by allowing Saturday's protest to happen in the first place. &lt;a href="http%3A//news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4429809.stm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Reporting of at least the initial larger rally by Chinese &lt;a href="w%3AMedia%20in%20the%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;government-operated media&lt;/a&gt; outlets such as ♡❤People's Daily♡❤ quoted above, was 'rare', according to a number of sources. As explained by Japanese ♡❤Kyodo News♡❤, "China's state media seldom reports on protest rallies inside China." &lt;a href="http%3A//home.kyodo.co.jp/all/display.jsp%3Fan%3D20050410004"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Reports indicate that the initial protest was organised substantially by communication over the internet, including email, bulletin boards, and instant messaging. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.swissinfo.org/sen/swissinfo.html%3FsiteSect%3D143%26amp%3Bsid%3D5669936"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http%3A//www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-04/09/content_432767.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The demonstrations have been attributed a number of records for size-in-recent-years, including "largest to be held in the capital since a massive outpouring [of] anti-American sentiment in 1999, after the United States bombed China's embassy in Belgrade during the war against Serbia"; &lt;a href="http%3A//www.nytimes.com/2005/04/09/international/asia/09beijing.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; "the biggest protest against foreigners since [the same event]" &lt;a href="http%3A//www.swissinfo.org/sen/swissinfo.html%3FsiteSect%3D143%26amp%3Bsid%3D5669936"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; "one of the largest protest events authorized by the Chinese government in years" &lt;a href="http%3A//www.nytimes.com/2005/04/10/international/10china.LONG.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; and "the largest anti-Japanese demonstration in Beijing since the two countries normalized diplomatic ties in 1972" &lt;a href="http%3A//www.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/getarticle.pl5%3Fnn20050410a1.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>Gaza cease fire rocked by latest killing of youths</h1>
♡❤♡April 9, 2005♡❤♡

The two month old truce between &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3APalestine"&gt;Palestinians&lt;/a&gt; is still intact after three teenagers were shot down earlier today while trying to smuggle firearms through the Egyptian border. Palestinians claim they saw the children attempting to fetch a football that had landed in a no-go zone near a refugee camp, in southern &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AGaza"&gt;Gaza&lt;/a&gt;. Israeli army sources say the youths entered a forbidden area heavily guarded by Israeli forces near the border with &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEgypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;. The teenagers were fired upon by soldiers after they ignored warning shots.

Militants responded by firing mortar shells at Jewish settlements in Gaza, although no one was injured.

The level of violence in the Gaza region had dropped significantly since the cease fire was agreed upon by both sides of the conflict. Islamic Jihad chief Mohammed al-Hindi said today: "So far, the Palestinian factions have not declared an end to the calm... but they are studying the issue anew because of continued Zionist aggression." Saeed Siyam, a Hamas leader in Gaza, told the ♡❤Associated Press♡❤: "The Palestinian people cannot stay silent in the face of this crime and it cannot pass without punishment."

"These kids were not playing soccer," said an anonymous Israeli army commander today. "You don't get there by accident."

<h1>Thousands march on Baghdad in anniversary protest</h1>
♡❤♡April 10, 2005♡❤♡
Tens of thousands of protesters waving national flags marched in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad, Iraq&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday, the anniversary of the toppling of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASaddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt;. Chanting "No, no to the occupiers," they massed at Firdos Square on the site where Hussein’s statue was pulled down two years ago today.

Central Baghdad shut down ahead of the march and Iraqi security searched most protesters before entering the city. US and other peace-keeping forces remained out of sight. The march, sponsored by the cleric &lt;a href="w%3AMuqtada%20al-Sadr"&gt;Muqtada al-Sadr&lt;/a&gt;, passed with no notable violence or arrests, and the crowd was dispersed by early evening.

There were simultaneously another 5000 protesters who marched in &lt;a href="w%3ARamadi"&gt;Ramadi&lt;/a&gt;, a city west of Baghdad.

Calling for the withdrawal of occupation forces, protesters aped the televised images of occupation forces by knocking down their own effigies of &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George Bush&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASaddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam&lt;/a&gt; himself. The effigies were clothed in red &amp;mdash; a symbolism they have been marked for death.

Iraqi Ali Feleih Hassan told the ♡❤Associated Press♡❤, "No one accepts this. I want them out. They have been here for two years, and now they have to set a timetable for their withdrawal."

The US has been unable to set a timetable and is determined to stay until they believe the country is secure. &lt;a href="w%3AMuqtada%20al-Sadr"&gt;Muqtada al-Sadr&lt;/a&gt;, an opposition negotiator, ultimately ended an uprising after signing a peace agreement with US forces last August.

<h1>Australia unemployment at 30-year low, but under-employed also at 5.1%</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Australia%20unemployment%20at%2030-year%20low%2C%20but%20under-employed%20also%20at%205.1%25&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
Australian unemployment is at a 28-year low at 5.1 per cent, according to recent figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). This has prompted debate over whether interest rates should increase &lt;a href="http%3A//www.theage.com.au/news/Business/Jobs-data-fuels-talk-of-May-rate-hikes/2005/04/07/1112815658039.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. However, the number of underemployed still remains high, at 600,000 &lt;a href="http%3A//www.smh.com.au/news/Business/Underemployed-cannot-cure-all-labour-pains/2005/04/08/1112815727731.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; that is, around the same 5.1 per cent figure when compared to Australia's labour market of 10 million .

<h2>Strong job growth</h2>

According to the Employment Minister, Kevin Andrews, 1.6 million jobs had been created over the past nine years, including 330,000 over the last 12 months. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.theage.com.au/news/Business/Jobs-data-fuels-talk-of-May-rate-hikes/2005/04/07/1112815658039.html"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;

A report from his department which described the employment market over the 12 months to August 2004, as one of 'solid growth', said total employment increased by 2.1% over that year.

"Advertised vacancies increased for trade occupations, marginally decreased for professional occupations and decreased for associate professional occupations," reads the October 2004 ♡❤Australian Jobs Update♡❤ report.

"The strongest numerical rises in employment occurred in Health and Community Services (up 60 600), Construction (up 43 400) and Manufacturing (up 40 900) while the strongest rates of growth were in Mining, Personal and Other Services, and Health and Community Services."

<h2>Possible interest rate hike</h2>

Although there is widespread speculation, AMP Capital chief economist Shane Oliver told Australian Associated Press that the strong job market did not necessarily mean that the Reserve Bank of Australia would hike up interest rates. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.theage.com.au/news/Business/Jobs-data-fuels-talk-of-May-rate-hikes/2005/04/07/1112815658039.html"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;

"The labour market is one of the last indicators to turn down, so we've already seen the economy slow down - particularly in the housing sector - and you would think that it is only a matter of time that we'll see a slowing in (jobs)," he said.

"I think the Reserve Bank will probably need to see clear evidence of wages growth coming through to inflation before they move again."

<h2>Many are under-employed</h2>

The still-large under-employed category defined by the ABS includes a wide range of persons &amp;mdash; anyone employed for less than 35 hours a week, willing and available to work additional hours. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.smh.com.au/news/Business/Underemployed-cannot-cure-all-labour-pains/2005/04/08/1112815727731.html"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http%3A//www.ecom.unimelb.edu.au/iaesrwww/wp/wp2004n16.pdf"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;

A study by The Melbourne Institute found in 2001 that one employed person in six is under-employed, with 5 per cent of available worker-hours unutilised &lt;a href="http%3A//www.ecom.unimelb.edu.au/iaesrwww/wp/wp2004n16.pdf"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;. This was associated with part-time employment for females, but with full-time employment for males.

The 2001 study found that part-time workers seeking full-time employment felt negative effects, "not far short of those attributable to unemployment".

<h2>Number of long-term unemployed has increased over past ten years</h2>

Roughly 60% of the half-million-odd eligible for unemployment benefits in February were denoted as ♡❤long-term♡❤ unemployed, according to the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.workplace.gov.au/NR/rdonlyres/2EC71636-15CF-4122-B026-2D953D98372A/0/LMRP_February2005.pdf"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt; Less were long-term unemployed in February than at the same time last year. In 2004 there were 1.43 long-term unemployed for every short-term unemployed, while in 2005 there were 1.34 .

But ten years ago, there were fewer long-term unemployed than short-term, with 1.07 short-term unemployed to every long-termer .

<h1>Panic in Sumatra after new earthquake</h1>
♡❤♡April 10, 2005♡❤♡
People living on the Indonesian island of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASumatra"&gt;Sumatra&lt;/a&gt; have fled their homes after an &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aearthquake"&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt; of magnitude of 6.7 hit the area earlier today. Although the quake was not powerful enough to cause a &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Atsunami"&gt;tsunami&lt;/a&gt;, the event sparked fears of a repeat of the &lt;a href="2004%20Indian%20Ocean%20Tsunami"&gt;December 26 magnitude 9.3 earthquake&lt;/a&gt; in which around 300,000 people died. Today's tremor struck 70 miles southwest of Padang, a city in western Sumatra, yet no damage has been reported so far.

An Indonesia Geophysics and Meteorology Agency official said: "Many people in Padang are panicking. People have left their houses, especially those living on the coast."

The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Honolulu, Hawaii, said in a statement: "Earthquakes of this size sometimes generate local tsunamis that can be destructive along coasts located within a few hundred kilometres of the earthquake epicentre." 

Scientists are cautious that another major earthquake could occur along the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AIndian%20Ocean"&gt;Indian Ocean&lt;/a&gt; faultline, which has seen a number of minor tremors since the December 26 quake. Although most countries have a contingency plan for earthquake related disasters, a tsunami warning system for South Asia will not be ready until the end of 2006.

The former party of apartheid in South Africa, the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20National%20Party%20%28South%20Africa%29"&gt;New National Party&lt;/a&gt; (NNP), has finally been dissolved by a vote of the party's federal council on April 9, 2005. The vote was 88 in favor, 2 against, and 3 abstentions.

This follows a decision under the guidance of party leader &lt;a href="w%3AMarthinus%20van%20Schalkwyk"&gt;Marthinus van Schalkwyk&lt;/a&gt; last year to join forces with the ruling &lt;a href="w%3AAfrican%20National%20Congress"&gt;African National Congress&lt;/a&gt; party (ANC). "The forerunner to the NNP, the National Party, brought development to a section of South Africa but also brought suffering through a system grounded on injustice," said van Schalkwyk.

The NNP was the successor to the National Party, taking the new name in 1997 to distance itself from its apartheid past. The &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Party%20of%20South%20Africa"&gt;National Party&lt;/a&gt; was the governing party of South Africa from 1948 to 1994, and promoted policies of apartheid and the promotion of &lt;a href="w%3AAfrikaner"&gt;Afrikaner&lt;/a&gt; (white South African) culture.

Former South African President &lt;a href="w%3ADe%20Klerk"&gt;Frederik Willem de Klerk&lt;/a&gt;, who oversaw the end of apartheid during his tenure from 1989 to 1994 as its last white president, called for the creation of a new party to take the NNP's place. "I think there is a need to establish something to take the place of the National Party, but hopefully without the historical baggage which the National Party carried and which also played a role in its demise," said de Klerk.

Proportion of the NNP share of the national vote have been steadily dropping since 1994, when it received 20.4% as the National Party in the nation's first free multi-racial elections, to 2004, when it received 1.7%.

Other prominent South African parties include the ANC (African National Congress), ruling party with 69.7% of the 2004 vote; and the Democratic Alliance (DA), a liberal party which is the official opposition party to the ANC, and received 12.4% of the 2004 vote. Until being dissolved the NNP was the fifth largest party in the country.

Concerns have been expressed about the long-term unchecked dominance of the ANC and the possibility for corruption, with Business Monitor International expressing the view that, "While official graft is low by both global and African standards, the blurred
line between the government and the dominant ANC party gives plenty of scope
for abuses." 

Transparency International ranks South Africa at 44th on its list of corrupt countries in its 2004 Corrupt Perceptions Index, ahead of most African nations but behind Botswana (31st) and Tunisia (39th). For comparison, the United States ranks at 17th on the same list.

As many as 116 &lt;a href="w%3ANepal"&gt;Nepalis&lt;/a&gt; have been killed in recent confrontations between &lt;a href="w%3ACommunist%20Party%20of%20Nepal%20%28Maoist%29"&gt;Maoist&lt;/a&gt; guerrillas and government troops, according to recent estimates from multiple sources, including India's ♡❤The Hindu♡❤.

Approximately 113 bodies of Maoist rebels were recovered following a fierce battle between guerrillas and government security forces three days ago. The clash took place 550 kilometers west of Nepal's capital Kathmandu, when rebels attacked an outpost of the Royal Nepalese Army. Three government troops were killed.

Nepal's King &lt;a href="w%3AGyanendra%20of%20Nepal"&gt;Gyanendra&lt;/a&gt; seized power on February 1 for the second time, in what he described as a necessary act to prevent the country from falling to the insurgents. Gyanendra has promised that peace and democratic institutions would be restored within three years; however, he has currently suspended many civil liberties, arrested demonstrators, and used armed soldiers to censor the news media.

Nepal's army is under international scrutiny for potential violations of human rights, and some nations including India and the United Kingdom have suspended aid. The United States is considering revoking its military aid unless the government's emergency regulations are ended.

The United Nations will be sending human rights observers into the country per an agreement signed Monday by Louise Arbour, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, and Ramesh Nath Pandey, Nepalese Foreign Minister. "Breaking the cycle of serious and systematic abuses [by both the government and rebels] will be the first essential step toward achieving peace and reconciliation in Nepal," said Arbour.

As the ♡❤San Francisco Chronicle♡❤ has reported, the rebels have brought about the brutal deaths of countless villagers, causing terror throughout Nepal. More than 11,000 deaths are believed to have been caused during 9 years of violent conflict.

An army commander interviewed by the ♡❤Chronicle♡❤ stated, "We are winning this war," against the rebels. Reflecting on his statement, he immediately retracted this, declaring, "Nobody is winning," he says. "We are killing Nepalese, and they are killing Nepalese."

<h1>China anti-textbook protests grow larger</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=China%20anti-textbook%20protests%20grow%20larger&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="China"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; protests against the publication of a Japanese government textbook continued for a second day in China, (Sunday) as an estimated three thousand protesters marched on the Japanese consulate in &lt;a href="Guangzhou"&gt;Guangzhou&lt;/a&gt;. Thousands of protesters also marched in &lt;a href="Shenzhen"&gt;Shenzhen&lt;/a&gt;, throwing objects at Japanese businesses.

The protesters repeated their demands for a boycott of Japanese goods, to block Japan from obtaining a seat on the &lt;a href="U.N.%20Security%20Council"&gt;U.N. Security Council&lt;/a&gt;, and for Japan to change textbooks which they say whitewash Japan's war atrocities. Protesters burned Japanese flags while singing and shouting anti-Japanese slogans. They also carried anti-Japanese signs along with Chinese flags.
Chinese view the textbook as "whitewashing" the events and actions of Japan to cast them in a more positive light. 

The protests are against the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJapanese%20Society%20for%20History%20Textbook%20Reform"&gt;Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which is publishing a high-school textbook that refers to the Nanjing Massacre as an "incident" (&lt;a href="http%3A//www.wellesley.edu/Polisci/wj/China/Nanjing/nanjing3.html"&gt;translation&lt;/a&gt;) and de-emphasizes the roles of comfort women as well as the contemporary issues surrounding Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's visits to the Yasukuni shrine, in honor of Japanese soldiers. 

The Japanese government has claimed that the demonstrations have an "anti-Japanese sentiment," for which China should apologise.
In &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATokyo"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Japan formally summoned Wang Yi, China's ambassador to Japan, concerning China's actions on Sunday.

"We formally demanded China’s apology and compensation," said Japanese Foreign Minister &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANobutaka%20Machimura"&gt;Nobutaka Machimura&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . He also said that Wang Yi replied "No" when asked for an apology.

While not issuing a formal apology through diplomatic channels, Wang claimed that China did not approve of the violent aspects of the protests.

"The (Chinese) government does not agree with extreme action," he said.

Back in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABeijing"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the ♡❤People's Daily♡❤ reported that Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang deflected blame away from China for the recent downturn in Sino-Japanese relations.

"Japan must adopt an earnest attitude and appropriate ways to deal with major principled issues concerning the feelings of the Chinese people," Qin said. "The Japanese have to do more things conducive to enhancing mutual trust and maintaining the relations between the two countries, rather than doing the reverse," he said.

A tiny piece of rock 4.4 billion years old went on display in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWisconsin"&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUSA"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Sunday for one day only. A jazz band played music, with rocks for percussion, which they said might be appropriate for displaying the bit of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Azircon"&gt;zircon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; crystal, barely two human hairs wide.

The tiny gem was found in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 1984, and analyzed in 2001 by experts, and has led to the reappraisal of early &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEarth"&gt;Earth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Wisconsin%E2%80%93Madison"&gt;University of Wisconsin–Madison&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; geophysicist Professor John Valley said his work proved the crystal could only have formed in a low-temperature environment.

"The whole thing is something that captures your imagination," he told reporters.
"This is our first glimpse into the earliest history of the Earth. The miraculous thing about the crystal is that we've been able to make such wide-ranging inferences about the early Earth." 

The exhibit was under police guard. The tiny sliver will return to Australia with a professor from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACurtin%20University%20of%20Technology"&gt;Curtin University of Technology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APerth"&gt;Perth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who discovered it in 1984. It will go to a museum.

A nationwide alert for consumers to avoid the 'Mama's Smoked Nova Salmon' product in 8-oz. bags was issued by the U.S. &lt;a href="w%3AFood%20and%20Drug%20Administration"&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; (FDA) when the threat of contamination with Listeria monocytogenes was discovered.

Listeria is a bacteria organism which can be serious and sometimes cause fatal infections, particularly in the young, frail or the elderly.

Healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such a high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea. Symptoms vary with the ability of the patient's immune reaction, and could be life-threatening.

Consumers are urged to return the product, individual 8-oz. packages marked: "SELL BY SEP 17 2005 27183", "SELL BY SEP 18 2005 27183". They may also be in shipping cartons labeled: "09/17/05 SELL BY 27183", "09/18/05 SELL BY 27183" to the place of purchase for a full refund. Questions may be directed to the company's recall coordinator at (305) 621-7600 ext 211.

In controversial reporting by the &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;i media, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMoshe%20Katsav"&gt;Moshe Katsav&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the President of Israel, reportedly shook hands with two Mideastern leaders, the &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;ian President &lt;a href="Mohammad%20Khatami"&gt;Mohammad Khatami&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;n President &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABashar%20al-Assad"&gt;Bashar Assad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , during his trip to the Pope's funeral on April 8. If true, it is a notable incident and the first time leaders of the two anti-Zionist nations of Iran and Syria have ever shaken hands with an Israeli leader. 

Syria is still technically in a decades-old state of war with Israel since an end to it was never officially declared. Peace talks between the two countries broke down in March 2000 when Bashar Assad's father, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHafez%20Assad"&gt;Hafez Assad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , rejected a peace proposal of former &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; President &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Clinton"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Since Hafez Assad's death in June 2000, peace talks have not resumed. 

Iran has had no diplomatic relations with either Israel or the United States since their &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIranian%20revolution"&gt;Islamic Revolution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 1979.

The three leaders were seated near each other while observing the funeral by a coincidence of their alphabetical listing. "The Syrian president sat in the chair behind me ... we exchanged smiles and shook hands," said Katsav, according to the website of Israel's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMaariv"&gt;Maariv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; newspaper.

Katsav also claims he later shook hands and spoke with Khatami and Assad during the traditional Christian service exchange of peace. Katsav and Khatami, both born in the Iranian city of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AYazd"&gt;Yazd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , share the Persian &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APersian%20language"&gt;Farsi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; language. Katsav reportedly said when leaving, "the Iranian president held his hand out to me. I shook his hand and greeted him in Farsi."

Upon Khatami's return to Iran, he denied the handshake ever occurred, saying “These allegations are false like all the other allegations made by the Israeli media and I have not had any meeting with a personality from the Zionist regime,” according to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIslamic%20Republic%20News%20Agency"&gt;Islamic Republic News Agency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . "As reiterated time and again, we do not morally and logically recognize Israel which was created based on force and usurpation."

He continued with "[Iran] would not do anything against the Middle East peace plans ...but the world should know that as long as the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people are not recognized, these peace plans will not achieve anything'."

According to the ♡❤Jerusalem Post♡❤, a member of Assad's entourage did confirm on Friday night that a handshake with Katsav occurred, and reported this quote by a Syrian Army Radio source saying "the gesture was an expression of manners and has no political significance." Katsav also told Israeli ♡❤Channel 2 News♡❤ on Friday evening that his handshakes with Assad and Khatami were merely polite gestures and had no implications for the relationships between their countries.

&lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARomania"&gt;Romania's&lt;/a&gt; Ministry of European Integration has made public the text of the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union's&lt;/a&gt; Accession Treaty with &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARomania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABulgaria"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt;, making it available on its website. The text of the treaty is available freely, in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARomanian%20language"&gt;Romanian&lt;/a&gt;, at &lt;a href="http%3A//www.mie.ro/tratat_aderare/Romana/cuprins.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

The Accession Treaty, which is due to be voted by the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEuropean%20Parliament"&gt;European Parliament&lt;/a&gt; on April 13 and signed on April 25, is the legal document facilitating Romania and Bulgaria's accession to the EU, which, according to the treaty, will take place on January 1, 2007.

The treaty's content has been posted online in order to inform Romanians of the costs, standards and responsibilities of European Union accession. The text was published after the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEuropean%20Commission"&gt;European Commission&lt;/a&gt; asked for Romania and Bulgaria to better inform their citizens of what EU accession actually means. Bulgaria similarly made available the content of the treaty, in the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABulgarian%20language"&gt;Bulgarian language&lt;/a&gt;, in early April.

Once the Accession Treaty is signed, Romania and Bulgaria will have to withdraw from the Central European Free Trade Agreement, as they will be integrated into the EU-wide free trade area. Additionally, from April 25, the two countries will send observers to the European Parliament and will be able to participate in other European Union institutions and events as observers.

When the two countries join in 2007, the European Union will have 27 members in total and more than 480 million citizens. The timetable for accession, and the implementation of the treaty, however, will be in jeopardy if the European Parliament fails to approve the accession of the two countries on April 13, or if the two countries are deemed unprepared for accession by the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEuropean%20Commission"&gt;European Commission&lt;/a&gt;, in which case the so-called safeguard clause will come into effect, postponing accession by one year.

The 109th running of the world's oldest annual marathon, the Boston Marathon, will start in Hopkinton, Massachusetts, at noon on Monday, April 18, 2005. The marathon, one of the few marathons that requires entrants to run below certain times in another marathon to enter, is "tough for the runners" because of the late start time, the Monday start date, and the remote start location, according to Don Allison of Cool Running. Despite the entry requirements and hardships, the marathon is expected to draw over 20,000 runners, 500,000 spectators, and 1000 members of the press.

Race director Dave McGillivray told the Boston Globe that, "We're not the fastest course, we're not the biggest field, we're not the richest purse, but we're the most prestigious." The Globe notes that the Chicago marathon is known for faster times, a purse 50% larger than Boston's, and a field twice as large. Still, in Boston the winning man and woman each receive $100,000 in prize money.

The Boston Marathon is know for the set of 4 hills that runners hit in Newton, a suburb west of Boston. The fourth hill, known as Heartbreak Hill, occurs at the 21-mile mark.

<h1>Romanian government to strengthen laws against tax evasion</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Romanian%20government%20to%20strengthen%20laws%20against%20tax%20evasion&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARomania"&gt;Romanian&lt;/a&gt; government has drafted legislation pertaining to &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Atax%20fraud"&gt;tax evasion&lt;/a&gt; that makes it a criminal offence on the same level as crimes against individuals. Developed with the aid of Romania's business community, the new law is expected to reduce corruption and tax evasion. According to the new law, the maximum jail term for tax evasion will be boosted up to 20 years. This sentence, however, will only be passed in circumstances of large-scale fraud. For evasion of up to the equivalent of 10,000 &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aeuro"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt;, the punishment will be either a fine or up to 2 years in prison. For tax fraud of up to 500,000 euro, the term will be extended to 2-8 years in prison. It is only for those whose tax evasion exceeds 1 million euro that the jail term will range between 10 and 20 years.

In the same package of legislation, the government approved several changes to banckruptcy law, which makes it easier for businesses to file for bankruptcy. The new laws are expected to make Romania's business environment cleaner, resulting in more foreign investment, less corruption and more revenue for the government.

At the start of the year, the Romanian government introduced a new &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aflat%20tax"&gt;flat tax&lt;/a&gt; system for Romania, in which the tax rate is 19% for both personal income and corporate profit. This has led Romania to have one of the most liberal tax policies in Europe. The lower rate of tax has already reduced fiscal evasion to a significant extent because more people and businesses are encouraged to pay the tax. However, in order to further reduce the grey economy in Romania, advisers said at the start of the year that the government must also back this up with tougher legislation against tax evasion. Previously, Romania's tax evasion laws were fairly lax, leading to quite a significant extent of tax fraud. Now, with the new, highly-publicised tax evasion laws, it is expected that the risk of getting prosecuted for not paying an already-low tax rate will force many businesses out of the black market into the legal economy.

A &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARomania"&gt;Romanian&lt;/a&gt; been found and declared safe, according to the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Romanian, which has as of yet only been identified by his last name, Dinca, had been kidnapped by soldiers dressed as civilians.

Dinca was the president of Mega Star Congo Company, a Romanian enterprise operating in the DRC. After his kidnapping, one of his employees said that his boss had been kidnapped by military subordinates of a Congolese general who had been watching and following Dinca for the previous two weeks. Other employees confirmed this, saying that Dinca had been watched by groups of soldiers in his home at Gombe. The Romanian Foreign Ministry said that the kidnapping has occurred due to a "private commercial dispute."

Le Phare, a Congolese newspaper, reported that, "This kidnapping, which undermines the actions of the head of state and members of the government members, raises a big question mark, both for the authorities and for the army commanders. If the insecurity is due to the soldiers, it is worrying that such a climate is maintained by superior officers and generals."

The Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that they would continue to try and protect Romanian businessmen who invest in the DRC and prevent similar incidents in the future.

A gathering of more than a thousand medical researchers in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , has been told that &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aarsenic"&gt;arsenic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThalidomide"&gt;Thalidomide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;mdash; banned in the 1960s after being linked to gross birth abnormalities &amp;mdash; held hope as a basis for new treatments, extending the lives of patients with an so-far incurable bone marrow cancer, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Amultiple%20myeloma"&gt;multiple myeloma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Diagnosis of the disease has increased by 45% in Australia since 1992. It is the most lethal form of cancer, and the topic of discussion, at the 10th International Myeloma Workshop, continuing until the 16th of April.

The two treatments had advantages over existing &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Achemotherapy"&gt;chemotherapy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; treatments, including lessened side-effects, and reducing the need for chemo- and radiotherapy. They may also be usable to treat other illnesses. Both were still under test.

"The development of arsenic dates back many years when it was used for lowering the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-forced-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABlood%20count%23Manual%20blood%20count"&gt;blood counts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in patients, even at the turn of the century," Professor Miles Prince, of the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, told ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Associated%20Press"&gt;Australian Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ for the 10th International Myeloma Workshop.

"Subsequently [arsenic] was used in China since the 1960s for treating certain forms of Leukaemia," he said.

It could be used to induce the cell to "commit suicide".

"The side effects with Thalidomide are much less than with chemotherapy because it's not damaging innocent bystander cells - so you don't get low blood counts, you don't lose your hair, you don't get a sore mouth," he said.

"It was originally thought to work because [Thalidomide] blocks the blood vessel growth in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATumor"&gt;tumours&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and that is still true, but the research that we've done has shown that one of its major causes of action is to stimulate [ &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aimmune%20system"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ] &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AT%20cell"&gt;T-cells&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; which are directly against the tumour, and these T-cells help patients with myeloma fight their disease," Professor Douglas Joshua, head of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHematology"&gt;Haemotology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Prince%20Alfred%20Hospital"&gt;Royal Prince Alfred Hospital&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in Sydney, told Australian radio.

"There's no doubt that with the new combinations of drugs - we've got Thalidomide, the sons of Thalidomide, Velcade and arsenic - we're adding years onto patient's lives and certainly it could add up to five years or more," according to Prof. Prince.

Anna Ayala, the woman who claims to have found the notorious "chili finger" at a outlet in , has filed &lt;a href="w%3ALawsuit"&gt;lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; against other businesses, according to researchers at the &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;♡❤Associated Press♡❤&lt;/a&gt;. Her previous court battles included the national &lt;a href="w%3AEl%20Pollo%20Loco"&gt;El Pollo Loco&lt;/a&gt; chicken-chain, a previous employer, and even &lt;a href="w%3AGeneral%20Motors"&gt;General Motors&lt;/a&gt;.

Ayala successfully won her suit for medical expenses against El Pollo Loco, after her daughter Genesis contracted &lt;a href="w%3ASalmonellosis"&gt;salmonella poisoning&lt;/a&gt; from eating at the restaurant. However, Ayala lost another suit in 2000 claiming that a wheel fell off her car.

Ayala's original account of the incident spoke "emotionally and with disgust" to the ♡❤San Jose Mercury News♡❤ when she described it to the paper.

"Lies, lies, lies, that's all I am hearing. They should look at Wendy's. What are they hiding? Why are we being victimized again and again?" Ayala recently told ♡❤The Associated Press♡❤. Ayala is now in her Las Vegas home, avoiding reporters.

"It doesn't prove anything," family spokesman Ken Bono told the &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco%20Chronicle"&gt;♡❤San Francisco Chronicle♡❤&lt;/a&gt;. "My mom has 10 lawsuits. A lot of people have lawsuits. Why would she sue for money? She has plenty of money," he said.

Nick Muyo, a spokesman for the San Jose Police department, said not to expect new information in the case for at least a week.

"We just want to step back and take a deep breath," Muyo told ♡❤Knight Ridder Newspapers♡❤. "From a law enforcement point of view, once you establish it is a human finger, you have to wonder is this a case of industrial accident or is this a case of unreported homicide," he said.

Las Vegas police searched Anna Ayala's home on Wednesday, retrieving a cooler and other effects from her home, such as a makeup case.

<h3>Aftermath</h3>
Despite the incident, which has dramatically reduced sales at &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20California"&gt;Northern California&lt;/a&gt; Wendy's outlets, die-hard Wendy's fans are still turning up for lunch, even at the outlet where the finger was found, at 1405 Monterey Highway, just south of downtown San Jose.

"We've eaten here for years," a police officer told the ♡❤San Francisco Chronicle♡❤ under the condition that he remain anonymous. "They're very nice people. When we work Spartan Stadium, we always eat here," he said.

San Jose City Council candidate Andrew Diaz still eats the chili. And he witnessed the finger discovery.

"I walked away real slow," Diaz told the ♡❤San Francisco Chronicle♡❤. "I didn't want any commotion," he said.

&lt;a href="w%3APublic%20Broadcasting%20Service"&gt;PBS&lt;/a&gt; has recently decided it was time their &lt;a href="w%3ACookie%20Monster"&gt;Cookie Monster&lt;/a&gt; was sent on a diet. &lt;a href="w%3ASesame%20Street"&gt;Sesame Street&lt;/a&gt;'s cookie-loving Muppet icon developed a sudden interest in vegetables, as part of PBS's drive to instill a healthy lifestyle in children.

The blue furry monster's makeover comes as part of a larger plan, introducing additional characters as well. Intended new cast members include talking eggplants and carrots, among others.

According to the ♡❤Sesame Street Muppet Bios♡❤, "This season, Cookie Monster learns a lot about health and nutrition. Hoots the Owl explains in a song that 'A Cookie is a Sometimes Food,' and he joins &lt;a href="w%3AWyclef%20Jean"&gt;Wyclef Jean&lt;/a&gt; in a rap song, 'Healthy Food'."

Every other day, health will be the focus of the shows. In addition, every other day there will be segments dealing with health/nutrition. There will be a "Health Moment" at the top of every show featuring special guests, celebrities and Sesame Street characters.

The producers of the show insist that they are not asking small children to go on a diet.

"We would never use the word 'diet' with pre-schoolers," a spokeswoman told ♡❤The New Zealand Herald♡❤.

<h1>German Wikipedia DVD on P2P networks</h1>
♡❤♡, ♡❤♡ The German Wikipedia DVD is a popular item on European FTP sites.

The DVD project with &lt;a href="w%3ADirectmedia"&gt;Directmedia publishing GmbH&lt;/a&gt; was built from the March 3, 2005 &lt;a href="http%3A//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3AWikipedia-Distribution%23Download"&gt;database archive&lt;/a&gt;, and has been packaged as ISO image files to be made available online.

When the news was &lt;a href="http%3A//www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/58428"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; @ heise online, &lt;a href="w%3AFTP"&gt;FTP requests&lt;/a&gt; to the University of Erlangen quickly overloaded the 622mbit connection server. The average load is still above 482.39 compared to 20 before the announcement.

In the afternoon, the FTP server &lt;a href="w%3Ade%3ABelnet"&gt;Belnet&lt;/a&gt; joined in also hosting these files which can also be downloaded by using the peer-to-peer file transfer software &lt;a href="w%3ABittorrent"&gt;Bittorrent&lt;/a&gt;.

The DVD image is 2.7 Gigabytes in size, and includes browsing software for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. The download is large, but is also available from DirectMedia for about &lt;a href="w%3AEuro"&gt;€&lt;/a&gt;10 on DVD - although their initial printing of 10,000 sold out within 3 days.

Stimulated by the success of this DVD project, several English news services have raised the question of when an English DVD of Wikipedia will be available.

&lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; has announced a special daily video feed of its two upcoming missions. One of the &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Discovery"&gt;Space Shuttle Discovery&lt;/a&gt;. The coverage, which began earlier on Monday on the program, "The &lt;a href="w%3ASTS-114"&gt;STS-114&lt;/a&gt; Return to Flight Gallery," will air daily at 1 to 3 p.m. EDT featuring video related to the launch of the Discovery.

The second mission is Expedition 10. This will send replacement Russians to the ICC--&lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Space%20Station"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt;--crew.

Commander &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASergei%20K.%20Krikalev"&gt;Sergei Krikalev&lt;/a&gt; and Flight Engineer and NASA Station Science Officer &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AJohn%20L.%20Phillips"&gt;John Phillips&lt;/a&gt;, the crew of Expedition 11, are scheduled to launch from the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABaikonur%20Cosmodrome"&gt;Baikonur Cosmodrome&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AKazakhstan"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt;, at 8:46 p.m. EDT, April 14. 

&lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Space%20Agency"&gt;European Space Agency&lt;/a&gt; (ESA) Astronaut &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARoberto%20Vittori"&gt;Roberto Vittori&lt;/a&gt; of Italy will be joining them aboard their &lt;a href="w%3ASoyuz%20spacecraft"&gt;Soyuz spacecraft&lt;/a&gt;. Vittori is flying to the Station for eight days of scientific research under a
commercial agreement between ESA and the &lt;a href="w%3ARussian%20Aviation%20and%20Space%20Agency"&gt;Russian Federal Space Agency&lt;/a&gt;.

The new video feed is expected to include a rotation of video items including full length interviews with each of the orbiter Discovery’s crew members. 

The STS-114 crew includes Commander &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEileen%20Collins"&gt;Eileen Collins&lt;/a&gt;, Pilot &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AJames%20M.%20Kelly"&gt;Jim Kelly&lt;/a&gt;, Mission Specialists Soichi Noguchi, Steve Robinson, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AAndy%20Thomas"&gt;Andy Thomas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AWendy%20B.%20Lawrence"&gt;Wendy Lawrence&lt;/a&gt; and Charlie Camarda. This will be the first mission flown since the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Colombia"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt; accident in February 2003.

The mission will link Discovery to the International Space Station in the first of two test flights to verify new inspection and repair techniques. It will also resupply the ISS with necessities.

In addition to the NASA TV channel, the programs will air on NASA’s Internet service, http://www.nasa.gov/ntv, and be available on other uplink facilities.

Shuttle Discovery has a possible launch window from May 15 to June 3, this year.

♡❤Sahara♡❤ is described as an adventure movie with plenty of fun. McConaughey plays a tanned and fit traveler searching for a long lost &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AAmerican%20Civil%20War"&gt;U.S. Civil War&lt;/a&gt; battleship, filled with gold coins, and finds love in the process.

<h1>Tom DeLay raises Republican hackles as ethics charges dominate news</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Tom%20DeLay%20raises%20Republican%20hackles%20as%20ethics%20charges%20dominate%20news&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

As &lt;a href="Tom%20DeLay"&gt;Tom DeLay&lt;/a&gt;'s (Republican member of the &lt;a href="U.S.%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;U.S. House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;), alleged ethical lapses began to dominate American political news stories and the Sunday talk shows, have led some &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARepublican"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; members of the Majority Leader’s own party to question the reasoning for his refusal to account for his actions or resign.

Last year, in a glimpse of problems yet to surface, the Republican head of the &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="US%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20House%20Committee%20on%20Standards%20of%20Official%20Conduct"&gt;Committee on Standards of Official Conduct&lt;/a&gt;, or "House Ethics Committee", presided over three admonitions that included offering to endorse the candidacy of a political lawmaker’s son in exchange for votes on legislation. The ethics complaints were originally filed by Democratic Rep. &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Bell%20%28politician%29"&gt;Chris Bell&lt;/a&gt; of Texas on June 15, 2004, and began to heat up in the months prior to last year's elections.

A Texas grand jury is taking a hard look at Delay’s fund raising practices, and has already indicted three of his close associates. Last week the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AWashington%20Post"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; reported that Mr. DeLay took a trip to Moscow in 1997, financed by lobbyists of the Russian Government.

Delay’s representative, Dan Allen, told reporters "Congressman DeLay's effective leadership to build and strengthen the House majority is exactly the reason he is being targeted by liberal groups funded by George Soros."

But &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AChristopher%20Shays"&gt;Christopher Shays&lt;/a&gt;, a Republican from &lt;a href="Connecticut"&gt;Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;, a Republican moderate, told the Associated Press that DeLay’s "conduct is hurting the Republican Party" and "hurting any Republican who is up for re-election [in 2006]."

The news agency reported that DeLay would look forward to meeting the charges with the ethics committee in a sit-down and blamed all of his problems on House Democrats.

&lt;a href="US%20Senate"&gt;Senator&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Chris%20Dodd"&gt;Chris Dodd&lt;/a&gt;, a Democrat from Connecticut, advised his Republican colleagues strongly to “Be careful about how closely you embrace Mr. DeLay, as long as he's there, he's going to become a pretty good target." His remarks were nationally televised on ABC TV.

Those Republicans working with the Majority Leader said his ethics are only a problem to Democrats trying to regain power in the House. But the Ethics Committee’s membership is equally divided between Republicans and Democrats.

Other Republicans are starting to get jittery about their reelection hopes if DeLay is allowed to retain power.

"Tom's conduct is hurting the Republican Party, is hurting this Republican majority and it is hurting any Republican who is up for re-election," Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., told the Associated Press after making similar comments at community meetings in his home district this weekend.

He told reporters he thinks DeLay should step down.

The third-ranking Republican in the Senate, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARick%20Santorum"&gt;Rick Santorum&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Pennsylvania"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, said DeLay needs to “clear the air.” But he thinks everything done by DeLay was “according to the law.”

"I think he has to come forward and lay out what he did and why he did it and let the people then judge for themselves," he said on ABC's This Week, a Sunday political talk program. "Now you may not like some of the things he's done, that’s for the people of his district to decide, whether they want to approve that kind of behavior."

Santorum faces reelection in 2006.

<h3>State and Federal investigations of Tom DeLay</h3>
DeLay is under investigation by the Travis County (Texas) district attorney, Democrat &lt;a href="w%3ARonnie%20Earle"&gt;Ronnie Earle&lt;/a&gt;, who has already indicted three members of DeLay's organization, Texans for a Republican Majority Political Action Committee (TRMPAC), on charges of &lt;a href="w%3Amoney%20laundering"&gt;money laundering&lt;/a&gt; and accepting illegal campaign contributions. 

DeLay and his associates are alleged to have created a front group to launder money obtained through this illegal method. The District attorney believes he is enforcing the law enacted by the Texas lawmakers.

DeLay and his supporters contended that this investigation and the indictments were politically motivated maneuvers by the Democratic Travis County, Texas District Attorney &lt;a href="w%3ARonnie%20Earle"&gt;Ronnie Earle&lt;/a&gt;. Earle has been characterized as a controversial and colorful political figure with a history of pursuing unconventional indictments against elected officials including Sen. &lt;a href="w%3AKay%20Bailey%20Hutchison"&gt;Kay Bailey Hutchison&lt;/a&gt;. However, his record shows that he has indicted more Democrats than Republicans.

Federal investigators are probing a lobbyist, &lt;a href="Jack%20Abramoff"&gt;Jack Abramoff&lt;/a&gt;, another DeLay associate, for bilking millions of dollars from Native American casino operators for promises of congressional action to support their businesses. Abramoff and others may have underwritten overseas travel for the Majority Leader, which is a violation of law.

<h3>Reactions to intervention in Terri Schiavo case</h3>
DeLay has taken on the nation’s independent judiciary, particularly those who disagreed with him on the reinsertion of the feeding tube for Terri Schiavo, a brain damaged Florida woman who died on March 31. Reports that he pulled the life support from his own father, when he was fatally injured in the 1980’s, didn’t deter him.

"The time will come for the men responsible for this to answer for their behavior," DeLay said of the judges.

Asked what his associates think of DeLay’s latest slew of bad news, spokesman Dan Allen replied, "Members were very supportive through the week last week and going into the weekend."

The Bush administration said that DeLay has not become the political liability that Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Mississippi, became in 2002.

<h3>Loyalty has a price</h3>
Both Chris Shays and Joel Hefley, a Republican from Colorado, the past chairman of the House ethics committee who sanctioned DeLay three times, have signed a resolution, crafted by Democrats, that would end some of the rules changes that their own party pushed through to help DeLay only three months ago. DeLay voted for the changes to cover his actions as well.

Hefley said "A lot of folks mention quietly that they are concerned about it. On the other hand, you have a lot of members standing up and pledging their undying support for Mr. DeLay,"

Eleven years after the Republicans swept power in the Congress from the Democrats, they seem more intent on protecting DeLay than keeping the “Contract with America,” according to critics. They say “that is the corrupting influence of power.”

DeWayne Wickham of USA Today asks, “How will voters respond to this breach of the Contract?” The next federal elections will take place in November of 2006.

A group of 13 students from &lt;a href="w%3AAntioch%20University"&gt;Antioch New England Graduate School&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AKeene%2C%20New%20Hampshire"&gt;Keene&lt;/a&gt;, New Hampshire, USA, were detained by security officers as they photographed an &lt;a href="w%3AExxon%20Mobil"&gt;ExxonMobil&lt;/a&gt; chemical plant in &lt;a href="w%3ABaton%20Rouge%2C%20Louisiana"&gt;Baton Rouge, Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;. The students were accompanied by two professors and an officer from the Louisiana Attorney General's office. The officer, Willie Fontenot, was subsequently asked to resign from his position at the Attorney General's office.

Mr. Fontenot has issued a response, provided to by Steve Case, a professor present at the incident. Fontenot writes,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
♡❤"Last week, I was asked by Attorney General Charles C. Foti, Jr. to either retire or run the risk of being fired. No specifics were given to me explaining this decision by the AG. I have always understood that, as an unclassified civil servant, I served at the pleasure of the AG and that I could be dismissed at any time and for no reason. Because of my age, health issues, and investment of twenty-seven years in the state system, I decided early retirement was the best option for me."♡❤
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The full text of Fontenot's statement is reproduced &lt;a href="Visiting%20students%20detained%20in%20Louisiana%2C%20USA%2C%20while%20photographing%20ExxonMobil%20chemical%20plant/Notes"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

According to a press release from Antioch, the group was initially detained by two off-duty police officers who were under the employ of ExxonMobil but dressed in their police uniforms. The officers were shortly joined by two other security officers who were employed by ExxonMobil. When asked what reports the officers intended to file, "the off-duty sheriff's department officer refused to answer, and instead responded aggressively that he was going to call in 'homeland security' people who would detain the group into the night," said the press release. In the end, the group was detained for "more than an hour."

One of the professors, Abigail Abrash Walton told the Keene Sentinel that one of the officers, "aggressively told us that he’d be calling in the Homeland Security people, whatever that meant, and to expect to be with them all night."

The Keene Sentinel reports that the students were visiting the area because, "Exxon was said to be buying up houses and paying to relocate their owners for various reasons, including that people were allegedly getting sick because of pollution." The other course instructor, Steve Chase, was quoted in the Sentinel as saying that, "Our objection was not that police officers or even corporate security guards would stop and ask us what we were doing. That seemed totally fair. But lies were told, threats were made and the idea was to intimidate."

The Sentinel noted that an ExxonMobil spokesperson, Stephanie Cargile, stated that, “We believe our ExxonMobil Security personnel and the off-duty East Baton Rouge Sheriff police officers acted professionally and cordially to Mr. Fontenot and the Antioch students.” The venue in which the statement was made was not mentioned by the Sentinel; thus far, the report has not been corroborated by Wikinews.

<h1>Child killed by family dog</h1>
♡❤♡April 12, 2005♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

In what authorities call a terrible tragedy, a four-year-old boy was killed Sunday afternoon by the family dog. The &lt;a href="w%3AOrange%20County%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Orange County, Virginia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt; boy was playing in his back yard while their dog, a &lt;a href="w%3ARottweiler"&gt;Rottweiler&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3AGerman%20Shepherd%20Dog"&gt;German Shepherd&lt;/a&gt; mix, was chained to a stake.

The parents of the boy were home when the mauling occurred, but there were no direct eye witnesses to the attack that took place in the Placid Pines &lt;a href="w%3AMobile%20home"&gt;mobile home&lt;/a&gt; park. County Sheriff C.G. Feldman said, "We'll probably never know what provoked the attack.” he told the ♡❤Associated Press♡❤, “The boy had grown up with the dog."

A &lt;a href="w%3ACBS"&gt;♡❤CBS6♡❤&lt;/a&gt; broadcast said investigators saw no signs of parental negligence, and the boy was their only child. No charges against the parents were filed. The dog was euthanised Monday.

Sheriff Feldman stressed there were no similarities or connection with an earlier case of an elderly woman killed in an attack by 3 &lt;a href="w%3Apit%20bull"&gt;pit bulls&lt;/a&gt; in the nearby county of &lt;a href="w%3ASpotsylvania%20County%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Spotsylvania&lt;/a&gt; just over a month ago.

Melbourne, AUSTRALIA – The Australian Department of Immigration (&lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Immigration%20and%20Multicultural%20and%20Indigenous%20Affairs"&gt;DIMIA&lt;/a&gt;) today denied issuing a banned drug to immigration detainees, either in Australia or on &lt;a href="w%3ANauru%20detention%20centre"&gt;Nauru&lt;/a&gt;. But the Asylum Seeker Resource Center (ASRC) said in a press release yesterday that a woman detained here was administered the drug, until advocates called the Minister's office recently to have it stopped.

"It took a phone call to the Minister's office to stop the administration of [Vioxx]," says Pamela Curr of the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre (ASRC) "Inadequate care for asylum seekers is so normalised in the detention centres that the doctors contracted by the detention system continued to administer a banned drug."

Dr Graham, a US whistleblower influential in getting the drug banned, has described that the painkiller and anti-arthritic &lt;a href="w%3ARofecoxib"&gt;Vioxx&lt;/a&gt;, banned on September 30, caused up to 160,000 heart attacks and strokes, and 27,785 deaths from heart ailments from 1999 to 2003. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6520630/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

DIMIA this afternoon repeated its claims published in this morning's ♡❤Age♡❤, that the drug has not been prescribed in its detention system since sometime before the ban was even made, and "no detainees at Nauru were taking the medication".

According to DIMIA, the drug was withdrawn from use at Nauru last September, and doctors at other detention centers around Australia were directed on October 1 to stop prescribing Vioxx. All stockpiles of the Vioxx had been destroyed when it was withdrawn.

The ASRC says the International Organisation of Migration (&lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Organization%20for%20Migration"&gt;IOM&lt;/a&gt;), who "run the camps under orders and with funding from DIMIA", made the same claim in January 2005. Refugee advocates had emailed the IOM, believing at the time that Vioxx was still being prescribed.

A 33-year old visitor to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, named Wen Hao Zhao from Sydney, Australia, was arrested at the &lt;a href="w%3ACapitol%20building"&gt;Capitol building&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, after he was observed by police standing in a "statue-like pose" and carrying two suitcases. 

When confronted by officers of the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.uscapitolpolice.gov/"&gt;United States Capitol Police&lt;/a&gt; (USCP) who were called to the scene at 12:45 p.m. EST, he is reported to have been unresponsive to questioning. "He only would say at first that he wanted to speak to &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt;," according to USCP Chief Terrance W. Gainer. Some reports suggest that the man was limited or unresponsive in his use of English.

The West Lawn area next to the Capitol building and an adjacent part of 1st Street was evacuated and tourists were briefly prevented from entering the building on the possibility that the suitcases may have contained a bomb. 

Authorities X-rayed the bags and examined them for over 3 hours. One bag was found to contain only clothing. The other bag, which apparently was thought to contain wiring which might belong to an explosive device, was destroyed on-site with a &lt;a href="w%3Awater%20cannon"&gt;water cannon&lt;/a&gt;; after which, the bag was found to have contained only common items such as a CD player, batteries, and a watch. 

Zhao was arrested at 1:45 p.m. EST without resistance on charges of disorderly conduct; other more serious charges could be filed. However, Allen Doody of &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Bureau%20of%20Immigration%20and%20Customs%20Enforcement"&gt;U.S. Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement&lt;/a&gt; (ICE) has indicated plans to deport Zhao back to Australia within a few days without charges. "We do not plan to charge him," Doody said.

Zhao is dual-nationality Chinese-Australian, who entered the US legally on his Australian passport less than a week ago.

Everything seemed alright on &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKLM"&gt;KLM ♡❤Royal Dutch Airlines♡❤&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 747 flight ♡❤KL685♡❤ en-route to Mexico, Friday, April 8 &amp;mdash; until the captain hailed &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; flight control for permission to pass over U.S. airspace and permission was denied. Little did he know, the names of two passengers on board had been linked by Mexican authorities to a U.S. Department of Homeland Security watchlist, who then contacted U.S. authorities.

Attempts were made to divert and have the passengers disembark in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , but ultimately this failed &amp;mdash; and left without an alternative route, the plane was forced to return to its port of origin, Amsterdam &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASchiphol%20Airport"&gt;Schiphol Airport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;mdash; in the Netherlands.

Flight KL685 carried 287 passengers and 15 horses, all of whom had to put up with a day's delay, and among the passengers, ♡❤Frederic Hennekens♡❤, a lawyer from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAntwerp"&gt;Antwerp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Hennekens later made an appearance on the &lt;a href="The%20Netherlands"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt; behind-the-news television show ♡❤♡NOVA♡❤♡, offering his personal experience on the matter.

The KLM at first denied this had happened, but later affirmed this when journalists pressed the matter at Hennekens' request.

Hennekens said the flight went well initially, they were ahead of schedule by an hour at the time the captain announced that entry to U.S. airspace had been denied. No reason was given to the pilots, and as a consequence the passengers were left in the dark as well, being told only that they had to turn back to Amsterdam.

Three officials in all &amp;mdash; including one of the cockpit crew and a ticketing officer upon return &amp;mdash; told Hennekens that the passenger list given to the U.S. authorities had been checked too late. This is in contrast to KLM's official response Monday, April 11.
♡❤NOVA♡❤♡s correspondent ♡❤Twan Huys♡❤ reported from New York, having spoken with the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Homeland%20Security"&gt;United States Department of Homeland Security&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . He said that according to the department the first warning that something was wrong with the plane did not originate with the pilots or the KLM, it came from the Mexican officials, per the U.S.-Mexican treaty on passenger lists.
According to the report the department also said that the KLM is aware of this "passengers watchlist" or "no-fly list", and blame the airline for not checking the list properly at Schiphol Airport.

The two people on the list who were denied entry were not apprehended on their return to Europe in either the United Kingdom or The Netherlands. The Dutch government said that these people were not on the European version of the "no-fly list," and as such were left alone. Inquiries are presently being held by both Dutch and American governments, trying to ascertain where communication broke down, and how to avoid situations like this in the future.

Tralliance will operate the new .travel domain and Employ Media will operate the .jobs. domain. Registration will start in a couple of months. Prices have yet to been determined.

.jobs was created for the use of personnel businesses, .travel for the travel industry, and .eu will be used by organizations based in the European Union.

ICANN has also entered into negotiations with registries for .cat, .post and .mobi domains.

The ICANN, established by the U.S. Department of Commerce in 1998, is a non-profit corporation responsible for the technical coordination of the Internet through the assignment of &lt;a href="w%3Adomain%20name"&gt;domain names&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AIP%20address"&gt;IP addresses&lt;/a&gt;.

A National Academy of Sciences &lt;a href="http%3A//www.nap.edu/html/ge_foods/ge-foods-reportbrief.pdf"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; (.pdf) last year said that while the milk and meat from cloned animals would not likely make anyone sick, more research should be performed. Now, a new US-Japan study published in the April 11 online issue of the &lt;a href="w%3AProceedings%20of%20the%20National%20Academy%20of%20Sciences"&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt; says that milk and meat from cloned cattle does indeed appear to meet industry standards and appears to be safe for human consumption.

As &lt;a href="http%3A//news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4435159.stm"&gt;BBC News reports&lt;/a&gt;, the scientists, led by &lt;a href="http%3A//web.uconn.edu/crb/yang.htm"&gt;Professor Jerry Yang&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Connecticut, compared the produce from two beef and four dairy clones, all derived from a single &lt;a href="w%3AHolstein%20%28cattle%29"&gt;Holstein&lt;/a&gt; dairy cow and a single Japanese black bull, with the produce from normal animals of similar age and breed.

The meat was analysed against more than 100 physiological, tissue and cellular components, while the milk was analysed for protein, fat and other variables. No significant differences between the produce of cloned and normal cattle were found. Higher levels of fat and fatty acids were found in the cloned cow meat, but they still fell within beef industry standards.

While the study showed the cloned produce to be within the range approved for human consumption, the scientists stressed that the research was still in its early stages. Their findings, they said, provide "guidelines" for further research with larger numbers of clones from different genetic backgrounds.

Cloning livestock may one day increase yields by copying those animals that are especially productive and especially resistant to disease.

"The milking production levels in the US are three to four times higher than levels in China; maybe even five times or more compared to cows in India and some other countries," Professor Jerry Yang told BBC News. "Therefore cloning could offer technology for duplicating superior farm animals. However, all the products from these cloned animals must be safe for human consumption. ...and it is a major issue for scientists to provide a scientific basis for the data and information to address this question."

As &lt;a href="http%3A//www.usatoday.com/news/health/2005-04-11-cloned-beef_x.htm"&gt;USA Today reports&lt;/a&gt;, there is currently no law governing the sale of meat or milk from the estimated 1,000 to 2,000 cloned farm animals in the USA. But since 2003, the US &lt;a href="w%3AFood%20and%20Drug%20Administration"&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; (FDA) has asked producers to voluntarily keep the meat and milk of these animals, and that of their offspring, out of the food supply.

&lt;a href="http%3A//www.wired.com/news/medtech/0%2C1286%2C67175%2C00.html%3Ftw%3Dwn_tophead_2"&gt;Wired News reports&lt;/a&gt; that companies like &lt;a href="http%3A//www.viagen.com"&gt;ViaGen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http%3A//www.cyagra.com"&gt;Cyagra&lt;/a&gt;, which offer livestock-cloning services, have also been waiting for several years for a final say from the FDA.

"For the United States agricultural industry, (cloning) can reduce the number of cows necessary for milking," said Jerry Yang "They can have a pleasant environment and produce even more milk." He also said that cloning cattle from the United States, where genetic breeding is more advanced, could save developing countries 50 years of breeding.

The idea of cloning animals for human consumption is not without its critics. First, there are the welfare concerns, as most cloned animals do not make it to term before being born, and many of those that do are born deformed or prone to illness. The Humane Society of the United States has asked for a ban on milk and meat from clones for just this reason. Second, there is still the concern that healthy clones may have subtle defects that could make their food products unsafe to eat.

As the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A45025-2005Apr11.html"&gt;Washington Post reports&lt;/a&gt;, some critics are asking why it is necessary to clone cows that produce huge amounts of milk when surpluses, rather than shortages, are the main problem facing the U.S. dairy industry today.

The &lt;a href="w%3AIrish%20Stock%20Exchange"&gt;Irish Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt; (ISE) officially launched the new &lt;a href="w%3AIrish%20Enterprise%20Exchange"&gt;Irish Enterprise Exchange&lt;/a&gt; (IEX) this morning in &lt;a href="w%3ADublin"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. The exchange is aimed at smaller firms seeking to raise capital without the hindrances and additional costs associated with a full listing on the main exchange.

At the moment eight companies are listed on the exchange - all having been previously quoted on the Exploration Securities Market (ESM) and the Developing Companies Market (DCM). However it is hoped that many small Irish firms listed on the &lt;a href="w%3AAlternative%20Investment%20Market"&gt;Alternative Investment Market&lt;/a&gt; (AIM) in &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; will eventually pursue a dual listing with the IEX.

The rules for listing on the IEX are significantly looser than for a full listing - no trading record is required; no minimum number of shares must be in public hands; and in most cases prior shareholder approval is not needed for acquisitions or disposals. The main requirement for listing is that prospective firms must have a market capitalisation of more than €5 million.

The IEX has long been a major ambition for Irish Stock Exchange CEO Tom Healy and indeed the exchange as a whole.

&lt;a href="w%3AEritrea"&gt;Eritrea&lt;/a&gt; officially launched a new national vaccination program yesterday to protect children against deadly &lt;a href="w%3Apolio"&gt;polio&lt;/a&gt;.

Despite having no confirmed cases of polio since 1997, neighbouring countries such as &lt;a href="w%3AEthiopia"&gt;Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt; have had more recent cases. The program will take place in two rounds, the first of which runs from Monday till Wednesday this week and the second is planned for May 13-15..

&lt;a href="w%3AUNICEF"&gt;UNICEF&lt;/a&gt; says that &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; accounts for 75 percent of polio cases reported worldwide so far in 2005. But efforts are being made to eradicate the potentially fatal virus. A total of 23 countries are currently planning to immunise up to 100 million children across the continent.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Commerce%20Department"&gt;U.S. Commerce Department&lt;/a&gt; released new figures on Tuesday, showing an imbalance of US$61.04 billion as of February. The figure was up 4.3 percent from the US$58.5 billion deficit last January.

"While we imported the necessities, we didn't sell a lot to the rest of the world," Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors told ♡❤Bloomberg♡❤. "As for the Fed, this report would likely mean more measured rate hikes," he said.

"We are sucking in more products faster than we can sell abroad. It will reduce GDP growth a bit, but not a lot," David Berson, the chief economist for Fannie Mae told ♡❤Reuters♡❤.

The trade deficit has been aggravated by high oil prices and a surge of &lt;a href="w%3Atextile"&gt;textile&lt;/a&gt; imports after the lifting of quotas on January 1. Oil prices have been close to record levels recently, but light sweet crude fell $1.85 to US$51.86 on Tuesday, after the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Energy%20Agency"&gt;International Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt; issued a prediction that interest rates and fuel costs would slow down demand for oil.

The new trade figures temporarily forced the dollar down against the yen and the euro. But later in the trading day, the dollar recovered lost ground as traders waited for a statement about the &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Reserve"&gt;U.S. Federal Reserve&lt;/a&gt; meeting last March.

One week into campaigning in the United Kingdom general election, the leader of the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Democrats%20%28UK%29"&gt;Liberal Democratic&lt;/a&gt; party, &lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Kennedy"&gt;Charles Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;, has become a father. 

Kennedy's wife, Sarah, was taken to St Thomas' Hospital, London, yesterday, and Kennedy abandoned the election tour on the first day out to join her. Donald James Kennedy was born just after midnight. 

"Everything went tremendously smoothly," Kennedy explained to reporters. "This new Donald James Kennedy who becomes the latest addition to the clan is our pride and joy."

Following weeks of speculation in some media quarters, it has been announced that &lt;a href="w%3ABritney%20Spears"&gt;Britney Spears&lt;/a&gt;, 23, is pregnant. 
In a posting on &lt;a href="http%3A//www.britneyspears.com/"&gt;her Web site&lt;/a&gt;, Spears announced that she and husband, &lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Federline"&gt;Kevin Federline&lt;/a&gt;, 27, were expecting their first child together. Her publicist, Sonia Muckle, confirmed the singer's pregnancy Tuesday but gave no further information.

"The time has finally come to share our wonderful news that we are expecting our first child together. There are reports that I was in the hospital this weekend," read a statement allegedly written by Spears. 

Federline has two children with his ex-girlfriend, actress &lt;a href="w%3AShar%20Jackson"&gt;Shar Jackson&lt;/a&gt;. He met Spears last year when he was a backup dancer on her tour and his girlfriend was pregnant with their son.

Preliminary reports suggest the cabin door popped open during extreme turbulence, which also caused a minor injury to the PM's elbow. Two police officers on board held the door closed while the plane made an emergency landing at &lt;a href="w%3AParaparaumu"&gt;Paraparaumu&lt;/a&gt; Airport, near Wellington.

"I had two New Zealand police with me who acted very, very quickly to grab the door and the two police officers were strong enough to hold the door right through the landing," Ms. Clark said

The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (TAIC) will be investigating.

No result as yet.

Genetics researchers announced today that they will beginning a five-year plan to create a map of human migrations based on DNA mapping. The "Genographic Project" will be funded by the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.waittfoundation.org/"&gt;Waitt Family Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIBM%20Corporation"&gt;IBM Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Geographic%20Society"&gt;National Geographic Society&lt;/a&gt;, and plans to collect 100,000 samples of DNA from people all over the world in order to sequence how related to each other they are.

Details on data collection have not yet been specified, but there are implications that some of the data will come from field work among indigenous groups, and that other individuals may purchase kits to submit their own DNA in order to learn about their own genes.

The project has drawn immediate comparison with the failed &lt;a href="w%3AHuman%20Genome%20Diversity%20Project"&gt;Human Genome Diversity Project&lt;/a&gt; from the 1990s, which ended after controversy over the patenting of the DNA of indigenous peoples. The Genographic Project leaders say that they will make the information from their project public and will not patent genes. Whether or not researchers using the data will be subject to licensing guidelines, or whether they can patent their own discoveries using the data, remains to be answered.

In the last decade, the role of IBM tabulating machines in &lt;a href="w%3Athe%20Holocaust"&gt;the Holocaust&lt;/a&gt; has been explored and criticized by a number of historians, and National Geographic has often been a target of critical theorists who have seen it as often representing the "gaze" of imperialism and &lt;a href="w%3AOrientalism"&gt;Orientalism&lt;/a&gt;.

Previous genetic mapping projects which focused on specific ethnic groups have met with continuous controversy, with allusions often made to the projects of racial &lt;a href="w%3Aanthropometry"&gt;anthropometry&lt;/a&gt; of the early 20th century which served as the "scientific" backbone to &lt;a href="w%3Ascientific%20racism"&gt;scientific racism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aeugenics"&gt;eugenics&lt;/a&gt; legislation. Though the Genographic Project participants have tried to emphasize that their project will be to look at the "similarities" between different groups of people rather than the "differences," it seems likely to remain a controversial issue.

Romanian President &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ATraian%20Basescu"&gt;Traian Băsescu&lt;/a&gt; signed an order yesterday recalling Romania's ambassadors to three European Union countries - Austria, Lithuania and Greece, as well as Croatia. The Romanian embassy in Vilnius, Lithuania, is also accredited to represent Romania's interests in Latvia. 

All five of the recalled ambassadors were appointed by the previous administration, under President &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AIon%20Illiescu"&gt;Ion Illiescu&lt;/a&gt;. The recall is part of an ongoing process of replacing Romanian ambassadors abroad, with the present government planning to recall nearly all diplomats appointed by the previous administration. 

The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mihai Răzvan Ungureanu, said that the recall was not based on political criteria, or as a way of politically undermining the choices of the previous administration, but rather on the efficiency of the diplomats as well as their age, seeing as many of them are past retirement age.

The local government of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AArad%20%28county%29"&gt;Arad County&lt;/a&gt; in western &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARomania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; today launched a project calling for the creation of a new industrial area in the commune of Zimandul Nou. They have already allocated 0.3 km² for this project, with more land being expected to be allocated for the industrial precinct.

The president of Arad Couty Council, Iosif Matula, says that the labour force in the area is qualified in industrial occupations, especially in the fields of textiles, furniture, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aelectronics"&gt;electronics&lt;/a&gt; and tools industries. The site also already has all the necessary infrastructure, such as gas, access to sewage and a water purifying facility.

The industrial area will be located on the outskirts of the Zimandul Nou commune, which is a fairly small, rural town. The proposed Zimandul Nou industrial area is one of the latest development projects by the Arad County Council, which has, since a few years ago, embarked on a fairly wide-ranging project of attracting foreign investment and developing further industry in rural areas.

The county capital, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AArad"&gt;Arad&lt;/a&gt;, with a population of nearly 190,000, is one of Romania's largest industrial centres and is a major centre for foreign investment, but the county council would like to see more industry heading to the rural areas. The Zimandul Nou precinct will be the eighth industrial zone in a formerly-rural area in the county. The other seven areas have already attracted combined foreign investments of over 120 million euro.

<h1>Torvalds codes temporary replacement for Bitkeeper</h1>

In the wake of Bitmover CEO Larry McVoy's decision to end the free distribution of the Linux version of the source code management system Bitkeeper, Linux founder &lt;a href="w%3ALinus%20Torvalds"&gt;Linus Torvalds&lt;/a&gt; has written a program called "git" to access the Linux source code repositories, Torvalds wrote in a post to the Linux kernel mailing list. The program, resting at version 0.04 as of April 13, is, according to &lt;a href="http%3A//kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/torvalds/git-0.04.tar.gz"&gt;Torvalds's README&lt;/a&gt; file: ♡❤"a stupid (but extremely fast) directory content manager. It doesn't do a whole lot, but what it _does_ do is track directory contents efficiently."♡❤

&lt;a href="Bitmover%20ends%20free%20Bitkeeper%2C%20replacement%20sought%20for%20managing%20Linux%20kernel%20code"&gt;When Bitmover changed its licensing scheme&lt;/a&gt;, Torvalds wrote that he was looking into using &lt;a href="w%3AMonotone%20%28software%29"&gt;Monotone&lt;/a&gt;; he added that he did not want to use &lt;a href="w%3ASubversion"&gt;Subversion (SVN)&lt;/a&gt;. According to Kerneltrap.org, on April 7, Torvalds noted, "I detest the centralized &lt;a href="w%3ASCM"&gt;SCM&lt;/a&gt; model, but if push comes to shove, and we just _can't_ get a reasonable parallell merge thing going in the short timeframe (ie month or two), I'll use something like SVN on a trusted site with just a few committers . . ."

While Torvalds characterized Monotone as slow, he was hopeful that it could be sped up. He anticipated using the pre-Bitkeeper system of "people email patches to Linus" until the 2.6.12 kernel is released in the next month or so.

&lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; have settled long-time border disputes, and with freed up cross-border traffic look to creating what would be the largest trading bloc in the world, between the two most populous nations on the planet. During a recent visit by Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao to the Indian capital of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADelhi"&gt;Delhi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a border was finally agreed on paper.

"India and China can together reshape the world order," Indian Prime Minister &lt;a href="Manmohan%20Singh"&gt;Manmohan Singh&lt;/a&gt; said Monday.

"China has a large manufacturing base. I believe it is the world's factory. And India with its development in software and other areas, I feel, is the world's office. What I am suggesting is to bring together the factory and the office," Chinese Ambassador to India, Sun Yuxi, had said ahead of the visit.

The agreement is the first official document for the 3,500 km disputed border between the two countries, in more than 20 years. The dispute erupted into war in 1962, followed by a 14 years freeze in diplomatic relations.

China would give up claims on 90,000 square kilometers to the North-East of India, formally recognising as parts of India, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASikkim"&gt;Sikkim&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;mdash; a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHimalayas"&gt;Himalayan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; kingdom that merged with India in 1975 &amp;mdash; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATawang%20district"&gt;Tawang&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;mdash; an area in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AArunachal%20Pradesh"&gt;Arunachal Pradesh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; which China had repeatedly claimed.

India would be formally recognising Tibet as a part of China, giving up &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAksai%20Chin"&gt;Aksai Chin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , uninhabited land on the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATibet"&gt;Tibetan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; plateau that &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABeijing"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; seized from the Indian states of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJammu%20and%20Kashmir"&gt;Jammu and Kashmir&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 1962. India agreed also "not to allow Tibetans to engage in anti-China political activities on its soil", according to a report in ♡❤The Economic Times♡❤ of India. 

A new cross-border trade route would be allowed through &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANathula"&gt;Nathula&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , in Sikkim, and significant road work was to facilitate higher traffic, at least on the Chinese side.

Eleven guiding principles and political parameters for resolving the disagreement, were put forth in the document, including a commitment to enhance bilateral trade from the present &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 13.6 billion to US$30 billion by 2010 &amp;mdash; trade which only a decade ago was worth just US$1 billion.

"This matter tells us that as long as the two sides bear sincerity, and patience, the border between China and India will become a bridge linking the friendship of the two sides," Wen said of the document he signed with Singh.

"A growing and stable China is in the interest of India. Similarly, a growing and stable India is in the interest of China," the Chinese Premier said.

"It shows a lot of give and take on both sides," said National Security Adviser M.K. Narayanan, India's special representative for the border talks.

The treaty "respect[s the] status quo, and is tantamount to accepting the Line of Actual Control as the border between the two countries," said Swaran Singh, a China expert at the Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi.

"The next two years are very crucial to determine how much the two sides put the guiding principles into practice for the actual demarcation of the frontier," he cautioned.

Feasibility of a China-India Free Trade Agreement would be examined &amp;mdash; with China eager, but India tentative.

&lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARomania"&gt;Romania's&lt;/a&gt; national airline, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ATAROM"&gt;TAROM&lt;/a&gt;, has announced that, from May 15 this year, all of its flights from &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABucharest"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt;, the Romanian capital, to &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AArad"&gt;Arad&lt;/a&gt;, a city in the country's west, will be cancelled, due to lack of financial viability and an increase in competition. The reason for the cancellation is mainly due to the planned inauguration on May 16 of a Bucharest-Arad flight operated by the private airline &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ACarpatair"&gt;Carpatair&lt;/a&gt;, Romania's second-largest airline. 

Carpatair has grown very quicly in the past two years, adding several new destinations, both in Romania and abroad. Also, it has taken away many of TAROM's customers on international routes because it provides direct connections from Transylvanian cities such as Arad and Timişoara to German and Italian cities, saving customers the task of changing flights at Bucharest. Also, although Carpatair started out as a Transylvanian airline, it now also flies to destinations in Romania's east, and is expected to open up new routes via Bucharest, in a further attempt to compete with TAROM and win more market share.

In 2004, TAROM was Romania's largest airline, carrying approximately 940,000 passengers. Carpatair came in at second, carrying approximately 271,000 passengers.

Mugur Isărescu, the governor of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Bank%20of%20Romania"&gt;National Bank of Romania&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (BNR) predicted yesterday that Romania would adopt the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aeuro"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; sometime between 2012 and 2014, possibly joining the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AERM%20II"&gt;Exchange Rate Mechanism II&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as early as 2010.

In July 2004, Romania will revalue its currency, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARomanian%20leu"&gt;leu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , so that 10,000 old lei will equal 1 new leu, with 1 euro being equal to approximately 3.6 new lei. Dual pricing, in both the old leu and the new leu, has already been introduced from March 2005. The transition to the new leu is expected to stabilise the Romanian currency and prepare the country for euro adoption.

After Isărescu's declaration, many people commented that they were surprised by how late the target date for euro adoption had been set, being 7-9 years away. However, Isărescu responded by stating that the new Central European members of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which joined in 2004, have not yet joined the euro, and that countries such as the &lt;a href="Czech%20Republic"&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Poland"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Hungary"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt; are only expected to adopt the currency between 2008-2010, 4-6 years after accession. In Romania's case, the adoption will take place 5&amp;ndash;7 years after accession in 2007.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Parliament"&gt;European Parliament&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has today approved the signing of the Accession Treaties of &lt;a href="Romania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Bulgaria"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt;, effectively endorsing their accession to the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;. The parliament voted on the Romanian Accession Treaty with 497 positive votes, 93 negative votes and 71 abstentions. Bulgaria received a slightly more positive message, with 522 votes in favour of its Accession Treaty, 70 negative votes and 69 abstentions.

After this vote, which was legally-binding, the two countries will sign their Accession Treaties on April 25, when they will move from being candidate countries to accession countries - that is, from April 25, the two countries will send observers to the European Parliament and will receive larger amounts of pre-accession funding.

<h2>Positive effects</h2>

The approval of the Accession Treaty is a very positive signal for Romania and Bulgaria, confirming their progress towards EU accession until this stage. Both countries started negotiations with the EU in 2000, and completed them in 2004.

The approval of the Treaty is expected to encourage greater foreign investment to the two countries. Already, the fact that they were EU candidate countries has made them more competitive than their &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASoutheastern%20Europe"&gt;southeastern European&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; neighbours. For example, Romania received $5.5 billion of foreign investment in 2004, triple the amount received in 2003. Bulgaria also attracted $2.54 billion, the highest per-capita amount in the region. Stocks have also risen, with the Bucharest-based BET10 exchange rising 84% in the last 12 months, and Sofia's Sofix rising 69%.

Also, the countries will benefit from a greater role within the European Union. They will send observers to the European Parliament from April 25, which will be able to take place in debates, even though they will not have voting power. Also, the countries will receive more funding between 2005 and 2007.

<h2>A long way to go</h2>

This step was one of the largest hurdles that the two countries faced before accession in 2007. Once the Accession Treaty has been signed, the only way that accession can be postponed is through the implementation of a safeguard clause by the European Commission, which can take place if either of the two countries are unprepared for joining the EU in key areas or have major problems with the last phases of accession.

However, despite the positive effects of the Accession Treaty vote, Romania and Bulgaria still have a significant amount of work to do in order to be fully prepared to join the EU in 2007. The establishment of an independent judiciary is a major issue in both countries, as is corruption. Additionally, the European Parliament has notified Bulgaria that it must deal with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aorganised%20crime"&gt;organised crime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in a more dynamic manner. In the case of Romania, the EU has said that more progress must be made in bringing competition law up to EU standards, as well as protecting the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aenvironment"&gt;environment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and reducing state aid to loss-making industries such as the steel sector.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOlli%20Rehn"&gt;Olli Rehn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the European Commissioner for Enlargement, said that "These countries still have a lot to do. They have criteria to fulfill so the safeguard clause doesn't kick in." If the safeguard clause is implemented, accession will be postponed until 2008. However, in the case of Bulgaria, the safeguard clause can only be implemented if all 25 member states vote unanimously on it. In the case of Romania, only a majority vote is needed.

In either case, analysts are predicting that both countries would have to face very major problems in key areas for the safeguard clause to go into effect.

A survey by the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.pewinternet.org/"&gt;Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project&lt;/a&gt; found that 28% of users with a personal email account say they receive more spam than they used to, while 22% say the amount has decreased.

53% of the users surveyed said that spam has made them trust e-mail less; this is down from 62% last year. 22% (down from 29% last year) report that they use e-mail less because of spam.

Spam however is becoming more accepted. 77% of users last year reported &lt;a href="w%3AE-mail%20spam"&gt;spam&lt;/a&gt; has made being online unpleasant, this year the number falls to 67%. Users also reported that pornographic spam is down.

In contrast, “&lt;a href="w%3Aphishing"&gt;phishing&lt;/a&gt;” (email fraudulently requesting personal financial information) is up. 35% of users say they have received a phishing attempt, and 2% have provided the requested information to phishers. 

The Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project is a non-profit research centre that produces reports that study the social effects of the Internet.

&lt;a href="%3Aw%3AAl-Jazeera"&gt;Al-Jazeera&lt;/a&gt; TV has released video of an American, 47 year old &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AJeffery%20Ake"&gt;Jeffrey Ake&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ALaPorte%2C%20Indiana"&gt;LaPorte, Indiana&lt;/a&gt;, in the custody of three machine-gun wielding masked men.

A &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AUS%20Embassy"&gt;US Embassy&lt;/a&gt; official said the video did not have an audio track, but Al-Jazeera reports the man is asking that American troops be removed from Iraq so that he may live.

Ake is posed behind a wooden desk holding what appears to be his passport and a photo ID. His family had no comments on the situation, nor did those at Ake’s business. He is the president and founder of Equipment Express of Rolling Prairie, Indiana, a industrial assembly plant for water bottling equipment.

White House press secretary Scott McClellan said that no negotiations with the kidnappers will take place.

Ake is one of at least 200 foreigners who been kidnapped or have gone missing in the past year in Iraq. At least 30 have been killed.

&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Cricket"&gt;New Zealand Cricket&lt;/a&gt; is coming under increasing domestic pressure to reject a touring trip to . The &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Cricket%20Council"&gt;International Cricket Council&lt;/a&gt; (ICC), however, has demanded of the New Zealand Cricket team, called the 'Black Caps', to keep the scheduled play in Zimbabwe where there is to be five-week tour later this year.

&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Prime%20Minister"&gt;New Zealand Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Helen%20Clark"&gt;Helen Clark&lt;/a&gt; has condemned the tour stating, "Zimbabwe has just had a rigged election, which has produced a result which is simply unbelievable. I ... wouldn't go near it." But she refused to ban the tour, placing the onus instead on New Zealand Cricket.

The ICC may fine New Zealand up to US$2 million dollars for not attending the tour. England cricket, though, just bought its way out of playing two test matches at a cost of $400,000.

In 1981 there were nationwide protests during the &lt;a href="w%3A1981%20Springbok%20Tour"&gt;South African Springbok rugby tour&lt;/a&gt;. Several games were cancelled due to the protests.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALondon%2C%20UK"&gt;London, UK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — &lt;a href="w%3ABritain"&gt;Britain's&lt;/a&gt; Secretary of State for Health, &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Reid"&gt;John Reid&lt;/a&gt;, is amongst those calling for the withdrawal of &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party"&gt;Conservative&lt;/a&gt; candidate for &lt;a href="w%3ADorset"&gt;Dorset&lt;/a&gt; South, Ed Matts, after he doctored photos in campaign literature. 

The photo in question originally showed Matts and the Conservative front-bencher &lt;a href="w%3AAnne%20Widdecombe"&gt;Anne Widdecombe&lt;/a&gt; campaigning on behalf of an immigrant family living in &lt;a href="w%3AWeymouth"&gt;Weymouth&lt;/a&gt;, in the Dorset South constituency, in March last year.

When the photo appeared in Matts' campaign literature, the people in the background were removed from the photo and a slogan calling for the family to be allowed to stay was replaced by one calling for immigration control.

The seat, taken by &lt;a href="w%3ALabour%20Party"&gt;Labour's&lt;/a&gt; Jim Knight in the 2001 general election, is one of the most fiercely contested in the country, being Labour's smallest majority.

Conservative leader &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Howard"&gt;Michael Howard&lt;/a&gt; condemned Matts' behaviour but refused to sack him. Conservative shadow Chancellor &lt;a href="w%3AOliver%20Letwin"&gt;Oliver Letwin&lt;/a&gt;, from neighbouring Dorset West, said that the message on the doctored photo was consistent with conservative policy.

In the aftermath of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AColumbia%20space%20shuttle"&gt;Columbia space shuttle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; accident, which cost the lives of seven &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aastronaut"&gt;astronauts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the current chief of &lt;a href="NASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASean%20O%27Keefe"&gt;Sean O'Keefe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; had decided further maintenance to the space telescope of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHubble%20Space%20Telescope"&gt;Hubble&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was too dangerous, and that maintenance of the telescope would be dropped, essentially decommissioning the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Asatellite"&gt;satellite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . This caused some concern in the scientific community. A mission to repair the satellite using robots was dismissed as too complicated.

However, in light of space flight being resumed as of May 19th, the decision should be reconsidered, according to the nominee for the next chief of NASA, Griffin.

"We should revisit the earlier decision in light of what we learn after return to flight," Griffin told the Senate Commerce committee Tuesday. He noted when NASA resumes space flight, it will be with the completely-overhauled Shuttle - effectively a new vehicle - which will require new risk-analyses.

The Hubble telescope has some major discoveries on its record, providing the first visual proof for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ablack%20hole"&gt;black holes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Abig%20bang%20theory"&gt;big bang theory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and establishing for the first time the age of the universe. Hubble's solar cells should provide it with enough power in its current state to maintain orbit until 2007. It was hoped that with servicing, the telescope could be maintained until 2011. Its replacement the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Webb%20telescope"&gt;James Webb telescope&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which will be equipped with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ainfra-red"&gt;infra-red&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , will not be launched until 2010.

&lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; today launched the &lt;a href="w%3ALabour%20Party"&gt;Labour Party's&lt;/a&gt; 112 page manifesto for a third term, entitled "Britain: Forward not back", at London's &lt;a href="w%3AMermaid%20Theatre"&gt;Mermaid Theatre&lt;/a&gt; this afternoon, promising not to increase income tax or VAT.

Blair, with Chancellor &lt;a href="w%3AGordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt;, described the manifesto, which focused on economic policy, as "radical", "quintessentially New Labour" and giving people the "chance to succeed and make the most of what they have".

As well as economic promises, the manifesto pledged better social housing, increased funding and reform of education and the National Health Service and the introduction of community police patrols. The manifesto does not promise a freeze on National Insurance, the income-linked tax which funds the &lt;a href="w%3ANHS"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; and pensions.

Conservative leader &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Howard"&gt;Michael Howard&lt;/a&gt; said that the British people had "heard it all before", and reiterated claims that Labour would have to increase taxes significantly in the third term.

Deputy leader of the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Democrats"&gt;Liberal Democrats&lt;/a&gt;, Sir &lt;a href="w%3AMenzies%20Campbell"&gt;Menzies Campbell&lt;/a&gt;, whose party was the only mainstream party consistently against the Iraq war, said Labour would "not be judged by their promises, but by what they have done", adding that Labour have not kept their previous promises.

The &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party"&gt;Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Party"&gt;Green Party&lt;/a&gt; launched their manifestos yesterday, and the Liberal Democrats launch theirs tomorrow.

&lt;a href="San%20Jose%2C%20California"&gt;San Jose&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; police are investigating a new lead in the Wendy's "Chili Finger" case. The ♡❤San Jose Mercury News♡❤ is reporting a spotted leopard tore off part of a finger from an owner of exotic animals, Sandy Allman, in &lt;a href="w%3APahrump"&gt;Pahrump, Nevada&lt;/a&gt;. The portion of Allman's torn off finger was approximately the same size - 1 1/2-inches long - as the one which resident Anna Ayala found in a cup of chili, at a San Jose outlet on Monterey Highway on March 22.

Pahrump is approximately 45 miles away from Las Vegas.

"What are the odds?" Carol Asvestas told the ♡❤San Jose Mercury News♡❤. Asvestas says she witnessed the leopard tear off the finger and owns an exotic animal sanctuary. She reported the incident to a hotline run by Wendy's, which is offering US$50,000 for information leading to the origin of the finger.

"Somebody might be able to say it looks the same but scientifically to say it's the same, you'd have to do DNA testing," Captain Bob Dixon, of the Santa Clara County Sheriff-Coroner's Office, told the ♡❤San Jose Mercury News♡❤.

Cindy Carroccio told the ♡❤San Jose Mercury News♡❤ that the finger was not reattached, and that the clinic "gave it back to her (Allman) in a little bag of ice."

<h3>Ayala drops lawsuit</h3>
On the same day the Pahrump exotic animal lead was announced, Anna Ayala decided to drop her lawsuit against Wendy's.

The lawsuit "has caused her great emotional distress and continues to be difficult emotionally," Jeffrey Janoff, Ayala's attorney told the ♡❤Associated Press♡❤. Janoff declined to provide more of an explanation for why he was no longer involved with the case. He denied that there was any connection to the new lead from Pahrump.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — The British Electoral Reform Society, Electoral Commission and the Association of Chief Police Officers have discouraged the British people from using the postal voting system, and asked campaigners in the general election not to take part in applying for or returning postal votes.

The call comes one week after a Labour Councillor in Birmingham was jailed for election fraud, after party campaigners collected blank ballot papers from confused voters in a trial of a postal-only election.

On Sunday the judge in the trial of Muhammed Hussain, Richard Mawrey QC, described the postal voting system as hopelessly flawed, and said the government was in denial about the problems.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A%5B%5BUnited%20Kingdom%5D%5D"&gt;[[United Kingdom]]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — The &lt;a href="Conservative%20Party%20launches%20manifesto"&gt;Conservative Party manifesto&lt;/a&gt;, launched earlier today, has been criticised by opponents as being unrealistic.

The pledge of £35 billion of savings from "government slimlining", and subsequent tax cuts, has been attacked by Labour and the Liberal Democrats. The Conservatives plan to continue funding front-line services at the current rate by relying on economic growth to make up the difference. 

Labour described the plans as "a complete economic mess", the current Chancellor, Gordon Brown claiming there would be a shortfall of "£18.9bn in year one, £18.5bn in year two and £14.4bn in year three." Labour leader Tony Blair claimed that the Labour and the Conservatives economic roles had reversed since the 1980s, when many had lost faith in Labour's ability to handle the economy.

The deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, Sir Menzies Campbell, claimed that £5.5 to 8 billion of cuts were unrealistic.

&lt;a href="Blair%20launches%20third%20and%20final%20manifesto"&gt;Labour's manifesto is launched tomorrow&lt;/a&gt;, and the Liberal Democrats launch theirs on Thursday. Conservative shadow Chancellor Oliver Letwin has already criticised Gordon Brown's budget of March this year, claiming it will create an £11bn shortfall.

Thirteen students demanding a living wage and increased benefits for workers of &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20University"&gt;Washington University&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Louis"&gt;St. Louis&lt;/a&gt;, have entered the ninth day of a sit-in at the school's administrative offices. Also, adding to pressure mounting on university officials, 15 additional students began a hunger strike last night.

The protesting students seek a living wage of at least $9.79 and more benefits for the University's contract workers.

Yesterday, the administration agreed to commit $500,000 toward a benefit and wage package, but student organizers insist that the university will need to spend about $2.4 million annually to raise employee wages above the poverty line. Currently non-union workers make $8 per hour.

Last month a hunger strike at &lt;a href="w%3AGeorgetown%20University"&gt;Georgetown University&lt;/a&gt; led to a compromise between a student coalition and the administration increasing wages and benefits.

&lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; has announced a low-cost &lt;a href="w%3AWindows%20XP%20Starter%20Edition"&gt;Windows XP Starter Edition&lt;/a&gt; is to be launched in &lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;.

Windows XP Starter Edition has been previously released in several other countries in &lt;a href="w%3AAsia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;. These editions are sold only as a low-cost OEM bundle. The edition is quite similar to Windows XP Home but with some restrictions: only three applications may be run concurrently, 800×600 is the maximum display resolution and home networking is disabled.

Brazil has been increasingly adopting open source software for IT projects, rather than using Microsoft products. The country recently launched the PC Conectado initiative, which aims to greatly increase the use of computers in homes, schools and businesses by making them as much as 50% cheaper. An important cost-saving measure is the exclusive use of open source software. No Microsoft software is being used.

Trades unions are to ballot members on strike action following the announcement of 4,000 job cuts at the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Broadcasting%20Corporation"&gt;British Broadcasting Corporation&lt;/a&gt; (BBC).

Formal notice of the strike ballot was sent to the public service broadcaster today by &lt;a href="w%3ABroadcasting%2C%20Entertainment%2C%20Cinematograph%20and%20Theatre%20Union"&gt;BECTU&lt;/a&gt;, the technicians' union, the manual workers' union &lt;a href="w%3AAmicus"&gt;Amicus&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Union%20of%20Journalists"&gt;National Union of Journalists&lt;/a&gt; (NUJ), after the Director General, &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Thompson"&gt;Mark Thompson&lt;/a&gt; failed to rule out compulsory redundancies.

The job cuts announced last month, amounting to approximately 20% of the BBC's staff, are part of £355 million of savings that the BBC are making before the review of the broadcaster's royal charter by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, which fund the BBC through the license fee. Further production jobs are being moved into the private sector.

Luke Crawly of BECTU said that it was unrealistic to expect 100% programme quality from 80% of staff. Ballot papers will be sent in seven days, with the aim of shutting down live broadcasting of sports events including the &lt;a href="w%3AWimbledon%20Championships"&gt;Wimbledon Tennis tournament&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AFA%20Cup"&gt;Football Association Cup&lt;/a&gt; final.

The BBC's rival &lt;a href="w%3AITV"&gt;ITV&lt;/a&gt; is experiencing strike action over wages at production companies &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Weekend%20Television"&gt;London Weekend Television&lt;/a&gt; (LWT), &lt;a href="w%3AYorkshire%20TV"&gt;Yorkshire TV&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGranada"&gt;Granada&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3A3sixtymedia"&gt;3sixtymedia&lt;/a&gt;, that has led to prerecording of shows and has forced ITV to borrow studios at the BBC's Television Centre.

The &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt; of the United Kingdom, Monday, launched its slimline manifesto for the &lt;a href="UK%20general%20election%2C%202005"&gt;May 5th general election&lt;/a&gt;, a twenty-seven page document entitled ♡❤The British Dream♡❤.

The manifesto focuses on five key areas:

♡❤♡Lower tax and value for money♡❤♡: The party plans to make up to £12 billion of savings annually by reducing beurocracy such as &lt;a href="w%3Aquangos"&gt;quangos&lt;/a&gt;. £8 billion will reduce previous deficit, and £4 billion of tax cuts will be made, especially to what have been called "stealth taxes". The party promised that funding for education, health, transport and international development would not be cut, and spending on police, defence and pensions would be increased.

♡❤♡Flexible childcare and school discipline♡❤♡: The manifesto promised an increase in maternity pay and more choice of childcare. Under a conservative government more independence over expulsions and admissions would be given to school heads and governors. Special schools for disruptive pupils would be created, and more vocational courses would be created for 14-16 year olds.

♡❤♡Better healthcare and cleaner hospitals♡❤♡: A major feature of the coservative campaign has been hospital sourced infections, and in respose the party have promised to introduce ward matrons charged with keeping hospitals clean, with the authority to close wards with &lt;a href="w%3AMRSA"&gt;MRSA&lt;/a&gt; infections. A Conservative government would contribute funding towards operations in private hospitals. Econimic migrants with HIV or TB would not be allowed to live or work in Britain.

♡❤♡Safer communities and more police♡❤♡: A Conservative government would increase police recruitment by 5,000 a year. The manifesto promised to increase prison terms and increase Britain's prison capacity by 20,000 places. The party would reverse the Labour government's decision to relax laws prohibiting Canabis use.

♡❤♡Secure borders and controlled immigration♡❤♡: The manifesto proposes a new border police at Britain's busiest air and sea ports, with 24 hour surveilance. The party would set a quota on economic migrants and reject asylym-seekers who are not vetted by the &lt;a href="w%3AUNHCR"&gt;UNHCR&lt;/a&gt;.

Party leader &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Howard"&gt;Michael Howard&lt;/a&gt; summed up the manifesto: "If you long for cleaner hospitals, more police, school discipline, controlled immigration, lower taxes and accountability - you can vote for it, on 5 May", accusing prime-minister Tony Blair, who is campaigning for his third term, of letting the country down.

<h2>Response</h2>
The manifesto has been criticised by the Labour &lt;a href="w%3AChancellor%20of%20the%20Exchequer"&gt;Chancellor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt;, for being unrealistic in its extimates of savings, and in predictions of economic growth resulting from tax cuts, calculating that there would be approximately £18 billion annual deficits.

Labour's election strategist, &lt;a href="w%3AAlan%20Millburn"&gt;Alan Millburn&lt;/a&gt;, said that the manifesto shows that the Conservatives still stand for privilege and not opertunity, and described it as the shortest suicide note in political history.

The Deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, Sir &lt;a href="w%3AMenzies%20Campbell"&gt;Menzies Campbell&lt;/a&gt;, claimed that claimed that £5.5 to 8 billion of cuts were unrealistic. &lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Kennedy"&gt;Charles Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; said that voters had already decided the Conservative Party could not run public services.

The &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organisation"&gt;World Health Organisation&lt;/a&gt; (WHO), in a statement issued Tuesday, urged scientists to destroy samples of a deadly flu virus that could potentially cause a global pandemic.

Shipments of the influenza virus sent to Mexico and Lebanon are unaccounted for. The U.N. health organization said 10 countries receiving samples already destroyed them, while 5 more countries are in the process of doing so.

The virus, A/H2N2, was detected by a Canadian lab which contacted the Public Health Agency of Canada, who in turn warned the WHO and other national health agencies on March 26.

Meridian Bioscience sent routine testing kits infected with the virus to almost 5,000 laboratories, of which 3747 in 18 countries have so far been identified as having the virus, most of them in North America.

The virus is a variant of the H2N2 virus which caused the 1957 Asian Flu Pandemic, but which was displaced by the H3N2 variant. People born after 1959 are unlikely to be immune to the virus.

With little ceremony, one of the most innovative and radical new media projects in decades, the Creative Archive was officially launched today by the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Broadcasting%20Corporation"&gt;British Broadcasting Corporation&lt;/a&gt; (BBC).

In partnership with the &lt;a href="w%3AOpen%20University"&gt;Open University&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AChannel%204"&gt;Channel 4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Film%20Institute"&gt;British Film Institute&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACreative%20Commons"&gt;Creative Commons&lt;/a&gt;, the Creative Archive will allow UK residents access to selected items from the archives of British public service radio and television broadcasting.

The Archive has been in pre-development stages for several years, and today's official launch saw the creation of the Creative Archive website and the Creative Archive License, a special copyright license developed with &lt;a href="w%3AOxford%20University"&gt;Oxford University&lt;/a&gt; and the Creative Commons project. Under the license British citizens will be able to download and modify clips from the archive without having to pay royalties.

Over the summer, the BBC will be releasing archives of documentaries, particularly from its acclaimed Natural History collection, under the Creative Archive License, while Channel 4 has commissioned a special selection of programmes which will not be broadcast, but will be available on the internet. The BFI will be releasing silent movies from the early 20th century on the Creative Archive.

Other organisations expressing an interest in the Creative Archive include &lt;a href="w%3ATeachers%27%20TV"&gt;Teachers' TV&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3ANatural%20History%20Museum"&gt;Natural History Museum&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AIndependent%20Television%20News"&gt;Independent Television News&lt;/a&gt;.

Yes, he carved up and ate another human being, but it was not without the victim’s express consent—so goes the defense of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AArmin%20Meiwes"&gt;Armin Meiwes&lt;/a&gt;, known as the ‘German cannibal,’ following appeals by both sides, defense and prosecution, of the verdict.

While Meiwes was convicted to 8 ½ years in prison for the manslaughter killing and eating of another human, Bernd Juergen Brandes, he argues that the victim had volunteered to be eaten, advertising the fact that he wanted someone to take part in “slaughter and consumption” on the Internet.

Testimony in the case showed that Brandes wanted to die a stabbing death after imbibing a bottle of cold medicine to lose consciousness.

Brandes “came to me of his free will to end his life,” said Meiwes. He believes his actions are a mercy killing, not manslaughter.

The &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AFederal%20Constitutional%20Court%20of%20Germany"&gt;Federal Constitutional Court of Germany&lt;/a&gt;, the highest court in the country, is reviewing the January 2004 conviction. The trial gained notoriety both from graphic descriptions Meiwes gave during the proceedings, as well as a grisly video presented to the judges in closed session.

Meiwes seeks a reduction in sentence to 5 years, while the prosecution believes the cutting and dismembering deserves not just the full 8 ½ years already passed against the defendant, but a life sentence.

The court should decide by Friday, April 22, 2005.

Results of the second phase in an ongoing major study of the spiritual lives of college students was released Wednesday, April 13 by a research center at UCLA. The study is a groundbreaking attempt to gain insight into the spiritual lives and concerns of students and improve how faculties and administrators at US colleges and universities address this part of their students' lives.

The study, named &lt;a href="http%3A//spirituality.ucla.edu/"&gt;The Spiritual Life of College Students&lt;/a&gt;, was conducted by the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.gseis.ucla.edu/heri/heri.html"&gt;Higher Education Research Institute&lt;/a&gt; (HERI), a research center of higher education in the United States. HERI is based in the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.gseis.ucla.edu/"&gt;Graduate School of Education &amp; Information Studies&lt;/a&gt; (GSE&amp;IS) at &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20California%2C%20Los%20Angeles"&gt;University of California, Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; (UCLA). 

HERI also produces a widely-cited annual &lt;a href="http%3A//www.gseis.ucla.edu/heri/freshman.html"&gt;Survey of Entering Freshman&lt;/a&gt; through its &lt;a href="http%3A//www.gseis.ucla.edu/heri/aboutcirp.html"&gt;Cooperative Institutional Research Program&lt;/a&gt; (CIRP) program.

<h2>Study methodology</h2>

Co-Principal Investigators of the Project were Alexander Astin, Founding Director of HERI and widely-cited author of 20 books on higher education; and Helen Astin, psychologist, professor at UCLA, and author of 11 books and many articles on women, leadership and spirituality. The study was funded by a grant from the &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Templeton%20Foundation"&gt;John Templeton Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.

The study has so far been undertaken in two major phases. First a pilot survey was taken in Spring 2003 by 3,680 undergraduates at 46 US colleges and universities.

Results from that survey were used to revise the questions, then the survey was given again in Fall 2004 to 112,232 students, the freshman classes of 236 US colleges and universities in the United States. The study included both quantitative (multiple choice) and qualitative focus group interview approaches. &lt;a href="http%3A//spirituality.ucla.edu/about/survey.html"&gt;Copies of the questionnaires&lt;/a&gt; which were administered are available from the center's website.

HERI also conducted a secondary survey of faculty to assess their spiritual beliefs in conjunction with this study.

A follow-up survey of students is planned for Spring 2007 when they are expected to be juniors.

<h2>Goals of the research</h2>

Goals of the in-depth, multi-year project &lt;a href="http%3A//spirituality.ucla.edu/about/index.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are to:
<ul>
BULLET::::- Examine the patterns of spiritual growth experienced by students in their college years.
BULLET::::- Involve colleges and universities in assisting students by providing opportunities for their spiritual growth.
BULLET::::- Popularize the study results to college and university decision-makers and the &lt;a href="w%3AMass%20media"&gt;mainstream media&lt;/a&gt;.

</ul>
For purposes of the study, the spiritual aspect under discussion was taken to refer to varying concepts such as traditional beliefs, mystical experiences, and a personal sense of meaning and values, in other words, "our interiors, our subjective life, as contrasted to the objective domain of material events and objects." &lt;a href="http%3A//spirituality.ucla.edu/faq.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

<h2>Resulting data</h2>

The differences and similarities in students' beliefs, activities and affiliations were examined along a number of dimensions, to assess the impact of the students beliefs on their daily lives. The results are summarized below. Note that the terms describing the various categories are taken verbatim from the survey results. Note also that some of the percentages add to more than 100% because the answers were not mutually exclusive and more than one answer could be checked.

<h3>Affiliations</h3>

The survey offered 20 choices of religious affiliation of various kinds, which may be broadly classified as Christian sects, Buddhist, Islamic, Jewish, Other, and None. The most numerous categories of response were:

<ul>
BULLET::::- 28% Roman Catholic
BULLET::::- 17% Mainline Protestants such as Episcopalian, Presbyterian, Methodist, and Lutheran
BULLET::::- 17% No religious preference
BULLET::::- 13% Baptist
BULLET::::- 11% Other Christian

</ul>
The fact that the survey was administered only at US schools agrees with the expression of predominantly Christian opinion.

<h3>Beliefs</h3>

Here is a quick summary of some of the major beliefs and interests of the students, that may be seen to indicate their overall level of involvement with such issues:

<ul>
BULLET::::- 79% believe in God
BULLET::::- 76% are searching for meaning/purpose in life
BULLET::::- 80% are interested in spirituality

</ul>
<h3>Lifestyles</h3>

Some of the findings in this area include:

<ul>
BULLET::::- 81% attend religious services
BULLET::::- 80% discuss religion or spirituality with friends
BULLET::::- 69% pray

</ul>
Although this percentage seems high, the proportion of US adults who pray is even greater at 82%, according to the Barna Group. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.barna.org/FlexPage.aspx%3FPage%3DTopic%26amp%3BTopicID%3D19"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; This fact is "not surprising" according to the author of the article in the Christian Science Monitor, given that college students are widely perceived as being hedonistic and less than serious.

<h3>Politics</h3>

Student's religious beliefs and affiliations were correlated with their political orientation in some predictable and some unexpected ways.

<ul>
BULLET::::- "Among students who show high levels of Religious Engagement, conservatives outnumber liberals by better than 3 to 1"
BULLET::::- "However, liberals substantially outnumber conservatives among those with high scores on Ethic of Caring (2 to 1) and Ecumenical worldview (3 to 1)"

</ul>
Unexpectedly however, very religious students were found to be more likely to oppose the death penalty and affirmative action, but to hold generally similar views to less-religious or spiritually inclined students on issues of race and sex.

The study also noted "sharp differences" in areas such as legalized abortion, casual sex, same-sex marriage, and the legalization of marijuana based on the students' level of religiousness or spirituality.

<h3>Religious tolerance</h3>

The findings on religious tolerance seem consistent overall with the practice of reconciling contradictions of religious faith in a modern, pluralistic society.

<ul>
BULLET::::- 83% say “non-religious people can be just as moral as religious believers”
BULLET::::- 64% say that “most people can grow spiritually without being religious”

</ul>
<h3>Confidence Levels</h3>

The student's personal level of confidence in their own belief was also studied:

<ul>
BULLET::::- 42% secure
BULLET::::- 23% seeking
BULLET::::- 15% conflicted
BULLET::::- 10% doubting
BULLET::::- 15% not interested

</ul>
<h3>Expectations</h3>

The survey also attempted to address how students feel about the role their schools should play in assisting their personal spiritual quest.

<ul>
BULLET::::- 67% said that it was important to them that their college "Helps you develop your personal values"
BULLET::::- 48% said that it is “essential” or “very important” that their college "Encourages personal expression of spirituality"

</ul>
The results seem to indicate a substantial demand for greater support of student's religious and spiritual pursuits by the colleges and universities they attend. This in turn suggests that future programs to address these kinds of needs may be developed at some colleges in response to the awareness raised by this study.

Authorities in the &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; today questioned the integrity of tests conducted by &lt;a href="w%3AGreenpeace"&gt;Greenpeace&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20environmental%20organizations"&gt;environmental awareness organisation&lt;/a&gt;, purporting to show that &lt;a href="w%3AGenetic%20engineering"&gt;genetically engineered (GE)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ARice"&gt;rice&lt;/a&gt; has been illegally farmed and sold, in the largest rice-producing country.

Greenpeace alleges through a press release that "it appears GE Rice is being sold, planted, consumed, and possibly exported", with the Chinese government not having approved the crop. Local farmers in &lt;a href="w%3AHubei"&gt;Hubei&lt;/a&gt; Province where the GE crops were allegedly found, had tipped the organisation off.

Greenpeace says it tested rice bought there during February and April, and 19 of the 25 samples taken returned positive results for &lt;a href="w%3AGenetically%20modified%20organism"&gt;transgenic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADNA"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt;, with two containing an alteration that means the rice incorporates genes from a bacteria, &lt;a href="w%3ABacillus%20thuringiensis"&gt;Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)&lt;/a&gt;, used to produce a toxin that kills pests. ♡❤(see &lt;a href="http%3A//www.greenpeace.org/international/press/reports/RiceatRiskTestResults"&gt;tests results summary&lt;/a&gt;)♡❤

"We've asked the agricultural department in Hubei Province to conduct on-the-spot examination on this issue," an unidentified official with the Office of Genetically Modified Organism Safety under the ministry of Agriculture was reported as saying, by &lt;a href="w%3AChina%20Daily"&gt;♡❤China Daily♡❤&lt;/a&gt;.

"We have not seen the concrete testing reports. Moreover, the testing of GM (Genetically Modified) rice seeds should be based on China's technical standards," he said.

Programme director for Greenpeace in Beijing, Liu Haiying, told by the newspaper that samples collected in Hubei Province were sent to a gene testing laboratory in &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;.

Zhu Xinquan, chairman of the Chinese Society of Agro-Biotechnology, said to ♡❤China Daily♡❤: "I cannot agree with the findings of the report by Greenpeace and I am wondering if the tests conducted by the organization are scientific or not."

"Regulations on GM food have been in force for several years in China and the nation is doing more research before approving the commercialization of GM rice. A cautious attitude must be taken on the safety of GM rice since it is a highly important food for Chinese people," said Zhu to ♡❤China Daily♡❤.

Scientists at Huazhong Agriculture University in &lt;a href="w%3AWuhan"&gt;Wuhan&lt;/a&gt;, capital of Hubei, have been conducting tests with the engineered strain of rice. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.economist.com/science/displayStory.cfm%3Fstory_id%3D1491569"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The area is geographically close to an area diverse in rice strains, where Greenpeace says that natural &lt;a href="w%3AEvolution"&gt;evolution&lt;/a&gt; of rice is threatened by the potential of escaped GM rice genes. This is centered in the nearby provinces of &lt;a href="w%3AGuizhou"&gt;Guizhou&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGuangxi"&gt;Guangxi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AYunnan"&gt;Yunnan&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.greenpeace.org/international/news/scandal-greenpeace-exposes-il"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Greenpeace says, "No country in the world has commercially released GE rice."

Hassan Hashash, a &lt;a href="w%3APalestinians"&gt;Palestinian&lt;/a&gt; aged 15, was detained by the Israeli military on Tuesday, April 12, at the Hawara checkpoint south of &lt;a href="w%3ANablus"&gt;Nablus&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Bank"&gt;West Bank&lt;/a&gt;. Hashash had been hiding five explosive charges under a winter coat before attempting to ignite one in the presence of Israeli soldiers, the military said. In the sweltering 26&amp;deg;C (78&amp;deg;F) heat, the teenager's incongruous attire caught the attention of an &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael%20Defense%20Forces"&gt;IDF&lt;/a&gt; paratrooper nicknamed Muli.

"The boy pulled out a matchbox, held up a &lt;a href="w%3Apipe%20bomb"&gt;pipe bomb&lt;/a&gt;, and attempted to detonate it," said Muli. "We aimed our weapons at him and told him to move away from us" (Ynet).

The military reported that after taking the youth to an isolated area they searched him and found another four explosives.

"You could see it's a young child who was sent [by someone]," said Muli. "I looked into his eyes: he was on the brink of tears and scared to death."

The Hawara checkpoint has seen this kind of trouble before. In April 2004, soldiers there arrested a 16-year-old, also Palestinian, with a &lt;a href="w%3Asuicide%20bombing"&gt;suicide bomb&lt;/a&gt; strapped to his body. The teenager, Hussam Abdo, later told an Israeli newspaper he was on a mission to kill Israeli soldiers. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/03/25/world/main608756.shtml"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Israeli radio noted that this is the third Palestinian child in the past two months caught attempting to transfer explosives past Israeli checkpoints.

An exhausted &lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Kennedy"&gt;Charles Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; returned to the election campaign to launch a twenty page &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Democrats%20%28UK%29"&gt;Liberal Democrat&lt;/a&gt; manifesto targeted at disaffected Labour voters, promising a fairer tax system and withdrawal from Iraq.

Entitled ♡❤The Real Alternative♡❤ the manifesto pledges to reduce the lowest rate of income tax, but increase the rate on those earning over £100,000 to 50%. The party would also scrap the unpopular local council tax in favour of a new local income tax. The manifesto also promises to remove hidden "stealth taxes".

Under this system the party claims the poorest 15 million (25%) of people in Britain would be better off, and the middle 50% would be paying no extra tax.

The manifesto promised to scrap the controversial university tuition fees, increase services for pensioners and add £100 a month to the state pension, and train 21,000 new primary school teachers and 10,000 new police. A Lib Dem government would make eye and dental checks free, and reduce the cost of prescription medicine.

The Liberal Democrats were the only one of the three largest parliamentary parties to have consistently voted against the Iraq war, and the manifesto has promised an exit strategy with a phased withdrawal of Britain's 8,000 troops still in the country.

"We reject a foreign policy based on 'my ally right or wrong'," Kennedy said. "And we say that war should always be a last resort."

Kennedy, who became a father on Tuesday, admitted he'd had little sleep before the manifesto launch, and stumbled while answering questions on the proposed tax system.

<h2>Response</h2>
Deputy leader of the &lt;a href="w%3ALabour%20Party"&gt;Labour Party&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Prescott"&gt;John Prescott&lt;/a&gt;, focused on the 50% of the population falling in the higher tax bands, claiming that under a Lib Dem government a household with a combined income of £41,000 would be paying an extra £1,170 tax a year.

&lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt; chairman, Dr &lt;a href="w%3ALiam%20Fox"&gt;Liam Fox&lt;/a&gt; said that the Liberal Democrats were not the real alternative on crime and the "immigration system being chaos".

Kennedy rejected this claim: "Over the course of the last parliament the Liberal Democrats have been the real opposition - over issues like Iraq, student top-up fees, the council tax and compulsory ID cards - while the Conservatives have either lined up with Labour or flip-flopped."

A Guardian/ICM opinion poll yesterday found that while the Conservative's policy on immigration was popular with traditional Conservative voters, it was unpopular with undecided voters, and was failing to win voters over from other parties.

The &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AWorld%20Health%20Organization"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WHO) issued a warning to 3,747 laboratories in the United States and 17 other countries around the world, instructing them to destroy samples of the deadly H2N2 Asian &lt;a href="w%3Ainfluenza"&gt;influenza&lt;/a&gt; virus that was mistakenly sent to them last fall by the College of American Pathologists, US company Meridian Bioscience and several other organizations responsible for testing laboratory proficiency worldwide, as soon as possible.

The H2N2 flu strain killed between 1 million and 4 million people in 1957 and is thought to have become extinct in the wild in 1968. The WHO stated that the virus strain should never have been circulated, because of the risk that it could cause a pandemic among people born after 1968, who would probably have little or no immunity to it, as the strain is not contained in current flu vaccines.

The &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ACenters%20for%20Disease%20Control%20and%20Prevention"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; is operating under the presumption that the H2N2 strain was purposefully dispatched. Officials of both organizations have assigned a low but real risk to the possibility of an outbreak. No-one has actually become infected.

According to WHO, the virus was sent to laboratories in &lt;a href="w%3ABelgium"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABermuda"&gt;Bermuda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AChile"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHong%20Kong"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASaudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASingapore"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3ARecording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America"&gt;Recording Industry Association of America&lt;/a&gt; (RIAA) has filed 405 lawsuits against students at 18 &lt;a href="w%3Acollege"&gt;college&lt;/a&gt;s across the &lt;a href="w%3AUS"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;. The RIAA says these students were illegally sharing songs and films over the &lt;a href="w%3AInternet2"&gt;Internet2&lt;/a&gt;. They claim that 3,900 songs were available on the network. The RIAA said that each person sued downloaded an average of 2,300 songs.

The MPAA has also filed several lawsuits, against students, but has declined to comment on the number of students sued. The MPAA claim that users of the Internet2 had swapped 99 terabytes of films per day. This is more then 15,000 full length films.

The Internet2 is a high speed network used by 207 US universities. It was designed to provide a high speed alternative for researchers and other educators to share information. The Internet2 allows for very high speed connections &amp;mdash; a film can be downloaded in as little as 30 seconds, compared with approximately six hours over other high-speed connections, such as DSL.

Cary Sherman the president of the Recording Industry Association of America is quoted as saying that "Internet2 is increasingly becoming the network of choice for students looking to steal songs and other copyrighted works on a massive scale”.

Some have raised the issue of how the RIAA and MPAA gained access to the network, as it is a closed network environment for universities only. The Internet2 does not know how they gained access as they have not given them access or handed over any data. The RIAA will not say how it did the monitoring, but claims it was entirely legal.

A spokesperson for the Internet2 told the Los Angeles Times that copyright infringement is prohibited under its rules, though its chief executive, Doug Van Houweling, in a separate interview admitted that he is aware that there is a lot of file-sharing going on. He also stated that it is possible to filter traffic so as to block illegal activity; however, it would slow the network's performance and they will not be doing it.

Legislators in &lt;a href="w%3ASpotsylvania%20County%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Spotsylvania County, Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, are proposing a new law that would make pet owners criminally responsible for their animal’s actions.

This follows the death of a boy after a dog attack. The proposal would make it a category IV &lt;a href="w%3AMisdemeanor"&gt;misdemeanor&lt;/a&gt; if a conviction for negligence is gained against a pet owner charged for their dog biting someone, punishable by a $250 fine. For a second offense, the penalty can go up to $1000 or 6 months in jail, and for a third offense, $2500, or a year in jail. The &lt;a href="w%3ALegislation"&gt;legislation&lt;/a&gt;, if enacted, would enable the creation of a criminal profile for a negligent animal owner and the animal itself.

On a ♡❤CBS6♡❤ news report broadcast recently on an &lt;a href="w%3AOrange%20County%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Orange County&lt;/a&gt; boy killed by the family dog, they said the station received many angry e-mails from dog owners about the story when it was aired earlier that day. It is a topic that draws strong views from both sides of the argument, and probably explains why the &lt;a href="w%3AVirginia"&gt;Commonwealth of Virginia&lt;/a&gt; has been strangely quiet on the subject. It appears the state government is willing at this point to let it be slugged out at the county level, while remaining distant and learning from it above the fray. This means that if a Spotsylvania County dog owner cannot abide a new law that might fine him $250 because his dog bit the mailman, he can move to a nearby county where no such law exists.

The legal wording the county might use in drafting the legislation should not concern itself with the species of pet. All pets should be affected because the legislation should be indiscriminate. What it needs to concern itself with is what meets the definition of a pet, and exactly what negligence is.

Recall that Dianna Large, now charged with a felony, originally said she owned only 1 of the 3 &lt;a href="w%3APit%20bull"&gt;pit bulls&lt;/a&gt; involved in the attack that killed an elderly woman. Even if she later recanted that, if her defense can show that her status as pet owner of the other 2 dogs is only slight, or if it exists at all under current law, that would have a big impact on the case.

There will be a public hearing on May 10 to discuss proposals that may change county legislation.

Two Houston residents were arrested at their homes today as a Federal indictment was unsealed in U.S. District Court in &lt;a href="w%3AManhattan"&gt;Manhattan&lt;/a&gt;.

David Chalmers Jr, a Houston oilman, and a &lt;a href="w%3ABulgaria"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt;n citizen, Ludmil Dionissiev, a permanent U.S. resident, were taken into custody. A third man, John Irving, was also indicted. He is a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; citizen whom prosecutors hope to extradite to the U.S.

U.S. Attorney David N. Kelley announced that most charges focus on Chalmers. At a New York news conference, authorities accused the men of plotting to pay secret kickbacks so Chalmers’ oil companies could sell oil under cover of the Iraqi &lt;a href="w%3AOil-for-Food%20Programme"&gt;oil-for-food program&lt;/a&gt;.

The funds were intended for humanitarian relief, not oil revenues.

The three men face a maximum of 62 years in prison and fines totaling $1 million (US) if convicted. Additionally, the court could force them to make restitution. 

The indictment says the government seeks forfeiture of at least $100 million (US) in assets from the three.

The same news story said an indictment on another case was unsealed in that court today. Tongsun Park, a South Korean, was charged with conspiracy to act as an unregistered government agent for Iraq in the United States to create the oil-for-food program.

Lawyers for the defendants were not immediately available.

The oil-for-food program began in December 1996 as a humanitarian effort to support the people of Iraq, and ended after the US-led invasion in 2003. Many scandals and kickbacks are documented and criminal prosecutions for bribery, sanctions busting, money laundering and fraud are expected to lead to dozens of arrests in many countries. Reporters were told that it is likely that the enforcement actions will occur in mid-summer, 2005.

&lt;a href="China"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; Foreign Ministry spokesman &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AQin%20Gang"&gt;Qin Gang&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; told reporters that China is protesting &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;'s plan to allow drilling for gas and oil in disputed waters in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEast%20China%20Sea"&gt;East China Sea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , characterizing the move as "a serious provocation".

On Wednesday, Japan announced that they would begin processing applications to allow oil and gas drilling firms to explore in the disputed area, east of the "demarcation line" which has held up applications to drill in the area for decades.

"The Chinese and Japanese positions differ on that matter, but we need to continue talks from a big point of view, without inflaming conflicts, and to turn the sea of conflict into a sea of coordination," Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi told a news conference.

Qin Gang said that China reserved "the right to take further reaction," according to ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AXinhua"&gt;Xinhua&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤.

"China has never ever recognized and will never recognize the demarcation line," Qin told reporters.

Japan's exploration of the disputed zone could start early next month, and will be defended by Japanese military vessels, according to the ♡❤Sydney Morning Herald♡❤.

<h2>Protesters plan second weekend of demonstrations</h2>
Japan's latest move further inflamed Sino-Japanese tensions. Chinese activist Feng Jinhua plans to meet with his group to plan a second weekend of protests in China over Japan's actions.

"Expression of anti-Japanese sentiment and boycott of Japanese products is to be expected from Chinese citizens," Jinhua told the ♡❤Sydney Morning Herald♡❤.

Thousands of anti-Japan protesters marched in &lt;a href="Beijing%2C%20China"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Guangzhou"&gt;Guangzhou&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Shenzhen"&gt;Shenzhen&lt;/a&gt; last weekend.

Wheeler, keeper and head of entomology at the Natural History Museum in London, intended the names to be an honor: "We admire these leaders as fellow citizens who have the courage of their convictions and are willing to do the very difficult and unpopular work of living up to principles of freedom and democracy rather than accepting the expedient or popular."

Miller is a post-doctoral fellow at Brigham Young University.

A. bushi Miller and Wheeler inhabits southern Ohio, North Carolina and Virginia. A. cheneyi Miller and Wheeler lives in Chiapas, Mexico. A. rumsfeldi Miller and Wheeler is from Oaxaca and Hidalgo in Mexico.

Other inspirations for names include their illustrator Frances Fawcett, their wives, geographic areas, Latin and Greek words, the Aztecs, Pocahontas, and Darth Vader.

A &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APark%20City%2C%20Utah"&gt;Park City&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Utah"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt; nutritional supplement manufacturer won its appeal against the &lt;a href="FDA"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday as a Federal Judge lifted a ban and sent the case back to the agency for revised rulemaking in accordance with the court's decision. 

Judge &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATena%20Campbell"&gt;Tena Campbell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ruled that no further enforcement of the FDA action can take place until the FDA reviews its current regulation.

Neutraceutical claimed in its lawsuit that the product "has been safely consumed" for hundreds of years and is not harmful at low ephedrine product levels. The FDA had decided to ban the supplement based on a reverse logic that the product had to be proven safe. The lawsuit effectively argued that it is the FDA's task to prove that all dosage levels of ephedrine were unsafe. The court agreed with the manufacturer that this assumption could not be proven and, when taken in low doses, less than 10 mg, that agree with the product labeling, ephedrine was not shown to be an "unreasonable or significant risk."

A group of private researchers claimed that ephedra was the most dangerous herbal product on the market. They collected data from poison control centers. It was not considered to be a drug and could not be controlled the way pharmaceuticals were, and was sold over the counter.

The death in 2003 of 23-year old &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABaltimore%20Orioles"&gt;Baltimore Orioles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; pitcher &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Bechler"&gt;Steve Bechler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; brought a slew of negative reports on the product that foreshadowed a sharp drop in sales.

<h1>Romanian economy predicted to maintain steady growth until 2008</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Romanian%20economy%20predicted%20to%20maintain%20steady%20growth%20until%202008&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The National Forecast Committee of Romania today released its economic predictions for the country in the period 2005-2008. The report predicted that the Romanian economy should increase steadily over the next three years, with a rise in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Agross%20domestic%20product"&gt;gross domestic product&lt;/a&gt; (GDP) of about 6.2% per annum until 2008. By the end of 2008, this should lead to Romania's gross domestic product being nearly 30% larger than it was at the end of 2004. For 2005, the prediction is that the economy will grow by 6%, after last year's impressive growth of 8.3%. The reason for the slowing of growth is due to government reforms from 2005-2008, as well as counter-inflationary policy, which are expected to stabilise consumption and therefore slow growth. Despite this, even a growth rate of 6% is one of the highest in the region, and well above the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; average.

Concerning the structure of GDP between 2005 and 2008, the largest increases are expected to be recorded in the services and industry sectors. While total agricultural output is also expected to rise, it will contribute a smaller share of GDP in comparison to 2004, when a good harvest enhanced total GDP growth by nearly 3%.

The other important macro-economic indicator that the report said Romania must focus on is &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Ainflation"&gt;inflation&lt;/a&gt;, which is expected to lower to 7% this year, after a rate of 9.2% in 2004. The National Bank of Romania and the Romanian government have pledged to lower inflation until the country's EU accession in 2007. While &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aunemployment"&gt;unemployment&lt;/a&gt; dropped to 6.2% in 2004, one of the lowest rates in Europe, it is expected to rise in 2005 to around 7%, due to structural reforms of the economy, as well as a drop of state subsidies to key industrial sectors. However, by 2008, the forecasted unemployment rate is 6.1%.

Whereas GDP growth, inflation and unemployment are all expected to improve favourably until 2008, the weaker point in the economy is the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Acurrent%20account%20deficit"&gt;current account deficit&lt;/a&gt;, which should continue to increase until 2008, according to the National Forecast Committee. In 2006, the current account deficit is expected to be 6.2% of GDP, while in 2008 it will be around 5%. While these rates are an improvement of the 2004 figure of nearly 7%, they still remain fairly high. On the other hand, direct foreign investment is expected to rise significantly until 2008, covering a portion of the current account deficit. Foreign invesment in 2005, should reach 4.1 billion euros this year, and will probably increase significantly from 2007 onwards, as Romania becomes a member of the European Union.

&lt;a href="%3Aw%3AFrance%20Telecom"&gt;France Telecom&lt;/a&gt; announced yesterday that it would increase its indirect participation in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AOrange%20Romania"&gt;Orange Romania&lt;/a&gt; to 96.63%. This is because it acquired over 23% of the mobile phone operator from a group of investors led by the AIG New Europe Fund. The investors include the Polish Enterprise Fund LP and Polish Enterprise Fund IV LP, Innova/98 LP, Communications Venture Partners, BancBoston Capital, Societe Generale Romania Fund and Alcatel NV. Before the share increase, Orange Romania was owned 51% by France Telecom's subsidiary Orange, 22.6% by Wirefree Services Belgium and the rest by several smaller investors.

&lt;a href="%3Aw%3AOrange%20Romania"&gt;Orange Romania&lt;/a&gt; is currently Romania's largest mobile phone operator, with 48% market share and over 5 million subscribers. Between 2003 and 2004, it registered an increase in turnover of 47%, with total turnover in 2004 being 624 million &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aeuro"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Marshals%20Service"&gt;Marshals Service&lt;/a&gt; working together with nearly 960 other law enforcement agencies recently concluded a week-long operation, Operation FALCON, which succeeded in the arrest of 10,340 fugitives across the United States and elsewhere. Other regional sweeps have been conducted before; but this was the first of its kind at the national level and resulted in the highest number of arrests ever recorded in a single operation.

&lt;a href="w%3AOperation%20Falcon%20%28Federal%20Dragnet%29"&gt;Operation FALCON&lt;/a&gt;, which stands for "Federal And Local Cops Organized Nationally", received the cooperation of more than 3,000 law enforcement agents from the US Marshals, state, county and city level, and other US agencies. Operations were also coordinated internationally with &lt;a href="INTERPOL"&gt;INTERPOL&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20State"&gt;US State Department&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in the detainment of 16 foreign and international fugitives.

Operation FALCON was conducted during a one week period, April 4-10, 2005, chosen to coincide with &lt;a href="http%3A//www.ojp.usdoj.gov/ovc/ncvrw/welcome.html"&gt;National Crime Victim's Rights Week&lt;/a&gt;, April 10-16, the dates being chosen to "honor the victims" of violent crime in America. “By taking violent fugitives off the streets and putting them behind bars where they belong,” said Attorney General &lt;a href="Alberto%20Gonzales"&gt;Alberto Gonzales&lt;/a&gt;, “we've honored the victims and made our streets safer.”

The focus of Operation FALCON was on apprehending fugitives wanted for violent crimes, gang activities, drug trafficking, and sex-related offenses. Arrests were made in all 50 states, the &lt;a href="District%20of%20Columbia"&gt;District of Columbia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Guam"&gt;Guam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Puerto%20Rico"&gt;Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt;, and in several International locales.

“I applaud the achievements of every Deputy Marshal, police officer, detective, trooper, investigator, deputy sheriff, and special agent who hit the street virtually around-the-clock for seven days,” said Robert J. Finan II, the Marshals Service’s Assistant Director for Investigative Services. He continued, “Also of note is that during the course of this initiative, there were no serious incidents or serious injuries to either law enforcement officers or those who were taken into custody.”

The organization formerly known as the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Association%20of%20Retired%20Persons"&gt;American Association of Retired Persons&lt;/a&gt; released a report claiming that prescription drug prices in the United States rose 7.1% in 2004. Overall U.S. inflation was about 3 percent in 2004.

The study covers 197 of "the brand name prescription drugs most widely used by Americans age 50 and older." The drug prices are compared on a month-by-month basis, i.e. January of 2004 is compared to January of 2003. Percentages were then averaged to arrive at quarterly and annual figures. According to the report, most of the change occurred in the first quarter of 2004; the average brand-name drug price in the first quarter of 2004 was 3.5% higher than the average price in the same quarter in 2003.

The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a trade group, faults the AARP's report. For example, the trade group says medical inflation, which is greater than overall inflation in the United States, would have made a more appropriate comparison.

Three drugs increased by more than 20% in price in 2004, said the study: &lt;a href="w%3APremarin"&gt;Premarin&lt;/a&gt;, Miacalcin, and &lt;a href="w%3ANeurontin"&gt;Neurontin&lt;/a&gt;. The companies that led the way with price increases were Boehringer Ingelheim, Aventis, and Purdue Pharmaceuticals, each with average price increases of greater than 10%. Three companies increased their prices by less than 6%: Merck, GlaxoSmithKline, and Eisai, according to the study.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Movie%20industry%20looks%20toward%20BitTorrent%20as%20possible%20video%20distribution%20method&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

According to Dr. &lt;a href="w%3AVint%20Cerf"&gt;Vinton Cerf&lt;/a&gt;, a few movie producers have talked about using filesharing such as &lt;a href="w%3ABitTorrent"&gt;BitTorrent&lt;/a&gt; for the distribution of video content. Dr. Cerf is considered to be one of the fathers of the Internet. One of the problems with having a &lt;a href="w%3Avideo%20on%20demand"&gt;video on demand&lt;/a&gt; service is video files take quite a bit of bandwidth to distribute. Through the use of file sharing, the clients that are requesting a video can share information amongst themselves and can take some of the load off of the original distributor. The only draw back to using file sharing is the distribution would not be instant; instead, it would have to be pre-recorded like &lt;a href="w%3ATiVo"&gt;TiVo&lt;/a&gt;.

Ironically, the movie industry has been suing people for &lt;a href="w%3Afile%20sharing"&gt;file sharing&lt;/a&gt; for years now. In the end, this same technology might save the movie industry millions. Cerf said, "They are only just now starting to come to honest grips with the possibilities of using the Internet," according to ♡❤ZDNet Australia♡❤.

Currently, waves of lawsuits against internet file-sharing services continue to be mounted. 11 countries across Europe and Asia have seen lawsuits filed against individuals by record companies fighting file-sharing technology which they say is costing it billions. The total number of lawsuits worldwide is in the range of 12,000.

<h1>Lebanese Prime Minister steps down</h1>
♡❤♡April 15, 2005♡❤♡
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ALebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AOmar%20Karami"&gt;Omar Karami&lt;/a&gt;, stepped down yet again Thursday, April 14 after failing to reach a consensus in negotiations on candidates to fill key cabinet positions necessary for scheduled elections to take place in May.

Karami said he could no longer work with President Emile Lahoud. Both were pro-Syria, the country that has maintained a military presence in Lebanon for 29 years.

Syria is now withdrawing its forces from the country. A general election for a new government is planned to be held in May, although a functioning government is required to oversee the polls. Temporary Interior Minister Suleiman Franjieh warned that delaying the elections could lead to unrest and called for the polls to still be held next month.

Opposition leaders have accused the government attempting to delay the polls, and have warned of street protests if the situation is not quickly resolved.

Due to greater consumer demand, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABritish%20Airways"&gt;British Airways&lt;/a&gt; announced yesterday that it would run a further three flights weekly on the route from &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABucharest"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="%3Aw%3AHenri%20Coanda%20International%20Airport"&gt;Henri Coandă International&lt;/a&gt;) to &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="%3Aw%3AGatwick%20Airport"&gt;Gatwick&lt;/a&gt;). The Bucharest-London flights will run on Monday, Thursday and Saturday, while the return flights will run on Wednesday, Friday and Sunday. The extra flights will mean that British Airways will now fly from Bucharest to London, and back, ten times a week.

Grey Deacon, a spokesman of the &lt;a href="w%3AMinuteman%20Project"&gt;Minuteman Project&lt;/a&gt;, told the "Worldnet RadioActive" show in an exclusive interview on April 14 that representatives from the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union"&gt;American Civil Liberties Union&lt;/a&gt; are now criminally involved in helping illegal entrants cross the US border and avoid detection. He alleges that the ACLU activists are making noise and flashing lights to alert potential illegals to move on to a non-patrolled area of the border.

"The ACLU's position is that illegal aliens have a right to enter our border and stay in this country as long as they want," said Deacon. "That's what one of the leaders of the group told me personally."

These allegations exist despite the ACLU's officially stated position of not directly interfering with the Minutemen's activities. The ACLU's press release of March 30 affirmed that the participation of ACLU members would be strictly limited to being "neutral observers" and "recorders", not "participants", according to ACLU of Arizona Board President Stan Furman, a former Arizona State Senator.

"We recognize the right of a country to defend its borders," said Eleanor Eisenberg, Executive Director of the ACLU of Arizona, "but it must be done by the proper authorities and in a humane way," suggesting that the primary concern on the ACLU in interacting with the Minuteman Project was to prevent violence.

The ACLU also quotes prior allegations against the group that sponsors the Minutemen, writing that they are "alleged to have engaged in activities that go beyond First Amendment-protected activity and that is intended to intimidate, harass or otherwise interfere with the rights of others."

<h2>Bryan Barton T-shirt incident</h2>

The only widely known incident to result from Minuteman activities so far this month was the alleged temporary detention of a suspected illegal immigrant by Bryan Barton on April 6. Encountering a suspected illegal immigrant and believing him to be dehydrated from exposure, Barton gave the man cereal and milk, according to the Minuteman Project press release.

Later Barton shook his hand and asked him to pose for a picture with a T-shirt that read, "Bryan Barton caught an illegal alien and all I got was this lousy T-shirt". Barton then allegedly gave the man US$20 before a Border Patrol agent arrived to take the man into custody.

Although Barton was investigated by the Cochise County Sheriff's department and determined not to have broken the law, he was dismissed from further activities with the Minutemen because of violating the group's procedures, which specify no physical contact with suspected illegal immigrants.

"The volunteer's actions were admirable, justified and undeniably humane, but unfortunately they jeopardized our established procedures and overall purpose of passively monitoring the border," said Chris Simcox, co-founder of the Minuteman Project. "It's unfortunate, but we had to dismiss him from further participation."

Police in Melbourne have seized over a tonne of ecstacy in a shipment of tiles from Italy. Four were arrested on Thursday and early Friday relating to the shipment, which the Australian Federal Police has called the biggest shipment of street-ready &lt;a href="w%3AEcstasy%20%28drug%29"&gt;ecstacy&lt;/a&gt; pills in the world.

The four men were charged with aiding and abetting a prohibited import, according to ABC radio. Five million tablets were seized, with a reported street value of US$190 million (AU$250m). Two were additionally charged with attempting to possess a prohibited import. 

Federal police were continuing to investigate a crime ring behind the shipment, a spokesperson told ♡❤News24.com♡❤.

Federal Agent Mike Phelan said: "The AFP is now working with its counterparts in Italy and other parts of Europe to identify any overseas links with this latest seizure."

X-rays taken of the shipment, which arrived in Port Melbourne earlier in the week, had revealed anomalies inside eight pallets which were stacked with tiles, said a report from ♡❤Australian Associated Press♡❤.

Police then monitored the shipping container until it was delivered on Thursday to a suburban Melbourne factory, where two men were arrested, according to the ♡❤News24.com♡❤ report. Agents searched a dozen homes and businesses across Melbourne and arrested two more men early on Friday. All four suspects were due to appear in court later on Friday. 

Federal Justice Minister &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Ellison"&gt;Chris Ellison&lt;/a&gt; praised the AFP, the Australian Customs Service and the Australian Crime Commission involved in the operation, which he told ♡❤Australian Associated Press♡❤ had been ongoing since January.

"This big seizure sends a very clear message to those who want to traffic drugs to Australia, you will be caught and face very serious penalties," Senator Ellison told the news agency, saying the shipment "could have wreaked havoc".

"Anyone who says this sort of seizure does not slow the supply of drugs is quite obviously out of touch with reality."

The previous largest Australian ecstasy haul occurred in November 2004 in Sydney, when 1,800 pounds of ecstasy tablets and powder were seized, Australian Federal Police (AFP) told ♡❤Reuters♡❤, compared to this shipment's weight of 2,240 pounds.

The last &lt;a href="w%3ABritain"&gt;British-owned&lt;/a&gt; volume car manufacturer, &lt;a href="w%3AMG%20Rover"&gt;MG Rover&lt;/a&gt;, has closed down, with the loss of 5,000 jobs.

International accounting firm &lt;a href="w%3APriceWaterhouseCooper"&gt;PriceWaterhouseCooper&lt;/a&gt; was brought in last week to put the company into administration. Today PwC announced that MG Rover's only hope, the &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; car company &lt;a href="w%3ASAIC"&gt;SAIC&lt;/a&gt;, had no interest in buying the ailing firm. With no further source of revenue, PwC has closed the company's factory in &lt;a href="w%3ALongbridge"&gt;Longbridge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABirmingham"&gt;Birmingham&lt;/a&gt; and has laid off 5,000 workers.

Some 1,000 workers will continue for a while to complete the remaining cars left on the production line.

The &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; reported PwC joint administrator Tony Lomas as saying "We'll explore what we would describe as the break-up of the business, we will carry on with the interested parties who want to talk about pieces of the business.". PwC said around 70 offers for various parts of the company had been made but no serious offers of money made.

Recent efforts to save the company had been centered on convincing SAIC (Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp.) to buy the company as a going concern, but the Chinese company stated it would only buy the company if it's financial position could be guaranteed to be secure for at least two years. The British government could not make such a commitment due to &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; trade and competition rules.

The SAIC company did buy the designs for the 75 and 25 models and for the K-Series engines for £67m.

The Rover car company has a long but troubled history. It was formed in 1968 after a series of mergers of existing car manufacturers, and was nationalized in 1975 after it ran into financial difficulties. In 1979 a long-running deal to collaborate on developing new vehicles was established with the &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt; company &lt;a href="w%3AHonda"&gt;Honda&lt;/a&gt;. In 1988 the company was privatized and was bought by &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Aerospace"&gt;British Aerospace&lt;/a&gt;. In 1994 British Aerospace sold the business to &lt;a href="w%3ABMW"&gt;BMW&lt;/a&gt;, who then sold the &lt;a href="w%3ALand%20Rover"&gt;Land Rover&lt;/a&gt; brand to &lt;a href="w%3AFord"&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt; and finally sold the company in 2000 for just £10, retaining the well-known &lt;a href="w%3AMini"&gt;Mini&lt;/a&gt; brand for themselves. The MG Rover company was run by a private group until its collapse.

MG Rover has not launched a new model since the 75 was introduced in 1998 during the period of ownership by BMW. Their next newest model was the 25, originally launched as the 200 series some ten years ago. Rover also produced the 45, which dates from 1990, and the ZF sports car first launched in 1995. Sales of Rover cars accounted for just 3% of the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; car market in 2004.

Tony Blair announced a £150 million support package for the recently unemployed workers of the MG Rover plants, though it has been claimed that his generous offer may be more as a result of the nearby marginal seats in the upcoming elections than compassion on his part.

The 11th crew of the &lt;a href="International%20Space%20Station"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt; rocketed into space Thursday at 8:46 EDT. The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AExpedition%2011"&gt;Expedition 11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; crew rode aboard a &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASoyuz"&gt;Soyuz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; spacecraft, and two of them will remain in their new home-away-from-home for six months.

They were given a heartfelt send-off by Russian Mission Control chief Vladimir Solovyov:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The people who are doing the job are real romantics who are involved in fascinating work for a miserable salary," he told reporters after the launch, which he called a "remarkable event."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cosmonauts typically earn $144 to $179 a month.

The launch from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABaikonur%20Cosmodrome"&gt;Baikonur Cosmodrome&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;a href="Kazakhstan"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt;, came as ISS was on a north east heading approximately 230 miles above the southern &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAtlantic%20Ocean"&gt;Atlantic Ocean&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

At the controls were Commander Sergei Krikalev, &lt;a href="NASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; Station Science Officer and Flight Engineer John Phillips, and European Space Agency astronaut Roberto Vittori. Vittori will return April 24 with the prior crew, Expedition 10 Commander Leroy Chiao and Flight Engineer Salizhan Sharipov, after conducting some experiments.

Soyuz will dock with ISS at 10:19 p.m. EDT on Saturday. Live NASA coverage of the docking and hatch opening will be shown on NASA TV beginning at 9 p.m. Saturday and can be viewed on Internet TV at &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/ntv&lt;/nowiki&gt; (Free Real Player or Windows Media Player required).

&lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASalt%20Lake%20City"&gt;Salt Lake City&lt;/a&gt; (Utah) resident and hospital orderly Mark Hacking pleaded guilty Friday to killing his wife Lori, and placing her body in a dumpster.

Mrs. Hacking’s disappearance last summer touched off an intense, weeklong search in Salt Lake County which a wire service report said was similar to the other sensational Salt Lake crime, the kidnapping of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AElizabeth%20Smart"&gt;Elizabeth Smart&lt;/a&gt; from her own bedroom.

After Hacking admitted details of his crime to his family, earlier, he suffered a breakdown and was placed in a psychiatric hospital. He was seen in court Friday with his hands cuffed behind his back.

He admitted to the judge that he killed his wife while she slept. His motives, according to prosecutors, were his anger and despondency when she discovered that he was not accepted into a North Carolina medical school as he had claimed, but would remain a hospital orderly.

Mrs. Hacking is reported to have broken down sobbing at her workplace, a Wells Fargo brokerage, after discovering her husband’s deception. She had placed a call to the medical school’s administrators and been told he was not enrolled. He had lied to her about graduating from the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AUniversity%20of%20Utah"&gt;University of Utah&lt;/a&gt; as well.

Mrs. Hacking’s mother and father were in the courtroom to hear their son-in-law declare: “I intentionally shot Lori Hacking in the head with a .22 rifle.” They said it was like a “knife in the heart” to hear that, but were happy he owned up to the crime.

The attack occurred last July. Volunteers scouring a landfill found her decomposed remains after three months of searching.

<h1>Senate unanimously confirms Michael Griffin as new NASA head</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Senate%20unanimously%20confirms%20Michael%20Griffin%20as%20new%20NASA%20head&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The U.S. &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; unanimously confirmed on Wednsday the nomination of &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Griffin"&gt;Dr. Michael Griffin&lt;/a&gt; to head the &lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;National Aeronautics and Space Administration&lt;/a&gt; (NASA), making him the 11th administrator of the US-based space agency. He takes office at a time when NASA is busy with preparations for the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.nasa.gov/returntoflight/main/"&gt;return to flight&lt;/a&gt; of the space shuttle Discovery, expected sometime during the launch window of May 15 through June 3, 2005.

The presidential nominee Griffin was the head of the Applied Physics Laboratory's &lt;a href="http%3A//www.jhuapl.edu/aboutapl/organization/SD.html"&gt;Space Department&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3AJohns%20Hopkins%20University"&gt;Johns Hopkins University&lt;/a&gt;, a position he held almost a year. Prior to that, he was a chief engineer at NASA before coming over from service as Deputy for Technology at the &lt;a href="w%3AStrategic%20Defense%20Initiative"&gt;Strategic Defense Initiative&lt;/a&gt; Organization. He has made a career of the aerospace field.

Griffin was critical at times of U.S. priorities in space exploration by questioning its continued commitment to the International Space Station. Griffin, in testimony before the House Science Committee in 2004, outlined more ambitious plans for human exploration and settlement of the solar system in which he believes the United States should play a key role. 

In a statement during his April 12, 2005, confirmation hearing before the Senate Commerce Committee, Griffin said, "In the twenty-first century and beyond, for America to continue to be preeminent among nations, it is necessary for us also to be the preeminent spacefaring nation," with a spirit of discovery similar to the exploration of the New World by Columbus with the support of the Spanish crown.

Griffin, 55, notably holds seven academic degrees from various institutions, including a bachelor's degree in physics; master's degrees in aerospace science, electrical engineering, applied physics, civil engineering and business administration; and a PhD in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Maryland.

<h2>NASA's upcoming priorities</h2>

The list of NASA's upcoming priorities, as outlined by Griffin during his confirmation hearing, offer insight into the direction that America's space program may take under his leadership. 

In his prepared statement, Griffin said, "my priorities in executing the duties of [NASA Administrator], consistent with the
President’s Vision for Space Exploration, will be:&lt;br&gt;
- Flying the Shuttle as safely as possible until its retirement, not later than 2010.&lt;br&gt;
- Bringing a new Crew Exploration Vehicle into service as soon as possible after Shuttle retirement.&lt;br&gt;
- Developing a balanced overall program of science, exploration, and aeronautics at NASA, consistent with the redirection of the human spaceflight program to focus on exploration.&lt;br&gt;
- Completing the International Space Station in a manner consistent with our International partner
commitments and the needs of human exploration.&lt;br&gt;
- Encouraging the pursuit of appropriate partnerships with the emerging commercial space sector.&lt;br&gt;
- Establishing a lunar return program having the maximum possible utility for later missions to Mars and other destinations."

President Bush's &lt;a href="w%3AVision%20for%20Space%20Exploration"&gt;Vision for Space Exploration&lt;/a&gt;, referred to by Griffin above, is currently United States policy on various aspects of space exploration, announced on January 14, 2004 after the &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Columbia"&gt;Space Shuttle Columbia&lt;/a&gt; Disaster of February 1, 2003. The US is committed to a future of both human and robotic exploration of the solar system, with an emphasis on maintaining safety and advancing scientific and technical knowledge.

According to the ♡❤Cambridge Chronicle♡❤, a report issued by the city of &lt;a href="w%3ACambridge%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Cambridge&lt;/a&gt; on the topic of &lt;a href="w%3Agreenhouse%20gas"&gt;greenhouse gas emissions&lt;/a&gt; claimed that despite a two-year old pledge to reduce harmful emissions, the amount of &lt;a href="w%3Acarbon%20dioxide"&gt;carbon dioxide&lt;/a&gt; released into the atmosphere in the city has increased. Since 1990, carbon dioxide emissions have increased by 27% in the city, mostly due to industrial processes, says the paper.

In 1999, the city joined Cities for Climate Protection, a coalition of towns in &lt;a href="Massachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; interested in reducing their greenhouse gas emissions. In 2002, the city released a study, the Cambridge Climate Protection Plan, which set emission reduction goals for the city. The plan proposed that "we reduce GHG emissions by 20 percent below 1990 levels. This means the community needs to reduce and prevent annual GHG emissions of 494,400 tons of carbon dioxide."

While the city has failed thus far to reduce its emissions, it has been experimenting with alternative transportation technology in its vehicles. According to the city's website, Cambridge currently owns and operates 20 &lt;a href="w%3Aelectric%20vehicle"&gt;electric vehicle&lt;/a&gt;s and 1 compressed natural gas truck. Additionally, most of Cambridge's fleet of diesel vehicles are currently running on 20% &lt;a href="w%3Abiodiesel"&gt;biodiesel&lt;/a&gt;, which is "derived from domestically produced vegetable oil," according to the Cambridge Department of Public Works website.

<h1>Second weekend of protests begins in China</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Second%20weekend%20of%20protests%20begins%20in%20China&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Defying government warnings against further demonstrations, as many as twenty-thousand protesters turned out for a second weekend of anti- demonstrations in &lt;a href="w%3AShanghai"&gt;Shanghai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHangzhou"&gt;Hangzhou&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ATianjin"&gt;Tianjin&lt;/a&gt;.

In Shanghai, a crowd broke many windows at the Japanese consulate, according to ♡❤Kyodo News♡❤. The crowd also busted up a Japanese restaurant and set its sign on fire. The protesters then attacked a convenience store, according to the ♡❤Los Angeles Times♡❤.

At the Japanese consulate, the crowd chanted "jia ru, jia ru" asking the police to "join us". The police did not arrest the protesters, and stood by watching as the demonstration proceeded. The police permitted the protesters to throw eggs and rocks. Although the police provided at one point a sign which read "March route this way," state-controlled media denied that the protesters had been given permission for their demonstration.

<h3>Protests spread to Hangzhou and Tianjin</h3>
Southwest of Shanghai, in the city of Hangzhou, an estimated ten thousand protesters demonstrated against Japan, repeating recent demands for a boycott of Japanese products.

"Chinese people are angry," student protester Michael Teng told ♡❤Associated Press♡❤. "We will play along with Japan and smile nicely at them, but they have to know they have a large, angry neighbor," Teng said.

In , &lt;a href="w%3ATiananmen%20Square"&gt;Tiananmen Square&lt;/a&gt; was largely quiet as security tightened in anticipation of tomorrow's visit by Japan's foreign minister, &lt;a href="w%3ANobutaka%20Machimura"&gt;Nobutaka Machimura&lt;/a&gt;. Hundreds of police are guarding both Tiananmen Square and the Japanese embassy.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a statement on Friday seeking to reassure Japanese citizens and businesses operating in China.

"The Chinese government has attached great importance to the situation and has kept on urging the public to express their appeals in a calm, sane, law-abiding and orderly manner and to avoid extreme activities," Chinese State Councilor Tang Jiaxuan said in a press release issued on Friday.

<h3>Reaction from Japan</h3>
As the protests continued in China, Japan lodged a "strong protest" against China.

"We cannot but say that the security system in Shanghai is insufficient," Machimura told reporters.

Despite the protests, Machimura announced that he is not cancelling plans to meet with China's foreign minister &lt;a href="w%3ALi%20Zhaoxing"&gt;Li Zhaoxing&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday to discuss Sino-Japanese relations.

"China has been increasing its regional economic and political influence," Robert Broadfoot, managing director of Political &amp; Economic Risk Consultancy Ltd. told ♡❤Bloomberg♡❤ from Hong Kong. "Japan doesn't want to have its position in the region dictated by China. Japan is adopting a more assertive policy, and China is trying to block it," Broadfoot said.

On Friday, the Japanese government warned its citizens in China to keep a low profile during the protests.

After a promising lead from &lt;a href="w%3APahrump%2C%20Nevada"&gt;Pahrump, Nevada&lt;/a&gt; failed to identify the owner of the notorious "chili finger", doubled their reward on Friday to US$100,000.

Sandy Allman recently lost a finger in Pahrump, when a leopard bit it off. Allman's finger was last seen at a hospital. Coincidentally, Anna Ayala, the woman who found the 'chili finger', also lives in Las Vegas. However, when Allman's prints were sent to San Jose police, they didn't match.

"There is no connection," Sheriff Tony Demeo told the ♡❤San Jose Mercury News♡❤.

<h3>Wendy's sales "down significantly"</h3>
"Our brand reputation has been affected nationally," Wendy's President and COO Tom Mueller said in a statement. "We are determined to find out what really happened in this incident," he continued.

The company revealed on Friday that employees had passed lie detector tests. Wendy's continues to claim that there is no evidence that the finger ever entered their supply chain, pointing to a lack of any accidents among the workers at their suppliers.

Wendy's tip line has received reports from across the United States, from "folks who either have lost a finger, or know somebody who lost a finger," San Jose police Sgt. Nick Muyo told the ♡❤Associated Press♡❤.

The Prime Minister of &lt;a href="Hungary"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AFerenc%20Gyurcsany"&gt;Ferenc Gyurcsány&lt;/a&gt;, has heavily criticised the governments of several other &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; countries over the decision not to start EU accession talks with &lt;a href="Croatia"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt; in March. Hungary is one of the biggest supporters within the EU of Croatia joining the organisation.

Croatia, which has the status of candidate country within the EU, said in 2004 that its target is to join the EU in 2007, along with Bulgaria and Romania, even though the EU has as of yet refused to start accession negotiations, which usually take in excess of two years. For this reason, the earliest Croatia could feasibly join is in early 2010, with accession negotiations ending in late 2007 and a further two full years during which the Accession Treaty is signed and the country prepares for final EU accession.

The country was scheduled to start negotiations in mid-March of this year, but these were postponed indefinitely by the EU, which accused Croatia of its alleged failure to co-operate fully with the International War Crimes Tribunal in the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AHague"&gt;Hague&lt;/a&gt;. The allegation lies on the fact that the EU believes Croatia knows information about the whereabouts of fugitive General Ante Gotovina, accused of ethnic cleansing against the Serbs. The Croatian government has repeatedly maintained that it knows nothing about Gotovina and therefore cannot extradite him to the Hague.

While Hungary wanted negotiations to start in March, a group of countries, led by the United Kingdom, France, Germany and the Netherlands, said that the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASoutheastern%20Europe"&gt;Southeastern European&lt;/a&gt; country is not yet prepared politically to start accession talks.

Hungary also said that it feels pressured by other EU governments to not support Croatia's bid. Prime Minister Gyurcsány said that, "Some diplomats came to us saying that these sort of governments would not be happy if we support Croatia." He went on to say that the case against Croatia starting negotiations is made up only of rumours and allegations without any evidence.

Croatia is home to a a sizeable minority of Hungarians. After fellow EU member Slovenia, Hungary's closest partner country is Croatia. Economic co-operation between Hungary and Croatia is also quite large.

Hungary joined the European Union in 2004, along with several other Central European, Baltic and Mediterranean countries.

When the curtains were drawn and the anthem began, confusion flickered over the faces in the large hall which welcomed the NRA (&lt;a href="%3Aw%3ANational%20Rifle%20Association"&gt;National Rifle Association&lt;/a&gt;) to &lt;a href="Houston"&gt;Houston&lt;/a&gt;. It was the sounds of rocker &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ATed%20Nugent"&gt;Ted Nugent&lt;/a&gt;’s rendition of the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AStar%20Spangled%20Banner"&gt;Star Spangled Banner&lt;/a&gt;. People didn’t know whether to put their hands over their heart, as was customary, or start clapping. According to reports, it was hard to determine what the "Motor City Madman" was doing.

That was the rowdy kick off Friday night of the convention expected to draw up to 60,000 people to the George R. Brown convention center for a weekend of guns, gun-politics, gun peripherals like scopes and carry bags, and stuffed trophy heads.

NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre told about 2000 listeners to "Let the enemies of freedom take notice, we in this room have beaten you…" He repeated it three times for effect.

Another opening act was country singer &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ACharlie%20Daniels"&gt;Charlie Daniels&lt;/a&gt; whose rant against those on the left of the political spectrum included a characterization of them as "save the whales and kill the babies pantywaists." He then pursed his lips and did his interpretation of a pantywaist, according to the Houston Chronicle: "’If we just leave the terrorists alone, they’d leave us alone.’"

Elsewhere, visitors were charmed by stuffed heads of dead deer. NRA staffer Monty Embrey, working the booth with the heads, said that although they looked like small moose, they were full-blooded deer with unusual antlers.

The exhibit is owned by the NRA and travels around the country. "People don't get to see a collection of heads very often. It’s a big deal," said Embrey.

<h3>Tom DeLay is keynote speaker</h3>

Saturday’s keynote address will come from right wing &lt;a href="US%20Congress"&gt;congressional&lt;/a&gt; representative &lt;a href="Tom%20DeLay"&gt;Tom DeLay&lt;/a&gt; of Sugarland, &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, whose district includes much of Houston.

Just Friday, another of DeLay's most conservative associates became the second &lt;a href="US%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House&lt;/a&gt; Republican to ask DeLay to consider yielding his leadership post because of the many ethics problems that have dogged him.

Rep. &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ATom%20Tancredo"&gt;Tom Tancredo&lt;/a&gt;, (R-Colo) said, "If the majority leader were to temporarily step aside so that these trumped up charges can be dealt with in a less hostile environment, as they have proven to be an unnecessary distraction, it may be a productive move." 

These comments follow on the heels of similar statements by Rep. &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AChris%20Shays"&gt;Chris Shays&lt;/a&gt;, a Republican moderate from Connecticut and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARick%20Santorum"&gt;Rick Santorum&lt;/a&gt;, Republican Senator from &lt;a href="Pennsylvania"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;. All are concerned that the man in a political leadership position is a liability to their reelection bids, expected next year. He has not assuaged three charges against him by the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ACongressional%20Ethics%20Committee"&gt;Congressional Ethics Committee&lt;/a&gt;, comprised of half &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARepublican"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; and half &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ADemocrat"&gt;Democratic&lt;/a&gt; members, except to blame his political opposition.

DeLay's record keeping on millions of dollars was minimal and he has allegedly accepted money from Texas corporations in violation of the Texas law.

"A Travis County grand jury indicted DeLay political aide Jim Ellis, fundraiser Warren RoBold and John Colyandro, the executive director of DeLay's political action committee, Texans for a Republican Majority, known as TRMPAC.The Washington Post reported in September that eight corporations also were indicted for illegal political contributions."
The subject of DeLay's speech was not known at press time.

The NRA now claims a membership of about 4 million.

A Paris fire in a hotel killed 22 people, 10 of whom were children, while injuring 53 &amp;mdash; 11 seriously. The hotel was an overcrowded, budget accommodation type of housing. Most of the inhabitants were African, many housed by social services, according to an ♡❤Associated Press♡❤ report.

The 32 room, six-story Paris Opera hotel, was made to house 61 guests, but 90 were staying at the time of the fire, with 84 of them placed by city or state social services.

The fire is thought to have started in the breakfast room at 2:20 am Friday, local time.

Along with the Africans, who were mostly refugees, others wounded included French, Senegalese, Portuguese, Americans, Ukrainians, and Tunisians, according to a report from Turkish ♡❤Zaman.com♡❤. The hotel is situated near to La Galerie Lafayette, Printemps shopping center, and Paris Opera.

It took nearly 250 fire-fighters to control the fire, and the number of casualties was high because of the single exit.

"It’s hard in that kind of situation to tell people to calm down. They jumped. People on the first floor threw their children out the windows," Alfred Millot, head of the fire service at the nearby upmarket Galeries Lafayette department store, told ♡❤Agence France-Presse♡❤.

"With our own equipment, we started fighting the fire from the ground floor. I came running and people were already jumping through the windows," said Millot. 

His store warehouse was used as a temporary morgue. Families were counselled and assisted in re-uniting by the Red Cross.

Starting in 2006, HM passport service of &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt; will begin use of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABiometric%20passport"&gt;biometric chips&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the issuance of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APassport"&gt;passports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Essential to this scheme is the creation of a central database for passport holders that contains fingerprint and biometric data. This database, along with fingerprinting facilities, will be shared by the controversial &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIdentity%20Card"&gt;Identity Card&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; scheme.

The UK Passport Service is a ♡❤royal prerogative,♡❤ meaning the proposals do not require parliamentary approval. Critics say this is an attempt by the government to introduce key elements of the Identity Card scheme by stealth, without approval, appearing to reduce the cost and novel controversiality of the scheme.

The national fingerprint and biometric database is the most controversial element of the British government's Identity Card proposal, which drew debate prior to the recent election. All UK residents would be required to register on a central computer database &amp;mdash; containing at least the fingerprint, iris scan, photograph, address and birth date and place of each resident.

Further information stored on individuals may include police, motoring, financial, health, telephone and email communications and movement data.

This would be used by government agencies including the police, immigration, medical and social security. Access would likely be extended to overseas intelligence agencies such as &lt;a href="CIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Interpol"&gt;Interpol&lt;/a&gt;. Partial access would be given to banks and other parties interested in secure identification.

The database itself may be administered by the private sector. Critics argue that there is huge potential for willful misuse of this personal data.

Speaking to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Guardian"&gt;♡❤The Guardian♡❤&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Democrats%20%28UK%29"&gt;Liberal Democrats'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; home affairs spokesman, Mark Oaten, said the government was trying to hide the true costs of its Identity Card scheme by turning the passport into a biometric identity card.

"The compulsory identity cards scheme is an expensive white elephant and a serious threat to civil liberties. It is an abuse of democracy for Labour to use the royal prerogative to put the nuts and bolts of the system in place without parliamentary approval," Mr Oaten told ♡❤The Guardian♡❤. "There are no international obligations on the UK to put fingerprints in passports. The idea raises important privacy questions which must be properly debated, both in public and in Parliament."

Other elements of the Identity Card Scheme are being trialed and costed under the UKPS. ♡❤Silicon.com♡❤ reports:

"Other projects under way at the UKPS include:"

"- Trials of the Personal Identification Project (PIP), testing the use of data sharing with the private sector and other government departments to strengthen identity authentication"

"- Cutting fraud by creating an electronic link to birth, marriage and death records to eliminate reliance on paper documentation"

"- Launch of an electronic passport application system integrated with UKPS' back-office processing in the third quarter of this year."

"- Creation of a person-centric database. UKPS said there could be significant benefits in storing the data on a person-by-person rather than a passport-by-passport basis."

The British Government has not yet answered critics claims that the scheme is unwarranted and harmful.

&lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;an governments have come under pressure from the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt; to produce passports that incorporate a biometric chip. They have imposed a deadline of 26 October 2005 after which &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;EU&lt;/a&gt; citizens without a biometric chip will require a visa to visit or transit in USA. Presently USA ports take fingerprint and iris scans on arrival.

A premier for the &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, a special 2.6 kilometer pedestrian route was opened last Friday in the "&lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20national%20parks%20of%20the%20Netherlands"&gt;Drents-Friese Wold&lt;/a&gt;" national park, designed specially for the elderly and the impaired.

For the hearing-impaired, sound amplifiers have been implanted on several points along the route. These amplifiers repeat nature sounds specific to the point at a much louder volume. These sounds are changed according to the season.

For the visually impaired, special guide-lines have been placed along the route, leading to special signposts with braille and normal texts.

The route was built with level cement as to make it accessible to wheelchairs and other aids. For the elderly, benches have been placed at 50 meter intervals. A toilet for the disabled is also available.

Funding to cover the 300,000 euro costs were provided by Staatsbosbeheer (national forest administration) and funding by private and commercial sectors.

<h1>Freelance reporter fired from Boston Globe for adding fictitious details to story</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Freelance%20reporter%20fired%20from%20Boston%20Globe%20for%20adding%20fictitious%20details%20to%20story&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Barbara Stewart, former freelance reporter for &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Boston%20Globe"&gt;♡❤The Boston Globe♡❤&lt;/a&gt;, was dismissed this week after adding fictitious details to a story about events which actually did not occur at the time of her writing. ♡❤The Boston Globe's♡❤ Executive Editor &lt;a href="https%3A//bostonglobe.com/aboutus/contact/default.asp%3Ffld%3Dcat%26amp%3Bcrit%3DEditorial_Administration%26amp%3Bexact%3Dy"&gt;Helen Donovan&lt;/a&gt; called the incident a "significant breach" and said, "We should have noticed the lack of attribution on a couple of key facts and should have asked questions we didn't ask."

The story in question was about a Canadian seal hunt that was supposed to take place, but actually did not occur that day because of bad weather. Stewart wrote about it anyway as though it had actually happened. Her article, dated April 13, began, "Over the vigorous protests of international animal-welfare organizations, the largest seal hunt in a half-century resumed yesterday off Newfoundland and Labrador. Hunters on about 300 boats converged on ice floes, shooting harp seal cubs by the hundreds, as the ice and water turned red. Most of the seals were less than 6 weeks old."

"When I read the article, I was kind of shocked," said &lt;a href="http%3A//www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/PD-CP/2005Q1RA_D_E.asp%3Fr%3Dfp825-4-0007"&gt;Phil Jenkins&lt;/a&gt;, spokesman for &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Fisheries%20and%20Oceans%20%28Canada%29"&gt;Fisheries and Oceans Canada&lt;/a&gt;, according to ♡❤The Washington Post♡❤. Jenkins said he told the ♡❤Globe♡❤ that "the events as described in quite vivid detail had not taken place."

The &lt;a href="http%3A//www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/media/infocus/2005/20050316_e.htm"&gt;Canadian hunt&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="w%3AHarp%20Seal"&gt;harp seal&lt;/a&gt; cubs is an annual event that has been drawing protests from animal rights activists since the 1960s. The hunts take place on ice floes and sometimes in weather conditions that can deter protesters from visiting the event.

&lt;a href="https%3A//bostonglobe.com/aboutus/contact/default.asp%3Ffld%3Dcat%26amp%3Bcrit%3DForeign%26amp%3Bexact%3Dn"&gt;James Smith&lt;/a&gt;, Foreign Editor at the ♡❤Globe♡❤, says that the ♡❤Globe♡❤ will now institute stricter hiring practices for future part-time correspondents. He reports Stewart as saying after the incident was uncovered: "I don't know why I did this. I've never done anything like this before."

Stewart has been a reporter for ♡❤The New York Times♡❤♡ Metro Desk between October, 1994 and May, 2004; according to the ♡❤Boston Herald♡❤, the Times denied that Stewart fabricated any parts of stories while she was employed there. This was Stewart's third article for ♡❤the Globe♡❤.

<h2>Other press controversies</h2>

In another example of recent press controversy, &lt;a href="w%3AMitch%20Albom"&gt;Mitch Albom&lt;/a&gt; has been suspended from the &lt;a href="w%3ADetroit%20Free%20Press"&gt;♡❤Detroit Free Press♡❤&lt;/a&gt; for writing ahead of time about the attendance at a &lt;a href="w%3AFinal%20Four"&gt;Final Four&lt;/a&gt; basketball game by two former &lt;a href="w%3AMichigan%20State%20University"&gt;Michigan State University&lt;/a&gt; players, who told him they would be attending but later did not.

Other notable press scandals in recent years have included the &lt;a href="w%3AJayson%20Blair"&gt;Jayson Blair&lt;/a&gt; scandal of numerous fabrications and plagiarisms in 2003 at &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20New%20York%20Times"&gt;♡❤The New York Times♡❤&lt;/a&gt;, which led to the resignation of Blair and two editors.

The ♡❤Globe♡❤ itself has been marked by similar scandals in 1998 which led to the resignation of two columnists, Patricia Smith and &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Barnicle"&gt;Mike Barnicle&lt;/a&gt;, in separate incidents.

&lt;a href="http%3A//www.bu.edu/com/muckraker/mar03/zelnick.htm"&gt;Bob Zelnick&lt;/a&gt;, chairman of the Department of Journalism at &lt;a href="w%3ABoston%20University"&gt;Boston University&lt;/a&gt;, called the current ♡❤Globe♡❤ controversy "embarrassing...a serious problem...a lapse of editorial judgment", but &lt;a href="http%3A//www.bostonphoenix.com/medialog/index.asp"&gt;Dan Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3ABoston%20Phoenix"&gt;Boston Phoenix&lt;/a&gt; characterized the incident as "probably not that big a deal", according to &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Washington%20Post"&gt;♡❤The Washington Post♡❤&lt;/a&gt;. "It was an unknown freelancer writing a fairly small story inside the paper, and they took care of it immediately."

The ♡❤Globe♡❤ published a &lt;a href="http%3A//www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2005/04/15/for_the_record/"&gt;correction&lt;/a&gt; two days later on April 15. It appears from a ♡❤Google♡❤ search that the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.boston.com/news/world/articles/2005/04/13/canadian_seal_hunt_resumes"&gt;prior story&lt;/a&gt; may have been removed from the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.boston.com"&gt;boston.com&lt;/a&gt; website; however, it is currently still accessible in the &lt;a href="http%3A//64.233.179.104/search%3Fq%3Dcache%3AgN9yT8M-uQkJ%3Awww.boston.com/news/world/articles/2005/04/13/canadian_seal_hunt_resumes/%2Bsite%3Aboston.com%2Bice%2Bwater%2Bred%2Bcanada%2Bseal%26amp%3Bhl%3Den"&gt;♡❤Google♡❤ cache&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>Lebanese cabinet talks re-started by new PM</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Lebanese%20cabinet%20talks%20re-started%20by%20new%20PM&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

In the swiftly moving Lebanese political arena, hopes for national elections to come off as scheduled were revived as &lt;a href="w%3A%20Najib%20Mikati"&gt;Najib Mikati&lt;/a&gt; was voted in Friday as the new &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;, replacing former &lt;a href="w%3AOmar%20Karimi"&gt;PM Omar Karimi&lt;/a&gt; who resigned Thursday.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;- and &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;EU&lt;/a&gt;-backed Mikati, a wealthy telecommunications businessman with ties to &lt;a href="w%3ADamascus"&gt;Damascus&lt;/a&gt;, was able to garner anti-Syrian opposition support to secure the nomination in a 128-member parliament vote. He immediately began work Saturday on building a new cabinet, and will continue Monday to build a cabinet team that can create a new government inside a two-week deadline. The government's 4-year parliamentary term ends May 31. Besides the formation of a new cabinet, there must be a confidence vote from parliament, and then the re-drafting of election laws for presentation to the assembly for passage in an approval process.

Lebanon has been without a government since the end of February. The previous prime minister, the pro-Syrian Karimi, replaced the assassinated &lt;a href="w%3ARafik%20Hariri"&gt;anti-Syrian Rafik Hariri&lt;/a&gt;, but was forced to resign under massive opposition protests. Despite his later reappointment by &lt;a href="w%3AEmile%20Lahoud"&gt;President Lahoud&lt;/a&gt;, he again resigned as he remained unable to gain opposition involvement in forming a new cabinet.

The new PM Mikati told a leading newspaper, Al-Nahar, that he intends to form a "restricted government that could hold elections as soon as possible" and sack security service chiefs who he believes would block UN efforts to probe the murder of Hariri.
The sister of Hariri, MP Bahia Hariri, who backed the Migati nomination in her first meeting with President Lahoud since her brother’s killing, said, "We were facing two things: either to enter a constitutional vacuum or offer a compromise, and this is what the opposition chose," according to a report by al-Jazeera.

New research revealed earlier this week indicates that some 257m &lt;a href="w%3Acamera%20phones"&gt;camera phones&lt;/a&gt; were shipped worldwide in 2004. The survey carried out by Strategy Analytics showed that camera phone sales have soared over 200% from 84m in 2003 to the 257m last year.

The huge surge in sales means that camera phone sales now outnumber &lt;a href="w%3Adigital%20camera"&gt;digital camera&lt;/a&gt; sales four to one. The mobile phone market ended the year as follows:

<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="w%3ANokia"&gt;Nokia&lt;/a&gt; - 18 percent market share,
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="w%3AMotorola"&gt;Motorola&lt;/a&gt; - 17 percent,
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="w%3ASamsung"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt; - 13 percent,
BULLET::::- Others - 52.1 percent.

</ul>
Despite the astonishing growth last year, the survey predicts a future increase to more than 350 million camera phones sales this year.

<h1>Levitra ads pulled by FDA</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Levitra%20ads%20pulled%20by%20FDA&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AFood%20and%20Drug%20Administration"&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; (FDA) has penned a stiff reminder to drug giants Bayer Pharmaceuticals Corp. and GlaxoSmithKline PLC: pull your 15-second “reminder” ad for the erectile dysfunction drug, &lt;a href="w%3AVardenafil"&gt;Levitra&lt;/a&gt;, off TV.

FDA said there is no evidence Levitra is better than rival drugs &lt;a href="w%3ASildenafil"&gt;Viagra&lt;/a&gt; from Pfizer, or &lt;a href="w%3ATadalafil"&gt;Cialis&lt;/a&gt;, owned by Eli Lilly and Co., in producing results that make female partners happy.

Levitra and Cialis together control about 30 per cent of the market for such drugs, but Pfizer takes the majority share.

Reminder ads can only call attention to a drug, not claim it works better, or at all.

"In one of [the ad's] scenes, the man strokes the woman's hair and face as she affectionately puts her hand on his wrist," the FDA wrote. "In the other, she puts her arms around his neck and they embrace."
"The totality of the TV ad also represents or suggests that Levitra will provide a satisfying sexual experience from the female partner's perspective," the agency wrote.

Glaxo spokesman Michael Fleming said the drug makers would comply. Bayer developed Levitra and partnered with Glaxo to market the pills in 2001. Bayer recently turned its part of the promotion over to Schering-Plough Corp.

Shares of Bayer fell 75 cents to $32.96 on Friday. Shares of GlaxoSmithKline rose 32 cents to close at $47.82. Schering-Plough shares rose 8 cents to end at $20.65.

The body of Sarah Lunde, a missing 13-year-old &lt;a href="w%3AFlorida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; girl, was found very close to her home Saturday, authorities said.

Lunde's body was found by a search-and-rescue dog in an abandoned fish farm about a half-mile away from her home, according to David Gee, sheriff of &lt;a href="w%3AHillsborough%20County%2C%20Florida"&gt;Hillsborough County&lt;/a&gt;. Lunde had been missing since last Sunday from her home in &lt;a href="w%3ARuskin%2C%20Florida"&gt;Ruskin&lt;/a&gt;, a town to the south of &lt;a href="w%3ATampa%2C%20Florida"&gt;Tampa&lt;/a&gt;.

Gee said the body had a green cast on one arm, just as Sarah did. "The green cast is apparent," he said. He also stated that the body had been in the water for a long period of time, and that an autopsy would be performed to determine the cause of Lunde's death.

"The family is very distraught," Gee added.

According to &lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;, David Onstott, 36, was charged late Saturday night with first-degree murder Gee said. "He is the defendant.",Onstott confessed to the murder.He was arrested on Tuesday on a charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Aside from a 1995 sexual assault charge, Onstott is said to have been sighted at Lunde's house hours after Lunde disappeared, and grabbed a half-empty beer bottle as he left. This could possibly link him to the numerous beer bottles found around the area, which, it is rumored, will be subjected to &lt;a href="w%3ADNA"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt; testing. Onstott was also arraigned on Thursday on charges of not registering as a sex offender and is currently being held in the Hillsborough County Jail. Although his bond was set at $250,000, sheriff's spokesman J.D. Callaway stated that since no bond was set on a Michigan drunk driving warrant Onstott is also being held for, there is no bond set on him for his various other charges, so Onstott is being held without bond for the moment.

This case is now the second such case in a month. &lt;a href="w%3AJessica%20Lunsford"&gt;Jessica Lunsford&lt;/a&gt;'s body was found in Citrus County, north of Tampa, after she had been missing from her home for three weeks.

Convicted sex offender &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Couey"&gt;John E. Couey&lt;/a&gt;, who had been living near Lunsford's home, was arrested and charged with her murder after he confessed.

&lt;a href="w%3AHarvard%20University"&gt;Harvard University&lt;/a&gt; president &lt;a href="w%3ALawrence%20Summers"&gt;Lawrence Summers&lt;/a&gt; announced that the university would take no formal disciplinary action against &lt;a href="w%3AHarvard%20Law%20School"&gt;Harvard Law School&lt;/a&gt; professor &lt;a href="w%3ALaurence%20Tribe"&gt;Laurence H. Tribe&lt;/a&gt; for his admitted "failure to attribute" material used from another scholar's book, the ♡❤Harvard Crimson♡❤ reported on April 15.

The accusation of wrongdoing first appeared in an article in the &lt;a href="w%3AWeekly%20Standard"&gt;♡❤Weekly Standard♡❤&lt;/a&gt; in 2002. The Standard identified several passages in Tribe's 1985 book, ♡❤God Save This Honorable Court♡❤, that they claimed resembled passages in ♡❤Justices and Presidents♡❤, a book written by Henry Abraham of the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Virginia"&gt;University of Virginia&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, the ♡❤Standard♡❤ alleged that the sentence, "Taft publicly pronounced Pitney to be a 'weak member' of the Court to whom he could 'not assign cases,'" appeared in both books. In September of 2004, Tribe admitted to a "failure to attribute some of the material the ♡❤Weekly Standard♡❤ identified," according to the ♡❤Harvard Crimson♡❤.

The ♡❤Crimson♡❤ noted that the press release from &lt;a href="Elena%20Kagan"&gt;Elena Kagan&lt;/a&gt;, dean of the law school and Mr. Summers, stated that they were, "firmly convinced that the error was the product of inadvertence rather than intentionality," although they did describe Tribe's behavior as, "a significant lapse in proper academic practice."

Researchers at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOxford%20University"&gt;Oxford University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are using state-of-the-art technology to uncover works from some of the most important writers of the ancient world, works which have not been read for many centuries. They come from a cache of papyri that were salvaged about a hundred years ago in the Greco-Egyptian town of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOxyrhynchus"&gt;Oxyrhynchus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The ink on many of these &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Apapyrus"&gt;papyri&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; had faded to the point that no text at all was visible to the naked eye, yet using state of the art techniques borrowed from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARemote%20sensing"&gt;satellite imaging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , researchers were able to use &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ainfrared"&gt;infra-red light&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to see the faded ink. 

There are thousands of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Amanuscript"&gt;manuscripts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; which are set to be read in this manner, and works of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASophocles"&gt;Sophocles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEuripides"&gt;Euripides&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHesiod"&gt;Hesiod&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; which have been unavailable for well over a thousand years have already been recovered. The process by which these papyri are reconstructed is very time consuming &amp;mdash; it will take a decade to finish the entire corpus. Among the documents set to be analysed include previously lost writings of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAeschylus"&gt;Aeschylus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOvid"&gt;Ovid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and a series of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChristianity"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Agospel"&gt;gospels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

An international study group report released Thursday calls &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China's&lt;/a&gt; internet censorship "the most sophisticated effort of its kind in the world," and details measures used within China to limit citizen access to internet resources, including the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. The study found though that sites of most &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; news outlets ♡❤were♡❤ available, such as ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMSNBC"&gt;MSNBC&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, and ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AABC"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, as were major anonymizer and human rights sites.

The OpenNet Initiative project (ONI), made up of researchers at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Toronto"&gt;University of Toronto&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHarvard%20Law%20School"&gt;Harvard Law School&lt;/a&gt; in the US, and &lt;a href="w%3ACambridge%20University"&gt;Cambridge University&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;, has a mission "to investigate and challenge state filtration and surveillance practices".

The report, by the project's National Filtering team, and named ♡❤Internet Filtering in China in 2004-2005: A Country Study♡❤, was published on Thursday.

Says the report summary: "ONI sought to determine the degree to which China filters sites on topics that the Chinese government finds sensitive, and found that the state does so extensively."

Topics which were found to be frequently blocked included &lt;a href="w%3Apornography"&gt;pornography&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan"&gt;Taiwanese&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATibet"&gt;Tibetan&lt;/a&gt; independence, &lt;a href="w%3AFalun%20Gong"&gt;Falun Gong&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3ADalai%20Lama"&gt;Dalai Lama&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3ATiananmen%20Square%20protests%20of%201989"&gt;Tiananmen Square&lt;/a&gt; incident, opposition political parties, and a variety of anti-Communist movements.

Volunteers in China who had assisted with the study had done so at "substantial risk", according to John Palfrey, a project leader, speaking at a Congressional hearing in Washington. Palfrey said the filtering was not openly admitted by Chinese authorities, and censorship decisions could not be appealed, encouraging self-censorship.

The report describes the Chinese system as dynamic, pervasive, sophisticated, and effective. Filtering appeared to be carried out at various control points &amp;mdash; unlike systems in other countries &amp;mdash; and a variety of parameters were changing over time.

According to the summary, "This combination of factors leads to a great deal of supposition as to how and why China filters the Internet. These complexities also make it very difficult to render a clear and accurate picture of Internet filtering in China at any given moment."

Most filtering was at the backbone level, with additional controls implemented by individual ISPs, and Chinese search engines, which were found to block results based on particular keywords. Chinese blog providers also were found to prevent or remove content based on particular keywords, or removed the keywords from posts.

Cyber-cafes were legally required to track customer's usage, keeping records for 60 days. This and a patchwork of other laws &amp;mdash; "including media regulation, protections of 'state secrets,' controls on Internet service providers and Internet content providers" &amp;mdash; limited free expression. There was no single statute enacting the censorship.

During the years of the ONI study, the Chinese censorship system was observed to have grown "more refined, sophisticated, and targeted".

Other ♡❤National Filtering♡❤ reports so far released by the group are Bahrain 2004-05, United Arab Emirates 2004-05, and Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 2004; although members have released a number of other reports individually &lt;a href="http%3A//www.opennetinitiative.net/modules.php%3Fop%3Dmodload%26amp%3Bname%3DArchive%26amp%3Bfile%3Dindex%26amp%3Breq%3Dviewarticle%26amp%3Bartid%3D1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

The large &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; retail group &lt;a href="w%3ALittlewoods"&gt;Littlewoods&lt;/a&gt; is set to make 3,200 staff redundant and close 126 of its Index catalogue-based shops. It intends to sell the remaining 33 stores to its largest rival &lt;a href="w%3AArgos"&gt;Argos&lt;/a&gt;.

The firm revealed that it had made accumulated losses at the Index chain of more than GBP 100 million (EUR 146 million, US$190 million) in their 20-year history.

Index currently employs about 4 000 staff, 3 200 will lose their jobs and the rest will be transferred to Argos, which is owned by &lt;a href="w%3AGUS%20Plc"&gt;GUS Plc&lt;/a&gt;. Great Universal Stores Plc, a &lt;a href="w%3AFTSE%20100"&gt;FTSE 100&lt;/a&gt; member, is one of the UK's largest retail firms controlling the successful Argos and &lt;a href="w%3AHomebase"&gt;Homebase chains&lt;/a&gt;. GUS is to pay Littlewoods GBP 44 million (EUR 64 million, US$ 83 million) for the 33 stores.

Littlewoods is owned by &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20and%20Frederick%20Barclay"&gt;Sir Frederick and Sir David Barclay&lt;/a&gt; who bought the business in 2002 for GBP 750 million (EUR 1.1 billion, US$ 1.42 billion).

The company is one in a line of retailers feeling the pinch of consumers spending including &lt;a href="w%3AAllders"&gt;Allders&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Gadget%20Shop"&gt;The Gadget Shop&lt;/a&gt;.

There are rumours around that the Littlewoods chain of stores is also going soon, possibly to the &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20British%20Foods"&gt;Associated British Foods&lt;/a&gt;-owned discount clothing retailer &lt;a href="w%3APrimark"&gt;Primark&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>Croke Park opens to soccer and Rugby</h1>

After intense campaigning during the week, yesterday at &lt;a href="w%3AGAA"&gt;GAA&lt;/a&gt; Congress delegates voted to open &lt;a href="w%3ACroke%20Park"&gt;Croke Park&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3ASoccer"&gt;Soccer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARugby"&gt;Rugby&lt;/a&gt; by 227 votes to 97. The stadium which can seat 82,500, is by far &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Ireland's&lt;/a&gt; largest and indeed one of the largest in &lt;a href="w%3AEurope"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;.

Traditionally soccer and rugby internationals had been played in the much smaller &lt;a href="w%3ALandsdowne%20Road"&gt;Landsdowne Road&lt;/a&gt; stadium, but due to redevelopment it seemed that all internationals would have to be played in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;. However this situation has now been avoided with the vote by delegates to amend Rule 42 to allow soccer and rugby to be played at Croke Park during the redevelopment of Landsdowne Road. The works are expected to take three years to complete.

The international matches that can now be played in &lt;a href="w%3ADublin"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt; are expected to generate several million euros of revenue for the local economy.

Over 20 &lt;a href="w%3AAhwaz"&gt;Ahwazi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AArab"&gt;Arab&lt;/a&gt; protesters in are dead, 500 injured and 250 arrested, in the wake of protests in the border province of &lt;a href="w%3AKhuzestan"&gt;Khuzestan&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; this weekend, says the British Ahwazi Friendship Society (BAFS). The protest erupted after publication of an alleged 1999 letter containing plans for a programme of ethnic "restructuring", purported to be a leak from the office of &lt;a href="w%3AMohammad%20Khatami"&gt;Iranian President Khatami&lt;/a&gt;.

Other reports indicate some dead, but serious discrepancies exist in reports available at time of writing.

A recent Iranian state press agency report on the protest &lt;a href="http%3A//www.irna.ir/irnewtest/en/news/view/menu-235/0504161188192844.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; confirms only that three people were injured, and describes state officials "scrambling" to denounce the letter as forged. "Several state buildings, including banks and police cars were damaged," according to the &lt;a href="w%3AIslamic%20Republic%20News%20Agency"&gt;♡❤Islamic Republic News Agency♡❤ (IRNA)&lt;/a&gt; report.

</ul>
The alleged letter is republished with an English translation &lt;a href="http%3A//www.ahwaz.org.uk/images/ahwaz-khuzestan.pdf"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the BAFS web site. Described is a programme of resettlement and "obliteration of proof of the existence of an Arabic population", which was to include "changing of remaining (Arabic) names of cities, villages, regions and streets to &lt;a href="w%3AFarsi"&gt;Farsi&lt;/a&gt; (Persian language) names" &amp;mdash; the operations to be carried out secretly, and by Arabic-speaking agents.

♡❤Gulf Times♡❤ characterises, the South-Western Iran province as "Arab majority, oil rich".

BAFS says in a Saturday press release &lt;a href="http%3A//www.ahwaz.org.uk/2005/04/irans-bloody-friday-massacre-in-city.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; accompanying their copy of the letter, that State Security Forces (SSF) had arrived and begun shooting at unarmed demonstrators; power, telephone and water had been cut off from the city's Arab districts of Ahvaz; the SSF had besieged the districts, and prevented people from entering or leaving.

♡❤IRNA♡❤ reports a local official at the Khuzestan governor's office, Qodratollah Dehqan, said the area was calm now and the police had the situation under control. Officials were investigating to see whether "the hands of foreign agents and enemies of the revolution are at work".

Also, that Government spokesman Abdollah Ramezanzadeh said the Intelligence Ministry and the Supreme National Security Council had been ordered by President Khatami to identify who was behind the unrest.

Allegedly signed by former vice president Mohammad Ali Abtahi, the BAFS version of the letter stipulates a time-frame of 10 years to accomplish the ethnic restructuring programme, resulting in diluting of the Ahwazi Arab population to one third of the province's total population. Other ethnic groups were to be resettled to the province in order to accomplish this, particularly Azeri (Turks).

Abtahi is quoted by both ♡❤IRNA♡❤ and BAFS, from a website attributed to him: "I have never had the prerogative to order a change of demographic composition."

BAFS says in its press release that even so, a former member of Khatami's staff now living in exile had verified the authenticity of a copy the group received three weeks ago.

Government spokesman Abdollah Ramezanzadeh said in the ♡❤IRNA♡❤ news article, "Following special investigations which were carried out by the presidential office, it became clear that there exists no letter with such a content.

"Furthermore, the content of the letter indicates that it does not comply with any political principles of the Islamic Republic and it is merely aimed at inciting Iranian ethnic groups."

Governor of Khuzestan province, Fathollah Moin, was reported in ♡❤IRNA♡❤: "The aim of the distributors of this forged letter is to disrupt existing solidarity among the people of the province through creating disunity and division and instigating public opinion."

♡❤Gulf Times♡❤ also reports ♡❤Al Jazeera♡❤ as saying the London-based Popular Democratic Front of Ahvazi Arabs in Iran had called for peaceful demonstrations in the area "to mark 80 years of Iranian occupation".

The Norwegian Dawn, a 965-foot-long luxury vessel, was struck by “a freak wave that caused two windows to break in two different cabins,” the owners, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ANorwegian%20Cruise%20Line"&gt;Norwegian Cruise Line&lt;/a&gt;, said in a statement. It changed course, docking in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ACharleston"&gt;Charleston&lt;/a&gt; late Saturday afternoon instead of completing its planned travel to &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;.

The wave, estimated at 7-stories-high, flooded 62 cabins and injured 4 passengers with cuts and bruises. Company spokeswoman Susan Robison said the wave reached to deck 10.

The hull was damaged but the vessel was not in any trouble, according to the Coast Guard, and the safety of the ship “was in no way compromised by this incident.” Passengers were told to don their flotation jackets anyway.

The ship left New York last Sunday on a week-long round-trip cruise to and from the &lt;a href="w%3ABahamas"&gt;Bahamas&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>India, China to jointly construct Buddhist temple in Henan Province</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=India%2C%20China%20to%20jointly%20construct%20Buddhist%20temple%20in%20Henan%20Province&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The governments of India and China have declared in an official memorandum on April 11 their intention to jointly construct an Indian-style &lt;a href="w%3ABuddhism"&gt;Buddhist&lt;/a&gt; temple on the western side of the historic &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20Horse%20Temple"&gt;White Horse Temple&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href="w%3ALuoyang"&gt;Luoyang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHenan"&gt;Henan Province&lt;/a&gt;, China. The project is planned as part of an ongoing effort to increase the ties of friendship and shared culture between the two countries.

The memorandum came in a series of agreements between Chinese Premier &lt;a href="w%3AWen%20Jiabao"&gt;Wen Jiabao&lt;/a&gt; and Indian Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AManmohan%20Singh"&gt;Manmohan Singh&lt;/a&gt;, during Jiabao's state visit to India April 9-12 at Singh's invitation. 

India is expected to provide the funding, architectural design, landscape planning, a &lt;a href="w%3ABuddha"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; idol and other materials for the completed temple. China is offering to provide official cooperation and permits, and facilitate the travel of Indian architects and other construction experts to the site. The temple is planned to be located on 2,667 square meters of land provided by the Chinese government.

<h2>White Horse Temple</h2>

The site of the newly announced temple is said to be in the International Garden of the White Horse Temple in Luoyang.

The White Horse Temple is a site of historic importance to Buddhism. Constructed almost 2,000 years ago in AD 68, the temple is the location first used to introduce Buddhism to China from India. Two &lt;a href="w%3ABhikkhu"&gt;Buddhist monks&lt;/a&gt; from India, Kasyapa Matanga and Dharmaranya, are said to have originally resided there.

<h2>Luoyang, Henan Province</h2>

Luoyang, one of China's seven ancient cities, is located in the central plain of China in the valley of the &lt;a href="w%3AHuang%20He"&gt;Yellow River&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="w%3ALongmen%20Grottoes"&gt;Longmen Grottoes&lt;/a&gt; (or Longmen Caves), another historic site containing thousands of Buddhist sculptures, are located a few kilometers south of there.

Henan Province is located in east-central China, as shown in the above map. It is China's most populous province, with over 96 million residents, mostly &lt;a href="w%3AStandard%20Mandarin"&gt;Mandarin-speaking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AHan%20Chinese"&gt;Han Chinese&lt;/a&gt;. According to Wikipedia, it is traditionally considered to be the source of Chinese civilization.

<h2>India-China relationship</h2>

Many aspects of the India-China relationship were discussed during the official visit. These include:

<ul>
BULLET::::- Discussions of military cooperation, including contacts and exchange of views of high level military officials, such as the current visit of Indian naval Vice Admiral Yashwant Prasad to China during April 11-19, and other naval activities such as the docking of ships. Both India and China are nuclear-armed nations.
BULLET::::- Pushing forward toward mutual agreement on defining the geographical boundary between China and India, called the &lt;a href="w%3ALine%20of%20Actual%20Control"&gt;Line of Actual Control&lt;/a&gt; (LAC). The two countries have been unsuccessful in their attempts to resolve their dispute since the &lt;a href="w%3ASino-Indian%20War"&gt;Sino-Indian border war&lt;/a&gt; of 1962, subsequent decades of military friction and official protests in the 1980s, and peacemaking efforts in the 1990s.
BULLET::::- Trade and economic cooperation between the world's two most populous countries to be increased from the equivalent of US$13.6 billion last year to US$20 billion annually by 2008, and the two governments are studying the benefits of a possible India-China Regional Trade Agreement. China is said to be particularly strong in manufacturing, which complements India's growth in the IT software and services sector.
BULLET::::- The &lt;a href="w%3ATibet%20Autonomous%20Region"&gt;Tibet Autonomous Region&lt;/a&gt; was again recognized to be part of Chinese territory by India, under its long-standing "One China" policy; and India's policy continues to be "that it [does] not allow Tibetans to engage in anti-China political activities in India". Since the &lt;a href="w%3ADalai%20Lama"&gt;Dalai Lama&lt;/a&gt; fled Tibet in 1959, India has played host to the exiled Tibetan government in the town of Dharmsala in the &lt;a href="w%3AHimalaya"&gt;Himalayan Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.
BULLET::::- Many areas of future exchange and reciprocity, including anti-terrorism, scientific exchange, academic, technological, financial, shipping, tourism, film-making, sports, water management, and shared oil and gas exploration in other countries. China is currently the world's third-largest oil consumer, behind only the US and Japan, and its appetite for oil is quickly growing.

</ul>
Leaders of the two countries have declared 2006 to be the "year of India-China friendship" and will be undertaking other cultural exchanges in furtherance of what they call "&lt;a href="w%3ANon-Aligned%20Movement%23The%20Origin%20of%20the%20Non-Aligned%20Movement"&gt;principles of Panchsheel&lt;/a&gt;", or peaceful coexistence. Modern diplomatic relations between the two countries were established 55 years ago after the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949.

India is also currently working on strengthening its relations with the United States, with a current visit to the US by Singh, and a planned visit to India in 2005 by President George W. Bush.

&lt;a href="w%3AManchester%20United"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt; made it to the &lt;a href="w%3AFA%20cup"&gt;FA cup&lt;/a&gt; final after a 4-1 thrashing of &lt;a href="w%3ANewcastle%20United"&gt;Newcastle United&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AMillennium%20Stadium"&gt;Millennium Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ACardiff"&gt;Cardiff&lt;/a&gt; today.

Manchester United, the holders always dominated the game and it only took 19 minutes for &lt;a href="w%3ARuud%20Van%20Nistelrooy"&gt;Ruud van Nistelrooy&lt;/a&gt; to break the deadlock. It appeared that the referee Mike Reilly had awarded a penalty to the &lt;a href="w%3Ared%20devil"&gt;red devils&lt;/a&gt;, but it was a freekick Newcastle's way for &lt;a href="w%3ACristiano%20Ronaldo"&gt;Cristiano Ronaldo's&lt;/a&gt; dive. &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Scholes"&gt;Paul Scholes&lt;/a&gt; added his name to the score sheet just before half-time with a header.

The game was effectively over when Van Nistelrooy scored another one on 58 minutes, a side-foot past Newcastle's 'keeper &lt;a href="w%3AShay%20Given"&gt;Shay Given&lt;/a&gt;. A minute later and Newcastle scored through &lt;a href="w%3AShola%20Ameobi"&gt;Shola Ameobi&lt;/a&gt;, but all hopes of a Newcastle come back were quashed when Cristiano Ronaldo capitalised on van Nistelrooy's generosity to shoot home to make it 4-1 to the reds.

Manchester United will meet &lt;a href="w%3AArsenal"&gt;Arsenal&lt;/a&gt; in the FA Cup final in May.

<h2>Successful docking</h2>
Crewmembers opened hatches between the International Space Station and the newly arrived Soyuz capsule at 12:45 a.m. EDT Sunday to begin almost eight days of joint operations. Cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev and Astronaut John Phillips docked with the orbiting laboratory at 10:20 p.m. EDT Saturday.

European Space Agency’s Astronaut Roberto Vittori of Italy was the third passenger in the Soyuz and he will fly home after 8 days of experiments in the Space Station’s test facility. Going home with him will be two Russian Cosmonauts, Commander Leroy Chiao and Cosmonaut Salizhan Sharipov, who have been on the Station since October. They will provide the new crew with extensive handover briefings as well as training them on the Station’s robotic Canadarm2.

They will leave the Station April 24 in the Soyuz that brought them to the orbiting laboratory. Their landing is scheduled for 6:08 p.m. EDT that day in Kazakhstan.

Highlights of the new Expedition 11 International Space Station crew's mission include welcoming the crew of the Space Shuttle Discovery on its STS-114 mission, the first Shuttle flight since the Columbia accident. Discovery crewmembers will conduct three spacewalks at the Station, deliver several tons of equipment and supplies and return to Earth with equipment and scientific experiments and trash from the Station.

The &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt; bookmaker, &lt;a href="w%3APaddy%20Power"&gt;Paddy Power&lt;/a&gt;, has described this weeks conclave in the Vatican as ♡❤"getting to be a bigger non-sporting betting event than the &lt;a href="w%3AOscars"&gt;Oscars&lt;/a&gt; Hollywood movie awards."♡❤

The bookmaker has been taking bets all week on who will be the next Pope, with &lt;a href="w%3AJoseph%20Cardinal%20Ratzinger"&gt;Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger&lt;/a&gt; the 3-1 favourite. Second favorite was a Frenchman; &lt;a href="w%3AJean-Marie%20Cardinal%20Lustiger"&gt;Jean-Marie Cardinal Lustiger&lt;/a&gt;. The betting firm revealed that one customer has placed €1,000 (US$1,287) on the former &lt;a href="w%3AJew"&gt;Jew&lt;/a&gt;.

In third place is a 78 year old &lt;a href="w%3AItalian"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACarlo%20Maria%20Cardinal%20Martini"&gt;Carlo Maria Cardinal Martini&lt;/a&gt;.

He was also a close confidante of John Paul II who debated with the theologian on Church dogma.

The Aviation and Allied Workers' Union in Nairobi, Kenya, has threatened to suspend operations in 48 hours at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport if the government does not accede to its requests, the East African Standard reported on April 18.

The minister of Labour, Newton Kulundu, "declared the strike illegal and warned that such action would lead to serious consequences," said the Standard. A representative of the union, Jimi Masege, said that the airline was ignoring an order from the registrar of trade unions to collect money from airport workers and give it to the union, Nairobi's Daily Nation said.

Kulundu called on the union to respect the April 14 ruling of what the Nation called an "industrial relations officer," which required the union to refrain from striking. The Standard noted that there was some dispute as to whether the AAWU was properly registered with the government. According to the Daily Nation, Kulundu recommended that the dispute be handled by the state &lt;a href="http%3A//www.labour.go.ke/departments.html%23Court"&gt;Industrial Court&lt;/a&gt; if an agreement could not be reached. 

While some airline operations on April 18 have been disrupted due to bad weather, the union is not planning to strike until Wednesday, April 20.

The &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARomania"&gt;Romanian&lt;/a&gt; Minster for Economy and Commerce, Codruţ Sereş, announced on Friday that his ministry intends to sell 10% of its shares in the state-owned natural gas distributor, Romgaz, this year. The Ministry is still deciding whether to transfer the stock to financial investors or whether to list it on the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABucharest%20Stock%20Exchange"&gt;Bucharest Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt;.

Romgaz is one of the largest state-owned companies in Romania falling under the ownership of the Ministry of Economy and Commerce. In 2005, the company is expected to have an estimated turnover of 648 million &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aeuro"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt;.

Romgaz is the latest Romanian energy company where plans have been announced for privatisation. Last year, the privatisation of natural gas distributors Distrigaz Sud and Distrigaz Nord was proposed, and is expected to be fully completed by the end of this month. Last year, Romanian oil giant &lt;a href="%3Aw%3APetrom"&gt;Petrom&lt;/a&gt; was privatised, in the country's largest ever privatisation, and this year the Electrica Group of electricity distributors was sold off to various financial investors.

As part of the National Anti-Hail Program, five centres that will help in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Ahail"&gt;hail&lt;/a&gt; protection and launch anti-hail missiles if necessary will be built in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3APrahova"&gt;Prahova&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AIasi%20%28county%29"&gt;Iaşi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AVrancea"&gt;Vrancea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ATimis"&gt;Timiş&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AMures"&gt;Mureş&lt;/a&gt; counties. The centre in Prahova county, just west of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABucharest"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt;, is almost finalised and may even be put into operation in this year's winter.

The National Anti-Hail Program was launched in 2000 and is due to be finalised in 2014. It seeks to better protect those areas of the country that are most affected by hail. The project needs investment of 10.9 million new &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARomanian%20leu"&gt;lei&lt;/a&gt; (3 million euro), half of which have already been allocated, according to the project's co-ordinator, Stancu Samoila.

Under the terms of the agreement holders of Macromedia stock will receive 0.69 shares of Adobe stock for every share of Macromedia stock. Macromedia stockholders are expected to own approximately 18 percent of the combined company.

The two companies have in the past been rivals and some of their products compete in similar niches. For example, both &lt;a href="w%3AAdobe%20Photoshop"&gt;Adobe Photoshop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMacromedia%20Fireworks"&gt;Macromedia Fireworks&lt;/a&gt; are graphics editing programs, and both &lt;a href="w%3AAdobe%20GoLive"&gt;Adobe GoLive&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMacromedia%20Dreamweaver"&gt;Macromedia Dreamweaver&lt;/a&gt; are webpage design applications.

In the combined company, the current CEO of Adobe, Chizen will continue as CEO. Stephen Elop, president and CEO of Macromedia, will become president of worldwide field operations. The combined company will keep the name "Adobe", and will focus on integration and growth.

Christopher McCowen, a 33-year-old garbage collector, has been arrested and charged with first degree murder, aggravated rape, and armed assault. Christa Worthington, a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; fashion writer, was found stabbed to death three years ago on January 6, 2002, in her home in &lt;a href="w%3ATruro%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Truro, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;. Her 2-year old daughter, found with her, was unharmed.

The Truro police had already attempted a mass &lt;a href="w%3ADNA"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt; test of all male residents of the town, on the third anniversary of the murder three months before, prompting an outcry from the &lt;a href="w%3AACLU"&gt;ACLU&lt;/a&gt;. McCowen himself had in fact already provided a DNA sample to the police prior to the mass testing, in March 2004.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACambridge%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Cambridge, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
Catherine Ndereba won her fourth Boston marathon yesterday, making her the first woman to do so. The Kenyan trailed for the first 20 miles of the race, before passing Elfenesh Alemu at the top of Heartbreak Hill in Newton. Though the 26.2 mile race takes place in Boston, Massachusetts, it has been dominated by Kenyan and Ethiopian runners for approximately the last ten years. Emily Levan of Wiscasset, Maine, was the first American woman to finish, placing twelfth in 2:43:14. Levan was also 12th in the 2003 Boston Marathon.

Ethiopian Hailu Negussie won the men's race in 2:11:45. American Alan Culpepper placed fourth, the highest an American has placed in the Boston marathon since 1987, when Dave Gordon did the same.

Ernst Van Dyk won the men's wheelchair race for the fifth year in a row. The women's wheelchair race was won by Cheri Blauwet, who also won the event in 2004.

Monday marks the 99th anniversary of the "&lt;a href="%3Aw%3A1906%20San%20Francisco%20earthquake"&gt;Great San Francisco Earthquake&lt;/a&gt;" of 1906. Survivors are becoming harder to find, but about a half-dozen of them gathered at &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ALotta%27s%20Fountain"&gt;Lotta's Fountain&lt;/a&gt; for a wreath-laying ceremony. Lotta's Fountain was the spot used after the earthquake as a collection point for information about victims, both family and friends.

Organizers of today’s event believe they can bring about 60 survivors to next year's .

The &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASan%20Francisco%20Board%20of%20Supervisors"&gt;San Francisco Board of Supervisors&lt;/a&gt; has agreed to change the original statistics of the quake, an estimate of 478 deaths. In time for the centennial, the officially reported number will be revised to account for the some 3 to 6 thousand people who died.

White smoke appeared today at 5.50 p.m. local time over the &lt;a href="w%3ASistine%20Chapel"&gt;Sistine Chapel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ARome"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt; - the first sign that a new Pope had been elected by the &lt;a href="w%3APapal%20conclave%2C%202005"&gt;Conclave of Cardinals&lt;/a&gt;. A few minutes later, the bells of &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Peter%27s%20Basilica"&gt;St. Peter's Basilica&lt;/a&gt; began ringing, confirming the election. Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger had been selected as the successor to as the 265th Pope of the &lt;a href="w%3ARoman%20Catholic%20Church"&gt;Roman Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt;, and will be known as &lt;a href="Pope%20Benedict%20XVI"&gt;Pope Benedict XVI&lt;/a&gt;.

The conclave of 115 &lt;a href="w%3Acardinal%20%28Catholicism%29"&gt;cardinals&lt;/a&gt; started the process of electing a new Pope on Monday, April 18. However, it has taken two days for the required two thirds majority to be reached.

The new Pope appeared to the public within an hour of the first announcement. He appeared on the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica and delivered a short address to the crowd in Italian. Tens of thousands of people were in St Peter's Square to observe the results of the election.

The election of Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger follows the death of Pope John Paul II on April 2.

<h2>Biography</h2>
Pope Benedict XVI, born Joseph Ratzinger (born April 16, 1927) is pope of the &lt;a href="w%3ARoman%20Catholic%20Church"&gt;Roman Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt;. In 1981 Cardinal Ratzinger was appointed prefect of the &lt;a href="w%3ACongregation%20for%20the%20Doctrine%20of%20the%20Faith"&gt;Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith&lt;/a&gt; (formerly known as the Office of the Holy Inquisition) by Pope John Paul II, made a Cardinal Bishop of the episcopal see of Velletri-Segni in 1993, and was elected Dean of the College of Cardinals in 2002, becoming titular bishop of Ostia. He was one of the most influential men in the Vatican and a close associate of the late Pope John Paul II. He presided over the funeral of John Paul II and also presided over the Conclave in 2005. During the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3Asede%20vacante"&gt;sede vacante&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, he was the highest-ranking official in the Catholic Church.

On January 2, 2005, Time quoted unnamed Vatican sources as saying that Ratzinger was a front runner to succeed John Paul II should the Pope die or become too ill to continue as Pontiff. His see, &lt;a href="w%3ACardinal-Bishop%20of%20Ostia"&gt;Cardinal-Bishop of Ostia&lt;/a&gt;, has traditionally been an antechamber to the Papal seat.

However it is important to note that Ratzinger's election to the Papal office was by no means certain. In conclaves men who are considered ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3Apapabile"&gt;papabile&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ often are not elected to office. At times men considered certain to win the election did not win. This is expressed in the saying, "He who enters the conclave as Pope leaves as a Cardinal."

Ratzinger was considered to be Pope John Paul II's "right hand man" and also one of his closest friends and confidants, and during the Pope's final illness, he carried out many of the Pope's functions as leader of the Catholic Church.

Ratzinger has repeatedly stated he would like to retire to a Bavarian village and dedicate himself to writing books, but more recently, he told friends he was ready to "accept any charge God placed on him." After the death of John Paul II on April 2, 2005 Ratzinger ceased functioning as Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.

Ratzinger speaks ten languages and has received seven honorary doctorate degrees. He is an accomplished pianist with a preference for Mozart.

Ratzinger was a member of the Hitler Youth during his teenage years, as was required by &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; law at the time. His father was very strongly anti-Nazi, and Ratzinger himself later deserted the German army.

He is the eighth German pope.

In April, 2005, he was identified as one of the 100 most influential people in the world by Time Magazine&lt;a href="http%3A//dailytelegraph.news.com.au/story.jsp%3Fsectionid%3D1274%26amp%3Bstoryid%3D2946699"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>Armstrong announces retirement from professional cycling</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Armstrong%20announces%20retirement%20from%20professional%20cycling&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

At a press conference Monday, &lt;a href="w%3ALance%20Armstrong"&gt;Lance Armstrong&lt;/a&gt; announced his intention to retire from professional cycling after going for his 7th &lt;a href="w%3ATour%20de%20France"&gt;Tour de France&lt;/a&gt; title in July 2005.

"Ultimately, athletes have to retire," said the 33 year-old American. "The body doesn't just keep going and going."

Speculation on the retirement of the six-time Tour de France winner had been growing in recent months. The Texan had hinted at wanting to spend more time with his children and his cancer charity, the Lance Armstrong Foundation. There was talk he may marry his well-known girlfriend, rock-star singer &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASheryl%20Crow"&gt;Sheryl Crow&lt;/a&gt;.

Armstrong battled with testicular cancer in 1996 before coming back to win the 1999 edition of the legendary French race. He went on to win the next five Tours de France and is now widely regarded as one of the greatest riders in the history of the sport.

Asked about his chances for Tour success, he expressed hope tempered with praise for his opponents. "Can I win this year? I'm not sure, but I'll try... This will be a different year for the Tour with &lt;a href="w%3AJan%20Ullrich"&gt;Jan Ullrich&lt;/a&gt; looking better and a host of young riders coming up," he said.

Should Armstrong follow through with his plans, he will begin his final race in the United States tomorrow at the first stage of the Tour de Georgia. He has successfully used the springtime race in the past as a tune-up to the Tour de France in the summer. The contract with his new team sponsor, the Discovery Channel, obligates him to compete in one more Tour de France.
