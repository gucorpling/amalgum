The ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Gabriel%20Valley%20Tribune"&gt;San Gabriel Valley Tribune&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ said that Powell often had disputes with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APresidency%20of%20George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush Administration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; officials holding what the newspaper termed "more hawkish" views.

On Tuesday, President Bush announced his nomination of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Security%20Advisor%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;National Security Advisor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Dr. &lt;a href="Condoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; as Powell's successor. ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ cited senior Bush administration officials as saying that her deputy, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Hadley"&gt;Stephen Hadley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , will succeed her in her role as Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs if she is confirmed as Secretary of State.

&lt;a href="w%3ASao%20Paulo"&gt;SAO PAULO&lt;/a&gt; – Big Linux 2.0 Beta 3 has been released. Big Linux is a &lt;a href="w%3ALive%20CD"&gt;Live Compact Disc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Brazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;ian &lt;a href="w%3ALinux"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; distribution, based on &lt;a href="w%3AKnoppix"&gt;Knoppix&lt;/a&gt;.

A &lt;a href="w%3ALinux%20distribution"&gt;Linux distribution&lt;/a&gt; is a software set with the Linux operating system and &lt;a href="w%3AGNU"&gt;GNU&lt;/a&gt; software. The source code of Linux and GNU software is freely available and can be legally distributed among users. Big Linux is a ♡❤Live♡❤ Compact Disc version of Linux, which means it may run directly from the CD or optionally be installed on the hard disk.
According to its developers, Big Linux aims to be easy to use and comes with many programs that are used by home users and offices. Some included programs are: &lt;a href="w%3AKDE"&gt;KDE&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJava%20%28programming%20language%29"&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AXMMS"&gt;XMMS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AKaffeine"&gt;Kaffeine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Axine"&gt;xine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AKopete"&gt;Kopete&lt;/a&gt;, YES, &lt;a href="w%3AXChat"&gt;XChat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFullt"&gt;Fullt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AaMSN"&gt;aMSN&lt;/a&gt;, the Windows runtime environments &lt;a href="w%3AWine%20%28software%29"&gt;Wine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACedega"&gt;Cedega&lt;/a&gt;, the peer-to-peer applications &lt;a href="w%3AxMule"&gt;xMule&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABitTorrent"&gt;BitTorrent&lt;/a&gt; and Apollon, &lt;a href="w%3AOpenOffice.org"&gt;OpenOffice.org&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGIMP"&gt;GIMP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAbiWord"&gt;AbiWord&lt;/a&gt;, the email clients &lt;a href="w%3AKmail"&gt;Kmail&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMozilla%20Thunderbird"&gt;Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;, and the internet browsers &lt;a href="w%3AMozilla"&gt;Mozilla&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3Aproprietary%20software"&gt;proprietary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AOpera%20%28web%20browser%29"&gt;Opera&lt;/a&gt; browser.

Some features of version 2.0 beta 3 are: 3 versions of the Linux kernel -- 2.4.25 (for those who use &lt;a href="w%3ASoftmodem"&gt;Winmodems&lt;/a&gt;), 2.4.27 (stable) and 2.6.8 (performance) --, automatic detection of printers, higher boot speed, complete system of network and servers and an automatic hardware detection mechanism. The graphical environment (known as &lt;a href="w%3AX%20Window%20System"&gt;X11&lt;/a&gt;) can have several configurations separated by kernel. In this way, the user can have an accelerated graphical environment configuration and an unaccelerated graphical environment configuration at the same time. If there is some trouble with the accelerated graphical environment configuration, this allows the user to switch to the unaccelerated one.

Big Linux can be downloaded without charge at &lt;a href="http%3A//biglinux.codigolivre.org.br/modules.php%3Fname%3DDownloads"&gt;Big Linux downloads&lt;/a&gt;. This distribution is primarily intended for Brazilian users, although anyone can use it.

&lt;a href="Orlando"&gt;ORLANDO&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; – ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AExtraTERRORestrial%20Alien%20Encounter"&gt;Alien Encounter&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Living%20Seas"&gt;The Living Seas&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ at the &lt;a href="w%3AWalt%20Disney%20World%20Resort"&gt;Walt Disney World Resort&lt;/a&gt; are to open today with a makeover.

The Alien Encounter attraction at &lt;a href="w%3ATomorrowland"&gt;Tomorrowland&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AMagic%20Kingdom"&gt;Magic Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; has been revised to include Experiment 626 from the movie ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALilo%20%26amp%3B%20Stitch"&gt;Lilo &amp; Stitch&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. Now called ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AStitch%27s%20Great%20Escape%21"&gt;Stitch's Great Escape!&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, the dog-like blue creature will lash out of its tube and terrorise the audience. The Galactic Federation's &lt;a href="w%3AGrand%20Councilwoman"&gt;Grand Councilwoman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGantu"&gt;Captain Gantu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAgent%20Pleakley"&gt;Agent Pleakley&lt;/a&gt; appear in this show, essentially a prequel to the movie.

At the Living Seas, &lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20Finding%20Nemo%20characters%23Crush"&gt;Crush&lt;/a&gt; the sea turtle from the &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Walt%20Disney%20Company"&gt;Disney&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="w%3APixar"&gt;Pixar&lt;/a&gt; movie ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AFinding%20Nemo"&gt;Finding Nemo&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ will host a new exhibit called ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ATurtle%20Talk%20with%20Crush"&gt;Turtle Talk&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, joining smaller Nemo exhibits, a mainstay at the attraction for several months. Vegetarian shark &lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20Finding%20Nemo%20characters%23Bruce"&gt;Bruce&lt;/a&gt; will soon become part of a shark education exhibit.

According to publicity, the Turtle Talk show will run every 15 minutes, from 10:00 am to 7:00 pm. A sign language interpreted performance will run on Fridays at 10:30 am.

Disney is holding the &lt;a href="http%3A//disneyworld.disney.go.com/wdw/special/stitch/sweepstakes"&gt;Stitch's Great Escape! Sweepstakes&lt;/a&gt;, with prizes including a five-day, four night trip for four to Walt Disney World Resort.

<h1>Hari Kostov resigns as prime minister of Macedonia</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Hari%20Kostov%20resigns%20as%20prime%20minister%20of%20Macedonia&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3ASkopje"&gt;SKOPJE&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Macedonia"&gt;Prime minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AHari%20Kostov"&gt;Hari Kostov&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Macedonia"&gt;Macedonia&lt;/a&gt; has resigned from his position as of Monday, November 15. The &lt;a href="w%3AAssembly%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Macedonia"&gt;Macedonian parliament&lt;/a&gt; will meet on Thursday to decide whether or not to accept his resignation.

The ♡❤&lt;a href="BBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ quoted Kostov, who was appointed last May, to have said that "there is no will for genuine teamwork" within the coalition, and that one of the parties in the current government has been promoting &lt;a href="w%3Apolitical%20corruption"&gt;corruption&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Anepotism"&gt;nepotism&lt;/a&gt;. Kostov also claimed that the preoccupation with the rights of &lt;a href="w%3AAlbanians%20in%20the%20Republic%20of%20Macedonia"&gt;Albanian ethnic minority in Macedonia&lt;/a&gt; was obstructing economic modernization, according to Reuters. Kostov himself was not a member of any of the coalition's parties.

Kostov's resignation was preceded by a &lt;a href="w%3AMacedonian%20autonomy%20referendum%2C%202004"&gt;referendum&lt;/a&gt; organized by the Macedonian opposition, aimed against a decentralisation law which would have given the Albanian ethnic minority in Macedonia additional rights. The referendum was declared null and void due to a low turnout. According to the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANederlandse%20Omroep%20Stichting"&gt;NOS&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, some now fear that &lt;a href="w%3A2001%20insurgency%20in%20the%20Republic%20of%20Macedonia"&gt;fights&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Liberation%20Army%20%28Albanians%20of%20Macedonia%29"&gt;Albanian guerrillas&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AMilitary%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Macedonia"&gt;Macedonian army&lt;/a&gt;, which came to &lt;a href="w%3AOhrid%20Agreement"&gt;a halt&lt;/a&gt; in 2001, will start again.

&lt;a href="Washington%2C%20D.C."&gt;WASHTINGTON, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Democratic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="United%20States%20Senate"&gt;Senator&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Harry%20Reid"&gt;Harry Reid&lt;/a&gt; has been elected the new leader of the Democratic party in the Senate.

Reid won the position as the &lt;a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; party still holds majority in both houses of &lt;a href="United%20States%20Congress"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADennis%20Hastert"&gt;Dennis Hastert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (R-IL) and &lt;a href="Tom%20DeLay"&gt;Tom DeLay&lt;/a&gt; (R-TX) were re-elected by the Republicans for new terms as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASpeaker%20of%20the%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;Speaker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMajority%20Leader"&gt;Majority Leader&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the &lt;a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;.

Mozilla &lt;a href="w%3AMozilla%20%20Firefox"&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; 1.0, a free &lt;a href="w%3Aopen%20source"&gt;open-source&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AWeb%20browser"&gt;web browser&lt;/a&gt;, has been released on November 9, 2004 by the &lt;a href="w%3AMozilla"&gt;Mozilla&lt;/a&gt; Foundation. 

Some major characteristics of the browser are: pop-up blocking, tabbed browsing, integrated RSS news reader, themes, online fraud protection, extendable with add-ons and multi-platform (it works on &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20Windows"&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALinux"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMac%20OS%20X"&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt;). As of November 16, 2004, there are Firefox versions in the following languages: Norwegian, Polish, Finnish, Italian, Japanese, Greek, Korean, Spanish, Russian, Slovenian, Czech, English, Romanian, German, Hebrew, French, Hungarian, Swedish and Catalan. Other languages should appear later.

Firefox has grown rapidly in popularity, with a Preview Release of the 1.0 version surpassing 10 million downloads in days. The browser has received critical acclaim by some magazines and is seen by many as a real competitor to &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20Explorer"&gt;Internet Explorer&lt;/a&gt;, which currently holds over 90% market share. 
Here's what some reviewers have said about Firefox:

<ul>
BULLET::::- "Move over, Internet Explorer. Feature-studded and secure, Mozilla Firefox 1.0 is a safer, better choice for Internet browsing." &lt;a href="http%3A//reviews.cnet.com/Mozilla_Firefox_1_0/4505-9241_7-31117280.html%3Fpart%3Deditchoice%26amp%3Bsubj%3DMozilla"&gt;CNet&lt;/a&gt;

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- "All told, Firefox is clean and fast. If you want a browser that respects your PC intelligence and helps you get things done, Firefox is a good place to start." &lt;a href="http%3A//www.pcmag.com/article2/0%2C1759%2C1622102%2C00.asp"&gt;PC Magazine&lt;/a&gt;

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- "Despite its small flaws, Firefox is an excellent browser that is within a [sic] two years of unseating Microsoft IE from its throne." &lt;a href="http%3A//netforbeginners.about.com/od/understandyourbrowser/fr/firefox08.htm"&gt;PCWorld&lt;/a&gt;

<h1>Australians talk tough ahead of Brisbane test match</h1>
♡❤November 17, Brisbane, Australia♡❤ - The Australian &lt;a href="w%3Acricket"&gt;cricket&lt;/a&gt; team has brashly talked up their chances of winning the first &lt;a href="w%3ATrans-Tasman"&gt;trans-Tasman&lt;/a&gt; test, which is due to begin in &lt;a href="w%3ABrisbane"&gt;Brisbane&lt;/a&gt; tomorrow.

Bowler &lt;a href="w%3AShane%20Warne"&gt;Shane Warne&lt;/a&gt; has stated that he will be targeting New Zealand captain &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Fleming"&gt;Stephen Fleming&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGlenn%20McGrath"&gt;Glenn McGrath&lt;/a&gt; has revealed that he will be after &lt;a href="w%3ANathan%20Astle"&gt;Nathan Astle&lt;/a&gt;, and Australian batsman &lt;a href="w%3AMatthew%20Hayden"&gt;Matthew Hayden&lt;/a&gt; has vowed to hit New Zealand bowler &lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Vettori"&gt;Daniel Vettori&lt;/a&gt; out of the ground.

The New Zealand team's reaction to this Australian bravado was muted. "It's just history repeating itself", said former New Zealand coach and former test player &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Bracewell"&gt;John Bracewell&lt;/a&gt;. "They just have a set of lines they've been using since I've been coming over here and it's exactly the same story, just a different name saying it. It's just repetitious", he went on to say. New Zealand batsman &lt;a href="w%3AScott%20Styris"&gt;Scott Styris&lt;/a&gt; went further, labelling the Australians' comments as "a yawn".

Australia is widely tipped to win the opening match of the two test series, especially due to New Zealand's loss of frontline players &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Franklin"&gt;James Franklin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADarryl%20Tuffey"&gt;Darryl Tuffey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AShane%20Bond"&gt;Shane Bond&lt;/a&gt; to injury.

Discount retailer &lt;a href="w%3AKmart"&gt;Kmart Corp.&lt;/a&gt; announced Wednesday morning it will buy department store operator &lt;a href="w%3ASears"&gt;Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.&lt;/a&gt;. The deal is to cost $11.5bn and will lead to the creation of the third-largest U.S. retailer, after &lt;a href="w%3AWal-Mart"&gt;Wal-Mart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AHome%20Depot"&gt;Home Depot&lt;/a&gt;, and replacing &lt;a href="w%3ATarget%20Stores"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; at number three.

The new company, which is to be called &lt;a href="w%3ASears%20Holdings"&gt;Sears Holdings&lt;/a&gt; and be based near &lt;a href="w%3AChicago"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, will have $55 billion in annual revenue and nearly 3,500 retail stores. Edward Lampert, the chairman of Kmart, will become the chairman of the new company, while Alan Lacy, current chairman and chief executive of Sears will be the new chief executive. Sears CEO Alan Lacy, speaking about the deal, promised up to $500 million a year in savings within three years from improved efficient, greater purchasing power and possible store closures. The stores will retain their current names.

The purchase will allow the two stores to sell each other's brands, including Craftsman Tools, Kenmore, and &lt;a href="w%3ALands%27%20End"&gt;Lands' End&lt;/a&gt; from Sears, and &lt;a href="w%3AMartha%20Stewart"&gt;Martha Stewart&lt;/a&gt; and Joe Boxer brands from Kmart. The move is considered a boon for Sears, which until recently has confined itself to malls, and can now sell its products in the many Kmart locations.

Shares of both companies soared after the announcement, Sears was up 22 percent on Wednesday, whilst Kmart gained 15 percent.

&lt;a href="w%3AJ_Sainsbury"&gt;Sainsbury's&lt;/a&gt;, the UK &lt;a href="w%3ASupermarket"&gt;supermarket&lt;/a&gt; chain, announced on Wednesday that it had made its first ever loss. For the six months to 9 October, it reported a pre-tax loss of £39m ($72m), compared with a profit of £323m the previous year.

Excluding £168m of exceptional items, such as the clearance of surplus merchandise, Sainsbury's made a pre-tax profit of £131m for the first half of its financial year. The company had made a profits warning earlier in the year. The company's shares actually rose slightly on the news. This is due to the absence of any surprises - shareholders were expecting results in line with these.

Sainsbury's chief executive &lt;a href="w%3AJustin%20King"&gt;Justin King&lt;/a&gt; admitted the firm had been failing to properly stock its shelves after struggling with faulty distribution systems. This problem however is only one of a series of problems that has plagued Sainsbury's in recent years. Once the UK's largest supermarket chain, Sainsbury's has been overtaken by both &lt;a href="w%3ATesco"&gt;Tesco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AASDA"&gt;Asda&lt;/a&gt; in recent years.

<h1>Chinese submarine enters Japanese waters</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Chinese%20submarine%20enters%20Japanese%20waters&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Tenuous relations between &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; were strained last week when a Chinese nuclear-powered &lt;a href="w%3Asubmarine"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt; entered Japanese territorial waters southwest of &lt;a href="w%3AOkinawa"&gt;Okinawa&lt;/a&gt;.

The intrusion occurred on 10 November, Japanese time (UTC+9). The submarine was quickly spotted by Japan's &lt;a href="w%3AJapan%20Self-Defence%20Forces"&gt;Self-Defence Forces&lt;/a&gt; and was tracked by &lt;a href="w%3Ahelicopter"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt; as it wandered in Japanese waters for two hours before moving north-west. &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20law"&gt;International law&lt;/a&gt; requires a tracked submarine to surface and identify its &lt;a href="w%3Anationality"&gt;nationality&lt;/a&gt; in times of peace; the submarine did not do so.

Many Japanese officials in the Defence Agency considered the intrusion an act of provocation and "showing off," as the submarine in question was a particularly noisy model. It continued traveling very slowly after being spotted, and remained in shallow waters. The intrustion caused Japanese Self-Defense Forces to go on alert for the second time since the Second World War.

The submarine in question is believed to be a Type 09-1 Han Class &lt;a href="w%3AAttack%20submarine"&gt;attack submarine&lt;/a&gt;. It is a nuclear-powered submarine designed in the 1950s and first built in the 1974. This class of submarine is thought to suffer numerous defects, including radiation leakage, noise, and an inability to fire missiles while submerged. Only two of five submarines are thought to be operational. China has recently begun an active modernization of its &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Liberation%20Army%20Navy"&gt;navy&lt;/a&gt;.

On 17 November, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Wu Daiwei met with the Japanese &lt;a href="w%3Aambassador"&gt;ambassador&lt;/a&gt; to China Anami Koreshige in &lt;a href="w%3ABeijing"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt; and offered an apology for the incident, stating that the submarine was on a training mission and the intrusion was due to a "technical error" and was "regrettable." Japan's Defence Agency is studying whether "technical errors" is a feasible explanation for the incident.

Japanese &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minster%20of%20Japan"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJunichiro%20Koizumi"&gt;Koizumi Junichiro&lt;/a&gt; has publicly stated he wishes to speak with Chinese &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AHu%20Jintao"&gt;Hu Jintao&lt;/a&gt; about this and other matters of Sino-Japanese contention at the upcoming annual &lt;a href="w%3AAsia-Pacific%20Economic%20Cooperation"&gt;Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation&lt;/a&gt; summit in &lt;a href="w%3AChile"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt; later this month.

Despite the increasingly close economic ties between the two nations, distrust has long exisited between Japan and China. Many Chinese people still resent the Japanese invasion and &lt;a href="w%3ASino-Japanese%20War%20%281937-1945%29"&gt;occupation of China&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20War%20II"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; and Japan's refusal to formally apologise. Japan, on the other hand, sees China as a potential competitor and an increasing threat to its national security.

&lt;a href="w%3AConstitution%20of%20Japan"&gt;Japan's Constitution&lt;/a&gt; forbids the nation from exercising military strength in matters other than that of &lt;a href="w%3Aself-defence"&gt;self-defence&lt;/a&gt;, but Japan's ruling party, the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Democratic%20Party%20%28Japan%29"&gt;Liberal Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; or LDP, has recently proposed constitutional amendments to give the military more offensive capabilities, among other things.

On Wednesday &lt;a href="North%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;'s official media dropped &lt;a href="Kim%20Jong%20Il"&gt;Kim Jong Il&lt;/a&gt;'s honourific title "Dear leader", reported Japan's Radiopress. It was only days after the Russian news agency &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AItar-Tass"&gt;Itar-Tass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; reported that portraits of Kim Jong Il have recently been removed from public display in North Korea.

According to Radiopress, a Japanese news agency that monitors North Korea's radio broadcasts, the North's Korean Central Broadcasting Station, as well as the Korean Central News Agency and other North Korean media, have stopped using the term "Dear leader" when referring to Kim Jong Il, the country's supreme leader. Now the media in North Korea only use the official titles "General Secretary of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWorkers%27%20Party%20of%20Korea"&gt;Workers' Party of Korea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ", " the Chairman of the DPRK National Defense Commission" and/or "Supreme Commander of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKorean%20People%27s%20Army"&gt;Korean People's Army&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; " when referring to Kim.

Earlier Itar-Tass also reported that according to an unnamed foreign diplomat in Pyongyang, Kim Jong Il's portraits have recently been taken down from public display secretly and without explanation. However, the portraits of Kim's father, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKim%20Il%20Sung"&gt;Kim Il Sung&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , still remain, according to the same report. This report has been confirmed by some expatriates living in the country.

This recent development in North Korea has given rise to speculation among analysts, some of whom suspected that these may be a sign that Kim is losing power, or that a power struggle is going on among the top leaders of the totalitarian state. But most observers believe that the portraits were taken down by the order of Kim Jong Il himself, who might be trying to downsize his own personality cult. "We believe the change was made at his will to soften his image as a leader of a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Apersonality%20cult"&gt;personality cult&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , although it is hard to determine what his real intentions are," said Shinya Kato, the editor of Radiopress.

&lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;n officials are not yet speculating on the matter, saying the portrait removals "may be for various reasons."

North Korea is one of the few &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStalinism"&gt;Stalinist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; states that still exist today, and the political control in the country remains tight. In recent years North Korea underwent several minor reforms that did not appear to significantly improve quality of life. It has also remained largely mysterious and secretive to the outside world, as few foreign correspondents are allowed to visit and stay in the country.

GAZA - The &lt;a href="w%3AIsraeli%20Defense%20Force"&gt;Israeli Army&lt;/a&gt; is believed to have killed three &lt;a href="w%3AEgypt"&gt;Egyptian&lt;/a&gt; soldiers in a border incident. The shootings occurred near the &lt;a href="w%3APhiladelphi%20Route"&gt;Philadelphi Route&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="w%3AGaza"&gt;Gaza&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3AEgypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt; border. Both nations patrol the area intensively for &lt;a href="w%3Aarms%20smuggling"&gt;arms smuggling&lt;/a&gt; into Gaza.

An Israeli tank apparently mistook Egyptian troops for smugglers.

Foreign ministry spokesman Mark Regev has apologized for the incident, saying: "If Egyptians were hit then we regret it. This was not our intention. We want good co-operative relations with Egypt ... and if Egyptians were hurt then our thoughts go out to them and their families and the Egyptian people."

Israel has said it is investigating the shootings "at the most senior level." Egypt has said little so far.

<h1>Kanchi Shankaracharya Jayendra Saraswathi in custody</h1>
♡❤Thursday, November 18 2004, Kancheepuram, Tamil Nadu, India.♡❤ Kanchi Mutt seer Sri Jayendra Saraswathi has been remanded to 5 day's police custody in the South Indian town of &lt;a href="w%3AVellore"&gt;Vellore&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AJayendra%20Saraswathi"&gt;Jayendra Saraswathi&lt;/a&gt; is the senior &lt;a href="w%3APontiff"&gt;pontiff&lt;/a&gt; of the 2500 year old Kanchi Mutt, situated in Kancheepuram in the &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20India"&gt;South Indian state&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ATamil%20Nadu"&gt;Tamil Nadu&lt;/a&gt;. He is also a prominent religious leader both because of the stature of the Mutt and the Mutt's large number of devotees but also for his active but unsuccessful role in resolving the &lt;a href="w%3ABabri%20Mosque"&gt;Ayodhya dispute&lt;/a&gt;.

The seer was arrested on 11 November, 2004 at Mahboobnagar, about 150 km from &lt;a href="w%3AHyderabad"&gt;Hyderabad&lt;/a&gt; of directing the murder of A.Sankararaman, a former Manager of the Mutt.
&lt;a href="w%3ATamil%20Nadu"&gt;Tamil Nadu&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AChief%20Minister"&gt;Chief Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJayalalitha"&gt;J. Jayalalithaa&lt;/a&gt; said on Wednesday, November 17 2004 that the arrest was made since they had solid evidence. 
The evidence was in the form of a statement by two of the prime accused in the case confirming his invovlement, huge sum of money drawn to pay for the murder and telephone conversations with the killers.

<h1>Kyoto Treaty becomes legally binding on February 16</h1>
♡❤November 18 2004, Nairobi.♡❤ The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; has announced that the &lt;a href="w%3AKyoto%20Treaty"&gt;Kyoto Treaty&lt;/a&gt;, which its signatories claim will counter the &lt;a href="w%3Agreenhouse%20effect"&gt;greenhouse effect&lt;/a&gt; and global climate changes, will take effect on February 16, 2005. 

The treaty could not be made legally binding to those countries who signed it earlier, the BBC reports, because they did not make up for the required 55% of the world's emission of greenhouse gases. Last month, &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; announced they would sign the treaty, pushing that percentage to 55%. Andrei Denisov, Russia's ambassador to the United Nations, handed &lt;a href="w%3AKofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt; the official papers today.

Several industrialized nations around the world have refused to ratify the Kyoto Treaty, in particular the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20of%20America"&gt;United States of America&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;. The governments of both countries argue that signing the protocol would cause an estimated 3% decline in GDP, and thus stagnation of their economies, while resulting in only small total greenhouse gas reductions worldwide. The also point out that other major nations, notably China, are extempt from the treaty provisions.

In the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3Amusic%20video"&gt;music video&lt;/a&gt; for this &lt;a href="w%3AChristmas"&gt;Christmas'&lt;/a&gt; remake of the charity single ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ADo%20They%20Know%20It%27s%20Christmas%3F"&gt;Do They Know It's Christmas?&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ was launched simultaneously today (Thursday) on several UK and &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt; television channels including &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20One"&gt;BBC One&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20Two"&gt;BBC Two&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARTE%201"&gt;RTE 1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AITV1"&gt;ITV1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AChannel%204"&gt;Channel 4&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ASky%20One"&gt;Sky One&lt;/a&gt;. The debut was made at 17:55 GMT. 

The song was originally recorded in 1984 by several of the biggest artists of the time including &lt;a href="w%3ABono"&gt;Bono&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Bob%20Geldof"&gt;Bob Geldof&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20McCartney"&gt;Paul McCartney&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Michael"&gt;George Michael&lt;/a&gt;. This year, in celebration of 20 years since the first single, the song has been remade by over 50 of today's best selling artists, including &lt;a href="w%3AColdplay"&gt;Coldplay&lt;/a&gt; frontman &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Martin"&gt;Chris Martin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARobbie%20Williams"&gt;Robbie Williams&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABono"&gt;Bono&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJustin%20Hawkins"&gt;Justin Hawkins&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Darkness"&gt;The Darkness&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ADido"&gt;Dido&lt;/a&gt;. 

The song, which is in aid of charity, is already tipped to be the Christmas No. 1 in the UK and Ireland. The song will also be launched as a charity mobile phone &lt;a href="w%3Aringtone"&gt;ringtone&lt;/a&gt; to raise funds for &lt;a href="Sudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt;'s troubled &lt;a href="w%3ADarfur"&gt;Darfur&lt;/a&gt; region. Mycokemusic.com said it was going to put the track on its website from Thursday with all profits to be donated to charity. The single will be available to buy in shops from the 29 November.

&lt;a href="Rhode%20Island"&gt;RHODE ISLAND&lt;/a&gt; – Television reporter &lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Taricani"&gt;Jim Taricani&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href="w%3AConviction"&gt;convicted&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ACriminal%20contempt"&gt;criminal contempt&lt;/a&gt; Thursday for not revealing to authorities the source of a video that he had received and reported on. The video had been sealed to prevent the public from seeing it. 

&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20District%20Court"&gt;US District Court&lt;/a&gt; Judge Ernest Torres convicted Taricani, a reporter for WJAR-TV News in &lt;a href="w%3AProvidence%2C%20Rhode%20Island"&gt;Providence&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARhode%20Island"&gt;Rhode Island&lt;/a&gt;. The video in question showed the city's mayor, Vincent Cianci, taking a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;1000 bribe. The official was subsequently convicted for corruption. During Cianci's trial, the court had ordered the video to be sealed. It was subsequently released to reporter Jim Taricani. Torres opined that the leak had been designed to prevent a fair trial and, as the video was sealed, the person who leaked it had broken the law.

Taricani's refusal to identify the leaker had been the basis for his conviction of &lt;a href="w%3Acivil%20contempt"&gt;civil contempt&lt;/a&gt; on March 16. A USD $1000 fine was to be issued every day until Taricani revealed his source. He has paid all fines, and was reimbursed by WJAR-TV News for all expenses. Torres suspended the fine, calling it ineffective.

Taricani defended his action, saying: "I made a promise to my source, which I intend to keep."

Prosecutions for not revealing sources are becoming an increasingly common occurrence. Eight journalists have been convicted in recent months. Speaking in an interview Wednesday, he said, "I'm proud to be a part of this effort with other reporters who are facing this same thing."

&lt;a href="w%3ASentencing"&gt;Sentencing&lt;/a&gt; is to take place December 9th. Torres has said Taricani will receive no more than six months due to ill health.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Knight%20to%20Leave%20Nike%20Top%20Job&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Reuters has reported that &lt;a href="w%3APhil_Knight"&gt;Philip Knight&lt;/a&gt;, co-founder of shoe giant &lt;a href="w%3ANike%252C_Inc."&gt;Nike, Inc.&lt;/a&gt; will step down as the company's CEO and President on December 28. He will be replaced by William Perez, current CEO of &lt;a href="w%3ASC_Johnson"&gt;S.C. Johnson &amp; Son, Inc.&lt;/a&gt;

While industry experts consider this to be a good move as the company looks to expand beyond its core market, analyst Jamelah Reddy expressed surprise that an individual from outside the company was brought in rather than tapping one of Nike's co-presidents. Reddy said Knight was "leaving big shoes to fill."

The move is a blow to activist organizations which have targeted the company for its use of sweatshop labor and other practices. For example, the progressive anti-consumerism magazine ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAdbusters"&gt;Adbusters&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ recently introduced their "Black-Spot Sneaker" which they promote as being "for just one thing: kicking Phil Knight's ass". 

Nike spokesman Kirk Stewart said Perez was chosen for his experience in dealing with international markets and brand-building, an important skill as Nike continues expansion internationally. Nike's international sales now surpass domestic sales, reports Bloomberg.

According to ESPN, Knight was responsible for Nike's endorsement contract with &lt;a href="w%3AMichael_Jordan"&gt;Michael Jordan&lt;/a&gt;, signed in 1984 when he was still a rookie with the Chicago Bulls. Jordan said of Knight, "To me, Phil Knight will always be recognized as a sports marketing visionary -- he will always be a part of Nike. I learned so much about the industry from him and will always admire his drive and creativity."

Knight, who according to Forbes gave no reason for his departure, intends to retain his position as the chairman of Nike's board of directors. He will also hold on to his 28% voting share in the corporation, as well as his 92% share of the non-voting stock.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANairobi"&gt;NAIROBI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; – Representatives of both the &lt;a href="Sudan"&gt;Sudanese&lt;/a&gt; government and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASPLM"&gt;SPLM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) signed a peace pledge today in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKenya"&gt;Kenyan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; capital &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANairobi"&gt;Nairobi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , under the watchful eye of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aambassador"&gt;ambassadors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

According to the &lt;a href="BBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;, the document concluded with a memorandum saying that "prompt completion of the peace process is essential for all the people of Sudan". The actual peace treaty should, according to the pledge, be signed no later than December 31st 2004. While the pledge focuses mainly on the fights between the rebels in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Sudan"&gt;south&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the Khartoum-based government in the north, there is also attention for the ongoing crisis in east Sudan (&lt;a href="Darfur"&gt;Darfur&lt;/a&gt;).

Several aid agencies have criticized the UN for taking a weak stand against the Sudanese government. The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Security%20Council"&gt;Security Council&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has already signed two resolutions threatening economic sanctions against Sudan if the government does not disarm its troops in Darfur, but, so the BBC reports, the violence is continuing. The civil war in Darfur was sparked in 2003, when insurgents started attacking government buildings. The Arab government in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKhartoum"&gt;Khartoum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; subsequently sent troops to the region, which have been reported to mass-violate human rights of the black Africans living in Darfur.

MOSUL, Iraq – &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; soldiers fighting in &lt;a href="w%3AMosul"&gt;Mosul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; discovered up to twelve &lt;a href="w%3ABeheading"&gt;beheaded&lt;/a&gt; bodies in the western part of the city, the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Times"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; has reported. The bodies are believed to be those of &lt;a href="w%3AIraqi%20National%20Guard"&gt;Iraqi soldiers&lt;/a&gt; killed for assisting &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Army"&gt;U.S. forces&lt;/a&gt; in eliminating &lt;a href="w%3AIraqi%20resistance"&gt;local resistance&lt;/a&gt;; however, no identification has been made.

The bodies were found after a Jordanian named Abu Musab al-Zarqawi made an Internet posting in which he claimed that two Iraqi National Guard officers had been publicly decapitated in Mosul. A local businessman, Senan Shukri, claims to have witnessed the executions, stating that all onlookers had been warned that if they moved or otherwise disturbed the bodies they, too, would be beheaded.

According to Lt. Col. Erik Kurilla of the 24th &lt;a href="w%3AInfantry%20Regiment"&gt;Infantry Regiment&lt;/a&gt;, high-ranking officials in the &lt;a href="w%3AIraqi%20National%20Guard"&gt;Iraqi National Guard&lt;/a&gt; have been notified of the claimed beheadings; he states, however, that they have been unable to determine if any of their &lt;a href="w%3Aofficer"&gt;officers&lt;/a&gt; were missing, pointing out that many were on leave and thus difficult to track down in any circumstance.

The bodies have not yet been removed by U.S. troops for fear that they might trigger &lt;a href="w%3ABooby%20traps"&gt;booby-trapped&lt;/a&gt; explosives.

Bahia, Brazil – 
About 250 people from the &lt;a href="w%3ALandless%20Workers%27%20Movement"&gt;MST&lt;/a&gt; (Movimento dos Sem Terra, in Portuguese) or Brazilian Landless Workers Movement has invaded a 223 &lt;a href="w%3Ahectare"&gt;hectares&lt;/a&gt; farm in the city of &lt;a href="w%3AUbaitaba"&gt;Ubaitaba&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABahia"&gt;Bahia&lt;/a&gt;. According to Agência Folha, Fernando Rodrigues da Silva, 34 members of the movement says they want to press the Brazilian government institute called Incra (National Institute of Colonization and the Agrarian Reformation) to look after their cause.

Raul Pinto Farias, owner of the farm has said he will demand the expulsion of MST out of his property before the Court of Law.

The MST is a &lt;a href="w%3AMarxist"&gt;Marxist&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3AMaoist"&gt;Maoist&lt;/a&gt; inspired movement of landless peasants in Brazil. According to MST, in 2003 &lt;a href="http%3A//www.mst.org.br/biblioteca/acampam/acamp2003.htm"&gt;there were about 632 MST camps in Brazil&lt;/a&gt;. MST is a large organization with many settlements throughout Brazilian countryside, especially in the Brazilian Northeast. Their main visible tactic is invading lands around the country.

MST says they fight for agrarian reformation and justice in Brazil. Some Brazilians have already protested against MST tatics, saying they are against the law and are violent. Currently, MST funds itself by selling produce grown on its agricultural cooperatives and from donations from international organizations. Also the movement receives funds by selling &lt;a href="http%3A//store.gxonlinestore.org/strongroots.html"&gt;videos of their invasions&lt;/a&gt;.

YANGON, Myanmar – Nineteen Burmese political prisoners, including pro-democracy leader Min Ko Naing, have been freed by &lt;a href="w%3ABurma"&gt;Burma&lt;/a&gt;'s military junta after it declared their imprisonments invalid, the Associated Press reports.

The releases came after the current regime under Soe Win dissolved the National Intelligence Bureau run by Prime Minister General Khin Nyunt, who was ousted last month. The Burmese state-run television and radio network claimed that the NIB had wrongly charged 3,937 prisoners.

Min Ko Naing had been imprisoned since 1988 after leading pro-democracy protests that were quickly crushed by the ruling regime. In total, three senior members of Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy were released. Aung San Suu Kyi herself has been under house arrest since May 2003 following a violent confrontation between loyalists and her dissidents.

At least one NLD member expressed optimism about the new development. 77-year-old Ohn Maung, an NLD member freed on Friday after being imprisoned since 1998, told &lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt; "It was a pleasant surprise for all of us." He added, "I did not have to sign any undertaking and I expect most of the NLD members will also be released like me."

&lt;a href="w%3AUN"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; Secretary-General &lt;a href="Kofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt; released a statement in which he said that he is "encouraged by reports that a number of people detained for political activities are included among [the prisoners released]." He also called for the release of all remaining political opponents and dissidents, either from prison or from house arrest.

According to witnesses outside Yangon's Insein Prison, altogether approximately 200 prisoners--most serving terms for minor criminal offenses--were released Friday.

Although Burma's military regime changed the country's name to &lt;a href="w%3AMyanmar"&gt;Myanmar&lt;/a&gt; in 1989--a change recognized by the United Nations--many national governments and a large portion of the Burmese population still use the name "Burma" because they do not recognize the legitimacy of the junta that instituted the change.

Four &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Basketball%20Association"&gt;National Basketball Association&lt;/a&gt; players have been suspended indefinitely for their actions during a brawl at the end of the Friday, November 19th game between the &lt;a href="w%3ADetroit%20Pistons"&gt;Detroit Pistons&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AIndiana%20Pacers"&gt;Indiana Pacers&lt;/a&gt;. 

&lt;a href="w%3ARon%20Artest"&gt;Ron Artest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJermaine%20O%27Neal"&gt;Jermaine O'Neal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Jackson"&gt;Stephen Jackson&lt;/a&gt; of the Pacers and &lt;a href="w%3ABen%20Wallace"&gt;Ben Wallace&lt;/a&gt; of the Pistons learned of the length of their suspensions on Sunday. Ron Artest has been suspended for the rest of the season, Stephen Jackson for 30 games, Jermaine O'Neal for 25, and Ben Wallace for 6. Pacers guard Anthony Johnson received a 5 game suspension. In addition, Reggie Miller from Indiana, and Detroit Pistons Chauncey Billups, Elden Campbell and Derrick Coleman were each suspended one game for leaving their bench. 

The brawl began with 45.9 seconds left in the game, as Ben Wallace shoved Ron Artest after a particularly hard foul by Artest. That was settled quickly, but a fan then threw a cup at Artest as the referees were handling the aftermath of the fight, and Artest went into the stands, and began throwing punches. Jackson then joined in and began to throw punches as well. Due to the brawl the game was called, and ended with 45.9 seconds left. The Pacers were ruled the winner. 

Artest has had a history of suspensions before this incident. Last season he was suspended twice, once for leaving the bench during a fight, and once for elbowing Portland player &lt;a href="w%3ADerek%20Anderson"&gt;Derek Anderson&lt;/a&gt;. He was suspended 5 times during the 2002-2003 season.

&lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;an finance ministers at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AG-20"&gt;G-20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; meeting which opened Saturday, November 20th, are expected to discuss the current exchange rate of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aeuro"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; vs. the &lt;a href="United%20States%20dollar"&gt;dollar&lt;/a&gt;. The euro is currently trading high against the dollar, so that it takes around $1.34 (as of December 4, 2004) to buy one euro. This has the effect of making exports from Europe to the USA more expensive, increasing the likelihood that &lt;a href="US"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; consumers will buy from a non-&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEU"&gt;EU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; country. The exchange rate is set by the currency markets, although it is heavily influenced by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acurrent%20account"&gt;current account&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; status (ie. the balance of trade between countries).

Some European leaders want the United States to take action to increase the value of its exchange rate. The US though is seen as not wanting to do this, for two reasons:
<ol>
BULLET::::1. A low dollar relative the euro means that all exports from the US to Europe are cheaper for Europeans to buy, increasing the likelihood that Europeans will buy US items and thus helping the US economy
BULLET::::2. Many actions which governments have done in the past to bolster unnaturally their currency have been fought by the market, and the market won. The most famous example is George Soros' "breaking of the Bank of England"

</ol>
One side-issue that this discussion might evoke is that of the exchange rate between the dollar and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChinese%20yuan"&gt;Chinese yuan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which is fixed by &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;. Studies of this exchange rate using the concept of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Apurchasing%20power%20parity"&gt;purchasing power parity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (ensuring that a dollar traded to Chinese yuan will still buy roughly the same amount in China) show that the Chinese yuan has been around 50% undervalued for the past two years. This makes things from China on average 50% cheaper for a US consumer than they should be. US officials have throughout 2004 repeatedly called for China to end this practice. Normally it would end itself, i.e. even with a fixed exchange rate this process could only go on for so long before the entire Chinese market becomes valued differently. But since the Chinese central bank has been constantly lending money to the United States government (via the purchasing of US treasury bonds), that effect is mitigated.

Seven unknown men armed with guns invaded the ♡❤Terra Prometida♡❤ camp, in &lt;a href="w%3AFelisburgo"&gt;Felisburgo&lt;/a&gt;
city, &lt;a href="w%3AMinas%20Gerais"&gt;Minas Gerais&lt;/a&gt;, Brazil, and killed five members of the
Brazilian Landless Workers Movement movement (&lt;a href="w%3ALandless%20Workers%27%20Movement"&gt;MST&lt;/a&gt;). The ♡❤Terra Prometida♡❤ camp
had been invaded by the MST in May 2002 and there were about 200 MST families
living there at the time of the attack. 

According to the Brazilian newspaper Agência Folha, police said 13 of the
members of the MST movement were injured and five died. Four of them are still
hospitalized. Two of them, Joaquim Batista da Silva and his son (a 12-year-old
child), are in the Felisburgo Municipal Hospital. The other two, Valdemar
Barbosa Lima and José Maroto Lima, are in the Santa Rosária Hospital in
&lt;a href="w%3ATe%C3%B3filo%20Otoni"&gt;Teófilo Otoni&lt;/a&gt; city.

According to MST camp leaders the gunfighters set fire to MST tents and started
shooting. 

The police are investigating the case. The &lt;a href="w%3APartido_dos_Trabalhadores"&gt;Workers
Party (PT)&lt;/a&gt; has demanded the gunfighters' arrest and punishment.

The MST is an ideologically diverse movement of
agricultural workers in Brazil officially founded in 1984. MST is for the equitable redistribution of Brazilian farmland. According to MST, in
2003 there were about &lt;a href="http%3A//www.mst.org.br/biblioteca/acampam/acamp2003.htm"&gt;632 MST camps in Brazil&lt;/a&gt;. MST is a large organization with many bases throughout
Brazilian cities. Their most visible tactic has been the occupation of mostly
privately-held plantations and landholdings, sometimes armed with carving knifes
and scythes. 

Currently, MST receives help from the Brazilian government and donations from
international organizations. The movement also receives funds by selling
&lt;a href="http%3A//store.gxonlinestore.org/strongroots.html"&gt;videos of their invasions&lt;/a&gt;.

Overall, a recent report on labor standards in Brazil has shown that conditions
for laborers are poor

PARIS – The nineteen member nations of the &lt;a href="w%3AParis%20Club"&gt;Paris Club&lt;/a&gt; have agreed to forgive 80 percent of &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;'s debt, reports the &lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters news service&lt;/a&gt;. The plan will reduce Iraq's total debt to the member nations to $7.8 billion, from the original $38.9 billion, over a period of four years.

The three-phase plan approved by the creditors calls for an immediate cancellation of 30 percent of Iraq's current debt, which will be followed by another 30 percent in 2005 upon approval of an economic program for the nation by the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Monetary%20Fund"&gt;International Monetary Fund&lt;/a&gt; and 20 percent in 2008 after an evaluation of the effectiveness of the program.

&lt;a href="w%3AAdel%20Abdul%20Mahdi"&gt;Adel Abdul Mahdi&lt;/a&gt;, Iraq's Finance Minister, said that the deal was "historic". He also expressed optimism that other creditor nations, including neighbors in the Middle East as well as several Eastern European nations, may follow the West's lead in forgiving Iraqi debt.

However, &lt;a href="w%3ABulgaria"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARomania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; have announced that they intend to recoup as much as possible of the debt owed them by Iraq, claiming that the inflow of cash from Iraq is essential to their respective economies. They have, however, indicated their willingness to discuss rescheduling of payments on the debt. &lt;a href="w%3ADimitar%20Tsonev"&gt;Dimitar Tsonev&lt;/a&gt;, spokesman for the Bulgarian government, told the Sofia News Agency that the requests from Western leaders to reduce Iraq's debt were not the first such requests he had received. &lt;a href="w%3ARomania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; has said it would like to take a flexible approach to the debt repayments, one which is in line with its economic potential.

The plan is the culmination of a trans-Atlantic struggle over the amount of Iraqi debt to be forgiven, the United States pushing for a 90 to 95 percent reduction while France argued for much less.

The main discussion topics were the end of the embargo on the exportation of Brazilian meats, from animals such as bovines and pigs, to Russia and the interest of the Russian government in conquering the support of Brazil to enter the &lt;a href="World%20Trade%20Organization"&gt;World Trade Organization&lt;/a&gt;.

Lula said Brazil will support Russia to enter the World Trade Organization, but Russia did not agree with the end of the embargo of Brazilian meat. Russia has forbidden the entrance of Brazilian meat in their country because there was a suspection of Brazilian cattle contamination by aftosa fever. Brazilian authorities said there is no danger and the cattle's health has been monitored.
By another agreement Brazil will teach the Russians techniques of soccer and the Russians go to repass techniques of athletism and swimming.

Among the crowd were celebrity-actors &lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20Sheen"&gt;Martin Sheen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASusan%20Sarandon"&gt;Susan Sarandon&lt;/a&gt;; Sarandon narrated the 1997 documentary ♡❤School of Assassins♡❤ about the school's history.

In 1946 the military Latin American Training Center U.S. Ground Forces was established in Panama; in 1949 it became the U.S. Army Caribbean Training Center and during 1963 the training center expanded and became the U.S. Army School of the Americas (USARSA or SOA). The SOA mission was to counter the influence of &lt;a href="w%3ACommunism"&gt;Communism&lt;/a&gt; in the region, and to assist Latin-American nations in fighting armed Communist movements. In 1984 the school was moved to Fort Benning, near Columbus. At the end of 2000, the SOA was closed as its reason of existence as an anti-Communist school was rendered unnecessary. In 2001, the &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20Hemisphere%20Institute%20for%20Security%20Cooperation"&gt;Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation&lt;/a&gt; was opened in the same location. WHINSEC offers training to Latin American military and civilian forces in combat, counter-narcotics, and counter-insurgency techniques, with training completed mainly in the Spanish language.

Activists claim that both SOA (in the past, during 80's) and WHINSEC (at present day) trained militias in tactics of violence that are/were used against political dissidents in their native countries. They accuse SOA graduates of been responsible of death squads, drug deals, murders, rape and torture. They say the school is responsible by these acts and that many techniques of torture its graduated students have used in their countries had been learned at the military American school. A list of allegeds SOA graduated students's crimes can be seen at the Virtual Truth Commission, an anti-SOA webpage.

Pro-SOA say the school was important in the maintenance of the security in the Latin America and United States during &lt;a href="w%3ACold%20War"&gt;Cold War&lt;/a&gt;. A list of death victims by communist groups between 1935-1972 only in Brazil can be seen at the Ternuma (Terrorism never), a Brazilian alleged anti-terrorism webpage. Also, the US Department of Defense maintains a list of significant terrorist incidents between 1961-2003, among them are several crimes committed by communist groups. The UK version of IndyMedia distributes a copy in English of the Manual of the Urban Guerrilla which details techniques of urban terrorism for communism, written by Carlos Marighella, a communism fighter. The &lt;a href="Cuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;n dictator &lt;a href="w%3AFidel%20Castro"&gt;Fidel Castro&lt;/a&gt; advocated armed revolutionary struggle in Latin America. The &lt;a href="w%3AUSSR"&gt;USSR&lt;/a&gt; or Soviet Union gave trainning, military and economic help through Cuba to various communists groups in American continent. 

The protest at Fort Benning which involved a mock funeral procession is an annual event organized by the School of Americas Watch (SOAW) to commemorate the first assassination attributed to school's graduates, the November 16 1989, killing of six &lt;a href="w%3AEl%20Salvador"&gt;Salvadoran&lt;/a&gt; Jesuit priests, their housekeeper, and her teenage daughter, at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Central%20America"&gt;University of Central America&lt;/a&gt; (UCA). Of the 27 soldiers cited for that killing by a 1993 &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATruth%20Commission"&gt;Truth Commission&lt;/a&gt;, 19 were SOA graduates. SOAW lists 11 former Latin American dictators as graduates of the School. USA deny they supported dictators and they protest against Fidel Castro, the long-time dictator of Cuba, who has received support, military and economic help from USSR for a long time.

SOA officials say thousands of soldiers have been trained and about 300 of them have been accused of human rights violations. "The connections that critics make between the school and the crimes allegedly committed by its graduates are tenuous at best", says Joe Leuer - who worked at SOA.

Pro-military activists planned a concurrent gathering called "God Bless Fort Benning Celebration," to honor the soldiers and history of the military base where WHINSEC is located. "If they have 10,000, then we have 10,001," organizer Miriam Tidwell told Associated Press. Unverified reports of this counter-demonstration put attendance figures between 10,000 and 15,000.

WHINSEC operates with an annual budget of approximately &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;8 million, the school curriculum now includes a mandated 8 hours of training in human rights which includes "human rights, rule of law, due process, civilian control of the military, and the role of the military in a democratic society."

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADan%20Rather"&gt;Dan Rather&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has announced that he will retire on March 9th, 2005 as anchor of &lt;a href="CBS%20News"&gt;CBS&lt;/a&gt; Evening News. He will continue to be a correspondent for both of the &lt;a href="60%20Minutes"&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/a&gt; shows.

It is reported that Rather's leaving has nothing to do with a report in 2004 regarding US President Bush's National Guard service that was widely reported to be factually false. A CBS panel is looking into that report. 

Others believe that Rather is stepping down due to this report and investigation. Howard Kurtz, a reporter for the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20Post"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , states that "It's pretty clear that Dan Rather faced a very unpalatable choice... His contract had at least two more years to run. [Should he] step down now before the outside investigative report, commissioned by CBS News expected in the next few weeks about his botching -- and the network's botching -- of that story about President Bush's National Guard service? Rather [decided] today that it would be better for him to step down on his own terms."

Dan Rather, 74, has been the anchor for ♡❤CBS Evening News♡❤ for 24 years, succeeding &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWalter%20Cronkite"&gt;Walter Cronkite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Rather is the third most watched anchor on United States television.

Emails exchanged among &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Air%20Force"&gt;United States Air Force&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; officials regarding a USD$23 billion dollar deal with aircraft manufacturer &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABoeing"&gt;Boeing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have been entered into the public record. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASenator"&gt;Senator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Republican%20Party"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -&lt;a href="Arizona"&gt;AZ&lt;/a&gt;) entered them into the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACongressional%20Record"&gt;Congressional Record&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; during a speech last week against the now-cancelled deal to lease 100 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAerial%20refueling"&gt;mid-air tanker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; aircraft from Boeing.

Congressional lawmakers rejected the proposal in October, although industry experts say the deal had been killed by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APentagon"&gt;Pentagon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; because of reports stating that the deal had favored Boeing. Senator McCain has been the deal's most vocal critic.

The original negotiations with Boeing were over a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ano-bid%20contract"&gt;no-bid contract&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Such contracts are often justified by the speed they offer, eliminating a preliminary bid and selection round that may last months. However, no-bid contracts are only open to the company selected by the procuring agency. This leaves no-bid contracts open to accusations of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aconflict%20of%20interest"&gt;conflicts of interest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; among the procurement personnel. Such accusations have previously been leveled against Vice President &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADick%20Cheney"&gt;Dick Cheney&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for a no-bid contract to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHalliburton"&gt;Halliburton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and are now being made against senior Air Force officials for choosing Boeing to replace its tanker fleet.

In the released emails, Air Force officials responsible for the awarding of contracts appear biased against Boeing's main competitor, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAirbus"&gt;Airbus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and its &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChief%20executive%20officer"&gt;CEO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARalph%20Crosby"&gt;Ralph Crosby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAirbus"&gt;Airbus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is owned by European Aeronautic Defense &amp; Space Company (EADS). Airbus manufacturers a number of passenger and military aircraft and has gained market share in passenger aircraft over Boeing in recent years. The following is a sequential email exchange regarding Airbus as recorded in the ♡❤Congressional Record♡❤:

An email from Burkhardt &amp; Associates to James Roche advises the Secretary to release fiscal numbers favorable to Boeing, apparently regardless of the facts: "I'd distribute a one page memo saying the per plane cost of the lease will not be greater than x and have x be less than the last lease Boeing did for some commercial entity--or that x is y dollars less than the cost of a new tanker," it said. An additional email by Roche provides a stark contrast to his criticism of Airbus, as he talks to Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition Marvin Sambur about Boeing, saying, "I love Ya, Big Guy. Give it to the Blue Eyed Arabs of the North (the expression we used for Boeing)."

&lt;a href="http%3A//www.govexec.com/dailyfed/0504/051304cdpm2.htm"&gt;GovExec.com&lt;/a&gt; quotes a "Senate aide" as saying: "The House language [of the spending bill] ignores an analysis of alternatives called for in last year's authorizing language and by Pentagon Acquisition Director Michael Wynne and the DSB. It precludes such an analysis and predetermines the outcome in favor of the Boeing 767 before the study is even initiated." The activist organization the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.pogo.org/p/contracts/ca-020509-bailout.html"&gt;Project on Government Oversight&lt;/a&gt; has called it "a textbook case of favoritism to a single defense contractor."

Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition Marvin Sambur defended the Air Force's exclusive consideration of Boeing, saying, "This was not a competitive bid process. The Air Force was ordered by Congress to work with Boeing on the new tanker program."

Boeing had previously hired Civilian Deputy Undersecretary of the Air Force for Acquisition &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADarleen%20Druyun"&gt;Darleen Druyun&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . This caused a controversy over conflict of interest and led to felony charges against Boeing Chief Financial Officer Michael Sears for illegally hiring her. Former military personnel are often hired by defense contractors to lobby for contracts.

Days after Sen. McCain's remarks, the Air Force said the tanker replacement contract would be revived as an &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aopen%20bid"&gt;open bid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Deputy Defense Secretary &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Wolfowitz"&gt;Wolfowitz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; published an open-article in the ♡❤Congressional Record♡❤, saying: "After we have selected an appropriate alternative, we intend to require competition."

<h2>Background</h2>
In &lt;a href="Ukraine"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;, a dead heat in the October 31 election between current Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AViktor%20Yanukovych"&gt;Viktor Yanukovych&lt;/a&gt; and former Prime Minister &lt;a href="Viktor%20Yushchenko"&gt;Viktor Yushchenko&lt;/a&gt; resulted in a runoff election on November 21. The runoff was plagued with allegations of large-scale voter fraud, particularly in the oblasts (regions) of &lt;a href="w%3ADonetsk%20Oblast"&gt;Donetsk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALuhansk"&gt;Luhansk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AKharkiv"&gt;Kharkiv&lt;/a&gt; in eastern Ukraine where Yanukovych had the strongest support. Election observers from the &lt;a href="w%3AOrganization%20for%20Security%20and%20Cooperation%20in%20Europe"&gt;Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)&lt;/a&gt; state that the election did not meet international standards and was subject to wide-scale, planned election fraud. On the other hand, some groups of international observers such as &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Helsinki%20Human%20Rights%20Group"&gt;British Helsinki Human Rights Group&lt;/a&gt; give a quite different picture of massive violations in Western Ukraine, and pro-opposition bias of local media there: &lt;a href="http%3A//www.bhhrg.org/CountryReport.asp%3FCountryID%3D22%26amp%3BReportID%3D230"&gt;BHHRG Report&lt;/a&gt;(The report is discredited in this &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Guardian"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http%3A//www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0%2C%2C1362333%2C00.html"&gt;article &lt;/a&gt; ).

The declaration of Yanukovych as the winner of the runoff by the elections commission set into play mass demonstrations and demands for a recount or outright revote from Yuschchenko supporters. The result has been widely criticised by Western media as fraudulent.

&lt;a href="w%3AAdelaide"&gt;ADELAIDE&lt;/a&gt; – At stumps on day one, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; has opened a commanding lead in the second cricket test against &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;.

The laughter started soon after Australian captain &lt;a href="w%3ARicky%20Ponting"&gt;Ricky Ponting&lt;/a&gt; won the toss and elected to bat on the hard, dry pitch. Openers &lt;a href="w%3AJustin%20Langer"&gt;Justin Langer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMatthew%20Hayden"&gt;Matthew Hayden&lt;/a&gt; got off to a flying start, achieving 0/19 off the first two overs. Hayden was later &lt;a href="w%3Acaught"&gt;caught&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Abowled"&gt;bowled&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Wiseman"&gt;Paul Wiseman&lt;/a&gt; for 70. Although Hayden was clearly out, he refused to walk, insisting after the incident with &lt;a href="w%3ACraig%20McMillan"&gt;Craig McMillan&lt;/a&gt; in the previous test, that the field umpires called for the video replay, which quickly ruled that he was out. 

Ponting then came out to replace Hayden, and quickly took a fancy to the New Zealand bowlers. He eventually misjudged a spin delivery from &lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Vettori"&gt;Daniel Vettori&lt;/a&gt; and was stumped for 68. &lt;a href="w%3ADamien%20Martyn"&gt;Damien Martyn&lt;/a&gt; briefly stepped in, but was cheaply dismissed for 7, only to be replaced by &lt;a href="w%3ADarren%20Lehmann"&gt;Darren Lehmann&lt;/a&gt;, who is not out on 28.

The best performance of the innings though, came from Justin Langer, who is currently not out on 144. Australia, at the time of writing, are 3/327, putting themselves into a commanding position for the second day's play. 

Australia has already won the series with their previous victory in &lt;a href="w%3ABrisbane"&gt;Brisbane&lt;/a&gt;, and this test is widely regarded merely as batting practice for &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Fleming"&gt;Stephen Fleming&lt;/a&gt;'s New Zealand side. Key bowler &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Franklin%20%28cricketer%29"&gt;James Franklin&lt;/a&gt; is returning from injury in this game, but has had a poor start, with figures of 0/84 off of 14 overs.

&lt;a href="w%3AChenjiashan"&gt;CHENJIASHAN, China&lt;/a&gt; – Around 170 workers were trapped in the &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AChenjiashan"&gt;Chenjiashan&lt;/a&gt; mine, early Sunday morning, November 28th, the BBC reports.

Chinese state officials said that 123 workers managed to escape the facilities. Many of those who escaped the mines are suffering from &lt;a href="w%3Acarbon%20monoxide"&gt;carbon monoxide&lt;/a&gt; poisoning. Since the accident, there has been no contact with the 170 workers trapped inside, although the initial number of 183 people still in the complex was revised downwards.

China has had a long history of mining accidents &amp;mdash;its mines are known as being among the most dangerous in the world. Last month, more than 150 people died after a gas explosion in a mine in the &lt;a href="w%3AHenan"&gt;Henan&lt;/a&gt; province. The official tally of 4,153 mine fatalities during the first nine months of this year is actually a 13% improvement over the same period last year, which had a total of 6,246 mine worker deaths &amp;mdash;4,620 of them coal mines. 5,203 deaths occurred among workers in other China industries.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Ruling%20party%20ahead%20in%20Romanian%20elections&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

BUCHAREST, Romania – &lt;a href="w%3ARomania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;'s ruling &lt;a href="w%3ASocial%20Democratic%20Party%20%28Romania%29"&gt;Social Democrat Party&lt;/a&gt; (PSD) has emerged ahead in yesterday's legislative and presidential elections. The voter turnout was around 57% of all eligible voters, which number 18 million people in a country of 21.7 million.

However the PSD did not gain the vote majority needed to declare an outright victory, and it will now proceed to a run-off election against the centre-left opposition. Called the Truth and Justice Alliance, the main opposition is a union of candidates from the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Liberal%20Party%20%28Romania%29"&gt;National Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28Romania%29"&gt;Democrat Party&lt;/a&gt;. 

While PSD+PUR is currently leading, the most hotly-contested election in Romania's post-Communist history may come down to the run-off, to be held on December 12. The winning presidential candidate of the run-off will not only become the country's president but will also appoint a prime minister to lead the government.

In the presidential election, &lt;a href="w%3AAdrian%20N%C4%83stase"&gt;Adrian Năstase&lt;/a&gt;, the PSD's presidential candidate, won approximately 42% of the vote, while &lt;a href="w%3ATraian%20B%C4%83sescu"&gt;Traian Băsescu&lt;/a&gt; of Truth and Justice obtained around 35%, according to exit polls. 

Năstase led the exit polls due to greater support in rural Romania, as well as support from the urban poor, due to his policy of boosting the economy. Năstase's PSD+PUR coalition was also supported because they are credited with saving Romania from economic collapse during their presidential and legislative term from 2000 until the present time. During his term of prime-minister of Romania, from 2000 to 2004, Năstase not only boosted the economy but ensured that Romania entered &lt;a href="w%3ANATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; and progressed towards its accession to the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;, expected to occur in 2007. In 2004, the economy is expected to grow by 8.6%, the highest rate in &lt;a href="w%3AEurope"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;.

Băsescu won a majority in &lt;a href="w%3ABucharest"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt;, Romania's capital, as well as in the wealthier cities of &lt;a href="w%3ATransylvania"&gt;Transylvania&lt;/a&gt;. Băsescu is supported by the educated middle-class, who take a favourable view upon his policy of stamping out corruption in one of the region's most corrupt countries. Băsescu has also received a boost due to his liberalist policies and his proposal for tax reform and the introduction of a flat tax.

In the legislative election, the PSD+PUR coalition obtained 40% of the vote, while the Truth and Justice alliance trailed with 35%. Because the PSD+PUR coalition did not gather the majority of the votes (50%+1), it will have to form a governing coalition with the minor parties, a process which is expected to be tedious given the fact that both of the major parties have ruled out entering into a coalition with ultra-nationalist &lt;a href="w%3AGreat%20Romania%20Party"&gt;The Greater Romania Party&lt;/a&gt;, which obtained around 12% of the vote.

<h1>Researchers discover high temperature enables more efficient hydrogen generation</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Researchers%20discover%20high%20temperature%20enables%20more%20efficient%20hydrogen%20generation&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A more efficient way to produce useable &lt;a href="w%3Ahydrogen"&gt;hydrogen&lt;/a&gt; has been demonstrated by researchers. It uses very high-temperature &lt;a href="w%3Aelectrolysis"&gt;electrolysis&lt;/a&gt; to separate hydrogen from water, so that hydrogen may be used for &lt;a href="w%3Aenergy"&gt;energy&lt;/a&gt; production.

Electrolysis is one method by which laboratories and factories produce hydrogen. An electrical current is passed through water, breaking it down into hydrogen and oxygen gas, which are then collected above the water reservoir.

Researchers in &lt;a href="w%3ASalt%20Lake%20City%2C%20Utah"&gt;Salt Lake City, Utah&lt;/a&gt;, at ♡❤Ceramtech Incorporated♡❤, in collaboration with workers at ♡❤The Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory♡❤ report that when water is superheated to 800 degrees Celsius, far less electricity is required to produce the same volume of hydrogen. The researchers envision that future nuclear fission plants could be used both to heat the water as part of their cooling system, and generate the needed electricity.

Concerns have been raised regarding the safety of such arrangements, however. Jeremy Desterhoft, an independent consultant on nuclear energy safety, warns the "elevated levels of radiation required to sufficiently lower the atomic separation point is beyond the current capabilities of any recent cooler." He does not believe that economically viable cooling technology will be available for at least four to six more years.

CRAIG, Alaska – 
♡❤♡Rachelle Waterman♡❤♡, (aka Rachelle Ann Monica Waterman and "smchyrocky"), a 16-year-old girl from &lt;a href="w%3ACraig%2C%20Alaska"&gt;Craig, Alaska&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt;, has been charged with the first degree murder of her mother.

The case has rapidly received a wide following on the &lt;a href="w%3AInternet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt;, partly because Waterman kept a public record of her thoughts and activities on &lt;a href="w%3ALiveJournal"&gt;LiveJournal&lt;/a&gt;, a popular &lt;a href="w%3Aweblog"&gt;blogging service&lt;/a&gt;. The last entry, which has since been removed from public view, was posted on &lt;a href="w%3ANovember%2018"&gt;November 18&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3A2004"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt; and read:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;Just to let everyone know, my mother was murdered.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;♡❤I won't have computer acess ♡❤[sic] ♡❤until the weekend or so because the police took my computer to go through the &lt;a href="hard%20drive"&gt;hard drive&lt;/a&gt;. I thank everyone for their thoughts and e-mails, I hope to talk to you when I get my computer back.♡❤&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A diverse group of users, both friends and strangers, have posted over 5,000 comments on the journal, positive and negative, transforming the case into an Internet phenomenon. Every entry since March 2004 has apparently now been deleted or hidden, but a &lt;a href="w%3AZIP%20file%20format"&gt;ZIP archive&lt;/a&gt; of the entire weblog, from before the entries were deleted, is available on &lt;a href="http%3A//elliottback.com/wp/archives/2004/11/29/deadly-blogging/"&gt;Deadly Blogging&lt;/a&gt;.

Waterman was a tenth-grade honor (A-average) student in her second year at Craig High School. She was also a member of the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.usad.org"&gt;Academic Decathlon&lt;/a&gt; team (ACDC) and sang in the &lt;a href="w%3Achoir"&gt;choir&lt;/a&gt;, a profile that has left many people questioning her involvement in the killing and asking what motive there might be. At the time police say the killing occurred, Rachelle Waterman was apparently playing in a volleyball tournament in &lt;a href="w%3AAnchorage"&gt;Anchorage&lt;/a&gt;, Alaska.

Apart from the online diary Rachelle kept, the case is also unusual because &lt;a href="w%3Amatricide"&gt;matricide&lt;/a&gt; committed by female minors is extremely rare.

<h2>Family background</h2>
The Waterman family is a locally prominent, middle-upper class family. Born on &lt;a href="w%3AAugust%2026"&gt;August 26&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3A1988"&gt;1988&lt;/a&gt;, Rachelle showed an interest in acting, computers, movies and music, and was an honor roll student, involved in many extra-curricular activities, including &lt;a href="w%3Achoir"&gt;choir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Avolleyball"&gt;volleyball&lt;/a&gt;, and the decathlon team - advancing to upper levels and winning prizes in almost every endeavor. Her mother, Lauri, was a &lt;a href="w%3Ateacher"&gt;teachers'&lt;/a&gt; aide and served on the board of the Little League and the town &lt;a href="w%3Alibrary"&gt;library&lt;/a&gt;. Rachelle Waterman's 60-year-old father, Carl "Doc" Waterman, is a &lt;a href="w%3Areal%20estate%20agent"&gt;real estate agent&lt;/a&gt; and serves as president of the Craig School Board. Rachelle's older brother, Geoffrey, lives out of town and is a student at Tacoma College.

<h2>The case</h2>
Waterman and her alleged accomplices, &lt;a href="w%3AJason%20Arrant"&gt;Jason Arrant&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABrian%20Radel"&gt;Brian Radel&lt;/a&gt;, both 24 years old, are accused of murdering and conspiring to murder Waterman's 48-year-old mother, Lauri Waterman.

Reportedly, Arrant dropped Radel off near the Waterman home shortly after 12:00 a.m. Sunday, November 13, 2004 (local time) where Radel proceeded to kidnap Lauri Waterman, force her into a minivan owned by the Waterman family, and kill her with a blunt object.

Arrant and Radel then allegedly met at Forest Service Road 3012 at about 2:30 a.m., and Arrant followed Radel to its dead end, where Radel had driven the Waterman's van.

Arrant then allegedly watched as Radel doused the body and van with gasoline and then used a roll of paper towels to set it on fire, in an attempt to destroy the &lt;a href="w%3Aevidence"&gt;evidence.&lt;/a&gt;

<h3>Police investigation</h3>
Alaska State Police Lt. ♡❤♡Rodney Dial♡❤♡ has stated that a &lt;a href="w%3Ahunting"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt; discovered Lauri Waterman's body and her burnt-out van, while driving on Forest Service Road 3012, a remote logging road, early in the afternoon of Sunday &lt;a href="w%3ANovember%2014"&gt;November 14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2004"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;.

On Saturday, &lt;a href="w%3ANovember%2020"&gt;November 20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2004"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;, Alaska State Police Trooper ♡❤♡Robert Claus♡❤♡ stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;During ... interviews all three made admissions as to their involvement in the murder. Physical evidence recovered at the various crime scenes corroborated many of the &lt;a href="defendant"&gt;defendant&lt;/a&gt;s' statements ... Radel, Arrant and Waterman have been charged with murder in the first degree. Due to the severity of the charges, Waterman has been waived into adult &lt;a href="court"&gt;court&lt;/a&gt;. Additional charges of &lt;a href="w%3Asolicitation"&gt;solicitation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Aconspiracy"&gt;conspiracy&lt;/a&gt;, tampering with physical evidence and other charges are pending. Arrant and Waterman will be &lt;a href="w%3Aarraignment"&gt;arraigned&lt;/a&gt; in the District Court in Craig this morning.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<h3>Arraignment</h3>

On Saturday, November 20, 2004, Rachelle appeared in Craig District Court, dressed in an orange CCJF jumpsuit, for &lt;a href="w%3Aarraignment"&gt;arraignment&lt;/a&gt; on the charges. Waterman and her alleged co-conspirators, Jason Arrant, and Brian Radel, faced a 10-count &lt;a href="w%3Aindictment"&gt;indictment&lt;/a&gt;, listing 26 &lt;a href="w%3Afelony"&gt;felonies&lt;/a&gt;.

The Fairbanks Daily News-Miner reported that, "the complaint against Rachelle Waterman relied on statements by all three co-defendants. The complaint says the girl told one of the &lt;a href="w%3Asuspect"&gt;suspects&lt;/a&gt; when she and her father would be out of town."

A report in The Ketchikan Daily News stated that, "The first seven counts of the indictment allege that all three defendants committed the crimes of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder; first-degree murder; second-degree murder; &lt;a href="w%3Akidnapping"&gt;kidnapping&lt;/a&gt;; first-degree &lt;a href="w%3Aburglary"&gt;burglary&lt;/a&gt;; first-degree vehicle &lt;a href="w%3Atheft"&gt;theft&lt;/a&gt; and tampering with physical evidence." Other charges were made against Arrant and Radel. The same report went on to state, "Trooper Robert Claus, Klawock resident Jan Bush and Deputy State Medical Examiner Susan Klingler testified before the grand jury."

Magistrate Kay Clark presided over the arraignment and set &lt;a href="w%3Abail"&gt;bail&lt;/a&gt; at $150,000. Clark also appointed a &lt;a href="w%3Apublic%20defender"&gt;public defender&lt;/a&gt; to represent Rachelle, who was sent to the &lt;a href="w%3AJuneau%2C%20Alaska"&gt;Juneau&lt;/a&gt; Department of Corrections facility.

<h3>The trial</h3>
Judge Patricia Collins, of the Juneau Superior Court, has been assigned to run the trial for the case. Judge Collins originally set a date of February 3, 2005 for the trial, but, at an arraignment that week, the trial was rescheduled for August 22. According to court officials, another postponement is likely.

Rachelle Waterman's court-appointed attorney for the trial is Assistant Public Advocate Steven Wells. Assistant District Attorney Daniel Schally is assigned to prosecute the case.

<h2>Alleged motive</h2>
No &lt;a href="w%3Amotive"&gt;motive&lt;/a&gt; for the crime has been suggested. Readers are closely scrutinizing Rachelle's online journal for clues.

As early as February 24th of 2004, she posted the following:

Numerous readers have pointed to Rachelle's negative comments concerning her mother's wishes to send her to a "fat farm" to lose weight.

In another incident, her mother grounded her (restricted her to home) for receiving an 89% score on a test. Rachelle posted these comments to her journal in response to this situation (verbatim spelling):

Other readers have pointed to the title of Rachelle's journal, "My Crappy Life (The Inside Look of an Insane Person)", and her negative description of her hometown as "Hell, Alaska, United States":

Rachelle posted the following poem to her journal on &lt;a href="w%3AAugust%2024"&gt;August 24&lt;/a&gt;, 2004, with an indication that she was depressed:

She also had a strong desire not to be at home:

and even posted an "Ode to &lt;a href="w%3ASuicide"&gt;Suicide&lt;/a&gt;" under the following post:

Finally, the weekend before Rachelle left on a trip, during which time her mother was allegedly killed, she noted in her second-to-last entry, "I had a &lt;a href="w%3Amigraine"&gt;migraine&lt;/a&gt; from about 9am-6pm".

<h2>Incarceration</h2>
Rachelle Waterman is currently incarcerated at the Lemon Creek correctional facility, in Alaska. She signed an agreement to be placed into the general population. Corrections Deputy Commissioner Portia Parker indicated that Waterman "is an adult in the eyes of the law."

Alaska law places persons charged with first-degree murder at the age of 16 or older in the adult court system, and most of the records concerning this case are open to the public for inspection.

<h2>Aftermath</h2>
One of the last entries in Rachelle's journal wonders whether anyone is reading her comments (verbatim spelling):

Although Waterman has not yet been convicted, &lt;a href="w%3Asociology"&gt;sociologists&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aforensic%20psychology"&gt;forensic psychologists&lt;/a&gt; are beginning to study her journal and the circumstances of her writing it. (The police have seized her computer and are examining the contents of its &lt;a href="hard%20drive"&gt;hard drive&lt;/a&gt; for evidence.)

LiveJournal has subsequently restricted the viewing of her journal.

When interviewed by Alaskan television station KTUU about the nature of online journals, (in late November, 2004) forensic psychologist Susan LaGrande commented that "[i]t's such an anonymous vehicle that you can be whoever or say whatever you want. You don't have all the responsibilities that are inherent in a face-to-face real, legitimate relationship.

This same report pointed out that Rachelle Waterman had mentioned suicide in her online journal.

<h3>Juvenile crime</h3>
Criminologist Susan Magestro was interviewed by KTUU on the subject of juvenile crime, in late November, 2004, after Waterman became the second teenager within two months to be accused of murdering her own parent. She stated that "I think that we're starting to see more violence with kids who are younger, and the behaviors that they're exhibiting are more aggressive and more violent." Magestro also opined that "we've got a lot more fetal alcohol and drug children who are growing up, and they don't understand the consequences of some of their actions." (There is no indication that Waterman was a so-called "fetal alcohol" or "drug" child.)

KTUU reported that Magestro "...blames violent movies, TV shows and videogames for desensitizing young people, making them unable to understand the consequences -- or even the reality -- of their actions." 

Although Waterman has been waived into the adult justice system due to the nature of the crime, the Governor of Alaska, Frank Murkowski, has proposed increasing the number of personnel assigned to the juvenile justice system.

CAWKER CITY, KANSAS – 
People in Kansas like to just go have a look at things from time to time, particularly if it is kitchy and big. Frank Stoeber died in 1974, but not before he left behind a legacy of twine. Frank started a building a ball of sisal twine (a form of hemp) in 1953, which as grown to 40 ft in diameter hence. The ball of twine's domicile is a mini-museam located in the downtown of Cawker City, Kansas, which onlookers can simple look at or add twine to. In some ways Frank's ball of twine mirrors that of the failed culture of Easter Island. On Easter Island, the people built large stone heads in some final attempt to perserve a culture that was dying from lack of trees. Similarly, Frank's large ball of twine stands an object of preservation. In case you don't make off the coast of Chili, head out to the heartland and have a look.

HANOVER, Germany – 
Internet portal and mail-provider &lt;a href="w%3ALycos"&gt;Lycos Europe&lt;/a&gt; has launched a program to increase spammers' bills by having thousands of voluntary users' computers repeatedly query websites from which spam originates. Such a tactic would increase the &lt;a href="w%3Abandwidth"&gt;bandwidth&lt;/a&gt; costs for these websites. However, it also faces legal questions.

&lt;a href="w%3ASpamming"&gt;Spamming&lt;/a&gt;, the mass sending of unsolicited emails, is lucrative in part because each email can be sent for nearly insignificant costs. With such low costs, a commercial spammer needs only to have a very small number of recipients buy their product to make a profit. The goal of many anti-spam proposals has been to increase the cost of spammers sending messages. Lycos' approach is to make it more expensive to maintain servers that send spam.

Volunteers may download the screensaver from the &lt;a href="http%3A//makelovenotspam.com/intl/index.html"&gt;Lycos website for it&lt;/a&gt;. The program would run on a user's computer in the background and request about three &lt;a href="w%3AMegabyte"&gt;megabytes&lt;/a&gt; (3MBs) of data every day. The screensaver shows which spam server is being targeted by the user, where the server is located, and how many others are attacking it at that moment. Target email servers are selected from &lt;a href="w%3Ablacklist"&gt;blacklists&lt;/a&gt; from anti-spam organizations, with Lycos' own verification.

Legal issues arise over whether this can be interpreted as a &lt;a href="w%3Adenial%20of%20service%20attack"&gt;denial of service attack&lt;/a&gt;. In such an attack, computers overwhelm a webserver with requests for data to the point where it does not have the resources to fulfill its normal function. Lycos, in explanatory material on the screensaver's dedicated website ( http://makelovenotspam.com ), claims that its technology closely monitors the screensavers' effects on targeted websites and prevents any of them from being completely shut down by information requests. 

Lycos Europe operates in &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; where, according to Joerg Heidrich of &lt;a href="w%3AHeise%20Zeitschriften%20Verlag"&gt;Heise Zeitschriften Verlag&lt;/a&gt;, less than completely shutting down a server is not clearly illegal under the penal code. It may, however, be actionable under the civil code. But Lycos may be betting that no one will file a suit, as that would require those participating in illegal spamming to reveal their identity.

The website no longer allows downloads of the screensaver, and users of the screensaver cannot connect to spam sites, but are instead given the message 'Stay Tuned'

SANTIAGO, Chile – 
The ♡❤♡Valech Report♡❤♡, officially titled ♡❤♡The National Commission on Political Imprisonment and Torture Report♡❤♡, was made public yesterday (&lt;a href="w%3ANovember%2029"&gt;November 29&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3A2004"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;) by Bishop Sergio Valech, the head of the eight-member panel commission into abuses committed in &lt;a href="w%3AChile"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href="w%3A1973"&gt;1973&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3A1990"&gt;1990&lt;/a&gt; by agents of &lt;a href="w%3AAugusto%20Pinochet"&gt;Augusto Pinochet&lt;/a&gt;'s military regime. It was prepared by the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Commission%20on%20Political%20Imprisonment%20and%20Torture"&gt;National Commission on Political Imprisonment and Torture&lt;/a&gt; at the request of the president, and it is freely available to the public as a document on the &lt;a href="w%3AInternet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt;.

The report was based on testimonies given to the commission by more than 35,000 people. A little over 27,000 of those testimonies were regarded as legitimate by the commission.

On addressing the nation on &lt;a href="w%3ANovember%2028"&gt;November 28&lt;/a&gt;, 2004, president &lt;a href="w%3ARicardo%20Lagos"&gt;Ricardo Lagos&lt;/a&gt; said he would propose a bill that will provide compensation to the victims.

Most witnesses described behavioral, emotional and psychosocial effects. Many said they had felt — and still feel — insecure and fearful, humiliated, ashamed and guilty; depressed, anxiety-ridden and hopeless. Some persons mentioned alterations in their concentration and memory; others cited conflicts, crises and breakups within their families, as well as conjugal problems. They also mentioned the loss of reference groups and social networks. Most victims mentioned sleep disturbances and chronic insomnia, as well as behavioral inhibitions, phobias and fears.

This Commission heard testimony from 3,399 women, almost all of whom said they were the object of sexual violence; 316 said they were raped. Of the latter, 229 were detained while pregnant. Because of the torture they suffered, 20 of them aborted and 15 gave birth while in prison. Thirteen women said they were made pregnant by their captors; six of those pregnancies came to term.

&lt;a href="w%3AGusenbauer"&gt;Alfred Gusenbauer&lt;/a&gt; has been reelected as leader of the &lt;a href="Austria"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt;n Social Democrat Party (&lt;a href="w%3ASP"&gt;SPOE&lt;/a&gt;) at the party's convention in &lt;a href="w%3AVienna"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt;. Gusenbauer received 88.93% of the vote, an unexpectedly low value. In 2002, he was reelected with 99.6%. Gusenbauer leads the SPOE since 1999.

Albeit the low result he has called the vote an ♡❤"impressive display of confidence"♡❤. Gusenbauer and other heads of the party, including influential Vienna mayor Michael Haeupl have confirmed that Gusenbauer will be the party's top candidate for the next parliamental election which will also determine the Austrian chancellor.

In his keynote address Gusenbauer has issued heavy criticism at the current Austrian government which is led by chancellor &lt;a href="w%3AWolfgang%20Schssel"&gt;Wolfgang Schuessel&lt;/a&gt; and the Austrian People's Party (&lt;a href="w%3AVP"&gt;OEVP&lt;/a&gt;).

ASEAN members include &lt;a href="w%3AMyanmar"&gt;Myanmar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALaos"&gt;Laos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACambodia"&gt;Cambodia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AVietnam"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APhilippines"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMalaysia"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABrunei%20Darussalam"&gt;Brunei Darussalam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASingapore"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;.

In the last four years China has become a major importer of oil and commodities, and a major exporter of finished goods. China has also strengthened relationships with oil suppliers in the Middle East and Africa. This pact lifts trade restrictions and removes &lt;a href="w%3Atariffs"&gt;tariffs&lt;/a&gt; from many &lt;a href="w%3Aimports"&gt;imports&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aexports"&gt;exports&lt;/a&gt;. It also allows China to continue manipulating the value of its currency in its own interests. The &lt;a href="w%3ARenminbi"&gt;yuan&lt;/a&gt; is currently undervalued, making Chinese-made goods artificially cheap for foreign importers. 

Stated in the agreement is ASEAN's intention to create a unified economy--and by implication polity--similar to the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;EU&lt;/a&gt;. This agreement will cement China's role as the center of the South Asian regional economy, and at the same time strengthening bonds between China and other countries in the region and ease their suspicions over a growing superpower.

Japanese Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJunichiro%20Koizumi"&gt;Junichiro Koizumi&lt;/a&gt; and South Korean President &lt;a href="w%3ARoh%20Moo-Hyun"&gt;Roh Moo-Hyun&lt;/a&gt; separately adopted accords with the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations, agreeing to launch the talks early next year. Both agreements aim for trade pacts within two years. Australia and New Zealand are expected to sign similar agreements with ASEAN before discussions close later Tuesday, although ASEAN remains wary of Australian Prime Minister John Howard's refusal to sign its nonaggression treaty. Howard played down these concerns but said on record that he reserves the right to preemptively act against terrorists on foreign soil if they threaten Australia.

&lt;a href="w%3ABelfast"&gt;BELFAST&lt;/a&gt; – Hopes were rising that the impasse in the &lt;a href="w%3AGood%20Friday%20Agreement"&gt;Good Friday Agreement&lt;/a&gt; could be broken with high level talks in Downing Street between the British Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; and the Democratic Unionist leader &lt;a href="w%3A%20Ian%20Paisley"&gt;Ian Paisley&lt;/a&gt;.

It is also expected that the Republican &lt;a href="w%3ASinn%20Fein"&gt;Sinn Fein&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href="w%3AGerry%20Adams"&gt;Gerry Adams&lt;/a&gt; would have separate meetings with the Irish leader &lt;a href="w%3ABertie%20Ahern"&gt;Bertie Ahern&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3A%20Dublin"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt;.
These meetings follow a historic meeting between Gerry Adams and Northern Ireland Chief Constable Hugh Orde over issues of police reform and decommissioning.

The current impasse concerns the key issues of decommissioning of paramilitary weapons and the 'de-militarisation' of the province. Previous efforts to achieve a compromise failed because Unionists claimed insufficiently large amounts of &lt;a href="w%3AIRA"&gt;IRA&lt;/a&gt; weaponry had been decommissioned, and that there was insufficient evidence that the weapons had in fact been destroyed.

Some Unionists are insisting on photographic evidence of the destruction of IRA weapons, a request that is bound to be resisted by more militant Republicans. Even if further decommissioning occurs, Republicans are almost certain to want a specific timetable for the removal of British Army bases in Republican leaning areas of Northern Ireland (such as &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Armagh"&gt;South Armagh&lt;/a&gt;), which are much resented by some local inhabitants.

If the current deadlock were broken, it would mean the reconvening of the &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Ireland%20Assembly"&gt;Northern Ireland Assembly&lt;/a&gt;, which was shut down in 2002 amidst accusations of spying by both Republicans and Unionists.

United States President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; made his first official &lt;a href="w%3Astate%20visit"&gt;state visit&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; this week.

After the political frost between the two states surrounding the U.S.' War on Terror policy and its invasion of Iraq in 2003, the kind of relationship the neighbor states can build or rebuild is thought to be of concern to many Canadians &amp;mdash; the majority of whom remain highly critical of the Bush administration's policies.

Topics discussed included the U.S. &lt;a href="w%3AStrategic%20Defense%20Initiative"&gt;"Star Wars"&lt;/a&gt; missile defence system, the future of &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20American%20Aerospace%20Defense%20Command"&gt;NORAD&lt;/a&gt; (North American Aerospace Defence Command), combatting of &lt;a href="w%3AAIDS"&gt;AIDS&lt;/a&gt; and other diseases in Africa, and cracking down on illegal activities on the U.S.-Canada border. They also discussed trade issues including beef, lumber, and prescription drugs. 

&lt;a href="http%3A//www.pgablocottawa.net/"&gt;Protesters&lt;/a&gt; clashed with &lt;a href="w%3Ariot%20control"&gt;riot police&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AOttawa"&gt;Ottawa&lt;/a&gt; briefly on Tuesday in a break from what has been for the most part a calm series of demonstrations. The &lt;a href="http%3A//docs.indymedia.org/view/Global/FrequentlyAskedQuestionEn"&gt;Indymedia&lt;/a&gt; group of websites reported a &lt;a href="http%3A//www.ottawa.indymedia.org/en/2004/11/33.shtml"&gt;demonstration&lt;/a&gt; on the 29th against the deportation of Palestinian refugees.
They also report &lt;a href="http%3A//ottawa.indymedia.ca/en/2004/11/84.shtml"&gt;15,000&lt;/a&gt; people marched against Bush in Ottawa on the 30th and have &lt;a href="http%3A//maritimes.buffaloimc.org%3A8080/"&gt;text &lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http%3A//ottawa.indymedia.ca/en/2004/12/201.shtml"&gt;photos,&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="http%3A//ottawa.indymedia.org/media/2004/11/190.mov"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; of the protests. 

During an early afternoon news conference with Prime Minister &lt;a href="Paul%20Martin"&gt;Paul Martin&lt;/a&gt;, Bush said he was pleased with the welcome he received Tuesday morning. "I want to thank the Canadian people who came out to wave &amp;mdash;with all five fingers &amp;mdash;for their hospitality," he said with a chuckle.

The official 26-hour visit will take the American President to Canada's capital city, &lt;a href="w%3AOttawa"&gt;Ottawa&lt;/a&gt; and to &lt;a href="w%3AHalifax%20Regional%20Municipality%2C%20Nova%20Scotia"&gt;Halifax&lt;/a&gt;, where he will pay tribute to the hospitality shown by Canadians on &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%2C%202001%20attacks"&gt;September 11, 2001&lt;/a&gt;, when, after the U.S. closed its airspace, more than 200 flights were diverted to Canadian airports. Thousands of Americans were sheltered in Halifax (the largest city in Canada's Atlantic provinces) as well as St. John's and Gander in Newfoundland, and other centres.

WASHINGTON, D.C. – In a resignation statement today, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Homeland%20Security"&gt;United States Secretary of Homeland Security&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Ridge"&gt;Tom Ridge&lt;/a&gt; announced that he will leave his position by February 1, 2005, unless a successor is named sooner.

In his tenure as the first United States Secretary of Homeland Security, Ridge has been instrumental in establishing protocols aimed at thwarting terrorism, including a national warning system based on color coding that is routinely publicized nationally.

In his resignation, Ridge thanked &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; for the opportunity to help secure the nation and expressed his sentiments that the new security systems put in place since the &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%2C%202001%20attacks"&gt;September 11, 2001 attacks&lt;/a&gt; had made America safer and more prepared than it had been. He cited family and personal issues as major reasons for his resignation stating that, "After more than 22 consecutive years of public service, it is time to give personal and family matters a higher priority."

Several days after Ridge's announcement, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Health%20and%20Human%20Services"&gt;Secretary of Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATommy%20Thompson"&gt;Tommy Thompson&lt;/a&gt; announced his departure and warned that the nation remains vulnerable to potential food-borne terrorist attacks, stating, "I cannot understand why the terrorists have not attacked our food supply because it is so easy to do."

<h2>Legacy</h2>
As the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;'s first Secretary of Homeland Security, Ridge resigned his position as Governor of Pennsylvania in 2001 to take the position for which President Bush had nominated him.

He is well-known to Americans for implementing the now-famous &lt;a href="w%3AHomeland%20Security%20Advisory%20System"&gt;color-coded terror alert levels and advisories&lt;/a&gt; against various sorts of terrorism. 

The Department of Homeland Security is a new player in the power struggle in &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;. Throughout his tenure, Ridge fought a losing battle with the &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; for jurisdiction because the Bush administration allowed the FBI to remain a part of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice"&gt;Department of Justice&lt;/a&gt;.

WASHINGTON, D.C. – A &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense"&gt;U.S. Department of Defense&lt;/a&gt;
advisory committee has released &lt;a href="http%3A//www.acq.osd.mil/dsb/reports/2004-09-Strategic_Communication.pdf"&gt;a report&lt;/a&gt; harshly criticizing the U.S.-led "&lt;a href="War%0Aon%20Terror"&gt;War
on Terror&lt;/a&gt;". The report details communication failures with the &lt;a href="Islam"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt;
world, and notes that current efforts may have achieved the opposite
of their intended effect.

The report released without publicity the Wednesday before Thanksgiving by &lt;a href="w%3ADefense%20Science%20Board"&gt;Defense Science Board&lt;/a&gt;, focuses on a failure of communication, which the Defense Science Board considers vital to the war on terror. It asserts this failure of "strategic communication" contributes to a perceived "negative image in world opinion and diminished ability to persuade" of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, and that a resulting atmosphere of hostility can manifest in numerous ways.

The list of harmful effects includes "terrorism, thin coalitions, harmful effects on business, restrictions
on travel, declines in cross border tourism and education flows, and
damaging consequences for other elements of U.S. soft power".

According to the report, "The information campaign ... is an essential objective, because the larger goals of U.S. strategy depend on separating the vast majority of non-violent Muslims from the radical-militant Islamist-Jihadists. But American efforts have not only failed in this respect: they may also have achieved the opposite of what they intended."

By way of example, the report quotes figures from a June 2004 &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Zogby"&gt;Zogby&lt;/a&gt; poll, claiming to show a significant drop in Arab support for the U.S. in the past couple years. Statistical results are reproduced below.

The report further claims, "American direct intervention in the Muslim World has paradoxically elevated the stature of and support for radical Islamists." As summarised in a ♡❤Christian Science Monitor♡❤ headline, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.csmonitor.com/2004/1129/dailyUpdate.html"&gt;'They hate our policies, not our freedom'&lt;/a&gt;.

So why has support for the U.S. dropped? -- to single digits in some Arab nations. President Bush and others have famously claimed that America is hated for its freedom. But the Defense Science Board concluded that most Arabs "do not hate us for our values, but because of our policies." From the same Zogby study:

This study explains that while support for American values may not be overwhelming, it is practically non-existent for America's policies in the Middle East.

"The overwhelming majority voice their objections to what they see as one-sided support in favor of Israel and against Palestinian rights, and the longstanding, even increasing support for what Muslims collectively see as tyrannies, most notably Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Pakistan, and the Gulf states. Thus when American public diplomacy talks about bringing democracy to Islamic societies, this is seen as no more than self-serving hypocrisy."

In the eyes of Muslims, according to this report, America is really only looking out for its own interests.

It concludes from this that the fundamental problem with relations with the Muslim world is not a simple matter of crafting the right message. "Rather, it is a fundamental problem of credibility. Simply, there is none."

&lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt; reports that the company said most online dictionary queries were for uncommon terms, but people also turned to its Web sites for words in news headlines.

"That is what occurred in this year's election cycle ... with voluminous hits for words like 'incumbent,' 'electoral,' 'partisan,' and, of course, our number one Word of the Year, 'blog'," Merriam-Webster President and Publisher John Morse said in a statement.

The dictionary has been criticized however for its definition of a blog on a &lt;a href="http%3A//www.blogherald.com"&gt;blog news website&lt;/a&gt;, that described Merriam-Websters definition of a blog as a personal journal as "garbage" and "so &lt;a href="w%3A1999"&gt;1999&lt;/a&gt;".

&lt;a href="w%3ACupertino%2C%20California"&gt;CUPERTINO&lt;/a&gt; – Late today, &lt;a href="Apple%20Computer"&gt;Apple Computer Inc.&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AiTunes%20Music%20Store"&gt;iTunes Music Store&lt;/a&gt; (iTMS) was opened to Canadians. The 700,000+ songs are priced at CAD 99¢ (USD 84¢) per song, the lowest price of any iTMS localization to date. The Canada localization also provides customers the same personal rights for songs as with existing stores:

<ul>
BULLET::::- Ability to listen to a song on 5 computers.
BULLET::::- Unlimited CD burning.
BULLET::::- Burning the same playlist up to seven times.
BULLET::::- Unlimited iPod usage.

</ul>
iTMS Canada was announced during the launch of the &lt;a href="w%3AiPod%20photo"&gt;iPod photo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AiPod"&gt;iPod Special Edition: U2&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;EU&lt;/a&gt; iTMS on October 26. Apple CEO &lt;a href="Steve%20Jobs"&gt;Steve Jobs&lt;/a&gt; stated that the Canada localization was planned for November. Apple apologized today for missing its own deadline, and announced that the store will be launched "very soon." No reason was given for the delay.

iTMS Canada is another choice for Canadians in legal music downloads which includes Archambault.ca (&lt;a href="w%3AQuebecor"&gt;Quebecor Media Inc.&lt;/a&gt;), Napster.ca (The legal reincarnation of &lt;a href="w%3ANapster"&gt;Napster&lt;/a&gt;), and Puretracks.com (&lt;a href="w%3AMoontaxi"&gt;Moontaxi Media Inc.&lt;/a&gt;).

The Canada localization is the 13th nation to be added to iTMS following its launch in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; in April 2003; &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;U.K.&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; were added, in June of this year and all European Union countries, except &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, were added in October.

WASHINGTON, D.C. – &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;U.S. President George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; nominated Bernard B. Kerik, the police commissioner of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Police%20Department"&gt;New York Police Department&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; during the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%2C%202001%20attacks"&gt;September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , to succeed Tom Ridge as the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Homeland%20Security"&gt;Secretary of Homeland Security&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Kerik resigned as police commissioner two months following the terrorist attacks, citing the desire to spend more time with his family, 
but has since kept a very high profile. Following the invasion of Iraq, he chose to lead the training of Iraqi law enforcement. He campaigned for President George W. Bush in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20presidential%20election%2C%202004"&gt;2004 presidential election&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and delivered a prime time speech at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20National%20Convention"&gt;Republican National Convention&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Among other security qualifications, he has served in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Army"&gt;U.S. Army&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , as narcotics detective in the NYPD and as private security worker in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASaudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Kerik faces the daunting task of running the DHS, an agency assembled from 22 other agencies with over 180,000 employees.

WASHINGTON, DC – According to a report issued by &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;U.S. House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; Congressman &lt;a href="w%3AHenry%20Waxman"&gt;Henry A. Waxman&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;D&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;CA&lt;/a&gt;), the majority of &lt;a href="w%3Asexual%20abstinence"&gt;abstinence&lt;/a&gt;-only sexual education programs in schools contain incorrect or misleading information.

The report found that over 80% of the &lt;a href="w%3Acurriculum"&gt;curricula&lt;/a&gt; used by the recipients of the grants contained incorrect information, including the claim that &lt;a href="w%3Acondom"&gt;condom&lt;/a&gt;s did not prevent the spread of &lt;a href="w%3ASexually%20transmitted%20disease"&gt;STD&lt;/a&gt;s and that &lt;a href="w%3Aabortion"&gt;abortion&lt;/a&gt;s have a high chance of causing sterility.&lt;a href="http%3A//www.democrats.reform.house.gov/Documents/20041201102153-50247.pdf"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

These programs are funded by the federal government under &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President George W. Bush's&lt;/a&gt; faith-based initiative. According to the report, these abstinence programs&amp;mdash;promoted by the administration of President Bush&amp;mdash;are receiving increasing amounts of funding: nearly $170 million will be spent in 2005, which is more than double the spending on these programs in 2001.&lt;a href="http%3A//www.nytimes.com/2004/12/03/politics/03abstinence.html%3Foref%3Dlogin"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Under the faith-based initiative programs, the United States government allocates funds to religious and other community organizations that agree to carry out abstinence education programs which do not include coverage of any other methods of &lt;a href="w%3Abirth%20control"&gt;birth control&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3Asexually%20transmitted%20disease"&gt;sexually transmitted disease&lt;/a&gt; prevention, as well as other criteria.

The timing of the report is significant in that it comes on the heels of research from &lt;a href="w%3AColumbia%20University"&gt;Columbia University&lt;/a&gt; that found that nearly 9 of 10 teenagers who had pledged abstinence from pre-marital sex had broken their vows in the first six years since the pledges&lt;a href="http%3A//www.kaisernetwork.org/daily_reports/rep_index.cfm%3FDR_ID%3D22603"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. 

The Waxman Report and the Columbia University study describe some abstinence programs as factually wrong and/or ineffective. In a rebuttal, Dr. Alma L. Golden, a deputy assistant secretary in the Health and Human Services Department, said in a statement that Mr. Waxman's report "misses the boat" and that it took information out of context "for purely political reasons."&lt;a href="http%3A//www.nytimes.com/2004/12/03/politics/03abstinence.html%3Foref%3Dlogin"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

♡❤♡December 3, 2004♡❤♡

The &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo"&gt;Democratic Republic of the Congo&lt;/a&gt; may be preparing to have its troops face those of &lt;a href="w%3ARwanda"&gt;Rwanda&lt;/a&gt;, which have allegedly been sighted by United Nations personnel on the Congo side of the border. 

The United Nations is attempting to mediate the conflict but both sides of the conflict appear to be pursuing independent policies, with Congo's president accusing Rwanda of being predatory, and Rwandan president refusing to back down from the threat of pursuing Rwandan rebels across Congo's territory.

MADRID – The &lt;a href="w%3ABasque"&gt;Basque&lt;/a&gt; separatist group &lt;a href="w%3AETA"&gt;ETA&lt;/a&gt; was blamed for five explosions at gas stations in the &lt;a href="w%3ASpain"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; capital of &lt;a href="w%3AMadrid"&gt;Madrid&lt;/a&gt; on Friday. The explosions claimed no casualties, but two police officers were lightly wounded.

An anonymous caller contacted the &lt;a href="w%3ABasque"&gt;Basque&lt;/a&gt; newspaper &lt;a href="w%3AGara"&gt;Gara&lt;/a&gt; at 5.30pm local time, describing the location of the devices and naming ETA as responsible for the attacks. The bombings caused city-wide traffic jams, as police and rescue forces raced to secure the targets. The attacks ended a relatively peaceful phase of several months in the conflict between the &lt;a href="w%3ASpain"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; central government and &lt;a href="w%3ABasque"&gt;Basque&lt;/a&gt; extremists.

While leaders of ETA's political arm &lt;a href="w%3ABatasuna"&gt;Batasuna&lt;/a&gt; have recently hinted at the possibility of a ceasefire, the assault makes any form of dialogue with ETA unlikely in the near future. ETA is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union.

<h1>Delta 4 Heavy rocket poised for maiden launch</h1>
♡❤♡December 13, 2004♡❤♡

CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida - The first new heavy lift space vehicle in a generation is cleared to launch from &lt;a href="w%3ACape%20Canaveral%20Air%20Force%20Station"&gt;Cape Canaveral Air Force Station&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing"&gt;Boeing&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤♡&lt;a href="w%3ADelta%20IV%20rocket"&gt;Delta IV Heavy&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ has missed launch opportunities three days in a row (starting Friday, December 12) due to minor technical difficulties. It is now scheduled to launch Dec. 20 or 21 from pad SLC-37B.

The ♡❤♡Delta 4♡❤♡ was developed as part of the U.S Air Force's ♡❤Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle♡❤ program to reduce costs and improve reliability. The basic design is a two stage, cryogenic &lt;a href="w%3ABipropellant%20rocket"&gt;LOx/LH&lt;/a&gt; rocket. Strap-on boosters may be added to increase lift capacity. 

Two major obstacles have plagued the project in recent years; a bidding scandal which cost Boeing a large portion of the military satellite launch business for which it was competing, and a downturn in commercial satellite launches in 2001.

The ♡❤Heavy♡❤ variant of the Delta 4 rocket can place 13,100 kg (28,950 Lb) into &lt;a href="w%3AGeostationary%20transfer%20orbit"&gt;geostationary transfer orbit&lt;/a&gt;, greater than any other current rocket. Two additional first stage cores are used as strap-on boosters for this configuration. Their rated thrust is 2,900,000 N (656,000 lb) each. 

Delta 4's main engine, the RS68, is the most powerful hydrogen/liquid oxygen engine in the world, approximately three times as powerful as the &lt;a href="w%3AAriane%205"&gt;Ariane 5&lt;/a&gt; Vulcain HM60. Its design sacrifices efficiency for increased reliability and lower cost: rated &lt;a href="w%3Aspecific%20impulse"&gt;specific impulse&lt;/a&gt; is 365s at sea level and 410s in a vacuum. The second stage engine, Pratt and Whitney's RL-10B-2, has a specific impulse of 462s.

The primary market for this launcher will be classified &lt;a href="w%3Aspy%20satellites"&gt;spy satellites&lt;/a&gt; for the US intelligence community. Most of these satellites were previously launched on the Titan 4, which has since been retired. The Delta 4 Heavy's published launch cost is $170 million, compared to the Titan 4's $400 million (1999 dollars).

Delta 4 Heavy's maiden launch is a demonstration and will carry a dummy load and two nano-satellites. The main payload, dubbed ♡❤DemoSat♡❤ is a 6020 kg (13271 lb) mass designed to simulate the dynamic and initial properties of a real satellite. Its design consists of large brass rods, intended to fully burn up on reentry.

The two nano-satellites are part of the US Department of Defense ♡❤Nanosat-2 Program♡❤, and built by students from New Mexico State University, Arizona State University, and the University of Colorado at Boulder.

MAPUTO, Mozambique – The Mozambique presidential elections vote count continued Friday in all of the country, with &lt;a href="w%3AFrelimo"&gt;Frelimo&lt;/a&gt; and it's candidate Armando Guebuza leading, according to the preliminary results already known, and especially in &lt;a href="w%3AMaputo"&gt;Maputo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGaza%20Province"&gt;Gaza&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AInhambane"&gt;Inhambane&lt;/a&gt;, traditional regions of influence for the party in power.

With just over 400 thousand votes counted, the Frelimo candidate was ahead with 293 800 votes, against 108 807 to Afonso Dhlakama and 7899 to Raul Domingos. Unnoficial estimates report abstention levels to be between 70% and 80%.

If confirmed, these abstention levels could force a run-off next month, if neither candidate wins the 50% of votes necessary to win the elections.

Mozambique's official electoral commission is only obligated to announce the final results by Dec. 17.

<h2>Rain, Logistics and Cashew problems</h2>
Heavy rains, as well as extreme heat and logistics problems during the 2-day elections could explain the low voter turnout, but there could be other factors responsible for this, specifically the start of the &lt;a href="w%3Acashew"&gt;cashew&lt;/a&gt; season, a traditional source of income for a substantial part of the population.

The cashew season begins in late November, extending to February or March, mainly in four provinces: &lt;a href="w%3AGaza%20Province"&gt;Gaza&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AInhambane"&gt;Inhambane&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AFrelimo"&gt;Frelimo&lt;/a&gt; strongholds), and especially in &lt;a href="w%3AZambezia"&gt;Zambézia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANampula"&gt;Nampula&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ARenamo"&gt;Renamo&lt;/a&gt; strongholds).

Normally, the income obtained from this can sustain the workers for the rest of the year, and usually takes them away from their homes and voting centers.

Scientists using a computer model of the typical &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;an summer with no human influences (without &lt;a href="w%3Aglobal%20warming"&gt;global warming&lt;/a&gt;) have compared it to the same model with global warming included. They have concluded that human influence makes extremely warm summers (i.e. summers as warm as the 2003 heatwave) more than twice as likely.

Commentators have suggested that in the future this may open the way for &lt;a href="w%3Alawsuit"&gt;lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; against heavy polluters by persons whose livelihoods have been affected by adverse climate change. However, the report stesses that though it is in fact impossible to pin any specific extreme climate event on either global warming or natural climate variation, human activities increase the frequency of such events.

The study is based upon climate activity during the last 50 years, which can only be replicated with computer models which include human forcing (CO2 and other &lt;a href="w%3Agreenhouse%20gas"&gt;greenhouse gases&lt;/a&gt; (GHGs)). However, even within a warmer world the summer of 2003 was anomalously warm in Europe. Most simulations of 2003 climate produce cooler weather in Europe than what actually happened. It is not yet known if flaws in the models cause this difference, if the warmth of 2003 was part of a trend, or 2003 was merely unusually hot. If there will be a warming trend, a model predicts that such summers could become an event of 1-in-2 probability only by &lt;a href="w%3A2050"&gt;2050&lt;/a&gt;.

In the Americas, a series of sudden weather changes has been more frequent in the last 15 years since the discovery of the phenomenon knows as &lt;a href="w%3AEl%20nino"&gt;♡❤El Niño♡❤&lt;/a&gt;, in which vast regions of North and South America suffered weather extremes ranging from high tides to extreme hail, rain and snowstorms during summer and winter seasons following extremely hot summers. There's still no scientific evidence that ♡❤El Niño♡❤ is directly influenced by human factors.

BAGHDAD – Two &lt;a href="w%3ACar%20bomb"&gt;car bombs&lt;/a&gt; were detonated outside an &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraqi&lt;/a&gt; police station near the &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Zone"&gt;Green Zone&lt;/a&gt; here Saturday, killing 16 and wounding dozens. 

The attacks occurred near the Checkpoint 2 entrance at 9:30 a.m. Immediately after the blasts, a small arms attack was launched by rebels on Checkpoint 1. 

Entrances into the Green Zone, frequented by foreigners and journalists, were immediately sealed.

Among the four killed were police officers, and between 35 and 60 were reportedly wounded.

Snocap has signed an agreement with &lt;a href="w%3AUniversal%20Music"&gt;Universal Music Group&lt;/a&gt; to make the company's entire catalogue available through the new service. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.

According to Snocap's press release, the platform will include a copyright management interface, which will allow content owners to control the distribution of their intellectual property among users. The service's main competitor would be &lt;a href="w%3AApple%20Computer"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AiTunes%20Music%20Store"&gt;iTunes Music Store&lt;/a&gt;, which is currently the most widely used legal source of downloadable music.

KIEV - As events unfold in Ukraine, there is a noticeable tendency in news media to see the issues as a black-and-white struggle. They portray the current election crisis as a popular revolution reacting to the gross manipulation of an election in favour of the establishment candidate Viktor Yanukovich. However a look below the surface would show these issues to be more complex than appearances would suggest.

According to Agência Estado, members of the &lt;a href="Brazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;ian Landless Workers Movement (MST) are accused of beating to death Paulo Brizola Nunes. Mr. Nunes, 51 years old, was an employee of the Noroeste Farm in Cabixi, 820 km (510 miles) away from the regional capital of Porto Velho, &lt;a href="w%3ARondonia"&gt;Rondonia&lt;/a&gt;. The farm was considered at risk of invasion due to its proximity to a MST encampment. 

Nunes and another employee of Noroeste Farm known as "Coco" were on a motorcycle when they were allegedly attacked. MST members allegedly extended barbed wire across the road to down the two men, who were then pummelled with axes and sticks. Coco escaped to a Cabixi police station but Nunes was rendered unconscious and did not survive the assault.

MST is a large &lt;a href="w%3AMarxist"&gt;Marxist&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3AMaoist"&gt;Maoist&lt;/a&gt; inspired movement of agricultural workers in Brazil, officially founded in 1984. The movement claims to pursue equitable redistribution of Brazilian farmland. In 2003 there were 632 MST camps in Brazil, containing 116,382 families. According to a recent report on labor standards in Brazil, conditions for laborers are poor. Currently, MST receives financial help from the Brazilian government and donations from international organizations. The movement also receives funds by selling videos of their invasions and other products like books, flags and caps. 

MST's most visible tactic has been their armed occupation of mostly privately-held plantations and landholdings. However, some Brazilians have protested MST's use of violence. Many farms hire gunfighters to protect their properties from invasions as MST is known to permanently evict farmholders. MST claims they use arms only to defend themselves from the gunfighters.

<h1>Thai government drops origami cranes as message of peace</h1>

&lt;a href="w%3ABangkok"&gt;BANGKOK&lt;/a&gt; – 
Millions of &lt;a href="w%3Aorigami"&gt;origami&lt;/a&gt; cranes have been dropped on Thailand's three southern provinces following violence between the government and ethnic minority &lt;a href="w%3AMuslim"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; populations. The move has been called a "goodwill gesture" towards Muslims.

Up to 120 million such paper sculptures were dropped on Thailand's three southern-most provinces, &lt;a href="w%3ANarathiwat"&gt;Narathiwat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APattani"&gt;Pattani&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AYala"&gt;Yala&lt;/a&gt;. Tensions in this area have increased recently, peaking with the recent death of 85 demonstrators arrested during a protest. The government blamed their deaths on physical weakness due to fasting in the month of &lt;a href="w%3ARamadan"&gt;Ramadan&lt;/a&gt; as the cause, as most if not all the deaths occurred during transport of up to 500 arrested protestors. Critics of the Thai government have called for the resignation of Prime Minister &lt;a href="Thaksin%20Shinawatra"&gt;Thaksin Shinawatra&lt;/a&gt;, blaming the "over-eagerness" of Thai security forces as the cause of the deaths.

The dispersal was timed to coincide with the birthday of Thailand's King &lt;a href="w%3ABhumibol%20Adulyadej"&gt;Bhumibol Adulyadej&lt;/a&gt;, and has generated much interest from the rest of the country's predominantly &lt;a href="w%3ABuddhism"&gt;Buddhist&lt;/a&gt; population. 
The cranes were built by citizens throughout Thailand and had peace messages written on them. The southern, Muslim provinces are often considered neglected by a north that is larger and of the majority ethnic group. Some have welcomed the goodwill gesture, but critics in both the north and south have said that the resources would have been better spent solving the problems in the south. Some &lt;a href="w%3AIslam"&gt;Islamic&lt;/a&gt; leaders in the south have also expressed concerns that the gesture may not be properly understood by Muslims, as the &lt;a href="w%3ACrane%20%28bird%29"&gt;crane&lt;/a&gt; carries no cultural significance with them.

&lt;a href="w%3AAlmeria"&gt;ALMERIA, Spain&lt;/a&gt;. - A small explosive device was deactivated today by the Spanish police in &lt;a href="w%3AAlmeria"&gt;Almería&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAndaluc%C3%ADa"&gt;Andalucía&lt;/a&gt;.

The bomb was hidden inside a small bag, accompanied by a note signed by &lt;a href="w%3AETA"&gt;ETA&lt;/a&gt;, and was set to explode at 13:30 on Monday, December 6, a national holiday to celebrate the Spanish Constitution. The explosive device was found by police while patrolling the Plaza de España (Spain Square), according to a memo by the Ministry of Interior, and was deactivated by a bomb squad without having to explode it.

The Civil Guard calculated that the device carried less than 200 grams of explosive, about the same amount as the bombs placed in 5 gas stations in Madrid on Friday, according to "El Mundo". The Spanish Minister of Interior, José Antonio Alonso, appealed for the population to remain calm and trust the authorities.

&lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20DC"&gt;Washington, DC&lt;/a&gt; – The "War on Drugs" waged by the United States has been criticized in a report released by the Washington D.C.-left wing based human rights group &lt;a href="http%3A//www.wola.org/"&gt;Washington Office on Latin America&lt;/a&gt;. The report, "Drugs and Democracy in Latin America: The Impact of U.S. Policy" (&lt;a href="http%3A//www.wola.org/publications/ddhr_exec_sum_brief.pdf"&gt;Summary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APortable%20Document%20Format"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;), investigated "the impact of drug control policies on human rights and democracy" &lt;a href="http%3A//www.wola.org/publications/ddhr_exec_sum_brief.pdf"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and declared that present policies in the War on Drugs have failed to achieve any meaningful success.

The United States government's primary aim in the War on Drugs is to reduce the volume of illegal narcotics imported into the United States. By reducing imports, prices of the drugs will rise and, so the government reasons, drug use will decline. The government's efforts are primarily directed towards eradication of crops used to produce finished drugs, and towards strengthening the governments of regions in which drugs are produced by offering military and financial aid, the most notable of which is &lt;a href="w%3AColombia"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;.

The 400-page WOLA report documents evidence that U.S. efforts to combat illegal drugs in the Americas have served to weaken democratic instutions in Latin America, and have placed the burden of the drug war upon the poorest of their citizens. Co-editor of the report, Coletta A. Youngers maintains that the U.S. policy of crop eradication generates "social unrest, instability and violence" as poor farmers are having their source of income destroyed. Youngers further states that U.S. policies "have contributed to confusing military and law-enforcement functions, militarizing local police forces, and bringing the military into a domestic law enforcement role. They have thus strengthened military forces at the expense of civilian authorities – in a region with a tragic history of military rule" &lt;a href="http%3A//www.wola.org/publications/ddhr_exec_sum_brief.pdf"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

As a measure of their success in the War on Drugs, the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov"&gt;Office of National Drug Control Policy&lt;/a&gt; points to statistics from 2001, which are the most recent published on the ONDCP website, that show a decline in the worldwide level of coca cultivation &lt;a href="http%3A//www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/publications/international/factsht/cocaine.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The ONDCP also claims success in interdiction efforts and highlights statistics on drug arrests within the United States as measurable achievements in the War on Drugs &lt;a href="http%3A//www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/international/factsheets.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. 

However, the Drug Enforcement Agency's latest statistics (from 2003) show street prices of drugs to be near an all-time low &lt;a href="http%3A//www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/intel/02058/02058.html%232"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The same DEA report also concedes that most drugs "are readily available". 

While a senior ONDCP official has stated that the WOLA report "is filled with errors, irrelevancies, and misinterpretations" &lt;a href="http%3A//www.antiwar.com/lobe/%3Farticleid%3D4089"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, WOLA has called for a renewed debate on drug war policies, supported by their findings and the latest government statistics that show illegal narcotics to be cheaper and more plentiful than ever before.

WOLA was founded in 1974 by Joseph Eldridge, Joyce Hill of the National Council of Churches and Thomas Quigley of the U.S. Catholic Conference. Quigley led the Religious Task Force on El Salvador, part of a coalition called Committee In Solidarity With the People of El Salvador (CIPES). Papers captured in El Salvador belonging to FMLN guerrilla leader, Farid Handal, "documented CIPES' connections with member groups of the Latin network and the international communist movement( Richard P. McBrien, Catholicism, Harper/Collins, NY, new edition 1994, p. 682).

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Vanuatu%20PM%20accused%20of%20assaulting%20envoy&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

PORT VILA, Vanuatu – &lt;a href="w%3ASerge%20Vohor"&gt;Serge Vohor&lt;/a&gt;, the Prime Minister of &lt;a href="w%3AVanuatu"&gt;Vanuatu&lt;/a&gt;, recently came into spotlight as the newest battleground in the diplomatic war between the &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20of%20China"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;, was accused of pushing the ambassador from the People's Republic of China, Mr. Bao Shusheng.

Mr. Bao, the newly-installed envoy from &lt;a href="w%3ABeijing"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt;, yesterday complained to the press that he was "punched on the shoulder" by Mr. Vohor after the parliamentary session ended last Wednesday (December 1). Mr. Bao approached Mr. Vohor at the time to complain that the &lt;a href="w%3Aflag%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;flag of Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; was still flying in the capital city, even after the council of ministers has already made the decision to take it down.

"I then approached him just outside of parliament where I waited for him again at the main entrance. He then shook his fist right in my face and punched me on my right shoulder." said Mr. Bao, "I was shocked at what happened, but his bodyguards stepped in and the prime minister then rushed to his car. This has deeply offended me and my country."

However Mr. Bao decided today not to file a formal protest or make a police report. The incident has been publicised on Vanuatu's local newspapers, one of which called it "another indiscretion for which Vohor should resign". Mr. Vohor had already faced a no-confidence vote by the opposition members of parliament before the incident for his decision to establish a diplomatic relationship with Taiwan.

The opposition MPs are confident that the no-confidence vote would pass in the parliament, as 16 more MPs have recently deserted Mr. Vohor and sided with the opposition, which now holds a 36 to 14 majority in the 52-member parliament, including the prime minister himself and the speaker.

Mr. Vohor has been in office for only four months and his position now seems precarious, after his secret visit to Taiwan last month. In this trip he signed a &lt;a href="w%3Acommunique"&gt;communique&lt;/a&gt; recognising the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20of%20China"&gt;Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; (the official name of Taiwan) as a sovereign state. But the country's council of ministers, which is Vanuatu's ruling body, revoked the deal and reiterated to Beijing its commitment to the &lt;a href="w%3AOne-China%20Policy"&gt;one-China policy&lt;/a&gt;, which is a pre-requesite for maintaining formal diplomatic ties with the People's Republic of China, which sees Taiwan as its 23rd province and the Republic of China as a defunct entity. Currently the Republic of China maintains formal diplomatic relationships with 27 countries, including Vanuatu.

LISBON – The President of the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Commission"&gt;European Commission&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9%20Dur%C3%A3o%20Barroso"&gt;José Manuel Durão Barroso&lt;/a&gt;, said holding a referendum on acceding to the European Constitution in &lt;a href="w%3APortugal"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt; is inadvisable, in light of the current political crisis in that country.

"A political crisis is surely not the best moment to discuss the European Constitution", Barroso said to the press outside a &lt;a href="w%3Acolloquium"&gt;colloquium&lt;/a&gt; about European Identity in Lisbon.

The E.C. President refused to comment on the current situation in Portugal, but admitted to have been "surprised" by the Portuguese President's decision to call for new elections, ending the government's term a full year early.

Barroso was the former Prime Minister of the current Portuguese government and leader of the ruling PSD party. He stepped down to accept the nomination for President of the European Commission, favouring current Prime-Minister &lt;a href="w%3APedro%20Santana%20Lopes"&gt;Pedro Santana Lopes&lt;/a&gt; as his successor.

The Portuguese President, &lt;a href="w%3AJorge%20Sampaio"&gt;Jorge Sampaio&lt;/a&gt;, announced his intention to dissolve the Parliament on Tuesday, November 30 and call for new elections. The decision is not yet final but should be settled no later than Friday, after the President has had an opportunity to consult political parties and others concerned. While it awaits the President's decision, the Parliament will vote on the new State Budget for 2005 today, amid protests from the opposition.

KABUL – Following his win in the presidential election on October 9, Hamid Karzai was sworn in today as the first-ever elected president of Afghanistan.

Although widely hailed as the start of a new era, both Karzai and Afghanistan face difficult challenges ahead. Insurgencies continue and drug lords still control much of the ethnically-divided country. But the peaceful and democratic vote indicates to many that Afghanistan is on the right track.

The &lt;a href="http%3A//www.elections-afghanistan.org.af/"&gt;Joint Electoral Management Body&lt;/a&gt; declared that Mr. Hamid Karzai won 55 percent of the vote in the election. An expert panel, appointed in the aftermath to investigate complaints about improper balloting, verified earlier today that there were shortcomings with the elections. While the panel said the problems that were identified "could not have materially affected the overall result," it hopes the findings will be used to improve the operations of future elections.

Former &lt;a href="w%3AHouston%20Rockets"&gt;Houston Rockets&lt;/a&gt; star &lt;a href="w%3ACalvin%20Murphy"&gt;Calvin Murphy&lt;/a&gt;, accused of molestation by five of daughters, was found not guilty by the jury, putting an end to the eight-month long trial.

The alleged incidents took place more than ten years ago, when the daughters, who are now grown, ranged in age from 6 to 16. They accused Murphy of fondling them and performing oral sex on them. Murphy has 14 children by nine women.

Murphy's attorney claimed that the women's accusations were false and that they were bitter because he did not treat them the same as he treated the children born to his ex-wife. Murphy's two daughters who were products of his previous marriage came to his defense. 

The jury indicated that they found the women's statements unreliable.
The former basketball star's lawyers said three of the five daughters had been trying to claim $52,408 in death benefits left in a teachers retirement account belonging to their mother, Phyllis Davidson. Murphy had a 20-year relationship and four children with Davidson, who died in a car accident in 1996.

This year, the three daughters continued their grandmother's attempt to stop Murphy from receiving the benefits. He was listed as the account's beneficiary, according to court records.

On Feb. 20, letters went to Murphy, his three daughters and their grandmother that Murphy was the account's rightful beneficiary. The money was never paid.

A month later, Murphy was arrested and charged with sexual abuse and indecency. 

Because of the nature of the accusations, Murphy lost his job with the Houston Rockets, where he was a TV commentator. Murphy has not commented about if he has plans to return to a broadcasting career.

Stockholm, Sweden – ♡❤♡An explosion during the early hours of Wednesday blew a big hole in a house in central Stockholm. The tenant, a 48 year old man suspected of stealing valuable books from the Royal Library, is missing. Two persons were lightly injured in the explosion.♡❤♡

The cause of the explosion is not yet known. The apartment has been searched with specially trained dogs, but nothing was found. This does not rule out the possibility of explosives, just that none of the more common ones were used, according to Swedish police. Another possibility is a gas leak.

The whereabouts of the tenant is not known. Attempts to search the apartment for a body was stopped by further collapsing of the apartment. The apartment will, in accordance with the usual police routines, be secured before a crime scene investigation can be made. 

The man had been in custody for a month on charges of theft from the &lt;a href="w%3ASwedish%20Royal%20Library"&gt;Royal Library&lt;/a&gt; in Stockholm. He is suspected of having stolen books worth hundreds of thousands of dollars and has given a partial confession. Some books were found in his apartment on a previous occasion. He was released from custody this Friday.

Stockholm, Sweden – Claes-Göran Johansson, safety expert on Fortum, the gas provider, says that nothing indicated a gas explosion. "Normally such a large explosion would have started a fire". He also claims that such a large explosion should not be possible by accident.

PONTIAC, Michigan – After spending weeks going over written statements, TV video and even fan shot video, &lt;a href="w%3AOakland%20County"&gt;Oakland County&lt;/a&gt; Prosecutor David Gorcyca announced criminal charges against five Indiana Pacer players and seven fans stemming from the November 19th brawl at &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Palace%20Of%20Auburn%20Hills"&gt;The Palace Of Auburn Hills&lt;/a&gt;.

Stephen Jackson, David Harison, Ron Artest and Anthony Johnson were all charged with one count of assault and battery. Three time NBA All-Star Jermaine O’Neal was charged with two counts of assault and battery. Each charge is a misdemeanor that carries a maximum penalty of 3 months in jail and a fine up to $500.

Gorcyca also filed charges against seven fans. John Green, John Ackerman, William Paulson, Bryant Jackson and David Wallace were all charged with assault and battery. David Wallace is the brother of Detroit Piston star, Ben Wallace. 

John Green was charged with two counts of assault and battery. The first one for tossing the cup that started the brawl and another count for punching Artest from behind when Artest went into the stands. 

Bryant Jackson also faces a felony assault charge for throwing a chair. That is punishable by up to four years in jail, but Gorcyca said Jackson may serve more time based on his prior convictions.

Two other fans, Charlie Haddad and Alvin Shackleford, were also charged with a local ordinance that prevents fans from walking onto the floor. All seven fans have been banned from The Palace.

&lt;a href="w%3ALOS%20ANGELES"&gt;LOS ANGELES&lt;/a&gt; – A commuter van (Van Pool No. 36) from the &lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;National Aeronautics and Space Administration's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJet%20Propulsion%20Laboratory"&gt;Jet Propulsion Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; (JPL) plunged 200 feet into a ravine in the &lt;a href="w%3AAngeles%20National%20Forest"&gt;Angeles National Forest&lt;/a&gt; this morning. The van was carrying ten people: six JPL employees, two NASA employees, and two private contractors. They are identified as: 

<ul>

</ul>
Three of the passengers -- Forks, Galloway, and Agey -- lost their lives; the remaining seven sustained various levels of injury, including one passenger suffering critical injury, according to authorities. All victims were airlifted to local area hospitals.

According to witnesses who reported the crash, the van simply drove off the side of Angeles Forest Highway. Despite the presence of fog during the accident, the &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%20Highway%20Patrol"&gt;California Highway Patrol&lt;/a&gt; believes that this was not a factor. The CHP has said that the investigation into the crash may take two to three days before the cause is known.

JPL spokesperson D.C. Agle confirmed that the van was from the facility. Initially, JPL refrained from commenting, but JPL security was spotted at the site shortly after the incident occurred.

The Angeles Forest Highway is a two-lane mountain road considered a commuter route for many residents of the &lt;a href="w%3AAntelope%20Valley"&gt;Antelope Valley&lt;/a&gt; including &lt;a href="w%3APalmdale%2C%20California"&gt;Palmdale&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALancaster%2C%20California"&gt;Lancaster&lt;/a&gt; residents. It is an alternative to get to &lt;a href="w%3AInterstate%20210"&gt;Interstate 210&lt;/a&gt;, rather than taking the heavily traveled Antelope Valley Freeway (California State Route 14).

&lt;a href="w%3ACamp%20Buehring"&gt;Camp Buehring, Kuwait&lt;/a&gt; – U.S. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, after a speech to U.S. soldiers at an American military base in Kuwait, was confronted by Iraq-bound soldiers raising their concerns over a variety of issues.

During a question-and-answer session of unscreened questions following his speech at Camp Buehring, Rumsfeld replied to soldier's concerns over aging equipment and a lack of armor for military vehicles. One soldier, Spc. Thomas Wilson, received applause from the gathered troops after asking the defense secretary, "Why do we soldiers have to dig through local landfills for pieces of scrap metal and compromised ballistic glass to up-armor our vehicles?" &lt;a href="http%3A//story.news.yahoo.com/news%3Ftmpl%3Dstory2%26amp%3Bu%3D/ap/20041208/ap_on_re_mi_ea/rumsfeld"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Rumsfeld hesitated, then replied, "You go to war with the Army you have, not the Army you might want or wish to have." Rumsfeld further clarified that the Pentagon was making all possible effort to provide the materials required as quickly as possible, but that it has been difficult to keep up with demand.

However, a recent claim by a company producing such armor for the Pentagon has contradicted this assertion. "We've been telling the Pentagon for months that we have the capacity to double our production," &lt;a href="http%3A//www.azcentral.com/news/articles/1210armor10.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; said Matt Salmon, a consultant for ArmorWorks of Tempe, AZ. ArmorWorks, which has a $30 million contract with the Pentagon to supply armor kits to be fitted on Humvee vehicles, claims to be operating at only half-capacity, with little to no interest shown by the Pentagon in increasing their output.

Rumsfeld also addressed an expressed concern regarding aging equipment by asserting that, although all units have equipment of various vintage, troops headed into a combat situation in Iraq are equipped with the newest and best equipment the military can provide &lt;a href="http%3A//www.nytimes.com/2004/12/08/international/middleeast/08cnd-rumsfeld.html%3Fex%3D1260248400%26amp%3Ben%3D29636b52c700d57a%26amp%3Bei%3D5088%26amp%3Bpartner%3Drssnyt"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Maj. Gen. Gary Speer, the deputy commanding general of U.S. forces in Kuwait, stated that every vehicle deploying to Iraq from Kuwait has at least "Level 3" armor protection. According to Speer, this means the vehicle has locally fabricated armor for its side panels, but not bulletproof windows or reinforced floorboards. He was not aware of soldiers retrieving used bulletproof glass or scrap metal from landfills.

It is difficult to estimate the seriousness of the problems cited by the soldiers, and the Army claims to be unaware of widespread shortages in necessary equipment. However, enough soldiers have expressed concern (&lt;a href="http%3A//edition.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/europe/01/15/uk.bodyarmour/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http%3A//www.marinetimes.com/story.php%3Ff%3D1-292925-453911.php"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http%3A//www.boston.com/news/world/middleeast/articles/2004/03/08/iraq_death_spurs_push_for_humvee_armor/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) since the start of combat in Iraq to have provoked a reevalution within the military on the amount and type of protection U.S. forces require in Iraq &lt;a href="http%3A//wwws.house.gov/search97cgi/s97_cgi%3Faction%3DView%26amp%3BVdkVgwKey%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww%252Ehouse%252Egov%252Fapps%252Flist%252Fpress%252Fnj03%255Fsaxton%252Fpro4o512fastTrackAcquis%252Ehtml%26amp%3BDocOffset%3D1%26amp%3BDocsFound%3D1%26amp%3BQueryZip%3Diraq%2Barmor%26amp%3BSourceQueryZip%3D%26amp%3BCollection%3Dcomms%26amp%3BCollection%3Dmembers%26amp%3BCollection%3Dother%26amp%3BCollection%3Dcoxreport%26amp%3BViewTemplate%3Dmemberview%252Ehts%26amp%3B"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Rumsfeld also faced questions from the soldiers regarding the army's 'stop-loss' policy and dismissed concerns over the allegation that Army troops receive better equipment than National Guard troops. "No way I can prove it, but I'm told that the army is breaking its neck to see that there is not a differentiation" in the quality of equipment&lt;a href="http%3A//story.news.yahoo.com/news%3Ftmpl%3Dstory2%26amp%3Bu%3D/nm/20041208/pl_nm/iraq_usa_rumsfeld_dc"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Shortly after the speech, Rumsfeld continued on his way to &lt;a href="w%3AKabul"&gt;Kabul&lt;/a&gt; to watch President Karzai be sworn in.

Historically, the United Kingdom's closest partner in this endeavor has been the Federal Republic of Germany. The United States government has famously refused to ratify the &lt;a href="w%3AKyoto%20Protocol"&gt;Kyoto Protocol&lt;/a&gt; to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Blair sais also that the Kyoto Protocol doesn't go far enough. He would like to involve the private sector also and he has put this item on top of the &lt;a href="w%3AG8"&gt;G8&lt;/a&gt;, so all the large countries of the world have to talk about it.

Mr Byers said yesterday: "The reality is that unless we can get the United States engaged - responsible as it is for around a quarter of the world's carbon dioxide emissions - then any hopes of successfully tackling global warming will be doomed to failure. 

Some sources are saying, Blair is saying these things because he can make the more progressive voters change their mind, so they would vote for him.

MULAN, WESTERN AUSTRALIA – Under a draft plan of the Australian Federal Government's "mutual obligation" agreements, members of the Aboriginal community Mulan in Western Australia will be obliged to ensure that homes and yards are clean, students attend school, rubbish bins are emptied twice a week and that children undertake frequent facewashing.

As a "quid pro quo" the community will receive $172,000 AUD in federal funding for petrol bowsers and fuel stations, while the Western Australian Government will provide regular testing for skin infections, worm infestations and the eye condition trachoma, which is widespread in Mulan.

Community administrator Mark Sewell approached Wayne Gibbons, a former Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission chief executive, to initate an agreement four months, once it became clear that the face-washing program at the Mulan Catholic school was having a positive effect. The program, which has been running for eighteen months, has reduced the levels of trachoma among students from 80% to 16%.

Presently, the residents of Mulan must drive 44km to the nearby community of Balgo for fuel. 

Acting race discrimination commissioner, Tom Calma, has approved the deal, despite concerns from members of the Mulan community. Aboriginal lawyer and land rights activist Michael Mansell claimed that placing conditions on funding is unlawful and unenforceable. The government proposal has been widely labelled as 'humiliating' to the community.

Buenos Aires – The &lt;a href="http%3A//unfccc.int/meetings/cop_10/items/2944.php"&gt;10th session of the Conference of Parties&lt;/a&gt; (COP 10) is being held in the &lt;a href="w%3AArgentina"&gt;Argentine&lt;/a&gt; capital of &lt;a href="w%3ABuenos%20Aires%2C%20Argentina"&gt;Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt;; signatories of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Framework%20Convention%20on%20Climate%20Change"&gt;United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change&lt;/a&gt; have gathered to discuss issues involving &lt;a href="w%3Aglobal%20warming"&gt;global warming&lt;/a&gt;. Senior U.S. negotiator Dr. Harlan Watson came under fire for the United States' refusal to ratify the almost 10 year old &lt;a href="w%3AKyoto%20Protocol"&gt;Kyoto Treaty&lt;/a&gt; (AKA: Kyoto Protocol) which aims to reduce the emission of 6 &lt;a href="w%3Agreenhouse%20gas"&gt;greenhouse gases&lt;/a&gt; in the 55+ signatory nations and requires participating industrialized countries to give money and technology to developing countries.

Watson countered these complaints by arguing that, "Kyoto is a political agreement, it's not based on science." He also stated that the United States remains steadfast to its current position on global climate change. Supporters of the Kyoto Treaty state the protocol's required actions are not sufficient to effect their claimed warming effects.

&lt;a href="w%3AScottsdale%2C%20Arizona"&gt;SCOTTSDALE, ARIZONA&lt;/a&gt; – 
Former heavyweight boxer &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Tyson"&gt;Mike Tyson&lt;/a&gt; was arrested on Tuesday for allegedly jumping on the hood of a man's car outside a nightclub in late November. The incident occurred at 1 a.m. at the Pussycat Lounge. The driver of the car, who identified himself as "Asaf Alikadic" to authorities, claimed that Tyson jumped on the hood of his car while he was leaving the nightclub, causing $1,400 in damage to the vehicle. The man does not plan to press charges but wants the damages paid for.

Tyson has a history of criminal behavior and violence outside of the boxing ring. Among other incidents Tyson has served time for rape, has been in litigation and had criminal charges brought against him for other altercations involving automobiles. Inside the boxing ring, Tyson is only a shadow of his former self. 

Tyson was released after being given a citation. A court date is to be scheduled within ten days.

Sacramento, CA – 
♡❤♡A US veteran sergeant reports witnessing torture in Iraq and the cover-up activities of his commanding officers.♡❤♡

Honorably discharged US veteran, Sergeant Frank "Greg" Ford reports that he witnessed war crimes in Samarra, Iraq.

&lt;a href="http%3A//www.democracynow.org"&gt;Democracy Now!&lt;/a&gt; interviewed David DeBatto on it's December 12, 2004 show. David wrote &lt;a href="http%3A//www.salon.com/news/feature/2004/12/08/coverup/print.html"&gt;Whitewashing torture?&lt;/a&gt;, which is an account of Sergeant Frank "Greg" Ford's report on Iraqi prisoner abuse at his base in Samarra, Iraq. DeBatto, a former counterintelligence officer in Iraq, is currently authoring a four-part fiction series, as well as working as a journalist.

In &lt;a href="http%3A//www.salon.com/news/feature/2004/12/08/coverup/print.html"&gt;Whitewashing torture?&lt;/a&gt;, DeBatto explains that Sergeant Ford witnessed the torture and abuse of Iraqi detainees over a two to three week period in the spring of 2003 by his fellow intelligence operatives. Ford attempted to confront his team leader several times without success, and eventually went to his commanding officer Captain Victor Artiga in order to file a formal complaint. According to Ford, instead of an investigation being conducted, he was given thirty seconds by Captain Artiga to retract his complaint. When Ford didn't comply, he was immediately stripped of his weapon and assigned a 24-hour escort. Shortly after he was told to report to an army psychiatrist for a "combat stress evaluation". The psychiatrist deemed Ford to be "completely normal" and filed her report with Captain Artiga. 

According to a witness, Sergeant First Class Michael Marciello, when Artiga saw the psychiatrist's report, Artiga was, "livid". He "stormed" back to the psychiatrist and "browbeat" her to change her report to read that Ford was mentally unstable, and ordered her to have Ford shipped out of the country. Ford was later strapped to a medical gurney and medvac'd out of Iraq. He was initially sent to Kuwait and eventually to Landstuhl, Germany. Ford then underwent psychological evaluation in Germany and also two bases in the United States for approximately 8 months.

David DeBatto indicated he reviewed hundreds of documents regarding Ford's case and couldn't find any of the required documents that should be filed when a soldier is medvac'd from one area to another. David also stated that every doctor that evaluated Ford found him to be completely normal, with absolutely no psychological or mental health issues.

DeBatto reported that Ford was not the only soldier to have this happen to him. According to Col. C. Tsai, a military psychiatrist who examined Ford at the Army Regional Medical Center in Landstuhl, Germany, there had been three or four other soldiers who had been sent there under very similar circumstances. Specifically, the soldiers had made allegations of abuse or mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners. DeBatto indicated he had even came across a decorated veteran from the first Gulf War who made allegations and has committed to a mental ward in Kentucky. According to DeBatto, that officer is still fighting his committal. Tsai had found nothing at all unstable about Ford.

DeBatto reported that Ford was eventually given an honorable discharge in February, 2004. He is currently looking into filing civil and criminal charges against the officers involved. He has contacted the FBI, the Department of the Army's Office of the Inspector General, as well as the Army's Criminal Investigation Division. All three agencies have initiated criminal and administrative investigations into the incident.

BRISBANE – 
The final &lt;a href="w%3Aone-day%20cricket"&gt;one-day cricket&lt;/a&gt; match between &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; has ended with no result after the game was called off due to rain.

The lack of a result means that the inaugural &lt;a href="w%3AChappell-Hadlee%20Trophy"&gt;Chappell-Hadlee Trophy&lt;/a&gt; will not be awarded, as the series was tied at one game each. In the first game, New Zealand scored a thrilling victory from behind to win with two balls to spare, while in the second game, Australia knocked New Zealand over with 17 balls to spare after a valiant fightback attempt by &lt;a href="w%3AKyle%20Mills"&gt;Kyle Mills&lt;/a&gt;. 

Australia will next meet New Zealand in international cricket in February of 2006, when the Australian team will tour New Zealand and play three one-day internationals. 

New Zealand &lt;a href="w%3Aspin%20bowler"&gt;spin bowler&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Vettori"&gt;Daniel Vettori&lt;/a&gt; was proclaimed to be the man of the series, and took away a 42-inch plasma television as a prize.

<h1>Lycos Europe ends its anti-spam campaign</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Lycos%20Europe%20ends%20its%20anti-spam%20campaign&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="Europe"&gt;EUROPE&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;a href="http%3A//www.lycos-europe.com"&gt;Lycos Europe&lt;/a&gt; has ended its anti-spam operation: "Make Love Not Spam." A company spokesperson said the objective of the time-limited campaign was to raise people's awareness. The reasons why it ended the campaign was variously reported and speculated in media. The operation, while fairly popular, suffered unexpected troubles and drew criticism from security experts and others from the start. 

The company started distributing a &lt;a href="w%3Ascreensaver"&gt;screensaver&lt;/a&gt; on November 29, 2004 on &lt;a href="http%3A//makelovenotspam.com"&gt;makelovenotspam.com&lt;/a&gt;. Once installed, the computer would send HTTP requests to spammers' servers when not in use. The intent was to raise the running costs of those servers. Lycos coordinated these requests by choosing targets from lists generated by organizations such as &lt;a href="http%3A//www.spamcop.com"&gt;Spamcop.com&lt;/a&gt;. The servers were monitored so as to keep them under heavy load, but alive. 

Security experts roundly criticized the program. Steve Linford, director of a non-profit anti-spam organization SpamHaus, and Graham Cluley, a senior technology consultant of Sophos, pointed out that lowering moral standards to fight spammers was not a good idea. The legality of attacking the servers was also debated since it resembles "&lt;a href="w%3ADenial-of-service%20attack"&gt;Distributed Denial of Service&lt;/a&gt;" attacks (DDoS), except that Lycos did not completely shut down the target servers. 

Other troubles arose. The day after the campaign was launched, there was an alleged takeover of the web site's top page by a cracker. The page was replaced with a warning against the use of the screensaver, according to a screenshot sent via email to the Finnish security firm F-Secure. A Lycos spokesperson said that the screenshot was a hoax: there was no trace of intrusion in the server log and the site was simply unavailable due to a high demand. 

Some Internet service providers blocked either the traffic to Lycos-Europe, or the requests generated by the screensaver. 

Next, one of the targeted sites redirected all traffic to the Lycos' server, making Lycos itself a target. The company had maintained that its server was immune from the attack. Lycos stopped distributing the program on December 3, 2004 and asked clients to "stay tuned." The company later ended the program. 

On December 6, F-Secure reported a virus email disguised as the anti-spam screensaver. When its attachment (a zip file) is opened, it self-extracts and installs a "&lt;a href="w%3ATrojan%20horse%20%28computing%29"&gt;Trojan horse&lt;/a&gt;" --harmful program disguised as legitimate software. The Trojan horse was set up to monitor keystrokes in order to steal passwords, bank account numbers and other important information. 

Lycos' software had been downloaded more than 100,000 times by the end of the campaign.

<h1>South American Community of Nations announced at Third South American Summit</h1>
♡❤♡December 2004♡❤♡

South American nations began the creation of an international economic and legislative bloc by a declaration made at the Third South American Summit on 8 December. Named the &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20American%20Community%20of%20Nations"&gt;South American Community of Nations&lt;/a&gt;, the organization is a step toward greater coordination among South American states.

Two existing South American trade blocs, the &lt;a href="w%3AAndean%20Community"&gt;Andean Community&lt;/a&gt; (Comunidad Andina) and the &lt;a href="w%3AMercosur"&gt;Southern Common Market&lt;/a&gt; (Mercado Común del Sur, or Mercosur), have been combined and three previously uninvolved states included to create the community. 

The summit, held between 7-9 December at &lt;a href="w%3ACuzco"&gt;Cusco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAyacucho"&gt;Ayacucho&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Peru"&gt;Peru&lt;/a&gt;, was attended by heads of state from Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela. Foreign ministers attended for Argentina, Ecuador, Paraguay, and Uruguay. The summit was convened principally to sign the two-page Preamble to the Foundation Act of the South American Union on the second day of the summit. Although the Bolivian and Colombian presidents attended the summit, they did not attend the signing ceremony, this instead being done by representatives. Central American states &lt;a href="w%3AMexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APanama"&gt;Panama&lt;/a&gt; attended the ceremony as observers.

The locations for the summit were chosen for their historical significance and their association with events that reflect well on South America. Cusco was the ancient capital of the advanced civilization of the &lt;a href="w%3AInca%20Empire"&gt;Incas&lt;/a&gt;. Ayachucho was the site of an 1824 decisive victory against Spanish troops by the South American independence movement headed by &lt;a href="w%3ASim%C3%B3n%20Bol%C3%ADvar"&gt;Simón Bolívar&lt;/a&gt;. The First and Second South American Summits were held at &lt;a href="w%3ABras%C3%ADlia"&gt;Brasília&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; in September 2000 and &lt;a href="w%3AGuayaquil"&gt;Guayaquil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AEcuador"&gt;Ecuador&lt;/a&gt; in July 2002.

The community will include every state in South America with the exception of &lt;a href="w%3AFrench%20Guiana"&gt;French Guiana&lt;/a&gt;, itself a territory of &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3ABolivia"&gt;Bolivia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AColombia"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AEcuador"&gt;Ecuador&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APeru"&gt;Peru&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AVenezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt; join SACN from the Andean Community, a &lt;a href="w%3Atrade%20bloc"&gt;trade bloc&lt;/a&gt; established in 1969. From the more recent (1991) Mercosur comes &lt;a href="w%3AArgentina"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AParaguay"&gt;Paraguay&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AUruguay"&gt;Uruguay&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AGuyana"&gt;Guyana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASuriname"&gt;Suriname&lt;/a&gt;, two small northeastern countries which had previously not participated in a South American trade bloc, will not immediately join the community. &lt;a href="w%3AChile"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt; will additionally join; it has, however, been cautious.

SACN is a more ambitious union than the previous Andean Community and Mercosur. It has been established to be more than a trade union. The "ultimate goal, which can hopefully be reached, in time, is the United States of South America," explains Secretary General of the Andean Community Wagner. A common currency, tariff-free common market, and regional parliament are all proposed in the Cusco declaration.

Many disputes exist between South American nations that may be issues in advancing SACN.

The principal force behind SACN has been Brazil. The First South American Summit was held in Brazil through the efforts of Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso.

Chile has been an associate member of Mercosur since 1996. It was a member of the Andean Community from its inception in 1969, but withdrew six years later when ruled by General Augusto Pinochet. With 70% of its GDP attributed to foreign trade, Chile has traditionally favored relations with the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="w%3AAPEC"&gt;Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation&lt;/a&gt; forum over South American agreements. 

SACN's short-term political and economic effects may be limited. The elimination of all trade tariffs has long been a goal of both the Andean Community and Mercosur, but has had little success.

However, 32 construction projects were approved at the summit. Worth US$4.3bn over five years, the projects focus on improving regional infrastructure. The largest is a US$700m road highway that will link Brazil and Peru across the &lt;a href="w%3AAndes"&gt;Andes mountains&lt;/a&gt;. "These are anchor projects that will be carried out over five years," said Wagner. "They were chosen because they do not serve merely as corridors between countries and zones, but also as a means of promoting development in border regions, which have traditionally been the poorest and most marginalised in our countries." Wagner identifies 350 potential infrastructure projects of a combined cost of US$200bn.

Details of the South American Community of Nations are expected to be planned further at the first First SACN Summit in March or April of 2005 in Brazil. Work on a constitution is expected to begin in 2005. A Second SACN Summit of unspecified date is to be held in Bolivia.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOslo"&gt;OSLO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;mdash; The 2004 &lt;a href="Nobel%20Peace%20Prize"&gt;Nobel Peace Prize&lt;/a&gt; was awarded today to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWangari%20Maathai"&gt;Dr Wangari Maathai&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from &lt;a href="Kenya"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt;. She is the first &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;African&lt;/a&gt; woman to win the Peace prize, and the 12th woman to win the prize since its inception in 1901. The Nobel committee cited "her contribution to sustainable development, democracy and peace" as the reasons for awarding the prize. It is the first Peace prize awarded to an environmentalist.

Dr Maathai is a member of parliament in Kenya, the country's deputy environmental minister, and holds a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APh.D."&gt;Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aanatomy"&gt;anatomy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from the University of Nairobi. For seven years she was the director of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Cross"&gt;Red Cross&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in Kenya, and is most known for founding the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Belt%20Movement"&gt;Green Belt Movement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;mdash; a non-governmental organization dedicated to environmental conservation and protecting forests. Since its founding in 1997, the organization claims to have planted over 30 million trees, in the process employing thousands of women &amp;mdash; offering them empowerment, education and even family planning.

The GBM organises rural women in Kenya to participate in environmentally friendly activities such as reforestation; economically-conducive activities like eco-tourism and training in forestry and food processing; as well as community development. 

On her Green Belt Movement project, Dr Maathai told the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUNESCO"&gt;UNESCO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Courier in 1999, "If you want to save the environment, you should protect the people first, because human beings are part of biological diversity. And if we can't protect our own species, what's the point of protecting tree species?"

In accepting the prize, Dr Maathai said that she was humbled by the recognition and uplifted by the honor of receiving the award, and discussed social and environmental problems that still challenge Africa and the rest of the world. The award includes a cash component of 10 million Swedish Kronor (approximately US$1.4 million). 

Dr Maathai's project was opposed by the Kenyan government during &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20arap%20Moi"&gt;Daniel arap Moi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's rule, and Dr Maathai's demonstrations to protect the forests often met with violent resistance; eventually, she was jailed. 

"The government thinks that by threatening me and bashing me they can silence me," Dr Maathai said. "But I have an elephant's skin and somebody must raise their voice."

In 1997 Dr Maathai ran for president on the Liberal Party of Kenya ticket. In 2002 &amp;mdash; after Moi's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKenya%20African%20National%20Union"&gt;Kenya African National Union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; party lost the presidential race &amp;mdash; she was elected to Parliament, and was appointed deputy minister of environment for the new government the next year, a position she holds today.

VIENNA – 
Doctors from the Rudolfinerhaus clinic in say "there is no doubt" Ukrainian opposition leader was poisoned with .

Yushchenko's body had about 1,000 times more than the normal concentration of the toxin. It is unknown if there were any other poisons in his system.

Although it has not yet been proven that the poisoning was deliberate, doctors suspect it was. "We suspect a cause triggered by a third party," said Michael Zimpfer, head doctor at the Rudolfinerhaus clinic. He suggested the poison may have been administered orally, through food or drink. 

Today's announcements are a follow-up of an earlier press conference, where Dr. Korpan that there were three hypotheses under consideration, one of them involving dioxin. He did not reveal what the other two hypotheses were. Dr. Michael Zimpfer, director of the Rudolfinerhaus clinic emphasized that time there was no proof yet to specify the substance causing the illness. 

Yushchenko left Kiev on Friday (2004-10-12) for further examination in Vienna. 
When Yushchenko fell ill on October 6th, Ukrainian doctors had initially diagnosed food poisoning, leading to speculation that he had been poisoned deliberately. The illness has disfigured Yushchenko's body and face which doctors say could take up to two years to heal.

He fell seriously ill on the September 6th, during his presidential campaign. Yushchenko was taken to the Rudolfinerhaus clinic of Vienna, where he stayed for four days under Dr. Korpan's care. He was diagnosed with "&lt;a href="w%3AAcute%20pancreatitis"&gt;acute pancreatitis&lt;/a&gt;, accompanied by &lt;a href="w%3AInterstitial"&gt;interstitial&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AEdema"&gt;edematous&lt;/a&gt; changes." These symptoms were said to be due to "a serious viral infection and chemical substances which are not normally found in food products" as his campaign officials put it. In laymans terms, he developed an infection in the pancreas and got a bad skin condition that disfigured his face with cysts and lesions. The skin condition has similarities with the &lt;a href="w%3AChloracne"&gt;chloracne&lt;/a&gt; associated with &lt;a href="w%3ADioxin"&gt;dioxin&lt;/a&gt; posioning according to a British toxicologist John Henry.

<h1>Kerik withdraws from nomination</h1>
♡❤♡December 10 2004♡❤♡

&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush's&lt;/a&gt; nominee for Secretary of Homeland Security, &lt;a href="w%3ABernard%20Kerik"&gt;Bernard Kerik&lt;/a&gt;, has declined to continue through Senate confirmation. In a letter to President Bush, Kerik explained that the immigration status of a housekeeper and nanny, as well as nonpayment of income tax on the housekeeper were his reasons for retracting.

However, Kerik's past dealings may have been the strongest reason for his decision to withdraw from the nomination. ♡❤Newsweek♡❤ has uncovered that as recently as 1998, a New Jersey judge had issued an arrest warrant for Kerik following a tangled web of lawsuits relating to unpaid bills on a condominum. ♡❤Newsday♡❤ and the ♡❤Seattle Times♡❤ have reported that Kerik may have business ties to the &lt;a href="w%3AMob"&gt;Mob&lt;/a&gt; and allegations of two extramarital affairs have arisen. 

In addition, his windfall profit from stock options in Taser International (i.e. "&lt;a href="w%3Aelectroshock%20gun"&gt;Taser guns&lt;/a&gt;") with no apparent investment, has been under heavy investigation. Kerik received a profit of more than USD $6 million after selling his stock in early November, just before an &lt;a href="w%3AAmnesty%20International"&gt;Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt; report critical of Taser guns was released. Kerik had joined Taser International's board shortly after resigning as &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New York City's&lt;/a&gt; police commissioner; both the NYPD and Department of Homeland Security have purchased large amounts of Taser's non-lethal electroshock weapons.

&lt;a href="w%3ATaipei"&gt;TAIPEI&lt;/a&gt; – 
Taiwan's &lt;a href="w%3APan-Blue%20Coalition"&gt;opposition parties&lt;/a&gt; defeated the pro-&lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan%20independence"&gt;independence&lt;/a&gt; coalition in the country's &lt;a href="w%3AROC%20legislative%20election%2C%202004"&gt;legislative elections&lt;/a&gt;. The result means President &lt;a href="w%3AChen%20Shui-bian"&gt;Chen Shui-bian&lt;/a&gt; may have trouble pursuing his agenda of distancing &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3Amainland%20China"&gt;mainland China&lt;/a&gt;.

Election officials say the &lt;a href="w%3AKuomintang"&gt;Kuomintang&lt;/a&gt;-led opposition coalition will end up with 114 seats in Taiwan's 225-member &lt;a href="w%3ALegislative%20Yuan"&gt;Legislative Yuan&lt;/a&gt; - one more than it had going into Saturday's vote. The coalition favors stronger ties with mainland and leaving unchanged Taiwan's &lt;a href="w%3Apolitical%20status%20of%20Taiwan"&gt;political status&lt;/a&gt;. The pro-independence coalition led by President Chen Shui-bian's &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Progressive%20Party"&gt;Democratic Progressive Party&lt;/a&gt;, failed again to secure control of the legislature. It captured 101 seats.

The election was seen as a referendum on the president's efforts to distance Taiwan from mainland China and move toward greater separation. Taiwan and mainland China split in 1949 after a &lt;a href="w%3AChinese%20Civil%20War"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt; divided the country. While the &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; was established on the mainland, the Nationalists fled to Taiwan and continued to cling onto the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20of%20China"&gt;Republic of China&lt;/a&gt;. While Taipei moved away from its claim of being the sole legitimate government of China in the 1990s, Beijing continues to consider the island its territory and says Taiwanese independence moves would be considered grounds for war.

President Chen may find it difficult to push forward his key platform issues. They include legislative approval of an $18 billion arms purchase from the United States; renaming state enterprises and foreign offices that bear the name "China" or "Chinese" to bear the name "Taiwan," and a referendum on a new &lt;a href="w%3AConstitution%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;constitution&lt;/a&gt;.

Hsiao Bi-Khim, a member of the president's Democratic Progressive's Party, says those issues are important for his country. "These issues, they're actually reflecting the popular sentiment here and are a pragmatic step forward," said Hsiao Bi-Khim. "It's a process of natural evolution here in Taiwan."

Beijing says the proposals could provoke Chinese intervention but Ms. Hsiao says the president will not push Taiwan toward formal independence. "President Chen has laid out what we will not touch upon, and mainly issues related to sovereignty, independence and national name change, these issues will not be dealt with in the constitutional reform process," she said.

&lt;a href="http%3A//www.asianresearch.org/articles/1705.html"&gt;Washington "does not support" independence for Taiwan. Neither does it categorically oppose it. It does oppose any unilateral changes in the present situation.&lt;/a&gt; Saturday, it appeared that by leaving control of the legislature in the hands of the president's opposition, Taiwan's voters did just that.

LISBON – &lt;a href="w%3APortugal"&gt;Portuguese&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3APedro%20Santana%20Lopes"&gt;Pedro Santana Lopes&lt;/a&gt;, along with his entire cabinet, resigned Saturday after President &lt;a href="w%3AJorge%20Sampaio"&gt;Jorge Sampaio&lt;/a&gt; dissolved the Western European nation's parliament.

The resignations came after Sampaio warned the government that it would be "politically limited" in the run-up to elections scheduled on February 20. Santana Lopes's &lt;a href="w%3ASocial%20Democratic%20Party%20%28Portugal%29"&gt;Social Democrat Party&lt;/a&gt; is severely trailing the &lt;a href="w%3ASocialist%20Party%20%28Portugal%29"&gt;Socialists&lt;/a&gt; in public opinion polls, reports indicate.

After a slew of crises during Santana Lopes's tenure, including poor credit ratings and accusations of media censorship, Sampaio dissolved the parliament on Friday in an attempt to restore credibility to the nation. He then scheduled new elections ahead of the ones already scheduled for 2006.

Washington, DC - US President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; has chosen former &lt;a href="w%3AUtah"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt; governor &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Leavitt"&gt;Mike Leavitt&lt;/a&gt; to succeed the outgoing &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Health%20and%20Human%20Services"&gt;Secretary of Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATommy%20Thompson"&gt;Tommy Thompson&lt;/a&gt;. Leavitt, 53, who took over the &lt;a href="w%3AEnvironmental%20Protection%20Agency"&gt;Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/a&gt; last year, will succeed Tommy Thompson if the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; confirms him. He would oversee implementation of new prescription drug benefits for people on &lt;a href="w%3AMedicare%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Medicare&lt;/a&gt; and Bush's plans to allow religious groups to apply for federal funds to provide treatments for addiction.

Leavitt joined Bush's &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Cabinet"&gt;cabinet&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3A2003"&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt;, and has been called a 'fine executive' by the President. The move comes as the Bush administration is trying to find someone to fill the post of &lt;a href="w%3ASecretary%20of%20Homeland%20Security"&gt;Secretary of Homeland Security&lt;/a&gt;, after nominee &lt;a href="w%3ABernard%20Kerik"&gt;Bernard Kerik&lt;/a&gt; withdrew concerning immigration issues with a former nanny. 

The department oversees Medicare and &lt;a href="w%3AMedicaid"&gt;Medicaid&lt;/a&gt; for senior citizens, the safety of drugs and the nation's food supply through the &lt;a href="w%3AFood%20and%20Drug%20Administration"&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; and it administers the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Institutes%20of%20Health"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ACenters%20for%20Disease%20Control%20and%20Prevention"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.

Thompson is the ninth cabinet member to leave after Bush's re-election, and his departure was not seen as a shock by many &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20DC"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; insiders. Those nine departures mark the largest second-term Cabinet overhaul in more than 30 years. Presidents &lt;a href="w%3ARonald%20Reagan"&gt;Reagan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Clinton"&gt;Clinton&lt;/a&gt; each had seven Cabinet changes for their second terms. The last to have nine was &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Nixon"&gt;Richard Nixon&lt;/a&gt; in 1972. The Senate must confirm all of the nominees. Confirmation hearings have been scheduled for &lt;a href="w%3AMargaret%20Spellings"&gt;Margaret Spellings&lt;/a&gt;, nominated for education secretary, on January 6, and &lt;a href="w%3ACondoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt;, nominated for secretary of state, on January 18-19.

BAGHDAD – 
On the one year anniversary of Saddam Hussein's capture, 13 Iraqis were killed according to AP in a suicide car bomb attack by an al-Qaida-linked terrorist. The attack took place about 9 AM Monday, when many Iraquis were arriving to work, outside the &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Zone"&gt;Green Zone&lt;/a&gt; which is home to the Iraqi interim government and several embassies. The region is under severe protection. 

Authorities said the suicide bomber detonated the car while it was in line at a checkpoint. The explosion was very loud and it could be heard throughout the city.

BOSTON, MA – 
The hotly contested &lt;a href="w%3APuerto%20Rico"&gt;Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt; election for governor has entered the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston to decide whether the &lt;a href="w%3ASupreme%20Court%20of%20Puerto%20Rico"&gt;Puerto Rican Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; or a U.S. District Judge has jurisdiction over the contested ballots.

The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has jurisdiction over Puerto Rico. The election has been contested since November.

The ballot for governor allows Puerto Ricans to vote for a governor of their political party and any one person. The largest instance of this occurred when members of the &lt;a href="w%3APuerto%20Rican%20Independence%20Party"&gt;Independence Party&lt;/a&gt; voted for their candidate (who trailed a distant third) and for Aníbal Acevedo Vilá of the Popular Democratic Party. Opposition mainly from the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Progressive%20Party"&gt;New Progressive Party&lt;/a&gt; argues that the intent of the voter is not clear on these "mixed ballots." The &lt;a href="w%3APopular%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Puerto%20Rico"&gt;Popular Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; points out that such mixed ballots have been accepted in the past.

Pedro Rosselló, &lt;a href="w%3AGovernor%20of%20Puerto%20Rico"&gt;former governor&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Progressive%20Party"&gt;New Progressive Party&lt;/a&gt;, is up for re-election.

The &lt;a href="w%3ASupreme%20Court%20of%20Puerto%20Rico"&gt;Puerto Rican Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; ruled the ballots valid, a decision that was overturned by a U.S. Federal Judge Daniel Domínguez, who ordered ballots be counted but not confirmed until their validity can be decided. The election is a close one, and the validity of the contested ballots will determine the winner.

Time pressure increases with each day, since the inauguration is scheduled for Jan. 2, 2005.

The &lt;a href="w%3APuerto%20Rican%20Independence%20Party"&gt;Independence Party&lt;/a&gt; favours Puerto Rico becoming an independent nation, and is a small third party. The &lt;a href="w%3APopular%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Puerto%20Rico"&gt;Popular Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; currently is the ruling party and favours Puerto Rico to remain a commonwealth. The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Progressive%20Party"&gt;New Progressive Party&lt;/a&gt; favours Puerto Rico becoming the 51st state.

Europe – 
In recent weeks several large European BitTorrent and ed2k link sites have either been closed by the police or have gone offline voluntarily. Sites in France, Netherlands, Finland and Slovenia have been affected. 

On December 14, FIOD-ECD, the Dutch economic crimes police, raided the premises of the hosting provider Mindlab. Servers hosting sites &lt;a href="http%3A//www.releases4u.com"&gt;Releases4u.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http%3A//www.shareconnector.com"&gt;Shareconnector.com&lt;/a&gt; were seized by the police. The reported number of systems seized differs, from 4 (&lt;a href="http%3A//tweakers.net"&gt;tweakers.net&lt;/a&gt;) to 11 (&lt;a href="http%3A//www.theregister.co.uk"&gt;the register&lt;/a&gt;). The raids were initiated by , a Dutch non-government "copyright oversight organization".

BitTorrent link sites distribute torrents, which are computer files with information about a larger, shared file co-ordinated by small servers known as trackers. Unlike predecessors of P2P applications like Napster, this sharing is not centralised on the servers of link site operators, and no illegal files exist on the servers of link site operators. Although such a system has been previously thought to be a legal loophole for file sharers, the recent spate of raids by copyright enforcement authorities apparently proves otherwise.

Prior to raids Mindlab clients Releases4u and ShareConnector were the largest link sites for the ed2k network in the Netherlands. Mindlab had previously refused to remove the servers for Releases4u and ShareConnector, arguing that such link sites were legal in the Netherlands. 

The servers were taken down after a discussion that went nowhere according to Tim Kuik, head of BREIN. "We simply ran of patience," he says.

At the same time, FinReactor, one of the largest link sites in Finland was raided by the Finnish ♡❤National Bureau of Investigation♡❤ (Keskusrikospoliisi, KRP) at the request of Finnish copyright organisations.

On December 19 two large sites, and TorrentBits.org closed without providing an explanation, although these have apparently been voluntary decisions by the operators of the sites. 

Prior to its closure SuprNova.org, based in Slovenia, was generally considered to be the largest BitTorrent link site on the Internet that hosted links to both authorised (e.g. Linux software) and unauthorised files (e.g. Hollywood films). This closure is surprising as it has been generally thought that its location in Slovenia would make it invulnerable to the actions of American-based copyright enforcement groups. 

According to a statement made later on the site by its site's 18 year-old owner, who goes by the nickname Sloncek, and an interview for Slyck, he decided to voluntarily close the links section of the site after the news about arrests of admins of several prominent P2P sites and after receiving legal warnings. 

Although the forums and the IRC network will remain online, SuprNova.org claims that it will no longer hold links to BitTorrent files again. 

At the end of 2004, ♡❤eXeem♡❤, a project to decentralize the BitTorrent link network developed by SuprNova.org, reached a beta stage. 

In a bid to avoid the pitfall of Napster, most other major filesharing networks are decentralized, including Gnutella, Gnutella 2, KaZaA and eDonkey2000. 

The goal of Exceem was to eliminate the need for torrent link sites and trackers by allowing every user to easily publish new files on the network without having to post a torrent file on a centralized server and distribute them without dedicated trackers. The closed beta testing with more than 5,000 users was underway by December. The status of eXeem after the closure of SuprNova.org remains unclear.

TorrentBits.org, another link site was closed at about the same time, the reason of which is still unknown at this time. The site's founder and owner, known by the nickname "Redbeard", remains unavailable for comment. 

Other torrent sites that have reportedly closed are Delirium Vault, Youceff Torrents (closed by French police), Phoenix Torrents (closed voluntarily).

Activities of P2P link sites have not been proved to be illegal and so far no link site was successfully sued by copyright owners. However, police in many countries are often willing to close the sites when they are accused of copyright violations. Confiscating the servers is usually enough to destroy the site, as most of the sites are run by volunteers on a non-profit basis, who are unable and unwilling to fight a prolonged legal battle.

The first large link site to be closed, , was taken down by Swiss police on March 10th, 2004.

Raids have apparently followed a trend of a higher probability of raids when site owners have received donations from file sharers; some believe that this allows authorities to charge operators of such link sites for copyright crime instead of copyright infringement. ShareReactor and ShareConnector were both closed soon after purchasing new server equipment using money donated by their users.

Many people have suspected that the &lt;a href="w%3AMotion%20Picture%20Association%20of%20America"&gt;Motion Picture Association of America&lt;/a&gt; (MPAA), a trade association representing the interests of major movie studios based in the United States, are linked to police actions, although the extent of their involvement is unknown at this stage. The MPAA has taken credit for the closure of FinReactor, although the KRP has officially denied that MPAA had any contacts with Finnish authorities &lt;a href="http%3A//www.itviikko.fi/uutiset/uutinen.asp%3FUutisID%3D65102"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

BitTorrent is a (P2P) file distribution tool written by programmer which was debuted at 2002. BitTorrent allows many people to download one file at fast speeds. It does this by having downloaders swap portions of a file with one another, instead of downloading from a single centralised server or individual. It is particularly suited to quickly distributing new files to a large number of users.

<h1>Man bites dog, charged with animal cruelty</h1>
♡❤♡December 15, 2004♡❤♡

In a rare case of man-bites-dog, a Gainsville, Florida man was arrested on an animal cruelty charge on Saturday after authorities determined that he had been biting his dog as punishment.

The man &amp;mdash; Mount Lee Lacy, age 21 &amp;mdash; told officers that biting was an effective form of punishment. He had most recently used biting in response to his dog defecating in the house. He has not yet posted his $25,000 bail.

&lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;LONDON&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; – The &lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20of%20Lords"&gt;House of Lords&lt;/a&gt;, the UK's highest court, has ruled that detaining foreign &lt;a href="w%3ATerrorist"&gt;terrorist&lt;/a&gt; suspects without trial contravenes &lt;a href="w%3AGreat%20Britain"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AEU"&gt;European&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AHuman%20rights"&gt;human rights&lt;/a&gt; legislation. The appeal, on behalf of nine suspected terrorists, was upheld by the &lt;a href="w%3ALaw%20Lords"&gt;Law Lords&lt;/a&gt; with a vote of eight to one. Despite the ruling, &lt;a href="w%3AHome%20Secretary"&gt;Home Secretary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Clarke"&gt;Charles Clarke&lt;/a&gt;, in his first full day in office, has decided that the terrorists will remain in prison; six of the suspects are being held in &lt;a href="w%3ABelmarsh"&gt;Belmarsh prison&lt;/a&gt;, the other three in &lt;a href="w%3ABroadmoor%20Hospital"&gt;Broadmoor Hospital&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3ASolicitor"&gt;solicitor&lt;/a&gt; representing eight of the suspects has said that she will take the case to the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Court%20of%20Human%20Rights"&gt;European Court of Human Rights&lt;/a&gt; if the men are not released immediately. The &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Democrats%20%28UK%29"&gt;Liberal Democrats&lt;/a&gt; have called on Charles Clarke to stand up to the draconian anti-terror measures enacted by his predecessor, &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Blunkett"&gt;David Blunkett&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href="w%3AAnti-terrorism%2C%20Crime%20and%20Security%20Act%202001"&gt;Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001&lt;/a&gt;. This act was passed in the immediate aftermath of the &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%2C%202001%20attacks"&gt;September 11, 2001 attacks&lt;/a&gt;.

The ruling is the second major blow to &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair's&lt;/a&gt; anti-terrorist legislation in the space of 24 hours following the resignation of his key ally, and architect of much of the legislation, David Blunkett yesterday.

&lt;a href="w%3ABrussels"&gt;BRUSSELS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABelgium"&gt;BELGIUM&lt;/a&gt; – On the first day of a two day &lt;a href="w%3AEU"&gt;EU&lt;/a&gt; summit, a provisional date of &lt;a href="w%3AOctober%203"&gt;October 3&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3A2005"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt; has been set to begin membership talks with &lt;a href="w%3ATurkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;. However, with the large barriers that must be crossed before &lt;a href="w%3AAccession%20of%20Turkey%20to%20the%20European%20Union"&gt;Turkish membership&lt;/a&gt; is accepted the talks could take as long as 15 years, and membership is far from guaranteed.

The first major hurdle is Turkish recognition of &lt;a href="w%3ACyprus"&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt;. EU leaders, including &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Commission"&gt;European Commission President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9%20Manuel%20Dur%C3%A3o%20Barroso"&gt;José Manuel Durão Barroso&lt;/a&gt;, have made recognising the island member-state a key pre-requisite for talks, however, Turkish Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ARecep%20Tayyip%20Erdogan"&gt;Recep Tayyip Erdogan&lt;/a&gt; has previously said that he would not bow to demands to recognise the nation citing this as one of four "red lines" he will not cross. Erdogan has said that recognition is entirely dempendent upon the Greek-Cypriots accepting a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; peace plan to re-unify the island, which previously they rejected.

The other main stumbling block is possible restrictions on Turkish citizens travelling to and working in other EU nations. There are worries amongst many member-states about the possible impact on labour markets of Turkey's 71 million people joining the EU, a population which is expected to hit 80 million by &lt;a href="w%3A2015"&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt; and to pass &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, the EU's current largest member, soon after that.

Should Turkey's application be successful it would extend the boundary of the EU to the borders of &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASyria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. Turkey would also be the first majority &lt;a href="w%3AMuslim"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; nation to join the multi-national organisation.

&lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; – Approximately 100 students gained access to their Higher School Certificate results, before the official release date of Friday 17th December 2004. Police are pursuing the matter.

The access was gained through the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.boardofstudies.nsw.edu.au/"&gt;Board of Studies&lt;/a&gt; website. To read their results, the student required a .zip archive, which was being distributed among students using the Internet. This archive seems to have contained a URL. This URL was either directly to the board of studies site, or to a script/site which allowed as student to enter information then assembled a URL to the board of studies site, allowing students to view their results early.

In perhaps the tie of the round the league leaders of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APremier%20League"&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALiga"&gt;La Liga&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Chelsea%20F.C."&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="FC%20Barcelona"&gt;Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;, have been drawn together.

Here is the complete draw:

&lt;a href="Real%20Madrid"&gt;Real Madrid&lt;/a&gt; v. &lt;a href="Juventus"&gt;Juventus&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFC%20Porto"&gt;FC Porto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; v. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInter%20Milan"&gt;Inter Milan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br&gt;

&lt;a href="Bayern%20Munich"&gt;Bayern Munich&lt;/a&gt; v. &lt;a href="Arsenal%20F.C."&gt;Arsenal&lt;/a&gt;

The teams listed first will play their home game first. The first leg matches will be played on February 22/23, with the return games played on March 8/9. The FC Porto-Inter Milan second leg will be played on March 15 due to UEFA rules saying that a stadium cannot be used to host two games on consecutive days; Inter share their San Siro ground with AC Milan

&lt;a href="w%3AAuckland"&gt;AUCKLAND&lt;/a&gt; – This event saw an emergence of the Pacific Island nations into the Commonwealth Judo community. For many years only &lt;a href="Fiji"&gt;Fiji&lt;/a&gt;'s Nacanieli Takayawa was apparent on the international scene. Although not taking many medals, the efforts going into development in nations such as &lt;a href="Tonga"&gt;Tonga&lt;/a&gt; allowed many of their players to place 5th or 7th. &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; also performed well, especially their women's team.

<h1>International Anti-Smoking Treaty to Take Effect Soon</h1>
♡❤♡18 December 2004♡❤♡

The global war on &lt;a href="w%3Asmoking"&gt;smoking&lt;/a&gt; passed a major milestone on 30 November 2004. On that date, &lt;a href="w%3APeru"&gt;Peru&lt;/a&gt; became the 40th country to ratify an international &lt;a href="w%3Atreaty"&gt;treaty&lt;/a&gt; to reduce smoking, thus triggering activation of the treaty in 90 days.

According to the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organization"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;'s World Health Report 2003, &lt;a href="w%3Atobacco"&gt;tobacco&lt;/a&gt; consumption is the single leading preventable cause of death. It prematurely ends the lives of 5 million people a year, a figure which will double by 2020 if current trends are not reversed. Tobacco is the only legal product that causes the death of one half of its regular users, more than many illegal drugs. This means that of the current 1.3 billion smokers, 650 million people will die prematurely due to tobacco. Another way to look at the effect of smoking is to measure the average reduction in life expectancy among smokers. A &lt;a href="http%3A//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi%3Fcmd%3DRetrieve%26amp%3Bdb%3Dpubmed%26amp%3Bdopt%3DAbstract%26amp%3Blist_uids%3D15213107%26amp%3Bitool%3Diconpmc"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in the British Medical Journal in June 2004 followed 34,439 male doctors since 1951 and showed that smokers died on average 10 years earlier than non-smokers.

Although the number of smokers has stabilized or fallen in developed areas, it is rising in developing or transitional regions, which contain more of the world's population and already 84% of the world's smokers. To fight this increasing health threat, the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (&lt;a href="http%3A//www.who.int/tobacco/framework/en/"&gt;WHO FCTC&lt;/a&gt;) was unanimously adopted by the 56th &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Assembly"&gt;World Health Assembly&lt;/a&gt; in May 2003 following almost three years of negotiations. The treaty aims to reduce both the demand for and the supply of tobacco by setting standards on tobacco price and tax increases, tobacco advertising and sponsorship, labelling, illicit trade and second-hand smoke.

Studies show that increasing prices through taxes on tobacco products is the most cost-effective way to reduce smoking. The &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Bank"&gt;World Bank&lt;/a&gt; estimated that a 10% increase in tobacco prices would, on average, result in a reduction of 4% of the demand in high-income countries and 8% in lower-income countries. Thus the treaty suggests tobacco taxes or price controls, although it neither suggests specific levels nor requires any taxes or price controls.

The treaty requires all countries adopting it to ban, to the extent allowed by their constitutions, all tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship within five years. Health warnings must occupy at least half of the principal display areas of a pack, but they must not be less than 30%. These health warnings must be changed regularly and may include pictures. &lt;a href="w%3Acigarette"&gt;Cigarette&lt;/a&gt; packages must contain information on ingredients and &lt;a href="w%3Aemissions"&gt;emissions&lt;/a&gt;.

The treaty aims to reduce &lt;a href="w%3Asmuggling"&gt;smuggling&lt;/a&gt; by requiring adopting nations to mark all tobacco packages for tracing purposes and to indicate their country of destination, as well as to cooperate with each other in monitoring and controlling the movement of tobacco products and investigating their diversion. The treaty bans tobacco sales to and by &lt;a href="w%3Aminors"&gt;minors&lt;/a&gt;.

The idea for an international instrument for tobacco control was initiated in May 1995 at the 48th World Health Assembly. But it wasn’t until 1999, a year after the then WHO Director-General, &lt;a href="w%3AGro%20Harlem%20Brundtland"&gt;Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland&lt;/a&gt;, made global tobacco control a priority, that work on the present treaty began. During the year after the FCTC was written, 167 countries signed and 23 countries ratified it, making it one of the most rapidly embraced &lt;a href="w%3AUN"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; treaties of all time. "The momentum growing around the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control seems unstoppable. It demonstrates the importance placed by the international community on saving many of the millions of lives now lost to tobacco," said Dr &lt;a href="w%3ALee%20Jong-wook"&gt;Lee Jong-wook&lt;/a&gt;, WHO Director-General. "I look forward to more countries joining the 40 states that are making it possible for this Treaty to become law."

Of the countries ratifying the treaty, the largest are (in order of decreasing population) &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABangladesh"&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ABurma"&gt;Burma&lt;/a&gt;. Nations that have signed but not yet ratified include &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUSA"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APhilippines"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AVietnam"&gt;Viet Nam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AEgypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;. The largest non-signers are &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AColombia"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATanzania"&gt;Tanzania&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AUzbekistan"&gt;Uzbekistan&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="w%3AHimalayas"&gt;Himalayan&lt;/a&gt; kingdom of &lt;a href="w%3ABhutan"&gt;Bhutan&lt;/a&gt; went beyond the treaty requirements when on December 17 it became the first country in the world to completely ban the sale of tobacco.

<h1>The Deadliest Fall</h1>
♡❤♡18 December 2004♡❤♡

Emergency hospital during 1918 influenza epidemic, Camp Funston, Kansas (source: National Museum of Health and Medicine, AFIP).

A bout of the flu can be mild. In young, healthy adults, many infections pass unnoticed. But sometimes the &lt;a href="w%3Ainfluenza"&gt;influenza&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Avirus"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt; evolves into a strain that decimates its victims. The worst known strain swept the world in the Fall of 1918, infecting 500-1000 million and killing 40-100 million, about 2-5% of people.

There are several theories about where the &lt;a href="w%3Apandemic"&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt; began, but the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi%3Fartid%3D340389%26amp%3Bblobtype%3Dpdf"&gt;likeliest origin&lt;/a&gt; was in Haskell County, Kansas, in the United States. People in the sparsely populated county, where farmers raised pigs, poultry, cattle, and grain, began suffering from influenza in late January 1918. Unusually for flu, it was young, healthy adults who were hardest hit. Victims fell ill suddenly, many progressing to &lt;a href="w%3Apneumonia"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt; and dying, often within days. Within weeks, however, the &lt;a href="w%3Aepidemic"&gt;epidemic&lt;/a&gt; ended. The natural geographic isolation of this community normally might have contained the fatal flu in a sort of unintentional &lt;a href="w%3Aquarantine"&gt;quarantine&lt;/a&gt;, but the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20War%20I"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt; intervened. Men were uprooted from their home towns and congregated in huge numbers in army camps for training and then shipping out to other camps or to fight in Europe. The destination for men from Haskell County was Camp Funston, part of Fort Riley, Kansas, where the first influenza case was reported in early March. As soldiers moved among camps, the virus spread. Within two months, the epidemic spread to most of the army camps and most of the largest cities in the United States. As American soldiers went to France, so did the virus, spreading first from the port of Brest.

The flu then spread worldwide. The pandemic reached its height in the Fall of 1918. Spain was affected early, and because Spain was not fighting in the World War, there was no wartime censorship, and news of the outbreak became widely known, leading to the flu being called the Spanish Flu in many countries. In Spain, however, it was called French Flu or the Naples Soldier. In India, about 12 million people died of flu. In some US cities, people died so quickly that morticians couldn't cope with the bodies. According to Jessie Lee Brown Foveaux, who worked in the Fort Riley laundry during the epidemic: "They were piling them up in a warehouse until they could get coffins for them."

The disease started with cough, then headache. Temperature, breathing and heart rate increased rapidly. In the worst cases, pneumonia came next, the lungs filling with liquid, drowning the patients and turning them blue from lack of air. Patients bled from every orifice: mouths, noses, ears, eyes. Those who survived often suffered temporary or permanent brain damage. Several million developed &lt;a href="w%3Aencephalitis%20lethargica"&gt;encephalitis lethargica&lt;/a&gt;, in which victims were trapped in a permanent sleeplike and rigid state, as portrayed in the 1990 movie "&lt;a href="w%3AAwakenings"&gt;Awakenings&lt;/a&gt;." In others, normal thought processes were impaired. During negotiations to end World War I, US President &lt;a href="w%3AWoodrow%20Wilson"&gt;Woodrow Wilson&lt;/a&gt; was struck with flu, and people around him noted that his mental abilities never fully recovered. The French leader &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Clemenceau"&gt;George Clemenceau&lt;/a&gt; had wanted harsher punishment of Germany than Wilson had desired. Clemenceau may have convinced Wilson in his weakened state to accept such harsh terms, which may have been one of the factors causing &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20War%20II"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;.

Since flu is highly contagious early in the illness, even before symptoms appear, strict quarantine may be necessary to stop its spread during an epidemic. Australia kept its 1918 flu death rate relatively low by enforcing quarantines. However, in many parts of the world, public health officials hesitated to impose such measures, giving the disease time to gain a foothold. In the US city of Philadelphia, a rally of half a million people was planned in September 1918 to sell bonds to fund the war, at just the time when the flu started to infect residents. Although doctors warned the public health director to cancel the rally, he wanted to meet the city's quota to raise money for the war and refused to cancel the event. Within days after the rally, half a million city residents caught the flu.

Why was the 1918 flu so deadly? The influenza virus wasn't preserved at the time of the outbreak, at least on purpose. But in the late 1990s researchers Ann Reid, Jeffery K. Taubenberger, and their colleagues extracted and &lt;a href="http%3A//www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/96/4/1651"&gt;sequenced the genetic material&lt;/a&gt; of the virus, &lt;a href="w%3ARNA"&gt;RNA&lt;/a&gt;, from tissue of victims who died in the pandemic. They used bits of lung that were preserved in formalin from victims on army bases or from victims buried in permafrost in the Alaskan village of Brevig Mission, where flu killed 85% of adults. Comparisons with known flu viruses in humans, pigs, and birds suggest that some genes of the 1918 virus came from birds or an unknown animal source. Other scientists then were able to show that the &lt;a href="w%3Aamino%20acid"&gt;amino acid&lt;/a&gt; sequence of &lt;a href="w%3Ahemagglutinin"&gt;hemagglutinin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aprotein"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; from the 1918 virus had several changes from other flu viruses that may have helped it to easily bind and invade human cells, and that made the virus look different enough from earlier flu virus strains that people had no immunity.

The possibility exists that another flu pandemic will sweep the world like the one in 1918. In 2004, an &lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt; influenza virus has killed millions of birds and at least 30 people in southeast Asia. So far this virus strain has not evolved the ability to pass directly from human to human, but that possibility becomes more likely as the &lt;a href="w%3Abird%20flu"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt; pandemic continues and humans remain in contact with chickens, ducks, and other birds. The virus has killed two-thirds of people reported to be infected. Dr. Tim Uyeki, an epidemiologist for the &lt;a href="w%3ACenters%20for%20Disease%20Control"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt;, says, "you have the ingredients in Asia right now for a public health disaster."

But since sequences of this bird flu virus are known, it may be possible to develop a &lt;a href="w%3Avaccine"&gt;vaccine&lt;/a&gt; or set of vaccines to protect against it. At a special meeting of influenza experts on November 11th and 12th, &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organization"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; influenza program chief &lt;a href="w%3AKlaus%20Stohr"&gt;Klaus Stohr&lt;/a&gt; said, "It is not only possible, but also important, that influenza pandemic vaccines be made available... and there's a shared responsibility needed to make that happen…. We have a huge window of opportunity now."

The &lt;a href="Cuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;n government has erected a number of billboards outside the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; interests section in Havana, featuring photos of the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuses as well as the word "fascists" and a red swastika, covered with the text "Made in USA".

The Cuban display was erected in response to the US missions Christmas decorations that feature a large lighted sign with the number 75 on it - the number of Cuban dissidents jailed last year by Cuban government.

Although Cuba made a complaint over the sign and has threatened to take action, the senior US diplomat in Cuba, James Cason, is standing firm by the decision to draw attention to Cuba's human rights offences. The Christmas decorations will remain in place until the end of the holiday season.

The rest of the US display features brightly-lit Santas, snowmen and a large neon pyramid tree, as well as messages wishing the Cubans a Happy Christmas.

<h1>European Union Council to accept software patent directive</h1>
♡❤♡December 22, 2004♡❤♡

The controversial &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; Directive on the Patentability of Computer Implemented Inventions, also called the "software patent directive" has been put to rest for 2004. The directive was expected to easily pass through the European Council's Fisheries Council on Tuesday, December 21, but was removed from the agenda at the request of 
Poland's Minister of Science and Computerisation, Wlodzimierz Marcinski. 

The directive's opponents, some of whom had conceded defeat on Tuesday before the vote was taken, will continue the debate informally until meetings resume in 2005. 

Software developers, who supported the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Parliament"&gt;European Parliament&lt;/a&gt;'s proposal last year to definitively rule out software patents, welcomed the delay as a chance to reintroduce those provisions into the current draft.

Florian Mueller, campaign manager of NoSoftwarePatents.com, which is supported by three IT companies (1&amp;1, Red Hat, and MySQL AB), applauded Poland's move.

"The Polish government deserves greatest admiration for its courage!" said Mueller in a press release. "Now Europe has the opportunity to have a constructive debate on the severe shortcomings of the current Council text, under the new Luxembourgish EU presidency next year." 

Germany's representative also backed the delay, saying it would allow everyone to align the current proposal to changes proposed by the European Parliament last year. 

"We were well aware that [the current proposal] has room for improvement with an eye to the objective of arriving at a consensus position between the EU Council and the European Parliament," Germany's Federal Minister of Justice Brigitte Zypries said in a Tuesday statement. "We will continue to work constructively toward finding a solution that even better meets the needs of those concerned than the decision taken in May of this year."

On May 18, 2004 EU Council reached a political agreement on a "Common Position" on the directive which ignored the European Parliament's vote from last year. The Council vote generated a lot of controversy. Later, the &lt;a href="w%3ANetherlands"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt; parliament failed to convince its EU representatives to reverse their vote. 

According to the new voting weights which took effect on November 1, the majority needed to formally adopt the Common Position (after translations were done) is questionable. The 20 countries that supported the Directive on May 18 fall short of the new qualified majority by 16 votes.

The directive about patentability of computer implemented inventions (the so-called &lt;a href="w%3Asoftware%20patent"&gt;software patent&lt;/a&gt; directive) has appeared in the agenda of today's meeting of the Council of Agriculture and Fisheries Council of the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;EU&lt;/a&gt; as an "A-item" (an item which does not need further discussion).

Everyone following the events expects the directive will pass, despite the vehement opposition of the European &lt;a href="w%3AOpen%20Source"&gt;Open Source&lt;/a&gt; organization and small-to-medium software companies.

Against all expectations, Poland has asked for postponement of the final decision, saying they need a clear text which excludes patentability of software. The Polish Minister of Science and Information Technology, Wlodzimierz Marcinski, travelled to Brussels to tell the Council.

The decision has been welcomed by the opponents of software patents, and condemned by the pro-software-patent lobbies.

With a slim majority, the council voted for the "Common Position" on the May 18th directive.

Since then, most of the countries have received considerable pressure from their citizens and parliaments to reverse the vote. One of the most cited examples is the decision of the Dutch parliament, which urged the Dutch representative (also president of the Council for the second half of 2004) to withdraw their vote. Similar decisions have also been made in Germany, Hungary, Latvia and Poland. However, the result was only some unilateral statements attached to the directive by their respective governments.

It is believed that this decision is a great relief for those governments, as they can now seek a more widely accepted compromise.

Germany has already reacted positively to the event.
Germany's federal minister of justice, Brigitte Zypries, said:

Other sources have estimated the total to be as much as $58m. In what appears to be a meticulously planned operation, the families of two executives were held hostage on Sunday night by armed gunmen. The two executives were made to go to work yesterday as if everything was normal, after closing the bank they opened the vault for a number of robbers who then proceeded to empty the contents into a waiting truck over a two hour period.

The gang members did not hurt anyone, although one of the hostages was taken to hospital with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="wikt%3Ahypothermia"&gt;hypothermia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the circumstances of which have not been explained. Assistant Chief Constable Sam Kinkaid, a police spokesman, said that it is "far too early" to say if the thieves had "any connections to a paramilitary group". 

The money stolen was almost entirely made up of Northern Bank notes which are highly distinctive, and harder to get rid of in large amounts than the more common Bank of England notes. Police are hoping that this fact will help them in finding the gang involved.

<h1>16 Foot Asteroid Passes Between Earth and Satellites</h1>
♡❤♡December 22, 2004♡❤♡

A small asteroid passed just under the orbit of &lt;a href="w%3Ageostationary"&gt;geostationary&lt;/a&gt; satellites (22,300 miles - 36,000 kilometers) Dec. 19. The asteroid, named 2004 YD5, was roughly 16 feet (5 meters) wide. If it had entered Earth's atmosphere, scientists believe it would have most likely exploded before impact.

2004 YD5 approached Earth from the direction of the sun, and as such was impossible to detect before it had passed.

<h1>Mozambique's ruling party retains control in elections</h1>
♡❤♡December 22, 2004♡❤♡

The presidential elections in the Southern African nation &lt;a href="w%3AMozambique"&gt;Mozambique&lt;/a&gt; have resulted in a landslide victory for the ruling &lt;a href="w%3AMozambican%20Liberation%20Front"&gt;Frelimo party&lt;/a&gt;. The party's candidate, &lt;a href="w%3AArmando%20Guebuza"&gt;Armando Guebuza&lt;/a&gt;, was elected to the presidential post for the five-year term starting in 2005 with 63.7% of the vote.

The election was held on December 1 and 2, 2004, and the results were officially announced yesterday by the country's National Elections Committee (CNE). It also announced Frelimo's continued dominance in the parliament. The opposition &lt;a href="w%3AMozambican%20National%20Resistance"&gt;Renamo party&lt;/a&gt; came in second, with its presidential candidate garnering less than half as many votes as Mr. Guebuza. For Frelimo, 2005 will mark the party's 30th year in power &amp;mdash; uninterrupted since the country's independence from &lt;a href="w%3APortugal"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt;.

The election was closely monitored by international observers, who have alleged some amount of fraud. The &lt;a href="w%3ACarter%20Center"&gt;Carter Center&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; an organization providing election monitors &amp;mdash; certain aspects of the election contained irregularities, and the tally counting process could not be verified. However, observers appear to concur that any voting fraud in this election is unlikely to change the result of the presidential elections &amp;mdash; though it could have an effect on the allocation of parliamentary seats. Nevertheless, the opposition Renamo party has announced that it will not take its 90 seats in the parliament because of fraud. The party has one week to appeal the election results.

Mr Rao has been credited for Indian economic reforms during his tenure from 1991 to 1996, and for supporting then finance minister and current Indian prime minister &lt;a href="Manmohan%20Singh"&gt;Manmohan Singh&lt;/a&gt;'s economic reforms, which allowed for the greatest sustained GDP growth in the country's history.

Tampa, Florida – 
Frank Ford, an honorably discharged U.S. veteran sergeant who works as a California state prison guard has reported witnessing torture in Iraq and the cover-up
activities of his commanding officers: December 8, 2004, ♡❤&lt;a href="Veteran%20sergeant%20accounts%20US%20torture%20coverup"&gt;Veteran sergeant accounts US torture coverup&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. Ford says he was hustled out of Iraq for psychological evaluations at military hospitals in Germany and USA as part of an Army cover-up strategy. David DeBatto, who wrote the original article about Frank Ford states that every doctor that evaluated Ford found him to be completely normal, with absolutely no psychological or mental health issues. However according to &lt;a href="http%3A//sec-global.com/services/ctp/vsg/"&gt;VeriSEAL&lt;/a&gt;, which claims to provide independent and no-cost verification of Special Operations Forces personnel backgrounds, the cover-up accusations are being made by a fake SEAL member.

Ford has already made several unsubstantiated claims including being a member of President Nixon's security detail, a medical doctor, a nobleman with a castle in Europe, a Navy SEAL and knowing the exact location of Saddam Hussein and Ali Hassan al-Majid known as "Chemical Ali". Also Ford has said he has saved the life of a soldier in Iraq, but according to the sources familiar with the incident&amp;mdash;doctors and other witness&amp;mdash;his claims were exaggerated and he did nothing more than hold the wounded soldier's IV bag. The name of Ford is listed at the &lt;a href="http%3A//sec-global.com/services/ctp/vsg/list.html"&gt;Identified SEAL Impostors&lt;/a&gt; page from VeriSEAL.

When inquired about some of the Ford's exaggerated stories, David DeBatto said:♡❤Ford IS an inveterate braggart. This is beyond question as far as I am concerned. However, although that trait may make him unpopular with some, it does not make him a liar. Some people seem to have a hard time separating the two.♡❤

According to Ford he attended a discontinued BUD/S program for Navy corpsmen during 1980's as a doctor assigned to a Navy SEAL team. However Navy records do not list Ford among the program graduates. About this DeBatto said: ♡❤he called himself "Doc" when I met him too at Fort Bragg in February 2003. However, I asked him right away if he was an MD or PhD. and he told me no, he was just a medic, but he has always been referred to as "Doc" since becoming a Navy medic over 30 years ago. It just kind of stuck he said. He also said he was in some kind of medical school or internship, which, upon later research, turned out to be true. It ain't Harvard, but it is a legitimate medical school♡❤. Actually Frank Ford is a "Doctor of Naturopathy" by the Clayton School of Natural Healing in Alabama.

According to Col. C. Tsai, a military psychiatrist who examined Ford at the Army Regional Medical Center in Landstuhl, Germany, Tsai had found nothing at all unstable about Ford." Tsai was also interviewed by Speigel Television in Germany on this issue. According to Capitain Vic Artiga, Ford's company commander, who Ford implicates, he was evacuated for "combat stress" behavioal problems.

In a interview to Los Angeles Times reporter, Lt. Col. Timothy J. Ryan, Ford's commander, said: ♡❤all allegations of prisoner abuse in Samarra were investigated immediately and no wrongdoing was ever found♡❤. Lt. Col. Timothy J. Ryan is also implicated by Ford's testimony.

Ford said that Artiga accused him of being "delusional" and gave him "30 seconds to retract or face psychiatric referral". Artiga, who is a police officer in Redwood City as civilian, denied Ford claims:♡❤That's just laughable. In my years as a policeman, I've done hundreds of investigations. I can tell yoou that the investigation we did was as thorough as they come♡❤.

According to Sergeant First Class Michael Marciello, an alleged witness, when Captain Vic Artiga saw an initial psychiatrist's report, Artiga was, "livid". He "stormed" back to the psychiatrist and "browbeat" her to change her report to read that Ford was mentally unstable, and ordered her to have Ford shipped out of the country. Ford was later strapped to a medical gurney and medvac'd out of Iraq. He was initially sent to Kuwait and eventually to Landstuhl, Germany. Ford then underwent psychological evaluation in Germany and also two bases in the United States for approximately 8 months.

The Ford accusation was reported by &lt;a href="http%3A//www.davedebatto.com/"&gt;David DeBatto&lt;/a&gt; and the article can be seen at &lt;a href="http%3A//www.salon.com/news/feature/2004/12/08/coverup/index_np.html"&gt;Salon News&lt;/a&gt;. The case is under investigation.

Houston – 
NASA's Near Earch Object Program Office has recently announced that the asteroid named 2004 MN4, discovered last June, has the highest risk of earth impact to date. In the December 23 annoncement, NASA advised that the 400-meter wide asteroid has a 1 in 300 chance of colliding with earth. As scientists gather more data on 2004 MN4, the probability of collision with earth is expected to decrease.

The level of impact risk is measured in terms of , and the MN4's score was initially 2 out of 10. 2004 MN4 is expected to come closest to the Earth on April 14, 2029.

♡❤♡December 25, 2004♡❤♡

Officials in &lt;a href="w%3AMumbai"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/a&gt;, India, demolished over 6,000 shanties today in a push to eradicate the capital city's slums. In total, 39,000 shanties have been flattened, displacing over 200,000 people, in the city’s biggest-ever demolition drive, which began in early December.

When complete, over 2 million people are expected to be displaced. After wiping out the least desirable shanties, next in line for demolition are the illegal ‘well-off’ shanties and neighborhoods, according to the legal and bureaucratic motions that have been executed toward cleaning up Mumbai's appearance by lowering the dominance of shanties, which make up 62 percent of Mumbai's housing.

"As far as eye can see, there are mounds of wood, tin and tarpaulin, the remains of 6,200 illegal homes, flattened by a heavy excavator running on tank-like tracks and giant motorised claws," the Indian Express reported about today's destruction. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.indianexpress.com/full_story.php%3Fcontent_id%3D61510"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh said that citizens would see a change within six months. "Every chief minister likes to be remembered, and I’m no exception," said Deshmukh, who despite having an empty exchequer, also announced that Rs 31,000 crore will be spent on new roads, sea links and rail lines. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.indianexpress.com/full_story.php%3Fcontent_id%3D61510"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chile – 
Sergio Galvarino Apablaza,aged 54, nicknamed "Comandante Salvador", has been charged by the Chilean judge Hugo Dolmestch for the following crimes: the
kidnapping of Cristian Edwards(son of Agustin Edwards, owner of the newspaper
El Mercurio) and the assassination of Senator Jaime Guzman Errazuriz.

Galvarino Apablaza is the leader of the &lt;a href="w%3AMarxist"&gt;Marxist&lt;/a&gt; group FPMR - Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front. FPMR was founded in 1983 and became the armed wing of the Chilean Communist Party to carry out terrorist attacks against the Chilean militarist government of the dictator &lt;a href="w%3AAugusto%20Pinochet"&gt;Augusto Pinochet&lt;/a&gt;. Its name is a tribute for Manuel Rodriguez Erdoiza, considered a Chilean hero in the war of the independence of Chile against Spain.

After the fall of Pinochet's government and the return to democracy in 1989 in Chile the organization broke up into two factions: the FPMR Party, which gave up the armed fight, and the FPMR-Dissidents, which continued terrorist activities. Some of the FPMR most recent attacks include the explosion of a building in which the American company Flour Daniel has offices (August 1994), an attempted bombing of a Kentucky Fried Chicken in Santiago (September 1993), an explosion near the Chinese Embassy in Santiago (May 1993), and a bombing of a Mormon church in Santiago (December 1992).

Galvarino Apablaza has been arrested in November 29 in Argentina. Chilean authorities request now the expulsion of Apablaza so he can be tried in Chile. Apablaza and some left-wing organizations want Argentina give him political asylum. 

Apablaza is also suspected of participating to the kidnapping of the Brazilian advertising executive Washington Olivetto in 2001, according to Brazilian police authorities.

BAGHDAD – 
According to Defend America, US Department of Defense News website, US
soldiers members of the 256th Brigade Combat Team, the 199th Forward Support Battalion (FSB), with several units from Camp Liberty (18th Military Police Brigade, 16th MP Brigade, 617th MP Brigade, 307th Psychological Operations Battalion, and the Iraqi Highway Patrol) provided medical assistance to Iraq children at an elementary school in Bagdah.

US Major Alan Kabakoff, with the 16th MP Brigade, says humanitarian
missions are very important in winning the war on terror, although you can't see
the importance sometimes: "It's like fire prevention, everyone knows
that it works, it's just hard to prove, unless something bad happens. These
people want the same things that we do, they want safe schools,
safe homes, and safe areas to raise their kids."

Staff Sgt. Jason Escoyne, Co. C, 199th FSB, who examined the children said
that there was nothing seriously wrong with them. 

This effort is part of the US reconstruction of Iraq. Till now according to &lt;a href="http%3A//www.usaid.gov/iraq/"&gt;USAID&lt;/a&gt;, U.S. Agency for International Development, in Iraq 2,405 schools were rehabilitated including the supply of chairs, cabinets, desks, chalkboards and kits for secondary and primary schools, about 8.7 million science and math textbooks have been distributed, 33,000 secondary school teachers have been trainned, high protein biscuits have been distributed to more than 450,000 children and 200,000 nursing and pregnant women, trainning have been provided to 700 physicians and 2,500 primary health care providers, over 3 million children under five have been vaccinated and more than 1.3 million children under five suspected of malnutrition have been examined.

&lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Ocean"&gt;Indian Ocean&lt;/a&gt; - The death toll continues to grow and millions face a homeless life in the new year as coastal communities in south Asia struggle against continued aftershocks and flooding caused by the largest earthquake to strike the planet in more than a generation.

The &lt;a href="w%3AMoment%20magnitude%20scale"&gt;magnitude&lt;/a&gt; 9.0 undersea &lt;a href="w%3Amegathrust%20earthquake"&gt;megathrust&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aearthquake"&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt; struck off the western coast of &lt;a href="w%3ASumatra"&gt;Sumatra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="w%3ADecember%2026"&gt;December 26&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3A2004"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;, at 00:58:50 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt; (or 07:58:50 local time in &lt;a href="w%3AJakarta"&gt;Jakarta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Bangkok"&gt;Bangkok&lt;/a&gt;).

The earthquake was the strongest in the world since the 9.2-magnitude &lt;a href="w%3AGood%20Friday%20Earthquake"&gt;Good Friday Earthquake&lt;/a&gt; which struck &lt;a href="Alaska"&gt;Alaska&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3A1964"&gt;1964&lt;/a&gt;, and the fourth largest since &lt;a href="w%3A1900"&gt;1900&lt;/a&gt;. More than 140,000 deaths&lt;a href="http%3A//www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/asiapcf/12/28/tsunami.deaths/index.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were caused by resulting &lt;a href="w%3Atsunami"&gt;tsunami&lt;/a&gt;, which in &lt;a href="Thailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt; were up to 10 meters (33 feet) tall, and struck within three hours of the initial event.

Multiple tsunamis struck and ravaged coastal regions all over the Indian Ocean, devastating regions including the Indonesian province of &lt;a href="w%3AAceh"&gt;Aceh&lt;/a&gt;, the coast of &lt;a href="Sri%20Lanka"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;, coastal areas of the &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;n state of &lt;a href="Tamil%20Nadu"&gt;Tamil Nadu&lt;/a&gt;, the resort island of &lt;a href="w%3APhuket"&gt;Phuket&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Thailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;, and even as far away as &lt;a href="Somalia"&gt;Somalia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3A1%20E6%20m"&gt;4,100&amp;nbsp;km&lt;/a&gt; (2,500&amp;nbsp;mi) west of the &lt;a href="w%3Aepicenter"&gt;epicenter&lt;/a&gt;.

♡❤While the earthquake and the tsunamis are no longer ongoing (other than aftershocks), the humanitarian and economic crisis generated by the disaster is still ongoing. This report will attempt to cover the crisis as it continues to develop.♡❤

<h2>Damage and casualties</h2>

The &lt;a href="w%3ARichter%20magnitude%20scale"&gt;great&lt;/a&gt; earthquake triggered massive tsunamis (popularly known as "tidal waves"), which struck the coasts of the &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Ocean"&gt;Indian Ocean&lt;/a&gt;. However &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Ocean"&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt; coasts were not affected.

The Aceh province of Indonesia is the most affected. Officials in Sri Lanka estimate the death toll to be over 40,000. Much of the capital Colombo is flooded and high number of casualties are feared in the North East of the country around the town of Trincomalee. The New York Times estimated that at least 2 hours passed from the time of the earthquake before the island was affected. The tragedy has caused at least some Sri Lankans to ask what precautions could have allowed more people to avoid harm.

In India, the islands of Andaman and Nicobar and the southern states of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh are the most affected. The police have said that there are 100 dead in Chennai city alone. Mild tremors were experienced in Chennai, Bangalore and Cochin cities. The Prime Minister of India, Dr. Manmohan Singh has expressed concern over the disaster and said that all directions were given to the different agencies including the Navy for quick relief work. The meteorological department has warned people in coastal areas in southern India to stay away as there are possibilities of more waves due to after-shocks for the next 3 to 4 days.&lt;a href="http%3A//us.rediff.com/news/2004/dec/26quake.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

In addition to the large number of local residents, numerous tourists vacationing during the busy &lt;a href="w%3AChristmas"&gt;Christmas&lt;/a&gt; holiday travel season were among the victims. In a press conference on December 31, &lt;a href="Sweden"&gt;Swedish&lt;/a&gt; prime minister &lt;a href="w%3AG%C3%B6ran%20Persson"&gt;Göran Persson&lt;/a&gt; reported that the number of Swedes that are confirmed dead is 59 and the number of missing Swedes is 3 559. Most of these were on vacation in Thailand, primarily in Khao Lak and Phi Phi Island.

As of December 31, 2004, the death toll is estimated by the United Nations to be up to 150,000. However, water-borne diseases are expected to kill nearly twice as many people.

<h2>Quake characteristics</h2>

The quake was initially reported at magnitude 6.8 but soon upgraded to 8.5, and then 8.9 and finally 9.0. The largest recorded earthquake was the &lt;a href="w%3AGreat%20Chilean%20Earthquake"&gt;Great Chilean Earthquake&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3A1960"&gt;1960&lt;/a&gt;, at magnitude 9.5.

The &lt;a href="w%3Ahypocenter"&gt;hypocenter&lt;/a&gt; was measured at 3.298°N, 95.779°E, some 160 kilometres west of Sumatra, at a depth of 10 &lt;a href="w%3Akilometre"&gt;km&lt;/a&gt; underwater, within the "&lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Ring%20of%20Fire"&gt;Ring of Fire&lt;/a&gt;" zone of frequent earthquakes.

The quake was felt as far away as &lt;a href="w%3ABangladesh"&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMyanmar"&gt;Myanmar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMalaysia"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMaledives"&gt;Maledives&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASingapore"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;.

The earthquake was unusually large in geographical extent. &lt;a href="w%3A1%20E6%20m"&gt;1,125&amp;nbsp;km&lt;/a&gt; (700&amp;nbsp;mi) of &lt;a href="w%3Ageologic%20fault"&gt;faultline&lt;/a&gt; slipped &lt;a href="w%3A1%20E1%20m"&gt;15&amp;nbsp;m&lt;/a&gt; (50&amp;nbsp;ft) along the &lt;a href="w%3Asubduction%20zone"&gt;subduction zone&lt;/a&gt; where the &lt;a href="w%3AIndia%20Plate"&gt;India Plate&lt;/a&gt; dives under the &lt;a href="w%3ABurma%20Plate"&gt;Burma Plate&lt;/a&gt;. This formed a shock wave in the Indian Ocean, creating tsunamis that traveled at up to 800&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="w%3AKilometre%20per%20hour"&gt;km/h&lt;/a&gt; (500&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="w%3AMiles%20per%20hour"&gt;mi/h&lt;/a&gt;). 

Numerous aftershocks of between magnitude 5.7 and 6.1 were reported off the &lt;a href="w%3AAndaman%20Islands"&gt;Andaman Islands&lt;/a&gt; in the following hours. Aftershocks off the &lt;a href="w%3ANicobar%20Islands"&gt;Nicobar Islands&lt;/a&gt; were also reported, including ones of magnitude 7.3 &lt;a href="http%3A//earthquake.usgs.gov/recenteqsww/Quakes/ussmax.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and 6.5 &lt;a href="http%3A//earthquake.usgs.gov/recenteqsww/Quakes/ussmbj.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. (See &lt;a href="http%3A//earthquake.usgs.gov/recenteqsww/Quakes/quakes_all.html"&gt;USGS current earthquake information&lt;/a&gt;.)

Based on one seismic model, some of the smaller islands southwest of Sumatra have moved southwest up to 20 m (66 ft). The northern tip of Sumatra, which is on the Burma Plate as opposed to the southern regions on the Sunda Plate, may also have moved southwest up to 36 m (120 ft). Other models suggest that most of the movement would have been vertical rather than lateral. Further measurement is needed to determine the nature of the actual movement. The massive release of energy and shift in mass also caused the earth to wobble slightly on its axis.
&lt;a href="http%3A//news.yahoo.com/news%3Ftmpl%3Dstory%26amp%3Bu%3D/afp/20041228/wl_asia_afp/asiaquakeusmapshift_041228013319"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

One year ago to this day, over 30,000 Iranians were killed by an earthquake with a 6.6 magnitude. The Indian Ocean Earthquake came just three days after a magnitude 8.1 earthquake in a completely uninhabited region off &lt;a href="w%3AMacquarie%20Island"&gt;Macquarie Island&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href="w%3AAntarctica"&gt;Antarctica&lt;/a&gt;.

Earthquakes above magnitude 9 occur, on average, only about once every twenty years.

<h2>Post-tsunami humanitarian situation</h2>
Large amounts of humanitarian aid are needed due to widespread damage to infrastructure, food and water shortages and economic damage to the fishing and tourism industries. Epidemics are of special concern, as they are highly likely due to the high population density and tropical climate of the affected areas. The United Nations has stated that the largest relief operation in history is underway.

The overwhelming concern of humanitarian and government agencies is to quickly identify and bury the dead before they become a health issue and contribute to the spread of diseases such as &lt;a href="w%3Acholera"&gt;cholera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Adiphtheria"&gt;diphtheria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Adysentery"&gt;dysentery&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Atyphoid"&gt;typhoid&lt;/a&gt; (according to widespread but misguided belief &lt;a href="http%3A//www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0%2C%2C3-1418740%2C00.html"&gt;The Times&lt;/a&gt;). Other high priorities are delivery of medical supplies and personnel to overwhelmed hospitals and clinics, tent shelters and clothing to people who have lost their houses and belongings, and potable water. Many usual sources of water were spoiled either by salt water, broken by the force of the tsunami, or contaminated with bodies of dead people or livestock, requiring water purification equipment or trucking potable water into the affected region.

<h3>Humanitarian assistance</h3>
Governments and humanitarian organisations around the world are scrambling to offer aid and technical help after the quake and &lt;a href="w%3Atsunami"&gt;tsunami&lt;/a&gt;s that killed thousands of people in southern Asia and northwest Africa and caused wide-spread devastation. The &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Bank"&gt;World Bank&lt;/a&gt; estimates the amount of aid needed at &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;USD&lt;/a&gt; 5 billion. &lt;a href="http%3A//news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4127433.stm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Numerous organizations are also asking businesses and individuals to contribute towards relief efforts:

MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA – Members of the Australian public, as well as celebrities and politicians have been fasting in recent weeks in empathy with a large contingent of Iranian asylum seekers. Meanwhile, the Iranian men are understood to be receiving medical treatment, some having broken their fast after more than two weeks of starvation.

Two Melburnians, Juliana Qian and Emily Smith, held a 24-hour fast, including a 12-hour public vigil at the city's central Flinders Street Station on Christmas Day. Seventeen-year-old Ms Qian said, "I want to show my support to the detainees, and to draw attention to their situation. Many Iranians have been detained in Australia for four or five years. There is much evidence to suggest these detainees would be persecuted if deported to Iran."

Senator Andrew Bartlett, of the Australian Democrats Party, fasted for five days earlier in the week, hoping to draw attention to the plight of asylum seekers in the nation's controversial immigration system, which is highly intolerant of what it calls "unauthorised" arrivals. Artist and convenor of Spare Rooms for Refugees, Kate Durham, comedian Corrine Grant, actor and vice-president of Actors for Refugees, Diana Greentree, writer Arnold Zable, and musician Kavisha Mazzella have also fasted. Other Australians continue fasting in a rolling programme of three days each, with the last of these planned to end on New Year's Eve with a vigil outside St Stephen's Cathedral in Brisbane.

Most of the hunger striking detainees have been in high security detention for over four years, with no assigned date for release or repatriation. As many as 27 were starving themselves during this particular episode, and some had sewed their lips. Three others had staged a rooftop protest.

A letter from the hunger striking detainees explains their reasons for fasting, and for some having broken fast. "We ... listened to their plea for us to end the hunger strike and have therefore decided to start eating again on Christmas Day as a sign of our good will and friendship.

"It saddens us that you have chosen to ignore until now all the information about us Arab-Iranians which we and our friends have provided to you, your Minister and her Department. We have demonstrated that our Arab minority suffers disadvantages and persecution in Iran and that, no matter what our individual situation, we all had to flee home because we were striving for more freedom and justice for our people. We are real and genuine refugees.

"It is unconscionable that we are not allowed to submit this information or that DIMIA and the Australian courts should not be permitted to consider it, contrary to other civilized countries. How can we prove our case when the authorities will not acknowledge the independent information we have provided?"

Australia's Department of Immigration Multiculturalism and Indigenous Affairs is notorious for ignoring information provided in support of detainees, while upholding that similarly sourced information proves the detainees claims of asylum are ungrounded. One such case is the Bakhtyari family, being deported over Christmas. Verified documents indicating an Afghan origin for the family are disputed by the Department, while apparently forged documents are held by the department as sufficient to show that the family are natives of Pakistan, hence their current, and ongoing 'repatriation' to that country.

The Department has for a number of years ignored recommendations by the Australian Government's own Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to improve processing conditions for asylum seekers, particularly with respect to the issue of children in detention. Independent organisations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch also have repeatedly condemned the Australian system.

Politicians in the Australian Federal Government express confidence in this system, such as Alexander Downer, Foreign Minister, on the Bakhtiyaris: "If you're found not to be a refugee and you've been falsely claiming to be a refugee you should go back home and they should go back to Pakistan where they came from."

&lt;a href="w%3ANicobar%20Islands"&gt;Nicobar Islands&lt;/a&gt; - A &lt;a href="w%3Amoment%20magnitude%20scale"&gt;magnitude&lt;/a&gt; 7.3 &lt;a href="w%3Aearthquake"&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt; occurred at 04:21 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;Indian&lt;/a&gt; region near &lt;a href="w%3ABangladesh"&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3Aseismologist"&gt;Seismologists&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3AUSGS"&gt;USGS&lt;/a&gt; have indicated that this earthquake is an aftershock of the &lt;a href="Strongest%20earthquake%20in%2040%20years%20hits%20Southeast%20Asia"&gt;9.0 earthquake&lt;/a&gt; which had occurred just a few hours earlier, 305 km (190 miles) distant, in the &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Ocean"&gt;Indian Ocean&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href="w%3ASumatra"&gt;Sumatra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;.

The Bangladesh Meteorological Department issued a statement that the quake had struck &lt;a href="w%3AChittagong"&gt;Chittagong&lt;/a&gt;, a southern port that is the second largest city in Bangladesh.

<h2>Quake characteristics</h2>

The &lt;a href="w%3Ahypocenter"&gt;hypocenter&lt;/a&gt; was measured at 6.901°N, 92.952°E, some 130 kilometres south by southwest of &lt;a href="w%3AMisha"&gt;Misha&lt;/a&gt;, Nicobar Islands, at a depth of 10km (6.2 miles).

<h1>Zambian government launches a new agricultural policy</h1>
♡❤♡December 22, 2004♡❤♡

The government of &lt;a href="w%3AZambia"&gt;Zambia&lt;/a&gt; has launched a new national agricultural policy, according to a report by the Times of Zambia. The newspaper reports that the policy was announced yesterday by the country's Minister of Agriculture &amp; Co-Operatives, Mr. Mundia Sikatana.

At the event marking the launch of the new program, Mr. Sikatana described the policy as addressing the issues of food security, economic growth and poverty reduction. The policy will cover all sectors of agriculture in the nation, and will be implemented by the ministry of Agriculture.

Mr Sikatana went on to say that the policy contained detailed strategies to cover a variety of sectors within the agricultural industry, including livestock, fisheries, irrigation, and agricultural finance. The new policy also continues Zambia's previous policy of prohibiting the import and use of genetically modified foods within the country. This policy is controversial due to areas of poverty within the country, and the smuggling of genetically modified grains into the country earlier this month.

The Zambian government has previously been criticised by some for its annual ban on fishing during December. It is unclear whether this policy, which was widely applauded by environmentalists and implemented to protect sensitive fish stocks, will be affected by the new agricultural policy.

With nearly all votes counted, the opposition candidate in the &lt;a href="w%3AUkraine"&gt;Ukrainian&lt;/a&gt; presidential elections has claimed victory. Unofficial results show &lt;a href="w%3AViktor%20Yushchenko"&gt;Viktor Yushchenko&lt;/a&gt; leading with 52% to the mainly pro-government candidate and current Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AViktor%20Yanukovich"&gt;Viktor Yanukovich&lt;/a&gt;'s 44% &amp;mdash; a difference amounting to roughly 2.2 million votes.

This latest round of voting was to replace the results of the second run-off election held on November 21, 2004. After the November vote, many international observers criticized the vote as fradulent, and some regions saw voter turnout listed in excess of 100%, prompting the opposition &amp;mdash; including Mr. Yushchenko &amp;mdash; to assert that the results were invalid. Supporters of the opposition pursued legal channels, such as appealing to the country's parliament and its Supreme Court, as well as maintained a blocade of key government buildings in an effort to force a new election.

The new results were not, however, accepted by both sides. The government candidate, Mr. Yanukovich, vowed to challenge the outcome in the Supreme Court. "I will never recognize this defeat because the constitution and human rights were violated," he said at a press conference.

Unlike the November results which were nearly universally criticized by Western governments, the outcome of the re-run has been hailed as fair by officials in the United States and the European Union.

♡❤♡December 27, 2004♡❤♡

The &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20State%20Department"&gt;U.S. State Department&lt;/a&gt; issued public travel warnings, advising United States citizens to avoid travelling to areas affected by the recent &lt;a href="Strongest%20earthquake%20in%2040%20years%20hits%20Southeast%20Asia"&gt;Indian Ocean earthquake&lt;/a&gt; and the resulting tsunamis. The announcements cover Indonesia, Sri Lanka, the Maldives and affected areas of Thailand. The warnings are set to expire on January 25, 2005, and urge citizens to postpone all non-essential travel to the regions.

The U.K. &lt;a href="w%3AForeign%20and%20Commonwealth%20Office"&gt;Foreign and Commonwealth Office&lt;/a&gt; also carries Travel Advice notices covering many of the countries hit by the tsunamis, and similarly urges citizens not to travel to the areas unless absolutely necessary.

♡❤♡December 28, 2004♡❤♡

The toll from the &lt;a href="Strongest%20earthquake%20in%2040%20years%20hits%20Southeast%20Asia"&gt;recent earthquake and tsunami disaster&lt;/a&gt; that affected coasts of a dozen Asian and African nations has risen to nearly 60,000 people reported dead. The nations struck by the catastrophe are struggling to bury the bodies of the dead before disease adds to the already high casaulty figures.

Health experts, such as Dr. David Nabarro, head of crisis operations at the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organization"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WHO), are predicting that as many as an additional 60,000 people could perish if disease spreads due to lack of safe drinking water, overcrowding in camps, and potential leaks of deadly toxins from factories affected by the disaster. The &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organization"&gt;WHO&lt;/a&gt; is attempting to focus its relief efforts on saving lives and preventing disease in this ongoing crisis.

NEW LONDON,CT – 
Serial killer Michael Ross appeared before a court today, and told Judge Patrick Clifford that he &lt;a href="http%3A//www.boston.com/news/local/connecticut/articles/2004/12/28/judge_ross_is_competent_to_decide_to_die/"&gt;wanted to die&lt;/a&gt;. If executed, Ross will be the first person &lt;a href="http%3A//www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php%3Fscid%3D11%26amp%3Bdid%3D495"&gt;put to death in Connecticut&lt;/a&gt; in over 40 years.

Ross admitted to killing eight women in Connecticut and New York in the 1980s, and to raping several of them.

The hearing considered whether Ross, who holds a degree in economics from &lt;a href="http%3A//www.cornell.edu/"&gt;Cornell University&lt;/a&gt;, was mentally competent to waive his appeals. Dr. Michael Norko, appointed by the court to examine Ross, testified that Ross is a sexual sadist and is prone to depression. Ross had attempted suicide three times in the past, Norko told the court, but he is not suicidal now. Norko further testifed that Ross is taking medication to control his psychiatric problems.

Norko testified that Ross made a rational decision in electing to waive his appeals, and the court agreed, finding Ross clear headed and well educated.

"This decision is his right to make," Judge Clifford said from the bench.

However, Ross' father and the Connecticut Public Defender's Office have &lt;a href="http%3A//www.nytimes.com/2004/12/28/nyregion/28ross.html"&gt;filed motions in Rockville Superior Court&lt;/a&gt; claiming that Ross suffered from mental delusions at the time of his orignial trial, and that his previous attorneys did a poor job defending him. There is no word when the Rockville court will rule.

Ross is scheduled to die January 26, 2005.

&lt;a href="w%3AChiang%20Fang-liang"&gt;Faina Chiang&lt;/a&gt; (蔣方良; pinyin: Jiǎng Fāngliáng), the Russian-born former First Lady of the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20of%20China"&gt;Republic of China (Taiwan)&lt;/a&gt; and wife of the late President &lt;a href="w%3AChiang%20Ching-kuo"&gt;Chiang Ching-kuo&lt;/a&gt; died on December 15, 2004 of pulmonary and cardiac failure in the Taipei Vetrans Hospitial. She was 88 years old, although using the Chinese system of counting birthdays she was said to be 90.

Her funeral was held on December 27, 2004 at the Taipei Vetrans Hospital with several prominent Taiwanese politicians in attendance including President &lt;a href="w%3AChen%20Shui-bian"&gt;Chen Shui-bian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AKuomintang"&gt;Kuomintang&lt;/a&gt; Chairman &lt;a href="w%3ALien%20Chan"&gt;Lien Chan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3APeople%20First%20Party"&gt;People's First Party&lt;/a&gt; Chairman &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Soong"&gt;James Soong&lt;/a&gt;.

Chiang's casket was draped with a &lt;a href="w%3Aflag%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;Taiwanese Flag&lt;/a&gt; as well as a Kuomintang party flag. 

Chiang's body was cremated and placed in her husband's temporary mausoleum in Taoyuan County. Current plans are to have Chiang Ching-kuo, and his father, &lt;a href="w%3AChiang%20Kai-shek"&gt;Chiang Kai-shek&lt;/a&gt;'s, remains moved from their temporary mausoleums to the &lt;a href="w%3AWuchih%20Mountain%20Military%20Cemetery"&gt;Wuchih Mountain Military Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;. Originally, plans were to keep the two former presidents in the mausoleums until they could be buried on the &lt;a href="w%3Amainland%20China"&gt;Chinese mainland&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href="w%3AChinese%20reunification"&gt;reunification&lt;/a&gt;. However, last year a request made by Chiang Fang-liang was granted to have the remains moved to the Taipei Cemetery, Chiang Fang-liang would also be buried there.

<h1>Security firm identifies United States as world's top spamming country</h1>
♡❤♡December 28, 2004♡❤♡

According to research done by an anti-spam research company &lt;a href="w%3ASophos"&gt;Sophos&lt;/a&gt;, the United States is the point of origin of over 42% of all spam. Trailing are South Korea with 13% and China with 8% of the world's spam. The security firm performed an audit of its &lt;a href="w%3Ahoneypot"&gt;honeypot&lt;/a&gt;s to come up with the figures &amp;mdash; a honeypot is a special system set up to attract spam or spammers in order to gauge spammer activity. 

Such activity is not entirely unexpected. The United States accounts for slightly over 25% of all Internet usage, whereas South Korea and China have about 4% and 11% of the world's Internet users, respectively. Yet these percentages still point to the U.S. as being a disproportionate source for spam.

The Sophos team noted the inefficacy of the &lt;a href="w%3ACAN-SPAM"&gt;CAN-SPAM&lt;/a&gt; act in its report &amp;mdash; the act has been frequently criticized in the technology media as not doing enough to stem the flow of unsolicited commercial and fradulent email, and the new numbers from the research company only serve to further that claim. Indeed, the security company MX Logic reported that while compliance with the CAN-SPAM act continues to grow, the growth is not enough to stem the increasing flow of spam. Analysts blame the increase in spam on spammers' increased use of networks of &lt;a href="w%3Azombie%20computer"&gt;zombies&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; computers that have been hacked into in order to send the bulk email.

&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%2C%20New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;a href="w%3ATime%20Warner%20Cable"&gt;Time Warner Cable&lt;/a&gt; is close to a deal with &lt;a href="w%3ASprint%20Corporation"&gt;Sprint Corp.&lt;/a&gt; to offer &lt;a href="w%3Acell%20phone"&gt;mobile telephone&lt;/a&gt; service under the TimeWarner &lt;a href="w%3Abrand"&gt;brand&lt;/a&gt; to the cabler's 11 million subscribers, according to a report in Wednesday's ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWall%20Street%20Journal"&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

If such a deal is struck, Time Warner will be the first cable company to offer the so-called "quadruple threat" in telecommunications, by offering voice, video, internet and mobile services in a single package.

The ♡❤Journal♡❤ reported that Time Warner would test market the new mobile service in &lt;a href="w%3AKansas%20City%2C%20Missouri"&gt;Kansas City&lt;/a&gt; before the end of March.

Any such deal could strengthen Time Warner's plans to expand its entry into the telephony market. The company said it expects to have 200 thousand voice customers when it closes its 2004 books Friday. As of mid-December, the company said it was adding about 10 thousand new wired voice customers per week.

For voice customers Time Warner is competing with regional telephone monopolies &lt;a href="w%3AVerizon%20Communications"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASBC%20Communications"&gt;SBC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABellSouth"&gt;BellSouth&lt;/a&gt;, which among them control the two largest mobile networks in the United States: &lt;a href="w%3AVerizon%20Wireless"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACingular"&gt;Cingular&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>Tsunami toll passes 80,000 people as relief effort continues</h1>
♡❤♡December 29, 2004♡❤♡

The death toll from the &lt;a href="Strongest%20earthquake%20in%2040%20years%20hits%20Southeast%20Asia"&gt;earthquake and tsunamis&lt;/a&gt; that has hit countries in Asia and Eastern Africa continues to rise, passing 80,000 people according to reports from several news agencies. A spokesman for the &lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Cross"&gt;Red Cross&lt;/a&gt; speculated that the toll could increase to over 100,000 as some of the smaller islands in the Indian Ocean are checked, and a U.N. official said that the death toll might eventually approach 80,000 in Indonesia alone.

The immediate fatalities from the earthquake and resulting tsunamis are but a fraction of the total effect from the disaster. The &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organization"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WHO) estimates that 5 million people lack food, water or basic sanitation necessary for survival. Officials continue to struggle with burying the dead and delivering basic suvival provisions to the population in the coastal and island areas most hit by the disaster.

Columbus, Ohio – 
Voters in &lt;a href="w%3AOhio"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, alleging evidence of voter fraud in the presidential election, subpoenaed several leading Republicans as part of a challenge of the election results. Ohio Republican Secretary of State J. &lt;a href="w%3AKen%20Blackwell"&gt;Kenneth Blackwell&lt;/a&gt;, President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;, Vice-President &lt;a href="Dick%20Cheney"&gt;Dick Cheney&lt;/a&gt; and White House Political Advisor &lt;a href="Karl%20Rove"&gt;Karl Rove&lt;/a&gt; were subpoenaed for depositions December 28th and 29th in a challenge supported by the &lt;a href="w%3AJesse%20Jackson"&gt;Reverend Jesse Jackson&lt;/a&gt;. Blackwell has refused to appear, claiming in a court filing that he is not required to be interviewed since he is a high-ranking public official. The lawyer for the other three officials claims that his clients were not properly served the subpoenas. 

The deposition was part of a lawsuit filed at the &lt;a href="w%3AOhio%20Supreme%20Court"&gt;Ohio Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; challenging the results of the U.S. presidential election in that state. A multi-party recount effort completed on December 28 showed a 300 vote difference between the initial and final tallies, but failed to answer questions about irregularities in the voting process such as shortages of voting machines in minority precincts, problems with electronic voting machines, and statistical improbabilities in reported vote tallies.

In his court filing, Blackwell further called those asking questions about the vote engaging in 'frivolous conduct' and making too many requests of election officials around the state. Republican Blackwell, as Secretary of State, assigns all members, directors and deputy directors of the precinct boards of elections that run the elections in the state. Challengers to the voting process have questioned whether these boards were adequately run as bipartisan operations, suggesting that since the boards owe Blackwell their jobs, this could have established a pattern of problems that favored Bush at Kerry's expense.

&lt;a href="w%3ARio%20de%20Janeiro"&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt; – 
At least 11 people were killed Dec. 26 and 27 in neighborhood gang turf fights between &lt;a href="w%3Adrug%20dealers"&gt;drug dealers&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3Afavelas"&gt;shantytown&lt;/a&gt; "morro da Mineira" (Miner Hill) in the Catumbi neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro, &lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;.

The fight originated when Gilson Ramos da Silva, 21, a.k.a. "Gilson Aritana," a member of the ADA ("Amigos do Bairro") gang led other members into the "morro da Mineira" (Miner Hill) to sell &lt;a href="w%3Adrugs"&gt;drugs&lt;/a&gt;, Ricardo Teixeira Dias, a local police official said.

The region is controlled by rival gang Comando Vermelho (Red Command), which does not approve of other gangs selling drugs in the region. Comando Vermelho members started attacking the rival members of ADA to protect their turf.

On Dec. 26, one man was killed and five others hurt in a gang gunfight with police. There was panic and several residents from the neighborhood could not get into their houses and were forced to seek shelter elsewhere. That afternoon, a burned body was found at Presidente Vargas Ave. near &lt;a href="w%3ABrazilian%20Carnival"&gt;"Sambódromo"&lt;/a&gt; plaza not far from "morro da Mineira".

Police found seven beheaded and burned bodies at "morro da Mineira", in a dump area. The police arrived there after receiving an anonymous tip presumably from a resident of the neighborhood. 

The police believe there are more dead at nearby "morro do Zinco" (Zinc Hill) neighborhood. The morning of Dec. 27, Anderson Santos de Oliveira, 21, was killed by the police in a gunfight. The police said he was carrying a .38 calibre pistol, a 380 pistol and &lt;a href="w%3Amarijuana"&gt;marijuana&lt;/a&gt;. By 4:00 P.M. Luciano da Costa Pinto, 22, had also been killed by police in a different incident where police recovered rifles and drugs.

Indian government issued today a tsunami warning after a new earthquake measuring 5.7 on the Richters scale. Indian citizens fled the area warned. Tsunamis are associated with quakes larger than 7.5 on the Richters scales. It should not be a surprise nothing happened today. The catastrophic quake that caused the fatal tsunamis was measured to 9 on the same scale. 7,000 Indian citizens are confirmed dead after the first quake.

In Thailand, rumours about a new Tsunami is causing panic among the several thousand already injured.

<h1>MN4 2004 asteroid now considered safe</h1>
♡❤♡December 29♡❤♡
&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; - According to &lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="http%3A//neo.jpl.nasa.gov/"&gt;Near Earth Object Program&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3A2004%20MN4"&gt;2004 MN4&lt;/a&gt;'s assessed risk has been corrected downward to zero on the &lt;a href="w%3ATorino%20scale"&gt;Torino scale&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="w%3ATorino%20scale"&gt;Torino scale&lt;/a&gt; is the current method by which astronomers classify the likelihood of an impact with a &lt;a href="w%3Anear-Earth%20object"&gt;near-Earth object&lt;/a&gt;. 

A score of zero means that the possibility of a collision between the asteroid and Earth has been ruled out of consideration. 

&lt;a href="w%3A2004%20MN4"&gt;2004 MN4&lt;/a&gt; was once tentatively estimated as having the highest potential of any asteroid to hit the Earth. Its risk was first calculated as 2 out of 10 on the &lt;a href="w%3ATorino%20scale"&gt;Torino scale&lt;/a&gt;. 

This rank was upgraded to Level 4 Dec. 24, giving it the highest score ever for a &lt;a href="w%3Anear-Earth%20asteroid"&gt;near-Earth asteroid&lt;/a&gt;. It was considered to have a 1 in 37 chance of striking the Earth. 

Upon discovery of previously recorded sightings of the same asteroid, its estimated flight path was corrected and found to miss the Earth entirely, outside of the margin of error. The asteroid will, however, make one of the closest passes of Earth ever seen. 

It will pass close enough to the Earth's for the planet's gravitational field to influence the asteroid's orbital pattern. However, &lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;'s current risk analysis for the asteroid indicates that "no subsequent Earth encounters in the 21st century are of any concern."

Washington, D.C. – House Democrats called for an investigation into possible voting fraud and irregularities during the 2004 U.S. presidential election, according to a Dec. 23 letter from House Representative &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Wu"&gt;David Wu&lt;/a&gt; (D-OR). 

Thousands of citizens have reported experiencing problems casting their votes due to long lines at polling places, malfunctioning voting machines, inexplicable numbers of votes cast, and disenfranchisement in urban areas.

"The integrity of our democracy is at stake. We need to give the American people confidence that each and every vote will be properly counted and that the democratic electoral process is respected," Wu said. "I also understand concerns about the conflict of interest of having an official in charge of running elections in a key state also heading a presidential campaign. I agree that Ohio Secretary of State Blackwell's dual role calls into question any election decision he made that favored Republicans."

Other Congressmen including &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Conyers"&gt;John Conyers&lt;/a&gt; (D-MI), &lt;a href="w%3AJerrold%20Nadler"&gt;Jerrold Nadler&lt;/a&gt; (D-NY), and &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Wexler"&gt;Robert Wexler&lt;/a&gt; (D-FL) voiced similar concerns, and requested an investigation by the (GAO), citing specific cases in Ohio, &lt;a href="w%3AFlorida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Carolina"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;. 

In December, Conyers, the Ranking Democrat on the &lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20Committee%20on%20the%20Judiciary"&gt;House Committee on the Judiciary&lt;/a&gt;, issued a series of letters about voting irregularities to the media, campaign officials, and manufacturers of voting equipment. These letters seek to collect and preserve information regarding the conduct of the election.

The U.S. Government Accountability Office previously reported on voting irregularities in eariler presidential elections. 

A September 14, 2004 GAO report on the 2000 presidential elections detailed changes the DOJ implemented to try to ensure voter access to polls, and the importance of monitoring election-day activities. The report warned that allegations in the 2000 election lacked sufficient specifics to enable the DOJ to perform and adequate investigation and recommended that more precise information be collected regarding voting for the 2004 presidential election.

Olympia, Washington – 
After two machine counts and a manual recount, Secretary of State &lt;a href="w%3ASam%20Reed"&gt;Sam Reed&lt;/a&gt; declared Democrat &lt;a href="w%3AChristine%20Gregoire"&gt;Christine Gregoire&lt;/a&gt; the governor-elect of Washington State.

However, this result was contested by Republican &lt;a href="w%3ADino%20Rossi"&gt;Dino Rossi&lt;/a&gt;, who is asking for a new election.

This election was the closest in state history. In the first count, Dino Rossi won by 261 votes. Under state law, this is considered "too close to call" and a recount is required. After this first recount, Rossi's lead was shortened to 42 votes. Because this was even closer, Gregoire and other Democrats raised approximately $800,000 to hold a statewide manual recount. She won this by only 129 votes, out of a total of 2.8 million.

To ensure fairness and accuracy in the hand recount, teams of Republican and Democratic counters worked together in the counting. They were watched over by observers, who were free to stop the count if they had a question or concern.

Rossi has threatened on several occasions to file a lawsuit in the state Supreme Court. He also has asked Gregoire to agree to a runoff election.

"This ain't golf," Gregoire's spokesman said. "No mulligans allowed here, folks."

Any runoff election would have to be approved by the Legislature, which is controlled by the Democrats.

&lt;a href="w%3AMosul"&gt;Mosul&lt;/a&gt; – With a Friday dump truck car bombing that left a massive crater and many dead, Iraqi insurgents frontally assaulted U.S. troops in Mosul, Iraq. Initial reports showed 25 Iraqis and one U.S. soldier dead. ♡❤(As of this writing, additional information on the bombing was expected.)♡❤

<h2>Sophisticated attack</h2>

Attacking a soldier on patrol close to a U.S. outpost, the insurgents had two bomb vehicles. The first bomb attack was designed to draw out U.S. support troops while the second bomb vehicle in conjunction with mortars and rockets was intended to overrun the American outpost.

As reinforcements arrived, U.S. forces came under automatic weapon and rocket-propelled grenade fire, Staff Sgt. Don Dees, a military spokesman, said.

The Americans suffered approximately 15 U.S. casualties in addition to the dead before U.S. air strikes forced the insurgents to retreat, Lieutenant Colonel Paul Hastings, U.S. military spokesman said.

<h2>Lack of control in Mosul</h2>

Mosul is Iraq's third-largest city and has become a hotbed of insurgent activity in the past several months. The U.S. military has conceded it is not in control of some parts of Mosul and plans to send more troops for the upcoming election scheduled for Jan. 30.

This latest clash comes as the U.S. has begun a new push in the so-called "triangle of death" south of the capital, attempting to secure the region in the lead-up to the elections.

<h1>BitTorrent tracker site sued by movie studios, will mount defense</h1>
♡❤♡December 30, 2004♡❤♡

Loki Torrent, a site that tracks links to &lt;a href="w%3ABitTorrent"&gt;BitTorrent&lt;/a&gt; files, was sued by the motion picture industry for copyright infringement on December 14, 2004, but has decided to mount a legal defense. The site operators have set up a legal defense fund in order to raise the $30,000 per month they estimate will be necessary to cover legal costs. The suit was filed in a U.S. District Court in Texas on behalf of Columbia Pictures &amp;ndash; a major movie studio. The lawsuit is part of the &lt;a href="w%3AMPAA"&gt;MPAA&lt;/a&gt; campaign to crack down on Internet piracy.

The lawsuit did not initially mention the site's operator, Edward Webber &amp;mdash; instead, the suit was filed against a set of people named "John Doe" to be identified at a later point.

Loki Torrent's popularity had increased dramatically in recent days after the prominent BitTorrent site SuprNova.org shut down in a preemptive move to avoid a lawsuit &lt;a href="http%3A//traffic.alexa.com/graph%3Fw%3D640%26amp%3Bamp%3Bh%3D480%26amp%3Bamp%3Br%3D3m%26amp%3Bamp%3By%3Dt%26amp%3Bamp%3Bu%3Dlokitorrent.com/%26amp%3Bamp%3Bu%3Dsuprnova.org"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Mountain View, California – According to &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle"&gt;Google's&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤2004 Year-End Google Zeitgeist♡❤ report, &lt;a href="w%3ALinux"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; scored fifth on a list of most-searched technology terms, beating out all other &lt;a href="w%3Aoperating%20system"&gt;operating system&lt;/a&gt;s. Linux was the No. 4 technology search term on Google in 2002.

This ranking follows a banner year for the community-built operating system. The 2.6 &lt;a href="w%3AKernel%20%28computer%20science%29"&gt;kernel&lt;/a&gt;, deemed the first enterprise-level release of the software, became available for users in 2004 and made significant inroads into the enterprise computing industry. The IDC recently reported a prediction that the worldwide market revenue for Linux will exceed $35 billion by 2008. 

"SCO" was the No. 1 company query for 2004 in Google's report. High-profile lawsuits by &lt;a href="w%3ASCO%20Group"&gt;SCO&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href="w%3AIBM"&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt; and other companies for alleged copyright or patent infringement were filed and dominated Linux news throughout the year.

<h1>Exeem Annonunced To Be Successor Of Suprnova</h1>
♡❤♡December 31, 2004♡❤♡

Yesterday on &lt;a href="http%3A//www.novastream.org"&gt;Novastream&lt;/a&gt;, Sloncek announced officially that the Suprnova index for BitTorrent, a program used to download music, video, and program files, and responsible for approximately one third of all transfers over the internet, will have a successor. Suprnova was voluntarily shut down earlier in the year due to threats made by the MPAA regarding copyright violation.

The program to take the place of Suprnova, "Exeem", is a blending of 'the tracker', the BitTorrent client, and its 'decentralized indexing'. As the program is in a state of testing, its current form is only designed to run on Windows. Although currently undergoing a Beta Test, the program will be released some time in the near future. The program also contains a rating and commenting system that, although basic and primitive, seems to be comparable to that of Suprnova in its quality.

There are also unconfirmed rumours that Sloncek is receiving payment from a third party for participating in the Exeem team's efforts. This raises the question: is Exeem actually related with Suprnova and, in turn, can it be said to be its successor?

U.S. and Canada – With no new competition to speak of, last week's Hollywood fare is set to once again dominate North American Box office receipts over the New Year holiday.

Of the new films opening this weekend, Lions Gate's ♡❤A Love Song for Bobby Long♡❤ will have the widest release, playing in eight theatres in Los Angeles and New York. Other openers include ThinkFilm's ♡❤The Assassination of Richard Nixon♡❤, starring &lt;a href="w%3ASean%20Penn"&gt;Sean Penn&lt;/a&gt; and Sony Pictures Classics ♡❤William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice♡❤ with and &lt;a href="w%3AJeremy%20Irons"&gt;Jeremy Irons&lt;/a&gt;, both of which will be playing in four venues in New York and Los Angeles.

To be considered in wide release, a film must open or play in at least 1,000 theatres throughout the U.S. and Canada. The lack of any new wide release competition Friday almost ensures that the last week's slate of films will benefit at the box office.

The most likely contender for top-money maker is Universal Studios' ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMeet%20the%20Fockers"&gt;Meet the Fockers&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, the sequel to 200's ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMeet%20the%20Parents"&gt;Meet the Parents&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ starring Ben Stiller, Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand. That movie raked in $44.7 million over the Christmas weekend and a total of #108.5 million as of Dec. 29, according to Box Office Mojo.

♡❤Fockers♡❤ is being shown in 3,524 venues over the New Year weekend, six more than last week, making it the second-widest released film for the weekend. Only the Jim Carrey family comedy ♡❤Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events♡❤ with 3,623 venues has a wider release.

<h2>Wide release films for the weekend of Dec. 31</h2>
The following films will be playing in at least 1,000 U.S. and Canada venues:

<h1>NASA: Hopes raised for shuttle flights to resume soon</h1>
♡❤♡December 31, 2004♡❤♡

NASA's hopes of launching a man into space on the shuttle again are one step closer today. The transportation of a new 15-story external fuel tank from the Michoud Assembly Facility near New Orleans today to The Kennedy Space Centre.

NASA plans to spend $612 million repairing the space shuttle system. The main problem that caused the death of seven crew members and the destruction of the Columbia is the reason for the expenditure. All of the money will be spent on the fuel systems. Making a new foam insulation that will not fall off at launch is the reason for the new fuel tank which will not damage the space shuttle, like the Columbia.

There has been no date set as to when the space shuttle will be up and running again but what has to be in the front of NASA's mind is that Russia will start to charge for the use of their rockets to put American astronauts in space.

São Paulo – &lt;a href="w%3AKenya"&gt;Kenyan&lt;/a&gt; distance runners Robert Cheruyiot, 26, and Lydia Cheromei, 27, won the 80th annual International &lt;a href="w%3ARoad%20running"&gt;Race&lt;/a&gt; of São Silvestre (Saint Silvester) in the city of &lt;a href="w%3AS%C3%A3o%20Paulo"&gt;São Paulo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;. Cheruyiot won the men's race for the second time while Cheromei won the women's race for the third time.

The first race of São Silvestre occurred on Dec. 31, 1924. Since then, the race occurs every year always on the last day of the year. The 15 KM (9,321 miles) course is by the streets of the city of São Paulo and the start and the arrival occurs at Paulista Avenue, a famous street. The competition is part of the Official Calendar of the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.iaaf.org/"&gt;International Association of Athletics Federations(IAAF)&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.aims-association.org/"&gt;Association of International Marathons and Road Races(AIMS)&lt;/a&gt;. 

The race name is a homage to &lt;a href="w%3ASilvester%20I"&gt;Saint Silvester&lt;/a&gt;, a catholic saint who died in December 31, 335. Saint Silvester was &lt;a href="w%3Apope"&gt;pope&lt;/a&gt; during years 314 through 335. During his government the Christian religion became the official religion of the Roman Empire under the rule of &lt;a href="w%3AConstantine%20I%20of%20the%20Roman%20Empire"&gt;Constantine the Great&lt;/a&gt;. This event was important for the &lt;a href="w%3AChristian"&gt;Christians&lt;/a&gt; because they have been persecuted by the Roman Empire during 300 years and now they would have freedom to profess their religion without been in risk of been arrested or convicted to death by the government. 

For the 2004 race, the number of participants was about 15 thousand, with 13 thousand men and 2 thousand women. The majority of athletes were from Brazil but others came from other countries including Argentina, Australia, Sweden, the United States, Switzerland, Germany, Chile, Finland, Portugal, Luxemburg, Bolivia, Canada, South Korea, France, England, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Puerto Rico and Uruguay.

The women's race started at 3 p.m.(local time) while the men's race started two hours later.

&lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; members of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; are proposing a bill that would reduce the standard of ethical conduct required of representatives. Currently, the House expects a high level of ethical conduct, beyond the minimum required by law. The proposal, backed by House Speaker &lt;a href="w%3ADennis%20Hastert"&gt;Dennis Hastert&lt;/a&gt; (R-IL), would reduce the expectation to only require the lowest level of conduct. With the new rules, representatives would only be admonished if they actually violate the law.

The current rules were used for the admonishment of Majority Leader &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20DeLay"&gt;Tom DeLay&lt;/a&gt; (R-TX). The committee found issue with the appearance that he had provided legislative favors with the Federal Aviation Administration for political donors in a Texas political dispute, and with improperly offering support for another Republican representative's son in exchange for the lawmaker's vote in a Medicare issue.

Democrats and watchdog groups point out that the loss of ethical rules would be a serious blow to the government. Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, added, "If House Republican leaders are allowed to prevail, they will have gutted the single most important ethics standard in the House and turned House Majority Leader Tom DeLay's multiple ethics transgressions into acceptable conduct for all House members."

The GOP has previously attempted to legislate rules to protect DeLay. In November 2004 the House Republicans proposed a rule change that would allow members indicted by state grand juries to retain their leadership posts, in reaction to a concern that DeLay would be indicted by a Texas grand jury. The jury had indicted three of DeLay's political associates. A number of House Republicans benefitted from an aggressive redistricting in Texas led by DeLay that led to the defeat of 5 democrat incumbents. The indictment rule had been adopted by the House Republicans in 1993 when they were trying to end four decades of Democrat control of the House.

While complaints about the 'miserly' generosity of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush Administration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have surfaced in recent days, donations and actions at the grassroots level have quietly illustrated the concern and sympathy felt by ordinary Americans.

On Monday of this week, Jan Egeland, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUN"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's chief of emergency relief, said that rich nations like the &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; were being "stingy" by making small contributions. Egeland later recanted his statement, adding that America's contributions to &lt;a href="Asia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;'s tsunami relief was "one of the most generous pledges so far."

The Bush administration has pledged $350 million in aid for the relief effort. Critics have been quick to compare this to the $177 million spent every day in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to conduct war in that country. In comparison, there was a $500 million pledge made recently by the government of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Independently of the government, individual Americans have been directly contributing money to aid organizations. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAmazon.com"&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; placed a link for the American &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Cross"&gt;Red Cross&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , collecting more than $8 million from 100,000 people as of Friday, December 31st. 12,000 donors have donated over $1.2 million to the Red Cross through &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AYahoo.com"&gt;Yahoo.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Scores of International aid organizations are accepting donations for helping victims of the earthquake and tsunami. Many major companies including &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AApple%20Computer"&gt;Apple Computer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACisco%20Systems"&gt;Cisco&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEBay"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="America%20Online"&gt;AOL&lt;/a&gt; are helping enable donations through the web.

The future of the artsy &lt;a href="w%3ATrio%20channel"&gt;Trio&lt;/a&gt; channel became increasingly grim Saturday as satellite TV giant &lt;a href="w%3ADirecTV"&gt;DirecTV&lt;/a&gt; dropped the fledgling network from its national channel lineup.

When DirectTV programmers threw the off switch at 6 a.m. eastern standard time Jan. 1, Trio, an &lt;a href="w%3ANBC%20Universal"&gt;NBC Universal&lt;/a&gt;-owned cable television channel, lost two-thirds of its 20 million household subscribers. The channel's remaining 8 million subscribers may not give it enough audience to ensure its survival, according to some experts.

The network received critical acclaim for a quirky lineup that includes the series, ♡❤Brilliant But Cancelled,♡❤ which took American broadcast networks, including parent NBC, to task for cancelling quality programs.

<h4>Canadian roots</h4>

Trio originally got its start in the 1980s as a Canadian cable channel owned by the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation"&gt;CBC&lt;/a&gt;. Its original slate was described as "a general entertainment channel that features the most successful contemporary dramas, documentaries and films from Canada, the UK and Australia. For the last six years, TRIO has been the largest exporter of Canadian TV programs to the US with over 3,000 hours of content," according to CBC press releases.

The channel's Canadian roots were cut in 2000 when media mogul &lt;a href="w%3ABarry%20Diller"&gt;Barry Diller&lt;/a&gt; snapped up Trio and sister channel &lt;a href="w%3ANewsworld%20International"&gt;News World International&lt;/a&gt; from the CBC and partner Power Corp. for $155 million in cash. Diller saw the channel as a cheap consolation prize after he was outbid by &lt;a href="w%3ANBC"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href="w%3ABravo%20%28television%20network%29"&gt;Bravo&lt;/a&gt; cable network earlier that year. Within months, Diller rebranded Trio, dumped the Canadian dramas and geared it more toward edgier pop culture programming.

<h4>Corporate shuffle</h4>

Over the next couple of years, Trio changed hands twice. First to Vivendi Universal, then to NBC in a package deal that landed the American TV network a movie studio and the USA and SCI FI cable networks. Trio was seen as more of an afterthought at the time.

In a hint of what may be the fate of the channel, NBC Universal moved most of Trio's executive and programming staff over to Bravo, a now-sibling network, which is seen in 80 million U.S. homes. Some experts predict that Trio will eventually be folded with its more successful programming ported over to Bravo.

"Trio was a refreshing oasis on the dial, with a quirky pop-culture attitude that showed in its programming. Trio leaving is kind of like having a witty friend move out of town," Gael Fashingbauer Cooper, MSNBC television critic said in her weekly column. "It'll be missed."

NBC Universal has not commented publicly on the long-term future or specific plans for Trio channel besides to say it was committed to programming the network for current subscribers as the conglomerate re-evaluates its digital cable strategy.

The National Archives of Australia have, as part of their standard
document release cycle, released thirty year old documents from the
Whitlam government.

The centre piece of the 1974 archives are a series of documents from
the Australian Cabinet and the Treasury pertaining to the attempt to
obtain a $US4 billion loan by the Whitlam government from the Middle
East. The obtaining of these loans and the scandal generated became
collectively known as the "Loans Affair," and contributed
significantly towards the dismissal of the Whitlam government by Sir
John Kerr the following year.

The documents from Treasury, which include descriptions of both the
loan itself and the people involved in arranging them, are scathing.
The "Points that might be made" document of December 13, 1974 clearly
states that Treasury believed the distinct possibility that the loans
might be part of "a confidence trick of major proportions". Minutes
from another meeting five days later state the "incredulity" on the
part of the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York
regarding the viability of the loan.

Those documents now available comprise the beginning of the Loans
Affair, from the initial offers to the end of 1974. The remainder of
the Loans Affair documents, as well as everything else from 1975 will
be released on January 1, 2006.

&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%2C%20New%20York"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; – Actor &lt;a href="http%3A//www.imdb.com/name/nm0001583/"&gt;Jerry Orbach&lt;/a&gt; died in his home in Manhattan at age 69. Orbach was a staple of American cinema, stage and television, with his most recent role being in the NBC police drama "Law and Order." 

Orbach is survived by his wife of 25 years, Elaine Cancilla, and his two sons Anthony and Christopher. 

<h3>Biography</h3>

Orbach was born in the tough Bronx borough of New York City in 1935 to a family of entertainers. His father Leon Orbach was an &lt;a href="w%3AVaudeville"&gt;vaudeville&lt;/a&gt; actor and his mother Emily Orbach was a radio singer and greeting card writer. 

The family moved often to keep up with travelling Vaudeville acts, but eventually settled in Waukegan Illinois where Orbach played football at the local high school. After graduation, Orbach got a summer job at the Chevy Chase Country Club in Wheeling doing odd jobs ranging from stagecraft to small acting parts in plays. 

He then studied drama at the University of Illinois before transferring to Northwestern where he studied the &lt;a href="w%3AStanislavsky"&gt;Stanislavsky&lt;/a&gt; Method of drama acting. In 1955, Orbach dropped out of college and moved to New York City where he got a job as an understudy in &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Threepenny%20Opera"&gt;The Threepenny Opera&lt;/a&gt;. 

Orbach continued to work in theater, eventually earning roles in broadway musicals, but by 1961 had grown dissatisfied with being typecast as a musical actor. He tried briefly to break into film without success, and eventually returned to broadway where he earned numerous accolades for his roles in such musicals as "&lt;a href="w%3AGuys%20and%20Dolls"&gt;Guys and Dolls&lt;/a&gt;" and "&lt;a href="w%3AChicago%20%28musical%29"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;". 

Orbach finally broke into television in the 1980s as a recurring character in shows such as the mystery-drama "&lt;a href="w%3AMurder%20She%20Wrote"&gt;Murder She Wrote&lt;/a&gt;" and the hit sitcom "&lt;a href="w%3AGolden%20Girls"&gt;Golden Girls&lt;/a&gt;". 

He earned the lead role as the title character in his own short-lived series "The Law and Harry McGraw", a spinoff of "Murder She Wrote". Orbach also scored key roles in a few Hollywood films, including the action thriller "F/X", and the dance-musical hit "Dirty Dancing", but continued to find his mainstay in television crime dramas. 

In 1990, he picked up a role in the new NBC crime drama "Law and Order" as the acerbic-witted Lennie Briscoe, a role which soon become a regular job. Orbach continued in this role in addition to movie roles and occasional musical appearances until his death this last week. 

<h3>Battle with Cancer</h3>

Orbach was diagnosed with &lt;a href="w%3AProstate%20Cancer"&gt;Prostate cancer&lt;/a&gt; in Spring of 2004, a fact he kept private until November when he checked into New York's &lt;a href="http%3A//www.mskcc.org/"&gt;Memorial Sloan-Ketting Cancer Center&lt;/a&gt; for treatment. In spite of the aggressive nature of the treatment, he died on the evening of December 28.

In an abrupt about-face, the world's wealthiest nations have begun pouring funding into the Earthquake/Tsunami damaged region. Promised funds have doubled in the past 24 hours, to nearly 2 Billion &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;U.S. dollars&lt;/a&gt; (USD).

<h2>&lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; tops the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt;</h2>

After the U.S. increased it's funding donation to 350 million USD, Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi announced a half-billion dollar donation on Saturday, Jan. 1. &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; has promised 60.5 million USD, after Japan and the U.S., the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="w%3ASweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; for largest single-nation donation.
&lt;a href="w%3ANorway"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt; increased it's funding donation to 180 million USD

<h2>&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;U.N.&lt;/a&gt; warns of delays</h2>

Despite the encouraging promises, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Indonesia chief, Michael Elmquist, warned that logistics of securing the funds, purchasing supplies and shipping them to stricken regions will take time, possibly weeks. In the meantime, the confirmed death toll will continue to climb, as may deaths due to dehydration, disease, and starvation.

Newly revealed documents from the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; government have revealed that &lt;a href="w%3AUganda"&gt;Ugandan&lt;/a&gt; dictator &lt;a href="w%3AIdi%20Amin"&gt;Idi Amin&lt;/a&gt; offered his services as a mediator and peacebroker during the 1970s in &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Ireland"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt;.

Amin, who is infamous for his brutal regime in Uganda, which was responsible for the death of hundreds of thousands of Ugandans, and the complete expulsion of the country's Asian community, wrote in a message to the British government: "I hold a strong view that we in Uganda, being a former colony of Britain, stand a good chance of mediating between the opposing sides in the crisis that is tearing Northern Ireland apart". Amin, presumably under the assumption that he could become an influential figure on the world stage, continued to say "This serious and regrettable development calls for Britain's best and sincere friends to come to her assistance."

According to the documents released by the British &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Archives%20%28UK%29"&gt;National Archives&lt;/a&gt;, Amin's offer was met with a mixture of bemusement and laughter, and a carefully worded reply was sent inviting Amin to mind his own business. In a covering note to the original message, the British &lt;a href="w%3AHigh%20Commissioner"&gt;High Commissioner&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AKampala"&gt;Kampala&lt;/a&gt; showed that while the offer showed Amin's "naïve view of world affairs", it was probably "a genuine and sincere effort to be helpful".

Amin was eventually toppled in 1979 by Ugandan dissidents, and the &lt;a href="w%3ATanzania"&gt;Tanzanian&lt;/a&gt; army. He died in 2003 in &lt;a href="w%3ASaudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt;.

Topeka, Kansas – 

The Westboro Baptist Church (WBC), known for its radical anti-homosexual statements, has founded a website following the &lt;a href="2004%20Indian%20Ocean%20Tsunami"&gt;Asian Tsunami disaster&lt;/a&gt; targeting &lt;a href="w%3ASweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;. It is the most recent in a string of websites formed by his followers, including ones against &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, and their original website, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.godhatesfags.com"&gt;godhatesfags.com&lt;/a&gt;, campaigning against &lt;a href="w%3AHomosexuality"&gt;homosexuals&lt;/a&gt;.

The anti-Swede website &amp;mdash; &lt;a href="http%3A//www.godhatessweden.com"&gt;godhatessweden.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; proclaims "thank God for 5,000 dead Swedes" and indicates that the church members "pray for all 20,000 Swedes missing in the Tsunami's wake to be declared dead." The website also links to a recording of a recent sermon by Reverend Phelps and a flyer containing the church's official position. The flyer is a caricature of a devil with small signs declaring that Sweden is a "Homo-fascist state" and a "damned land of ... &lt;a href="w%3ASodomy"&gt;Sodomites&lt;/a&gt;".

The WBC's outcries against Sweden seem to stem from the arrest of Pastor Ake Green by Swedish authorities for describing homosexuals as "a horrible cancerous tumour in the body of society". 

The &lt;a href="w%3AWestboro%20Baptist%20Church%20%28Topeka%29"&gt;Westboro Baptist Church&lt;/a&gt;, founded in 1955 by &lt;a href="w%3AFred%20Phelps"&gt;Fred Phelps&lt;/a&gt;, is known for its continuous series of protests and for picketing the funerals of homosexuals, &lt;a href="w%3AAIDS"&gt;w:AIDS&lt;/a&gt; victims, and &lt;a href="w%3AGay%20rights"&gt;gay rights&lt;/a&gt; activists. Other than the Asian Tsunami disaster, the group has, in the past, declared the September 11th attacks on the United States and the Columbia Space Shuttle disaster are messages from God warning of His wrath to come against homosexuals, whom he refers to as &lt;a href="w%3AFag"&gt;'fags'&lt;/a&gt; on account of the fact that, like a faggot of wood, they "fuel God's wrath".

In the FAQ of their main website, GodHatesFags.com, Rev. Phelps expresses his followers' opinions of the Tsunami disaster:

♡❤"The tsunami was an adumbration of the wrath of God, a harbinger of things to come: that Great Day of Judgment... those Asian countries weren’t the only ones affected by the tsunami. Do you realize that among the dead and missing are 3,500 Swedes and over 3,000 Americans? Sweden, who recently jailed a Gospel preacher for a month because he preached Bible verses and sentiments about the abomination that is the homosexual lifestyle from his own pulpit to his own congregation. America, who is awash in diseased fag feces &amp; semen, and is an apostate land of the sodomite damned. And you wonder if this is the wrath of God?"♡❤

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; (UN) emergency relief coordinator &lt;a href="w%3AJan%20Egeland"&gt;Jan Egeland&lt;/a&gt; has said that he is increasingly optimistic about the relief efforts under way in tsunami-stricken countries. However, he cautions that there are still major problems getting aid to the &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;n province of Aceh. The &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC's&lt;/a&gt; Rachel Harvey, stationed in provincial capital Banda Aceh, reports that the area has been completely cut off for a week. He also said that logistical bottle necks that hampered speedy delivery of aid were improving, with new coordination centers set up in Aceh, near the epicenter of the earthquake, and &lt;a href="w%3AJakarta"&gt;Jakarta&lt;/a&gt;. Regional officials warn that despite improvements, some places may not receive aid for up to two weeks.

United States helicopters, based on a US aircraft carrier stationed off the coast of western Aceh, have begun dropping food and supplies into isolated parts of Aceh province. About 12 &lt;a href="w%3ASH-60%20Seahawk"&gt;Seahawk&lt;/a&gt; helicopters are involved in the operation. "We are relying on the helicopter system because that is the only way we can reach the most remote areas," said Michael Elmquist, head of the UN disaster relief operation in Indonesia. According to the World Food Programme, some helicopters are unable to touch down because mobs of people run towards them for help. Supplies are often thrown out of the helicopters to the crowd below.

Republicans and lobbyists close to President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; have reported that the White House will propose changing the formula for establishing initial Social Security benefit levels in order to cut guaranteed expenditures on future retirees, according to today's ♡❤Washington Post♡❤. The Social Security Administration would no longer use the increase in wages over a worker’s lifetime to calculate retirees’ first-year benefits but would use inflation rates instead. The new “price indexing” formula will reduce individual benefits and overall Social Security outlays because the inflation rate typically is much lower than the rise in wages. The full impact of the change will be felt in the middle of the century.

The Bush Administration proposal, which will be offered to Congress in February or March 2005, is part of an overall Social Security reform package that also would create “personal investment accounts” into which individual taxpayers could divert part of their payroll taxes. The White House believes that the shortfall in benefits created by the adoption of price indexing would be made up by capital gains from the stocks and bonds held by individual taxpayers in their personal investment accounts. 

The move is akin to the private sector's migration from defined benefit retirement plans to defined contribution benefit plans such as 401(k)s as almost half of a worker’s benefits will not be guaranteed by the year 2075. President Bush will support the move to price indexing for calculating initial benefits by pointing out that it was the approach recommended by his 2001 Commission to Strengthen Social Security.

Benefits currently are calculated by averaging a worker’s earnings in their 35 highest-paid years and adjusting earnings to factor in cost of living standards at the worker’s retirement age. Under the Bush proposal, rather than adjusting benefits on the basis of earnings growth, the calculation would be based on the increase in the consumer price index over those years.

The implementation of "price indexing" would cut future Social Security costs by trillions of dollars. However, the cuts in guaranteed benefits for middle-class and some high-income workers would be substantial: 9.9% for workers retiring in 2022, over 25% for workers retiring in 2042, and 46% for workers retiring in 2075.

Opponents of the price-indexing proposal point out that inflation-based calculations of benefits, by linking benefits to prices but not wage levels, would cut retirees out from future increases in living standards since it is wages and not prices that determine standards of living. While American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) Policy Director John Rother concedes that many of the arguments of opponents are valid, price indexing is inevitable and must be viewed in the context of President Bush’s total reform package. 

Rother points out that Social Security benefits, which currently equal 42 percent of the earnings of an average worker retiring at age 65, would be reduced to 20% of pre-retirement earnings for future retirees, thus potentially freezing retirees into today’s standard of living. However, Rother says that price indexing has to be linked to Bush’s private investment accounts as income from the accounts give retirees the chance to make up the shortfalls.

Mark Cuban, the billionaire owner of the National Basketball Association's Dallas Mavericks, has asked U.S. President George W. Bush to cancel the inauguration parties that are planned in his honor and redirect the cost to aid for Tsunami victims. 

"It’s up to President Bush to set an example," Cuban said in his web &lt;a href="w%3ABlog"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;. "Could there be anything more confusing and shocking than to read that our country was offering $35m in aid to the areas affected by the tsunamis, but that the cost of inauguration parties would be about $40m?"

"Does anyone else think that this is wrong?" he said.

The U.S. administration has since raised its aid pledge to $350 million, and sent a contingent of up to 1,200 Marines along with a carrier group to provide assistance to the affected areas.

But many reader comments posted to Cuban's blog agree with him and say that the United States is still not doing enough to help. Other bloggers have accused Cuban of politicizing the Tsunami disaster relief efforts.

Rex Hammock, publisher of &lt;a href="http%3A//www.rexblog.com"&gt;Rexblog.com&lt;/a&gt;, wrote that Cuban's statement is unfairly political and takes focus away from the victims.

"Why not call for the cancellation of the NBA season and take all the dollars advertisers have committed for broadcasting it and send those funds to tsunami relief?" Hammock said. "What, the advertisers won't do that? Have you asked?"

Various sources have indicated that as of today no significant international aid has arrived in the island of Nias -- a small volcanic island off the coast (North Sumatra province, Indonesia) -- a full ten days after the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake occurred. These observations were noted by former Indonesian central parliament member Firman Jaya Daeli, activists from Howu-howu (a Dutch NGO), and Surf Aid International.

Most international aid in Indonesia has been focused on the province of Naggroe Aceh Darussalam (Aceh), as it is where the biggest number of dead has been reported.

There has also been other reports from local media that the island of &lt;a href="w%3ASimeulue"&gt;Simeulue&lt;/a&gt; is suffering similar fate.

Although the number of dead in these two islands is relatively small compared to other areas, the number of people left homeless is far from insignificant. In Simeulue of the 15 000 households 7 500 have permanently lost their homes. The number of destroyed houses in Nias is estimated at 4 500. Infrastructure damage, leading to slow distribution of food aid, has lead to the very real possibility of widespread starvation.

Early reports of the situation in Nais suggested the islands were "submerged" and "obliterated" &lt;a href="http%3A//www.globalsurfnews.com/news.asp%3FId_news%3D15259"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, however these stories were later suggested to have been greatly exaggerated &lt;a href="http%3A//www.thejakartapost.com/detaillatestnews.asp%3Ffileid%3D20041229194206%26amp%3Birec%3D0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, fortunately most of the islands estimated 600,000 inhabitants were spared loss of life. The estimated death toll is over 100. Eleven members of a Taiwanese medical team arrived on Nias on December 31 &lt;a href="http%3A//english.www.gov.tw/index.jsp%3Faction%3Dcna%26amp%3Bcnaid%3D5724"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; most of whom relocated to Aceh due to more pressing need.

The island is popular with surfers who have mounted a considerable grassroots campaign to provide aid to the island (see links below).

Communication to and from the isolated island proves to be difficult.

HONDURAS – Two unidentified young women were found bound and strangled along the road between Villanueva and the village of Santiago in Honduras. A message threatening the same fate to the followers of Porfirio "Pepe" Lobo, the presidential candidate representing the National Party, was discovered with the women's bodies.

Lobo, who is the head of Congress, advocates the return of the death penalty in Honduras. Lobo's support for the death penalty and strong anti-crime views have provoked hostility and violence from Honduran street gangs, known as maras (ants). The two slain women are only the latest in a series of politically motivated violence. A number of people have been discovered cut into pieces with messages against Pepe Lobo, and against the nationalist government of Ricardo Maduro. On the evening of December 23rd, 28 people were killed on a bus near San Pedro Sula.

The government has responded to the recent violence by establishing a strong military presence in San Pedro Sula and the Honduran capital Tegucigalpa.

&lt;a href="w%3AIMF"&gt;The International Monetary Fund&lt;/a&gt; (IMF) Managing Director &lt;a href="w%3ARodrigo%20Rato"&gt;Rodrigo Rato&lt;/a&gt; offered special relief funds for the countries victim of the tsunami disaster. The money is, however, in the form of a loan. The IMF has been present in the area on various occasions. 

The IMF offered a one billion U.S. dollar loan. The money would be given as &lt;a href="http%3A//www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/conflict.htm"&gt;Emergency Natural Disaster Assistance facility&lt;/a&gt;, and would be repaid ♡❤in full and with interests♡❤ within 3¼ to 5 years. 

The money could help the area tremendously, but since it is a loan as opposed to an outright donation, it may not be as helpful. The loan, some fear, may not lead to economic stability in the long run. Despite the possible long term effects, the governments of the tsunami torn nations may simply have no choice but to accept the offer.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; – The &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n Government has said in response to &lt;a href="w%3A2004%20Indian%20Ocean%20earthquake"&gt;the recent tsunami tragedy&lt;/a&gt; that it may take &lt;a href="w%3ASri%20Lanka"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;ns as humanitarian refugees. Sri Lankans already in the Australian community, however, are being overlooked, according to Ian Rintoul of the Refugee Action Coalition. The government issued hundreds of Sri Lankans their deportation orders on Christmas Eve, and similar conditions affect people from &lt;a href="w%3AAceh"&gt;Aceh&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;, near the epicenter of the quake.

The Australian Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) said it has had a special hotline running since December 30 in response to the tsunami disaster. 

"People who usually live in an area that has been directly affected by the tsunamis and may wish to temporarily extend their stay in Australia should contact the Department on the hotline on 1300&amp;nbsp;735&amp;nbsp;683," a Department spokesperson said.

Former Chilean dictator &lt;a href="w%3AAugusto%20Pinochet"&gt;Augusto Pinochet&lt;/a&gt; was officially placed under house arrest a day after the country's Supreme Court upheld his indictment of one count of murder and nine counts of kidnapping. 

Court officials say the arrest order was delivered to Gen. Pinochet's home near the capital, Santiago, Wednesday. The 89-year-old retired general has been at his home recovering from a stroke he suffered in late December.

A government commission, the &lt;a href="w%3ARettig%20Report"&gt;Rettig Commission&lt;/a&gt;, listed 2,095 deaths and 1,102 disappearances during his 17-year rule. In 2004 the Valech Report that was issued after interviewing an estimated 35,000 people who claimed to have been abused by the regime; 28,000 were regarded legitimate.

The crimes were allegedly committed as part of &lt;a href="w%3AOperation%20Condor"&gt;Operation Condor&lt;/a&gt;, a campaign of assassination and terrorization meant to suppress left-wing opposition to Pinochet's regime. The Chilean-led program soon spread to other military regimes throughout Latin America, and may have had at least tacit complicity by then-U.S. Secretary of State &lt;a href="w%3AHenry%20Kissinger"&gt;Henry Kissinger&lt;/a&gt;. The Pinochet dictatorship ruled Chile from 1973 until 1990, gaining power after a military coup overthrew the democratically-elected socialist President &lt;a href="w%3ASalvador%20Allende"&gt;Salvador Allende&lt;/a&gt;.

After two weekends of box office domination, Universal Pictures' ♡❤Meet the Fockers♡❤ will be challenged for the top spot by horror film ♡❤White Noise♡❤, also from Universal, which opens in wide release Friday.
To be considered in wide release, a film must open or play in at least 1,000 theatres throughout the U.S. and Canada. With ♡❤Noise♡❤ being the only new wide release movie for the weekend, it looks to take advantage of movie goers looking from a change from holiday themed film fare.

♡❤Noise♡❤ is a come-back attempt for &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Keaton"&gt;Michael Keaton&lt;/a&gt;, who hasn't had a hit movie since 1992's ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABatman%20Returns"&gt;Batman Returns&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. But according to one critic, this film may not be a comeback hit for Keaton.

"♡❤White Noise♡❤ never gives skeptics a chance to enjoy the film. I also suspect even believers will be bored," Jack Garner, film critic for ♡❤Gannet News Service♡❤ said. Garner's not alone in panning the film. According to web site &lt;a href="http%3A//www.rottentomatoes.com/"&gt;RottenTomatoes.com&lt;/a&gt;, 87 percent of film critics in its survey have given the film a bad review. 

"The nominal thriller ♡❤White Noise♡❤ is worthy neither of Michael Keaton's talents nor even a desperate horror fan's attention," Manohla Dargis, film critic for the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Times"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, said.

But not all reviews were bad. ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AHollywood%20Reporter"&gt;Hollywood Reporter&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ critic, Kirk Honeycutt said, "Even though logic takes a holiday in ♡❤White Noise♡❤, Geoffrey Sax, a British television director making his theatrical debut, lavishes enough craft on the paranormal thriller to send more than a few chills down the spine."

The movie faces stiff competition as five other films have a wider release, playing in more theatres and reaching a larger potential audience. Universal's ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMeet%20the%20Fockers"&gt;Meet the Fockers&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, the sequel to 2000's ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMeet%20the%20Parents"&gt;Meet the Parents&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ is playing in about 1,000 more theatres than ♡❤Noise♡❤ and could dominate the box office for a third weekend.

'Fockers', starring Ben Stiller, Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand, has made $186.5 million since its release Dec. 22, according to Box Office Mojo.

<h2>Wide release films for the weekend of Jan. 7</h2>
The following films will be playing in at least 1,000 U.S. and Canada venues:

U.S. citizens donating in 2005 to help tsunami victims may write off their donations on their 2004 tax returns, thanks to a bill quickly passed in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;U.S. House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;U.S. Senate&lt;/a&gt; on a voice vote, and signed into law by president &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;.

Without the new law, contributors would have waited until 2006 and their 2005 tax returns to be able to write off their charitable donations. The law is intended to promote donating towards the tsunami relief effort.

CBS News reports Indiana University's Center on Philanthropy is estimating approximately 322 million U.S. dollars in goods and cash have been donated by private U.S. citizens and corporations, in addition to the 350 million that was promised by the government.

An &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;AP&lt;/a&gt;/ISOS poll has found three in ten U.S. citizens have donated to Tsunami Aid organizations.

A launch on December 21, 2004 by Boeing with a new "Delta IV Heavy" rocket from Cape Canaveral failed to place a 'dummy' satellite into its intended orbit, but the launch was considered successful by Air Force officials. 

The dummy satellite, the purpose of which was to monitor the Delta IV launch, as well as two experimental nanosatellites, provided by the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory to take digital photos of cloud formations and to test the effectiveness of materials in spacecraft, were lost.

Boeing's Vice President for Expendable Launch Systems, Dan Collins, said that the rocket malfunction was caused by a shorter first stage burn then was expected. This was compensated for during flight, however the fuel lost in the process limited final stages of the burn and was responsible for the payload not achieving orbit

A Boeing spokesman, Robert Villanueva, agreed that many flight objectives were achieved, but did not call the launch a success. "We do have an outstanding issue we need to work on before our first operational launch next year," Villanueva said. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.space.com/missionlaunches/delta4hvy_update_041223.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Boeing was paid at least $140 million by the U.S. Air Force to place a 'dummy' satellite into geosynchronous orbit, 22,300 miles from Earth, according to the FAA. The launch was a demonstration for the Air Force's Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) program.

Collins also reported, "We now have enough information and confidence in the Delta IV Heavy to move forward with preparations for the upcoming Defense Support Program launch in 2005. The mission has met all its major objectives. The US Air Force - was very, very happy." &lt;a href="http%3A//www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/973.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The 23-story rocket, a heavy-lift variant of the Delta 4 family, lifted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida on Dec. 21 at 4:50 p.m. (2150 GMT). The launch was delayed three times in December due to weather problems and technical glitches. 

The Delta IV Heavy is scheduled to carry the final Defense Support Program missile launch detection satellite to orbit this August. A National Reconnaissance Office classified payload is set to be aboard the second operational launch scheduled for December 2005.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUSS%20San%20Francisco"&gt;USS San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; ran aground, or hit bottom, while underwater approximately 350 miles (563 kilometers) south of the South Pacific island of Guam today at about noon local time (2 a.m. UTC).

It is unknown the full extent of the damage and injuries, but at least one person has died and several lesser injuries are known. The submarine is on the surface now and is on its way to a port in Guam.

The Los Angeles class submarine had no reports of damage to the &lt;a href="w%3AS6G%20reactor"&gt;reactor plant&lt;/a&gt;, which is operating normally.

Military and Coast Guard aircraft are enroute to monitor and assist in the situation.

The Cassini space probe, currently in orbit around the planet Saturn, has returned extraordinary pictures from the Saturnian satellite 
&lt;a href="w%3AIapetus%20%28moon%29"&gt;Iapetus&lt;/a&gt;.

It has long been known to astronomers that Iapetus's surface is divided into two hemispheres, one dark, one light. Now a narrow ridge of massive proportions, 20 km high and 1,300 km long, has been found around the equator of the moon. The height rivals Olympus Mons on Mars-- but Mars is five times bigger than Iapetus.

The origin of this feature is currently unknown. Cassini will next fly by Iapetus in September 2007. The images returned from that pass will have over 100 times greater resolution than the current ones, and scientists hope they will help unravel the mystery.

&lt;a href="w%3AIapetus%20%28moon%29"&gt;Iapetus&lt;/a&gt;, Saturn's third largest moon, has a diameter of about 1,436 km (892 miles). &lt;a href="w%3AGiovanni%20Domenico%20Cassini"&gt;Jean-Dominque Cassini&lt;/a&gt; discovered the moon in 1672; it was also Cassini who determined the color difference on Iapetus.

The &lt;a href="w%3ACassini-Huygens"&gt;Cassini-Huygens&lt;/a&gt; mission, named after Giovanni Domenico Cassini (Jean-Dominque Cassini), is a collaborative project with the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Space%20Agency"&gt;European Space Agency&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AItalian%20Space%20Agency"&gt;Italian Space Agency&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3ARabies"&gt;Rabies&lt;/a&gt; is a disease that has no cure and nearly everyone it infects is dead just two weeks after the symptoms show. And yet, last week a teenage girl named &lt;a href="w%3AJeanna%20Giese"&gt;Jeanna Giese&lt;/a&gt; was released from a hospital having been successfuly treated. She became the first known person to recover from the disease without vaccination.

On September 12, 2004, Jeanna &amp;mdash; a 15 year old from Fond du Lac, Wisconsin&amp;mdash; was bitten by a bat while attending church. By the time she saw a doctor about fatigue and numbness, it was October 18, and the bat incident was not brought up until several days later. Usually when there is a possibility of rabies, doctors will vaccinate patients: the vaccine has a chance to act before the symptoms appear. In Jeanna's case it was too late to try to vaccinate, and her doctors at the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin devised a new treatment. Jeanna was put into a drug-induced coma for a week, and doctors began an intensive treatment to prop up her nervous system until her natural immunity recovered enough to fight the disease.

By surviving and recovering, Jeanna became the only person known in medicine to overcome rabies without a vaccine. She is not yet fully recovered: the effects of the coma are still apparent, and she has difficulty with movement. Yet the doctors believe that she is getting well much faster than they expected, and feel that Jeanna will be able to return to her high school studies, needing only physical and occupational therapy.

The novel treatment is hailed by doctors as promising, but needs analysis and verification on another human. Jeanna's is the sixth case of human recovery from a rabies infection, but the other five people were vaccinated against rabies either before infection, or before the symptoms appeared.

Early on Saturday morning a severe storm swept northern England and parts of Wales bringing destruction and widespread disruption. Gusts of up to 128mph were recorded on high ground at 7am UTC.

Carlisle, Cumbria, saw its worst flooding for thirty years and was completely cut off by fallen trees and flood water. Three people died and more than 3,000 people were evacuted from their homes. Elsewhere, one man was swept away and drowned in a swollen river and another is missing.

A village in the mountainous region of Snowdonia saw 225.4 mm of rain in the 72 hours leading up to 6am UTC Saturday. The monthly average rainfall for the region is 270 mm. Many rivers have burst their banks, and although warnings were issued, there has been much damage to buildings in low-lying areas.

Off the coast of Scotland, a P&amp;O passenger ferry was forced aground stranding the 100 passengers and crew for 24 hours until the ship could be re-floated at high tide. No-one was injured.

<h1>Peace agreement signed in Sudan</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Peace%20agreement%20signed%20in%20Sudan&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

In the &lt;a href="Sudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt;, a peace treaty has been signed that many hope will end the almost 20 year long civil war. 

Rebel leader Dr. John Garang and Sudanese Vice President Ali Osman Mohamed Taha signed the agreement with foreign leaders such as &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; Secretary of State &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AColin%20Powell"&gt;Colin Powell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and thousands of members of the public witnessing the event at Nyayo National Stadium in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANairobi"&gt;Nairobi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Kenya"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt;. The deal will see Sudan's rich oil reserves being split fairly north&amp;ndash;south.

The war was between the &lt;a href="Islam"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; north and the &lt;a href="Christianity"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Sudan"&gt;south&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and over the last two decades has resulted in the death of 1.5 m people. However, this agreement does not solve the separate, more recent and on-going conflict in &lt;a href="Darfur"&gt;Darfur&lt;/a&gt;. It is hoped this agreement may pave away to a similar treaty to end that conflict.

Israel – Palestinians are going to the polls in order to elect a new leader after the death of Yasser Arafat last year. Hundreds of international monitors are over-seeing the elections.

There are six candidates:
<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud%20Abbas"&gt;Mahmoud Abbas&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AFatah"&gt;Fatah&lt;/a&gt;)
BULLET::::- Mustafa Barghouti
BULLET::::- Tayser Khalid (&lt;a href="w%3ADFLP"&gt;DFLP&lt;/a&gt;)
BULLET::::- Bassam al-Salhi (leftist)
BULLET::::- Sayyed Baraka Abdul Karim Shubayr
BULLET::::- Abdul Halim Ashqar

</ul>
Mahmoud Abbas, who was the interim leader, is expected by many to win. He is a moderate and many hope he will be able to establish peace with Israel, who refused to deal with Yassar Arafat because of his support for anti-Israel militants who target civilians. Abbas doesn't support armed conflict, and is calling for peace talks.

Polls opened at 5 a.m. local, and were scheduled to close at 5 p.m., but a two hour extension was made due to the large turnout.

Voting is said to be going well in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank but there have been reports of difficulties in Jerusalem (where ex-US President Jimmy Carter is observing). Over 500 Palestinians have been turned away by the Israelis running the polling station. Carter is said to be 'unhappy'.

&lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; eased some travel restrictions in &lt;a href="w%3AGaza"&gt;Gaza&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Bank"&gt;West Bank&lt;/a&gt;, but some of the 500 international election observers reported new checkpoints in some areas. The entry points to &lt;a href="w%3AEgypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;, which have been closed for several months by Israel, remain closed with up to 21,000 Palestinians trapped on the other side, unable to vote in today's election. 

The final results of the 2005 Palestinian presidential election are expected on Monday, January 10, 2005.

Polls have closed in the occupied territories with many exit polls showing that of the seven candidates for Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas has a large lead. Voting ended at 1900 UTC, two hours later than planned due to earlier voting difficulties. While the large influx of late voting added to a heavy turnout means that official totals may be delayed until Monday, the primary results are anything but close.

The Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research's exit poll indicates that Abbas has won 66.3% of the vote, while the next closest candidate polled 19.7%. None of the other candidate gained more than 3.8% of the vote.

Abbas supporters have already begun celebrating, according to correspondents, waving flags and carrying posters of Abbas through the streets. They hope that by winning by a large mandate Abbas will have a strong platform to pursue his policies of negotiation with Israel.

The voting went peacefully for the most part, the most noticeable exception being problems with voter registration and the turning away of hundreds of voters from a large Israeli-run polling station in East Jerusalem.

A spacecraft designed to chase a comet and crash onto its surface is scheduled for a launch on January 12, 2005 and 1:48 p.m. EST. In early July the probe, named &lt;a href="w%3ADeep%20Impact%20%28space%20mission%29"&gt;Deep Impact&lt;/a&gt;, will approach Comet &lt;a href="w%3ATempel%201"&gt;Tempel 1&lt;/a&gt; to take a number of measurements and photographs. The probe will then split in two, with one part &amp;mdash; containing an 820-pound copper weight &amp;mdash; propelling itself towards the path of the comet. Twenty-four hours after separation the comet will crash into the slower-moving impactor, creating a crater 100 meters wide.

Astronomers know little of the nuclei of comets, and this mission was designed to determine the make-up of comets' cores. The event will be watched by many instruments: there are two cameras on the part of the probe that is not getting destroyed, a camera on the impactor will broadcast almost until the crash, and telescopes around Earth will also be aimed at the point of the impact. Scientists hope that by studying the depth of the crater and the material ejected from the comet in the crash they will get a better idea of the core's composition.

The probe is named Deep Impact after a &lt;a href="w%3ADeep%20Impact%20%28movie%29"&gt;Hollywood movie of the same title&lt;/a&gt;. In the movie a comet is bombarded with warheads in order to steer it off a collision course with Earth. Unlike the movie, however, the goal of this mission is not to destroy the comet. Indeed, probe's size makes it very unlikely that the comet will suffer more than a crater: the comet is 3.7 miles wide while the probe is about the size of a washing machine.

The probe will be launched aboard a &lt;a href="w%3ADelta%20II"&gt;Delta II&lt;/a&gt; rocket from &lt;a href="w%3ACape%20Canaveral"&gt;Cape Canaveral&lt;/a&gt; in Florida.

Around seventy new species of microbes have been discovered in a highly concentrated salt basin of the Mediterranean Sea, so salty that almost half of the liquid is magnesium chloride. Researchers, led by Paul van der Wielen at the University of Groningen in the &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, found abundant colonies of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ahalophile"&gt;halophile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; microbes in ancient salty pockets that are devoid of oxygen.

It has been suggested that pools of a similar liquid might be able to exist on &lt;a href="Mars"&gt;Mars&lt;/a&gt;, providing a possible niche for simple life to exist there.

<h1>Wells Fargo and Barclay's rumoured to be in merger talks</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Wells%20Fargo%20and%20Barclay%27s%20rumoured%20to%20be%20in%20merger%20talks&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Sunday Express, a tabloid newspaper from the UK reported an anonymous source claiming to be an insider to merger talks between Wells Fargo Bank and Barclays Bank. 

The rumoured merger would be a radical break in the kinds of mergers Wells Fargo has done and has said it will continue to do (it is assumed that Wells with the higher market capitalization would be the buyer). 

Wells Fargo has previously shown no desire to engage in retail banking outside the United States, and has only expanded internationally in its Consumer Finance business and with certain business services. 

Wells Fargo currently has a market value of 100 billion, while Barclays is worth 70 billion. The wire services such as Reuters immediately wrote articles about the rumour. Barclays refused to comment on market speculation (it is standard for all corporations to consistently refuse to comment on all merger speculation). 

No reporters have so far been able to reach Wells Fargo for comment. It is claimed that talks have been ongoing since October, although they are said to have stalled and then resumed.

There is however the possibility that Wells Fargo and Barclays could be contemplating a business line sale, instead of a full on merger. One possibility is Barclays selling its "Barclays Global Investor" division back to Wells Fargo. 

Wells Fargo (under old management prior to the 1998 merger of Wells Fargo and Norwest Bank) previously sold its Asset Management (mutual fund) business to Barclays in 1995. Renamed Barclays Global Investors, this business remains headquartered in San Francisco, and still has some connections to Wells Fargo's new mutual fund business. 

Wells Fargo has a long term goal of deriving around 25% of its revenue from investments and insurance; currently it derives around 15 percent of its revenue from this. The purchase of Barclays Global Investor would significantly move Wells Fargo toward achieving this goal.

Another possibility is Barclays buying the private label (or store branded) credit cards of Wells Fargo Financial. In November, Barclays acquired Juniper, a fast growing player in the US private label credit card business.

Friends of the son of the &lt;a href="Brazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;ian President, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALuis%20Inacio%20Lula%20da%20Silva"&gt;Luis Inacio Lula da Silva&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , have published photos of themselves partying on vacation in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABrasilia"&gt;Brasilia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The news caused arguments and protests amongst many Brazilians, with allegations that the government were paying the expenses.
The group of teenagers is shown cavorting at the official residences of Granja do Torto and Palácio do Alvorada, both in Brasilia; near a Brazilian Air Force airplane; travelling by motor boat in Paranoá lake; and with Brazilian soccer player &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APel%C3%A9"&gt;Pelé&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

At first, the photos appeared in the photoblogs &lt;a href="http%3A//www.fotolog.net/tata_lulu"&gt;www.fotolog.net/tata_lulu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.fotolog.net/feijao_fodao"&gt;www.fotolog.net/feijao_fodao&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http%3A//www.fotolog.net/gringo_mi"&gt;www.fotolog.net/gringo_mi&lt;/a&gt;. But since the publication of the news by the local newspapers &lt;a href="http%3A//www.folha.uol.com.br"&gt;Folha de São Paulo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http%3A//www.estadao.com.br"&gt;Estado de São Paulo&lt;/a&gt;, the photoblogs were deleted or the photos removed. Some of the photos however, still are available at some user and newspaper sites on the Internet. 

Since the incident, several people have created &lt;a href="https%3A//www.orkut.com/Login.aspx"&gt;Orkut&lt;/a&gt; communities which comment, joke, and protest about what has happened. One of these communities, named "Férias na Alvorada - EU QUERO!" (Vacations at Alvorada - I WANT IT!"), had 450 members as of January 7th. 

The Brazilian government declined to comment on the pictures.

After winning the election of January 9, 2005 by a large margin, new Palestinian leader &lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud%20Abbas"&gt;Mahmoud Abbas&lt;/a&gt; offered peace to &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;. Israel reportedly welcomed the result and asked Mr Abbas to "clamp down" on &lt;a href="w%3APalestinian"&gt;Palestinian&lt;/a&gt; militants. 

Abbas said he wants to meet Israel's Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AAriel%20Sharon"&gt;Ariel Sharon&lt;/a&gt; soon. US President George W. Bush has indicated he will invite Abbas to the United States for talks, something he never did with Abbas's predecessor, the late &lt;a href="w%3AYasser%20Arafat"&gt;Yasser Arafat&lt;/a&gt;. 

The EU monitoring team present during the elections commented on the uniqueness of democratic elections in territory under military occupation. Leaders, including the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20of%20America"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; president and &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Commission"&gt;European Commission&lt;/a&gt; president, have praised the election process.

Reports indicate some problems surfaced during the voting.

According to observers, some Palestinians not on the register were allowed to vote while others who believed they were eligible were turned away. Observers also noted registered names were missing from the Jerusalem roll, leading to voters being turned away. Polling was prolonged for two hours due to an influx of late voters.

Preliminary voting results:

♡❤♡Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen): 62.3%♡❤♡

♡❤♡Mustafa Barghouti: 19.8%♡❤♡

The primary suspect in the murder of student Sarah Gleeson apparently set himself on fire, then threw himself from a seventh floor window of the Corus Hotel early on Saturday morning, January 8.

Police indicated they were seeking to question the suspect, David Atkinson, prior to his death. Atkinson was a Lance-Corporal in the British Army. He had been present in Cambridge on New Year's Eve, but failed to report for duty to his barracks in Waterbeach on January 4.

Sarah Gleeson disappeared in Cambridge on New Year's Eve, and her body was discovered on January 8, shortly after Atkinson's apparent suicide. Investigators are working to determine more details about the circumstances and cause of both deaths.

Atkinson had been charged with kidnap and assault in a separate case involving a Polish woman, although the Ministry of Defence stated that he had been cleared of those charges in 1998.

Esmeralda, Minas Gerais, &lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; – 
The members of the Brazilian &lt;a href="w%3ALandless%20Workers%20Movement"&gt;Landless Workers Movement (Movimento Sem Terra, or MST)&lt;/a&gt; have decided they will not leave their camp, called Carlos Lamarca, an invaded area of Casa Grande farm. The farm is located at Esmeralda City, a metropolitan area of &lt;a href="w%3ABelo%20Horizonte"&gt;Belo Horizonte&lt;/a&gt;, in the Brazilian state of &lt;a href="w%3AMinas%20Gerais"&gt;Minas Gerais&lt;/a&gt;. Since the judge Dr. Cláudio José Coelho's deadline time giving to them abandoning the area expired yesterday, the arrival of the police force could occur at any time. 

Helio do Carmo, a member of MST said, "At this moment, the important thing is staying at the camp and resist." Help is being provided by other MST camps in the region.

Belo Horizonte, a city of 2 million inhabitants, is the capital of Minas Gerais, a state in southeastern Brazil.

The Brazilian government news agency Radiobrás (ABr) website has completed a move to &lt;a href="w%3AFree%20software"&gt;free software&lt;/a&gt;. As of January 9, the agency's website is in compliance with the Brazilian government's program to use free software throughout the public sector.

&lt;a href="w%3AFree%20software"&gt;Free software&lt;/a&gt; is software which, once obtained, can be used, copied, studied, modified and redistributed. It is often made available online without charge or offline for the cost of distribution; free software is not limited to being given away, but can be "free as in free speech" and sold for profit. Some of the most well-known examples of free software are the &lt;a href="w%3ALinux"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aoperating%20system"&gt;operating system&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AMozilla"&gt;Mozilla&lt;/a&gt; web browser and the &lt;a href="w%3AOpenOffice"&gt;OpenOffice&lt;/a&gt; office suite. 

About 25 people worked on this change. The change has taken about a year and a half, since the first changes of some workstations and &lt;a href="w%3Aserver"&gt;servers&lt;/a&gt; of Radiobrás. 

The switch to free software is being implemented by the National Institute of Technology of Information (ITI), inspired by similar decisions made in another countries. A reduction in service costs is expected.

A 25-page briefing paper released by the &lt;a href="w%3AHuman%20Rights%20Watch"&gt;Human Rights Watch&lt;/a&gt; reports torture, mass arrests and increasing persecution of Montagnard &lt;a href="w%3AChristian"&gt;Christians&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AVietnam"&gt;Vietnam's&lt;/a&gt; Central Highlands. According to Human Rights Watch there is more extensive use of torture against activists, individuals and religious leaders who have been expelled or returned from &lt;a href="w%3ACambodia"&gt;Cambodia&lt;/a&gt;.

The practice of self-criticism sessions, where Montagnard villagers are forced by officials to renounce Christianity and every political or religious activities in public is common. Human Rights Watch received complaints about these practices at provincies of Dak Lak, Kon Tum, Dak Nong and Gia Lai during 2004.

According to the report, in December, the month of Christmas, police force were engaged in rounding up and arresting dozens of Montagnard Christians and detaining them at district and provincial police stations and prisons throughout the region. The police arrested 129 people between December 12 and 24 in Gia Lai province, one of five provinces in the Central Highlands.

On April 10, 2004, a 25-year-old man was arrested by the police of Dak Nong province. During the interrogation the police officers extracted one of his toe nails, beat him with a rubber baton, broke his front teeth by beating him repeatedly and they intimidated him with a AK-47 rifle. The police officers threatened him by putting a pile of electrical wire in his front but they didn't shock him. Regularly they soak people in water and shock them until they get unconscious.

A man who described himself as a activist with the Dega church movement described his arrest and torture by police in Dark Doa district in March 2003:♡❤I was on my way to another village with my little boy to attend a wedding when they arrested me. They took me to the district police station, where they blindfolded me. They sat me in a chair and forced me to hold my hands up in the air for almost seven hours. Policemen on either side of me twisted pens between my fingers and beat my feet with a wooden stick. At the same time they jabbed me in the ribs with their hands. The worst part was that they forced my three-year-old son to sit on my lap the entire time, even though he was crying uncontrollably.♡❤

Dak Nong, a church elder from Cu Jut district said authorities have recorded members of his village church committee delivering bibles to officials. Nong said that the video was used later in television in a false report: ♡❤when it was shown on television the announcer said we were voluntarily giving up the bibles. In fact, we were forced.♡❤

Guatemala has nominated a Nobel Peace Prize winner, indigenous rights worker Rigoberta Menchú, 46, to become the next Secretary General of the &lt;a href="w%3AOrganization%20of%20American%20States"&gt;Organization of American States (OAS)&lt;/a&gt;.

The post became available after the previous Secretary General, Miguel Ángel Rodriguez, served for only 24 days of his term of office, before returning home to Costa Rica to face corruption charges.

Luigi R. Einaudi, the former Assistant Secretary General, is serving as Acting Secretary General until the OAS decides who will serve for the remainder of the current term of office.

Before Menchú was nominated, the Central American states had decided that the candidate should be from Central America. But the Rodriguez scandal has made it difficult for the Central American states to find another candidate they could all endorse.

Chile and Mexico have proposed their own candidate for the job.

President Oscar Berger of Guatemala agrees that Menchú should be the Central American candidate. Menchú has said that if the Central American nations are in agreement, she will happily stand as their candidate.

An indigenous Guatemalan, Menchú won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1992, and was also prominent in her opposition to the previous FRG government which Berger defeated.

Menchú works for the current government as Good Will Ambassador for the 1996 peace accord.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Mamdouh%20Habib%20to%20be%20released%20from%20Guantanamo%20Bay%20without%20charge&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Australian Attorney General, &lt;a href="w%3APhilip%20Ruddock"&gt;Philip Ruddock&lt;/a&gt;, has announced that the US is not charging Australian &lt;a href="w%3AMamdouh%20Habib"&gt;Mamdouh Habib&lt;/a&gt; and plans to release him from &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20Bay"&gt;Guantanamo Bay&lt;/a&gt;, after three years of detention. Mr Habib, accused of aiding &lt;a href="w%3AAl-Qaeda"&gt;al Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; by the US, was unlikely to be charged over the accusation upon returning to Australia.

Recently enacted Australian laws could not be applied retroactively, according to Mr Ruddock, quoted by the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.smh.com.au"&gt;Sydney Morning Herald&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday. "Those terrorism offences are not retrospective and therefore cannot apply to Mr Habib's alleged activities and associations prior to his capture," he said.

Australian ABC Radio programme &lt;a href="http%3A//www.abc.net.au/am"&gt;AM&lt;/a&gt; reported last week of fresh allegations that Egyptian born Australian, Mr Habib was inappropriately photographed in the presence of an Australian Government official, and describing bizarre and intricate tortures it is claimed he was subjected to, which he says caused him to make admissions he now regrets.

Mr Habib's US lawyer Joe Margulies, says in a News Ltd article, that Habib received electric shocks and was beaten, kicked and subjected to water torture while imprisoned in Pakistan and Egypt, and was further tortured in the presence of US and Australian officials at Guantanamo Bay.

According to Philip Ruddock, "It remains the strong view of the United States that, based on information available to it Mr Habib had prior knowledge of the terrorist attacks on or before the 11th of September, 2001. Mr Habib has acknowledged he spent time in Afghanistan, and others there at the time claimed he trained with al-Qaeda.

"We have requested the United States authorities to inform Mr Habib of their decision not to prosecute him and of the agreement to repatriate him to Australia."

&lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Hicks"&gt;David Hicks&lt;/a&gt;, now the only Australian detained at Guantanamo Bay, will face trial by a military commission in March on charges of attempted murder, conspiracy and aiding the enemy, according to a second Sydney Morning Herald article.

After months of secrecy and lawsuits intended to suppress reporting on unannounced products by independent news outlets, &lt;a href="Steve%20Jobs"&gt;Steve Jobs&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of &lt;a href="Apple%20Computer"&gt;Apple Computer&lt;/a&gt;, began his keynote address at 17:11 UTC this morning, before an enthusiastic audience.

<h1>Bush nominates Chertoff for new Secretary of Homeland Security</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Bush%20nominates%20Chertoff%20for%20new%20Secretary%20of%20Homeland%20Security&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

U.S. President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; nominated Federal Judge Michael Chertoff as the next &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Homeland%20Security"&gt;Secretary of Homeland Security&lt;/a&gt;, replacing Secretary Tom Ridge who plans to step down Feb. 1.

Judge Chertoff has been approved by the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; on three previous occasions and is currently a U.S. Appeals Court judge in &lt;a href="w%3APhiladelphia%2C%20Pennsylvania"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;. He is considered a "safe" candidate, likely to pass Senate scrutiny, a key characteristic after the &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;'s previous candidate, former New York Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik, withdrew after personal information was made public.

At the time of the &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%2C%202001%20attacks"&gt;September 11 attacks&lt;/a&gt;, Judge Chertoff was in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice"&gt;Justice Department&lt;/a&gt; and became involved as one of the architects of the &lt;a href="w%3APatriot%20Act"&gt;Patriot act&lt;/a&gt;.

If confirmed Chertoff vowed his primary focus as Secretary to be, "promoting our homeland security and, as important, to preserving our fundamental liberties."

Another confirmed case of &lt;a href="w%3Abovine%20spongiform%20encephalopathy"&gt;bovine spongiform encephalopathy&lt;/a&gt; (BSE, or "mad cow disease") was reported today to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA). The infected cow was found in the province of &lt;a href="w%3AAlberta"&gt;Alberta&lt;/a&gt;, where two previous cases of BSE have been reported in the past year. The cow itself was born in March of 1998, mere months after a ban placed by the CFIA to stop the use of any feed which might contain any "specified risk material"-- material that is known to carry the BSE agent. The cow's origin is still unknown.

The CFIA is now in control of the carcass and makes clear that no part of the cow has entered the food supply.

A team of experts from the United States have been sent to re-evaluate the situation and to make recommendations about reopening the U.S. border. The border was closed to beef exports after the first incident of BSE was reported in Canada. The closure continues to cause major problems for Canadian beef farmers who depended on the United States beef market.

The following stories made international headlines Wednesday:

<h3>&lt;a href="w%3ANortel"&gt;Nortel&lt;/a&gt; completes restatement</h3>

After 14 months, three missed deadlines, and a change of CEOs, &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada's&lt;/a&gt; Nortel (ticker NT) finally reported their audited restatement of earnings for 2001, 2002, and 2003. Five board members are stepping down.

<h3>Former Philippine president &lt;a href="w%3AJoseph%20Estrada"&gt;Joseph Estrada&lt;/a&gt; in Hong Kong hospital</h3>

Police reported to the Sandiganbayan, the anti-graft court investigating the former Philippine president, and leaked to the press, that Estrada had hosted members of his former cabinet for dinner and stayed overnight away from the hospital in which he is supposed to be confined. He is in hospital to undergo knee replacement surgery.

<h3>Interim Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AIyad%20Allawi"&gt;Iyad Allawi&lt;/a&gt; acknowledges issues for Jan. 30 poll</h3>

As new attacks kill at least 25 people, interim Prime Minister Allawi admitted not all Iraqis would be able to vote:

"There are some pockets that will not participate in the election but they are not large."

As winds in the UK reach 124 mph, a Spanish fishing trawler is missing off the coast of Scotland and three people have died in northern Britain.

The UK Coastguard received an emergency beacon signal via satellite at 2330 UTC last night from a boat in the North Atlantic, 180 miles west of Scotland. No voice radio traffic had been received since the ship's owners talked to the captain at 2030, when the crew reported that they were in difficulties and were losing power. There are 19 crew members on board, five Spansish and fourteen Portuguese. An RAF Nimrod search aircraft is due on-scene at dawn to search for the vessel.

Two lorries have been blown over. In Scotland, the lorry fell onto a car, killing the driver. In Northern Ireland, the lorry was blown off a bridge into the sea, killing the driver of the lorry. A third person died in Scotland when a van was blown into the path of an on-coming lorry. 

Across Scotland, 60,000 people are without power, many roads are blocked by fallen trees, trains are not running and ferries are restricted to port. The Sellafield nuclear fuel reprocessing plant in northern England has suffered superficial damage.

&lt;a href="CBS%20News"&gt;CBS News&lt;/a&gt; dismissed four employees Tuesday, including three executives, in the aftermath of an investigation into a faulty news story about President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADan%20Rather"&gt;Dan Rather&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who reported the story, is not included in these dismissals. 

The discharged employees were: Betsy West, senior vice president and overseer of CBS News primetime programs, Josh Howard, ♡❤60 Minutes Wednesday♡❤ executive producer, Mary Murphy, senior broadcast producer and Mary Mapes, program producer. 

On Sept. 8, 2004 &lt;a href="CBS"&gt;CBS&lt;/a&gt; presented in &lt;a href="60%20Minutes"&gt;60 Minutes Wednesday program&lt;/a&gt;, a story about President George W. Bush &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATexas%20Air%20National%20Guard"&gt;Texas Air National Guard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; service during the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVietnam%20War"&gt;Vietnam War&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The news questioned Bush's commitment to service, saying he refused an order to appear for a physical exam and that Bush family tried to favour him. The news relied on four documents apparently written by Lt. Col. Jerry Killian (already dead), Bush's Texas Air National Guard commanders in the early 1970s.

Critics said the documents were fake. After standing its story for about 12 days CBS admitted they could not confirm the authenticity of the documents and asked former attorney General Dick Thornburgh and former &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; President Louis Boccardi to start an independent investigation about it. 

The independent panel was not able to make any conclusions about the authenticity of the documents and found that political bias was not a factor, but it did criticize the producers for failing to follow basic journalistic principles when they made no attempt to verify their source's claims.

CBS President &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALeslie%20Moonves"&gt;Leslie Moonves&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said about the matter: ♡❤We deeply regret the disservice this flawed 60 Minutes Wednesday report did to the American public, which has a right to count on CBS News for fairness and accuracy.♡❤

Nine people have died in bush-fires in the region of the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia. The fire has spread over 40,000 hectares of scrub, bushland and farmland so far and is still burning out of control. Hundreds of firemen have been fighting the fire, but conditions have been difficult because of strong winds and temperatures soaring well over 40 degrees Celsius. Of the nine who have died, eight were attempting to escape the advancing fire in their cars. Four children were among the dead. Locals of some rural towns fled to the ocean to escape the fires. Thousands of sheep and cattle have also been killed in the fires.

Separate fires have also been burning around Mount Osmond and Cleland National Park in the Adelaide hills. No fatalities have been recorded in this region. Fires also burn in country Victoria.

Bush-fires are annual occurrences in Australia, but these fires have been the worst in terms of deaths since the Ash Wednesday fires that killed 28 people in South Australia. Two years ago, over 400 houses were burnt down in a bush fire in the Australian capital city, Canberra.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATitan%20%28moon%29"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , on January 14 at approximately 9 a.m.
&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The 318 kg probe will hit the Titan atmosphere at 6 kilometers per second. For the next 2.5 hours, Huygens will slow its descent and begin data transmission from on-board scientific packages to the Cassini Orbiter for relay to Earth. It will touch down on the Titan surface at approximately 11:30 a.m. UTC. The probe will continue data transmission for three to 30 minutes, providing it survives the descent and landing.

&lt;a href="NASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; launched Cassini-Huygens, the largest interplanetary space craft ever built,
on October 15, 1997. The craft arrived at Saturn orbit in July of 2004. It is the fourth craft to visit Saturn and the first to orbit the planet.

On December 25, 2004, the Cassini Orbiter released the Huygens Probe. The probe then began a 20-day trip to Titan.

Experiments on board the Huygens Probe are designed to examine chemical reactions in the atmosphere, the source of Titan's abundant methane gas, the existence of oceans, and the presence
of complex organic compounds.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a joint project of NASA and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Space%20Agency"&gt;European Space Agency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (ESA).

The probe was named after Dutch astronomer &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChristiaan%20Huygens"&gt;Christiaan Huygens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who discovered Titan in 1655.

The Cassini orbiter was named for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGiovanni%20Domenico%20Cassini"&gt;Jean-Dominique Cassini&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who discovered other moons of Saturn and the gap between Saturn's rings known as the 
&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACassini%20Division"&gt;Cassini Division&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The United States Government reported the largest trade deficit in its history today, totalling $60.3 billion for the month of November.

The Commerce Department reported a rise of 7.7% from the previous month, in an announcement that had taken economists and analysts by surprise. The reading had been expected to fall to $54 billion, following a softening in oil prices.

The trade deficit through November totaled $561.3 billion, far above the previous annual record of $496.5 billion set in 2003, and put the country on track to record a trade imbalance topping $610 billion when the December figures are added.

This afternoon the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARAF"&gt;RAF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; launched an operation to rescue nineteen sailors from a &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; trawler in difficulties in a North &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAtlantic%20Ocean"&gt;Atlantic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; storm.

Radio contact with the FV ♡❤Cibeles♡❤ was lost yesterday evening at 2030 UTC when the crew reported to the ship's owners that they were in trouble. Last night, &lt;a href="UK"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; Coastguard picked up a satellite emergency beacon signal as winds reached speeds of over 70 mph.

This morning a RAF Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft located the ship adrift 180 miles off the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AScottish%20Western%20Isles"&gt;Scottish Western Isles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . A nearby tanker, the ♡❤Aegean Spirit♡❤, diverted with the intention of taking the trawler in tow and arrived at 1500 UTC. 

However, the tanker was unable to take the trawler on tow, and with no other vessels capable of towing the ship nearby, the Coastguard Rescue Seeking helicopter "Mike Uniform" was launched from Stornoway to extract the crew. The tanker remained on scene to offer some protection from the weather, currently reported as gale force winds and rough seas.

United States – 
"&lt;a href="w%3AIBM"&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt; hereby commits not to assert any of the 500 U.S. patents listed below, as well as all counterparts of these patents issued in other countries, against the development, use or distribution of &lt;a href="w%3AOpen%20Source"&gt;Open Source Software&lt;/a&gt;." 
&lt;a href="http%3A//www.ibm.com/ibm/licensing/patents/pledgedpatents.pdf"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

So begins the pledge IBM has made to "any individual, community, or company" writing or using software defined as "open source" by the &lt;a href="w%3AOpen%20Source%20Initiative"&gt;Open Source Initiative&lt;/a&gt; (OSI).

The patents include software for text recognition and database management.&lt;a href="http%3A//news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4163975.stm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

"True innovation leadership is about more than just the numbers of patents granted. It's about innovating to benefit customers, partners and society", said Dr. John E. Kelly, IBM senior vice president, Technology and Intellectual Property. "Our pledge today is the beginning of a new era in how IBM will manage intellectual property."
&lt;a href="http%3A//www.ibm.com/news/us/en/2005/01/patents.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

"This is not a one-time event", said Dr. Kelly. "While IBM will continue to demonstrate leadership in patent output, through measures such as today's pledge, we will increasingly use patents to encourage and protect global innovation and interoperability through open standards and we urge others to do so as well."

Lawrence Lessig, law professor at &lt;a href="w%3AStanford%20Law%20School"&gt;Stanford Law School&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AFree%20software"&gt;free software&lt;/a&gt; proponent commented: "This is exciting. It is IBM making good on its commitment to encourage a different kind of software development and recognizing the burden that patents can impose."
&lt;a href="http%3A//www.groklaw.net/article.php%3Fstory%3D20050110235654673"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Not all are confident of IBM's motives, though.

Florian Mueller, campaign manager of anti-patent website,
&lt;a href="http%3A//www.nosoftwarepatents.com/"&gt;NoSoftwarePatents.com&lt;/a&gt;, accused IBM of hypocrisy because of lobbying in the &lt;a href="w%3AEU"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; to push through the
&lt;a href="w%3AEU%20Directive%20on%20the%20Patentability%20of%20Computer-Implemented%20Inventions"&gt;Computer Implemented Inventions Directive&lt;/a&gt;.

"IBM is just being hypocritical because they want to appease the open source community and make themselves popular," said Mueller.

"In Europe, IBM is a driving force behind the extension of the scope of patentability with respect to software. If IBM wants to assume the role of a post-Christmas benefactor, they'd better stop their aggressive patent lobbying in the EU and their shameless squeezing of small and medium-sized companies with its patent portfolio."

Iraqi Prime Minister Iyad Allawi said that on-going violence in Iraq may hamper the forthcoming elections for a new national government, due to be held on January 30.

"There are some pockets that will not participate in the election, but they are not large," Allawi said.

Fifteen people died in violence across Iraq today. A bomb blast in Tikrit killed six police officers and wounded a dozen. South of Baghdad, a bomb destroyed a minibus and killed seven civilians onboard. The bomb apparently was aimed at a US military convoy. Another bomb killed two people in Samarra.

Actor &lt;a href="http%3A//www.indianajones.com/bio/cast/amrishpuri.html"&gt;Amrish Puri&lt;/a&gt;, who was most known for his role as &lt;a href="http%3A//in.rediff.com/movies/2005/jan/12puri.htm"&gt;"Mogambo"&lt;/a&gt; in the movie "Mr. India" died of on Wednesday at the age of 72. Hospital sources say that his death was due to a blood clot in his brain after a brain haemorrhage. 

A veteran of sorts, Amrish worked in over &lt;a href="http%3A//www.imdb.com/name/nm0700869/"&gt;221 movies&lt;/a&gt; in his life time, most of which were in &lt;a href="w%3ABollywood"&gt;Bollywood&lt;/a&gt; (Mumbai, &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;). In his initial attempt to get into the movies in 1954, he was rejected during a screen-test for a hero's role and only started acting at the age of 40 &amp;mdash; nearly twenty years later. He went on to become the most popular "villain" on the silver screen.

Mark Thatcher, son of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, was fined US$500,000 and given a four-year suspended jail sentence after pleading guilty to unwittingly helping finance a coup plot.

Thatcher's plea-bargain terms include cooperating with investigators, despite having left Cape Town on Thursday to return to London.

The charges brought against him relate to the financing of a helicopter that he claimed was to have been used as an air ambulance. In his plea bargain, he admitted that he had realised the intended mercenary use of the helicopter before the conclusion of the deal.

South America – 
On December 14, Colombian officers arrested Rodrigo Granda, the chief of international relations for the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia - FARC. The Venezuelan government said Granda was arrested inside &lt;a href="w%3AVenezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;'s borders, so the arrest was illegal and Granda was actually kidnapped. The Colombian government said that Venezuelans detained Granda inside Venezuela borders because of a reward offered for his capture by the Colombian government. They said he was moved to the region near the border of Venezuela, but inside Colombian territory, where officers finally arrested him. 

The FARC is considered a &lt;a href="w%3Aterrorist"&gt;terrorist&lt;/a&gt; group by the government of Colombia and by the &lt;a href="w%3AUSA"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http%3A//www.state.gov/coalition/cr/fs/12713.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a Colombian ally in the fight against FARC.

The &lt;a href="w%3AFARC"&gt;FARC&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href="w%3AMarxist"&gt;Marxist&lt;/a&gt; revolutionary group with about 12,000 members. The group originated from the Colombian Communist Party of the 1960s. The FARC's main stated objective is the creation of a Communist government in Colombia. Colombian authorities routinely search their members.

During the Cold War, the movement received some help from the former Soviet Union. In recent years, the majority of its funding has come from kidnapping, extortion, hijacking, and illegal trade in &lt;a href="http%3A//www.fbi.gov/congress/congress03/mccraw052003.htm"&gt;cocaine&lt;/a&gt;. The FARC attacks Colombian political and military installations and what the group considers to be strategic targets.

The National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism, or MIPT, an organization based in Oklahoma, US, has associated FARC with 446 incidents resulting in 955 injuries and 429 fatalities since 1968. On September 19, 2004, the FARC killed Luis Eduardo Duque Varon, Antonio Jose Duque Varon, and Alfonso Lopez Nivia, a move supposedly motivated by the victims' involvement with the Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC).

There are evidences that the FARC has liaisons with Latin-American criminals, as for example the Brazilian drug-dealer &lt;a href="http%3A//www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/mundo/ult94u23513.shl"&gt;Fernandinho Beira-Mar&lt;/a&gt; arrested by Colombian army in Colombia near the border of Venezuela, Brazil and Colombia. Beira-Mar &lt;a href="http%3A//www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/cotidiano/ult95u27593.shl"&gt;confessed&lt;/a&gt; his liaisons with the guerrilla to authorities. According to the COBRA (alias for Colombia-Brazil) operation report of Brazilian police the FARC maintains drug factories in the &lt;a href="w%3AAmazon%20Rainforest"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, near the board of Colombia. The manufactered drugs would be dispatched &lt;a href="http%3A//www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/cotidiano/drogas.shtml"&gt;to Colombia, United States and Brazil&lt;/a&gt;. 

The FARC has advocates among some people and organizations in Latin America. Some of the group's principal sympathizers are located in Venezuela and Brazil. According to them the FARC is victim of a calumny campaign organized by their enemies, mainly the US.
FARC Commander Manuel Marulanda Vélez and others are part of the Marxist and revolutionary magazine &lt;a href="http%3A//www.nodo50.org/americalibre/consejo.htm"&gt;America Libre&lt;/a&gt;. The Brazilian Carlos Alberto Libânio Christo, known as Frei Betto, a celebrity in Brazil &lt;a href="w%3APT"&gt;PT&lt;/a&gt; and a personal friend of Lula, was former director of the magazine. Raul Reyes, a FARC commander, described the liaisons with President Lula in an interview to Folha de São Paulo newspaper in &lt;a href="http%3A//www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/mundo/ult94u62119.shtml"&gt;August 24 2003&lt;/a&gt; and said he met Lula for the first time in San Salvador during the &lt;a href="w%3AForo%20de%20S%C3%A3o%20Paulo"&gt;Foro de São Paulo&lt;/a&gt;. Olivio Dutra, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.cidades.gov.br/"&gt;Minister of Cities&lt;/a&gt; of Lula, received FARC leaders in 2001 when he was the &lt;a href="w%3ARio%20Grande%20do%20Sul"&gt;Rio Grande do Sul&lt;/a&gt; governor. In March 20, 2002, in &lt;a href="w%3ARibeir%C3%A3o%20Preto"&gt;Ribeirão Preto&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http%3A//www.estadao.com.br/agestado/noticias/2002/mar/20/9.htm"&gt;was open a pro-FARC comitee&lt;/a&gt; by the Sports Secretary Leopoldo Paulino (PSB) in the government of the mayor Antônio Palocci Filho (PT). Presently Palocci is the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.brasil.gov.br/estrutura.htm"&gt;Economy Minister&lt;/a&gt; of Lula government. Also the FARC is a member of the &lt;a href="w%3AForo%20de%20S%C3%A3o%20Paulo"&gt;Foro de São Paulo&lt;/a&gt; since 1990, organization guided by PT and Lula. Brazilian president &lt;a href="w%3ALuis%20Inacio%20Lula%20da%20Silva"&gt;Luis Inacio Lula da Silva&lt;/a&gt; don't recognize the FARC as a terrorist movement and say they don't have any illegal relationship with the organization. 
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez already admitted &lt;a href="http%3A//www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/mundo/ult94u68503.shtml"&gt;he encontered&lt;/a&gt; FARC leaders between 1998-2002. According to him the meetings were a request of Colombian President &lt;a href="w%3AAndr%C3%A9s%20Pastrana"&gt;Andrés Pastrana&lt;/a&gt; who wanted to negotiate with the rebels.
Venezuelan president has been repeatedly accused covering FARC. The Colombian Senator Enrique Gómez, member of the outer subjects commission of the Congress said in a interview to the Colombian Caracol Radio: "a conspiracy between the FARC and President Chávez has always existed" (&lt;a href="http%3A//www.caracol.com.co/realarchi.asp%3Fid%3D137933"&gt;♡❤♡audio♡❤♡&lt;/a&gt;). Colombian Senador Jimmy Chamorro has the same opinion:"there is no doubt about the narrow relation of Chávez and the FARC, and thus it is demonstrated with the case of the guerrilla Rodrigo Granda" (&lt;a href="http%3A//www.caracol.com.co/realarchi.asp%3Fid%3D137936"&gt;♡❤♡audio♡❤♡&lt;/a&gt;).
The US newspaper &lt;a href="http%3A//eltiempo.terra.com.co/coar/ANALISIS/analisis/ARTICULO-WEB-_NOTA_INTERIOR-1944101.html"&gt;Washington Post also accused&lt;/a&gt; Chavez of giving protection and suport to the FARC rebels.
The Venezuelan union leader of CTV (Confederación de Trabajadores de Venezuela - Confederations of Workers of Venezuela) who lives in Costa Rica(he requested political asylum) Carlos Ortega &lt;a href="http%3A//elpais-cali.terra.com.co/historico/feb132004/INT/A713N3.html"&gt;said about Chavez in 2004&lt;/a&gt;:"In Venezuela Chavez doesn't rule, who rules is &lt;a href="w%3AFidel%20Castro"&gt;Fidel Castro&lt;/a&gt;, the narc-guerilla mainly the FARC; in Venezuela who governs is the international terrorism." 
The Venezuelan deputy for the opposition Julio Montoya said that more than 500 members of FARC have become Venezuelan citizens irregularly and that they have Venezuelan identities. Chavez denies the allegations about his government covering the FARC guerrilla.

Since the arrest of Granda, Chavez is protesting and accusing Colombian authorities of entering illegally in Venezuela and kidnap. Chavez said in a interview to the journalist Eleazar Diaz Rangel (newspaper ♡❤Últimas Noticias♡❤) that he has proofs that Rodrigo Granda, FARC counselor, was captured illegally in &lt;a href="w%3ACaracas"&gt;Caracas&lt;/a&gt; and moved to &lt;a href="w%3AC%C3%BAcuta"&gt;Cúcuta&lt;/a&gt;, where the Colombian authorities said the arrestment was done (&lt;a href="http%3A//www.caracol.com.co/realarchi.asp%3Fid%3D138317"&gt;♡❤♡audio♡❤♡&lt;/a&gt;). 
According to him the Colombian authorities are lying when they said they arrested Granda inside Colombia (&lt;a href="http%3A//www.caracol.com.co/realarchi.asp%3Fid%3D138317"&gt;♡❤♡audio♡❤♡&lt;/a&gt;). The Vice-President of Venezuela protested against the Granda arrestment and &lt;a href="http%3A//www.caracol.com.co/nota.asp%3Fid%3D138328"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that if Colombia authorities wanted Granda, they should have requested his extradition by legall ways (&lt;a href="http%3A//www.caracol.com.co/realarchi.asp%3Fid%3D138328"&gt;♡❤♡audio♡❤♡)&lt;/a&gt;. 

According to the Colombian Minister of Defense, Jorge Alberto Uribe, the Colombian government paid a reward for the capture of Roberto Granda. Venezuelans detained Granda inside Venezuela borders because of a reward offered for his capture and they moved Granda to the region near the border of Venezuela, inside Colombian territory, where Colombian officers finally arrested him. Venezuelan deputy Luis Tascón said that the reward was of US $1.5 million. The Colombian government did not reveal the amount of the reward. 

Because of the Granda case the President Hugo Chavez said that the Venezuelan ambassador should leave &lt;a href="w%3ABogot%C3%A1"&gt;Bogotá&lt;/a&gt; in Colombia and that the trade agreements between Venezuela and Colombia should be paralised. Chavez demmands that the Colombian President &lt;a href="w%3AAlvaro%20Uribe"&gt;Alvaro Uribe&lt;/a&gt; do a public international retraction excusing for the invasion of the Venezuelan territory and the kidnapping of Granda.

Uribe proposed the creation of a special comissition, so the severe crisis can be resolved. He emphasize Colombia &lt;a href="http%3A//www.caracol.com.co/nota.asp%3Fid%3D138881"&gt;did not invaded the Venezuelan territory&lt;/a&gt;. The US governemnt supports Colombia in this crisis and demmands Chavez to give a clear declaration about &lt;a href="http%3A//eltiempo.terra.com.co/poli/2005-01-16/ARTICULO-WEB-_NOTA_INTERIOR-1944244.html"&gt;his position related to the FARC.&lt;/a&gt;

Mexican foreign minister Luis Ernesto Derbez says he is confident that he will become the next &lt;a href="w%3AOrganization%20of%20American%20States"&gt;Organization of American States (OAS)&lt;/a&gt; Secretary General, and will be in the post within 4 months. He claims to have 17 of the 18 votes needed in order to have the support of a majority within the 34 member states of the OAS.

The post became available after the previous Secretary General, Miguel Ángel Rodriguez, served only 24 days of his term of office, before returning home to Costa Rica to face corruption charges.

The other candidates for the post are ex El Salvadorean president Francisco Flores, Guatemalan Rigoberta Menchú and Chilean Interior Minister José Miguel Insulza.
Meanwhile Francisco Flores is in the Dominican Republic on the beginning of a tour of Caribbean countries drumming up support for his own candidacy. He is being accompanied by El Salvador's deputy foreign minister Margarita Escobar in a clear sign of the importance El Salvador puts on getting their candidate into the job.

&lt;a href="w%3AHonduras"&gt;Honduran&lt;/a&gt; armed forces spokesman Rafael Moreno Coello announced the deployment of 8,000 troops to ensure the peace in the upcoming internal party elections on Feb. 20. The elections will decide who will be nominated as presidential candidates in the two major political parties, the Liberal Party and the National Party. Anyone with the right to vote in Honduras can vote in either election. The Honduran constitution defines the elections, which the Supreme Electoral Tribunal administers.

The troops, who come from all three wings of the Honduran armed forces, are responsible for electoral materials, such as ballot boxes, before, during, and after the election. They will be deployed in all regions of the country. The operation will cost 14 million Lempiras (US$750,000).

Some media sources are reporting that &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; is facing a diplomatic crisis over a number of "Harpy" &lt;a href="w%3AUnmanned%20aerial%20vehicle"&gt;unmanned aerial vehicle&lt;/a&gt;s (UAVs) purchased by the &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; in the 1990s and returned to Israel for upgrades. 

China and the United States are major trading partners with Israel, but discussions to resolve the incident in the Israeli &lt;a href="w%3AKnesset"&gt;Knesset&lt;/a&gt; were muted by a security blackout and delayed by the exit of four Knesset members in protest.

Harry, aged 20, was attending a fancy dress party last weekend when a fellow party-goer photographed him wearing a &lt;a href="w%3Aswastika"&gt;swastika&lt;/a&gt; armband and Nazi insignia on the lapels of his shirt. The photographs were published today by &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Sun"&gt;♡❤The Sun♡❤&lt;/a&gt;, a British tabloid. 

After the picture was published, &lt;a href="w%3AClarence%20House"&gt;Clarence House&lt;/a&gt; (the official residence of Prince Harry) published the following statement: "Prince Harry has apologised for any offence or embarrassment he has caused. He realizes it was a poor choice of costume." Prince Harry himself has made no comments.

Three Palestinian militants attacked the Karni crossing between the Gaza Strip and Israel. The men, each from different Palestinian militant movements (Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, the Popular Resistance Committees, and the military wing of Hamas), used a 200 pound bomb to blast through an iron door that separates the Israeli and Palestinian sides at the checkpoint. They proceeded to throw grenades and fire their assault weapons. All three attackers were shot dead by Israeli soldiers. Early reports indictated three Israelis killed, the final death toll was six Israelis and the three Palestinian attackers.

The attack took place at about 11pm local time.

As a result of the attack, Israel has cut off all links with the newly-elected Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas.

♡❤Wikinews Staff Reports♡❤ – The following stories made international headlines Friday:
<h3>Huygens probe sends first pictures of Titan</h3>
The Cassini-Huygens mission's Huygens probe landed on Saturn's moon Titan and began sending pictures. The first pictures taken during the descent show the probable landing site, and one picture taken after landing shows some ice blocks around the landing area. The images are the first ever taken of the surface of Titan.

<h3>Faint radio signal confirms Huygens Probe has entered Titan's atmosphere</h3>
The Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) in West Virginia, USA, a part of the global network of radio telescopes involved in tracking the Huygens Titan probe, detected the probe's 'carrier' (tone) signal at approximately 10:20 UTC.

<h3>China unveils plans for $242B bridge to Taiwan</h3>
Officials in Beijing plan to build the world's longest bridge to connect Taiwan to mainland China. The US$242 billion roadway may take 20 to 30 years to build.

&lt;a href="w%3AEl%20Salvador"&gt;El Salvador&lt;/a&gt; officially presented ex-president &lt;a href="w%3AFrancisco%20Flores"&gt;Francisco Flores&lt;/a&gt; as its official candidate for the post of Secretary General of the &lt;a href="w%3AOrganization%20of%20American%20States"&gt;Organization of American States (OAS)&lt;/a&gt;. The previous Secretary General, &lt;a href="w%3AMiguel%20%C3%81ngel%20Rodr%C3%ADguez"&gt;Miguel Ángel Rodríguez&lt;/a&gt;, vacated the post after serving only 24 days of his term of office before returning home to &lt;a href="w%3ACosta%20Rica"&gt;Costa Rica&lt;/a&gt; to face corruption charges.

The Salvadoran government claims already to have the support of three other &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20America"&gt;Central-American&lt;/a&gt; countries and the &lt;a href="w%3ADominican%20Republic"&gt;Dominican Republic&lt;/a&gt; for their candidate. This may not be true, however, because &lt;a href="w%3AGuatemala"&gt;Guatemala&lt;/a&gt; is still deciding whether to officially nominate &lt;a href="w%3ANobel%20Peace%20Prize"&gt;Nobel Laureate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ARigoberta%20Mench%C3%BA"&gt;Rigoberta Menchú&lt;/a&gt; as an alternative candidate. It is certain that &lt;a href="w%3AHonduras"&gt;Honduras&lt;/a&gt; is refusing to support Flores because of his refusal to accept the decision of the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Court%20of%20Justice"&gt;International Court of Justice&lt;/a&gt; in favour of Honduras over a territorial dispute between the two nations when he was president.

Flores has criticised &lt;a href="w%3AMexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; for proposing &lt;a href="w%3ALuis%20Ernesto%20Derbez"&gt;Luis Ernesto Derbez&lt;/a&gt; as a candidate, claiming that in the previous election Mexico had agreed, as had all the OAS nations, that the chosen candidate should be from Central America, and that they have gone back on their word by now proposing their own candidate. 

Honduras has similarly criticised Flores, saying that Central America had previously decided to back a consensus candidate, something that Flores is not.

New York – Media giant &lt;a href="w%3AViacom"&gt;Viacom&lt;/a&gt; has delayed the launch of its -themed &lt;a href="w%3ALOGO%20channel"&gt;LOGO channel&lt;/a&gt; by more than four months, according to reports. Originally scheduled to launch Feb. 17, the new channel's debut was delayed until a planned June 30 sign on.

Part of Viacom's &lt;a href="w%3AMTV%20Networks"&gt;MTV Networks&lt;/a&gt;, LOGO has secured carriage on Time Warner cable in Manhattan, RCN and Atlantic Broadband. It is in final negotiations with Comcast, the nation's largest cable company, which serves the San Francisco Bay Area.

The channel's management said it will take the extra time to beef up its programming slate and sign on more carriers. LOGO already has secured the rights to such programming as Golden Globe and Emmy-winning ♡❤Angels in America♡❤ and films such as ♡❤Far From Heaven♡❤, ♡❤Philadelphia♡❤ and ♡❤The Birdcage.♡❤ 

Original programming includes plans for a string of reality-based series and documentaries with titles such as ♡❤The Relationship Show♡❤, ♡❤My Fabulous Gay Wedding♡❤, and ♡❤Cruise♡❤, which take place about a gay-themed ocean cruise ship.

More than 800 homes have been evacuated in the area located below the &lt;a href="w%3APrado%20Dam"&gt;Prado Dam&lt;/a&gt; in the city of Corona, approximately 50 miles east of downtown Los Angeles.

Evacuations began at 5 a.m., with police ordering residents to leave for their own safety. The evacuations also impacted the rush hour commute due a significant amount of people leaving via the already clogged Riverside (91) Freeway.

The record rainfall from the recent storms that pounded &lt;a href="w%3ASouthern%20California"&gt;southern California&lt;/a&gt; has left the earthen dam at its maximum capacity. A small seepage that appeared at the base of the dam raised fears of a possible failure. 

Officials vary on their assessments of the problem. A spokesperson for the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers"&gt;U.S. Army Corps of Engineers&lt;/a&gt;, however, who constructed and maintain the dam, insisted that the problem is trivial and people should be able to return to their homes as early as this evening.

The Prado Dam was constructed in &lt;a href="w%3A1941"&gt;1941&lt;/a&gt; as a flood control dam for &lt;a href="w%3AOrange%20County%2C%20California"&gt;Orange County&lt;/a&gt;. It controls the watershed of the &lt;a href="w%3ASanta%20Ana%20River"&gt;Santa Ana River&lt;/a&gt;, the largest in Southern California.

On Jan. 13, &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; Communications Minister Zhang Chunxian announced a major plan to enlarge the country's freeway system and link all of &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;'s major cities. The project would cost about US$242 billion and take about 25 years to complete, according to &lt;a href="w%3ACNN%20News"&gt;CNN News&lt;/a&gt;. A certain portion of the plans, however, drew scoffs from both the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20of%20China"&gt;Taiwanese government&lt;/a&gt; and the international press&amp;mdash;plans including the construction of a freeway to the island of &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;, over 100 miles away from the &lt;a href="w%3Amainland%20China"&gt;Chinese mainland&lt;/a&gt;. 

The freeway would have to overcome great odds. The length of the freeway, whether a bridge or a tunnel, would have to be much longer than any other in existence. The longest bridge in the world is the &lt;a href="w%3ALake%20Pontchartrain%20Causeway"&gt;Lake Pontchartrain Causeway&lt;/a&gt; in Louisiana, USA, which is 23 miles long. Interestingly enough, the second longest bridge will be the &lt;a href="w%3AHangzhou%20Bay%20Bridge"&gt;Hangzhou Bay Bridge&lt;/a&gt; in China; it will span 22.3 miles when completed in 2008. The longest tunnel in the world is the &lt;a href="w%3ASeikan%20Tunnel"&gt;Seikan Tunnel&lt;/a&gt;, connecting the &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt; islands of &lt;a href="w%3AHonshu"&gt;Honshu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AHokkaido"&gt;Hokkaido&lt;/a&gt; at 33.4 miles.

Besides distance, the bridge would also have to withstand the frequent &lt;a href="w%3ATyphoon"&gt;typhoons&lt;/a&gt; and earthquakes that plague the &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan%20Strait"&gt;Taiwan Strait&lt;/a&gt;. And, according to the Central News Agency (CNA), Taiwan's government funded news service, building a freeway across the strait would cause problems with the area's "Black Tides" and "marine trench". 

The biggest obstacles to building the bridge, however, may not be with nature, but rather with politics. The Beijing and Taipei governments do not maintain any official ties. Beijing claims Taiwan as part of its territory and breaks off political ties with any country that maintains political ties with Taipei. The PRC has even threatened to attack Taiwan if the island declares formal &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan%20independence"&gt;independence&lt;/a&gt;.

Currently it is not possible to travel directly from Taiwan to mainland China or vice versa; Taiwanese flights to and from mainland China are detoured through a third-party airport, usually &lt;a href="w%3AHong%20Kong"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt;, before continuing on. In spite of this, the announcement came at a time when representatives from Taiwan and mainland China are discussing possible direct flights&amp;mdash;at least for the &lt;a href="w%3AChinese%20New%20Year"&gt;Chinese New Year&lt;/a&gt;.

Taiwanese leaders dismissed the announcement as propaganda. It was undoubtably seen by a few Taiwanese as an attempt on the People's Republic of China's part to annex the island.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADrygalski%20Ice%20Tongue"&gt;Drygalski Ice Tongue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on &lt;a href="Antarctica"&gt;Antarctica&lt;/a&gt;'s coastline may be bitten off this week by a huge iceberg which is on a collision course with the floating glacier tongue.

Antarctic scientists, at the nearby &lt;a href="McMurdo%20Research%20Station"&gt;McMurdo Research Station&lt;/a&gt;, are watching the movement of iceberg B15A, a remnant of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARoss%20Ice%20Shelf"&gt;Ross Ice Shelf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which partially broke apart five years ago. 

The 100-&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Amile"&gt;mile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -long, 1,200 square mile iceberg is affecting wildlife in the area &amp;ndash; particularly that of penguins, which are in their breeding season. &lt;a href="Biology"&gt;Biologists&lt;/a&gt; fear that if the berg hits the ice tongue and sticks to it, the resulting dam will make it impossible for adult penguins to reach their hunting ground without abandoning their newborn chicks.

If iceberg B15A doesn't stick to the Drygalski Ice Tongue, scientists are considering other possible outcomes:

<ul>
BULLET::::- The two massive ice bodies could collide explosively, then bounce away from each other, like a giant pinball-type bumper.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- The Drygalski Ice Tongue could break off from the Antarctic coast to form another huge iceberg.

</ul>
Iceberg B15A's speed is subject to the local tides, which may guide the berg to hit more than once, according to researcher Robert Bindshadler, who works at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.

"It's a clash of the titans, a radical and uncommon event," said Bindshadler.

&lt;a href="w%3AHuygens%20probe"&gt;Huygens&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;an built &lt;a href="w%3ATitan%20%28moon%29"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; exploration probe, ended its seven-year voyage today when it landed on the surface of the second largest moon in the solar system at 11:38 a.m. UTC. The probe, which the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Space%20Agency"&gt;European Space Agency&lt;/a&gt; (ESA) began developing 17 years ago, has worked well with only minor system failures.

"This is a great achievement for Europe and its US partners in
this ambitious international endeavor to explore the
Saturnian system", said Jean-Jacques Dordain, the Director General of the ESA &lt;a href="http%3A//www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Cassini-Huygens/SEMQ1QQ3K3E_0.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The first confirmation that Huygens had successfully entered Titan's thick atmosphere was at 10:25 a.m. UTC when the Green Bank radio telescope in the United States directly received the faint carrier signal of its beacon. Due to the immense distance, the radio transmission took 67 minutes to arrive.

Huygens broadcast data to its &lt;a href="w%3ACassini-Huygens"&gt;Cassini&lt;/a&gt; mothership (the US probe which carried Huygens to Titan) throughout its descent and then from the surface. After Cassini dropped below the horizon of Titan (cutting the radio link), Cassini turned towards Earth to begin transmitting its recording of the Huygens data to the &lt;a href="w%3AESOC"&gt;European Space Operations Centre&lt;/a&gt; in Darmstadt, Germany.

So far, ESA has released least three pictures&amp;mdash;two from the probe's descent through the atmosphere under parachutes and then a picture near the surface. The Huygens probe took a total of over 300 black and white photographs during its brief mission.

"The Huygens scientists are all delighted. This was worth the long
wait," says Dr Jean-Pierre Lebreton, ESA Huygens Mission Manager.
&lt;a href="http%3A//www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Cassini-Huygens/SEMQ1QQ3K3E_0.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The Cassini-Huygens mission is conducted by an alliance between &lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;, 
the ESA, and &lt;a href="w%3AItalian%20Space%20Agency"&gt;ASI&lt;/a&gt;, the Italian space agency. The NASA &lt;a href="w%3AJet%20Propulsion%20Laboratory"&gt;Jet Propulsion Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; designed, developed and assembled the Cassini orbiter.

TEXAS, US – 
A United States Army court martial found Army Spc. Charles Graner guilty of abusing prisoners at Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison. The jury sentenced Graner to ten years in prison.

Graner, 36, was described as the ringleader during his four-day trial before a military jury. He was accused of assaulting prisoners for fun.

He pleaded innocent to the five charges brought against him, but the ten person jury took five hours to find him guilty.

During the trial, video and photographs taken inside the prison in November 2003 were presented to the court. The photographs were made public in early 2004 bringing the world's attention to the abuses going on in the prison. 

It is alleged that senior US defence officials knew of the abuse, including the Secretary of Defence, Donald Rumsfeld. Garner's defense maintained that he was acting under orders to 'soften up' detainees before interrogation.

The Northern European country of &lt;a href="w%3AFinland"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt; was named among the world's most healthy, according to an investigation by the London-based newspaper, ♡❤The Guardian♡❤. According to health experts, Finland joins &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; as having the distinction of being home to the lowest percentage of "&lt;a href="w%3Acouch%20potato"&gt;couch potato&lt;/a&gt;" citizens among developed nations.

Pekka Puska, Director of Finland's National Institute of Public Health claimed that in the 1970s, the country held the world record for &lt;a href="w%3AHeart%20disease"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;. "Finnish men used to say that &lt;a href="w%3AVegetable"&gt;vegetables&lt;/a&gt; were for &lt;a href="w%3ARabbit"&gt;rabbits&lt;/a&gt; and not for men," he said, "and the staple foods were bread and butter, fatty meat and full-fat milk!"

When the Finnish government found out the figures in the 1970s, it began a &lt;a href="w%3ACampaign"&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt; to make a healthier nation. The number of males dying of heart problems has, over the past 35 years, decreased by 65 percent, and lung cancer deaths have also dropped dramatically.

Other nations are now considering using similar tactics as the Finnish government to make their own countries more healthy, but some say it is yet another example of a "nanny state."

Just seven days after the election of the new Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has ordered his military today to perform a new crackdown on Palestinian militants in resonse to another set of attacks on Israelis.

Now Sharon has told his military to "take any action needed without restriction". Sharon said: "Despite the change in Palestinian leadership, we have yet to see them taking any action against terror."

This follows Thursday's killing of six Israelis in an attack on a Gaza Strip crossing point. As a result, the Israeli government cut all communications with Abbas.

Yesterday Palestinians fired rockets into Israeli territory, injuring two people. 
In response, Israeli troops mounted raids into the Gaza Strip, killing eight Palestinian terrorists.

Mahmoud Abbas was elected on a platform of curbing the activities of the terrorists and pursuing peace with Israel.

A delegation of Brazilian deputies and senators met the new president of the Palestine Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, known as Abu Mazen, on Monday, January 10. &lt;a href="w%3AAbbas"&gt;Abbas&lt;/a&gt; recognized the preferential treatment offered by Brazil to the Palestinians and promised reciprocity. Carlos Abicalil (PT) , member of the delegation, said that the decision of the Brazilian President &lt;a href="w%3ALuiz%20In%C3%A1cio%20Lula%20da%20Silva"&gt;Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva&lt;/a&gt; to establish, in July 2004, an office of representation in &lt;a href="w%3ARamallah"&gt;Ramallah&lt;/a&gt; contributed to the closening of relations between the governments of Brazil and the &lt;a href="w%3APalestinian"&gt;Palestinian&lt;/a&gt;. 

He praised the choice of Abbas, remembering that the election of the parliament, in July, can be a still more decisive step: "From the point of view of the major political representation of the parliament, there is still an incognito, since diverse political positions which didn't participate in the presidential election, with proper candidates, as is the case with Hamas - who have an armed and very organized arm - will participate in the legislative elections. Evidently, in the composition of the parliament, there will be more or less radical positions around the situation of Gaza and Jerusalem ".

Jeff Tweiten, a 27-year-old graphic artist, is encamped in front of the Cinerama Theatre, on a blue sofa, in the northwest city of Seattle, Washington. Tweiten plans to wait 139 days for the premiere of "Star Wars: Episode III &amp;mdash; Revenge of the Sith," which opens May 19, 2005.

He has received help from a community of friends and local business people who have supplied changes of clothes, coffee, food, and a nearby restroom.

City authorities have chosen not to enforce vagrancy laws that would force Tweiten to move between the hours of 7AM and 9PM local time.

Tweiten also camped out for the previous two episodes of the Star Wars movies, "Episode I" and "Episode II".

&lt;a href="w%3AEast%20China%20Sea"&gt;East China Sea&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; plans to deploy 55,000 troops, along with planes, warships, and submarines, in the event of a &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; invasion of a remote southern island chain.

This new policy contrasts sharply with public comments by Japan's &lt;a href="w%3AChief%20Cabinet%20Secretary"&gt;Chief Cabinet Secretary&lt;/a&gt; Hiroyuki Hosoda, who as recently as December claimed that Japan did not view China as a threat.

&lt;a href="w%3ADefense%20Agency%20%28Japan%29"&gt;Japan Defense Agency&lt;/a&gt; Director General Yoshinori Ono pointed to an incursion into the area by a Chinese nuclear submarine last November, which has raised the profile of the political dispute over administrative rights for the islands. China has also increased its marine surveillance of the area in recent months.

The release of such detailed plans by the Japan Defense Agency sends a strong message to China&amp;mdash;that Japan plans to protect its claimed administrative rights over the area at all costs. Many Japanese believe "that their government should take an even tougher stance toward China", according to Ho Szu-shen, an associate professor in the Department of Japanese at Fu-jen Catholic University. 

The Chinese government has not yet commented publicly about the release of the Japanese defense plans for the islands. However, in December, the state-run &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Daily"&gt;People's Daily&lt;/a&gt; newspaper editorialized that Japan's multi-year Defense Forces Reorganization Plan attempts to "play up Chinese military threats." China is also unhappy with Japan's plans to build a missile defense system in cooperation with the United States.

Sovereignty of the island is disputed between Japan and China. Both the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China claims soveregnty on the island.

Despite Japan's claims of &lt;a href="w%3ASovereignty"&gt;sovereignty&lt;/a&gt; over the islands, China has begun to claim some of the region's valuable oil and natural gas deposits to help alleviate the shortages for China's growing economy. China recently allowed leased oil drilling to commence within the area that Japan has declared as an "Economic Exclusion Zone". Japan has lodged diplomatic protests to ask China to discontinue these projects, but China does not recognize Japan's claims, arguing that Chinese territorial rights end at the edge of the Asian &lt;a href="w%3AContinental%20shelf"&gt;continental shelf&lt;/a&gt; underneath the &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20China%20Sea"&gt;East China Sea&lt;/a&gt;.

On March 24, 2004, seven Chinese activists were arrested by Japanese authorities when they landed on the islands with the intent to stay for three days. At the time, the &lt;a href="w%3AMinistry%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%20%28Japan%29"&gt;Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs&lt;/a&gt; lodged a protest with the PRC. The activists were deported by Japan after the PRC demanded their return.

The name of the island chain is disputed. The Japanese refer to the islands as "Sento Shosho" or "Senkaku Retto," the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Republic of China (Taiwan) call the island the same name. In PRC's pinyin system, the names spells "Diaoyu Dao" and in ROC's system "Tiao Yu Tai."

Zhao Ziyang, the &lt;a href="w%3AGeneral%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Communist%20Party%20of%20China"&gt;General Secretary&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3ACommunist%20Party%20of%20China"&gt;Chinese Communist Party&lt;/a&gt; who was purged for sympathizing with the student protestors in the &lt;a href="w%3ATiananmen%20Square%20protests%20of%201989"&gt;Tiananmen Square protests of 1989&lt;/a&gt; died on Monday in &lt;a href="w%3ABeijing"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt; after 15 years of house arrest. He was 85.

Zhao was a reformer within the communist party who acted against corruption, and created programs of economic and agricultural reform that allowed parts of China to recover from the failure and famine of the &lt;a href="w%3AGreat%20Leap%20Forward"&gt;Great Leap Forward&lt;/a&gt;. He disbanded communes and allowed farmers to tend their own land; he also introduced the plan to create special economic hubs in coastal areas &amp;mdash; a system that is the current model for China.

In the 1980s, Zhao's success gained him a variety of top posts within the Poliburo of the Communist Party, including in 1987 the post of General Secretary &amp;mdash; highest rank within the party. He was seen by outsiders as a potential successor to the de facto Chinese leader &lt;a href="w%3ADeng%20Xiaoping"&gt;Deng Xiaoping&lt;/a&gt;, though on one occasion Zhao had denied that he would be fit for the role.

Zhao's rule came to an end in 1989, as he sided with the &lt;a href="w%3ATiananmen%20Square%20protests%20of%201989"&gt;student protesters advocating democracy&lt;/a&gt; in the Tiananmen Square in Beijing. Zhao's position was not held by others within the core of the Politburo, and he was stripped of his post. 

On May 19, 1989, Zhao arrived at Tiananmen Square and spoke to the protesters. In tears, he apologized for "coming too late" and asked them to abandon their protest.

Shortly afterward, Zhao was placed under house arrest despite never being charged. Two weeks later on June 4, the army was sent into the square to disband the protestors, leading to hundreds of deaths.

He never again made a public appearance and was confined to a courtyard house not far from Tiananmen Square. From there, Mr. Zhao ventured outside only rarely and under heavy escort to play golf at nearby courses.

Even in death, the government continues to fear that his name might ignite discontent among impoverished farmers, intellectuals, the unemployed and others who want to see sweeping political reforms.

Security at Tiananmen Square was visibly tightened in the days leading to Zhao Ziyang's death, as reports emerged that he had slipped into a coma. 

Official announcement of his passing Monday came via a short dispatch by the state news agency, which briefly said that he had died at a Beijing hospital after suffering longtime lung and heart ailments. The report referred to the deceased leader as "Comrade Zhao" and made no mention of his former titles.

He had been in a coma since Friday after suffering multiple strokes, a source close to his family said.

He is survived by his second wife, Liang Boqi, four sons, and a daughter.

By defining these as military missions, the Bush administration hopes to evade legal restrictions imposed on the &lt;a href="CIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt;'s covert activities overseas.

There are &lt;a href="http%3A//archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/meast/12/12/iran.nuclear/"&gt;satellite photographs&lt;/a&gt; showing disputed nuclear facilities near &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANatanz"&gt;Natanz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AArak"&gt;Arak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Atomic%20Energy%20Authority"&gt;International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; inspected these sites in early 2002 without finding conclusive evidence of military use, though traces of highly enriched material were found.

The covert missions have been ongoing for nearly a year, and have taken place in as many as ten Middle Eastern and South Asian nations. In return for his country's assistance, &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;i President &lt;a href="Pervez%20Musharraf"&gt;Pervez Musharraf&lt;/a&gt; is said to have received assurances that the US government will not demand for questioning &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAbdul%20Qadeer%20Khan"&gt;Abdul Qadeer Khan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Pakistani nuclear scientist and creator of their &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aatom%20bomb"&gt;nuclear bomb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The Pentagon has strongly criticised the report, though without explicitly denying the existence of covert operations in Iran. According to the Pentagon spokesman "Mr. Hersh's article is so riddled with errors of fundamental fact that the credibility of his entire piece is destroyed."

He went on to state: "Mr. Hersh's source(s) feed him with rumor, innuendo, and assertions about meetings that never happened, programs that do not exist, and statements by officials that were never made."

&lt;a href="NASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;'s Phoenix Mars Lander program now has an official web site.

The mission of the robotic craft, scheduled to launch August 2007, is to explore the northern polar region of Mars (about 70° N latitude) in May 2008 and to expose the upper few feet of surface material using a robotic arm to find the ice that was discovered by the
&lt;a href="w%3A2001%20Mars%20Odyssey"&gt;Odyssey&lt;/a&gt; mission in 2002.

The Phoenix lander is the first in NASA's new line of smaller "Scout" missions in the agency's Mars Exploration Program.

♡❤Wikinews Staff Reports♡❤ – The following stories made international headlines Monday
<h3>Catholic archbishop kidnapped in Iraq</h3>
A &lt;a href="w%3ACatholic"&gt;Catholic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aarchbishop"&gt;archbishop&lt;/a&gt; was kidnapped in &lt;a href="w%3AMosul%2C%20Iraq"&gt;Mosul, Iraq&lt;/a&gt; according to reports from the &lt;a href="w%3AVatican"&gt;Vatican&lt;/a&gt;. The man, Basile Georges Casmoussa, is an archbishop of the Syrian Catholic Church, and was in Mosul &amp;mdash; a city with tens of thousands of Christians that make up 3 percent of the country's population. The Vatican called the kidnapping a terrorist act. 

<h3>80 government officials convicted in Chinese bank swindle</h3>
After an investigation that lasted for more than a year the National Audit Office of &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; found 233 persons, including 80 government officials, guilty of having defrauded the &lt;a href="w%3A%20Industrial%20and%20Commercial%20Bank%20of%20China"&gt;Industrial and Commercial Bank of China&lt;/a&gt; (ICBC), China's largest commercial bank. The total amount involved in the swindle was 7.4 billion yuan (US$894 million). Most of the money appears to have been recovered, but more than 2 billion yuan are still missing and may have been transferred to overseas accounts.

<h3>Bosnian Serb colonel convicted of genocide for Srebrenica massacre</h3>
The former commander of the Bratunac Brigade in Bosnia, &lt;a href="w%3AVidoje%20Blagojevic"&gt;Vidoje Blagojevic&lt;/a&gt;, was sentenced to 18 years' imprisonment by the Hague Tribunal for "complicity in genocide". The Trial Chamber found that Blagojevic's brigade, by taking part in the forced transfer of &lt;a href="w%3ABosniaks"&gt;Bosniaks&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="w%3ASrebenica"&gt;Srebenica&lt;/a&gt; area, had aided and abetted a "murder operation" that led to the death of more than 7000 men and boys.

Blagojevic was the second person from former Yugoslavia to be found guilty of genocide by the Tribunal. The first was &lt;a href="w%3ARadislav%20Krstic"&gt;Radislav Krstic&lt;/a&gt;, the Bosnian Serb general who led the Srebrenica operation. Krstic was sentenced to 46 years' imprisonment on 2 August 2001.

<h3>Eight workers paralyzed from toxic chemical in S. Korean sweatshop</h3>
Eight Thai female workers, working for the South Korean company ♡❤Donghwa Digital♡❤, were paralyzed from the waist down after being exposed to &lt;a href="w%3Ahexane"&gt;hexane&lt;/a&gt;, a chemical commonly used by the electronics industry to clean electronic components.

Workers at Donghwa used hexane to polish products in unventilated rooms, for up to 12 hours per day. They worked without protective gear, such as gloves, goggles, and masks, for varying durations of time, between seven months and three years.

Of the eight women from Thailand, seven were illegal migrant workers who were afraid to seek outside help due to their fear of deportation. After a Seoul newspaper reported about the women on Friday, the South Korean Ministry of Labor initiated an investigation of Donghwa Digital.

The Seoul newspaper, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.hani.co.kr/"&gt;♡❤Hankyoreh Sinmun♡❤&lt;/a&gt;, also reported on an earlier similar case involving three Chinese women who worked for another company making components for liquid crystal displays.

A 66 year-old woman in &lt;a href="w%3ABucharest"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt; has given birth to a girl and is believed to be the oldest woman ever to give birth.

She had been receiving fertility treatment for nine years before conceiving twins. She had not been able to conceive naturally before.

The baby was delivered early by Caesarean section after the other fetus died in the womb. At birth, the child weighed 1.4kg.

The government of &lt;a href="Colombia"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt; released an official notice in response to &lt;a href="Venezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;'s 
claims. Recently Venezuela said Colombian authorities illegally invaded Venezuelan
territory and kidnapped &lt;a href="w%3AFARC"&gt;FARC&lt;/a&gt; adviser Rodrigo Granda (also known as Ricardo Gonzalez). Colombia said that Colombian forces captured Granda inside Colombian territory. Colombia also accused Venezuela of harboring terrorists.

At first, Venezuela accused Colombia of invading Venezuelan territory and capturing Granda. Later, Venezuela said that Colombia may have bribed Venezuelan public officers.

The Venezuelan government's protests are a request of the FARC. The FARC demands that the Venezuelan government assures the safety and freedom of their members inside Venezuelan territory.

The complete Colombian declaration follows:

Waukesha County, Wisconsin, Martin Luther King Day. The Waukesha Freeman, a newspaper with roots in the Abolitionist Movement before the American Civil War, announced that the Wisconsin Department of Transportation has deemed a house at Highway 164 and Lisbon Road of no historical value, and has authorized its demolition sometime this spring.

A historian in the town of Sussex, Wisconsin, where the house is located, noted that residents had a verbal tradition that it was a location in the Underground Railroad, a route for slaves to Canada, before the American Civil War. 

Sue Baker, of the Waukesha County Historical Society, which has a museum of county history in the old Court House, noted that Waukesha County had strong abolitionist leanings.

Ironically, Waukesha County, due to its high house prices, compared to Milwaukee County, has relatively few African-American residents, and statistically, the Milwaukee metropolitan area is one of the most segregated in the United States.

A 38 year-old man has been arrested by the Customs and Excise Department of &lt;a href="Hong%20Kong"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt;, for illegally distributing three copyrighted movies via &lt;a href="w%3ABitTorrent"&gt;BitTorrent&lt;/a&gt; file-sharing technology. This is the world's first &lt;a href="w%3Acriminal%20law"&gt;criminal&lt;/a&gt; arrest of its kind.

The unemployed male was arrested last Thursday for uploading "&lt;a href="w%3Atorrent"&gt;torrents&lt;/a&gt;" to a local message board. The torrents allowed people to download three movies from computers at his home in Tuen Mun, Hong Kong. However, the suspect was not immediately charged, and investigations are still underway, according to the Hong Kong Government. The law in Hong Kong allows for a sentence of up to four years in prison, and a US$6,400 fine per violation &amp;mdash; defined as a single unauthorized copy of a protected work.

BitTorrent is an ultra-fast file-sharing technology which allows users (or "peers") to share files of any size via the unused &lt;a href="w%3Aupload"&gt;upload&lt;/a&gt; bandwidth of other peers, even though their downloads are still in progress. The technology was developed by &lt;a href="w%3ABram%20Cohen"&gt;Bram Cohen&lt;/a&gt; three years ago.

In the past several weeks, major BitTorrent websites in the United States have closed down due to, or in order to avoid &lt;a href="w%3Acivil%20law"&gt;civil&lt;/a&gt; charges initiated recently by the &lt;a href="w%3AMPAA"&gt;MPAA&lt;/a&gt;. According to the former operator of one of these sites, &lt;a href="w%3ASuprnova.org"&gt;Suprnova.org&lt;/a&gt;, software developers have already worked out a solution and are beta-testing a new peer-to-peer program called &lt;a href="w%3AeXeem"&gt;eXeem&lt;/a&gt;. The software will bring together the strengths of &lt;a href="w%3AKazaa"&gt;Kazaa&lt;/a&gt; (another &lt;a href="w%3Apeer-to-peer"&gt;peer-to-peer&lt;/a&gt; program) and BitTorrent.

The country, a &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AUnited%20States%20of%20America"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; ally and a member of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ANATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; since 2004, already has 730 troops in Iraq, being the 8th largest force in the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ACoalition%20of%20the%20willing"&gt;coalition of the willing&lt;/a&gt;. The additional deployment will make Romania's force the 7th largest in Iraq, raising its number to 830 troops. 

These announcements come amid the global trend of military withdrawal from Iraq. &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASpain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; pulled its troops out in early 2004 following a change of government, while Romania's neighbours &lt;a href="%3Aw%3APoland"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AHungary"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABulgaria"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt;, also staunch US allies, are planning a reduction in the number of troops in the coming year.

This news also comes at a time when the USA is planning to move its European troops from bases in Germany to more eastern locations. The most likely candidates are Romania and Bulgaria, which are in strategic positions close to the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AMiddle%20East"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt;.

AUSTRALIA – Following hospitalisation for &lt;a href="w%3APancreatitis"&gt;pancreatitis&lt;/a&gt; and ongoing speculation about his leadership, &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Latham"&gt;Mark Latham&lt;/a&gt; has resigned from his roles as leader of the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Australian Labor Party (ALP)&lt;/a&gt; and also the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;Federal Member&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="w%3AWerriwa"&gt;Werriwa&lt;/a&gt;. He cited as reasons the media harassment, and a desire to put his family and health first.

Mr Latham became leader of the ALP just over a year ago, on &lt;a href="w%3A2%20December"&gt;2 December&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3A2003"&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt;, leading the party during the October 2004 federal election. He was hospitalised in the run-up to that election, also for treatment of pancreatitis. Following the defeat of his party, his leadership increasingly came under question.

He fell ill a second time almost simultaneously with last year's &lt;a href="2004%20Indian%20Ocean%20Tsunami"&gt;Indian Ocean tsunami disaster&lt;/a&gt;. His failure to issue a statement on the tsunami drew criticism from the media and calls for his resignation from within his own party, even after it was revealed that he had been incapacitated at the time.

Mr Latham's resignation sidesteps the possibility of a leadership challenge by other members of the party and leaves no clear successor.

Băsescu was elected president of Romania in December 12, 2004, in the country's most hotly-contested election since the downfall of the Communist Party in 1989.

The president met with Quinton Quayle, the UK's ambassador in Bucharest, Romania, where he received Mr Blair's invitation. In &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, Băsescu will discuss the strong cooperation between the UK and Romania in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as the British support that Romania receives in its fight against corruption and its preparation for EU accession. Romania is expected to join the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; in 2007.

Băsescu is also expected to discuss regional security in the Black Sea area, an important issue of his presidency, as well as to meet British businessmen interested in investing in Romania. The United Kingdom has been one of the largest foreign investors in Romania and continues to invest significantly in the country, which is attractive due to its low labour costs, which are lower than those in the new Central European member states. Foreign investment is expected to increase significantly this year due to Romania's new fiscal policy, which introduced a flat tax rate of 16%, the lowest among EU member states and candidates.

After winning the presidential elections, Băsescu was criticised by many for his outspoken support for his plan to create a ♡❤Bucharest-London-New York axis♡❤, a partnership between Romania, the UK and the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AUnited%20States%20of%20America"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt;. Băsescu later backed down on his claims, though he said that the UK and the US remain of great interest to Romania for reasons of security. Romania remains a staunch supporter of the US- and UK-led invasion and occupation of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;.

A new report by the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Federation%20of%20Journalists"&gt;International Federation of Journalists (IFJ)&lt;/a&gt; documents 129 cases where media workers have been killed because of their work during 2004. They expect the number to increase as more information reaches them. This could make 2004 the deadliest year ever.

49 casualties (close to 40%) occurred in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, making it by far the deadliest country for journalists. At least 20 of those appeared to be cases were journalists were directly targeted because of their profession.

Another country that deserved special attention was the &lt;a href="w%3APhilippines"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt; where 13 journalists appears to have been asassinated in separate incidents because of their reporting. None of the murderes have been apprehended by the police. 

In &lt;a href="w%3ANepal"&gt;Nepal&lt;/a&gt; two journalists were killed by security forces and one by the rebels. Another journalist was killed by land mines.

The ten-hour telethon was organised on Sunday, January 16, by the television station Realitatea TV, and was the first time an event of this kind had been staged in the country. Nicoleta Drăguşin, a spokeswoman for the network, claims that, "it was a big success... [15 billion lei] is a lot of money for a private television station to raise."

Dozens of Romanian celebrities took part in the telethon, including goalkeeper Bogdan Stelea, fashion designers Catinca Roman and Mihai Albu, former Foreign Affairs Minister &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AMircea%20Geoana"&gt;Mircea Geoană&lt;/a&gt; and the soprano Mariana Nicolesco. Newly-elected president &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ATraian%20Basescu"&gt;Traian Băsescu&lt;/a&gt; and prime minister &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ACalin%20Popescu-Tariceanu"&gt;Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu&lt;/a&gt; also took part. In between the live showings of celebrities picking up calls from Romanians who had called to donate, there were shown images and footage from the global catastrophe and its aftermath.

Two Romanian tourists have been declared missing in the tsunami. The 395,000 euro raised by the telethon supplement that 150,000 euro worth of aid pledged by the Romanian government in the form of tents, water and drugs to tsunami-stricken areas of South Asia.

&lt;a href="w%3AToulouse%2C%20France"&gt;Toulouse, FRANCE&lt;/a&gt; – In a ceremony attended by several European political leaders and 5,000 VIP guests, &lt;a href="w%3AAirbus"&gt;Airbus&lt;/a&gt; unveiled plans for the &lt;a href="w%3AA380"&gt;A380&lt;/a&gt;, a twin-deck aircraft that can carry up to 840 people in all-economy class (550 for a Boeing 747), or 555 people in typical three mixed classes layout.

The new aircraft will take the world's-largest title away from rival &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20747"&gt;Boeing's 747&lt;/a&gt;. Boeing's upcoming new design, the 7e7, does not attempt to compete directly with the A380 but instead is aimed at a more efficient and comfortable flight at 200-250 seats.

Airbus chief executive Noel Forgeard stated that he expected sales of the aircraft to exceed the 250 required for the project to break even. To date, 149 confirmed orders for the aircraft have been received. Airbus has hopes that sales will exceed 700. The company is currently in talks with China regarding possible sales there.

The first test flight of the aircraft may take place as early as March, and the first commercial flight is expected to take off in mid-2006 from Singapore's &lt;a href="w%3AChangi%20Airport"&gt;Changi Airport&lt;/a&gt;.

British and American airline &lt;a href="w%3AVirgin%20Atlantic"&gt;Virgin Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; has purchased six of these aeroplanes and intend to fit them with gyms and bars as well as seats.

&lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; – 

The &lt;a href="w%3ASyria"&gt;Syrian&lt;/a&gt; Catholic archbishop of &lt;a href="w%3AMosul"&gt;Mosul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABasile%20Georges%20Casmoussa"&gt;Basile Georges Casmoussa&lt;/a&gt;, aged 66, who was abducted by unidentified gunmen yesterday afternoon, was released earlier today and is now back in his home.

According to Father Dwraid Brbar of the Mosul diocese, the abductors probably took the wrong person. They were not aware that he was an archbishop. "Initially they asked for a ransom, but when they realised that they had taken a member of the Catholic Church they released him without demanding money".

Casmoussa was born in Iraq and has been archbishop of the Syrian Catholic rite in Mosul since 1999.

&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; – 

A British minister in the &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20for%20International%20Development"&gt;Department for International Development&lt;/a&gt; says that a second &lt;a href="w%3ATsunami"&gt;tsunami&lt;/a&gt; could hit South-East Asia within the next 50 years.

&lt;a href="w%3AGareth%20Thomas%20%28English%20politician%29"&gt;Gareth Thomas&lt;/a&gt; warned world leaders at a natural disasters conference in the &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href="w%3AKobe"&gt;Kobe&lt;/a&gt;. The conference was called to discuss the feasibility of an early warning system for tsunamis to be set up in the &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Ocean"&gt;Indian Ocean&lt;/a&gt;.

He told a &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; radio program earlier today that such a system would cost £20 to £30 million pounds. There is a similar system in the &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Ocean"&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AJunichiro%20Koizumi"&gt;Junichiro Koizumi&lt;/a&gt;, the Japanese Prime Minister, said that Japan would provide technical support for the system. "The system needs to be rapidly developed," he told the conference.

The World Conference on Disaster Reduction in Kobe, being held only 10 years after the &lt;a href="w%3AEarthquake"&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt; that destroyed the city, began with a silent tribute to those who lost their lives in the tsunami.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; Emergency Co-ordinator, &lt;a href="w%3AJan%20Egeland"&gt;Jan Egeland&lt;/a&gt;, said, "I hope that nations will make a strong commitment to establishing a system in the Indian Ocean that will help vulnerable populations within the next ten years."

He also added that the system would remove danger: disasters will still happen, but forewarned is forearmed.

&lt;a href="w%3AChile"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt;'s Interior Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9%20Miguel%20Insulza"&gt;José Miguel Insulza&lt;/a&gt; said that he is convinced that he has enough support to become the next Secretary General of the &lt;a href="w%3AOrganization%20of%20American%20States"&gt;Organization of American States (OAS)&lt;/a&gt;, and that he sees himself as a consensus candidate.

Speaking in &lt;a href="w%3ABrasilia"&gt;Brasilia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;, he claimed to have the support of &lt;a href="w%3AVenezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt; after meeting President &lt;a href="w%3AHugo%20Chavez"&gt;Hugo Chavez&lt;/a&gt; last Friday. He already has the support of &lt;a href="w%3AArgentina"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt; and Brazil. He is the more left-wing of the three officially declared candidates, the other two being &lt;a href="w%3AEl%20Salvador"&gt;El Salvador&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AFrancisco%20Flores"&gt;Francisco Flores&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ALuis%20Ernesto%20Derbez"&gt;Luis Ernesto Derbez&lt;/a&gt;, so it comes as no surprise that he has the support of other South American left-wing governments.

It remains to be seen whether he can gain consensus of the member states. It is Francisco Flores who has the important support of the &lt;a href="w%3AUSA"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt;, though some see this as a disadvantage.

&lt;a href="w%3ANairobi"&gt;Nairobi&lt;/a&gt; – Five of the last remaining northern &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20Rhinoceros"&gt;white rhinos&lt;/a&gt; in the wild will be airlifted from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to Kenya in coming weeks. This is a desperate move to save the population from extinction. 

In 2003, about 30 rhinos lived in &lt;a href="w%3AGaramba%20National%20Park"&gt;Garamba National Park&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, heavily-armed poaching gangs have slaughtered around 20 of these animals. Kes Hillman Smith of the Rhino Project at &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Rhino%20Foundation"&gt;International Rhino Foundation (IRF)&lt;/a&gt; now believes there are fewer than 10 animals left in the park.

Sometime before the rainy season begins in February, the rhinos will be flown by military transport plane or helicopter to a private reserve in central Kenya.

Outside of the Garamba National Park, there are also 10 northern white rhinos in captivity. However, it is very difficult to breed them in captivity.

Trade in rhino horn has been banned internationally since 1977, but it is worth more than $1200 (USD) per kilogram on the black market.

The following stories made international headlines Tuesday:

<h3>Rice details plans as head of U.S. State Dept.</h3>
At her confirmation hearings to be appointed the next U.S. Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice said she is committed to mending international relations and to continued troop support in Iraq.

<h3>Eight Chinese abducted in Iraq</h3>
Eight Chinese construction workers have been kidnapped. The kidnappers are demanding that the Chinese government reassure that it will not allow its citizens to work for Americans in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. They have threatened to execute the hostages in 48 hours if China fails to comply. &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; has long objected to the last US-led Iraq war, which ended with the capture of &lt;a href="w%3ASaddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt;, the former Iraqi president.

<h3>Hajj attracts thousands of Muslims</h3>
Mina, Saudi Arabia, was witness to thousands of pilgrims in a hajj celebrating the life of the 7th century prophet Muhammad. They stopped in Mina before heading on to Mount Arafat as part of a five-day cycle of prayer. Government officials set up more than 40 thousand fire-proof tents in Mina to temporarily house the pilgrims.

<h3>World's oldest mother gives birth to twins, one dies</h3>
In Bucharest, Romania, a 66-year-old woman who was impregnated via in vitro fertilization gave birth to a 1.4 kilogram (3.1 pound) baby girl through caesarean section. A twin died. Romania has no age limit on in vitro fertilization.

<h1>First ever corruption conviction of public official in Honduras</h1>
&lt;a href="w%3ADante%20Gabriel%20Ram%C3%ADrez%20Erazo"&gt;Dante Gabriel Ramírez Erazo&lt;/a&gt;, who was Director of Roads in &lt;a href="w%3AHonduras"&gt;Honduras&lt;/a&gt; between 1994 and 1998, was yesterday found guilty of illegal enrichment by stealing 967,892 Lempiras ($US51,000) during his two years in this office. This is the first time a public official has been found guilty of this type of offence in Honduras. He will be sentenced on February 15th. Although the sentence is from 3 to 5 years, he may be able to pay a fine instead. He also has the possibility of appealing to the Supreme Court of Justice, something he may well do as he maintains his innocence. He is not in prison at the moment, but he cannot leave Honduras and he has to report to the judges on a weekly basis.
Part of the prosecution case against him was his ownership of a house worth 1,350,000 Lempiras ($US72,000).

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStockholm"&gt;Stockholm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; – 
A well-known &lt;a href="Sweden"&gt;Swedish&lt;/a&gt; doctor and researcher at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGothenburg%20University"&gt;Gothenburg University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has been prosecuted, together with the Vice-Chancellor and the President of the University Council, for failing to hand over sensitive data on patients to outside critics.

The ♡❤Parliamentary Ombudsman♡❤, an official appointed by the Parliament, decided to press charges against Professor &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChristopher%20Gillberg"&gt;Christopher Gillberg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , MD, Professor &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGunnar%20Svedberg"&gt;Gunnar Svedberg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , (Vice-Chancellor) and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AArne%20Wittl%C3%B6v"&gt;Arne Wittlöv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (President), for failing to comply with a court order from February 2003.

The court had ordered Gillberg and his colleagues to hand over sensitive data on patients and their relatives to two critics of their research: Eva Kärfve, a sociologist, and Leif Elinder, a pediatrician. The basis for the court's decision was the section of the Swedish constitution relating to freedom of the press. Since the university was a public body, it was obliged to turn over any documents to any citizen upon request unless the document was protected by a specific paragraph in the ♡❤Secrecy Law♡❤.

The university argued that the material should be protected by a paragraph referring to the confidentiality of information about patients. The courts decided, however, that they could hand over the data (about 70 shelf feet of documents) if they specified a proviso that would preserve confidentiality. The university was thus ordered to first write a proviso (set of conditions) for Kärfve and Elinder and then hand over the data. 

Gillberg and the other members of the research group refused to comply. They referred to the promise they had given to the participants in their studies that all the data would be kept completely confidential. They also argued that the data was particularly sensitive since the research concerned psychological and psychiatric disorders among children, and that it was impossible to anonymize the data beyond possible identification. When they had pursued all legal avenues without success, someone apparently destroyed the documents in May 2004.

The Gillberg group received considerable support from other medical researchers and from their university. They felt that important clinical research could be jeopardized unless complete confidentiality could be promised to the patients.

Eva Kärfve stated that she was happy with the prosecution and that it would "strengthen the protection of research in Sweden."

Marxist intellectuals released a letter supporting both the arrested &lt;a href="w%3AFARC"&gt;FARC&lt;/a&gt; leader Ricardo Gonzalez (also known as Rodrigo Granda) and the &lt;a href="Venezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;n President &lt;a href="Hugo%20Chavez"&gt;Hugo Chavez&lt;/a&gt;. Granda is the alleged adviser of the FARC.

&lt;a href="Colombia"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;n authorities arrested Granda on Dec. 13, 2004. The FARC is accused of &lt;a href="w%3Aterrorism"&gt;terrorism&lt;/a&gt; by the governments of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt; and Colombia. Their members are regularly searched by Colombian authorities. Worldwide, police agencies have an interest in FARC members because of their involvement in international &lt;a href="w%3Adrug%20trafficking"&gt;drug trafficking&lt;/a&gt;.

The arrest of Granda has caused disagreement. The FARC accuses Colombian authorities of capturing Granda inside Venezuelan territory. Venezuelan President Chavez claims Colombia invaded Venezuelan territory and possibly bribed Venezuelan officers. Colombia says the arrest occurred inside Colombian territory and that Granda was moved to Colombia by Venezuelans. Colombia admitted the payment of a reward for Granda, but rebutted accusations of bribery.

Recently, the Colombian government released an official notice accusing Venezuela of accepting representatives of terrorist organizations in political events sponsored by official Venezuelan institutions.

<h1>2005/01/19 Pacific Northwest soaked with &quot;Tropical Punch&quot;</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=2005/01/19%20Pacific%20Northwest%20soaked%20with%20%26quot%3BTropical%20Punch%26quot%3B&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

As much as 200 mm (8") of rain have been recorded in portions of &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Columbia"&gt;British Columbia&lt;/a&gt;, on the west coast of &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; since Monday. Even by "wet coast" standards, this is heavy rain.

The heavy and sustained precipitation across the lower mainland regions have caused mudslides and flooding, with roads and highways being closed and families evacuated. In Port Coquitlam, a retaining wall burst, throwing concrete and rubble tens of metres and covering an arterial road with mud to a depth of two metres.

Further inland and north, where colder temperatures have prevailed, the precipitation has been falling as freezing rain and sleet, or heavy snowfalls. Terrace, BC, was isolated as highways north and south of the city were closed due to a heavy glaze of ice. The &lt;a href="w%3ATrans-Canada%20Highway"&gt;Trans-Canada Highway&lt;/a&gt; and most other roads through the mountains were closed due to heavy and sudden snow accumulations which created severe avalanche hazards.

"The avalanche danger is at high or extreme in all of our six forecast areas," according to John Kelly at the Canadian Avalanche Centre in Revelstoke.

But these are only first hazards. "If the rain continues at the same magnitude and according to the forecast, then some of the rivers could reach flood stage either later [Tuesday] or Wednesday morning," said Allan Chapman, a hydrologist with the River Forecast Centre in Victoria.

The source of the wet weather is a large system reaching the coast from the &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Ocean"&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt; tropics, a type of system nicknamed by &lt;a href="w%3Ameteorology"&gt;meteorologists&lt;/a&gt; a "Tropical Punch". A similar system caused severe flooding and precipitation in 2003.

The system is not going away, either. &lt;a href="w%3AEnvironment%20Canada"&gt;Environment Canada&lt;/a&gt; expects the system, which lies southwest of &lt;a href="w%3AVancouver%20Island"&gt;Vancouver Island&lt;/a&gt;, to continue to develop "waves" of weather which will strike the mainland and head inland over the next several days to a week, possibly dropping 50-100 mm (2"-4") of additional rain per day at least until the end of the weekend.

<h1>Romanian economy booms in 2004</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Romanian%20economy%20booms%20in%202004&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARomania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;'s National Institute for Statistics has announced a record growth of 8.3% in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Agross%20domestic%20product"&gt;gross domestic product&lt;/a&gt; for the year of 2004, the highest growth since the fall of communism in 1989. This growth is surprising, seeing as most analysts predicted that GDP would grow by only 5-6% in 2004. Growth was driven mainly by domestic consumption, as well as by increased foreign investment and a good agricultural yield. The growth of 8.3% was also one of the highest in Europe, exceeding by far that of Romania's neighbours &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABulgaria"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AHungary"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3APoland"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;.

Despite the introduction of a new 16% flat tax for personal income and company profit, which will boost foreign investment, economic growth is expected to ease in 2005 to around 5.5%. However, on the back of projected economic reforms, growth is expected to break the 8% barrier again in 2006.

Romania, for a long time lagging behind its neighbours in terms of economic growth and per-capita GDP, has posted strong growth since 2001. However, while having one of the highest standards of living in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASoutheastern%20Europe"&gt;southeastern Europe&lt;/a&gt;, Romania continued to lag behind Central Europe in terms of per-capita GDP, which is now about half that of Romania's neighbour Hungary and around one-third of the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; average.

While some analysts predict that the current high rate of growth is due to a long time of GDP decline in the 1990s, others say that Romania is entering a cycle of boom which will continue for many years to come. Many of the new EU member states, as well as candidate countries such as Romania, have recorded solid growth in the last few years and are aspiring to emulate &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AIreland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, whose &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ACeltic%20Tiger"&gt;Celtic Tiger&lt;/a&gt; era of growth resulted in it transforming itself from one of the poorest countries in Western Europe to one of the wealthiest. The new 16% flat tax rate, as well as Romania's relatively low wages, are expected to boost foreign investment, which drove Ireland's economic boom and is also expected to play a major part in Romania's economic transformation.

The HVB Group mentioned in its recent report about the transition economies of Central and Eastern Europe that, by 2010, Romania will be a highly attractive destination for foreign investors and will continue growing economically at a solid rate. Romania's 2007 entry into the European Union is expected to further improve its reputation in the business world. However, although having a liberal fiscal policy, Romania must work in cutting red tape and discouraging &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Acorruption"&gt;corruption&lt;/a&gt;, which remain obstacles to further growth.

<h2>Inflation</h2>

Romania's &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AInflation"&gt;inflationary&lt;/a&gt; statistics also suggested a positive trend, with prices growing by 9.8% between year-end 2003 and year-end 2004. While this is still one of the highest rates of inflation in the region, it compared favourably to the 22.5% inflation recorded in 2002 and the 14.5% recorded in 2003. 

The &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ACalin%20Popescu%20Tariceanu"&gt;Tăriceanu&lt;/a&gt; government's inflationary target in 2005 is 7%, even though many international analysts, including the HVB Group, suspect this will be hard to reach due to the predicted widening of the budget deficit in 2005. The budget deficit is expected to increase because of the new tax system, which will lead to lower revenues for the government. Romania has long been criticised for its high rate of inflation and has been pressured by the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AInternational%20Monetary%20Fund"&gt;International Monetary Fund&lt;/a&gt; to reduce its budget deficit.

&lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABucharest"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of &lt;a href="Romania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;, will become the first &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASoutheastern%20Europe"&gt;southeastern European&lt;/a&gt; city to host &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ACowParade"&gt;CowParade&lt;/a&gt;. 
Between June 1 and the end of August this year, the city will be flooded by herds of decorated cow sculptures, exhibited at well-known landmarks, such as &lt;a href="%3Aw%3APalace%20of%20the%20Parliament"&gt;The Palace of the Parliament&lt;/a&gt;, Europe's largest building, as well as on the streets and outside &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABucharest%20Metro"&gt;metro&lt;/a&gt; stations. Over 3000 local and international artists will participate in the event, decorating more than 100 life-sized &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Afiberglass"&gt;fibreglass&lt;/a&gt; cows. The decorated cows will feature Romanian and Bucharestean themes, as well as issues related to international city life.

After the event ends, all the cows will be auctioned off, with the proceeds donated to the &lt;a href="w%3ASpecial%20Olympics"&gt;Special Olympics&lt;/a&gt; Romania, a charity helping athletes with mental disabilities. The Bucharest CowParade is organised by Event Horizon, a Romanian marketing consultancy.

CowParade, which was first held in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AZurich"&gt;Zurich&lt;/a&gt; in 1998, has been held in 22 cities in 5 continents and is today the world's largest public art event.

Bucharest was chosen from over 500 other candidate cities and has waited for the event for a couple of years. The new local government in Bucharest wants to relaunch the city's image as a creative and colourful metropolis and have therefore enthusiastically supported the exhibition. The high-profile event is expected to boost the image of Bucharest worldwide, especially in the artistic scene.

Mr Odair de Inácio Góis, aged 52, died Tuesday night at 8:30 at the Central Hospital of &lt;a href="w%3AS%C3%A3o%20Bernardo%20do%20Campo"&gt;São Bernardo do Campo&lt;/a&gt;, in the state of &lt;a href="w%3AS%C3%A3o%20Paulo"&gt;São Paulo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Brazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;. 

According to the doctors, he had a heart attack. Inácio was the paternal half-brother of the Brazilian President &lt;a href="w%3ALuiz%20In%C3%A1cio%20Lula%20da%20Silva"&gt;Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva&lt;/a&gt;. The funeral will be held at Paulicéia Cemitery in São Bernado do Campo. President Lula had between 17 and 25 siblings (including half-brothers and half-sisters).

A video provided by the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.aei.org/default.asp%3Ffilter%3Dall"&gt;American Enterprise Institute&lt;/a&gt; intends to show tortures committed by the soldiers of &lt;a href="w%3ASaddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt; during his rule.

The film shows extremely graphic scenes and it is ♡❤♡NOT SUITABLE FOR CHILDREN♡❤♡. It depicts Iraqi soldiers singing and praising Saddam, beating prisoners and cutting prisoners' fingers and hands off.

During Saddam Hussein's regime, about a quarter of a million Iraqis were &lt;a href="http%3A//hrw.org/campaigns/iraq/graves/slideshow_as2/slideshow_as2.html"&gt;executed&lt;/a&gt;. Many individual Iraqis of all faiths and ethnicities were tortured and killed for real or perceived opposition to Iraq's government. Torture during Saddam's regime was characterized by: medical experiments, &lt;a href="w%3Acrucifixion"&gt;crucifixions&lt;/a&gt;, genital amputations, hot iron marking, tongue fixing with a nail, teeth extraction with pincers, public beheadings, etc.

The four minute video (27.4 &lt;a href="w%3AMebibyte"&gt;MiB&lt;/a&gt;) can be &lt;a href="http%3A//www.aei.org/events/eventID.844%2Cfilter.all/event_detail.asp"&gt;downloaded&lt;/a&gt; from the AEI website. 

This video was released in June 2004. Most of the American and international media didn't show it until now, despite the fact that channels of mass communication regularly released Abu Ghraib's torture photos.

Over two million &lt;a href="w%3AMuslim"&gt;Muslims&lt;/a&gt; have today gathered in the &lt;a href="Saudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi&lt;/a&gt; capital of Meccah for the annual pilgrimage, or &lt;a href="w%3AHajj"&gt;♡❤hajj♡❤&lt;/a&gt;. The climbing of the 18 km west of mecca Mount Arafat is the high point of the visit.

The Saudi government, however, is taking no chances and has arranged for over 50,000 &lt;a href="w%3ASecurity"&gt;security&lt;/a&gt; officials to deter would-be terrorists and to prevent stampedes. 

More than 20,000 buses will be carrying pilgrims to where the prophet &lt;a href="w%3AMuhammad"&gt;Muhammad&lt;/a&gt; supposedly gave his last sermon. The pilgrims gather in the Namera mosque, where they stand for a whole day, dressed in their white garments, to repent their sins.

All able-bodied Muslims are expected to complete the ceremony at least once in their lives.

&lt;a href="w%3AWashington"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20Legislature"&gt;state legislator&lt;/a&gt; Tracy Eide (&lt;a href="w%3ADemoctaric%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;D&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Way"&gt;Federal Way&lt;/a&gt;) wants to pass a bill making it illegal to drive a motor vehicle and have a &lt;a href="w%3AMobile%20phone"&gt;cell phone&lt;/a&gt; in your hand. There are exceptions, such as reporting an accident or in an emergency, but under her bill drivers would be required to use a "hands-free" device with their cell phone or face a penalty of $100.

Several studies have found a link between cell phone use and accidents. A &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20England%20Journal%20of%20Medicine"&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; reported study found that driving while using a cell phone creates distractions similar to driving with a blood alcohol reading of 0.08%. According to the Washington State Department of Transportation, approximately 700 accidents involving drivers using cell phones occurred in 2004.

"Where's your other hand? There's got to be two hands on the wheel. Signaling, people aren't signaling any more. You start thinking about the big picture, it gets kind of scary out there and people, it's the equivalent of driving while you're intoxicated," said Tracy Eide. 

Cell phone companies are opposed to the bill, saying people can still use the radio and put make-up on while driving. "Certainly when my kids were little, haven't we all been guilty of turning around and going 'hey, knock it off.' Well, you're taking your eyes off the road," said a governmental affairs representative for Sprint.

&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Jersey"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="w%3ADistrict%20of%20Columbia"&gt;District of Columbia&lt;/a&gt; already ban holding a cell phone while driving; a "hands-free" cell phone is legal. Other states, such as Maryland, are considering other bans such as targeting youthful drivers on provisional licenses.

Researchers in Britain have claimed that genetically modified crops can benefit wildlife.

The scientists at Broom's Barn research station discovered that with modified crop management systems genetically modified herbicide-tolerant sugar beet could help wildlife. They timed the spring application of herbicide to maximise both crop yields and the benefits of leaving weeds in the field. Insects could feed on the weeds, and birds could feed on the insects, as well as the seeds from the weeds. The second summer spray of herbicide was eliminated, reducing costs and the amount of chemicals used.

It is hoped that these cost benefits and the high crop yields will lead to farmer's acceptance of these approaches if the beet is authorised for widespread planting.

The study, Management Of GM Herbicide-tolerant Sugar Beet For Spring And Autumn Environmental Benefit, was funded in 2001 and 2002 by a consortium of GM industry interests, the Association of Biotechnology Companies (ABC).

WASHINGTON D.C., United States – The United States inaugurated &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; for a second term as president today. In his speech to the American people, Bush highlighted the need to bring freedom to world, using the word "freedom" some 19 times and "tyranny" 5 times. 

"America will not pretend that jailed dissidents prefer their chains, or that women welcome humiliation and servitude, or that any human being aspires to live at the mercy of bullies," said Bush.

Security has been very tight in the nation's capital, despite the lack of any specific threats. The costs of security have fallen to the District of Columbia, a departure from past inaugurations. The money will come out of the District's Homeland Security Fund.

A three-day celebration costing around US$40-50 million has been organized for the President. It is set to be the most expensive inauguration celebration in U.S. history.

The inaugration week is the only time that companies can wine and dine politicians. For instance, the Secretary of Transportation, Norm Mineta, was entertained by &lt;a href="w%3AGeneral%20Motors"&gt;General Motors&lt;/a&gt;, a company over which he has considerable regulatory power.

Three British soldiers are being court martialled by a military court in Osnabruck, Germany. They are accused of abusing Iraqi prisoners at a humanitarian aid camp called the Bread Basket outside of Basra, in May 2003.

The court has been shown 22 photographs showing the alleged abuse. British Prime Minister Tony Blair has expressed his disgust at the images but also his hopes that the allegations will not taint the image of the British Army.

Two soldiers are denying all charges while a third has admitted one charge, but denied another. One soldier's defence lawyer has stated that the soldiers were following orders, having been told to "work [the prisoners] hard."

The trial is expected to last three to four weeks.
