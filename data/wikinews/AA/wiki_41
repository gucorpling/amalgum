A celebrity sex tape starring former ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Idol"&gt;American Idol&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ finalist &lt;a href="w%3AJessica%20Sierra"&gt;Jessica Sierra&lt;/a&gt; has been leaked to an internet pornography company, who is reportedly planning to release it.

Sierra made her fame as a finalist on the 2005 season of ♡❤American Idol♡❤, in which she was the third finalist eliminated. The new tape is reported to show her in a number of nude poses in a hotel room. The footage will be released later this month.

Sierra is already suffering from negative press as she appeared in court on Sunday. She had been arrested after being kicked out the Full Moon Saloon in &lt;a href="w%3AYbor%20City"&gt;Ybor City&lt;/a&gt; early the previous morning, after which she is said to have attacked first a friend, then passing onlookers. Local officials claim that after being arrested, she offered to perform &lt;a href="w%3Aoral%20sex"&gt;oral sex&lt;/a&gt; with the police officers who arrested her if they would release her.

The site TMZ.com say they have received several stills from the video, and have posted one on their website. They also say the tape's release will coincide with the start of the next series of ♡❤American Idol♡❤.

&lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Florida"&gt;University of Florida&lt;/a&gt; quarterback &lt;a href="w%3ATim%20Tebow"&gt;Tim Tebow&lt;/a&gt; became the first underclassman in &lt;a href="w%3ANCAA"&gt;NCAA&lt;/a&gt; history to obtain the coveted &lt;a href="w%3AHeisman%20Trophy"&gt;Heisman Trophy&lt;/a&gt; Saturday night. The award was presented to him at a ceremony in &lt;a href="New%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;. He received 1,957 points and 462 first-place votes.

Second in the voting was &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Arkansas"&gt;University of Arkansas&lt;/a&gt; running back &lt;a href="w%3ADarren%20McFadden"&gt;Darren McFadden&lt;/a&gt;, who was also the runner-up in the Heisman voting last year. He received 1,703 points and 291 first-place votes. &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Hawaii"&gt;University of Hawaii&lt;/a&gt; quarterback &lt;a href="w%3AColt%20Brennan"&gt;Colt Brennan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Missouri"&gt;University of Missouri&lt;/a&gt; quarterback &lt;a href="w%3AChase%20Daniel"&gt;Chase Daniel&lt;/a&gt; came in third and fourth, respectively.

Tebow is the third Florida player to win the Heisman. In 2007, he became the first player in &lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20I-A"&gt;Division I-A&lt;/a&gt; history to score 20 rushing touchdowns and 20 passing touchdowns in one season. He finished the season with 3,132 passing yards and 29 touchdowns along with 838 rushing yards and 22 touchdowns. Last season, he helped the Florida Gators win the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20BCS%20National%20Championship%20Game"&gt;2007 BCS National Championship Game&lt;/a&gt;. The Gators will play against the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Michigan"&gt;Michigan Wolverines&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3ACapital%20One%20Bowl"&gt;Capital One Bowl&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Orlando"&gt;Orlando&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; on New Year's Day.

&lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; have today announced that the launch of &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Atlantis"&gt;Space Shuttle Atlantis&lt;/a&gt;, mission &lt;a href="w%3ASTS-122"&gt;STS-122&lt;/a&gt;, which is a module delivery mission to the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Space%20Station"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt; (ISS), will be delayed until January 2nd, 2008 at the earliest, after scrubbing today's launch attempt, and an earlier attempt on December 6th.

The decision to scrub the launch attempt was made at 7:24 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3AEST"&gt;EST&lt;/a&gt; by shuttle program managers. The reason behind the scrubbing is to allow shuttle engineers to spend time diagnosing and fixing the erroneous readings presented to the crew and Mission Control by the intermittent malfunctioning of a critical engine cutoff sensor (ECO). While only one of the four sensors was malfunctioning, the current launch criteria for the mission state that all four ECOs must be functioning correctly in order to launch.

At a meeting held at 9 a.m., NASAs Mission Management Team for STS-122 decided on a postponement until January 2nd at the very earliest. Atlantis is due to deliver the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Space%20Agency"&gt;European Space Agency&lt;/a&gt;'s (ESA) &lt;a href="w%3AColumbus%20laboratory"&gt;Columbus laboratory&lt;/a&gt; module to the ISS. Alan Thirkettle, ESA's Space Station Program Manager, said, regarding the delay in launch: "In the big picture, it's not a setback. [But] it is disappointing because we have 750 people over here."

Arsenal failed to move four points clear at the top of the Premier League table after they suffered their first league defeat of the season at the hands of Middlesbrough. The Gunners got off to the worst possible start after Middlesbrough were awarded a penalty by referee Howard Webb in the fourth minute. Stewart Downing converted it to give Boro the lead. 

Turkish forward Tuncay Sanli sealed the victory for Middlesbrough 16 minutes from time when he shot high into the net. Tomas Rosicky scored a consolation goal for the visitors in the fifth minute of stoppage time but it was Boro's day. The three points meant that they moved out of the relegation zone and into 16th place. At the top Arsenal are now just one point clear of second placed Manchester United after dropping five points in their last two matches.

Leaders of &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; have ended their summit in &lt;a href="Portugal"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt; by declaring a new era in relations aimed at confronting new global challenges. But they could not avoid sparring over some older issues involving &lt;a href="w%3Ahuman%20rights"&gt;human rights&lt;/a&gt; and conflict on the continent. 

The president of the European Union, Portugal's Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJose%20Socrates"&gt;Jose Socrates&lt;/a&gt;, closed the summit today, saying African and European leaders have turned a new page in history. He says the leaders have adopted an agenda to confront serious challenges of security, governance, migration and climate change.

Nevertheless, long-standing disagreements re-emerged during the two-day meeting.

&lt;a href="Germany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; Chancellor &lt;a href="w%3AAngela%20Merkel"&gt;Angela Merkel&lt;/a&gt;, in her speech on governance and human rights, accused &lt;a href="Zimbabwe"&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt;'s President &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Mugabe"&gt;Robert Mugabe&lt;/a&gt; of harming Africa's image by quashing political freedom and human rights in his country.

Mr. Mugabe was invited to the summit despite being banned from Europe five years ago because of rigged elections in his country. His attendance prompted a boycott by the prime minister of &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Gordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt;, the former colonial power in Zimbabwe.

The head of the African Union, &lt;a href="Ghana"&gt;Ghana&lt;/a&gt;'s President &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Kufuor"&gt;John Kufuor&lt;/a&gt;, responded to Ms. Merkel's remarks by noting that &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;n President &lt;a href="w%3AThabo%20Mbeki"&gt;Thabo Mbeki&lt;/a&gt; is mediating talks between Zimbabwe's ruling party and the opposition in an effort to bring free and fair elections next year.

"It is not for anybody to just move in there and impose a solution," he said. "We want to encourage a home-grown solution so there will be a restoration of normalcy and good governance for the people of Zimbabwe."

Several European leaders met with &lt;a href="Sudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt;'s President &lt;a href="w%3AOmar%20al-Bashir"&gt;Omar al-Bashir&lt;/a&gt; and strongly urged him to allow the deployment of &lt;a href="w%3AU.N."&gt;U.N.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AA.U."&gt;A.U.&lt;/a&gt; troops to end bloodshed and suffering in its &lt;a href="w%3ADarfur"&gt;Darfur&lt;/a&gt; region. Sudan has accepted this hybrid force, but has rejected troops from non-African countries.

Mr. Kufuor said Africa has taken the initiative on the issue, though he acknowledged it has taken some time to assemble the hybrid force.

"I believe with good will all around the hybrid force will be put together so at least humanitarian actions can be brought to the people of Darfur," added Mr. Kufuor.

African leaders also objected to the E.U. efforts to forge temporary trade agreements with developing nations, which they say will unleash excessive competition on their emerging economies. The European Union says these are needed because existing accords are due to expire at the end of this month.

E.U. Commission President &lt;a href="w%3AJose%20Manuel%20Barroso"&gt;Jose Manuel Barroso&lt;/a&gt; noted that these are temporary agreements that are meant to maintain &lt;a href="w%3Atariff"&gt;tariff&lt;/a&gt; exemptions for African &lt;a href="w%3Aexports"&gt;exports&lt;/a&gt; to the European Union.

"Once we have settled this transitional phase, we [will] have the time and the spirit to address development issues and important concerns that were raised also from the African Union side," said Barroso.

He said he believes that all but a few African governments will sign the interim accords by the end of the year.

The leaders agreed to hold their next summit in a couple of years on African soil.

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="United%20States%20Congress"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt; has launched its own inquiry into a decision by the U.S spy agency to destroy tapes of interrogations of terror suspects, with &lt;a href="CIA"&gt;Central Intelligence Agency&lt;/a&gt; chief &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Hayden"&gt;Michael Hayden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; testifying before lawmakers this week.

The Chairman of the &lt;a href="US%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASenate%20Intelligence%20Committee"&gt;Intelligence Committee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Democrat &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJay%20Rockefeller"&gt;Jay Rockefeller&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;a href="West%20Virginia"&gt;West Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, says Hayden will appear before his panel.

"CIA director Michael Hayden is going appear before our committee on this coming Tuesday and talk about interrogation and techniques," said Rockefeller. 

During an appearance on the CBS television program ♡❤Face the Nation♡❤, Rockefeller made clear members have a lot of questions about the destroyed videotapes.

"Were there things on those tapes that they did not want to have seen, that did not conform to what the attorney general would allow them to do?" he said.

Rockefeller indicated the session will take place behind closed doors, to enable law makers to delve into areas that are still considered top secret, and have to do with specific interrogation procedures.

The CIA director disclosed the destroyed videotapes last Thursday, after he got word that their existence had been uncovered by the news media. The tapes which were made in 2002, showed the interrogation of top terror suspects. They were destroyed in 2005, and Congressional critics charge that could amount to tampering with legal evidence and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aobstruction%20of%20justice"&gt;obstruction of justice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Democrat &lt;a href="Joe%20Biden"&gt;Joe Biden&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Delaware"&gt;Delaware&lt;/a&gt;, chairman of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASenate%20Foreign%20Relations%20Committee"&gt;Senate Foreign Relations Committee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and former chair of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJudiciary%20panel"&gt;Judiciary panel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , says the preliminary joint inquiry by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJustice%20Department"&gt;Justice Department&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the CIA announced yesterday is not enough.

Biden, who is running for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination, was interviewed on ABC's ♡❤This Week♡❤.

"I think that Hayden is not to be the judge of whether or not his condoning the destroying of the tapes was lawful. It appears as though there may be an obstruction of justice charge here, tampering with evidence, destroying evidence,and I think this is one case where it really does call for a special counsel," said Biden.

Hayden told CIA employees Thursday the tapes were destroyed out of fears that if they ever became public, the identities of the interrogators would be revealed and their lives would be in danger.

President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush&lt;/a&gt; gave the intelligence community the go-ahead to use enhanced interrogation techniques on terror suspects following the &lt;a href="9/11"&gt;September 11th 2001&lt;/a&gt;, attacks on the United States.

The Bush administration has refused to specify which methods are permitted, but critics charge some amount to torture, including a procedure known as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Awaterboarding"&gt;waterboarding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which simulates drowning.

Republican Senator &lt;a href="John%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Arizona"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt; has called for the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to publicly disavow the use of harsh interrogation techniques.

He appeared on the Fox News ♡❤Sunday♡❤ television program.

"What this does in a larger sense is it harms the credibility and the moral standing of America in the world again," said McCain. "There will be skepticism and cynicism all over the world about how we treat prisoners and whether we practice torture or not."

Senator McCain, a former &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVietnam%20War"&gt;Vietnam War&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; era &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aprisoner%20of%20war"&gt;prisoner of war&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , has been one of the most outspoken members of Congress on the treatment of detainees in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Awar%20on%20terror"&gt;war on terror&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . He is campaigning to become the Republican Party's presidential nominee.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=British%20Prime%20Minister%20calls%20for%20the%20immediate%20release%20of%205%20Britons%20kidnapped%20in%20Iraq&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="Gordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt; has called for the immediate release of 5 British hostages abducted in &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; last May. 

For the first time since the 5 Britons were abducted on May 29 from a Finance Ministry compound by gunmen posing as police officers, a video released Tuesday by a group called the &lt;a href="w%3AIslamic%20Shia%20Resistance"&gt;Islamic Shia Resistance&lt;/a&gt; in Iraq showed one of the men being held. It was the first public evidence that the men might still be alive.

"My name is Jason and today is the 18th of November," said one of the hostages.

In that video, the captors say they will start to kill the hostages, who include four security guards and one computer expert, if Britain does not withdraw all of its remaining troops from Iraq soon.

Over the months, little if anything has been disclosed about what Britain is doing to gain the release of those held. Today, Brown underlined that behind the scenes, things were being done.

"The taking of hostages is completely unjustified, wholly unacceptable and we are making it clear they will not change our policy in any way," Brown said. "We will do everything in our power to secure our objective, which is the immediate release of the hostages." He however stressed that Britain will not be making any kind of deal to gain the release of the five.

Speaking on Sky News, British Foreign Secretary &lt;a href="David%20Miliband"&gt;David Miliband&lt;/a&gt; spoke of the stress the families of those being held are under.

"It is important that publicity is never confused with activity, and especially in a case like this, it is very, very important that we follow a very careful strategy," said Miliband. "The stress of the families is going to be huge. It is bad enough to have the hostage-taking. To then have the video coming out last week is just going to add, has added, hugely to the distress. But the whole of the British government is working very, very actively on this."

The family and friends of the hostages also appealed for the release, in an emotional appeal which took place on Wednesday.
Brown also praised Iraqi Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ANouri%20al-Maliki"&gt;Maliki&lt;/a&gt; and his government for their efforts to free the men.

The father, who along with his deceased son has only been identified by his last name of ♡❤Lu♡❤, is said to be recovering from the virus at a hospital.

Neither of the men have had contact with dead or infected poultry, and there are no reports of any other Bird Flu infections at this time. It is still not fully known how the two contracted the virus, and officials are not ruling out human to human transmission.

The son was from the &lt;a href="w%3AJiangsu"&gt;Jiangsu Province&lt;/a&gt; of eastern China and was admitted to the hospital after having severe flu-like symptoms. Lu was originally diagnosed with &lt;a href="w%3Apneumonia"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;. Tests done on blood samples from Lu later confirmed the presence of the H5N1 virus.

At least 68 other individuals are being kept under close observation, after having come in close contact with both men, but officials say that so far, none of those other individuals are showing any signs of infection.

As of December 9, the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organization"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; reported that the total number of deaths from the H5N1 in China is 17.

Worldwide, 207 people have died from the virus since 2003.

The police, fire service and bomb disposal unit were called in with a device that can detect anthrax, and it was later determined that the substance found was not anthrax, but was in fact a fertilizer and the letters, an apparent hoax. 

The substance will be shipped to the capital and will be screened by Environmental Sciences and Research to determine what exactly the substance is. Emergency services blocked of roads and the people who were exposed to the suspect letters were decontaminated. 

No injuries are reported and no one has yet experienced any symptoms of exposure.

This past Saturday at &lt;a href="2007%20Taipei%20IT%20Month"&gt;2007 Taipei IT Month&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIntel"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; invited hardware engineers, overclocking experts, and gamers to participate in the "Intel Taiwan Overclocking Live Test" at the &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20World%20Trade%20Center"&gt;Taipei World Trade Center&lt;/a&gt; to share techniques and technology for &lt;a href="w%3Aoverclocking"&gt;overclocking&lt;/a&gt; and other hardware tweaking.

According to Intel Taiwan, this "Live Test" event was a friendly competition for participating engineers. It was similar to the "Live Test Center" previously held by &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n computing magazine ♡❤PC Professionel♡❤. At this overclocking festival, Intel provided high-standard hardware on which the participants challenged the extremes of overclocking as measured by benchmark records on &lt;a href="w%3APCMark"&gt;PCMark05&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3A3DMark"&gt;3DMark 2006&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ASuper%20PI"&gt;Super PI 1M&lt;/a&gt;.

Throughout these tests, the organizers frequently reminded spectators not to get too close to the hardware due to the dangers of overclocking and tweaking hardware. Finally, a new Taiwan Record of 15335 points on PCMark05 was established by Wei-che Chang.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Wikinews%20interviews%20Peter%20%26quot%3BShamino%26quot%3B%20Tan%20from%20Singapore%20about%20overclocking&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Last Saturday, the "Intel Taiwan Overclocking Live Test" took place in the &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20World%20Trade%20Center"&gt;Taipei World Trade Center&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei"&gt;Taipei&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;, which drew many spectators to come and see the hardware experts at work. &lt;a href="w%3AOverclocking"&gt;Overclocking&lt;/a&gt; (running computer hardware at a higher clock rate than normally) is more of an enjoyment for senior gamers or engineers, while the average computer users may lack the basic concepts of it, causing hardware to halt when they attempt it.

With those issues in mind, Wikinews freelance reporter interviewed Peter "Shamino" Tan, an overclocking expert from &lt;a href="Singapore"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt;, to clear up some of the basic issues relating to overclocking.

<h2>Interview</h2>

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rico Shen&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; It was nice to witness this overclocking festival, and this is my second time after I saw an overclocking test at 2007 &lt;a href="w%3ACOMPUTEX%20Taipei"&gt;COMPUTEX Taipei&lt;/a&gt;. What portion of the computing population most often try to overclock their computers?

♡❤♡Shamino♡❤♡: Generally, gamers often try overclocking because several games perform best when graphics display and computing are at optimal conditions. They needs high-level hardware to fulfill the requirements of those games. But some senior engineers also try overclocking tests to examine performance on newly-developed hardware before marketing it. Roughly speaking, any user who understands hardware functioning may experiment with overclocking.

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;RS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; I remember that in a conference, an expert recommended engineers to be cautious for safety reasons, why is that?

♡❤♡Shamino♡❤♡: If someone wants to try overclocking, all hardware should be waterproof and safety is a paramount issue that experts should be concerned about. If they know the risks and can afford the results of overclocking, then the public can rely on those experts when they do overclocking.

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;RS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Which software is recommended when overclocking hardware?

♡❤♡Shamino♡❤♡: &lt;a href="w%3A3D%20Mark"&gt;3D Mark&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACPU-Z"&gt;CPU-Z&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APCMark"&gt;PCMark05&lt;/a&gt;, SysTool, CPUCool, and CPUIdle are often used for overclocking, but it depends on the individual users to make their own decisions. Generally, most experts recommend 3D Mark and PCMark05.

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;RS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; What about overclocking for the general public?

♡❤♡Shamino♡❤♡: Overclocking has some risks as I mentioned before. It's often attempted by general users or the public who have just witnessed someone doing overclocking. But, in fact, if someone does proper research over the Internet before doing overclocking, then an relatively safe overclocking test can be tried.

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;RS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Just some facts about &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan%20External%20Trade%20Development%20Council"&gt;TAITRA&lt;/a&gt;: a Live Test Center was established at COMPUTEX Taipei in 2005 and 2006, but it was canceled this year. Although some hardware companies won some awards there, what have been the effects of the Live Test Center on the hardware industry?

♡❤♡Shamino♡❤♡: I remember that a foreign magazine set up this pavilion for companies to examine performances in it. If they are seeking to raise the profile of this pavilion by winning awards, I don't think it's practical.

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;RS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Many thanks, I think lots of concepts should be modified according to your advice.

<h1>Entertainers and sportspeople make their stops at 2007 Taipei IT Month</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Entertainers%20and%20sportspeople%20make%20their%20stops%20at%202007%20Taipei%20IT%20Month&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Recently on two weekends of &lt;a href="2007%20Taipei%20IT%20Month"&gt;2007 Taipei IT Month&lt;/a&gt;, some entertainers from &lt;a href="Hong%20Kong"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; and basketball players from &lt;a href="w%3ASuper%20Basketball%20League"&gt;Super Basketball League&lt;/a&gt; chose their promotional stage at 2007 Taipei IT Month to promote their and exhibitors' notabilities. Apparently, it caused their fans and crowded public visiting IT Month on two weekends.

Last week from December 1 &amp; 2, members from MACHI brothers Stanley Huang and Jeff Huang, and a singer from &lt;a href="Hong%20Kong"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AKaren%20Mok"&gt;Karen Mok&lt;/a&gt; visited this show to help exhibitors promote their new products and activities. On the other hand, a Taiwanese band "DA Mouth" and a famous Taiwanese singer Waa Wei successively held small concerts in the showground, this is differ than before because lots of medium-small concerts often held in the PAMC K-Mall or &lt;a href="w%3AXimending"&gt;Ximending&lt;/a&gt;.

At recent 2 days (December 8 &amp; 9), 5 players from &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan%20Beer%20%28basketball%29"&gt;Taiwan Beer Basketball Team&lt;/a&gt; like Chih-chieh Lin, Xing-liang Lou, Xiao-yuan Ha, Shih-nien Chen, and Shou-cheng He helped Asia Pacific Telecom Inc. for the cellular phone charity bidding. Not only this, entertainers like &lt;a href="w%3ARainie%20Yang"&gt;Rainie Yang&lt;/a&gt;, Sonia Sui, and a Taiwanese women musical group &lt;a href="w%3AHei%20Se%20Hui%20Mei%20Mei"&gt;Hei Se Hui Mei Mei&lt;/a&gt; all successively visited booths of Ergotech Corp., Mio Technology, and Chinese Gamer International Corp. in this show.

In fact, this phenomenon, a company invited notable people to visit a show, often appeared at some consuming shows in the &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20World%20Trade%20Center"&gt;Taipei World Trade Center&lt;/a&gt; especially on gaming or IT shows. It often brought profits for entertainers, sportspeople, media, consumer, and companies as they separately gained what they need each other.

The &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;an Union summit ended yesterday in &lt;a href="Portugal"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt; with agreement on many global challenges but with differences on other key issues.

European and &lt;a href="w%3AAfrican%20Union"&gt;African Union&lt;/a&gt; leaders left the Portuguese capital expressing satisfaction for the most part with their first summit in seven years and what they called a new spirit in relations between the two continents.

The head of the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Commission"&gt;European Commission&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9%20Manuel%20Barroso"&gt;José Manuel Barroso&lt;/a&gt;, said they agreed that climate change probably represents the most important challenge of the 21st Century.

"&lt;a href="w%3AClimate%20change"&gt;Climate change&lt;/a&gt; is not just an issue for environment," he said. "It's also an issue for development. And only with the commitment of African leaders and European leaders can we really achieve some progress."

The leaders agreed to increase efforts to fight &lt;a href="w%3Adeforestation"&gt;deforestation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Adesertification"&gt;desertification&lt;/a&gt;.

The president of the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;, Portuguese Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9%20S%C3%B3crates"&gt;José Sócrates&lt;/a&gt;, said the summit's plan to deal with migration was an example of the new partnership. He says the leaders want to combat illegal immigration but encourage legal migration and help immigrants to integrate more fully into their new countries.

The leaders agreed to develop information programs for would-be migrants in Africa and to address the drain of African skilled workers by promoting ethical recruitment policies in critical fields.

On governance, the head of the African Union, &lt;a href="Ghana"&gt;Ghana&lt;/a&gt;'s President &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Kufuor"&gt;John Kufuor&lt;/a&gt;, said Africa has an interest in good governance and respect for human rights.

"Transparency is the order of the day," he said. "This is not to saying there is perfection. The point is that we all see that it is with good governance that we will attract the partnerships for development that we need."

He noted that the AU has created mechanisms such as the &lt;a href="w%3AAfrican%20Peer%20Review%20Mechanism"&gt;Africa Peer Review&lt;/a&gt; to promote these ideals.

The leaders also agreed to promote security by developing a system for rapid conflict prevention and funds for an African rapid deployment force, but &lt;a href="w%3Ahuman%20rights"&gt;human rights&lt;/a&gt; issues brought discord.
&lt;a href="Germany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; Chancellor &lt;a href="w%3AAngela%20Merkel"&gt;Angela Merkel&lt;/a&gt; criticized &lt;a href="Zimbabwe"&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt;'s President &lt;a href="Robert%20Mugabe"&gt;Robert Mugabe&lt;/a&gt;'s human rights record as bringing shame on the continent. This led Mr. Mugabe to accuse her of arrogance. A dispute over whether to invite Mr. Mugabe blocked the summit for five years and was only resolved a few months ago.

&lt;a href="Sudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt;ese President &lt;a href="w%3AOmar%20al-Bashir"&gt;Omar al-Bashir&lt;/a&gt; met with &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; officials seeking to deploy a joint U.N.-Africa peacekeeping force in &lt;a href="w%3ADarfur"&gt;Darfur&lt;/a&gt;. The two sides said some clarifications were obtained but that critical needs remain, in particular air support.

The issue of &lt;a href="w%3Afree%20trade"&gt;free trade&lt;/a&gt; agreements caused the most public controversy. &lt;a href="Senegal"&gt;Senegal&lt;/a&gt;'s President &lt;a href="w%3AAbdoulaye%20Wade"&gt;Abdoulaye Wade&lt;/a&gt; said the accords would set back African development.

He says there is no African industry that can withstand competition from Europe with its millions of consumers.

Most African governments have refused to sign the accords. The accords exempt African exports from European tariffs but also call for lower African tariffs on European goods. European officials said negotiations will continue.

Civic organizations had little praise for the summit. The &lt;a href="w%3AOxfam"&gt;Oxfam&lt;/a&gt; group said African opposition to the trade agreements should serve as a wake-up call to European leaders.

&lt;a href="w%3AHuman%20Rights%20Watch"&gt;Human Rights Watch&lt;/a&gt; said the summit failed to make any progress on restoring the rule of law in &lt;a href="Zimbabwe"&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt;, bringing peace to &lt;a href="w%3ADarfur"&gt;Darfur&lt;/a&gt; or preventing banks from protecting the wealth of corrupt officials.

And &lt;a href="w%3ASave%20The%20Children"&gt;Save The Children&lt;/a&gt; called the meeting a high profile exercise of little substance, noting that five million African children continue to die of preventable causes every year. It said since the leaders declared this a summit of equals they must bear equal responsibility for its failures.

Former ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Idol"&gt;American Idol&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ finalist &lt;a href="w%3AJessica%20Sierra"&gt;Jessica Sierra&lt;/a&gt;, 22, has had her invitation to perform at an upcoming concert for &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; troops retracted, following her recent arrest for disorderly conduct while intoxicated.

Sierra is likely to remain in jail at the Hillsborough County jail in her native &lt;a href="w%3ATampa"&gt;Tampa&lt;/a&gt; until her next hearing on December 20, where she is being held without bail, which would prevent her attending the &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; event on Friday even if she still had permission to perform.

Sierra has been in jail since the start of the month after an altercation with police officers outside a Tampa nightclub, which she had been ejected from. She is charged with disorderly intoxication and resisting arrest.

"While we appreciate Ms. Sierra's past efforts to support US troops, including performing for them in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; on Independence Day, it is quite obvious that Ms. Sierra needs to devote a great deal of time to putting her life back together. That effort must take place in private and not in the limelight of the public eye or on the stage." said a statement by retired Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Buzz Patterson concerning the event.

Patterson said &lt;a href="w%3AMove%20America%20Forward"&gt;Move America Forward&lt;/a&gt;, who is organizing the concert, had received comments from patrons who were concerned about her participation. John Fitzgibbons, attorney for Jessica, refused to comment.

&lt;a href="w%3AGlobal%20warming"&gt;Global warming&lt;/a&gt; campaigner and former U.S. Vice President &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Gore"&gt;Al Gore&lt;/a&gt; says it is time for humanity to stop "waging war" on planet Earth.

Gore spoke today in &lt;a href="w%3AOslo"&gt;Oslo&lt;/a&gt; after receiving the &lt;a href="Nobel%20Peace%20Prize"&gt;Nobel Peace Prize&lt;/a&gt;. He urged the two largest carbon-emitting countries - the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; - to make what he called the "boldest moves" to fight global warming.

The United States has not ratified the &lt;a href="w%3AKyoto%20Protocol"&gt;Kyoto Protocol&lt;/a&gt;, the 1997 international pact that requires reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. China was not required to reduce emissions under the deal. They also refused today to approve a new treaty designed to cut emissions by 25 percent to 40 percent by 2020.

Gore said he would go to the &lt;a href="w%3AU.N."&gt;U.N.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20United%20Nations%20Climate%20Change%20Conference"&gt;climate meeting&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Bali&lt;/a&gt; later this week to urge world leaders to meet as often as every three months to enact a global cap on greenhouse gas emissions by 2010.

Gore shared the 2007 Nobel prize with the &lt;a href="w%3AIPCC"&gt;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change&lt;/a&gt;, represented at today's ceremony by &lt;a href="w%3ARajendra%20Pachauri"&gt;Rajendra Pachauri&lt;/a&gt;.

Pachauri stressed the link between the fight against climate change and peace. He warned that severe climate change will trigger what he called "dramatic population migration," as well as war over water and other resources.

He also warned that up to 250 million people in &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; could face what he called "increased water stress because of climate change.

So far at least 15 people have died in a major ice storm in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; which has left more than 600,000 residents and businesses across three states, without electricity. Officials for the utility companies say that this could be the worst ice storm in history.

"This particular storm is now the worst in company history in terms of customers affected," said Oklahoma Gas and Electric spokesman, Brian Alford.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Weather%20Service"&gt;National Weather Service&lt;/a&gt; (NWS) has ice storm warnings still in effect for &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Oklahoma"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Kansas"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Missouri"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Iowa"&gt;Iowa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Illinois"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt; where as much as one inch of ice can accumulate on outdoor surfaces.

A State of Emergency has already been declared in Missouri with Governor &lt;a href="w%3AMatt%20Blunt"&gt;Matt Blunt&lt;/a&gt; saying "we are only just beginning to see the devastation from this series of storms." &lt;a href="w%3ABowling%20Green%2C%20Missouri"&gt;Bowling Green&lt;/a&gt; has already seen nearly two to three inches of ice since Saturday December 8. Most other areas of Missouri have received 1/2 inch to one inch of ice.

Illinois has also seen accumulation, with the greatest total of one inch received in &lt;a href="w%3APoplar%20Grove%2C%20Illinois"&gt;Poplar Grove&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AEdna%2C%20Kansas"&gt;Edna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AColumbus%2C%20Kansas"&gt;Columbus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APittsburg%2C%20Kansas"&gt;Pittsburg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIndependence%2C%20Kansas"&gt;Independence&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AHutchinson%2C%20Kansas"&gt;Hutchinson&lt;/a&gt;, Kansas have all received at least one inch of ice along with parts of Texas and Oklahoma.

The NWS says that more storms are on the way and more ice is likely across the same regions.

"A series of low pressure centers have brought ice and snow from the Rockies, Southern Plains, to the Midwest and portions of the Northeast. Several additional disturbances and the presence of shallow Arctic air will continue to bring bouts of freezing rain, sleet, and snow from the Southwest to the Plains States, Midwest, and Northeast over the next several days," said a statement on the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Oceanic%20and%20Atmospheric%20Administration"&gt;NWS&lt;/a&gt;'s website.

For the first time in over a half a &lt;a href="w%3Acentury"&gt;century&lt;/a&gt;, regular train service hosting cargo crossed between &lt;a href="North%20Korea"&gt;North&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South&lt;/a&gt; Korea.

The train is 12 cars long and is carrying building materials to &lt;a href="w%3AKaesong"&gt;Kaesong&lt;/a&gt;, a key industrial junction for the two countries. The train will head back immediately after unloading. The service will continue at least once every week day.

South Korean leaders say that cargo trains are just a start, although North Korea will not allow anything beyond cargo as of yet. "Though we start with a cargo train, it will lead to a passenger train service and will soon be linked to the continental trains," said Korean Railroad President, Lee Chul to the press.

Buses, cars, and trucks are allowed across the border, but trains have not been until now. The roads which allowed those types of vehicles to enter North Korea were rebuilt after the first summit held between the two nations in 2000. The rail lines were destroyed in the 1950s during the &lt;a href="w%3AKorean%20War"&gt;Korean War&lt;/a&gt;.

The agreement to allow a cargo service was reached in October when the two nations met for a historical second summit.

<h1>Two car bombs kill scores in Algiers, Algeria</h1>

Two bombs have exploded in &lt;a href="Algiers"&gt;Algiers&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of &lt;a href="Algeria"&gt;Algeria&lt;/a&gt;, killing at least 67 people. Both explosions were car bombs, at least one of which is being called a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Asuicide%20attack"&gt;suicide bombing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The first explosion took place in the Ben Aknoun district in the center of the city, which is near the constitutional court. The second was near the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; offices in the Hydra neighborhood. A UN worker said to the BBC that the building has partially collapsed and people may be trapped inside.

Jean Fabre, of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Development%20Programme"&gt;United Nations Development Programme&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , said that 10 staff members had been killed by the bomb which was outside the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20High%20Commissioner%20for%20Refugees"&gt;United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's offices.

Several of the victims in the Ben Aknoun attack were students who were in a passing bus.

Officials believe that the attacks were carried out by The &lt;a href="al-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; Organization in the Islamic Maghreb, which was previously known as the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat and sometimes still referred to as such.
Algiers suffered a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A11%20April%202007%20Algiers%20bombings"&gt;similar attack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on April 11 of this year when two suicide car bombers claimed the lives of 33 people. According to Reuters, some people in Algeria have begun to speculate that the attacks on the 11th of the month is an homage to the &lt;a href="September%2011%20attacks"&gt;September 11&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.

Anis Rahmani, security expert and editor of a local paper, told Reuters that "al Qaeda wanted to send a strong message that it is still capable despite the lost of several top leaders. Now the key problem is that social conditions are still offering chances for terrorists to hire new rebels."

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Secretary-General"&gt;United Nations Secretary-General&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="Ban%20Ki-moon"&gt;Ban Ki-moon&lt;/a&gt; condemned the attacks while in &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href="2007%20United%20Nations%20Climate%20Change%20Conference"&gt;2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference&lt;/a&gt;: "This is just unacceptable. I would like to condemn it in the strongest terms. It cannot be justified in any circumstances." 

&lt;a href="Nicolas%20Sarkozy"&gt;Nicolas Sarkozy&lt;/a&gt;, the President of &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, who recently visited Algeria, called the attacks "barbaric, hateful and deeply cowardly acts." 

"President Sarkozy has just called President &lt;a href="Abdelaziz%20Bouteflika"&gt;Bouteflika&lt;/a&gt; to express the French people's solidarity and compassion towards the Algerian people," said presidential spokesperson David Martinon.

White House spokesperson Gordon Johndroe said: "The United States stands with the people of Algeria, as well as the United Nations, as they deal with this senseless violence."

The Algerian Prime Minister &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAbdelaziz%20Belkhadem"&gt;Abdelaziz Belkhadem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; called off a cabinet meeting to allow him to visit the injured in the hospital.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFabio%20Capello"&gt;Fabio Capello&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has emerged as the new favourite to succeed &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20McClaren"&gt;Steve McClaren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as the &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; football team's new head coach after &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9%20Mourinho"&gt;José Mourinho&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ruled himself out of taking the job. 

The former Chelsea manager had been widely regarded as a favourite for the job but after he admitted yesterday that he is no longer interested in it, Capello became the new favourite.

The &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt;, who has previously managed &lt;a href="Real%20Madrid"&gt;Real Madrid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAC%20Milan"&gt;AC Milan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJuventus"&gt;Juventus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AA.S.%20Roma"&gt;Roma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , would regard the England job as the highlight of his career according to sources close to him and is ready to open talks.

Other candidates for the job include fellow Italian &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMarcello%20Lippi"&gt;Marcello Lippi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , former Germany coach &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJurgen%20Klinsmann"&gt;Jurgen Klinsmann&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAston%20Villa"&gt;Aston Villa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; manager &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20O%27Neill"&gt;Martin O'Neill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADuncan%20Hunter"&gt;Duncan Hunter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is an &lt;a href="US"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; politician who has been a Republican member of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; since 1981 from &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;'s 52nd congressional district in northern and eastern &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Diego%2C%20California"&gt;San Diego&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . It was previously numbered the 42nd District from 1981 to 1983 and then the 45th District from 1983 to 1993. Hunter was the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee during the 109th Congress. Hunter is currently seeking the Republican Party nomination for President of the United States. Below is 's interview with the Congressman.
<h2>Running for President</h2>
♡❤♡How do you handle juggling running the Presidential campaign, acting as a Congressman, and as a husband?

♡❤♡Do you ever at night say to yourself, “I can’t believe I am finding the energy for another day of this.”

♡❤♡[♡❤Laughs♡❤] That can’t help the sleep deprivation, though.

♡❤♡Good point.

<h2>Immigration and the U.S.-Mexico border fence</h2>
♡❤♡Presumably the primary reason one typically gives to run for President is because they think they can win and do some good things for the country, but would you say the second reason after that is for a chance to frame the debate on the issues?

♡❤♡The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIsraeli%20West%20Bank%20barrier"&gt;fence that was built in Israel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is seen by many as divisive in an area that is far more explosive than the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMexico"&gt;Mexican&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -U.S. border. How do you respond to people who say that a fence is more symbolic of divisiveness than a resolution of the issues that cause &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIllegal%20immigration%20to%20the%20United%20States"&gt;illegal immigration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ?

♡❤♡Is a fence the remedy for that, or is finding a remedy for the needs and causes of those gangs and for the illegal migration of people a remedy? 

♡❤♡What were they coming here to do?

♡❤♡Where did they come from?

<h2>Concentrating the political power in Congressional redistricting</h2>
♡❤♡ You were originally elected as part of the Reagan Revolution and you came from a historically competitive district—

♡❤♡ But you won! So it sounds competitive.

♡❤♡Districts nationwide have become solidly leaning toward one party or another. Do you think that since our districts are being drawn in ways—and both parties do this—in ways that ensure one party wins, do you think that hurts our democracy?

♡❤♡ &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACongressional%20stagnation%20in%20the%20United%20States"&gt;But studies have shown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that districts ♡❤have♡❤ become more concentrated, that the votes have become more lopsided toward one party, whereas it used to be more that you would find percentages of 47/53, whereas now it is 60/40 or 65/35. You consistently win more than 60-70% of the vote in your district. 

♡❤♡ But then they changed it. 

♡❤♡ Don’t you think this is a problem we have in the country with both parties doing it?

<h2>Iran and nuclear capabilities</h2>
♡❤♡ The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Intelligence%20Estimate"&gt;National Intelligence Estimate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; came out that Iran has not had a nuclear weapons program in years, but the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush%20Administration"&gt;Bush Administration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has been warning us that Iran is a threat. Do you think these two pieces of information hurt our international standing?

♡❤♡ But the &lt;a href="International%20Atomic%20Energy%20Agency"&gt;IAEA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Mohamed%20ElBaradei"&gt;Mohamed ElBaradei&lt;/a&gt; have also come out and said that the National Intelligence Estimate jibes with their findings.

♡❤♡ Isn’t that just conjecture?

♡❤♡ But there is no evidence that they are making any weapons with them, correct?

<h2>Terrorism: the greatest threat to humanity</h2>

♡❤♡ What do you think is the greatest threat to humanity?

♡❤♡ You think terrorism is the greatest threat to humanity?

I think that’s the greatest—

♡❤♡ Are you for nuclear non-proliferation, then?

♡❤♡ What is technology control?

♡❤♡ Do you think we should begin entering into agreements with other countries to disarm the nuclear arsenal worldwide?

♡❤♡ It seems like it is a difficult thing to argue that we have nuclear arms, but other sovereign nations can’t have them.

♡❤♡ Does it not worry you that governments can change quickly? You had Shah Pahlavi, who was very pro-Western for a long time, overthrown in Iran. President Musharraf in Pakistan, which now has nuclear weapons, is also unstable with his hold on power and has nuclear capabilities. 

<h2>The United Nations</h2>
♡❤♡ You are a critic of the United Nations and it would seem like out of any foreign body that is positioned to assume global leadership on this issue, it would be the UN. Do you think it is wise to take an antagonistic view of that body when it seems necessary to have the global cooperation it embodies?

♡❤♡ One of the things you said was, “Rest assured no treaty that infringes the sovereignty of the United States…” 

♡❤♡ That’s not an accurate quote?

♡❤♡ If you’re concerned about infringing on the sovereignty of the United States, but the concern doesn’t extend for the sovereignty of other countries, how do you form a foreign policy principle that doesn’t make it seem the concern is only what is good for us?

<h2>[♡❤Break for Congressman Hunter to attend a conference♡❤]</h2>
♡❤♡ Hi Congressman Hunter. How was the meeting?

♡❤♡ That happens a lot where they put disparate bills together in the hopes of moving them together. What are some of the positives and what are some of the negatives of doing that? 

<h2>School prayer</h2>
♡❤♡You support school prayer?

♡❤♡Not a school mandated prayer?

♡❤♡More a moment of silence?

<h2>Pornography</h2>
♡❤♡ You sponsored the Parents Empowerment Act--

♡❤♡ That Act would allow parents or guardians to sue in federal court anyone that disseminates material harmful to minors.

♡❤♡ Can you explain how that does not limit free speech, especially on the Internet?

♡❤♡ What about a pornographic website?

♡❤♡ Are there any studies that show it actually harms children?

♡❤♡ I've spent time in Europe, and I have spent time here. It depends on what you are saying pornography is. For instance, in Europe women are allowed to be bare-chested on the beach or in some places on television. It doesn't seem to harm children there.

♡❤♡ Sure, but what is the bar for pornography, then?

♡❤♡ Would a website with a message at the front saying that a user confirms they are over 18 before they enter the site, would that be sufficient?

♡❤♡ They also try to avoid the X label.

<h2>Gay Marriage</h2>
♡❤♡ Do you consider yourself States Rights?

♡❤♡ Why would you support the Federal Marriage Amendment if you are for States Rights?

♡❤♡ Doesn't DOMA prevent that? The Defense of Marriage Act?

♡❤♡ But didn't DOMA prevent that? Massachusetts currently has gay marriage. So didn't DOMA prevent that from happening?

♡❤♡ Prevent a swell of people going to Massachusetts and getting married, and then taking their marriage to another state that bans it and forcing them to recognize it? 

♡❤♡ So do you no longer support amending the Constitution is my question.

♡❤♡ Essentially you would want to revoke Massachusetts' ability to have gay marriage?

♡❤♡ So that would be anti-States rights to a degree?

♡❤♡ Why do you think gay marriage is one of those issues?

♡❤♡ How does gay marriage devalue marriage?

♡❤♡ Although we are not a Christian nation--

♡❤♡ The argument against that is should government be involved in it ♡❤at all♡❤ then.

♡❤♡ What about when two Muslims marry, then? Because that's not Judeo-Christian.

♡❤♡ Since it exists in all societies, just because it is practiced by a Judeo-Christian society does that make it a Judeo-Christian institution or a human institution?

♡❤♡ You don't believe that?

♡❤♡ Some Christian churches such as the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEpiscopalians"&gt;Episcopalians&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; conduct gay marriages.

Several central banks in &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="North%20America"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt; announced joint efforts to provide liquidity to the credit markets in the wake of the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20subprime%20mortgage%20financial%20crisis"&gt;2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis&lt;/a&gt;. The banks will hold coordinated auctions "designed to address elevated pressures in short-term funding markets." The announcement came simutaneously from all of the banks at 9:00 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Time%20Zone%20%28North%20America%29"&gt;EST&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC-5"&gt;UTC-5&lt;/a&gt;).

The banks involved are the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Reserve%20System"&gt;Federal Reserve System&lt;/a&gt; (Fed), the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Central%20Bank"&gt;European Central Bank&lt;/a&gt; (ECB), the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ABank%20of%20England"&gt;Bank of England&lt;/a&gt; (BoE), &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ABank%20of%20Canada"&gt;Bank of Canada&lt;/a&gt; (BoC), and &lt;a href="Switzerland"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ASwiss%20National%20Bank"&gt;Swiss National Bank&lt;/a&gt; (SNB).

The auctions will run through the end of 2007. The first auction is scheduled for Monday, December 17 and will be a "Term Auction Facility" of &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;20 billion.

In its statement the Federal Reserve said: "The Federal Open Market Committee has authorized temporary reciprocal currency arrangements (swap lines) with the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Swiss National Bank (SNB). These arrangements will provide dollars in amounts of up to $20 billion and $4 billion to the ECB and the SNB, respectively, for use in their jurisdictions. The FOMC approved these swap lines for a period of up to six months."

The &lt;a href="w%3ABank%20of%20Japan"&gt;Bank of Japan&lt;/a&gt; (BoJ) is not participating in the intervention, but welcomed the action. In its official statement, the BoJ said: "The Bank of Japan welcomes these measures and hopes that they will contribute to maintaining the functioning of the international financial markets."

Police officers and officials at an emergency meeting have voted to ballot every &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; police officer over the right to strike. They also called for the home secretary, &lt;a href="w%3AJacqui%20Smith"&gt;Jacqui Smith&lt;/a&gt;, to resign over the current dispute and further passed a vote of no confidence in the home secretary's ability to deal with pay and conditions.

Under current UK law, it is illegal for police officers to stage walk outs as part of protests or disputes, however some members of the force want to strike over the pay package dispute and thus are lobbying for the right to strike to be allowed once again. This has also been supported by a petition, started by &lt;a href="w%3AKeith%20Vaz"&gt;Keith Vaz&lt;/a&gt;, chair of the home affairs select committee, which has been signed by 78 &lt;a href="w%3AMP"&gt;MPs&lt;/a&gt;.

This comes after the decision by the UK government not to backdate a 2.5% pay rise to September 2007, leading to a loss of income, from &lt;a href="w%3APound%20sterling"&gt;£&lt;/a&gt;130 - £264. However the government says that this is necessary to control inflation in the UK.

On Wednesday at 12:40 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20European%20Time"&gt;CET&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC%2B1"&gt;UTC+1&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="Norway"&gt;Norwegian&lt;/a&gt; authorities were alerted to an oil spill in the &lt;a href="w%3AStatfjord%20oil%20field"&gt;Statfjord oil field&lt;/a&gt;. The spill originated from the &lt;a href="w%3Aoil%20platform"&gt;oil platform&lt;/a&gt; "Statfjord A", one of three platforms in the field, operated by &lt;a href="w%3AStatoilHydro"&gt;StatoilHydro&lt;/a&gt;.

Kristin Hoffmann of Petroleum Safety Authority Norway (♡❤Petroleumtilsynet♡❤) told ♡❤Dagens Nyheter♡❤: "This is the second largest in Norwegian history." The amount of oil released into the sea is believed to be at least 3840 &lt;a href="w%3ACubic%20metre"&gt;cubic metres&lt;/a&gt;, 25,000 &lt;a href="w%3ABarrel%23Oil_barrel"&gt;barrels&lt;/a&gt;, or approximately 4,000 &lt;a href="w%3ATonne"&gt;metric tons&lt;/a&gt;. This amount would rank the spill low on the &lt;a href="w%3Alist%20of%20oil%20spills"&gt;list of oil spills&lt;/a&gt;.

"It is a significant amount and we are taking it seriously," said Vegar Stokset, a spokesman for StatoilHydro, though he said the spill was "very far from land." 

The accident occurred in rough seas while tanker ♡❤Navion Britannia♡❤ was loading oil from a storage buoy, StatoilHydro said. Christian Sletner of the &lt;a href="w%3ANorwegian%20Coastal%20Administration"&gt;Norwegian Coastal Administration&lt;/a&gt; said, "StatoilHydro has a good preparedness plan, and a satisfactory system for handling this." He added, "StatoilHydro is responsible for cleaning up. This is the 'polluter pays' principle."

"The amount of damage could range from completely marginal to relatively large if substantial amounts reach land," Sletner said. "The chances of it reaching land, at the moment, seem to be relatively small."

No one was injured at the time of the accident and the platform will continue work as usual Thursday, said StatiolHydro Information Director Kai Nielsen. In a press release, StatiolHydro announced that four vessels are on their way to begin the clean-up, though they will have to wait for calmer seas to begin work.

Petroleum Safety Authority Norway said in a press release that it is demobilizing disaster teams and beginning to prepare for its investigation of the incident. It will also closely follow StatoilHydro's clean-up.

Statfjord is 200 &lt;a href="w%3Akilometre"&gt;km&lt;/a&gt; (124 &lt;a href="w%3Amile"&gt;miles&lt;/a&gt;) off the coast of Norway, located to the east of &lt;a href="w%3ABergen"&gt;Bergen&lt;/a&gt;. It is an oil and gas field in the Norwegian sector of the &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Sea"&gt;North Sea&lt;/a&gt;, though approximately 15% of it is in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;'s waters. At peak production, it produces over 700,000 barrels of oil per day. The field is one of the largest known under-sea oil fields in the world.

<h1>Israeli and Palestinian negotiators meet formally</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Israeli%20and%20Palestinian%20negotiators%20meet%20formally&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The first formal meeting between &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;i and &lt;a href="Palestine"&gt;Palestinian&lt;/a&gt; negotiators since last month's &lt;a href="w%3AAnnapolis%20Conference"&gt;Annapolis, Maryland peace conference&lt;/a&gt;, ended in &lt;a href="wiktionary%3Aacrimony"&gt;acrimony&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday with both sides accusing each other of acting in bad faith on a host of issues.

The 90-minute meeting was supposed to open with a ceremony celebrating the beginning of formal peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians. But the talks had to be rescheduled and moved to a secret location after it became apparent that the two sides had little to discuss. 

&lt;a href="w%3AAryeh%20Mekel"&gt;Aryeh Mekel&lt;/a&gt;, the spokesman for the &lt;a href="w%3AForeign%20Affairs%20Minister%20of%20Israel"&gt;Israeli Foreign Ministry&lt;/a&gt; says both sides had grievances to air.

"The Palestinians chose to use this occasion to raise grievances. Basically our delegation led by Foreign Minister Livni expressed the need for Palestinians to take urgent action vis-à-vis the security situation and she mentioned the attacks from Gaza," said Mekel. "As you know today there were more than 20 Qassam rockets fired at Sderot and its vicinity. Also she mentioned the lack of security in the West Bank where only two weeks ago, two Palestinian policemen shot and killed an Israeli resident."

Just two weeks ago, Israeli Prime Minister &lt;a href="Ehud%20Olmert"&gt;Ehud Olmert&lt;/a&gt; and Palestinian President &lt;a href="Mahmoud%20Abbas"&gt;Mahmoud Abbas&lt;/a&gt; pledged to re-start peace talks aimed at reaching a comprehensive settlement by the end of next year. But since then continued Palestinian rocket attacks from &lt;a href="w%3AGaza"&gt;Gaza&lt;/a&gt;, and Israel's decision to build 300 homes in an &lt;a href="w%3AArab"&gt;Arab&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Jerusalem"&gt;East Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt; neighborhood known as &lt;a href="w%3AHar%20Homa"&gt;Har Homa&lt;/a&gt;, have soured the atmosphere.

Palestinian negotiator &lt;a href="w%3ASaeb%20Erekat"&gt;Saeb Erekat&lt;/a&gt; says Israel has to choose between settlements and peace with the Palestinians.

Erekat says the Palestinians main point of discussion in their talks with Israel was the planned construction of 300 homes in the Har Homa, East Jerusalem neighborhood. He also says they raised the issue of Israeli military activities in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

Tuesday, Israeli troops launched a ground incursion into Gaza — the largest such operation since June, when Hamas militants seized control of the territory from Fatah forces loyal to moderate Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.

The issue of Palestinian rocket fire from the &lt;a href="w%3AGaza%20Strip"&gt;Gaza Strip&lt;/a&gt; into southern Israel is raising concerns of a wider Israeli military offensive in Gaza. But Israel's army chief says his forces will focus on carrying out limited operations in the territory and avoid a broader invasion.

Meanwhile, the mayor of the Israeli town of &lt;a href="w%3ASderot"&gt;Sderot&lt;/a&gt;, which has borne the brunt of the rocket fire, resigned saying he could not carry out his duties as long as the attacks continue.

<h1>Greenhouse-gas emission targets may come later says Ban Ki-moon</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Greenhouse-gas%20emission%20targets%20may%20come%20later%20says%20Ban%20Ki-moon&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; secretary-general, &lt;a href="Ban%20Ki-moon"&gt;Ban Ki-moon&lt;/a&gt; says setting &lt;a href="w%3Agreenhouse%20gas"&gt;greenhouse-gas&lt;/a&gt; emission targets may have to wait until after the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20United%20Nations%20Climate%20Change%20Conference"&gt;U.N. Climate Change Conference&lt;/a&gt; being held in &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Bali&lt;/a&gt;.

U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon told reporters it may be too "ambitious" to set targets for greenhouse-gas emissions in the draft text of an agreement aimed at replacing the &lt;a href="w%3AKyoto%20Protocol"&gt;Kyoto Protocol&lt;/a&gt; to stop &lt;a href="w%3Aglobal%20warming"&gt;global warming&lt;/a&gt;.

Delegates from about 190 nations, now holding high-level meetings, are split over whether targets should be set now or later. Mr. Ban recognizes the divisions.

"Frankly speaking, realistically, it may be too ambitious if delegates would expect to be able to agree on target of greenhouse gas emission reduction," he said. "But, as I told you, some time down the road we will have to agree on that."

Ministers and heads of states, in a series of speeches, urged nations to lower greenhouse gas emissions. These gases, particularly those caused by the burning of &lt;a href="w%3Afossil%20fuels"&gt;fuels&lt;/a&gt;, are believed by many scientists to contribute to global warming.

Leaders said rich nations should make the first cuts and help poorer nations to develop clean technology.

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; strongly opposes emission targets, as do &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;. U.S. officials say including emission targets would prejudge negotiations expected over the next two years to find a replacement for the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2012.

But the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; and environmentalists say setting emission targets in the draft will show that industrialized nations are serious about the fight against global warming.

The U.S. under-secretary of state for democracy and global affairs, &lt;a href="w%3APaula%20Dobriansky"&gt;Paula Dobriansky&lt;/a&gt;, who is heading the U.S. delegation to Bali, says &lt;a href="w%3AWashington"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; is committed to seeing an agreement reached at the Bali conference.

"We are very committed to working toward a successful outcome here in Bali. We want to launch a process that is open and does not predetermine or preclude options," she said. "We have been listening carefully to the perspectives of others and will continue to do so in the days ahead. We hope to identify a way forward that will bridge our differences and bring us together on common pursuit of our shared goal of addressing climate change."

The text of the conference draft is expected to undergo several revisions before being finalized Friday. It calls for industrialized nations to commit to cutting greenhouse gas emissions by between 25 to 40 percent by the year 2020.

The Bali conference is expected to end on Friday.

At least two new outbreaks of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="Avian%20Flu"&gt;Avian Flu&lt;/a&gt; virus, also known as Bird Flu, have been found in &lt;a href="Poland"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;.

One of the outbreaks was on a farm in Saldowo which affected at least 40 chickens. The other outbreak was found in unnamed wild birds near &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOrneta"&gt;Orneta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

"The new case was discovered in the village of Saldowo, near to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABie%C5%BCu%C5%84"&gt;Bieżuń&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , (central Poland) close to other recent cases. Just as in the previous cases all the chickens will be culled," said Poland's Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMarek%20Sawicki"&gt;Marek Sawicki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Officials have set up a zone of protection of at least a 30 kilometer radius of the farm.

Former &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Canada"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABrian%20Mulroney"&gt;Brian Mulroney&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; testified Thursday before an ethics committee in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20House%20of%20Commons"&gt;Canadian House of Commons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; about the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAirbus%20affair"&gt;Airbus affair&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a case involving alleged bribery at the highest levels of government to secure &lt;a href="Airbus"&gt;Airbus&lt;/a&gt; sales of aircraft to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAir%20Canada"&gt;Air Canada&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

In his testimony, Mulroney said that he should not have associated with &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; businessman &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKarlheinz%20Schreiber"&gt;Karlheinz Schreiber&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; nor should have he accepted bundles of cash — which he placed in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASafe%20deposit%20box"&gt;safe deposit boxes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in two different countries.

Nonetheless, Mulroney denied accepting &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Akickbacks"&gt;kickbacks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . He admitted taking about &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20dollar"&gt;CAD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 225,000 in cash from Schreiber in 1993 and 1994, which was after his departure from politics. He also said that the money involved promoting Schreiber's private business dealings.

To the committee Muroney said: "When I look back on it today, I realize I made a serious error of judgment in receiving a payment in cash for this assignment even though it was decidedly not illegal to do so. That mistake in judgment was mine alone. I apologize and I accept full responsibility for it. ... I should have declined the offer. I should have insisted that payment be in a more transparent or more accountable manner. By not doing so I inadvertently created an impression of impropriety on the high office I was privileged to hold."

"Do you realize, Mr. Mulroney, that the way in which you acted in this matter did not make it appear that it were a legitimate transaction," said MP &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASerge%20M%C3%A9nard"&gt;Serge Ménard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABloc%20Qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois"&gt;Bloc Québécois&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Two days earlier, Schreiber testified before the same committee, alleging that Mulroney agreed to accept CAD300,000 to promote a light armored vehicle factory and benefited from the purchase of 34 Airbus aircraft by Air Canada.

"I never received a cent from anyone for services rendered to anyone in connection with the purchase by Air Canada from Airbus of 34 aircraft," Mulroney said, refuting Schreiber.

Mulroney also attacked Schreiber's credibility, pointing out that the German could be &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aextradition"&gt;extradited&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to his home country where he faces charges. "He succeeded. He got what he wanted ... he’s sitting in his mansion over in Rockcliffe," Mulroney said. "I think he seriously misled every member of this House ... with this false affidavit."

The committee's investigation will resume in late January, when it is expected to call dozens of witnesses.

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; musician and songwriter, &lt;a href="w%3AIke%20Turner"&gt;Ike Turner&lt;/a&gt;, who was married at least 14 times, died Wednesday at his home in &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Marcos%2C%20California"&gt;San Marcos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;. His wife did not give a cause of death, but mentioned that he suffered from &lt;a href="w%3Aemphysema"&gt;emphysema&lt;/a&gt;.

Ike Turner was perhaps best known as one half of the &lt;a href="w%3AIke%20%26amp%3B%20Tina%20Turner"&gt;Ike &amp; Tina Turner&lt;/a&gt; duo, with his former wife, &lt;a href="w%3ATina%20Turner"&gt;Tina Turner&lt;/a&gt;, whom he married in &lt;a href="Mexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; in 1962. During a career that lasted half a century, Ike's repertoire included blues, soul, rock, and funk. Alongside his former wife, he was inducted to the &lt;a href="w%3ARock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame"&gt;Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; in 1991 and in 2001 was inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame.

After almost two weeks of negotiations, this years United Nations Convention on Climate Change (&lt;a href="w%3AUNFCCC"&gt;UNCCC&lt;/a&gt;) is soon going to end, Friday being scheduled as the last day of the talks, with an extension until Saturday being possible if agreement can not be reached beforehand. 

While the head of the UNFCCC Secretariat, Yvo de Boer, stressed from the onset that actual targets for emission reductions were not to be expected to be agreed on, the inclusion of a target frame for industrialized nations is being debated after all. However, his stated goal of deciding on a &lt;a href="w%3Aroadmap"&gt;roadmap&lt;/a&gt; for negotiations, which he said needed to address the matter of (GHG) emissions reductions after 2012, and would have to be concluded by 2009, is not yet achieved, there being disagreement on a matter of points.

&lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; for example restated a position it had made at the beginning of the first week, calling for 2010 as target year for the so called "Bali Roadmap". 

But a bigger point of contention is that the EU and the vast majority of the 190 nations participating in the conference want to set a target of a 25-40% cut in GHG emissions. The U.S., along with Canada and Japan, are refusing to agree to any targets at this point.

The EU and others say it is important to set targets now, to get a head start in the fight against global warming. The U.S. says targets should come later, after negotiations begin.

The latest to be heard by Sean Heron, who is reporting on behalf of the Wikinews on site, regarding the ongoing negotiations was a statement by a Pakistani official, saying that the US had made a new proposal, and that he was feeling more optimistic than he had the day before. The official spoke in the press conference room, excusing the Ambassador Munir Akram, who was supposed to give a briefing on behalf of the &lt;a href="w%3AGroup%20of%2077%20and%20China"&gt;Group of 77 and China&lt;/a&gt;, but couldn't make it, as negotiations, due also to the new American suggestion, were still ongoing at 11 pm local time.

Recent scans on the planet &lt;a href="w%3ASaturn"&gt;Saturn&lt;/a&gt; by the space probe &lt;a href="w%3ACassini%E2%80%93Huygens"&gt;Cassini–Huygens&lt;/a&gt; have shown that the planet's rings are much older than previously thought. Recent data says they may be as old as the solar system itself.

The new scans have indicated that the rings are likely three to five billion years old, and will probably be around for billions of years longer. Scientists previously thought the rings to be only about 100 million years old.

"Despite what was thought after the [1970s] Voyager investigations of Saturn - that Saturn's rings might be very youthful, perhaps only as ancient as the dinosaurs - we have results that show the rings could have lasted as long as the Solar System and maybe will be around for billions of years. Recycling allows the rings to be as old as the solar system although continually changing," said researcher Professor Larry Esposito.

The determination was made when Cassini's Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) analyzed the light from the &lt;a href="w%3ASun"&gt;Sun&lt;/a&gt; reflecting off particles in the rings of all different sizes. The data had shown that there was a lot more clumpy material and as much as three times more mass than what was previously found in the &lt;a href="w%3AVoyager%20program"&gt;Voyager missions&lt;/a&gt;.

Scientists assumed that particles from an exploding comet may have caused the rings to form, but the new data says that it is unlikely to be the case, because the particles are all of different ages.

"Although the Voyager observations indicated Saturn's rings were youthful, Cassini shows even younger ages; and because we see such transient, dynamic phenomena in the rings we are able to reach the paradoxical conclusion - because the rings appear so young, they may actually be as old as the Solar System," added Esposito.

Cassini is operated jointly by &lt;a href="NASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Space%20Agency"&gt;European Space Agency&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AStavros%20Dimas"&gt;Stavros Dimas&lt;/a&gt; at a press conference today stated that the &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; would not view it as necessary to attend the &lt;a href="w%3Amajor%20emitters%20meeting"&gt;major emitters meeting&lt;/a&gt; (MEM) if no substantial agreement was reached at the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20United%20Nations%20Climate%20Change%20Conference"&gt;climate change conference&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Bali&lt;/a&gt;. His statement was made after being asked about rumours of the EU boycotting the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; held MEM. He said that he had mentioned the preceding point of view in the presence of an under-secretary of the US government at a business breakfast this morning. He answered to a later question that he felt disappointed at the current stance of the US government, and wished clarity for the moment.

According to a press release by &lt;a href="w%3AGreenpeace"&gt;Greenpeace&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; environmental minister &lt;a href="w%3ASigmar%20Gabriel"&gt;Sigmar Gabriel&lt;/a&gt; also declared to the press that the EU would not be taking part in the scheduled MEM in January if substantial progress was not made. Amongst other points that are currently being discussed, one which is often referred to is that of whether or not a guideline frame for emissions reductions is to be included in the preamble of one of the final documents. The proposed frame is 25-40% cuts in &lt;a href="w%3AGHG"&gt;greenhouse gas&lt;/a&gt; emissions for industrialized nations (known as Annex I nations in UNFCCC parlance), from 1990 baselines. The US is amongst the relatively small number of nations, including Canada and Japan, that are opposed to this.

Asked what he knew of the matter at an earlier press conference, &lt;a href="w%3AYvo%20de%20Boer"&gt;Yvo de Boer&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AUNFCCC"&gt;UNFCCC&lt;/a&gt; stated that Stavros Dimas, the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Commissioner%20for%20the%20Environment"&gt;European Commissioner for the Environment&lt;/a&gt;, had voiced his opinion that if no agreement is reached now, than there would be no need for the Major Emitting nations meeting to be held, because, so he apparently stated, the MEM is meant to feed into the UN process, and you could not feed something into nothing.

The talks being held in Bali are expected to lead to a roadmap for negotiations on greenhouse gas emissions caps for after 2012, which is when the current first phase of the &lt;a href="w%3AKyoto%20protocol"&gt;Kyoto protocol&lt;/a&gt; is going to run out. Multiple parties, observers, and the top &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; executive of the Climate Change branch all had expressed their hope that this roadmap would also include a target date of 2009 for the conclusion of negotiations. The major emitters meeting is a convention of those nations that have the greatest greenhouse gas emissions, and was held for the first time at the invitation of the US in Autumn this year.

Although the &lt;a href="2007%20Taipei%20IT%20Month"&gt;2007 Taipei IT Month&lt;/a&gt; closed last Sunday (December 9), it attracted more than 750,000 people to visit the show, but it exposed some problems especially on the traffic factor.

Generally on weekdays (December 3-7), the traffic jam at Shi-fu Road often took place in the afternoon as many schools visited the show and several sightseeing buses sometimes parked there for patronages on students. In comparison with Sung-shou Road, Shi-fu Road was sometimes obstructed but not as serious than on weekends because the official shuttle buses played a key role on transportation.

On the opposite way of two weekends (December 1, 2, 8, and 9), it exposed traffic problems as many people visited the show, even though the Traffic Division of Taipei City Police Department set medians around the &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20World%20Trade%20Center"&gt;Taipei World Trade Center&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20101"&gt;Taipei 101&lt;/a&gt;, and it apparently decreased violations on illegal crossing, Shi-fu Road and Sung-shou Road were still trapped in traffic jams than on weekdays.

Before the launch of the &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20World%20Trade%20Center%20Nangang%20Exhibition%20Hall"&gt;TWTC Nangang&lt;/a&gt; in March 2008, governments and show organizers will focus on the traffic issue at the Taipei World Trade Center during the construction of the MRT Taipei World Trade Center Station.

&lt;a href="w%3AGarry%20Kasparov"&gt;Garry Kasparov&lt;/a&gt;, the world champion &lt;a href="w%3Achess"&gt;chess-player&lt;/a&gt; turned political activist, says he will not contest the &lt;a href="w%3ARussian%20presidential%20election%2C%202008"&gt;2008 presidential election&lt;/a&gt; in March. Kasparov says that he is forced to withdraw from the race because his political group, &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Other%20Russia"&gt;The Other Russia&lt;/a&gt; has been unable to hold a nominating convention.

"In all Moscow we have not been able to find a hall where our supporters could meet," Kasparov said. "We pay and the people agree. There are no problems. And then they call us to say they are refusing, can't give us the hall any more," he continued. "They refuse to give us the hall for technical reasons." 

Kasparov's campaign had previously run into a variety of other problems including police crackdowns and censorship. In one incident, Andrei Novikov, a reporter critical of the government and supportive of Kasparov, was detained for nine months in a psychiatric hospital. 

&lt;a href="w%3AReporters%20Without%20Borders"&gt;Reporters Without Borders&lt;/a&gt; said of the Novikov incident: "It seems that Russia' special service sand psychiatrists are still empowered to take charge of anyone whose words or actions stray from the Kremlin line." 

Analysts believe that &lt;a href="w%3ADmitri%20Medvedev"&gt;Dmitri Medvedev&lt;/a&gt; will win the March elections after he was endorsed by &lt;a href="Vladimir%20Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt;, who wields tremendous popular support.

<h1>European leaders sign Lisbon Treaty</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=European%20leaders%20sign%20Lisbon%20Treaty&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Today, leaders from the nations of the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; signed the landmark &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AReform%20Treaty"&gt;Treaty of Lisbon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; which is to redefine foreign policy for the EU and creates an EU president. The treaty is a replacement for the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATreaty%20establishing%20a%20Constitution%20for%20Europe"&gt;Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; which was abandoned after suffering defeats in referendums in &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;.

"From this old continent, a new Europe is born," said &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Commission"&gt;European Commission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; President &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9%20Manuel%20Barroso"&gt;José Manuel Barroso&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . "For the first time, the countries that were once divided by a totalitarian curtain, are now united in support of a common treaty that they had themselves negotiated."

The President of &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Nicolas%20Sarkozy"&gt;Nicolas Sarkozy&lt;/a&gt; said to reporters: "Europe was blocked, without knowing how to move forward and we found the solution with this treaty."

&lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="Gordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt; did not attend, and &lt;a href="David%20Miliband"&gt;David Miliband&lt;/a&gt; signed the treaty in his stead. "This is a day for Europe to look to the future.," Miliband said.

Citing prior obligations for his failure to be in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALisbon"&gt;Lisbon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Brown added his signature later after appearing before the House of Commons &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALiaison%20Committee"&gt;Liaison Committee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the morning. Critics have claimed he does "not have the guts" to sign and is trying to avoid the political liability of having his name on the document.

Speaking at the ceremony, &lt;a href="Portugal"&gt;Portuguese&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9%20S%C3%B3crates"&gt;José Sócrates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said, "This was the European project that many generations dreamt of and others before us championed, with a vision of the future."

From here, each country will have to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aratification"&gt;ratify&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; the treaty. Most countries will probably not hold &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Areferendum"&gt;referendums&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on the treaty as voters would be likely to reject the treaty; some leaders have committed to hold referendums, but are attempting to avoid doing so for similar reasons.

The Taipei International Travel Fair (Taipei TVF), founded in 1987 by Taiwan Visitors Association (TVA), is now in its 15th year. This show will start on December 14 and be open through December 17 at the &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20World%20Trade%20Center"&gt;Taipei World Trade Center&lt;/a&gt; with participants from 62 countries and 861 tourism companies and organizations. This year's fair is larger than ever.

At the press conference yesterday, TVA invited some exhibitors including &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;, as well as countries from &lt;a href="w%3ASoutheast%20Asia"&gt;Southeast Asia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Oceania"&gt;Oceania&lt;/a&gt; to promote their traveling packs for media. The TVA recruited local citizen journalists to cover the event, which they also did last year, and awarded honorary press accreditions for the selected 16 nominees.

Before the press conference, ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ reporter had a brief interview with Honorary Chairman of TVA Stanley Chang-shou Yen about their policy on &lt;a href="w%3Acitizen%20journalism"&gt;citizen journalism&lt;/a&gt;. Stanley said:

Besides of some traditional displays by exhibitors at the press conference, Cross-Strait Tourism Exchange Association also introduced the tourism industry of &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; at this conference. With the &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20Summer%20Olympics"&gt;2008 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt; to be held in &lt;a href="w%3ABeijing"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt;, the Cross-Strait Pavilion of Taipei ITF will be a focus of the media in Taiwan, &lt;a href="Hong%20Kong"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; foreign secretary &lt;a href="David%20Miliband"&gt;David Miliband&lt;/a&gt; confirmed today that three British residents, who are being held at the &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20Bay%20detention%20camp"&gt;detention camp&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20Bay%20Naval%20Base"&gt;Guantanamo Bay Naval Base&lt;/a&gt;, will be released by the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.

The three are Jamil el-Banna, of &lt;a href="Jordan"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt;; Omar Deghayes, of &lt;a href="Libya"&gt;Libya&lt;/a&gt;; and Abdennour Sameur, of &lt;a href="Algeria"&gt;Algeria&lt;/a&gt;. They will return "as soon as the practical arrangements can be made," said Miliband.

"Their immigration status will be reviewed following their return, and the same security considerations will apply to them as would apply to any other foreign national in this country. As always, all appropriate steps will be taken to protect national security," the foreign secretary continued.

Miliband said the UK government will work toward getting the US government to close the Guantanamo Bay prison.

♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Register"&gt;The Register&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤, a &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; technology news and opinion website, reports that a former &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWikimedia%20Foundation"&gt;Wikimedia Foundation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChief%20Operating%20Officer"&gt;Chief Operating Officer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (COO) has a criminal record in at least four &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; states: &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Maryland"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Virginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;.

Carolyn Doran, born Carolyn Sue Bothwell, was the WMF COO for six months from January to July 2007. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Register"&gt;The Register&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; reported Doran's criminal record includes four convictions for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Adriving%20under%20the%20influence"&gt;driving under the influence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , two of check fraud and petty larceny, one hit and run with fatality, and one charge of unlawful wounding for shooting former boyfriend Philip L. Brown in the chest in 1990. He later asked that no charges be made against her and they resumed dating each other. Two of the arrests for driving under the influence occurred this year, once in May while she was working for the Foundation and once a month after she resigned.

"He asked me to marry him after I shot him," Doran told ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Washington%20Post"&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ on February 22, 1990.

♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ has confirmed, through &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APinellas%20County%2C%20Florida"&gt;Pinellas County&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; police reports, that she was convicted in four DUI's and also the hit and run. It is also confirmed, she faced an additional charge of driving while a license is suspended or revoked (DWLSR).

In 1994, Doran was implicated in the murder of a man who was the lover of her friend, Cassondra Sue Betancourt. Betancourt was later convicted of the man's first degree murder in 1995 after a jury trial. According to court documents, Betancourt, "brought some cocaine to a hotel room that had been rented by the victim, her lover. The next morning, after defendant left the room, the victim was discovered dead." 

Doran, who had prior knowledge that Betancourt would deliver the drugs, made a plea deal with prosecutors that if she testified against Betancourt, she would get a lesser sentence for her previous charges of credit card fraud and petty larceny. Although Doran assisted the prosecution in attempting to gain incriminating evidence by wearing a wire while with Betancourt, Doran never received her lesser sentence. 

Despite the attempt, Betancourt's conviction was later overturned in 1998 because "there was insufficient evidence to support the conviction. The court held that there had only been circumstantial evidence linking defendant to the crime, and that proof by circumstantial evidence was not sufficient to prove first degree murder," added the court papers.

♡❤Wikinews♡❤ can also confirm that Doran's husband, Sean H. Doran, a former intelligence officer and major for the U.S. Air Force, to whom she was married for only five days, drowned on their honeymoon on &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGrand%20Cayman"&gt;Grand Cayman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the &lt;a href="Cayman%20Islands"&gt;Cayman Islands&lt;/a&gt; in 1999. According to ♡❤The Washington Post♡❤, the cause of the drowning which led to his death was not known. It was later acknowledged in private records given to the Library of Virginia that his death was deemed accidental.

Six months later she remarried after meeting a man named Christopher Dale Confer in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AArapahoe%20County%2C%20Colorado"&gt;Arapahoe County&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Colorado"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt;. It was earlier thought she used Confer as an alias, because according to PACER, she filed for bankruptcy in 2001 where she is listed as having "aliases," one being Carolyn S. King and the other as Carolyn Confer. 

♡❤The Register♡❤ quotes &lt;a href="Mike%20Godwin"&gt;Mike Godwin&lt;/a&gt;, the Wikimedia Foundation's general counsel, as saying that the Foundation had no knowledge of Doran's prior or current criminal record. "We've never had any documentation of any criminal record on Carolyn Doran's part at all. As far as I'm concerned, I have no direct knowledge of [her criminal record] yet...We have, in our records, no evidence of any such thing."

♡❤Wikinews♡❤ attempted to contact Mr. Godwin via e-mail but no response has yet been received. 

Doran was into her COO position by the at the time. Of the seven board members, six supported her position and one did not. The vote was made and agreed upon on January 22, 2007. She was in charge of "all office/administrative issues" and "overall administration and business operations. Areas of responsibility included administration, personnel and fiscal management. In the future, [she will be in charge of] any new employee working in the administrative area," according to public e-mails on Wikimedia's main mailing list ♡❤foundation-l♡❤.

According to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFlorence%20Devouard"&gt;Florence Devouard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the Chair of the WMF Board of Trustees, background checks were not performed on anyone until at least 2007, but that recently, the Foundation began to perform them. During that time, Brad Patrick was acting Executive Director and he did all the hiring.

"In fall 2006, we did not perform criminal background checks. From what I understood, Mike took care of this and this is now being done. It is fairly recent, the board did not get any report on this," said Devouard on ♡❤foundation-l♡❤.

Doran was searched and questioned by U.S. Customs agents in Florida after returning from a Foundation board meeting in the &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; around June. According to ♡❤The Register♡❤, it was because she violated the terms of her parole by attending the meeting. She was not arrested, but according to police reports, on October 31, 2007, Doran was arrested under a warrant valid for a "nationwide extradition". Doran was then extradited back to Virginia, where she is currently being held in a prison in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStaunton%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Staunton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Doran resigned from her position in July 2007, and the Foundation is currently without a Chief Operating Officer.

After the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; agreed to the changes proposed by &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; this morning, the so called ♡❤Bali Roadmap♡❤ has been agreed on, to applause from all parties. The decision was made at this year's &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20United%20Nations%20Climate%20Change%20Conference"&gt;United Nations Climate Change Conference&lt;/a&gt; in Bali. The Roadmap establishes a time frame and scope for reaching a post-2012 climate change agreement. This includes setting, for industrialized nations, targets for reductions of &lt;a href="w%3Agreenhouse%20gas"&gt;greenhouse gas&lt;/a&gt; (GHG) emissions. Numerous observers and parties had voiced that they see this as being of great importance prior to and during the conference.

Following the reopening of the plenary at midday, India reiterated its position that part of a paragraph needed to be reformulated. The &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;EU&lt;/a&gt; went on to state that in the spirit of negotiations, they agreed with the proposed changes. After some further statements by other nations, the US said that they can not accept the changes, as they would considerably change the balance of the text. This was met with loudly audible booing in the plenary. Some time later, after a number of other nations voiced their opinions and the American delegation could be seen busily debating and writing, the US said they would agree to the consensus position after all. Standing ovations and cheers welcomed this change in position, which allowed the President of the Conference soon thereafter to declare the document decided.

India this morning had raised objections on one of the central documents of what constitutes the Roadmap. This had made a decision impossible for the time being, as the conference can only pass items unanimously. The objection regarded the phrasing of how nations with developing industries are to take action to slow and reduce their GHG emissions. The President of the Conference, the Indonesian Environmental Minister, had declined the request, stating that the proposal he had made was very finely balanced. The President had then suspended the session so that further consultations could be made.

No progress was made when the meeting was reopened about an hour later, with &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; stating that negotiations of the so called Group of 77 and China with the Indonesian Minister of Finance were still ongoing. China then accused the &lt;a href="w%3AUNFCCC"&gt;UNFCCC&lt;/a&gt; secretariat of deliberately opening the plenary session at a time it knew that their Ministers were in talks. The Chinese delegate went on to demand an apology by the secretariat, and the meeting was again suspended.

<h3>Yesterday's negotiations</h3>

Ministerial negotiations had continued through the night until the early morning hours yesterday and the climate conference had been scheduled to decide on the last outstanding items this morning.

Yesterday evening Yvo de Boer of the UNFCCC had said that the parties were "on the brink of agreement", when he was asked where negotiations currently stand. With almost all open matters having been agreed on by a group of 40 ministers, one of the last outstanding points then was still the question of guideline numbers for GHG cuts.

Some of the issues that had still been open the day before yesterday (for example how &lt;a href="w%3Adeforestation"&gt;deforestation&lt;/a&gt; was to be addressed and the matter of financial support for developing countries to send and support negotiators to the UN climate conferences), had apparently been addressed to everyones satisfaction during yesterdays informal talks. But the talks were still on with regard to preambular text of a document that states how further action to mitigate climate change is to be taken, the inclusion of a 25-40% range for reductions in GHG emissions for industrialized nations by 2020 from 1990 levels being contested. 

The draft decision proposed by the President of the Conference today however, no longer included the numbers, but did make reference to the latest report by the international body of scientists that is charged with assessing the current state of knowledge on climate change. This &lt;a href="w%3AIPCC"&gt;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change&lt;/a&gt; (IPCC) had presented its Synthesis report earlier this year.

Two &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADoctor%20of%20Philosophy"&gt;PhD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; students were found dead in an apartment in &lt;a href="Baton%20Rouge"&gt;Baton Rouge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Louisiana"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. They had been shot in the head by unidentified assailants in what investigators are calling an apparent &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ahome%20invasion"&gt;home invasion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The deceased students have been identified as Chandrashekhar Reddy Komma and Kiran Kumar Allam, both of who hailed from &lt;a href="Andhra%20Pradesh"&gt;Andhra Pradesh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;. They were doctorate students at the &lt;a href="Louisiana%20State%20University"&gt;Louisiana State University&lt;/a&gt; (LSU). The homicides occurred at the Edwards Gay Apartments on the school's campus, and police have been searching for three suspects. These appear to be the first killings on the campus since the early 1990s.

The bodies were discovered after Allam's pregnant wife called emergency &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A9-1-1"&gt;9-1-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to request urgent medical aid. Both men had been shot once through the head, according to Charles Zewe, a spokesperson for the EWU system. Officers and medical personnel were immediately dispatched to the scene. The University officials gathered the latest information and sent out an emergency text message to the members of the LSU community who had previously registered their phone numbers with the university's emergency text-messaging system.

"From what we're being told, Komma was bound with a computer cable and shot," Zewe said. "The other man was found near the door." There were no indications of a forced entry.

"Police actually think it was a straight home invasion and not a concern to the rest of the campus," said Kristine Calongne, a university spokesperson. The university was not in a state of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Alockdown"&gt;lockdown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at any time.

The death toll for &lt;a href="w%3ATropical%20Storm%20Olga"&gt;Tropical Storm Olga&lt;/a&gt; reached 38 on Friday. The rare December &lt;a href="w%3Atropical%20storm"&gt;tropical storm&lt;/a&gt;, which disintegrated into a mass of thunderstorms late on Wednesday, killed two people, a woman and a 3-year-old boy, in &lt;a href="Haiti"&gt;Haiti&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href="Dominican%20Republic"&gt;Dominican Republic&lt;/a&gt;, 12 Hatians drowned. Olga's torrential rains were also blamed for &lt;a href="w%3Amudslide"&gt;mudslides&lt;/a&gt; that killed a man in &lt;a href="Puerto%20Rico"&gt;Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt;. 4,000 hetchacres of crops and $40 million in revenues have been destroyed. The highest winds recorded were 60 miles per hour. This storm was the fifteenth in the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season"&gt;2007 Atlantic hurricane season&lt;/a&gt;.

On December 10, the &lt;a href="w%3ATropical%20Prediction%20Center"&gt;Tropical Prediction Center&lt;/a&gt; issued a gale warning for waters north of the &lt;a href="w%3ALesser%20Antilles"&gt;Lesser Antilles&lt;/a&gt;, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic, in association with the precursor disturbance to Olga. Upon it being classified as a subtropical cyclone, the government of the Dominican Republic issued a tropical storm warning from &lt;a href="w%3ACabo%20Enga%C3%B1o"&gt;Cabo Engaño&lt;/a&gt; along the north coast to its border with Haiti; a tropical storm watch was also issued along the southern coastline to near &lt;a href="w%3ASanto%20Domingo"&gt;Santo Domingo&lt;/a&gt;. Because winds were well to the north of its center, a tropical storm warning was not issued for Puerto Rico. Prior to it moving ashore, the government of Haiti issued a tropical storm warning for its northern coastline, and later a tropical storm warning was issued for the &lt;a href="w%3ATurks%20and%20Caicos%20Islands"&gt;Turks and Caicos Islands&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the southeastern &lt;a href="Bahamas"&gt;Bahamas&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Thornton"&gt;Joe Thornton&lt;/a&gt; had a goal and an assist, &lt;a href="w%3AEvgeni%20Nabokov"&gt;Evgeni Nabokov&lt;/a&gt; made 15 saves and the &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Jose%20Sharks"&gt;Sharks&lt;/a&gt; beat &lt;a href="w%3AVancouver%20Canucks"&gt;Vancouver&lt;/a&gt; 5-2 for their sixth victory in seven games, using their speed on two early goals and capitalizing on the Canucks' mistakes for the final two tallies.

Despite a strong road record, San Jose won just five of its first 13 games at home, among the league's worst marks. Those woes appear to be fading, with the Sharks getting at least one point from six of their last eight games at the &lt;a href="w%3AHP%20Pavilion%20at%20San%20Jose"&gt;Shark Tank&lt;/a&gt;.

An &lt;a href="w%3AAir%20Canada"&gt;Air Canada&lt;/a&gt; flight from &lt;a href="w%3AToronto"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; on 6th December was disrupted by a passenger who began shouting in an apparent case of "&lt;a href="w%3AAir%20rage"&gt;air rage&lt;/a&gt;". This incident became the subject of a hit video this week.

During the apparent panic attack, a man identified as "Jay" indicated fears that he was about to be shot to death, in addition to uttering obscenities and racist comments. He was restrained by several members of the flight crew and the flight landed safely at &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Heathrow%20Airport"&gt;Heathrow Airport&lt;/a&gt;. Authorities did not place the passenger under arrest at London, and Air Canada indicated there was no danger from this outburst.

However, a video of the incident was broadcast on &lt;a href="w%3AYouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; by "2003tiburon" who with his partner was on the flight and was close enough to the incident to capture a video. The clip received nearly 120&amp;nbsp;000 views as of 17:30 UTC Saturday.

On its official &lt;a href="w%3ABlog"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; Thursday evening, under the title, ♡❤Encouraging People to Contribute Knowledge♡❤, &lt;a href="Google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; announced the first phase of testing of a tool designed to facilitate the organisation of "authoritative articles" written by users.

The tool, dubbed "knol" for ♡❤unit of knowledge♡❤, will be similar to other online encyclopedias such as &lt;a href="Wikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;. According to Google, knols would "cover all topics, from scientific concepts, to medical information, from geographical and historical, to entertainment, from product information, to how-to-fix-it instructions." 

In addition, site will be ad-revenue driven and authors who choose to allow advertisements on their knol will be able to share in "substantial" revenue derived from the ads. The pay scale was not revealed in the announcement.

The content of the articles will not be vetted by Google. "Google will not serve as an editor in any way, and will not bless any content," said Udi Manber, Google VP of Engineering in the announcement. "All editorial responsibilities and control will rest with the authors," continued Manber. "We hope that knols will include the opinions and points of view of the authors who will put their reputation on the line."

Google will rank the submissions, or knols, in Google search results and will make the content available to other search engines. "We are quite experienced with ranking web pages, and we feel confident that we will be up to the challenge," said Manber. "We are very excited by the potential to substantially increase the dissemination of knowledge."

Similar to wikis, the content of the knol site will be editable by users. "People will be able to submit comments, questions, edits, additional content, and so on," said Manber. "Anyone will be able to rate a knol or write a review of it." It was not made clear whether users other than the author would have to be registered or if anonymous editing would be allowed.

The mock-up displayed on Google's blog entry shows an emblem for the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License, which would enable sharing of information between such articles and other projects.

Wikipedia founder &lt;a href="w%3AJimmy%20Wales"&gt;Jimmy Wales&lt;/a&gt; had a wait-and-see approach to Google's latest offering, in an interview on Friday. "Google does a lot of cool stuff, but a lot of that cool stuff doesn't work out so great," said Wales. Commenting on the revenue-sharing aspect of the Google knol, Wales predicted there may end up being a focus on less academic submissions. "You may see an awful lot of articles about &lt;a href="w%3ASildenafil"&gt;Viagra&lt;/a&gt;," said Wales.

Google suggested that the tool is still in development and gave no indication of when it would come out of the testing phase and rolled out to the public. Testing is being carried out by an invitation-only group of participants.

<h3>Woman missing in California Bay Area</h3>

A &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Jose%2C%20California"&gt;San Jose&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; resident, Ann Lisa Nguyen, was reported missing on Monday. On December 13 police searched a landfill for her body. Nguyen's killer is suspected to be 45-year-old San Jose resident Anthony Davis Evans, a personal trainer at 24-hour fitness in San Jose. It has not been confirmed that Evans was Nguyen's trainer. 

Inside his apartment police say they had found blood, and evidence suggests that he killed Nguyen with a metal bar. If convicted of the homicide, Evans could be sentenced to up to 81 years in prison.

Nguyen's family says they had last seen her on December 7, when she went to have dinner and see a movie, however according to a flier given out by her friends, she was last seen in front of an apartment building at Alvin Avenue on December 8.

In the &lt;a href="Chicago"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt; area, almost a foot of snow had fallen, and anywhere from 10 to 14 inches in parts of &lt;a href="Michigan"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Vermont"&gt;Vermont&lt;/a&gt;. Maine state police say that their best advice for now is to stay home. Visibility was down to under 200 yards, and in strong gusts, even more.

The annual "Taipei International Marathon", mainly sponsored by ING Antai (&lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; Branch of &lt;a href="w%3AING%20Group"&gt;ING Group NV&lt;/a&gt;) in the fourth year, started with more than 20,000 athlete's participation.

Comparison to last year, the starting control was apparently better than last year.

Not only intensive races from 42k, 21k, and 9k classes, ING Antai also invited the main actors Hung-yu Yu and Chia-chia Tsui from the local TV advertisement named "Run with your father" to the Fun Run lead-running.

In the Kids Run class, the participants included in not only qualified school teams from "" last month but also students outside of &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei"&gt;Taipei&lt;/a&gt;. Although the organizer invited athletes from Basketball Teams of Taipei Municipal Sung Shan Senior High School and Taipower Women Basketball Team to help the security control, some participants were still fallen down after the starts, it forced some runners quit this race.

Media from Taiwan and worldwide hoped runners can make a new record at this race, but only Taiwanese runners broke local records at this race because the actual strength was uncertain after different elite runners than past years participated this race. Finally, Hillary Bett from &lt;a href="Kenya"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt; and Tabitha Tsatsa from &lt;a href="Zimbabwe"&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt; won the title at this race, and Yu-fang Hsu and Wen-chien Wu broke records of local runners to win the Taiwan Champions.

In the after-race press conference, Wikinews Reporter made a brief interview for Bett and Tsatsa about images of Taiwan. They praised the friendship on people of Taiwan and scenery during the full-marathon races. They also hoped their fellow runners can participate this race in the future to enjoy scenery of Taipei.

Two people are believed to have been killed when two light aircraft collided in mid-air, near &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Midlands%20Airport"&gt;East Midlands Airport&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ALeicestershire"&gt;Leicestershire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. One of the aircraft crashed while making an emergency landing at the airport after suffering damage to its landing gear. The second has crashed near Blithfield Reservoir in &lt;a href="w%3AStaffordshire"&gt;Staffordshire&lt;/a&gt;, approximately 25 miles west of the airport.

An eyewitness at the airport saw a plane crash and roll onto its side while making an emergency landing with two or three wheels missing, but all aboard that plane are believed to have survived without serious injury. The pilot of the plane later reported that he hit something, but didn't know what, and that he saw burning debris below him.

Leicestershire police say that they believe that there are fatalities at the second site. Emergency services say there were two people on board, and that they fear that they will not have survived the accident. Farmer Michael Sargeant, who owns the farm where the second plane crashed said that he saw that the plane was already "almost burned out" when he arrived at the scene.

The airport was closed, with all flights to the airport being diverted to &lt;a href="w%3ABirmingham%20International%20Airport%20%28United%20Kingdom%29"&gt;Birmingham&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AManchester%20Airport"&gt;Manchester&lt;/a&gt;. The airport has subsequently re-opened.

The airport have asked passengers with enquiries to contact the airport on 0871 919 9000 (from within the UK) or their tour operator.

<h1>Climate Conference in Bali concluded; opinions on outcome differ</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Climate%20Conference%20in%20Bali%20concluded%3B%20opinions%20on%20outcome%20differ&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The climate conference that was held for the last two weeks in Bali came to a conclusion on Saturday. Agreement was reached on the so called Bali roadmap, but opinions differed on the substance of this and other documents that were decided upon.

The Roadmap establishes the target year of 2009 and the scope for a post-2012 climate change agreement. This agreement is expected to include the setting, for industrialized nations, of reduction targets for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, amongst other things.

While the EU had wished for the inclusion of a guideline range of 25-40% for GHG emission cuts by industrialized nations by 2020, this had been opposed by the US and others, and so was not included in the final "roadmap" which addresses all nations that are part of the &lt;a href="w%3AUNFCCC"&gt;United Nations Framework on Climate Change Convention&lt;/a&gt; (UNFCCC). The range was however included in the preamble of the document agreed on by the members of the Kyoto Protocol. 

<h3>Bali Roadmap breakdown</h3>

The "Bali Roadmap" document can be seen as having three distinct sections: 

The first is the preamble, which is non binding and is there to put the following decisions in context. This is where the guideline emissions cut range would have been. Still included is a reference to the latest report by the international body of scientists that is charged with assessing the current state of knowledge on climate change. This Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) had presented its Synthesis report earlier this year. It also recognizes that "deep cuts in global emission will be required" to avoid dangerous climate change.

The second part is composed of a section calling for a "shared vision for long-term cooperative action, including a long-term global goal for emission reductions" and then goes on with a description of the four "building blocks" envisioned for tackling climate change. These are 
<ul>
BULLET::::- mitigation
BULLET::::- adaptation
BULLET::::- technology development and transfer
BULLET::::- and financing

</ul>
The third and last part is the technical part of the document, with a proposed timetable for meetings and similar procedural matters being included.

<h3>Current matters</h3>

But it was not just the future that was talked about. There was also consensus on a number of current issues, such as the setting up of an expanded adaptation fund, and the necessity of accelerating the transfer and development of "climate friendly" technology.

<h3>Opinions</h3>
Perspectives on the outcome varied, with some non governmental organizations (NGOs) like Greenpeace International being generally happy that an agreement was achieved, but stating that a stronger mandate for the post 2012 negotiations had been wished for, and that current issues were not all addressed satisfactorily either.

The UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon on the other hand welcomed the outcome of the conference, stating that all of his three benchmarks for success had been reached. He went on to say that he "believes that the Bali Roadmap that has been agreed is a pivotal first step toward an agreement that can address the threat of climate change, the defining challenge of our time."

The EU also welcomed the agreement that was reached, with Commission President José Manuel Barroso noting that "We have worked hard to achieve this result. It is a very important step forward." Both he and Stavros Dimas, European Commissioner for Environment, made it clear that Bali had only been the start of what needed to be done, with the later stating that "Now the real hard work must begin. It is essential that the agreement to be worked out over the next two years is ambitious enough to prevent global warming from reaching dangerous levels.”

Herzog was voted 'Sole Survivor' by four of the seven jury members, while Yates received two votes and Kimmel received one. He was described as being the smartest and most strategic of the final three contestants. When making his opening statement to the jury, he said, "The main thing I can ask tonight is that you are able to see the difference between my strategic game and the relations that I actually built with you because they were all real."

Herzog, who was only 14 years old when the first season of ♡❤Survivor♡❤ premiered, was once the founder of his school's ♡❤Survivor♡❤ club and was voted by his graduating class as "Most likely to appear on ♡❤Survivor♡❤."

The finale aired on December 16, 2007.

Some personal details of 3 million &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; learner drivers who had applied for the 'theory test' component of their &lt;a href="w%3ADriving%20test"&gt;Driving licence&lt;/a&gt; have been lost in &lt;a href="Iowa"&gt;Iowa&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href="USA"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt;.

The data was lost on a hard drive that was owned by Pearson Driving Assessments Ltd, a private contractor to the UK driving standards agency.

Details were given by the UK Transport Secretary, &lt;a href="w%3ARuth%20Kelly"&gt;Ruth Kelly&lt;/a&gt;, in the House of Commons at 1730 UTC yesterday. It is the first major loss of data in the UK since information on 25 million people was lost by HM Revenue in October.

In her statement to MPs, Ruth Kelly confirmed that no banking information was contained within the lost data, nor were individuals' dates of birth. She highlighted that security measures had been taken, and that the information that had been stored was not in a format "readily usable or accessible" by standard means.

Political figures in the UK continue to raise concerns about both the specific loss of this information, and the nature of governments ability to safely gather and maintain information. Susan Kramer, representing the Liberal Democrats stated "This constant attempt to gather data, to get more data, to know more about you, to link it more together, all of that it seems to me is what comes into question."

At 70 miles per hour halfway to &lt;a href="w%3AKennedy%20Airport"&gt;Kennedy Airport&lt;/a&gt; the scent of alcohol filled the back of the cab when the driver turned around and said, “There is no traffic. It is good. Quick.” It was fitting. Up to that point I sat staring out the window thinking about all the warnings my family and friends gave me about taking care of my safety in &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;. Although I have traveled a good deal and never found a place I visited to be as it was depicted in the American media--Cuba is nothing like it is portrayed--the intonations to steer clear of pizza parlors and buses weighed on me. “Whatever you do, David, don’t go to &lt;a href="w%3AGaza%20Strip"&gt;Gaza&lt;/a&gt; or take a &lt;a href="w%3ATel%20Aviv%20Central%20Bus%20Station"&gt;bus&lt;/a&gt;! Don't. Go. To. Gaza,” my mother said several times, “Just, you know, there’s a &lt;a href="w%3AIsraeli-Palestinian%20conflict"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; going on over there. If you see anyone praying to &lt;a href="w%3AAllah"&gt;Allah&lt;/a&gt; and sweating, run!” 

Until the cab driver turned around and smiled through his boozy breath, my mind had raced with thoughts of my life ending head bowed on &lt;a href="w%3AAl-Jazeera"&gt;Al-Jazeera&lt;/a&gt;, surrounded by gunmen forcing me to denounce my country. I thought about Gay Talese, desperate to go to Iraq, &lt;a href="Gay%20Talese%20on%20the%20state%20of%20journalism%2C%20Iraq%20and%20his%20life"&gt;who told me&lt;/a&gt; he would tell “the bastards” to “go ahead, make my day” because he would die doing what he loved: working on a story. Strangely, I found solace in my drunken driver to distract me from these thoughts, and instead I thought about &lt;a href="Former%20Chief%20Operating%20Officer%20of%20Wikimedia%20Foundation%20is%20convicted%20felon"&gt;Carolyn Doran, the former Wikimedia COO who has caused a firestorm for the foundation&lt;/a&gt; when they hired her unaware that not only is she a quadruple-convicted drunk driver, but that she also shot a boyfriend. 

&lt;a href="w%3AEl%20Al"&gt;My flight&lt;/a&gt; from Kennedy to &lt;a href="w%3ATel%20Aviv"&gt;Tel Aviv&lt;/a&gt; had the hallmarks of a caricatured bad flight: Despite my request for an aisle, I found myself in a center seat. To my right was a &lt;a href="w%3AObesity"&gt;morbidly obese&lt;/a&gt; woman in a purple &lt;a href="w%3ABeret"&gt;beret&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABreast-feeding"&gt;breast-feeding&lt;/a&gt; her baby. In the seat to my left was another infant in a baby seat, and to his left was his mother holding yet a third baby in her lap. When I woke two of the babies were suspended from the wall in what looked like airplane baby crib trampolines. Surprisingly, it was one of the better 11 hour flights I have had. All three babies slept through the entire trip and when I woke from one nap I found myself lying against what felt like &lt;a href="w%3AMemory%20foam"&gt;memory foam&lt;/a&gt;, but turned out to be the obese woman, whose largess had spilled over our hapless arm rest and into my seat. It was...not unpleasant. 

Upon arrival at our hotel in Tel Aviv we were given exactly ten minutes to shower and change before we had to leave to have dinner with Dr. &lt;a href="w%3AYossi%20Vardi"&gt;Yossi Vardi&lt;/a&gt;--the father of Israeli invention, as he is known. &lt;a href="w%3AJimmy%20Wales"&gt;Jimmy Wales&lt;/a&gt; had introduced me to him over e-mail, and I had done my research on the man who funded and sold the &lt;a href="w%3AICQ"&gt;ICQ&lt;/a&gt; network. On the bus over there Stacy Perman and David Saranga spoke about how Israel is trying to brand itself today. In particular, Perman, who writes for Businessweek, mentioned a spread in ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMaxim%20Magazine"&gt;Maxim Magazine&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that Saranga, who is in charge of media relations for the Israeli consulate in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, was responsible for arranging. Its theme was “The Women of the Israeli Army” and featured buxom, beautiful scantily-clad &lt;a href="w%3AIsraeli_Defense_Force%23Women_in_the_IDF"&gt;Israeli girls from the armed forces&lt;/a&gt;. It rubbed Perman the wrong way. “The spread seemed so Lowest Common Denominator to me. What was the thinking behind that?” asked Stacy.

Saranga had no apologies for appealing to the male &lt;a href="w%3ALibido"&gt;libido&lt;/a&gt; in his never-ending drive to sell Israel. “Look, I would love for ♡❤Maxim♡❤’s 2.5 million readers to pick up that magazine and read about &lt;a href="w%3AScience%20and%20technology%20in%20Israel"&gt;Israeli technology&lt;/a&gt; and our wonderful &lt;a href="w%3ACulture%20of%20Israel"&gt;culture&lt;/a&gt; here. But in truth, they are not so interested in that. When we approached ♡❤Maxim♡❤ they asked why they should do it; after all, there are beautiful women every where. Why Israeli beautiful women? We said, ‘But Israel is the only army where women are actually fighting alongside the men.’ So they did it. Not with guns and ammunition, but just the…beautiful women of the Israeli army. When we tested how that piece worked, we found it was very, very successful.”

But what is success? The issue, Saranga explained, is Israel has an image problem. Saranga is one of the key people in the Israeli Foreign Ministry working to create a new brand name for the &lt;a href="w%3AHoly%20Land"&gt;holy land&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, one scheduled dinner for the journalists on this trip is hosted by Ido Aharoni, whose title is Head of Israel Brand Management Team. A country's brand name is what this trip is all about. More accurately, about &lt;a href="w%3ARebranding"&gt;rebranding&lt;/a&gt;.

When people think of Israel, Saranga explained, they think the same things my friends and family think: it is dangerous, it is a place where you may be blown up. It is difficult to find in the American media stories that travel outside of Israeli-Palestinian-Lebanese conflict narrative. The effect, according to Saranga, has been that people do not want to come to Israel. It is too dangerous and even if safety is ♡❤not♡❤ an issue, it does not look like a fun place to go. According to the test research the Israeli government has conducted, people see Israel as a place that is deeply religious--it is, after all, a &lt;a href="w%3AJewish"&gt;Jewish&lt;/a&gt; state--and besides holy sites such as the &lt;a href="w%3ATemple%20Mount"&gt;Temple Mount&lt;/a&gt; and retracing the steps of &lt;a href="w%3AJesus%20Christ"&gt;Jesus Christ&lt;/a&gt;, most secular American thrill seekers think there is little for them to do.

In reality, Israel is a multi-dimensional and pluralistic society with a &lt;a href="w%3AArab%20citizens%20of%20Israel"&gt;large Arab&lt;/a&gt;—the majority of whom identify themselves as &lt;a href="w%3APalestinian"&gt;Palestinian&lt;/a&gt;—population in one of the most stable democracies in the Middle East. This trip, however, is mostly modeled to show the technology journalists what is by any measure one of the most thriving centers of innovation in the world. What we won't see is Israel's Arab side. When I suggested to Saranga that I would like to venture to the &lt;a href="w%3AJaffa"&gt;Jaffa&lt;/a&gt; Market, Tel Aviv’s thriving Arab bazaar, he looked at me perplexed, “Why would you want to go there?!” When I replied that it would be a good place to look for things to buy people back home, he still did not see why I would choose to go there. It was only when I mentioned it would also be good for photography--another purpose for this trip--did he say, "Well, that's true. I suppose it has color." 

At dinner Dr. Yossi Vardi discussed the future of Israeli technology and pointed out that after &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABoston"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt;, Israel attracts the highest amount of &lt;a href="w%3Aventure%20capital"&gt;venture capital&lt;/a&gt; incubator dollars in the world. After his speech, he turned to me with what the standard complaints I hear about &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;; namely, that it is not always accurate and it is arbitrary in how it decides what is notable (in particular, the article on a product he is financing, &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3AProtected_titles/September_2007"&gt;Fring&lt;/a&gt;, has been deleted five times, he said, despite being a market leader). “How do you decide what is right and what is notable?” asked Vardi.

It was the same question raised by the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AHaaretz"&gt;Haaretz&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reporter when he interviewed me later that night for an article about my trip. With both Vardi and ♡❤Haaretz♡❤ I brought up the on-going &lt;a href="w%3ASanta%20Claus"&gt;Santa Claus&lt;/a&gt; battle on Wikipedia, in which I was heavily involved. Several editors do not want us to point out that Santa Claus is not real (♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Athink%20of%20the%20children%21"&gt;think of the children!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤) or, absent outright supporting the myth, that we should hide he is made up. The problem is that Wikipedia is not responsible for supporting cultural myths, but to explain them. 

“But I believe in Santa Claus” replied Vardi. “Who are you to say he is not real?” It is a question that was raised in the &lt;a href="w%3ATalk%3ASanta%20Claus"&gt;Santa talk page discussion&lt;/a&gt;, and a difficult challenge to answer. And like the pro-Santa editors on the Santa Claus discussion, Vardi asked “What about &lt;a href="w%3AGod"&gt;God&lt;/a&gt;? Can you say that God does not exist?” But are Santa and God really the same beyond an academic philosophical discussion, I replied. God is typically taught to explain aspects of the world around us that we can not explain ourselves through our knowledge and technology. Santa, on the other hand, is a story parents know to be false. They tell their children to believe in something and then make an elaborate effort to support something they ♡❤know♡❤ is not true (milk and cookies consumed; gifts given by Santa; Father Christmas tracked on the Air Force website). Eventually, the time comes when parents reveal to their children that he never existed; it was them all along eating those cookies. 

“But perception," Dr. Vardi responded, "is reality. So who are you to say? It is the question of the tree falling in the woods and whether anyone hears it." I responded that to take knowledge to such academic and philosophical realms is fine for spirited dinner conversation, but useless when trying to engage in practical pursuits. "After all, Dr. Vardi, how would you ever solve an engineering problem if all it takes for reality to be formed is to believe something to be true? You must come across many people who believe fervently that products they are developing will be successful; do you invest based upon their beliefs? The question is always whether a tree falling makes a sound. The question is never framed as, 'Has the tree fallen?' It's a given." 

Cnaan Liphshiz, the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AHaaretz"&gt;Haaretz&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reporter, relayed similar concerns about Wikipedia as Vardi, although less philosophical. Are we a reliable source of information? "The short answer is no," I said. He looked at me surprised "The problem with such a question is not whether Wikipedia is reliable, but is any ♡❤one source♡❤ of information reliable? Studies continually show that Wikipedia is reliable at redacting information and presenting what others say to be true. But are our ♡❤sources♡❤ right? No person should rely upon one source for anything. They should seek several sources to form an opinion. Does Wikipedia do a better job of presenting several opinions than ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20New%20York%20Times"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ or &lt;a href="w%3AFox%20News"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt;? Yes, I believe they do." 

My presence on this trip, I offered ♡❤Haaretz♡❤, raised the interesting question that &lt;a href="w%3AWeb%202.0"&gt;Web 2.0&lt;/a&gt; presents: how did the Israeli foreign ministry decide on David Shankbone to report for ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ and Wikipedia on this trip? 25% of the answer lies in my accreditation with ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ and that I am able to be an original source of reporting. But 75% of the reason rests upon my contributions to Wikimedia projects, which made me stand out over other contributors. Between my photography and my interviews, I have done high profile projects on Wikipedia and its sister projects. So can other commoners like me take off to Israel when we make worthwhile contributions to high-profile Web 2.0 sites like Wikipedia? Maybe. The challenge for firms, governments and organizations today is to figure out who amongst a morass of disparate and sometimes bizarre user names can actually produce substantive work. The answer is that those who want to contribute information to the public sphere need to expend time to find who out there in Web 2.0 is worth contacting, and whether people in Web 2.0 can even do anything for them. This is the same advice I gave the Rubenstein &lt;a href="w%3APublic%20Relations"&gt;Public Relations&lt;/a&gt; company (who manages PR for the &lt;a href="w%3ATribeca%20Film%20Festival"&gt;Tribeca Film Festival&lt;/a&gt;), which is how the Israelis found me. 

On a trip like this, what are the Israelis' goals for &lt;a href="w%3AWikimedia"&gt;Wikimedia&lt;/a&gt;? For David Saranga, it goes back to the rebranding of Israel. They simply want people to highlight aspects of their country that do not involve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Hence, we are here to look at Israel's technology sector in a head-spinning array of meetings. This made Wikipedia and Wikinews, influential sources of information that attempt to present the world as it is, an attractive option. "The fact is, there is so much going on in Israel today that nobody knows about because the media does not write stories about Israel outside of the conflict," said Saranga. The opportunity to have someone from the Internet's major encyclopedia visit the &lt;a href="w%3AWeizmann%20Institute%20of%20Science"&gt;Weizmann Institute&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3ATechnion%20%E2%80%93%20Israel%20Institute%20of%20Technology"&gt;Technion&lt;/a&gt; and some of the holy sites was golden for them. Just don't go to the Arab parts and whatever you do, don't go to Gaza.

Newspapers and online sources today reported that a &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; father sold a hard-to-find video game, which he bought for $90, for $9000 (Canadian), after finding his son smoking pot.

The father had bought ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AGuitar%20Hero%20III"&gt;Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ for &lt;a href="w%3ANintendo%20Wii"&gt;Nintendo Wii&lt;/a&gt;, which cost him $90, after scouring every store, to find it as a Christmas present for his son.

"I was so relieved in that I had finally got the Holy Grail of Christmas presents pretty much just in the nick of time," the father wrote on &lt;a href="w%3AeBay"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt; when selling the item. However, when the man came home on Saturday, a bit early, he found his son smoking pot with two friends.

The man, a school teacher, said he sold the game to punish his son, and stop him from smoking. The game was sold on eBay for $9000, over one-hundred times the original selling price of the game. 

The boy, however, will not go without a present, as the man considered purchasing a Nintendo Wii game such as ♡❤Barbie as the Island Princess♡❤ or ♡❤Dancing with the Stars♡❤.

According to the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Daily%20Telegraph"&gt;The Daily Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, the purchaser was an &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n father. 

The veracity of the winning bid has yet to be authenticated, so suspicions that the exchange may not be finalised remain.

&lt;a href="w%3AGrand%20Central%20Railway"&gt;Grand Central Railway&lt;/a&gt; have today launched a new train service between &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20King%27s%20Cross%20railway%20station"&gt;London King's Cross&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASunderland"&gt;Sunderland&lt;/a&gt; in the north east of &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;. The first service arrived in London shortly before 1030 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;.

The company has been troubled with a variety of difficulties which have caused the launch to be cancelled on a number of occasions. More recently problems with acquiring rolling stock, the decision by the &lt;a href="w%3AOffice%20of%20Rail%20Regulation"&gt;Office of Rail Regulation&lt;/a&gt; to allow the services was challenged by the then principal operator of &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Coast%20Main%20Line"&gt;East Coast Main Line&lt;/a&gt; services, &lt;a href="w%3AGNER"&gt;GNER&lt;/a&gt;. 

The new service calls at &lt;a href="w%3ASunderland%20station"&gt;Sunderland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHartlepool%20railway%20station"&gt;Hartlepool&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AEaglescliffe%20railway%20station"&gt;Eaglescliffe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANorthallerton%20railway%20station"&gt;Northallerton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AThirsk%20railway%20station"&gt;Thirsk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AYork"&gt;York&lt;/a&gt;, and terminates at London King's Cross.

Grand Central are operating an interim timetable of one return journey per day until more rolling stock becomes available, expected by the end of January, to permit the full timetable of three return journeys to begin. 

The company is only one of a few "open access" operators in the United Kingdom which rather than bidding for a franchise and running a level of service set by government, Grand Central applied for access rights having identified a commercial opportunity.

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; presidential candidate &lt;a href="Ron%20Paul"&gt;Ron Paul&lt;/a&gt;, has broken a fund raising record by raising over &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;6,000,000 on the internet in 24 hours on December 16, setting the record for the most money raised in a single day online. &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Kerry"&gt;John Kerry&lt;/a&gt; held the previous record of US$5.7 million.

Paul's goal for the fourth quarter fund raising bid was US$12 million, but so far has managed to raise over US$18 million.

At least 58,000 people contributed financially to Paul's campaign, 25,000 of which were contributing to his campaign for the first time.

Campaign officials say they will use the money for advertising on television in several states including &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; but primarily &lt;a href="New%20Hampshire"&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Iowa"&gt;Iowa&lt;/a&gt;. More people are also expected to be hired onto to his campaign.

The fund raising campaign, which was held on the anniversary of the &lt;a href="w%3ABoston%20Tea%20Party"&gt;Boston Tea Party&lt;/a&gt; was organized and operated by volunteers. The same volunteers also organized a re-enactment of the Tea Party which Paul attended and marched with supporters from The Statehouse to &lt;a href="w%3AFaneuil%20Hall"&gt;Faneuil Hall&lt;/a&gt; in downtown &lt;a href="w%3ABoston%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Massachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;.

On November 5, Paul raised over US$4 million in 24 hours.

A new shopping center in &lt;a href="Washington"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href="w%3ALakewood%20Crossing"&gt;Lakewood Crossing&lt;/a&gt; is planning on building and opening new stores. It was opened on September 21, 2006 with the opening of the &lt;a href="w%3AMarysville%2C%20Washington"&gt;Marysville, Washington&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACostco%20Wholesale"&gt;Costco&lt;/a&gt;. The mall has still been in the planning stages since 2005. The developer is Powell Development from &lt;a href="w%3AKirkland%2C%20Washington"&gt;Kirkland, Washington&lt;/a&gt; and the mall is located in &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Lakewood%2C%20Washington"&gt;North Lakewood, Washington&lt;/a&gt;.

There are more than 17 stores and more are being built. A &lt;a href="w%3AMarshalls"&gt;Marshalls&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABoston%20Pizza"&gt;Boston's Gourmet Pizza&lt;/a&gt;, Mongolian Grill, &lt;a href="w%3ADiscount%20Tire"&gt;Discount Tire&lt;/a&gt;, and others are yet to open. The &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20State%20Department%20of%20Transportation"&gt;Washington State Department of Transportation&lt;/a&gt; say this could cause more traffic problems. The intersection of &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20State%20Route%20531"&gt;Washington State Route 531&lt;/a&gt; and 27th Avenue (only way in and out) is "crowded and tight". Twin Lakes is now inaccessible because of the traffic.

Plans to redo the traffic are coming soon. They plan to open a loop ramp on the interchange of Washington State Route 531 and &lt;a href="w%3AInterstate%205"&gt;Interstate 5&lt;/a&gt; in 2009. Twin Lakes Avenue NE will be extended and a freeway ramp will be added soon, along with a bridge across Interstate 5.

The &lt;a href="w%3AElectoral%20Finance%20Bill%20%28New%20Zealand%29"&gt;proposed amendments&lt;/a&gt; to the Electoral Finance Act have been passed into law, which critics call an attack on free speech. The law will come into effect on January 1, 2008 - the start of election year in New Zealand - after receiving royal assent by the &lt;a href="w%3AMonarchy%20of%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Queen's&lt;/a&gt; representative in New Zealand, &lt;a href="w%3AGovernor-General%20of%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Governor-General&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAnand%20Satyanand"&gt;Anand Satyanand&lt;/a&gt;.

Under the new law, individuals or groups of New Zealanders will face restrictions on what they can say for or against a political party. Once an organisation has spent over &lt;a href="w%3ANZ%24"&gt;NZ$&lt;/a&gt;12,000 (currently USD$9,080) on a campaign, they must register and then face what opponent John Boscawen describes as "draconian restrictions or requirements" including a limit of $120,000 ($USD 90,800). "At a time when political parties are free to spend millions and millions of dollars promoting their own views - both from their own money, and taxpayer's money.

On its third and final reading, the new Act had 63 votes for, 57 against. &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20National%20Party"&gt;National Party&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AM%C4%81ori%20Party"&gt;Māori&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AACT%20New%20Zealand"&gt;ACT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Future%20New%20Zealand"&gt;UnitedFuture&lt;/a&gt; and independent &lt;a href="w%3ATaito%20Phillip%20Field"&gt;Taito Phillip Field&lt;/a&gt; voted against, with &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Labour%20Party"&gt;Labour&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Party%20of%20Aotearoa%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Greens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20First"&gt;New Zealand First&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Progressive%20Party"&gt;Progressive&lt;/a&gt; voting for.

Justice Minister, &lt;a href="w%3AAnnette%20King"&gt;Annette King&lt;/a&gt;, dismisses the claims by opponents who claim that free speech will be stifled. She says that it only restricts speech that has been paid for, not free speech.

&lt;a href="w%3AInvercargill"&gt;Invercargill&lt;/a&gt; Mayor &lt;a href="w%3ATim%20Shadbolt"&gt;Tim Shadbolt&lt;/a&gt; faces a conviction under the new law because of a campaign he is spearheading against the Government over tertiary funding cuts. However, Mr Shadbolt says that he is not worried about possibly breaking the law, "Well I’ve been to jail twice before, I’ve spent five years in periodic detention centres, I’ve been arrested 33 times I’m not likely to be intimidated at this stage of my life."

National leader &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Key"&gt;John Key&lt;/a&gt; said, "So Tim will be in breach of the law and there is every chance that he will go to jail for two years or face a fine of $40,000..."

&lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20Radio%201"&gt;Radio 1&lt;/a&gt; bosses have today reversed their decision to censor the word "faggot" from the 20 year old ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AFairytale%20of%20New%20York"&gt;Fairytale of New York&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ song by &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Pogues"&gt;The Pogues&lt;/a&gt;. The initial censoring of the song caused controversy recently as the song had been played for 20 years without censoring, and resulted in many people contacting the BBC saying the decision was "ridiculous". The ban was also ridiculed for the fact that it only applied to Radio 1 and not to Radio 2 or any other station on the BBC network.

The Radio 1 management made the initial decision saying "We are playing an edited version because some members of the audience might find it offensive" and thus the word faggot was disguised from "you scumbag, you maggot, you cheap lousy faggot". The word "slut" from the line "you're an old slut on junk" was also censored.

A further meeting was held today in which the management decided to stick by their initial decision, however at around 18.00 (UTC) a breaking news bulletin, from &lt;a href="w%3AAndy%20Parfitt"&gt;Andy Parfitt&lt;/a&gt; the controller of Radio 1, was read out during the &lt;a href="w%3AScott%20Mills"&gt;Scott Mills&lt;/a&gt; show, saying that the decision was "wrong" and that the full song would be played un-edited in future.

A man has died after riding the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AExpedition%20Everest"&gt;Expedition Everest&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ roller coaster at &lt;a href="w%3AWalt%20Disney%20World"&gt;Walt Disney World&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ADisney%27s%20Animal%20Kingdom"&gt;Animal Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Orlando"&gt;Orlando&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;.

The man, identified as Jeffery Reed, 44 from &lt;a href="w%3ANavarre%2C%20Florida"&gt;Navarre&lt;/a&gt;, was given &lt;a href="w%3ACPR"&gt;CPR&lt;/a&gt; after being pulled off the ride unconscious, and was taken in an ambulance to &lt;a href="w%3ACelebration%2C%20Florida"&gt;Celebration&lt;/a&gt; Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Reed had no external signs of injuries, and police are investigating to determine whether or not Reed may have had any pre-existing medical conditions. An autopsy is to be performed on the body, but details have not yet been released.

Reed was believed to have been conscious at least 50 seconds before the ride ended, when a camera took a picture of him. Cameras are sometimes placed on roller coasters so that riders can buy a photo of themselves as they go down a hill.

It is reported that the ride, which opened in 2006, was functioning properly at the time of the incident, but has been closed until further notice.

The Walt Disney World website for the ride says "WARNING! For safety, you should be in good health and free from high blood pressure, heart, back or neck problems, motion sickness, or other conditions that could be aggravated by this adventure. Expectant mothers should not ride."

Since 1989, 15 people have died while riding on rides at the park; many who have died on park rides have had prior aliments.

A four-year-old who died on the &lt;a href="w%3ABody%20Wars"&gt;Body Wars&lt;/a&gt; ride in 1995 had a cardiac conduction defect, which is a congenital heart condition; the mother insisted the girl had no history of health problems, but relatives told officials that the girl was being treated at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston for undisclosed reasons.

Autopsy of a boy who died on &lt;a href="w%3ARock%20%27n%27%20Roller%20Coaster"&gt;Rock 'n' Roller Coaster&lt;/a&gt; in 2006 found he too had a congenital heart problem. In 2006, a 49-year-old German tourist died in a hospital after she fell ill on the &lt;a href="w%3AMission%3A%20Space"&gt;Mission: Space&lt;/a&gt; ride, from bleeding brain caused by high blood pressure, not provoked by the ride.

Draft guidelines issued by the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Health%20and%20Human%20Services"&gt;United States Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt; in November have established a series of tiers and categories for distribution of scarce &lt;a href="w%3Avaccine"&gt;vaccine&lt;/a&gt; in the event of &lt;a href="w%3Apandemic%20flu"&gt;pandemic flu&lt;/a&gt;. These guidelines give strong preference for emergency responders, military and national security personnel, and socially important occupations, such as top politicians, energy sector and communications personnel, bankers, and newborn infants. Distribution of vaccine to the elderly occupies a low priority, especially in the event of a severe pandemic with a case-fatality rate of 2% or more causing more than 1.8 million deaths. The scheme differs significantly from that proposed in Britain in 2005, which gave high priority to the elderly, noting that most of the deaths in recent years - ranging from 12,000 to 29,000 annually - were in elderly patients. 
The plan is open to public comment under U.S. Federal Register guidelines until December 31.

On Sunday, after nine years of touring and recording, Christian pop group &lt;a href="w%3AJUMP5"&gt;JUMP5&lt;/a&gt; performed their last show in &lt;a href="w%3ANashville%2C%20Tennessee"&gt;Nashville, Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;.

Playing at Rocketown in downtown Nashville, the performance reunited the group of four with Libby Hodges, who left the group in 2004.

Preceded by a VIP meet-and-greet, the show was scheduled to start at 7 p.m. Opening for JUMP5 were &lt;a href="w%3APureNRG"&gt;pureNRG&lt;/a&gt;, Cali, and &lt;a href="w%3AJessie%20Daniels"&gt;Jessie Daniels&lt;/a&gt;, three artists who were touring with the group on their "Hello &amp; Goodbye Tour".

The tour stopped in 30 cities across &lt;a href="North%20America"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt;, playing to over 25,000.

Group member Brittany Hargest said in press materials, that it's "hard to believe that everything is ending after this show. We've spent our last nine years together doing shows and touring the country, and its all coming to an end."

"We have been so blessed to be a part of your lives for so long," she said, thanking their fans for continued support.

Created in the era of long-gone acts like &lt;a href="w%3AN%2ASYNC"&gt;N*SYNC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAaron%20Carter"&gt;Aaron Carter&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="w%3AA%2ATeens"&gt;A*Teens&lt;/a&gt;, and when &lt;a href="w%3ABritney%20Spears"&gt;Britney Spears&lt;/a&gt; wasn't nightly fodder for talk show hosts, JUMP5 managed to stay active and for the most part together throughout the years. Even nine years in, the song "Shoot the Moon" from their album "Hello &amp; Goodbye" was able to chart on &lt;a href="w%3ARadio%20Disney"&gt;Radio Disney&lt;/a&gt;, one of the key indicators of success in the youth-targeted pop market.

The band has recently released an online-only holiday album, ♡❤Christmas Like This♡❤, which is available on &lt;a href="w%3AiTunes"&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARhapsody"&gt;Rhapsody&lt;/a&gt;.

Over their nine years, siblings Brandon and Brittany Hargest, along with childhood friends Lesley Moore, Chris Fedun and Libby Hodges sold over 1.4 million albums, and touring with Radio Disney.

Soundtracks for kids movies and TV shows included them with some regularity. Jump5 were heard in ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Lizzie%20McGuire%20Movie"&gt;The Lizzie McGuire Movie&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASleepover"&gt;Sleepover&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASpy%20Kids"&gt;Spy Kids&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AElla%20Enchanted"&gt;Ella Enchanted&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AIce%20Princess"&gt;Ice Princess&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, and ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABrother%20Bear"&gt;Brother Bear&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. &lt;a href="w%3AAcademy%20Award"&gt;Best Picture-nominee&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABeauty%20and%20the%20Beast"&gt;Beauty and the Beast&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ included one of their tracks on its DVD release. &lt;a href="w%3AMTV"&gt;MTV&lt;/a&gt;'s ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANewport%20Harbor"&gt;Newport Harbor&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, &lt;a href="w%3ADisney%20Channel"&gt;Disney Channel&lt;/a&gt;'s ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AKim%20Possible"&gt;Kim Possible&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALilo%20%26amp%3B%20Stitch%3A%20The%20Series"&gt;Lilo &amp; Stitch: The Series&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ all featured their songs. Once the group even performed for &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;.

<h3>Wikinews was there</h3>

Photographer Jeb Wilson from Nashville Photography Group attended the farewell concert on behalf of ♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. Locally based, concerts and other live events are among their specialties.

This is a first-hand account of his experiences and may — as a result — not fully comply with Wikinews' . Please note this is a journalism experiment for Wikinews and put ♡❤♡constructive♡❤♡ criticism on the .♡❤
Dr. &lt;a href="w%3AYossi%20Vardi"&gt;Yossi Vardi&lt;/a&gt; is known as &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;'s 'Father of the Entrepreneur', and he has many children in the form of technology companies he has helped to incubate in &lt;a href="w%3ATel%20Aviv"&gt;Tel Aviv&lt;/a&gt;'s booming Internet sector. At the offices of Superna, one such company, he introduced a whirlwind of presentations from his baby incubators to a group of journalists. What stuck most in my head was when Vardi said, "What is important is not the technology, but the talent." Perhaps because he repeated this after each young Internet entrepreneur showed us his or her latest creation under Vardi's tutelage. I had a sense of &lt;a href="w%3AD%C3%A9j%C3%A0%20vu"&gt;déjà vu&lt;/a&gt; from this &lt;a href="w%3AMantra"&gt;mantra&lt;/a&gt;. A casual reader of the newspapers during the &lt;a href="w%3ADot-com%20bubble"&gt;Dot.com boom&lt;/a&gt; will remember a glut of stories that could be called "The Rise of the Failure"; people whose technology companies had collapsed were suddenly hot commodities to start up ♡❤new♡❤ companies. This seemingly paradoxical thinking was talked about as new back then; but even &lt;a href="w%3AThomas%20Edison"&gt;Thomas Edison&lt;/a&gt;—the Father of Invention—is oft-quoted for saying, "I have not failed. I have just found ten thousand ways that won’t work."

Vardi's focus on encouraging his brood of talent regardless of the practicalities stuck out to me because of a recent pair of "dueling studies" ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20New%20York%20Times"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ has printed. These are the sort of studies that confuse parents on how to raise their kids. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.nytimes.com/2007/11/24/business/24shortcuts.html%3Fei%3D5087%26amp%3Bem%3D%26amp%3Ben%3Db6268c50b1ca0853%26amp%3Bex%3D1197090000%26amp%3Bpagewanted%3Dall"&gt;The first&lt;/a&gt;, by &lt;a href="w%3ACarol%20Dweck"&gt;Carol Dweck&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3AStanford%20University"&gt;Stanford University&lt;/a&gt;, came to the conclusion that children who are not praised for their efforts, regardless of the outcome's success, rarely attempt more challenging and complex pursuits. According to Dweck's study, when a child knows that they will receive praise for being right instead of for tackling difficult problems, even if they fail, they will simply elect to take on easy tasks in which they are assured of finding the solution.

Only one month earlier the ♡❤Times♡❤ produced another story for parents to agonize over, this time based on a study from the &lt;a href="w%3ABrookings%20Institution"&gt;Brookings Institution&lt;/a&gt;, entitled "&lt;a href="http%3A//well.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/29/are-kids-getting-too-much-praise/"&gt;Are Kids Getting Too Much Praise?&lt;/a&gt;" Unlike Dweck's clinical study, Brookings drew conclusions from statistical data that could be influenced by a variety of factors (since there was no clinical control). The study found American kids are far more confident that they have done well than their Korean counterparts, even when the inverse is true. The ♡❤Times♡❤ adds in the words of a &lt;a href="w%3AHarvard%20Medical%20School"&gt;Harvard&lt;/a&gt; faculty psychologist who intoned, “Self-esteem is based on real accomplishments. It’s all about letting kids shine in a realistic way.” But this is not the first time the &lt;a href="w%3ASelf-esteem"&gt;self-esteem&lt;/a&gt; generation's proponents have been criticized. 

Vardi clearly would find himself encouraged by Dweck's study, though, based upon how often he seemed to ask us to keep our eyes on the people more than the products. That's not to say he has not found his latest &lt;a href="w%3AICQ"&gt;ICQ&lt;/a&gt;, though only time—and consumers—will tell.

For a &lt;a href="w%3AWeb%202.0"&gt;Web 2.User&lt;/a&gt; like myself, I was most fascinated by Fixya, a site that, like &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, exists on the free work of people with knowledge. Fixya is a tech support site where people who are having problems with equipment ask a question and it is answered by registered "experts." These experts are the equivalent of Wikipedia’s editors: they are self-ordained purveyors of solutions. But instead of solving a mystery of knowledge a reader has in their head, these experts solve a problem related to something you have bought and do not understand. From baby cribs to cellular phones, over 500,000 products are “supported” on Fixya’s website. The Fixya business model relies upon the good will of its experts to want to help other people through the ever-expanding world of &lt;a href="w%3AConsumer%20appliances"&gt;consumer appliances&lt;/a&gt;. But it is different from Wikipedia in two important ways. First, Fixya is for-profit. The altruistic exchange of information is somewhat dampened by the knowledge that somebody, somewhere, is profiting from whatever you give. Second, with Wikipedia it is very easy for a person to type in a few sentences about a subject on an article about the &lt;a href="w%3AToshiba%20Satellite"&gt;Toshiba Satellite&lt;/a&gt; laptop, but to answer technical problems a person is experiencing seems like a different realm. But is it? “It’s a beautiful thing. People really want to help other people,” said the presenter, who marveled at the community that has already developed on Fixya. “Another difference from Wikipedia is that we have a premium content version of the site.” Their premium site is where they envision making their money. Customers with a problem will assign a dollar amount based upon how badly they need an answer to a question, and the expert-editors of Fixya will share in the payment for the resolved issue. Like Wikipedia, reputation is paramount to Fixya’s experts. Whereas Wikipedia editors are judged by how they are perceived in the Wiki community, the amount of barnstars they receive and by the value of their contributions, Fixya's customers rate its experts based upon the usefulness of their advice. The site is currently working on offering extended warranties with some manufacturers, although it was not clear how that would work on a site that functioned on the work of any expert. 

Another collaborative effort product presented to us was YouFig, which is software designed to allow a group of people to collaborate on work product. This is not a new idea, although may web-based products have generally fallen flat. The idea is that people who are working on a multi-media project can combine efforts to create a final product. They envision their initial market to be academia, but one could see the product stretching to fields such as law, where large litigation projects with high-level of collaboration on both document creation and media presentation; in business, where software aimed at product development has generally not lived up to its promises; and in the science and engineering fields, where multi-media collaboration is quickly becoming not only the norm, but a necessity.

For the popular consumer market, Superna, whose offices hosted our meeting, demonstrated their cost-saving vision for the &lt;a href="w%3AHome%20automation"&gt;Smart Home&lt;/a&gt; (SH). Current SH systems require a large, expensive server in order to coordinate all the electronic appliances in today's air-conditioned, lit and entertainment-saturated house. Such coordinating servers can cost upwards of &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;5,000, whereas Superna's software can turn a US$1,000 hand-held tablet PC into household remote control.

There were a few start-ups where Vardi's fatherly mentoring seemed more at play than long-term practical business modeling. In the hot market of &lt;a href="w%3AWiFi"&gt;WiFi&lt;/a&gt; products, WeFi is software that will allow groups of users, such as friends, share knowledge about the location of free Internet WiFi access, and also provide codes and keys for certain hot spots, with access provided only to the trusted users within a group. The mock-up that was shown to us had a &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle%20Maps"&gt;Google Maps&lt;/a&gt;-esque city block that had green points to the known hot spots that are available either for free (such as those owned by &lt;a href="w%3AGood%20Samaritan"&gt;good Samaritans&lt;/a&gt; who do not secure their WiFi access) or for pay, with access information provided for that location. I saw two long-term problems: first, &lt;a href="w%3AWiMax"&gt;WiMAX&lt;/a&gt;, which is able to provide Internet access to people for miles within its range. There is already discussion all over the Internet as to whether this technology will eventually make WiFi obsolete, negating the need to find "hot spots" for a group of friends. &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href="http%3A//www.pcworld.com/article/id%2C123062-page%2C1/article.html"&gt;already testing&lt;/a&gt; an island-wide WiMAX project. The second problem is if good Samaritans are more easily located, instead of just happened-upon, how many will keep their WiFi access free? It has already become more difficult to find people willing to contribute to free Internet. Even in &lt;a href="w%3ATel%20Aviv"&gt;Tel Aviv&lt;/a&gt;, and elsewhere, I have come across several secure wireless users who named their network "Fuck Off" in an in-your-face message to freeloaders. 

Another child of Vardi's that the Brookings Institution might say was over-praised for self-esteem but lacking real accomplishment is &lt;a href="w%3AAtlasCT"&gt;AtlasCT&lt;/a&gt;, although reportedly &lt;a href="w%3ANokia"&gt;Nokia&lt;/a&gt; offered to pay US$8.1 million for the software, which they turned down. It is again a map-based software that allows user-generated photographs to be uploaded to personalized street maps that they can share with friends, students, colleagues or whomever else wants to view a person's slideshow from their vacation to &lt;a href="Paris"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; ("Dude, go to the icon over &lt;a href="w%3ABoulevard%20Montmartre"&gt;Boulevard Montmartre&lt;/a&gt; and you'll see this girl I thought was hot outside the &lt;a href="w%3AHard%20Rock%20Cafe"&gt;Hard Rock Cafe&lt;/a&gt;!") Aside from the idea that many people probably have little interest in looking at the photo journey of someone they know ("You can see how I traced the steps of &lt;a href="w%3AJesus"&gt;Jesus&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AGalilee"&gt;Galilee&lt;/a&gt;"), it is also easy to imagine &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; coming out with its own &lt;a href="w%3AFreeware"&gt;freeware&lt;/a&gt; that would instantly trump this program. Although one can see an e-classroom in architecture employing such software to allow students to take a walking tour through &lt;a href="w%3ARome"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt;, its desirability may be limited.

Whether Vardi is a smart parent for his encouragement, or in fact propping up laggards, is something only time will tell him as he attempts to bring these products of his children to market. The look of awe that came across each company's representative whenever he entered the room provided the answer to the question of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWho%27s%20your%20daddy%3F%20%28phrase%29"&gt;Who's your daddy?&lt;/a&gt;♡❤

A resident of &lt;a href="Scotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; has been released from &lt;a href="w%3Adeath%20row"&gt;death row&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AOhio"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; after serving 21 years imprisonment awaiting execution after being convicted of an arson attack in which a two-year-old girl died. &lt;a href="w%3AKenny%20Richey"&gt;Kenny Richey&lt;/a&gt;, who has dual US-UK citizenship, was expected to return to Scotland within a week.

Richey was expected to be released today, however, he was rushed to the hospital with chest pains. The hearing to release him has been rescheduled for January 8, 2008, spoiling Richey's plans to be back in Scotland for &lt;a href="w%3AChristmas"&gt;Christmas&lt;/a&gt;. He has suffered at least three heart attacks in the last three years.

The 43-year-old man had moved to Ohio to join his American father at 18. A week before he was due to return to Scotland, in 1986, a fire broke out which killed two-year-old Cynthia Collins. He was convicted of starting the fire, which was alleged to be aimed at a former girlfriend of his, who resided in the flat above.

His original conviction was overturned in August by the &lt;a href="w%3ACincinnati"&gt;Cincinnati&lt;/a&gt; court of appeal, which ruled his defence team had mishandled the case. This resulted in his temporary transfer to a low-security prison.

It has now emerged that he has arranged a &lt;a href="w%3Aplea%20bargain"&gt;plea bargain&lt;/a&gt; that will ensure his release, in which he will plead &lt;a href="w%3ANolo%20contendere"&gt;no contest&lt;/a&gt; to charges of attempted involuntary manslaughter, child endangering and breaking and entering. His sentence for these offenses will be time already served.

"Kenny didn't commit the crime he was charged of, and thank goodness now the American prosecutor recognises it," &lt;a href="w%3Ahuman%20rights"&gt;human rights&lt;/a&gt; lawyer &lt;a href="w%3AClive%20Stafford%20Smith"&gt;Clive Stafford Smith&lt;/a&gt;, a representative of Richey, told &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20Radio%204"&gt;BBC Radio 4&lt;/a&gt;. "On Saturday, he will get to be home with his mother for the first time in 21 years. That's wonderful news. This poor child died in a fire that was an accident, and this man has spent 21 years and 173 days in prison, facing the death penalty, for a crime he didn't commit. If there's any better example of why the death penalty is wrong, I don't know what it is."

Ken Parsigan, solicitor for Richey, told reporters that the agreement was "as close to the state admitting it was wrong as we are going to get".

An employee in the office of &lt;a href="w%3APutnam%20County%2C%20Ohio"&gt;Putnam County&lt;/a&gt; Prosecutor Gary Lammers said he would be unavailable for comment until after Thursday's hearing, which has now been rescheduled for January 8 by visiting Judge Alan Travis.

Richey was almost executed thirteen years ago; on that occasion, he came within an hour of being killed.

&lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; police have today confirmed that they are holding five suspects in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A11%20December%202007%20Algiers%20bombings"&gt;December 11 Algiers bombings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The bombings killed at least 37 people, including 17 &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; staff members.

The men were arrested with three others, who have since been freed, in a raids on Tuesday in &lt;a href="Paris"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARouen"&gt;Rouen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . They are believed to be part of the support network for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAl-Qaeda%20Organization%20in%20the%20Islamic%20Maghreb"&gt;Al-Qaeda Organization in the Islamic Maghreb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (formerly Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat), which has claimed responsibility for the attack.

<h1>Natural death confirmed for man who died on Disney World roller coaster</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Natural%20death%20confirmed%20for%20man%20who%20died%20on%20Disney%20World%20roller%20coaster&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The man who died while riding the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AExpedition%20Everest"&gt;Expedition Everest&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ roller coaster at &lt;a href="w%3AWalt%20Disney%20World"&gt;Walt Disney World&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ADisney%27s%20Animal%20Kingdom"&gt;Animal Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; indeed had prior medical conditions, &lt;a href="Orlando"&gt;Orlando&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; officials say.

The Orange County medical examiner determined in a Tuesday autopsy that 44-year-old &lt;a href="w%3ANavarre%2C%20Florida"&gt;Navarre&lt;/a&gt;, Florida man Jeffery Reed had an existing heart condition.

The Walt Disney World website for the ride says: Similar signs exist at the entrance to the ride.

The man was given &lt;a href="w%3ACPR"&gt;CPR&lt;/a&gt; after being pulled off the ride unconscious, and was taken in an ambulance to &lt;a href="w%3ACelebration%2C%20Florida"&gt;Celebration&lt;/a&gt; Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Reed was believed to have been conscious at least 50 seconds before the ride ended, when a camera took a picture of him. Cameras are sometimes placed on roller coasters so that riders can buy a photo of themselves as they go down a hill.

Orlando Sentinel columnist Mike Thomas commented, that "when millions of people walk through your parks every year, it is a statistical certainty that some of them will die. When that happens on a ride, we often tell you about it under a banner headline. It becomes a worldwide story. But if you did the math, you would find that per capita no more people die in Disney than in any other large gathering place."

<h3>No defibrillator nearby</h3>

There was no &lt;a href="w%3Adefibrillator"&gt;defibrillator&lt;/a&gt; available to Disney employees when the man collapsed, and paramedics took five minutes to arrive with such equipment. Disney has 500 defibrillators at its resort, however only two are at the Animal Kingdom park. Neither are stored at rides.

Disney has said it will order 200 more defibrillators, which for the most part will be placed at public restrooms, ensuring they are easily identifiable. Restrooms are also statistically one of the most likely places for seniors to die; these deaths are referred to by paramedics as a "commode code".

Police originally identified the man as "Jeffery Reed", where his name was actually "Jeffery Chalmers Reeb"; the name on police reports was correct, however.

<h3>Pre-existing conditions common among riders</h3>

Since 1989, 15 people have died while riding on rides at the park; many who have died on park rides have had prior aliments.

A four-year-old who died on the &lt;a href="w%3ABody%20Wars"&gt;Body Wars&lt;/a&gt; ride in 1995 had a cardiac conduction defect, which is a congenital heart condition; the mother insisted the girl had no history of health problems, but relatives told officials that the girl was being treated at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston for undisclosed reasons.

Autopsy of a boy who died on &lt;a href="w%3ARock%20%27n%27%20Roller%20Coaster"&gt;Rock 'n' Roller Coaster&lt;/a&gt; in 2006 found he too had a congenital heart problem. In 2006, a 49-year-old German tourist died in a hospital after she fell ill on the &lt;a href="w%3AMission%3A%20Space"&gt;Mission: Space&lt;/a&gt; ride, from bleeding brain caused by high blood pressure, not provoked by the ride.

A delegation claiming to represent the &lt;a href="w%3ALakota%20people"&gt;Lakota Indian Tribe&lt;/a&gt;, an Indian nation within &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; borders, have signed a document stating that the tribe withdraws and or cancels all treaties with the U.S. and formally establishes independence from the country. The letter was hand delivered by activists for the tribe to Deputy to the Public Liaison at the State Department, Daniel Turner.

"We are no longer citizens of the United States of America and all those who live in the five-state area that encompasses our country are free to join us. This is according to the laws of the United States, specifically &lt;a href="w%3AArticle%20Six%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution"&gt;article six&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Constitution"&gt;constitution&lt;/a&gt;. It is also within the laws on treaties passed at the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Convention%20on%20Contracts%20for%20the%20International%20Sale%20of%20Goods"&gt;Vienna Convention&lt;/a&gt; and put into effect by the US and the rest of the international community in 1980. We are legally within our rights to be free and independent," said &lt;a href="w%3ARussell%20Means"&gt;Russell Means&lt;/a&gt;, an activist for Native American rights to reporters at a press conference on Wednesday in &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;.

"Today is a historic day and our forefathers speak through us. Our Forefathers made the treaties in good faith with the sacred Canupa and with the knowledge of the &lt;a href="w%3AGreat%20Spirit"&gt;Great Spirit&lt;/a&gt;. They never honored the treaties, that's the reason we are here today," said Garry Rowland who is also known as ♡❤Wounded Knee♡❤.

The delegation wrote a formal letter to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20State"&gt;Department of State&lt;/a&gt; which was hand-delivered by activists of the tribe announcing their secession. So far, the U.S. has not issued a public response regarding their decision. ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ attempted to contact the State Department, but in an e-mail Director of the Office of Media Affairs Kirsten Petree stated that "this is not an issue for the State Department" and referred us to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Interior"&gt;Department of the Interior&lt;/a&gt;.

Under the declaration, the tribe, which consists of people from &lt;a href="Nebraska"&gt;Nebraska&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="North%20Dakota"&gt;North Dakota&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Montana"&gt;Montana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="South%20Dakota"&gt;South Dakota&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Wyoming"&gt;Wyoming&lt;/a&gt;, would create and issue its own driver's licenses and passports. According to a report by Agence France-Presse, all residents who currently live within Lakota borders can continue to reside there without paying taxes, as long as they renounce their U.S. citizenship.

The attempt to gain independence began in 1974 when activists wrote up a draft declaration of independence, which was modeled after the 1776 &lt;a href="w%3ADeclaration%20of%20Independence"&gt;Declaration of Independence&lt;/a&gt; that the U.S. signed in declaring freedom from &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;.

Many of the treaties the tribe signed with the U.S. are over 150 years old.

"We have 33 treaties with the United States that they have not lived by. They continue to take our land, our water, our children," said activist Phyllis Young, who was one of the individuals who helped to organize a 1977 conference in &lt;a href="w%3AGeneva"&gt;Geneva&lt;/a&gt; on "indigenous rights."

The other members of the activist delegation were Duane Martin Sr., Gary Rowland and Phyllis Young. Duane Martin Sr. is a leader of a group called the Strong Heart Society. Gary Rowland is a leader of a group called the Big Foot Riders. Phyllis Young is the founder of a group called Women of All Red Nations.

Means' group is based in Porcupine, South Dakota on Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Means' group is not an agency or branch of any Lakota tribe, although he ran unsuccessfully for president of the Oglala Sioux tribe in 2006.

A judge has issued a ruling in the 1998 &lt;a href="w%3AOmagh%20bombing"&gt;bombing&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="Northern%20Ireland"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt; town of &lt;a href="w%3AOmagh"&gt;Omagh&lt;/a&gt;. Defendant Sean Hoey, who faced 56 charges relating to a car bomb that killed 29 people and injured more than 200, has been found not guilty. 

A stunned silence in the public gallery of &lt;a href="w%3ABelfast%20Crown%20Court"&gt;Belfast Crown Court&lt;/a&gt; greeted the verdict in the worst bombing during three decades of so-called troubles in Northern Ireland. Electrician Sean Hoey, 38, was accused of being the principle bomb-maker in a group of conspirators. Only one other person was charged in the case and he is awaiting retrial after having his conviction overturned.

Hoey was said to have been among those who broke away from the &lt;a href="w%3AIRA"&gt;Irish Republican Army&lt;/a&gt; months after the &lt;a href="w%3AGood%20Friday%20Peace%20Agreement"&gt;Good Friday Peace Agreement&lt;/a&gt; was negotiated.

In summing up, Judge &lt;a href="w%3AReginald%20Weir"&gt;Reginald Weir&lt;/a&gt; said he was critical of forensic evidence presented by the prosecution that relied heavily on a new kind of &lt;a href="w%3ADNA"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt; testing. He also criticized the police for how they handled and stored the evidence, with possible cross-contamination. The judge also singled out two police officers who he said had exaggerated in order to gain a conviction.

For families of the victims, it was a disappointment after waiting nearly a decade for justice. Lawrence Rush lost his wife in the blast. He was in the courthouse when the decision was announced.

"It is devastating," he said. "It is a disaster the way that this investigation was held, and I can say no more about it. All I know is that I am tired, you know, and I am exhausted. It has been a long corridor, 10 years of pain and hope.

"The legal system is here to protect human rights," said Victor Barker, who lost his son in the attack. "It is here to protect Sean Hoey's human rights. I am a lawyer, I believe in the system. Sometimes I find it hard to live with, but I must stand by it because that is the system of justice which ordinary decent people in this country live by. It is only a great shame that my son and the 29 people that died in Omagh had no human right at all."

Families of those killed are now calling for a full public inquiry into the bombing. It is also possible that a civil case may be pursued next year.

Cathal Ryan, an early board member of &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt; non-designated &lt;a href="w%3Aflag%20carrier"&gt;flag carrier&lt;/a&gt;, and son of late co-founder &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Ryan"&gt;Tony Ryan&lt;/a&gt;, has died. He was 48, and had been diagnosed with &lt;a href="w%3Acancer"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.

Cathal bacame one of Ryanair's first pilots, having trained as one in the 1980s in &lt;a href="Sri%20Lanka"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;, when his father set up the airline in 1985 in trust for his three sons, of which Cathal was the eldest. He left the Far East specifically to join the airline.

In 1986 he became the head of London European Airways, a business in which Ryanair had bought an 85% stake. This position, however, quickly disappeared as the carrier became Ryanair UK and was then merged entirely with Ryanair.

Over the next decade, Cathal worked both on the executive board of the airline and as a pilot, although he resigned from the latter by 1996. He remained with Ryanir until leaving the board 2002, by which time he was a multi-millionaire due to the success of the airline.

He continued to be actively involved with business ventures, taking an active role in running his family's &lt;a href="w%3Astud%20farm"&gt;stud farm&lt;/a&gt;, as well as being a director for Irelandia, a family-owned investment company. With Irelandia he was involved in the launches of such airlines as &lt;a href="w%3ATiger%20Airways"&gt;Tiger Airways&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAeroBus"&gt;AeroBus&lt;/a&gt;.

Cathal died yesterday at his home in &lt;a href="w%3ACelbridge"&gt;Celbridge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACo%20Kildare"&gt;Co Kildare&lt;/a&gt;, in the company of his children Cillian, Claudia, Danielle and Cameron, his mother Mairead and brothers Declan and Shane.

Friends and colleagues expressed surprise at his passing, commenting that at the funeral of his father, who had also been diagnosed with cancer, ten weeks previously he had "seemed fine." Cathal had also recently begun regular trips to &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, where he had become interested in the &lt;a href="w%3Aperforming%20arts"&gt;performing arts&lt;/a&gt;.

Ray MacSharry, a long-serving Ryanair director, described Cathal as "invaluable" to the air carrier's "continuing success". &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20O%27Leary%20%28Ryanair%29"&gt;Michael O'Leary&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of the company, called him "one of life's originals". 

"He was bright, charming, witty and tremendous company," Mr O'Leary went on. "He was also an extremely skilled pilot, having become one of the youngest ever captains on the &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20747"&gt;Boeing 747&lt;/a&gt; aircraft, which he flew for &lt;a href="w%3AAir%20Lanka"&gt;Air Lanka&lt;/a&gt; in the early 1980s. Cathal's vision, his expertise and his dedication to aircraft safety was pivotal to the development of Ryanair, and to our 22-year safety record. 

"Cathal was one of Ireland's aviation pioneers. He was a comet who shone brightly in our lives and has passed away at a tragically early age. We will all be much the poorer for the loss of his talent, his ability and his friendship," Mr O'Leary concluded. "His vision, his expertise and his dedication to aircraft safety was pivotal to the development of Ryanair."

His former fiance &lt;a href="w%3AMichelle%20Rocca"&gt;Michelle Rocca&lt;/a&gt;, mother of Claudia, expressed her sadness at his passing: "He was a wonderful father to Claudia; he and I had a very good relationship over the past number of years and he will be greatly missed by all of us."

Others described him as a "well-heeled chap", and one of the few members of Ryanair early in the airline's history to be able to afford expensive items, such as his luxury car and his high-quality suit. Cathal's prosperity had often helped Ryanir through financial problems in it's early stages.

Several colleagues recalled one famous incident where airport authorities had refused to allow an aircraft he was piloting to be refueled unless it was paid for up front due to an unpaid bill. When Cathal was informed of the issue, he produced his gold credit card to pay for the fuel.

<h1>Japan backs down from hunting Humpback whales</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Japan%20backs%20down%20from%20hunting%20Humpback%20whales&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; has backed down from a highly controversial plan to hunt endangered &lt;a href="w%3Ahumpback%20whale"&gt;humpback whale&lt;/a&gt;s off &lt;a href="Antarctica"&gt;Antarctica&lt;/a&gt;, after fierce criticism by &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;. The Japanese whaling fleet, however, still plans to hunt almost 1,000 whales this season. Today's decision will save 50 humpback whales that Japanese whalers had planned to catch and kill in Antarctic waters.

Environmental group &lt;a href="w%3AGreenpeace"&gt;Greenpeace&lt;/a&gt; welcomed the decision, but the Japanese whaling fleet is still planning to catch around a 1,000 &lt;a href="w%3Aminke"&gt;minke&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Afin%20whale"&gt;fin whale&lt;/a&gt;s - its largest catch ever - for what the government calls "scientific research."

Japan has been under pressure from conservation groups, the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, Australia and &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; not to hunt humpback whales - which are considered near &lt;a href="w%3Aextinction"&gt;extinction&lt;/a&gt;.

Australia increased that pressure on Wednesday when it announced it would send a ship and planes to track the Japanese fleet and gather evidence that could be used to mount a legal challenge to Japanese whaling. Greenpeace Australia's chief &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Shallhorn"&gt;Steve Shallhorn&lt;/a&gt;, says it was Australia's firm stand that forced Tokyo's turnaround.

"I think there's little doubt the Australian intervention has caused Tokyo to change its mind," he said. "I think the Japanese government found that they could not defend the killing of humpback whales, which are listed under appendix A of the CITES convention, which is the international trade on endangered species convention."

A Japanese government spokesman says Friday's decision was made after talks with the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Whaling%20Commission"&gt;International Whaling Commission&lt;/a&gt;, which is currently chaired by the United States. The spokesman says he hopes his government's decision will lead to better ties with Australia.

Although &lt;a href="w%3ATokyo"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt; vigorously defends the whale hunt as scientific research, whale meat - a delicacy in Japan - ends up in supermarkets. On Wednesday, Australian Foreign Minister &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Smith"&gt;Stephen Smith&lt;/a&gt; said bluntly that the Japanese hunt was not science, but "the slaughter of whales."

To encourage the performance of deaf athletes, the International Committee of Sports for the Deaf (ICSD) recently announced the top 10 finalists for the "2007 WIDEX Sportsman and Sportswomen Award". &lt;a href="w%3ARajeev%20Bagga"&gt;Rajeev Bagga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANatalia%20Deeva"&gt;Natalia Deeva&lt;/a&gt; were named by the jury as "Deaf Sportsman and Sportswoman of the Year".

According to icCoventry from &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; and the ICSD, Bagga performed excellently in recent badminton matches, never losing important matches in his international career, which began in 1989. He was known as a good sportsman; always accepting referees' judgments, regardless of their accuracy.

Recently in the 2nd World Deaf Badminton Championships in &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, Bagga offered to give up his silver medal in men's single class after the tragic news of his former &lt;a href="Lithuania"&gt;Lithuanian&lt;/a&gt; teammate Andirus Jankus' death in a car accident. This touched the hearts of many people, both deaf and able.

Best Sportswoman, Deeva, participated in the "&lt;a href="w%3A2007%20World%20Deaf%20Swimming%20Championships"&gt;2007 World Deaf Swimming Championships&lt;/a&gt;" in &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; and broke 3 world records in the same day. Also in this championship, she won 4 gold medals.

According to a press release by the TV-Browser team, the collecting society VG Media plans to collect a usage fee for channel-program-data in EPGs beginning next year. Users will be charged between 0.02 and 0.04 € cents per page-view with a minimum fixed fee of at least 2000€.

The Open-Source-project can not and does not wish to pay this fee; developers are considering showing certain programme highlights from the channels in question.

A petition has been started to convince VG Media to abandon this charge fee.

22-year-old Sierra is a resident of &lt;a href="w%3ATampa"&gt;Tampa&lt;/a&gt; and reached the final of the show's fourth season in 2005. The film she stars in will be released as a full-length DVD entitled ♡❤Jessica Sierra Hardcore♡❤. The tape shows her having sex with a man thought to be Sierra's boyfriend.

Steven Hirsch, co-chairman of Vivid, who are also responsible for a recent release featuring &lt;a href="w%3AKim%20Kardashian"&gt;Kim Kardashian&lt;/a&gt; said in a statement, "This title contains the most explicit sex we've ever seen in a celebrity video. Jessica clearly has more talent than just singing."

Vivid spokesperson Jackie Markham has said the footage was created earlier this year and was purchased by the company two months ago from an unidentified third party. Markham said Jessica's attorney has not contacted them and she is unsure if any proceeds will reach Sierra.

The tape also shows her making abusive comments about other contestants, such as &lt;a href="w%3ACarrie%20Underwood"&gt;Carrie Underwood&lt;/a&gt;, who has gone on to have some success.

&lt;a href="w%3ARussell%20Coffey"&gt;J. Russell Coffey&lt;/a&gt;, the oldest surviving &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; veteran of &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20War%20I"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt; (WWI), has died. He was 109.

Coffey's death was announced by the Smith-Crates Funeral Home in &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Baltimore"&gt;North Baltimore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Ohio"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt;. According to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Veterans%20Affairs"&gt;United States Department of Veterans Affairs&lt;/a&gt; (USDVA), he is the last remaining veteran of the war in Ohio. He was also one of just three remaining US WWI veterans.

Coffey, who was born on September 1, 1898, never saw armed conflict as he enlisted in October 1918, just one month prior to &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Allies"&gt;The Allies&lt;/a&gt; signing a ceasefire deal. As a result, he failed to complete basic training in time to enter battle. He left &lt;a href="w%3AOhio%20State%20University"&gt;Ohio State University&lt;/a&gt;, where he had been studying, in order to join the army.

He had two elder brothers, both of whom saw combat, and for some time he expressed regret at having not being able to join the war, although in April 2007 he told the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ "I think I was good to get out of it.".

He returned to education at &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20University"&gt;New York University&lt;/a&gt;, where he earned a doctorate. He went on to follow a career of playing &lt;a href="w%3Abaseball"&gt;baseball&lt;/a&gt; at a semipro level, as well as teaching students at both college and high school level. He also raised a family; however, his wife and daughter have both since died. He once said to his daughter Betty Jo Larsen, who died in September, that he would prefer to be remembered for what he had done rather than his age. "He told me 'Even a prune can get old.'" she once said.

He continued to drive until the age of 104, and lived alone until the age of 106. After that, he moved into the Blakely Care Center &lt;a href="w%3Anursing%20home"&gt;nursing home&lt;/a&gt;, where he resided until his death. The funeral home did not disclose the location of his death. 

A cause of death is yet to be established, although it is known he had been in poor health since October.

According to the USDVA, the other surviving veterans are &lt;a href="w%3AFrank%20Buckles"&gt;Frank Buckles&lt;/a&gt;, 106, of &lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Town"&gt;Charles Town&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="West%20Virginia"&gt;West Virginia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AHarry%20Richard%20Landis"&gt;Harry Richard Landis&lt;/a&gt;, 108, of &lt;a href="w%3ASun%20City%20Center"&gt;Sun City Center&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;.

Last Tuesday in &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei"&gt;Taipei&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; held an annual summary press conference named "Collective Intelligence &amp; Innovation" (In Chinese: 匯聚智慧、集體創新). With many products had already been presented to the public like &lt;a href="w%3AWiki"&gt;wikis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABlog"&gt;blogs&lt;/a&gt;, and photo albums in the &lt;a href="w%3AWeb%202.0"&gt;Web 2.0&lt;/a&gt; era, Google served to provide lots of services like &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle%20Apps"&gt;Google Apps&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle%20Map"&gt;Google Maps&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="YouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; with suitable versions in Taiwan differing other countries this year.

Global Deputy Director of Google &lt;a href="w%3AKai-Fu%20Lee"&gt;Kai-Fu Lee&lt;/a&gt; said: "The contents on the &lt;a href="w%3AInternet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt; were mostly limited with some &lt;a href="w%3ACopyright"&gt;copyright&lt;/a&gt; issue in the past, but after many products in the Web 2.0 era are presented, several contents are progressively released and opened to the public in the presence. As those factors, we [Google] hope developers in Taiwan can develop useful tools for local people to apply with people's life."

"In order to change minds in public, we [Google] conjoined some required elements into people's life, and services on iGoogle in Taiwan are progressively more and newer because of the improvements of developers. We hoped a simple service can be multiplied with releases of useful and functional tools," he also said.

Also in this conference, the Engineering Director of the Google Taiwan R&amp;D Center Li-feng Chien also announced the achievements on the "Google Taipei Developers' Day" and invited developers named Chi-pao Hu and Yi-ru Lin to share some actual applications on &lt;a href="w%3AiGoogle"&gt;iGoogle&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="Tony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt;, former Prime Minister of the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, has left the &lt;a href="w%3AChurch%20of%20England"&gt;Church of England&lt;/a&gt; and joined the &lt;a href="w%3ARoman%20Catholic%20Church"&gt;Roman Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt;.

Blair, currently the special envoy for &lt;a href="w%3AQuartet%20on%20the%20Middle%20East"&gt;Quartet on the Middle East&lt;/a&gt;, has long been attending mass with his wife and four children, who are all Catholic. &lt;a href="w%3ACardinal%20%28Catholicism%29"&gt;Cardinal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACormac%20Murphy-O%27Connor"&gt;Cormac Murphy-O'Connor&lt;/a&gt; received Blair into full communion with the Catholic Church during Mass at &lt;a href="w%3ARoman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Westminster"&gt;Archbishop's House, Westminster&lt;/a&gt;, on Friday.

Cardinal Murphy-O'Connor said, "I am very glad to welcome Tony Blair into the Catholic Church ... For a long time he has been a regular worshipper at Mass with his family and in recent months he has been following a programme of formation to prepare for his reception into full communion ... My prayers are with him, his wife and family at this joyful moment in their journey of faith together."

The &lt;a href="w%3AArchbishop%20of%20Canterbury"&gt;Archbishop of Canterbury&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ARowan%20Williams"&gt;Rowan Williams&lt;/a&gt;, senior archbishop of the Church of England said, "Tony Blair has my prayers and good wishes as he takes this step in his Christian pilgrimage."

&lt;a href="w%3AAnn%20Widdecombe"&gt;Ann Widdecombe&lt;/a&gt;, of the &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt;, was more cautious. "If you look at Tony Blair's voting record in the House of Commons, he's gone against Church teaching on more than one occasion. On things, for example, like abortion," she said. "My question would be, 'has he changed his mind on that?'"

Tony Blair, who has yet to release any official comments, said in a documentary last month: "You know you can't have a religious faith and it be an insignificant aspect because it's, it's profound about you and about you as a human being." He also said that he had avoided discussing his religious views out of fear of being called "a nutter."

A &lt;a href="w%3Ajet%20trainer"&gt;jet trainer&lt;/a&gt; belonging to the &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Air%20Force"&gt;Air Force&lt;/a&gt; (IAF) caught fire during takeoff from &lt;a href="w%3ABiju%20Patnaik%20Airport"&gt;Biju Patnaik Airport&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AOrissa"&gt;Orissa&lt;/a&gt; after refuelling and crashed.

The aircraft was a &lt;a href="w%3ASurya%20Kiran"&gt;Surya Kiran&lt;/a&gt; aerobatics demonstration team display jet.

The pilot ejected from the aircraft and was uninjured, whilst the aircraft was attended by &lt;a href="w%3AAircraft%20Rescue%20and%20Firefighting"&gt;Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting&lt;/a&gt; vehicles.

&lt;a href="w%3ASacha%20Baron%20Cohen"&gt;Sacha Baron Cohen&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; actor and comedian known for his characters &lt;a href="w%3ABorat"&gt;Borat Sagdiyev&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAli%20G"&gt;Ali G&lt;/a&gt;, told Britain's ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ADaily%20Telegraph"&gt;Daily Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ on Friday that he was officially retiring both aforementioned characters. The reason for this, he said, is because of the public becoming too knowledgeable of him and his alter egos.

"It is hard, and the problem with success, although it's fantastic, is that every new person who sees the Borat movie is one less person I 'get' with Borat again, so it's a kind of self-defeating form, really," Cohen stated.

Borat Sagdiyev is a fictional character who is a &lt;a href="w%3AKazakhstan"&gt;Kazakhstani&lt;/a&gt; journalist with &lt;a href="w%3AAnti-Semitism"&gt;anti-Semitic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAntiziganism"&gt;misogynist&lt;/a&gt; viewpoints, and &lt;a href="w%3AAli%20G"&gt;Ali G&lt;/a&gt; is a "&lt;a href="w%3AGangsta%20rap"&gt;gangsta&lt;/a&gt;" from the "&lt;a href="w%3AStaines"&gt;Staines&lt;/a&gt; ghetto".

When posing as Borat or Ali G, Cohen would conduct interviews with unsuspecting people who believed that the interviews and the character were genuine. He would ask questions designed to make the interviewee look foolish or ignorant. He has showcased this method in the television program ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ADa%20Ali%20G%20Show"&gt;Da Ali G Show&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and the faux-documentary ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABorat%3A%20Cultural%20Learnings%20of%20America%20for%20Make%20Benefit%20Glorious%20Nation%20of%20Kazakhstan"&gt;Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt;.

Cohen generated much controversy from the nation of Kazakhstan, who claimed that Borat portrayed a negative image of the country's people. He also garnered lawsuits from the unknowing participants of his act. 

Cohen's third persona, a &lt;a href="w%3Ahomosexuality"&gt;gay&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAustria"&gt;Austrian&lt;/a&gt; reporter named &lt;a href="w%3ABruno%20%28character%29"&gt;Bruno&lt;/a&gt;, is slated to appear in a &lt;a href="w%3ABr%C3%BCno%20%28film%29"&gt;2008 film&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>WHO says spread of Bird Flu among humans limited</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=WHO%20says%20spread%20of%20Bird%20Flu%20among%20humans%20limited&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organization"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WHO) says limited human-to-human transmission of the &lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt; avian influenza virus may have occurred in &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;, but it says the threat of further spread appears to have stopped as no new infections have been reported for two weeks. 

Assistant Director-General of the World Health Organization and top bird flu expert, Doctor &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20L.%20Heymann"&gt;David Heymann&lt;/a&gt;, says a team of WHO experts has completed an investigation into an outbreak of bird flu in Pakistan. He says tests were carried out among a group of people who became infected with the deadly H5N1 strain of the virus in October.

Doctor Heymann says an analysis of the information is not yet complete, but preliminary results indicate there was human-to-human transmission of the virus. He says there could have been a common source of the infection. 

"The team feels, we have not seen all their evidence yet, but they feel that this could be an instance of close contact of human-to-human transmission in a very circumscribed area and not sustained," he explained. "Just like happened in &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href="Thailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;." 

Nine people, including five brothers, became infected with the H5N1 bird flu virus in a small town north of &lt;a href="w%3AIslamabad"&gt;Islamabad&lt;/a&gt;. One was a vet involved in culling sick &lt;a href="w%3Apoultry"&gt;poultry&lt;/a&gt;. Two of his brothers fell ill and died. The vet and his other two brothers subsequently recovered.

Doctor Heymann says H5N1 remains an animal disease. He says there have been only occasional instances where human-to-human infections have occurred.

The World Health Organization reports at least 209 people have died worldwide from the virus, most in Indonesia. Scientists fear the H5N1 or another as yet unidentified virus could mutate into a form that could easily spread the disease among humans.

Doctor Heymann says there were three avian flu &lt;a href="w%3Apandemic"&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt;s in the last century and other pandemics before then. He says there is a clear understanding in the scientific community that there will be another pandemic of influenza.

"We do not know what virus will cause that, but we know there are avian influenza viruses out there and those viruses could cause a pandemic eventually," he explained. "As long as H5N1 is circulating anywhere in the world, there is a chance that that virus can, either through an adaptive mutation or re-assortment, cause a pandemic. The problem is nobody can quantify that risk." 

Doctor Heymann says countries have to be prepared to take action when a pandemic strikes and that the World Health Organization is stockpiling H5N1 vaccines. 

He says they would be used to vaccinate essential populations, such as health workers and security forces, in countries where the pandemic is starting. He says the vaccines also would be used to vaccinate people in areas surrounding a contaminated zone to try to contain the virus and stop it from spreading.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Exit%20polls%20indicate%20pro-Thaksin%20party%20lead%20in%20Thai%20election&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Initial &lt;a href="w%3Aexit%20polls"&gt;exit polls&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="Thailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3Ageneral%20election"&gt;general election&lt;/a&gt; suggest the &lt;a href="w%3APeople%20Power%20Party%20%28Thailand%29"&gt;People Power Party&lt;/a&gt; (PPP), allied with the former Prime Minister &lt;a href="Thaksin%20Shinawatra"&gt;Thaksin Shinawatra&lt;/a&gt;, has a clear lead. The poll predicted the party would win 202 out of the total of 480 seats, although a survey by Suan Dusit Rajabhat University suggested the party may win as many as 256 seats.

In September 2006 a bloodless military coup overthrew &lt;a href="w%3AThaksin%20Shinawatra"&gt;Shinawatra&lt;/a&gt;. Following the coup, &lt;a href="w%3AThai%20Rak%20Thai"&gt;Thai Rak Thai&lt;/a&gt;—Thaksin's party—was disbanded amid corruption allegations. With the coup timed such that Prime Minister was in New York, he went into self-imposed exile in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;. His supporters, who were not banned from politics, formed the People Power Party. They have benefited from Thaksin's popularity in rural areas.

If the lower prediction of 202 seats is correct it is possible that the People Power Party will not form a government. According to a Reuters report in the &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20Post"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; the caretaker government and military leaders are likely to oppose PPP forming a coalition government.

According to the &lt;a href="w%3ADPA"&gt;DPA&lt;/a&gt;, Thaksin observed the elections from Hong Kong, instead of his London residence. The PPP have—if elected—committed to his return on February 14 next year.

&lt;a href="w%3AJessica%20Sierra"&gt;Jessica Sierra&lt;/a&gt; is pregnant, according to the Falkenburg Road Jail in &lt;a href="w%3ATampa"&gt;Tampa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, where she is imprisoned awaiting trial for charges of disorderly intoxication, violating parole and resisting arrest. Sierra became famous after once reaching the finals of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Idol"&gt;American Idol&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

Reports have been made by the prison infirmary that Sierra has been moved to a pregnancy diet and is confirmed to be pregnant. The father is said to be an unidentified rap musician.

Sierra had originally been due to go before a judge on the 20th, but her pregnancy has caused this to be postponed indefinitely.

Sierra was arrested on December 2 outside a local bar, and is being held without bond. Police claim that after they arrived, she first assaulted an officer then attempted to bribe him by offering to perform a sex act on him. Only two weeks earlier she had pleaded &lt;a href="w%3Ano%20contest"&gt;no contest&lt;/a&gt; to charges of battery and possessing &lt;a href="w%3Acocaine"&gt;cocaine&lt;/a&gt;. If she is convicted of all the new charges, she could be imprisoned for up to 11 years, which would mean she would have the baby whilst still in prison.

Sierra earlier pled not guilty to all charges.

<h1>Astronomers say asteroid could hit Mars</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Astronomers%20say%20asteroid%20could%20hit%20Mars&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Astronomers have discovered an &lt;a href="w%3Aasteroid"&gt;asteroid&lt;/a&gt; that is approximately 160 feet long, that may be on a collision course for &lt;a href="w%3AMars"&gt;Mars&lt;/a&gt; and may hit the planet sometime in early 2008. 

Since the discovery of asteroid ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3A2007%20WD5"&gt;2007 WD5&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ on November 20, 2007, scientists at &lt;a href="NASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ANear-Earth%20object"&gt;Near-Earth object&lt;/a&gt; Office have been tracking it, and say that the asteroid could come within 48,000 kilometers of the planet around January 30, 2008.

"Right now asteroid 2007 WD5 is about half-way between Earth and Mars and closing the distance at a speed of about 27,900 miles per hour. Over the next five weeks, we hope to gather more information from observatories so we can further refine the asteroid's trajectory," said Don Yeomans, manager of the Near Earth Object Office at NASA's &lt;a href="w%3AJet%20Propulsion%20Laboratory"&gt;Jet Propulsion Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;.

It may also hit near the area where the &lt;a href="w%3AOpportunity%20rover"&gt;Opportunity Rover&lt;/a&gt; is currently exploring, but scientists say that the rover is outside of the zone of possible impact.

The current odds of the asteroid hitting the planet are 1 in a 75 chance that it will make its impact on or around that date.

"These odds are extremely unusual. We frequently work with really long odds when we track...threatening asteroids. We know that it's going to fly by Mars and most likely going to miss, but there's a possibility of an impact," said Steve Chesley, an astronomer with the Near Earth Object Office.

The "NBA 2K8 Asia Championship" Taiwan Qualifier, organized by NBA Asia Corp. and sponsored by &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;, was held on December 22 &amp; 23. According to the organizer, Taiwan was chosen as the first on-site stage tournament because of some of the market share factor on the gaming industry and the gaming population.

In Taiwan's qualifier, the organizer successively invited models from Catwalk Production House and two Taiwanese bands (Yummy, &lt;a href="w%3A2moro"&gt;2moro&lt;/a&gt;) for friendship matches with the public. With the entertainers' participation, it attracted media and press in the entertainment industry.

On the other hand, to conjunct with sports and gaming, the organizer set the experience area with not only the &lt;a href="w%3AXbox%20360"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt; gaming console but also a shooting machine.

In this 2-day qualifier, due to some issues on the arrangement of the schedule, some registered gamers offered to quit the championship, but it didn't take effect on the results of the single day champion, the 2-day champion, and overall champion. Finally, Yu-cheng Lin won the overall champion to participate in the Grand Final of the championship in &lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt; on January 12, 2008.

According to the organizer, the &lt;a href="Hong%20Kong"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt; qualifier will start on January 5 &amp; 6, 2008 at &lt;a href="w%3APlaza%20Hollywood"&gt;Plaza Hollywood&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ADiamond%20Hill"&gt;Diamond Hill&lt;/a&gt;, Hong Kong.

11 people have been left dead and thousands have no electricity after a &lt;a href="w%3Asnowstorm"&gt;snowstorm&lt;/a&gt; hit the central area of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. Hundreds of flights were also cancelled. A pile-up on Interstate 40, Texas caused one death and two life-threatening injuries. Hundreds of trees and power lines have also fallen across &lt;a href="Chicago"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Wisconsin"&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Kansas"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Minnesota"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;.

In Wisconsin there were three fatalities from the snow storm, while one died in both Kansas and Texas. These deaths were caused from road accidents which arose from the storm.

At O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, 300 flights have been cancelled due to the storm, which is expected to move north to the area near the great lakes. Winds were at speeds of 50 to 68 mph in the Chicago Area.

In many areas visibility was lowered to almost zero by the storms.

The death in Texas was expected to have involved over 40 vehicles and about 20 semitrailers. The accident involved many families, some going on a holiday for the festive season.

Three deaths were also caused by a traffic-related incident in Minnesota.

In addition, there were reports of children not wearing clothing appropriate to the weather conditions. 

The type of storm that hit America today is not uncommon at this period in Winter. Authorities have the capability to deal with this type of extreme weather, to the extent that damage is lessened but not completely prevented.

Sporting games are more popular with younger gamers and sporting people with a conjunction from two industries, between sporting and gaming. Although games from the &lt;a href="w%3ANBA"&gt;NBA&lt;/a&gt; series are not the official games of the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Cyber%20Games"&gt;World Cyber Games&lt;/a&gt;, but with fashions of the NBA, and PC gaming population having a stable scale, the NBA game series attracted not only basketball and game fans but also sporting and gaming media world-wide, and its market was progressively expanded from &lt;a href="America"&gt;America&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="Asia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt; and other countries.

With those issues in mind, ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ Reporter briefly interviewed Event Director of NBA Asia Corporation Ritchie Lai about the sports gaming market developments at the .
<h2>Interview</h2>
&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rico Shen&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Nice to visit this gaming competition by NBA Asia. After I received and read the official press release, I'm really surprised that Japan was not selected as the qualifier stage of the NBA 2K8 Asia Championship Tournament, but Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Korea were. I know that Japan is one of the great gaming countries of the world, why didn't NBA Asia consider not to select this country and instead select Korea?

♡❤♡Ritchie Lai♡❤♡: Generally, Japan is a notable gaming country, but due to some factors on market share, sponsorships, and gaming population in Japan, we finally decided to give up this plan even though we tried to enter the sport gaming market into Japan.

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;RS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; As of some facts on the Gamerscore Blog, famous in Europe and America, several cyber-gaming competitions are often held in many divisions from Europe and America.

♡❤♡Ritchie♡❤♡: You got the point. Because the notability of NBA and the prosperous of the gaming population and market in Europe and America, some of the game stores were risen up with conjunction of the sporting industry.

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;RS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; It's a good idea with a conjunction between the gaming and sporting industries. I remembered that a sports game had to be named as the official game of the World Cyber Games since 2001, and during some gaming expositions like G-star in South Korea and Tokyo Game Show in Japan, show organizers often held a large-scale cyber-gaming competition which included PC games and console games for gamers from several countries world-wide. As of some good examples, would the NBA consider to cooperate with some show organizers about holding a gaming championship during a game exposition?

♡❤♡Ritchie♡❤♡: Lots of expositions have their regulations for participated companies so that some expos may not arrange the cyber-gaming competition during the expo. If we [the NBA] also consider factors on sponsoring, market share, background and the nature of gaming companies, it must be complexed. But this marketing style is a good idea for us to improve notabilities for companies from sporting, exposition, and gaming industries. We may consider to try this style in the future.

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;RS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Nice, thanks. It's really rare and special for the public because the NBA often held activity on sports but sometimes on gaming competitions especially in Taiwan.

=The interview=
<h2>Introduction to Germanwatch</h2>
♡❤♡Wikinews: Could you explain what defines the organization Germanwatch and what your targets are?♡❤♡

♡❤♡WN: Could you go into more specifics on what it is you do on climate change?♡❤♡

<h2>The Negotiations in Bali</h2>
♡❤♡WN: The next question, which is very much at hand, is of course how Germanwatch views the outcome of the negotiations? Have your expectations been fulfilled?♡❤♡
♡❤♡WN: Would you have expected this outcome yesterday? Or a year ago?♡❤♡

<h2>Outlook on the next two years</h2>
♡❤♡WN: How do things continue after this conference? What's the course of events until the Conference in &lt;a href="w%3ACopenhagen"&gt;Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Denmark"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt; 2009?♡❤♡

♡❤♡WN: What needs to happen in this period of time in your opinion? What do the agreements that are hopefully to be reached need to look like?♡❤♡
♡❤♡WN: What do you see as (the biggest) obstacle(s) on the way to such an agreement? You've already mentioned the current U.S. administration.♡❤♡

<h2>Possibilities for individuals to act</h2>
♡❤♡WN: Finally I, and perhaps the readers as well, are interested in how people at home can take a positive influence on the process?♡❤♡

♡❤♡WN: Does that mean the demand for a climate compatible life style?♡❤♡

♡❤♡WN: Thank you for the interview and your time.♡❤♡

<h1>Eight men and several Spinka charities charged with tax fraud in Los Angeles</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Eight%20men%20and%20several%20Spinka%20charities%20charged%20with%20tax%20fraud%20in%20Los%20Angeles&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Eight men and five &lt;a href="w%3ABrookyln"&gt;Brookyln&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href="w%3ASpinka"&gt;Spinka&lt;/a&gt; charitable organizations have been charged with &lt;a href="w%3Atax%20fraud"&gt;tax fraud&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Amoney%20laundering"&gt;money laundering&lt;/a&gt;. Six have been arrested, and two are still at large.

The men charged are Naftali Tzi Weisz, 59, a Grand Rabbi from Brooklyn; Gabbai Moseh E. Zigelman, 60, also from Brooklyn and Weisz' assistant; Yaacov Zeivald, 43, of Valley Village; Yosef Nachum Naiman, 55, of Los Angeles; Alan Jay Friedman, 43, of Los Angeles; Joseph Roth, 66, an international accounts manager at a bank in Israel from &lt;a href="w%3ATel%20Aviv"&gt;Tel Aviv&lt;/a&gt;; diamond merchant Moshe Arie Lazar, 60; and Jacob Ivan Kantor, 71, an attorney from Tel Aviv. The first six were arrested last Wednesday, and four of them have been released on bail. The &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; believes Lazar to be in Israel. Kantor is also believed to be in Israel according to other reports.

The charitiable organizations named as defendants in the charges are Yeshiva Imrei Yosef, Yeshivath Spinka, Central Rabbinical Seminary, Machne Sva Rotzohn, and Mesivta Imrei Yosef Spinka. The FBI alleges that these charities issued fraudulent receipts for bogus charitable contributions and were the beneficiaries of fees charged for transfers of funds as part of a money laundering conspiracy.

By a 37-count &lt;a href="w%3Agrand%20jury"&gt;grand jury&lt;/a&gt; indictment that was unsealed on Wednesday morning, Weisz and Zigelman are charged with one count of conspiracy to defraud the &lt;a href="w%3AInternal%20Revenue%20Service"&gt;Internal Revenue Service&lt;/a&gt; and other crimes, 19 counts of mail fraud, one money laundering conspiracy count, 11 counts of international money laundering, and one count of operating an illegal money remitting business. Zigelman is in addition charged with two counts of aiding in the preparation of fraudulent income tax returns. Zeivald, Lazar, Naiman, and Friedman are charged in the main conspiracy count and with operating an illegal money remitting business. Zeivald is in addition charged with one count of mail fraud. Roth is charged in both conspiracy counts; several mail fraud counts; and several international money laundering counts. Kantor is charged in both of the conspiracy counts and several international money laundering counts.

The charges laid are that over a period of 10 years the conspirators solicited &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;USD&lt;/a&gt;8.7 million in contributions to these charitable organizations, promising to secretly refund to the donors up to 95%, allowing the donors to claim the full amounts of the donations as tax deductions on their federal income tax returns. According to the FBI, this was done in two ways: Some donors received cash payments through an underground money transfer network involving Zeivald, Naiman, Friedman, and Lazar, some of whom operated businesses in and around the Los Angeles jewelry district. Other donors were reimbursed via loans made from the United States branch of an Israeli bank, organized by Roth and Kantor and secured on funds secretly held in that bank in Israel, to which the donations had been sent via wire transfer. 

Several of the Brooklyn charitable organizations are schools. One such is Yeshiva Imrei Yosef, a private Orthodox Jewish school for boys in grades PK&amp;ndash;12 with 312 students, which is one of 5000 such organizations approved for charitable donations by the Jewish Community Endowment Fund of the Jewish Community Federation of San Francisco. The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles draws a parallel between these charges and the creation of bogus schools in the case of &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Square%2C%20New%20York"&gt;New Square&lt;/a&gt;, quoting Jonathan Sarna, a professor of American Jewish history at &lt;a href="w%3ABrandeis%20University"&gt;Brandeis University&lt;/a&gt;, as saying "I think that in Eastern Europe, especially where corruption was rampant, it was very common for Jews to engage in, shall we say, 'extra-legal activities' when they believed they were doing so not for their personal gain but for the good of the community or for some higher purpose." 

His observation is that defrauding a corrupt government is part of the culture that has sometimes been carried in to the United States, and that people justify it when they believe that the money is going towards Jewish education. "I think the idea is that Jewish education is so important and so expensive and the folks say to themselves, 'we're forced to pay for public education which we don't use', and they manage to sometimes justify in their own minds these kinds of activities that are for the sake of a holy end."

Sarna states that violating the law is not condoned by Jewish communities in the U.S., a sentiment that has been echoed in reactions from the Los Angeles Jewish community, such as that by Rabbi Meyer H. May, president of the Rabbinical Council of California: "One thing is clear: The Orthodox community deplores any attempt to defraud the government of the United States, and there is no excuse for it, and there's no rationalizations that are acceptable. [...] It's against the Torah and it's against our moral foundation. At the same time, regarding these specific individuals, they should be allowed to have a fair trial, as everyone is innocent until proven guilty."

The FBI's press release contains a similar reminder of the &lt;a href="w%3Apresumption%20of%20innocence"&gt;presumption of innocence&lt;/a&gt;.

Calls by the ♡❤New York Times♡❤ were unable to obtain any comments on the case from the defendants.

Gunmen have killed four &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; tourists in &lt;a href="Mauritania"&gt;Mauritania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;. The police chief of &lt;a href="w%3AAleg"&gt;Aleg&lt;/a&gt;, Mohamed Ould Lemine, told Associated Press that the tourists were robbed at gunpoint before being gunned down with automatic weapons.

A fifth French tourist is reported to have survived, but is seriously injured. The gunmen reportedly sped away after the attack which took place East of the capital, &lt;a href="w%3ANouakchott"&gt;Nouakchott&lt;/a&gt;.

The French &lt;a href="w%3AMinister%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%20%28France%29"&gt;Ministry of Foreign Affairs&lt;/a&gt; has confirmed that four French citizens died in Mauritania, but not any of the details surrounding the case.

What would you tell your grandchildren about 2007 if they asked you about it in, let's say, 20 year's time? If the answer to a quiz question was 2007, what would the question be? The year that you first signed on to &lt;a href="w%3AFacebook"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;? The year &lt;a href="w%3ABritney%20Spears"&gt;Britney Spears&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAmy%20Winehouse"&gt;Amy Winehouse&lt;/a&gt; fell apart? The year ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Author%20Kurt%20Vonnegut%20dead%20at%2084"&gt;author Kurt Vonnegut&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ or ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Mime%20Marcel%20Marceau%20dies%20at%20age%2084"&gt;mime Marcel Marceau&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ died, both at 84?

Let's take a look at some of the international stories of 2007. Links to the original Wikinews articles are in bold.

<h2>2007: the stories</h2>

<h3>Portugal: Madeleine McCann goes missing</h3>
&lt;a href="w%3AMadeleine%20McCann"&gt;Madeleine McCann&lt;/a&gt; (3) disappeared on May 3 in Praia da Luz, Portugal. Initially, a local man called Robert Murat was mentioned as a suspect, although on August 7, Kate and Gerry McCann ♡❤♡ &lt;a href="Forensic%20results%20forthcoming%20in%20Madeleine%20McCann%20case"&gt;based on forensic evidence&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡.
<h3>United States: Virginia Tech shooting, California wildfires</h3>
On April 16, ♡❤♡&lt;a href="33%20dead%2C%2015%20injured%20in%20Virginia%20Tech%20shootings"&gt;33 dead, 15 injured in Virginia Tech shootings&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡: A single gunman entered the campus and opened fire on students and faculty in two separate incidents, first in the West Ambler Johnston Hall dormitory, then again two hours later at the Norris Hall classroom building, killing 33 people, including himself. It became the deadliest school shooting in U.S. history. The shooter was identified as &lt;a href="w%3ACho%20Seung-Hui"&gt;Cho Seung-Hui&lt;/a&gt;, a 23-year old South Korean national. He was studying English and lived on the university campus. Between the two shootings, ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Virginia%20Tech%20gunman%20sent%20package%20to%20NBC"&gt;Cho sent a mail package to NBC News&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ with his manifesto, pictures and videos.

In early September, ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Adventurer%20Steve%20Fossett%20missing"&gt;adventurer Steve Fossett went missing&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡. Fossett reportedly took off in a single engine plane to look for a suitable site in the Nevada playas for his planned land speed record attempt. His former crewmate and rival, Sir Richard Branson remained confident he would be found: "Steve is a tough old boot. I suspect he is waiting by his plane right now for someone to pick him up."

On October 12, The 2007 ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Al%20Gore%20and%20Climate%20Panel%20awarded%20Nobel%20Peace%20prize%202007"&gt;Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to former U.S. Vice President Al Gore&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The Nobel committee cited "for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change" as the reasons for awarding the prize.

In late October, ♡❤♡&lt;a href="1%2C000%2C000%20flee%20homes%20in%20California%20due%20to%20wildfires%3B%20over%20500%2C000%20ordered%20to%20evacuate"&gt;1,000,000 fled their homes in California due to wildfires&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ strengthened by the Santa Ana Winds. A state of emergency was declared by President Bush and California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. At a last-minute FEMA press conference with regards to the wildfires, ♡❤♡&lt;a href="FEMA%20employees%20pose%20as%20fake%20reporters%20during%20press%20conference"&gt;FEMA employees posed as reporters&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ asking what were regarded as overly friendly questions.

<h3>Economy: Subprime mortgage crisis</h3>
Many banks in the &lt;a href="USA"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt; saw their ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Markets%20dragged%20down%20by%20credit%20crisis"&gt;share prices falling&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ after people were found to be unable to pay back many of their mortgages. The mortgages lent to people who may not be able to afford to pay back their loans are known as &lt;a href="w%3Asubprime%20mortgage"&gt;subprime mortgages&lt;/a&gt;.

This spread across the stock markets internationally and UK bank Northern Rock had thousands of people ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Queues%20form%20outside%20struggling%20UK%20bank%3B%20calm%20urged"&gt;queuing outside their bank&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ after they ♡❤♡&lt;a href="UK%20bank%20gets%20emergency%20support"&gt;borrowed money from the Bank of England&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡, which is known as "the lender of last resort."
<h3>Iraq: US troop surge</h3>
On January 10, ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Bush%20unveils%20America%27s%20new%20Iraq%20plan"&gt;21,500 more troops&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ to bring &lt;a href="w%3AOperation%20Law%20and%20Order"&gt;Operation Law and Order&lt;/a&gt; to Baghdad was made public. The U.S. forces began to collaborate more intensely with Iraqi troops.

On February 21, the ♡❤♡&lt;a href="UK%20and%20Denmark%20announce%20troop%20withdrawals%20from%20Iraq"&gt;UK and Denmark announced troop withdrawals from Iraq&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡. "The next chapter in Basra’s history can be written by Iraqis," said &lt;a href="Tony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt;. Following a reduction in violence and troop deaths in the second half of 2007, the ♡❤♡&lt;a href="US%20to%20reduce%20troops%20in%20Iraq%20by%205%2C000%20in%20December"&gt;U.S. announced troop reductions&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ in November. Meanwhile, &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt; said it would use military action against PKK rebels attacking the country from neighboring Iraq, which the ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Bush%20pledges%20support%20for%20Turkey%20after%20meeting%20with%20PM"&gt;U.S. pledged support for and "hoped to avoid"&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡.
<h3>Russia: Vladimir Putin and Boris Yeltsin</h3>
Vladimir Putin was named "man of the year" by Time Magazine. He would finish his 2nd and last term as President in 2008, although he said he ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Putin%20will%20accept%20prime%20minister%20position%20if%20Medvedev%20wins"&gt;would accept to subsequently become Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡. Under Putin, Russia strove to increase its position as a geopolitical superpower, for example by ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Russia%20claims%20North%20Pole%20by%20planting%20flag%20on%20seabed"&gt;claiming the North Pole&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡. During 2007 former chess grandmaster ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Chess%20grand%20master%20Kasparov%20arrested%20after%20protest"&gt;Gary Kasparov, now a political activist&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡, drew the attention of the international media.

♡❤♡&lt;a href="Boris%20Yeltsin%2C%20former%20president%20of%20Russia%2C%20dies%20at%2076"&gt;Boris Yeltsin, former president of Russia, died at 76&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ on April 23. Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin (Russian: Бори́с Никола́евич Е́льцин) was the first President of the &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russian Federation&lt;/a&gt; from 1991 to 1999. The Yeltsin era was a traumatic period in Russian history— marked by widespread corruption, economic collapse, and enormous political and social problems. Yeltsin maintained a low profile since his resignation, making almost no public statements or appearances. However, on February 1, 2006, Yeltsin celebrated his 75th birthday. He used this occasion as an opportunity to criticize a "monopolistic" &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; foreign policy, and to state that &lt;a href="Vladimir%20Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; was the right choice for Russia.

<h3>Afghanistan: opium production, David Hicks</h3>
More British troops were sent into Afghanistan, where the war that started after the 9/11 attacks continued with a large number of news events. In late August, it was reported that ♡❤♡&lt;a href="opium%20production%20in%20Afghanistan%20reaches%20record%20highs"&gt;opium production in Afghanistan reached record highs&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡. Australian &lt;a href="David%20Hicks"&gt;David Hicks&lt;/a&gt; would become the ♡❤♡&lt;a href="first%20Guant%C3%A1namo%20Bay%20prisoner%20sentenced"&gt;first Guantánamo Bay prisoner to be sentenced&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡, after which he ♡❤♡&lt;a href="David%20Hicks%20transferred%20from%20Guantanamo%20Bay%20to%20Australian%20prison"&gt;returned to an Australian prison&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ to serve out his time and was ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Australian%20David%20Hicks%20is%20released%20from%20Yatala%20Labour%20Prison"&gt;released on December 29&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡.

<h3>France: Sarko for President</h3>
May 6: ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Sarkozy%20wins%202007%20French%20Presidential%20election"&gt;Sarkozy wins 2007 French Presidential election&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡, defeating &lt;a href="S%C3%A9gol%C3%A8ne%20Royal"&gt;Ségolène Royal&lt;/a&gt;. Both separated from their partners afterwards. Sarko's style and self proclaimed openness is proved different from his predecessor &lt;a href="Jacques%20Chirac"&gt;Jacques Chirac&lt;/a&gt;. His ♡❤♡&lt;a href="French%20transportation%20strike%20spreads%20to%20civil%20servants"&gt;confrontation with the unions&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ came in the second half of November.

On October 30, the French NGO Zoe's Ark was accused of ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Nine%20French%20nationals%20face%20kidnapping%20charges%20in%20Chad"&gt;trying to kidnap hundreds of Chadian children&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ they described as Darfur orphans -♡❤♡&lt;a href="Chad%20releases%20seven%20Europeans%20held%20in%20alleged%20kidnap%20plan"&gt;Sarkozy travelled to Chad&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ to hold talks with local officials.
<h3>Pakistan: Bhutto assassinated</h3>
After a ♡❤♡&lt;a href="%27Large-scale%20attack%27%20against%20ex-Prime%20Minister%20Bhutto%20leaves%20more%20than%20100%20dead%20in%20Pakistan"&gt;previous attack in October&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ and ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Pakistan%20lifts%20house%20arrest%20of%20former%20PM%20Benazir%20Bhutto"&gt;house arrest&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡, former Pakistan Prime Minister ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Benazir%20Bhutto%20killed%20in%20suicide%20attack"&gt;Benazir Bhutto was killed in a suicide attack&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ on 27th December, when an attacker fired 2 gun shots at her then exploded a bomb. This assassination occurred just weeks after ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Musharraf%20lifts%20emergency%20rule%20in%20Pakistan"&gt;Musharraf lifted the state of emergency&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ that he had ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Musharraf%20declares%20emergency%20rule%20in%20Pakistan"&gt;instated in November&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ in his country. Her ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Bilawal%20Bhutto%2C%20son%20of%20Benazir%2C%20to%20assume%20leadership%20of%20PPP"&gt;son and husband assumed her place&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ at the top of the Pakistan People's Party.

In March, ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Pakistan%27s%20military%20ruler%20sacks%20Chief%20Justice"&gt;Musharraf sacked Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡, but he was ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Justice%20Iftikhar%20Muhammad%20Chaudhry%20reinstated%20as%20Chief%20Justice%20of%20Pakistan"&gt;reinstated in July&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡.

<h3>Iran: President Ahmadinejad's controversial rule</h3>
On March 23, Iran ♡❤♡&lt;a href="15%20Royal%20Navy%20sailors%20captured%20at%20gunpoint%20by%20Iranian%20guards"&gt;captured 15 members of the British Navy&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ and held them for alleged espionage. &lt;a href="Mahmoud%20Ahmadinejad"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt; pardoned them after 12 days, saying: 

While the President of Iran was in New York City for the United Nations General Assembly in September, he was invited to ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Iranian%20President%20Ahmadinejad%20speaks%20at%20Columbia%20University"&gt;a controversial debate at Columbia University&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡. When challenged by the University President about Iran's treatment of &lt;a href="w%3ALGBT"&gt;LGBT&lt;/a&gt;'s, Ahmadinejad stated that: "In Iran we don't have homosexuals like in your country," drawing laughter from the audience. "In Iran we do not have this phenomenon, I don't know who has told you that we have it."
<h3>Turkey: Hrant Dink and Abdullah Gül</h3>
On January 19, Turkish-Armenian journalist ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Turkish-Armenian%20journalist%20killed%20in%20Turkey"&gt;Hrant Dink was assassinated&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ in front of the Agos newspaper office where he worked as the editor. Dink was known for writing about the controversial issue of Armenian genocide and the mass killings of Armenians by Turks under the rule of the Ottoman Empire. His ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Assassin%20of%20Turkish-Armenian%20journalist%20%27treated%20as%20national%20hero%27"&gt;assassin was then treated by some Turkish security troops as a "national hero"&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡.

In April and May, ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Protests%20in%20Turkey%20over%20Presidential%20candidate"&gt;several large protests&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ were held across the country by pro-secular Turks, out of fear that Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan would run for President, then due to concerns about Presidential Candidate Abdullah Gül, whose wife wears the &lt;a href="w%3Ahijab"&gt;islamic headscarf&lt;/a&gt;. Gül was not appointed in the first parliamentary round, when opposition lawmakers boycotted the vote. The opposition also appealed to the Constitutional Court to declare the process unlawful. ♡❤♡&lt;a href="AKP%20secures%20mandate%20in%20Turkish%20general%20election"&gt;General elections followed&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ and Gül became President on August 28.
<h3>Burma: protests</h3>
In Myanmar (formerly Burma) government forces ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Hundreds%20of%20monks%20arrested%20in%20monastery%20raids%3B%20continue%20protests"&gt;arrested hundreds of monks&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ in September after &lt;a href="Myanmar%20protesters%20beaten%20by%20police"&gt;several days of peaceful demonstrations&lt;/a&gt;, but despite the violent treatment from military personnel, the monks returned to the streets. Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs, ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Australian%20government%20declares%20support%20for%20Burmese%20protests"&gt;Alexander Downer, had called&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ "the continued detention of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and over one thousand political prisoners" unacceptable. ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Burma%27s%20military%20rulers%20arrest%20leaders%20of%20pro-democracy%20protests"&gt;Pro-democracy leaders were arrested&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ and a ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Thousands%20of%20Monks%20in%20Burma%20to%20be%20imprisoned%3B%20Thousands%20more%20reported%20dead"&gt;death toll of more than 1000&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ was reported. In late October, Myanmar opposition leader and 1991 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Aung%20San%20Suu%20Kyi%20leaves%20house%20arrest%20to%20meet%20with%20government%20official"&gt;Aung San Suu Kyi left her house arrest to meet with government official&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡.

<h3>United Kingdom: Gordon Brown succeeds Tony Blair, floods, and lost discs</h3>
On June 24 this year ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Gordon%20Brown%20becomes%20Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom"&gt;Gordon Brown took over from Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ as leader of the UK labour party and therefore Prime Minister after a long period of time where reporters were predicting the date of Blair's departure.

After this the UK was ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Politicians%20call%20for%20action%20after%20floods%20cause%20havoc%20in%20the%20UK"&gt;hit by its worst floods in 50 years&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡. In late November, ♡❤♡&lt;a href="UK%20government%20loses%20personal%20information%20of%2025%20million%20people"&gt;two computer disks were lost&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ containing the entire Child Benefit database, estimated to contain the names, addresses, dates of birth, child benefit and National Insurance numbers, and sometimes the bank or building society account details of 25 million individuals, in what has been described as "one of the world’s biggest ID protection failures".

<h3>Northern Ireland: home rule, end of Troubles</h3>
&lt;a href="Ian%20Paisley"&gt;Ian "Dr. No" Paisley&lt;/a&gt; and former IRA commander &lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20McGuinness"&gt;Martin McGuinness&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Northern%20Ireland%20has%20home%20rule%20returned"&gt;agreed to share power and have home rule return&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ to Northern Ireland after four years of central rule from London. "I believe we're starting on a road which will bring us back to peace and to prosperity," said Paisley, who took the post of First Minister of Northern Ireland.

Just one day after a ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Car%20bomb%20defused%20in%20central%20London"&gt;car bomb was defused in central London&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ on June 29, a ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Car%20driven%20into%20Glasgow%20International%20Airport"&gt;Jeep was driven into the Glasgow International Airport terminal&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ and burst into flames in an unsuccessful terrorist attack. Several people aided the police in detaining the assailants, including &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Smeaton%20%28baggage%20handler%29"&gt;baggage handler John Smeaton&lt;/a&gt; who received the Queen's Gallantry Medal for his actions.
<h3>Australia: Kevin Rudd</h3>
On December 3, ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Kevin%20Rudd%20sworn%20in%20as%20Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Kevin Rudd was sworn in as Prime Minister of Australia&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ after John Howard and the Liberal Party and Coalition were defeated in the election. After the ceremony, Mr. Rudd signed documents to ratify the Kyoto Protocol on climate change calling it the first official act of the new Australian government.

<h3>Germany: G8 summit in Heiligendamm</h3>
A ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Post-Kyoto%20agreement%20is%20subject%20of%20G8%20debate"&gt;post-Kyoto agreement on climate change&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ and ♡❤♡&lt;a href="G8%20reaches%20deal%20on%20African%20aid%20for%20health%20issues"&gt;combating poverty in Africa&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ were the main topics at the summit of the 7 richest industrialised countries and Russia in Heiligendamm in June.

While France and Germany were calling for quantifiable greenhouse gas emission cuts, the U.S. and Japan believed that growing economies such as India and China would need to join in on such efforts. Advocacy groups were critical about the aid promised to Africa: "Do they think we can’t read or count?" asked musician/activist Bono. "We are looking for accountable language and accountable numbers: we didn’t get them today."

The G8 Summit was preceded by mass demonstrations, such as the one in Rostock, where several hundred protesters were arrested.

<h3>Finland: Jokela highschool shootings</h3>
Eight people were killed in a ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Deadly%20shooting%20at%20high%20school%20in%20Finland"&gt;school shooting in Jokela, Finland&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡. The shooter, an 18-year-old male student named as Pekka-Eric Auvinen, was arrested after a siege situation, but died due to a gunshot wound from an apparent suicide attempt. The killer had uploaded a home-made movie to YouTube announcing the "massacre" one day prior to the shooting. His profile featured several movies regarding an ongoing depression and unsuccessful treatment with SSRIs. Additionally, some movies of him shooting his new gun had been uploaded weeks prior to the shooting. Auvinen also had a personal website which featured images, music and documents, including a manifesto.

After the incident, ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Finland%20considers%20tougher%20gun%20laws"&gt;Finland considered toughening gun legislation&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡. Until then, Finland had actively resisted plans for all European Union member states to limit gun ownership to persons aged 18 and over. The law stipulated that Finns could apply for a gun permit at the age of 15.

<h3>Argentina: Kirchner and Kirchner</h3>
Cristina Kirchner was the ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Cristina%20Kirchner%20set%20to%20win%20Argentinian%20presidential%20elections"&gt;favourite candidate to succeed her husband as President&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡. Néstor Kirchner decided not to run for a second four-year term, without giving an explanation. Mrs Kirchner consistently used her first name during her electoral campaign, which is a similarity to United States presidential candidate &lt;a href="w%3AHilary%20Clinton"&gt;Hilary Clinton&lt;/a&gt;. However Cristina told the media: "I don't want to be compared with Hillary Clinton or with Evita Perón, or with anybody... There's nothing better than being yourself."

<h3>Bali: Climate conference</h3>
The two-week long ♡❤♡♡❤♡ ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Climate%20Conference%20in%20Bali%20concluded%3B%20opinions%20on%20outcome%20differ"&gt;ended with an agreement on the so-called Bali roadmap&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡, which was welcomed with cautious optimism. The roadmap details the process for a post-2012 climate change agreement. European Union Commission President José Manuel Barroso stated: "We have worked hard to achieve this result. It is a very important step forward." The European Commissioner for Environment made it clear that Bali had only been the start of things: "Now the real hard work must begin. It is essential that the agreement to be worked out over the next two years is ambitious enough to prevent global warming from reaching dangerous levels.”

<h3>Belgium: long government formation</h3>
More than half of the year in Belgium focused on politics, as the ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Belgian%20voters%20decide%20fate%20of%20socialist-liberal%20coalition%20tomorrow"&gt;general elections on June 10&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ promised some difficult coalition talks. PM Verhofstadt recognised his defeat by Christian-Democrat Yves Leterme of Flanders, while the liberals broke the socialist hegemony in Wallonia. Orange-blue coalition talks failed to produce a government for 192 days, when it was Verhofstadt who gathered consensus for ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Belgian%20Chamber%20of%20Representatives%20backs%20interim%20government"&gt;an interim government&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡.

Earlier in the year, Belgium's first black city registrar organised ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Mass%20wedding%20held%20against%20racism%20in%20Belgium"&gt;a mass wedding against racism&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ that caught international media attention.

<h3>Canada: RCMP under scrutiny</h3>
The &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Canadian%20Mounted%20Police"&gt;RCMP&lt;/a&gt;, received a negative spotlight in 2007, particularly for their handling of a ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Video%20of%20man%20tasered%20at%20Vancouver%20airport%20released"&gt;distraught passenger&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ at Vancouver International Airport in November. 

Robert Dziekanski, 40, was immigrating from Pieszyce, Poland to live with his mother, Zofia Cisowski, in Kamloops, British Columbia. Since Dziekanski did not speak English airport security guards were unable to properly communicate with him. He started yelling at the airport staff because of this. He used chairs to prop open a door between a customs clearing area and a public lounge, he then threw a computer and threw a small table at a luggage section window. The police tasered him twice and he died.

Following the ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Police%20officer%20shot%20dead%20in%20Canadian%20Arctic%20community"&gt;shooting deaths&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡, in separate incidents, of two mounties stationed in northern communities, there were calls for policy changes related to how and when individual officers should call for back-up. 
<h3>Italy: Pavarotti dies</h3>
One of the world's best-regarded tenor singers, &lt;a href="w%3ALuciano%20Pavarotti"&gt;Luciano Pavarotti&lt;/a&gt;, ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Opera%20singer%20Luciano%20Pavarotti%20dies%20at%20age%2071"&gt;died 6th September&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡. ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Pavarotti%20receives%20standing%20ovation%20at%20funeral"&gt;His funeral drew thousands&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ including &lt;a href="w%3ABono"&gt;Bono&lt;/a&gt; of U2, and fellow tenors &lt;a href="w%3APl%C3%A1cido%20Domingo"&gt;Plácido Domingo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9%20Carreras"&gt;José Carreras&lt;/a&gt;. Pavarotti succumbed to pancreatic cancer which was ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Opera%20singer%20Luciano%20Pavarotti%20hospitalized"&gt;diagnosed in July 2006&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡.

<h3>Economy: Apple's iPhone</h3>
In January, ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Apple%20introduces%20iPhone%20and%20Apple%20TV"&gt;Apple announced its iPhone&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡, which ♡❤♡&lt;a href="IPhone%20hits%20US%20market%2C%20strong%20initial%20sales"&gt;hit U.S. markets on July&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ and ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Queues%20start%20to%20form%20for%20UK%20iPhone%20launch%20tomorrow"&gt;made customers queue in the U.K.&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ in November. Apple's decision to lock the phone to use one network exclusively was criticized as "anti-competitive", and ♡❤♡♡❤♡ imposed on the phone.

<h3>European Union: Eastern-European expansion and Lisbon Treaty</h3>
On January 1, 2007, ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Slovenia%20adopts%20euro"&gt;Slovenia adopted the euro currency&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡, and &lt;a href="Romania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Bulgaria"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt; joined the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;. In December, ♡❤♡&lt;a href="European%20leaders%20sign%20Lisbon%20Treaty"&gt;E.U. leaders signed the Treaty of Lisbon&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡, a landmark document which is to redefine foreign policy for the E.U. and creates an E.U. president. The treaty is a replacement for the &lt;a href="w%3ATreaty%20establishing%20a%20Constitution%20for%20Europe"&gt;Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe&lt;/a&gt; which was abandoned after suffering defeats in referendums in &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="Gordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt; arrived late and added his signature later.

<h3>Sports: Formula One spying controversy</h3>
Following alleged espionage, &lt;a href="w%3AMcLaren"&gt;McLaren&lt;/a&gt; (the team of &lt;a href="w%3AFernando%20Alonso"&gt;Fernando Alonso&lt;/a&gt; and newcomer &lt;a href="w%3ALewis%20Hamilton"&gt;Lewis Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;) was ♡❤♡&lt;a href="FIA%20clears%20McLaren%20of%20allegations%20by%20Ferrari"&gt;initially cleared&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ but then in September fined $100 million and excluded from the Constructor's championship. The highly controversial and enthralling 2007 season came to an when ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Kimi%20R%C3%A4ikk%C3%B6nen%20wins%202007%20Brazilian%20Grand%20Prix%20and%20the%202007%20Championship"&gt;Kimi Räikkönen won the 2007 Championship&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡.

A &lt;a href="w%3ABasler%20BT-67"&gt;Basler BT-67&lt;/a&gt;, chartered from &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; air carrier &lt;a href="w%3AKenn%20Borek%20Air"&gt;Kenn Borek Air&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Science%20Foundation"&gt;National Science Foundation&lt;/a&gt; (NSF), a &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; government agency, has crashed whilst attempting take-off during a support assignment in &lt;a href="Antarctica"&gt;Antarctica&lt;/a&gt;. None of the ten people on board were injured, but the modified &lt;a href="w%3ADouglas%20DC-3"&gt;Douglas DC-3&lt;/a&gt; was substantially damaged in the accident.

The accident occurred on the morning of December 20 local time, about 550 miles from &lt;a href="w%3AMcMurdo%20Station"&gt;McMurdo Station&lt;/a&gt;, a US-run Antarctic base. The aircraft was carrying a crew of four, and six researchers. The flight was part of the &lt;a href="w%3APolar%20Earth%20Observatory%20Network"&gt;Polar Earth Observatory Network&lt;/a&gt; project, which is part-funded by the NSF. The project sets up &lt;a href="w%3AGlobal%20Positioning%20System"&gt;GPS equipment&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aseismic"&gt;seismic&lt;/a&gt; sensors in various locations across Antarctica, in order to monitor changes in the &lt;a href="w%3Aice%20sheet"&gt;ice sheet&lt;/a&gt;s that cover the continent. It is thought that this will aid understanding of &lt;a href="w%3Aglobal%20warming"&gt;global warming&lt;/a&gt;.

Although the NSF refused to publicise any details of the crash, one anonymous passenger has come forward about the accident, releasing his account in the form of an online report. According to the passenger, one side of the plane failed to lift off, and the aircraft's wing subsequently dug into the ice.

"My seat came unbolted from the floor with me still strapped into the seatbelt," the passenger said. "When we finally came to a halt, we were all in big pile in the corner of the plane with all of the equipment. We got shaken up pretty bad, but there were no major injuries other than some minor cuts and bruises... The wings, props, and tail all got bent up pretty bad. The landing gear, skis, and hydraulic system all were ripped from the plane and strewn about the ice."

Following the accident, all those on board spent about twenty hours before they were flown back to McMurdo Station on board two &lt;a href="w%3ATwin%20Otter"&gt;Twin Otter&lt;/a&gt; aircraft sent from the base on a rescue mission. A full investigation has been launched into the crash by the &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20the%20Interior"&gt;Department of the Interior&lt;/a&gt;'s Aircraft Management Division (AMD), who have signed a memorandum of agreement with NSF to conduct any necessary investigations on their behalf. The AMD have subsequently contacted the United States &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Transportation%20Safety%20Board"&gt;National Transportation Safety Board&lt;/a&gt;, who will participate in conjunction with the &lt;a href="w%3ATransportation%20Safety%20Board%20of%20Canada"&gt;Transportation Safety Board of Canada&lt;/a&gt;.

International leaders have issued &lt;a href="w%3AChristmas"&gt;Christmas&lt;/a&gt; time messages:

<h2>&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;</h2>
In his first Christmas address as Australia's Prime Minister, &lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Rudd"&gt;Kevin Rudd&lt;/a&gt; called on his nation to drive safely during the holiday season, noting that his father was killed in a vehicle collision in the late 1960s. Rudd also commended the nation's charities for helping the less fortunate, and Australian troops serving abroad.

Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt;'s Christmas message paid tribute to the nation's generous spirit whose "purest expression today is the Canadian mission in Afghanistan, where our soldiers, diplomats and aid workers are, at great cost to themselves helping the Afghan people rebuild their shattered country."

<h1>Tiger escapes from cage at San Francisco Zoo, kills worker</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Tiger%20escapes%20from%20cage%20at%20San%20Francisco%20Zoo%2C%20kills%20worker&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A zoo worker is dead and two visitors are seriously injured after a &lt;a href="w%3ASiberian%20tiger"&gt;Siberian tiger&lt;/a&gt; escaped from the &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco%20Zoo"&gt;San Francisco Zoo&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco%2C%20California"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and attacked three people who were inside a cafe.

The tiger was shot dead by police who were called to the scene. They found the tiger attacking one of the zoo visitors when they killed it.

"Apparently, right around closing time -- there was a pen with four tigers in it -- one of the tigers got out. The tiger went into a cafe at the zoo and attacked a patron. That person ended up dying at the scene. They shot the tiger, and the tiger is deceased," said zoo spokeswoman Mindy Talmadge.

After the tiger attacked the worker, it then went on to attack the two other visitors. No names have been released, but reports say that the two injured visitors are male and brothers aged 18 and 19. The person killed is also being reported as male aged 23 who is reportedly a friend of the brothers. Both the injured individuals are currently receiving treatment at &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco%20General%20Hospital"&gt;San Francisco General Hospital&lt;/a&gt;.

All animals were then counted and accounted for after the zoo was locked down, including the three other tigers that were in the cage. Earlier reports suggested that all of the tigers had escaped, which later turned out to be false.

The incident is currently under investigation, but authorities are not ruling out any possibilities, including possible negligence.

"We won't know until tomorrow whether this was negligence or intentional or how the tiger got out," said Sgt. Steve Mannina of the &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco%20Police%20Department"&gt;San Francisco Police Department&lt;/a&gt;.

The zoo has two different kinds of tigers, two Siberian and one &lt;a href="w%3ASumatran%20tiger"&gt;Sumatran tigers&lt;/a&gt;. The Siberian tigers are named Tony and Tatiana while the Sumatran is named Padang. It is not yet known which of the two Siberian tigers was involved in the attacks.

Last year, another zoo worker was seriously injured by Tatiana while attempting to feed her, but survived the attack.

The temperature in &lt;a href="w%3APerth%2C%20Western%20Australia"&gt;Perth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20Australia"&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt; reached 44.2&amp;deg;&lt;a href="w%3ACelsius"&gt;C&lt;/a&gt; (111&amp;deg;&lt;a href="w%3AFahrenheit"&gt;F&lt;/a&gt;) making it the hottest December day since records commenced, and the seventh hottest day ever recorded in Perth. This combined with the yesterday's second hottest &lt;a href="w%3AChistmas"&gt;Christmas day&lt;/a&gt; of 40.7&amp;deg;C (105&amp;deg;F) and Monday's 35.9&amp;deg;C (97&amp;deg;F) makes this the hottest three-day Christmas period since records began. 

The temperatures have hampered efforts in Perth's southern suburb of &lt;a href="w%3AOrelia%2C%20Western%20Australia"&gt;Orelia&lt;/a&gt; where a fire that is suspected to have been deliberately lit on Monday has caused the closure of the &lt;a href="w%3AKwinana%20Freeway"&gt;Kwinana Freeway&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AThomas%20Road%2C%20Perth"&gt;Thomas road&lt;/a&gt; intersection. The fire has so far burnt out 750 hectares of the Beeliar Regional Park. Alan Gale spokesman from the &lt;a href="w%3AFire%20and%20Emergency%20Services%20Authority%20of%20Western%20Australia"&gt;Fire and Emergency Services Authority of Western Australia&lt;/a&gt; (FESA) said the fire had threatened a number of properties but firefighters had prevented any damage.

Additional fires have occurred around the Perth metro area including in &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Guildford%2C%20Western%20Australia"&gt;South Guildford&lt;/a&gt; in bushland near &lt;a href="w%3APerth%20Airport"&gt;Perth Airport&lt;/a&gt; threatening Palmer Barracks. A fire near the Marangaroo Golf Course in Perth's north flared up in the morning, though the source of the flare looks like it was deliberately lit.

&lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20Australia%20Police"&gt;WA Police Arson squad&lt;/a&gt; are investigating the more than 120 blazes that occurred across Perth since Monday and Mr Gale has asked anyone with information to call crime stoppers. 

<h3>Update</h3>
The fires in Orelia have spread into the rural suburb of &lt;a href="w%3ACasuarina%2C%20Western%20Australia"&gt;Casuarina&lt;/a&gt;, and have now burnt out over 800 hectares. A FESA spokesman has said that three houses had been damaged by the fire, which is out of control. Residents to the east of the fire have been told to evacuate. &lt;a href="w%3ACasuarina%20Prison"&gt;Casuarina Prison&lt;/a&gt; staff are in communication with FESA and have evacuation plans prepared if the conditions change and need arises. 

An evacuation point has been establish at the &lt;a href="w%3ATown%20of%20Kwinana"&gt;Kwinana Council buildings&lt;/a&gt; on Sulphur Road.

Larger and bigger than the &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20World%20Trade%20Center"&gt;Taipei World Trade Center&lt;/a&gt; (TWTC), the &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20World%20Trade%20Center%20Nangang%20Exhibition%20Hall"&gt;Taipei World Trade Center Nangang Exhibition Hall&lt;/a&gt; (TWTC Nangang) was finally completed on December 24.

According to the hall owner, &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan%20External%20Trade%20Development%20Council"&gt;Taiwan External Trade Development Council&lt;/a&gt; (TAITRA), TWTC Nangang owned 2650 booths twice larger than current TWTC (1300 booths), several companies from different industries wanted to exhibit in TWTC Nangang by participating in some international shows, but the competition was apparently intensive because of limitations on booths and scales.

Recently in a press conference, Minister of Economic Affairs of the &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; Steve Ruey-long Chen said to media: "After the TWTC Nangang was finished its construction, it will bring on opportunities for companies from different industries including exhibition industry."

TAITRA also announced that some international shows will be moved to Nangang including the Taipei Cycle, Taipei PLAS, TAITRONICS and Food Taipei. &lt;a href="w%3ACOMPUTEX%20Taipei"&gt;COMPUTEX Taipei&lt;/a&gt; will exhibit in not only TWTC Nangang but also TWTC Hall 1 &amp; 3, Taipei Show (formerly known as TWTC Hall 2), and the Taipei International Convention Center to challenge the largest scale in June, 2008.

Companies wanted to exhibit in the TWTC Nangang, but due to the construction of &lt;a href="w%3ANeihu%20Line%20%28TRTS%29"&gt;Neihu Line of Taipei Metro&lt;/a&gt;, it is still in process, and shows with similar industries will be exhibited in the same schedule respectively at TWTC Hall and TWTC Nangang, the traffic will increase on those two exhibition centers after TWTC Nangang will be launched on March, 2008. TAITRA currently considered moving important trade shows to Nangang rather than domestic market shows.

"Aztec Cup", named and famous in &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; on cyber-gaming industry, started in &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei"&gt;Taipei&lt;/a&gt; today and will run until January 6, 2008 at Taipei New World Shopping Center. Companies like iKala, &lt;a href="w%3ABandai-Namco"&gt;Bandai-Namco&lt;/a&gt;, International Games System, &lt;a href="w%3AKingston%20Technology"&gt;Kingston Technology&lt;/a&gt;, and Seednet all supported this competition to help donations with Child Welfare League Foundation of the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20Of%20China"&gt;Republic Of China&lt;/a&gt; on public welfares.

According to the main organizer, Aztec Master Plan, the Aztec Cup would be scheduled with different gaming natures and populations by seasonal or friendship competitions. Several games might be chosen as the official games frequently in different kind competitions.

By the way for the sponsors, they identically agreed the combination with charity, cyber-gaming, and entertainment by the organizer in winter because it (the competition) can help the disadvantage organizations and developments of the cyber-gaming industry.

Also in the press conference, Taipei New World Shopping Center, the venue owner, mentioned to media: "We [the owner] definitively supported the gaming industry as some good examples like X06 Taiwan, 2006 &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Cyber%20Games"&gt;World Cyber Games&lt;/a&gt; Taiwan Qualifier, and successively held in this venue. We hope the public can participate this competition to support the gaming industry in Taiwan."

Six people were found shot to death inside a home in &lt;a href="w%3ACarnation%2C%20Washington"&gt;Carnation&lt;/a&gt;, a city near &lt;a href="w%3ASeattle%2C%20Washington"&gt;Seattle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Washington"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. 

According to the information officer for the &lt;a href="w%3AKing%20County%2C%20Washington"&gt;King County&lt;/a&gt; sheriff's department, John Urquhart, they were victims of "homicidal violence." Investigators have ruled out &lt;a href="w%3Amurder-suicide"&gt;murder-suicide&lt;/a&gt;.

The deaths are said to have occurred on Christmas Eve, and were discovered by a co-worker of the man living there at 8 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Time%20Zone"&gt;PST&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC-8"&gt;UTC-8&lt;/a&gt;), Wednesday.

"We have an investigation of suspicious deaths," said Detective Bob Conner. There are "no threats to any neighbors in the area," he added.

So far two people, a man and a woman who are only described as being in their twenties, have been arrested in connection with the shooting. ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ says that neither of the two individuals have "access to lawyers" and neither of them have confessed to any wrongdoing.

"This couple was among the people that showed up at the [crime] scene. And as we got to talking to them, we developed probable cause and made the arrests," said &lt;a href="w%3ASergeant"&gt;Sergeant&lt;/a&gt; John Urquhart.

The dead were described as a couple in their 50s, a couple in their 30s, and two children — a 6-year-old girl and a 3-year-old boy.

Authorities describe it as a "complex and large" investigation with over 15 people gathering evidence.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Tiger%20that%20escaped%20enclosure%20at%20San%20Francisco%20Zoo%20may%20have%20%27climbed%27%20over%20wall&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Zoo officials are now saying that a &lt;a href="w%3ASiberian%20tiger"&gt;Siberian tiger&lt;/a&gt; that escaped her enclosure at the &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco%20Zoo"&gt;San Francisco Zoo&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisci%2C%20California"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; on December 25, killing one and severely injuring two humans in the Terrace cafe, may have climbed or jumped over the walls that kept the tiger inside her habitat.

"The animal appears to have climbed or otherwise leaped out of the enclosure. There was no way out through the door," said Robert Jenkins, the zoo's director of animal care and conservation. The tiger has been identified as &lt;a href="w%3ATatiana%20%28tiger%29"&gt;Tatiana&lt;/a&gt;, one of two Siberian tigers at the zoo. The other Siberian, Tony, was not involved in the attacks.

Police, who shot and killed Tatiana, are considering the incident a "crime scene" until they can determine if foul play may have been involved.

"[The incident is being treated as a crime] because we're not certain why the incident occurred - as result of human action or whether this was an incident where the animal was able to get out of the grotto," said Chief of the &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco%20Police%20Department"&gt;San Francisco Police Department&lt;/a&gt; Heather Fong.

The tigers at the zoo are held captive by the combination of a 20ft (6m) tall wall and a 15ft (4.5m) wide moat. Zoo officials say that there are no cameras around the enclosure, and the incident was not caught on any security cameras.

After the incident, all captive animals were counted and accounted for after the zoo was locked down, including the three other tigers that were in the cage. Earlier reports suggested that all of the tigers had escaped, which later turned out to be false.

Reports say that Carlos Sousa, 17, was killed by Tatiana, but the names of those injured have not yet been released. The human victims were all male, aged from their late teens to mid twenties. Both of the injured, aged 19 and 23, suffered severe upper body and arm lacerations, but their conditions have been upgraded from critical to stable condition at &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco%20General%20Hospital"&gt;San Francisco General Hospital&lt;/a&gt;. It was earlier reported that one of the victims might have been a zoo worker, but later reports state all three were visitors.

"Our two victims, I'm happy to report, are doing very well right now. They are in very stable condition; they're in good spirits," said Dr. Rochelle Dicker to reporters at the hospital during a press conference.

Animal experts don't believe that the tiger attacked for food. &lt;a href="w%3AJack%20Hanna"&gt;Jack Hanna&lt;/a&gt;, animal expert and Director Emeritus of the &lt;a href="w%3AColumbus%20Zoo"&gt;Columbus Zoo&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3APowell%2C%20Ohio"&gt;Powell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Ohio"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt; states that its possible someone may have "taunted" or "teased Tatiana."

"Were they taunting the animal? I don't know that right now. Were they throwing things that were making it angry? This is a first in this country. I've never heard of an individual (zoo visitor) being killed by an animal. It's much safer going to a zoo than getting in your car and going down the driveway," stated Hanna.

In 2006, a zoo worker was seriously injured by Tatiana while attempting to feed her, but survived the attack.

The zoo's two surviving tigers remain unexhibited while the investigation continues. The zoo currently has two species of tigers, one Siberian and one &lt;a href="w%3ASumatran%20tiger"&gt;Sumatran tiger&lt;/a&gt;.

On Wednesday, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; signed into law a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;555 billion &lt;a href="w%3Aappropriation%20bill"&gt;appropriation bill&lt;/a&gt;, called the ♡❤Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008♡❤ (aka H.R. 2764).

The bill will keep government agencies running through September 2008. It also includes US$70 billion, which will fund the military efforts in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; well into 2008.

The signing of the bill concluded a battle between Bush and the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Congress"&gt;United States Congress&lt;/a&gt;, during which he threatened to use his &lt;a href="w%3AVeto%23United_States"&gt;Presidential veto&lt;/a&gt;. Even so, Bush complained about the final outcome of the bill:

"I am disappointed in the way the Congress compiled this legislation, including abandoning the goal I set early this year to reduce the number and cost of &lt;a href="w%3AEarmarks%23Earmarks_in_U.S._politics"&gt;earmarks&lt;/a&gt; by half. Instead, the Congress dropped into the bill nearly 9,800 earmarks that total more than $10 billion. These projects are not funded through a merit-based process and provide a vehicle for wasteful Government spending," Bush said in a press release from the &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;.

Former &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Pakistan"&gt;Pakistani Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Benazir%20Bhutto"&gt;Benazir Bhutto&lt;/a&gt; has been killed in a suicide attack as she was leaving a political rally in the city of &lt;a href="w%3ARawalpindi"&gt;Rawalpindi&lt;/a&gt;. At least 21 people died in the attack, local reports say. The attack has been condemned internationally. Earlier in October, a &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Karachi%20bombing"&gt;suicide bomber in Karachi&lt;/a&gt; killed 136 and injured over 450 Benazir Bhutto supporters.

Several reports from witnesses say Bhutto was shot once in the neck and once in the chest before the bomber blew himself up as Bhutto was leaving a rally of her &lt;a href="w%3APakistan%20People%27s%20Party"&gt;Pakistan People's Party&lt;/a&gt; (PPP), for which she was party leader for life, held before elections scheduled for January 8, after years of military rule. 

According to Wasif Ali Khan, a member of Benazir Bhutto's PPP, she died at 18:16 (13:16 UTC), after 35 minutes of attempted resuscitation. The doctors said she had shrapnel injuries. 

Her supporters, once informed of the death started chanting, "Dog Musharraf, dog," referring to President &lt;a href="Pervez%20Musharraf"&gt;Pervez Musharraf&lt;/a&gt;. Many blamed Musharraf and the security services for the deaths. In their anger and confusion, PPP supporters destroyed the doors of Rawalpindi General Hospital. Others took to the streets in several cities, including &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AKarachi"&gt;Karachi&lt;/a&gt;, where tires were set on fire on the roads, a gas station was burned, and two police officers were wounded by gunmen. In &lt;a href="%3Aw%3APeshewar"&gt;Peshewar&lt;/a&gt;, about 100 PPP's supporters blocked the main trunk road, torching billboards and posters of the Musharraf-supporting &lt;a href="%3Aw%3APakistan%20Muslim%20League%20%28Q%29"&gt;Pakistan Muslim League&lt;/a&gt;-Q, opening fire in the air and screaming. Some buildings, including the main court and banks, were set on fire in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AJacobabad"&gt;Jacobabad&lt;/a&gt; as well.
Bhutto was born on June 21, 1953 in Karachi, Pakistan. She served two times as Prime Minister of Pakistan. Bhutto had returned to Pakistan from exile to stand in the upcoming elections. In 2007, she was named the second most influential woman in the world in a list at the American Internet portal &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AMSN"&gt;MSN&lt;/a&gt;.

Benazir Bhutto is survived by her husband Asif Ali Zardari and three children: Bilawal, Bakhtawar, and Aseefa. 

According to many polls taken before the assassination, Bhutto and her party would have won the January election.

<h2>Responses to the assassination</h2>

A spokesman for the Interior Ministry of Pakistan said that "Terrorists are trying to derail the election process". He also said he couldn't say "whether Bhutto was the target of this attack or whether the attacker was trying to create chaos and bloodshed."

The minister for Pakistani external affairs said that he was "shocked," and that his "sympathy goes to [Bhutto's] husband and children". He also said "we were looking forward to democracy in Pakistan. The attack shows terror is on the march in Pakistan."

&lt;a href="India"&gt;Indian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20India"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AManmohan%20Singh"&gt;Manmohan Singh&lt;/a&gt; said that "In her death the subcontinent has lost an outstanding leader who worked for democracy and reconciliation in her country." He also said that "the manner of her going is a reminder of the common dangers that our region faces from cowardly acts of terrorism and of the need to eradicate this dangerous threat."

President Musharraf called for citizens of Pakistan to stay calm and said that terrorists can be defeated, providing people do not panic. He also said there was "a serious lapse of security."

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; said the act that took place was a "cowardly act by murderous extremists who are trying to undermine Pakistan's democracy".

In a statement today, &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; Secretary-General &lt;a href="w%3ABan%20Ki-moon"&gt;Ban Ki-moon&lt;/a&gt; condemned the killing of Bhutto. "I am shocked and outraged by the assassination of Mrs. Benazir Bhutto, the leader of the Pakistan People's Party and former Prime Minister. This represents an assault on stability in Pakistan and its democratic processes," said Ban. "I strongly condemn this heinous crime and call for the perpetrators to be brought to justice as soon as possible."

The Secretary-General also expressed condolences to Bhutto's family and the people of Pakistan. "While strongly urging for calm and restraint to be maintained at this difficult time, I call on all Pakistanis to work together for peace and national unity," said Ban.

Former Pakistani Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ANawaz%20Sharif"&gt;Nawaz Sharif&lt;/a&gt; called it "the saddest day" in Pakistan's history. "Something unthinkable has happened," he said. Sharif said his party will boycott Pakistan's January 8 elections in the wake of Bhutto's death.

The United States Presidential candidates offered condolences to &lt;a href="w%3ABenazir%20Bhutto"&gt;Benazir Bhutto&lt;/a&gt;'s family and to the country of &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; today. Multiple candidates offered up messages about this former foreign leader.

Former Pakistani Prime Minister Bhutto &lt;a href="Benazir%20Bhutto%20killed%20in%20suicide%20attack"&gt;was killed in a suicide attack&lt;/a&gt; as she was leaving a political rally in the city of Rawalpindi. At least 20 people died in the attack, local reports say. The attack has been condemned internationally.

♡❤Slate♡❤ columnist John Dickerson commented that "Moments after former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's death was announced, I was getting e-mails from campaign aides, political obsessives, and the campaigns themselves. The candidates are quick to express their sadness, of course, but everyone is moving so fast because they're trying to muscle into the news cycle more than ever. There's only a week to go before the Iowa caucuses, and this murder lands right in the middle of a key issue in both parties. The ability to react to unpredictable news in a crazy world is at the heart of both primary debates."

<h3>Biden</h3>
Democratic Senator &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Biden"&gt;Joe Biden&lt;/a&gt; was first, holding a press conference at noon EST today, at the Des Moines Marriott hotel, solely to speak on the topic.

<h3>Brownback</h3>

Former &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20minister%20of%20Pakistan"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Benazir%20Bhutto"&gt;Benazir Bhutto&lt;/a&gt;, who was killed in a suicide attack yesterday, has been buried in her ancestral home in the village of &lt;a href="w%3AGarhi%20Khuda%20Bakhsh"&gt;Garhi Khuda Bakhsh&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, violence has erupted across the nation in protest to the 54-year-old opposition leader's death.

The &lt;a href="w%3Apolitics%20of%20Pakistan"&gt;Pakistani government&lt;/a&gt; has claimed to have evidence to suggest that &lt;a href="w%3Aal%20Qaeda"&gt;al Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; were responsible for attacking her at the end of her address to an election rally. One spokesperson for the Interior Ministry said "We have intelligence intercepts indicating that al Qaeda leader &lt;a href="w%3ABaitullah%20Mehsud"&gt;Baitullah Mehsud&lt;/a&gt; is behind her assassination." Mehsud, believed to be in Pakistan near the border with &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, is one of Pakistan's most wanted criminals.

&lt;a href="w%3AMustafa%20Abu%20al-Yazid"&gt;Mustafa Abu al-Yazid&lt;/a&gt;, a head of al Qaeda in Afghanistan, told the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAsia%20Times"&gt;Asia Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ by telephone that the group had indeed been responsible, saying "This is our first major victory against those who have been siding with infidels in a fight against Al Qaeda and declared a war against mujahideen," and that anti-&lt;a href="w%3AShi%27ite"&gt;Shi'ite&lt;/a&gt; militant group &lt;a href="w%3ALashkar-i-Jhangvi"&gt;Lashkar-i-Jhangvi&lt;/a&gt; carried out the attack on al Qaeda's behalf.

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; federal bodies are attempting to verify that al Qaeda were responsible. One official told the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that a bulletin circulated by the &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation"&gt;Federal Bureau of Investigation&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Homeland%20Security"&gt;Department of Homeland Security&lt;/a&gt; to law enforcement groups mentioned several Islamist websites posting claims of responsibility. Director of National Intelligence spokesman Ross Feinstein commented that they were "in no position right now to confirm who may have been responsible."

Unrest in &lt;a href="w%3ASindh"&gt;Sindh&lt;/a&gt;, Bhutto's home province, was to the extent that the military has been called in to the area. According to officials, unrest since her death has resulted in 32 deaths, including those of four police officers. 23 of the deaths were in Sindh. It is feared that recent events could cause &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20Pakistan"&gt;Pakistani President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Pervez%20Musharraf"&gt;Pervez Musharraf&lt;/a&gt; to postpone an election intended to place Pakistan back under civilian rule, which is currently planned for January 8.

Soldiers were told to shoot to kill violent protesters on sight, as scores of people set up roadblocks and torched hundreds of cars, trucks and buses. Other areas also saw violence; an election meeting in the Northwest suffered a bomb attack that killed a candidate for Musharrif's party and seven others, whilst one was killed in the city of &lt;a href="w%3ALahore"&gt;Lahore&lt;/a&gt;.

Thousands lined the way as Bhutto's coffin, draped in the tricolor of the &lt;a href="Pakistan%20People%27s%20Party"&gt;Pakistan People's Party&lt;/a&gt;, was transported the 7km to the family mausoleum, accompanied by Bhutto's husband &lt;a href="w%3AAsif%20Ali%20Zardari"&gt;Asif Ali Zardari&lt;/a&gt;. She was laid to rest alongside the body of her father, &lt;a href="w%3AZulfikar%20Ali%20Bhutto"&gt;Zulfikar Ali Bhutto&lt;/a&gt;, himself a former Prime Minister hung after a military coup. Zardini prayed at the site alongside their three children, son Bilawal, 19, and daughters Bakhtawar, 17 and Aseefa, 14. Bhutto's two brothers, whose deaths remain officially unexplained, are also buried at the site, which she had herself arranged the construction of.

♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reported that many at the scene chanted slogans in opposition to Musharraf and to the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, who for many years have supported Musharraf. "Shame on the killer Musharraf, shame on the killer U.S.," the news agency quoted the mourners as saying. Meanwhile, one farmer told them "Bhutto was my sister and Bhutto was like my mother... With her death, the world has ended for us."

Musharraf, a former army general, seized power in an armed 1999 coup. For many years he has had US support in the hope that he can keep control in the unstable country, which is afflicted with &lt;a href="Islam"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;ic extremist violence.

Economics in the country have also been much affected, Koichi Ogawa, chief portfolio manager at Daiwa SB Investments, commented that "Unrest in Pakistan is eroding the market sentiment dramatically as Pakistan, unlike &lt;a href="North%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;, is known to really have &lt;a href="w%3Anuclear%20weapons"&gt;nuclear weapons&lt;/a&gt;." Although the affect was generally to decrease values, lower risk investments, such as &lt;a href="w%3Agold"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, went up in demand. 

&lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; has reacted to the violence by ordering immediate suspension of all cross-border bus and rail services with Pakistan amid fears that violence will spread. Extremists are known to attack trains, including one attack in February where 68 people died on an Indian train heading for Pakistan. Indian border forces have been put on alert, although no specific threats have yet been identified. Relations between the two countries are peaceful but tense, and Indian border forces regularly go on alert at times of crisis in Pakistan.

The &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco%20Zoo"&gt;San Francisco Zoo&lt;/a&gt; has admitted that the walls of the enclosure around their &lt;a href="w%3ASiberian%20tiger"&gt;Siberian tiger&lt;/a&gt; exhibit are too short. On December 25, &lt;a href="w%3ATatiana%20%28tiger%29"&gt;Tatiana&lt;/a&gt;, one of two Siberians at the Zoo, climbed the wall and attacked three people, killing one. Reports say that Tatiana used her front claws to grab on the observation ledge of the enclosure and pull herself up out of her habitat.

On Wednesday the Director of the Zoo, Manuel A. Mollinedo told the media that the enclosure's wall was 18 feet high, but today he came forward and admitted that the wall was only 12 feet 5 inches high. The &lt;a href="w%3AAssociation%20of%20Zoos%20and%20Aquariums"&gt;Association of Zoos and Aquariums&lt;/a&gt; (AZA) recommends the wall be at least 16 feet high. Mollinedo also said that he believes Tatiana escaped her enclosure by jumping or climbing it.

The Zoo is accredited with the Association through 2011. According to the Association's website, for a zoo or &lt;a href="w%3Aaquarium"&gt;aquarium&lt;/a&gt; to become accredited with the AZA, they must fill out an application and "the [AZA] Accreditation Commission [must] evaluate every zoo or aquarium to make sure it meets AZA's standards for animal management and care, including living environments, social groupings, health, and nutrition. We also make sure that animals are provided with enrichment, which stimulates each animal's natural behavior and provides variety in their daily routine." The commission meets twice a year to evaluate applications.

"The San Francisco Zoo is a great zoo, it's an accredited AZA member in good standing, and it has our support during this difficult time. AZA mandatory accreditation standards require that the San Francisco Zoo provide a thorough report to its independent Accreditation Commission, which will review it and determine any actions that need to be taken. We will not speculate on what action might be taken until the facts are fully reviewed," said a statement on the AZA's website posted on Wednesday.

"AZA-accredited zoos are safe. Until this incident, there had not been a visitor fatality resulting from an animal escape at an AZA-accredited zoo. AZA mandatory accreditation standards require safety and emergency protocols that go beyond federal, state or local requirements. Regular safety training and annual emergency drills are required by these mandatory accreditation standards," added the statement.

According to Mollinedo the Association inspected the Zoo in 2004, but never pointed out that the wall was too short. The enclosure is also surrounded by a dry moat that is 12 feet deep at the corners and 13 feet deep at the center.

Police are still investigating the incident and deny reports that the injured brothers Kulbir Dhaliwal, 23, and Paul Dhaliwal, 19 along with their friend Carlos Sousa Jr., who was killed, were taunting Tatiana by dangling a leg into her enclosure. Police do say that a footprint was found at the scene, but no further details are known. The brothers both received severe upper body and arm lacerations, but are expected to be released from the hospital on Saturday.

"We have no information at this point that they did or did not go over the railing," said Chief of the &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco%20Police%20Department"&gt;San Francisco Police Department&lt;/a&gt;, Heather Fong.

On Wednesday, Fong stated that "[The incident is being treated as a crime] because we're not certain why the incident occurred - as result of human action or whether this was an incident where the animal was able to get out of the grotto."

The Zoo remains closed for business and it is not known when it will reopen.

<h1>South African prosecutors charge ANC leader Jacob Zuma with corruption</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=South%20African%20prosecutors%20charge%20ANC%20leader%20Jacob%20Zuma%20with%20corruption&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
Corruption-related charges have been brought against &lt;a href="w%3AJacob%20Zuma"&gt;Jacob Zuma&lt;/a&gt;, the newly-elected leader of the &lt;a href="African%20National%20Congress"&gt;African National Congress&lt;/a&gt; (ANC), according to his lawyer. A trial is scheduled to begin on August 14, 2008.

The charges stem from an arms deal with a &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; company, which is alleged to have involved bribes and fraud. Zuma's financial adviser at the time, &lt;a href="w%3ASchabir%20Shaik"&gt;Schabir Shaik&lt;/a&gt;, was convicted in 2005 of attempting to solicit a bribe of &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;72,500 per year from the arms company on Zuma's behalf and was sentenced to 15 years in prison. Zuma was fired as deputy president in 2005 by &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20South%20Africa"&gt;South African President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AThabo%20Mbeki"&gt;Thabo Mbeki&lt;/a&gt; due to the scandal.

Two-term ANC leader Mbeki recently lost an ANC leadership contest to Jacob Zuma, who garnered about 60 percent of delegate votes in his win.

Zuma had been charged with corruption in 2005, but the case was dismissed on procedural grounds. Michael Hulley, Zuma's defence lawyer, indicated that they will strongly contest the new charges in court. Hulley also suggested that the South African government's &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Prosecuting%20Authority"&gt;National Prosecuting Authority&lt;/a&gt; (NPA) and its anti-organised crime division known as &lt;a href="w%3AScorpions%20%28South%20Africa%29"&gt;The Scorpions&lt;/a&gt;, have carried out a smear campaign against Zuma.

"These charges will be vigorously defended, in the context of the belief that the Scorpions (NPA) have acted wrongly and with improper motive calculated to discredit Mr. Zuma and ensure that he play no leadership role in the political future of our country," said Michael Hulley in a statement.

Given that the ANC has been the governing party in South Africa since the end of &lt;a href="w%3AHistory%20of%20South%20Africa%20in%20the%20Apartheid%20era"&gt;apartheid&lt;/a&gt; in 1994, it is likely that Jacob Zuma could become the next president after general elections in 2009. Zuma has said, however, that he would resign if he was found guilty by the courts.

&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Hicks"&gt;David Hicks&lt;/a&gt; was released Saturday from &lt;a href="w%3AYatala%20Labour%20Prison"&gt;Yatala Labour Prison&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AAdelaide"&gt;Adelaide&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Australia"&gt;South Australia&lt;/a&gt;.

Hicks, who until May 2007 had been held for five years at the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20Bay%20detention%20camp"&gt;Guantanamo Bay detention camp&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Cuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;, was serving out his remaining sentence in an Australian jail. At a U.S. war crimes tribunal, Hicks pleaded guilty to providing material support to a listed terrorist organisation and was sentenced to seven years in prison. As part of the plea agreement, all but nine months of the sentence was suspended and in May of 2007, Hicks was transferred to Yatala.

A contentious part of his sentence was a ban placed on Hicks to prevent him from speaking with the media for a period of one year from the time he pleaded guilty, which was in March, 2007. On his release Saturday, Hicks indicated that he intended to comply with the suppression order.

"It's my intention to honour this agreement as I don't want to do anything that might result in my return there," said Hicks in a written statement read by his lawyer, David McLeod. "So for now, I will limit what I have to say - I will say more at a later time."

A small group of supporters waited outside of Yatala and cheered as his car drove away. In his statement, Hicks had thanked his supporters for "the huge debt of gratitude that I owe the Australian public for getting me home." He added, "I will not forget or let you down."

At his trial, Hicks admitted he attended training camps in &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, conducted surveillance of the U.S. Embassy in Kabul and revealed that he had met Osama bin Laden, leader of &lt;a href="Al-Qaeda"&gt;Al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;. He had participated in fighting against the U.S. and its allies in Afghanistan in late 2001, and was caught while trying to flee the area.

On his release from prison Saturday, Hicks was driven to an undisclosed location in Adelaide. His lawyer said that Hicks fears for the safety of himself and his family. "David is concerned about the safety of his family from people who hold views he was purported to share," said David McLeod. "There are also a number of far-right nationalist groups in Australia who have spoken out about David."

Terry Hicks, David's father, said his son was pleased to be free. "He's on a high, he seems alright but I suppose in the quiet times everything will come back."

"It's now up to him," said Terry Hicks. "He now has got to get on with his life."

&lt;a href="Scotland"&gt;Scottish&lt;/a&gt; football player &lt;a href="w%3APhil%20O%27Donnell%20%28footballer%29"&gt;Phil O'Donnell&lt;/a&gt; has died today after collapsing during a game in which his team &lt;a href="w%3AMotherwell%20F.C."&gt;Motherwell F.C.&lt;/a&gt;, of which he was captain, were playing &lt;a href="w%3ADundee%20United"&gt;Dundee United&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href="w%3AScottish%20Premier%20League"&gt;Scottish Premier League&lt;/a&gt; match.

O'Donnell collapsed as his substitution for &lt;a href="w%3AMarc%20Fitzpatrick"&gt;Marc Fitzpatrick&lt;/a&gt; was being arranged. He received treatment for around five minutes before being stretchered off and transferred to a waiting ambulance. David Clarkson, O'Donnell's nephew, was also playing at the time and had scored twice but was taken off due to being visibly distressed by O'Donnel's collapse.

Medics from both teams believed he had suffered a seizure. Attempts were made in the ambulance to revive him, but these failed and he was pronounced dead at 17:18 GMT, having been taken to &lt;a href="w%3AWishaw%20General%20Hospital"&gt;Wishaw General Hospital&lt;/a&gt;.

Born on March 25, 1972 O'Donnell made his debut for Motherwell in 1990, and scored the following year in the final of the &lt;a href="w%3A%20Scottish%20Cup"&gt;Scottish Cup&lt;/a&gt;, which Motherwell defeated Dundee United 4-3 in. In 1993 he earned his only international cap for Scotland as a substitute in a &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Cup"&gt;World Cup&lt;/a&gt; qualification match against &lt;a href="Switzerland"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;.

The following year he was bought by &lt;a href="w%3ACeltic"&gt;Celtic&lt;/a&gt; for £1.75 million ($3.5 million). He stayed with them for five years, after which he was transferred to &lt;a href="w%3ASheffield%20Wednesday"&gt;Sheffield Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. A high number of injuries caused Sheffield Wednesday to release him after four years, and the next year, 2004, then Motherwell manager &lt;a href="w%3ATerry%20Butcher"&gt;Terry Butcher&lt;/a&gt; awarded him an 18-month contract. In 2006 he was appointed captain, and in April the following year, upon the expiration of his original contract, signed a new one as a player-coach.

Motherwell chairman &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Dickie"&gt;Bill Dickie&lt;/a&gt; said "Unfortunately I can confirm very, very sad news that Phil O'Donnell has lost his life. We don't know what it was, but there will be a post-mortem. This is a tragic happening and that's all I can say."

Motherwell owner &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Boyle"&gt;John Boyle&lt;/a&gt; told the press "Everyone at Motherwell is shocked to the core, and we are sure that everyone involved in Scottish football will feel the same. Phil was not only an inspirational player for Motherwell and club captain, but was an inspirational person. All of us at Motherwell are thinking of his wife Eileen and their four children."

&lt;a href="w%3AMark%20McGhee"&gt;Mark McGhee&lt;/a&gt;, manager of the team, said "I don't want to say anything more than how devastated everyone at the club is for his wife and his young children. That's what we are all feeling tonight, nothing else matters. Obviously from the club's point of view, we'll gather round to give his family as much support as they need." 

In a press conference given at the hospital, Motherwell chief executive &lt;a href="w%3AIan%20Stillie"&gt;Ian Stillie&lt;/a&gt; said "The management, directors, players and fans are all stunned and having great difficulty in comprehending what has happened over the last few hours. At this stage we do not have all the facts surrounding the tragic death of Phil O'Donnell. We have been in contact with Phil's wife Eileen and his family and they have given us their blessing to speak to the media tonight. Phil collapsed during the second half of the game today. He was standing alone at the time. He was immediately attended to by Motherwell's club doctor and assisted by Dundee United's club doctor. He was transferred almost immediately to an awaiting ambulance and taken to Wishaw General. It is believed Phil suffered some form of seizure and was pronounced dead at 1718." 

&lt;a href="w%3AGordon%20Smith"&gt;Gordon Smith&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AScottish%20Football%20Association"&gt;Scottish Football Association&lt;/a&gt; chief executive, told reporters "This is absolutely devastating news. Phil was not just a wonderful footballer, he was a great human being. My thoughts are with his family at this tragic time." Meanwhile, Celtic chief executive Peter Lawwell said "When the news came through, everyone at the club was obviously shocked. Our thoughts are with his family to whom we offer extreme condolences for a tragic loss of a young life. Everyone at &lt;a href="w%3ACeltic%20Park"&gt;Celtic Park&lt;/a&gt; will mourn him."

The &lt;a href="w%3AOffice%20of%20Rail%20Regulation"&gt;Office of Rail Regulation (ORR)&lt;/a&gt;, the regulatory authority for &lt;a href="w%3AGreat%20Britain"&gt;Great Britain&lt;/a&gt;'s railway network, has launched an investigation of &lt;a href="w%3ANetwork%20Rail"&gt;Network Rail&lt;/a&gt; procedures following a complaint from &lt;a href="w%3AVirgin%20Trains"&gt;Virgin Trains&lt;/a&gt; regarding over-running engineering works on New Year's Eve. 

Network Rail, who are responsible for the British railway infrastructure, have announced that as part of ongoing engineering work to improve the &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Coast%20Main%20Line"&gt;West Coast Main Line&lt;/a&gt;, no services will be able to pass through &lt;a href="w%3ARugby%2C%20Warwickshire"&gt;Rugby&lt;/a&gt; on December 31. 

The closure will affect services operated by Virgin Trains, &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Midland"&gt;London Midland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AFirst%20ScotRail"&gt;First ScotRail&lt;/a&gt;.

Chris Gibb, the Managing Director of Virgin Trains said, "I am very disappointed that Network Rail (NR) has given us so little opportunity to warn our passengers of this further disruption. We were first warned of the possibility of this additional work on 6 December."

"Because of the seriousness of the situation we felt it necessary to refer the matter to the Office of Rail Regulation. We simply cannot have NR bullying train operators in this way just because their engineering planning processes are in a mess."

The company has warned passengers that journeys are likely to be extended by an hour or more in some cases. 

Whilst the ORR will be investigating the complaint from Virgin, they have ruled that the work should still go ahead. 

A spokesman for Network Rail said, "Work will be ongoing for most of the next year, but the Christmas period is the last major opportunity we have to do key work while passenger numbers are down during the relatively long holiday period.

"It was only realised at the beginning of December that work was falling behind. Rail companies are usually given 12 weeks notice of engineering work. Virgin were told only at the beginning of the month, so that is very late.

"Network Rail is extremely sorry and apologises to passengers for the inconvenience."

According to the company, the engineering works will contribute to enabling increases in service frequencies and reductions in journey times on the West Coast Main Line from December 2008.

With a 38-35 victory over the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Giants"&gt;New York Giants&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3AGiants%20Stadium"&gt;Giants Stadium&lt;/a&gt; Saturday night, the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20England%20Patriots"&gt;New England Patriots&lt;/a&gt; became the second team in the modern era of the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Football%20League"&gt;National Football League&lt;/a&gt; to go undefeated (16-0) in the regular season. The only other team to have achieved this feat was the &lt;a href="w%3AMiami%20Dolphins"&gt;Miami Dolphins&lt;/a&gt; in 1972, who were 14-0 due to a different &lt;a href="w%3ARegular%20season%20%28NFL%29"&gt;regular season&lt;/a&gt; structure at the time.

Trailing by as many as 12 points in the third quarter, the Patriots soon came back with touchdowns from running back &lt;a href="w%3ALaurence%20Maroney"&gt;Laurence Maroney&lt;/a&gt; and wide receiver &lt;a href="w%3ARandy%20Moss"&gt;Randy Moss&lt;/a&gt;.

Two other NFL records were broken in the course of one play; with 11:06 remaining in the game, quarterback &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Brady"&gt;Tom Brady&lt;/a&gt; threw a pass to Moss for a touchdown. This broke &lt;a href="w%3APeyton%20Manning"&gt;Peyton Manning&lt;/a&gt;'s record of 49 touchdown passes and &lt;a href="w%3AJerry%20Rice"&gt;Jerry Rice&lt;/a&gt;'s record of 22 touchdown catches. The Patriots also ended up with a record-high 589 points for the season.

"In this game of football, it's hard to go 16-and-0," Moss stated. "As a football player and a fan of the game, my hat's off to this organization."

&lt;a href="w%3ADon%20Shula"&gt;Don Shula&lt;/a&gt;, coach of the undefeated 1972 Miami Dolphins, commended the Patriots, saying "going undefeated during the regular season is a remarkable achievement."

In an attempt to reach as many viewers as possible, the game was &lt;a href="w%3Asimulcast"&gt;simulcast&lt;/a&gt; on three networks, with the coverage from &lt;a href="w%3ANFL%20Network"&gt;NFL Network&lt;/a&gt; (only digital/satellite channel) being broadcast on &lt;a href="w%3ANBC"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACBS"&gt;CBS&lt;/a&gt;. This was the first NFL game to be nationally televised on more than one broadcast network since &lt;a href="w%3ASuper%20Bowl%20I"&gt;Super Bowl I&lt;/a&gt; in 1967.

&lt;a href="AOL"&gt;AOL&lt;/a&gt; has decided to discontinue development of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANetscape"&gt;Netscape&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aweb%20browser"&gt;web browser&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; which brought surfing the Internet to the masses, until its user base began to erode during the "browser wars" of the mid-1990s and resulted in the birth of Mozilla project.

Tom Drapeau, the director of Netscape inside AOL announced on the Netscape blog that support for the recently released &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANetscape%20Navigator%209"&gt;Netscape Navigator 9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and all of Netscape's browsers back to version 1.0, will end because it was unable to gain market share and a low number of users that continues to dwindle. Drapeau noted, "AOL's focus on transitioning to an ad-supported web business leaves little room for the size of investment needed to get the Netscape browser to a point many of its fans expect it to be," and that "the success the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMozilla%20Foundation"&gt;Mozilla Foundation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has had in developing critically-acclaimed products, we feel it's the right time to end development of Netscape branded browsers, hand the reins fully to Mozilla and encourage Netscape users to adopt Firefox."

Netscape's origins lie at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Center%20for%20Supercomputing%20Applications"&gt;National Center for Supercomputing Applications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Illinois%20at%20Urbana-Champaign"&gt;University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; where Netscape's co-founders, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMarc%20Andreessen"&gt;Marc Andreessen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEric%20Bina"&gt;Eric Bina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wrote their first copy of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANCSA%20Mosaic"&gt;NCSA Mosaic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; which became the first popular web browser and opened up the web for the first time to the general public and started the rise of the Internet in everyday life. 

Andreessen along with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Clark"&gt;Jim Clark&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the founder of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASilicon%20Graphics"&gt;Silicon Graphics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , started the Mosaic Communications Corporation and released their first product Mosaic Netscape 0.9 in October 1994. A month later the company became the name it is today, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANetscape%20Communications%20Corporation"&gt;Netscape Communications Corporation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to avoid legal problems from NCSA. A year later, had a successful IPO on August 9, 1995 and the stock closed the day at $75.

Netscape's early success and virtual monopoly of the browser market was short-lived however as &lt;a href="Microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; viewed Netscape's idea of a consistent browser across various operating systems a threat and quickly began development of its own browser, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20Explorer"&gt;Internet Explorer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

This competition between Netscape and Microsoft became known as the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Abrowser%20wars"&gt;browser wars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , where both companies tried to outdo each other with their increasingly unstable browsers including: new features that did not always work, not providing bug fixes, deviating from Web standards (including the infamous &lt;blink&gt; and &lt;marquee&gt; HTML tags), program crashes and security holes.
By the end of 1997, Netscape's glory had run out and it experienced it's first bad quarter, which resulted in layoffs in January 1998. The new year also brought the world with the arrival of what would eventually become Mozilla and later Firefox, when Netscape decided to make the source code for their browser &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aopen%20source"&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . A year later, Netscape was out of steam and was no longer an independent company but now a subsidiary of America Online.
The most recent version of the Netscape browser, Navigator 9, was for the most part was a re-skinned version of Firefox developed internally by a small group of people inside AOL. Netscape's actual browser development division was closed back in July 2003 and the workers laid off.

However, AOL continues to run Netscape as a brand including a web portal, including a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADigg"&gt;Digg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -like social news aggregator which was branded as Netscape.com from June 2006 till September 2007, when it was spun off into a renamed site called Propeller. Netscape.com is now a dually branded AOL Netscape web portal, which is a duplicate of AOL.com. Netscape is also used as a brand by AOL as a low-cost dial-up &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20service%20provider"&gt;Internet service provider&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Firefox's third version is currently available as a beta and Microsoft is expected to release Internet Explorer 8 sometime in 2008.

A 55-year-old &lt;a href="w%3Aorangutan"&gt;orangutan&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href="w%3ANonja"&gt;Nonja&lt;/a&gt;, who was believed to be the oldest living orangutan in the world both in captivity and the wild, has died at the &lt;a href="w%3AMiami%20MetroZoo"&gt;Miami MetroZoo&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AMiami%2C%20Florida"&gt;Miami&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;.

"Everybody's very sad, especially with an animal like an orangutan. You see a lot of yourself in these animals. The great apes are our closest relatives. She was really a grand old dame," said zoo spokesman Ron Magill.

Nonja, which means 'girl' in Dutch, was born in 1952 in &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; on the island of &lt;a href="w%3ASumatra"&gt;Sumatra&lt;/a&gt;. She arrived at the Miami MetroZoo in 1983. Her death is believed to have been caused by a small brain tumor or &lt;a href="w%3Aaneurysm"&gt;aneurysm&lt;/a&gt; which ruptured.

According to the zoo, an orangutan normally only lives about 40-50 years. Orangutans are part of an endangered species and in 2003, only about 7,300 were believed to be left living in the wild.

At least 250 people have died in &lt;a href="Kenya"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt; in post-election clashes across the nation. Incumbent President &lt;a href="Mwai%20Kibaki"&gt;Mwai Kibaki&lt;/a&gt; was declared re-elected on Sunday in a close vote. His opponent &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARaila%20Odinga"&gt;Raila Odinga&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; disputes the result and has called for a recount.

The clashes have been along tribal lines, with Kibaki backed by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKikuyu"&gt;Kikuyu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and Odinga by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALuo"&gt;Luo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The fighting has been particularly severe in western Kenya, a power base for Odinga. Police have been ordered to shoot looters on sight and have imposed a curfew in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKisumu"&gt;Kisumu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Kenya's third largest city.
&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKibera"&gt;Kibera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the slum in &lt;a href="Nairobi"&gt;Nairobi&lt;/a&gt;, has been sealed off by riot police and paramilitary troops to contain violence. 

The Kenyan government has banned live television broadcasts and censored news reports in what it says is an effort to prevent violence.

Odinga also announced that he wanted a mass rally to take place later in the day in the main park of Nairobi.

The violence led to an announcement by Kenyan police which stated that any person caught outside their homes in the slums of Nairobi will be shot dead on the spot.

In the riots, some residents who believed the vote was rigged, took extreme measures. Houses have been burned down, and some people have had the intention of killing others.

A woman in &lt;a href="Egypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt; has died of the &lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt; strain of &lt;a href="w%3Abird%20flu"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt;. H5N1 has killed two other Egyptian women already this week, bringing the total dead of the virus in Egypt to 18.

Fardous Mahammed Hadad was taken into hospital on Sunday after having difficulty breathing and developing a high fever, and subsequently tested positive for bird flu. She died today, at the age of 36.

As well as Hadad, who was from &lt;a href="w%3AMenoufia"&gt;Menoufia&lt;/a&gt;, this week saw the deaths of Fatima Fathi Mohammed from &lt;a href="w%3ADaqahliya"&gt;Daqahliya&lt;/a&gt; and Ola Youness Mohammed from &lt;a href="w%3ABeni%20Suef"&gt;Beni Suef&lt;/a&gt;. They all died from H5N1; Ola Youness Mohammed's case was Egypt's first since July. In addition, the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organisation"&gt;World Health Organisation&lt;/a&gt; says two further woman are infected without giving any further details; the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; health agency says that on December 24 a 50-year-old woman was hospitalised and remains in critical condition, whilst a chicken seller, 22, is recovering from the infection in intensive care. 

Egypt's Ministry of Health has recorded a total of 42 confirmed cases of H5N1 infection, including the 18 fatal cases. Most of the cases, including the latest death, were females who had daily contact with &lt;a href="w%3Achicken"&gt;chicken&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href="w%3Aturkey"&gt;turkey&lt;/a&gt;s, most keeping the animals in their back yards. Egypt's first case of bird flu was in February 2006.

Bird flu began in &lt;a href="Asia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt; in 2003, and since then has spread across 45 countries worldwide, killed at least 212 people of 340 infections and triggered the killing of millions of birds. Egypt is one of the worst-hit non-Asian countries, due in part to a combination of its location along the paths taken by many migratory birds and the fact that many people keep fowl close to their homes. It is feared that if the virus mutates into a form that can be easily transferred from human to human the result could be a global &lt;a href="w%3Apandemic"&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt; causing millions of deaths.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Grandfather%20held%20in%20Guantanamo%20dies%20of%20cancer&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3AJoint%20Task%20Force%20Guantanamo"&gt;Joint Task Force Guantanamo&lt;/a&gt; (JTF-GTMO) reported a fifth Guantanamo captive, named &lt;a href="w%3AAbdul%20Razzak%20%28Guantanamo%20detainee%20942%29"&gt;Abdul Razzak&lt;/a&gt;, died in captivity, on December 30, 2007.

JTF-GTMO asserted that Razzak had complained of abdominal pains in September 2007, and had begun to receive cancer therapy in late October 2007. JTF-GTMO estimated that he was born in 1939.

According to the JTF-GTMO press release that announced his death:
&lt;blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;"&gt; Abdul Razzak was assessed to be an experienced jihadist with command responsibilities and was assessed to have had multiple links to anti-coalition forces. He was detained in Guantanamo as an enemy combatant, consistent with the international law of Armed Conflict.
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Abdul Razzak was one of the few Guantanamo captives who continued to attend his &lt;a href="w%3ACombatant%20Status%20Review%20Tribunal"&gt;Combatant Status Review Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; and his annual &lt;a href="w%3AAdministrative%20Review%20Board"&gt;Annual Review Board hearings&lt;/a&gt;. 

Abdul Razzak had disputed all but one of the allegations against him, at each opportunity, and had provided his JTF-GTMO interrogators and the officers who sat on his CSR Tribunal and ARB hearing with easily verifiable corroborated details. At each of his Administrative review the officers were unaware of the exculpatory details he had provided.

The one allegation that Abdul Razzak acknowledged was that he had been subjected to involuntary conscription, and had served the &lt;a href="w%3ATaliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt; for three months out of every year for the five years they were in power before he fled Afghanistan. He had, however, not served in the Taliban's armed forces, but had been a truck driver, delivering non-military supplies.

One of the main allegations against Abdul Razzak was that he had plotted to help free Taliban leaders. Abdul Razzak testified that, on the contrary, two years prior to al Qaeda's attacks on September 11th, 2001, he and his son had played a key role in a successful plot to free three imprisoned senior Northern Alliance leaders, who he identified as ♡❤"&lt;a href="w%3AIsmail%20Khan"&gt;Ismail Khan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHaji%20Zahir"&gt;Haji Zahir&lt;/a&gt;, son of vice president &lt;a href="w%3AAbdul%20Qadir%20%28Afghan%20leader%29"&gt;Haji Qadir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGeneral%20Qassim"&gt;General Qassim&lt;/a&gt;."♡❤ -- Ismail Khan is currently the Minister of Energy.

Abdul Razzak testified that his son, one of the relatively few Afghans who was fluent in English, had been conscripted by the Taliban, so he could provide some computer support. His son had contacted anti-Taliban forces, secured funds to purchase a four-wheel drive vehicle. His son, using the trust the Taliban had placed in him, due to his computer support, had lead the three men out of their imprisonment. Abdul Razzak had driven the four by four. 
The vehicle was damaged by a land mine. Abdul Razzak's hand was injured. His son lost a foot. But the Northern Alliance leaders were rescued.

Abdul Razzak testified that when they arrived in Iran the Afghanistan Council paid his living expenses. But, when Hamid Karzai assumed power, following the ouster of the Taliban, he was told that the pension would be discontinued, because Afghanistan now had a democratic government. 

Abdul Razzak testified that he then returned to Afghanistan, where he was falsely denounced by a distant cousin named &lt;a href="w%3AMohammad%20Jan"&gt;Mohammed Jan&lt;/a&gt;. Mohammed Jan's branch of the family was engaged in a feud with his branch, that had lead to the death of his father, two uncles, and three of his sons.

Abdul Razzak was also accused of being a leader of anti-coalition forces, and of being a member of the &lt;a href="w%3AHezb-e-Islami%20Gulbuddin"&gt;Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin&lt;/a&gt;, an older militia, which was first founded to oppose the regime of &lt;a href="w%3AMohammed%20Daoud%20Khan"&gt;Mohammed Daoud Khan&lt;/a&gt;,
the politician who had ousted &lt;a href="w%3AMohammed%20Zahir%20Shah"&gt;Mohammed Zahir Shah&lt;/a&gt;, the last King of Afghanistan, in 1973.
In 1979 this militia split, and has been lead, since then, 
by &lt;a href="w%3AGulbuddin%20Hekmatyar"&gt;Gulbuddin Hekmatyar&lt;/a&gt;.
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's militia played a major role in the resistance to the &lt;a href="w%3ASoviet%20occupation%20of%20Afghanistan"&gt;Soviet occupation of Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;. This militia acquired a reputation for ruthlessness, and disregard for civilian life.

Abdul Razzak testified that his only contact with the Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin militia was early in the war against the Soviets. He testified he was imprisoned for four and a half months in an underground pit. They had captured him because he had served as a driver for a member of the communist regime.

American intelligence analysts assert that, when &lt;a href="w%3AOsama%20bin%20Laden"&gt;Osama bin Laden&lt;/a&gt; was leaving &lt;a href="w%3ASudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt;, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar offered him sanctuary in the areas of Afghanistan under his control.

Although not part of the &lt;a href="w%3AAfghan%20Northern%20Alliance"&gt;Northern Alliance&lt;/a&gt; the Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin militia fought with the Taliban, prior to their ouster. When the USA allied with the Northern Alliance and other resistance forces to oust the Taliban the Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin militia fought against the USA. In 2003 the Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin formed an alliance with the rump of the Taliban.

Abdul Razzak was also accused of being the Abdul Razak who had been the second in command of the Taliban's &lt;a href="w%3A40-man%20unit"&gt;40-man unit&lt;/a&gt;, even though witnesses described Abdul Razak the commander as a much younger man, with a full black beard. Americans held five other men in Guantanamo named Abdul Razak.

&lt;a href="w%3ASara%20Jane%20Moore"&gt;Sara Jane Moore&lt;/a&gt;, 77, who tried to &lt;a href="w%3Aassassination"&gt;assassinate&lt;/a&gt; Former &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="w%3AGerald%20Ford"&gt;Gerald Ford&lt;/a&gt; in 1975 was paroled from prison in &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; this afternoon.

Moore tried to assassinate Ford outside of the St. Francis Hotel in downtown San Francisco on January 15, by firing one shot, which missed because a bystander grabbed Moore's arms just seconds before she fired the gun. The bullet missed hitting Ford in the head by inches.

It is not yet known why she was released or what the conditions of her release were.

In 2006, Ford died from natural causes. He was 93.

Officials and biologists for several federal state and local agencies including the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Oceanic%20and%20Atmospheric%20Administration"&gt;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (NOAA) and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMote%20Marine%20Laboratory"&gt;Mote Marine Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are currently observing a 30 foot &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASperm%20whale"&gt;Sperm whale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; off &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;'s west coast that may be stranded. It was first spotted by a fisherman.

For a while on Sunday, the whale, which is believed to be juvenile, was stuck on a sandbar near the city of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Petersburg%2C%20Florida"&gt;St. Petersburg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Currently it is swimming in just nine feet of water less than half a mile off shore and officials are determining how to proceed with the situation. Its sex has not yet been determined.

"They’re assessing the situation to decide what they need to do. A sheriff’s office boat is there to keep the interested public at an appropriate, safe distance. We don’t want anybody to get hurt, and we don’t want to stress the whale any more than it is," said spokeswoman for Mote, Nadine Slimak.

It is rare for a Sperm whale to come to shore. In the past 10 years, two dead whales washed up on the western shores of Florida. In 2003 a live whale had to be put to sleep after researchers determined it was ill and came ashore to die.

Sperm whales are the most common of all the whales in the &lt;a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico"&gt;Gulf of Mexico&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="South%20Australia"&gt;South Australian&lt;/a&gt; Premier &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Rann"&gt;Mike Rann&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has said that &lt;a href="David%20Hicks"&gt;David Hicks&lt;/a&gt;, a convicted terrorism supporter, should apologise unconditionally to the &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n public for his actions.

Hicks, who was released from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AYatala%20Labour%20Prison"&gt;Yatala Labour Prison&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAdelaide"&gt;Adelaide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , was expected to make an apology upon release, but his lawyer read a prepared statement instead. He spent six years at &lt;a href="Guantanamo%20Bay"&gt;Guantanamo Bay&lt;/a&gt; before being convicted of providing material support to terrorists.

Mr. Rann says it would be appropriate for Hicks to apologise.

"Rather than working for the &lt;a href="Afghan%20Taliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt;, I think it's appropriate for Mr. Hicks to make an apology to the people of Australia," Rann stated.

Prime Minister &lt;a href="Kevin%20Rudd"&gt;Kevin Rudd&lt;/a&gt; has said that Hicks "should be treated no differently to any other Australian citizen in these circumstances".

A fire in the Borrabbin National Park between &lt;a href="w%3ASouthern%20Cross%2C%20Western%20Australia"&gt;Southern Cross&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACoolgardie%2C%20Western%20Australia"&gt;Coolgardie&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20Australia"&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt;, has so far burnt out 29,000 hectares and killed three truck drivers when the convoy they were travelling in was engulfed by the flames. &lt;a href="w%3AGreat%20Eastern%20Highway"&gt;Great Eastern Highway&lt;/a&gt; the primary road for all traffic from Perth heading to the East Coast of Australia has been closed. An alternate route is in place, police are diverting traffic at &lt;a href="w%3ANorseman%2C%20Western%20Australia"&gt;Norseman&lt;/a&gt;. The diversion adds 250 km(160 mi) for the journey to &lt;a href="w%3APerth%2C%20Western%20Australia"&gt;Perth&lt;/a&gt;.

The three truck drivers died on Sunday night after they joined a convoy that was released from Coolgardie after being told that the road was safe. Kieran McNamara director general of the Department of Environment and Conservation(DEC) admitted that it had been caught out by its decision to reopen the road at 8pm (wst) on 30 December. 

Mr McNamara said "The decision was made with the advice from people at the firefront, and with the latest weather forecasts, and was judged to be the right decision and the safe decision at the time and in those circumstances... Regrettably and with hindsight, that’s not how it’s turned out."

The driver of another truck in the convoy that was destroyed escaped with burns to his hands and was rushed through the fire front by firefighters to &lt;a href="w%3AYellowdine%2C%20Western%20Australia"&gt;Yellowdine&lt;/a&gt;, another driver was rescued uninjured and return to Coolgardie, a spokesman for Whiteline transport the owners of this truck were thankful their driver survived unharmed saying the cost of the vehicle lost was about AU$400,000 plus cargo. Police confirmed that four trucks were destroyed by the fire. 

&lt;a href="w%3AFire%20and%20Emergency%20Services%20Authority%20of%20Western%20Australia"&gt;Fire and Emergency Services Authority of Western Australia&lt;/a&gt; reported that they were fighting the fire without using water. All efforts were focused on building fire breaks with heavy machinery to contain the fire, that 90 volunteer fire fighters on the scene were there to defend the bulldozers. 

The fire is still burning on a 150 km (90 mi) front, DEC spokesman says fire fighters are hoping to bring the fire under control with an expected cool change on Wednesday. The Weather Bureau has forecast temperatures to return above 40&amp;deg;C(105&amp;deg;F) by Thursday.
Local Police say that Great Eastern Highway will remain closed until the fire is under control and the damaged vehicles have been removed from the scene, at this stage its not expected to occur before Sunday.

In the "2008 Taipei City New Year Countdown Party", several local and foreign media focused on the fireworks of the Taipei 101 due to the notability of the skyscraper world-wide.

After some criticism from government executives because some wordmarks by sponsors appeared on the &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20101"&gt;Taipei 101&lt;/a&gt;, the Taipei Financial Center (owner of Taipei 101) decided to set up 12,000 sparklers 500 meters tall from the 34th floor to the top of the tower on the 101st floor.

Even though the ingredients of the sparklers were made in &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, Vice President of Taipei 101 Michael Liu commented that the idea issues on quality of production and trends of industry.

According to TV channel &lt;a href="w%3ATVBS"&gt;TVBS&lt;/a&gt;, the light of "Love Taiwan" wordmarks accidentally appeared before the celebration while &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;President of the Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AChen%20Shui-bian"&gt;Shui-bian Chen&lt;/a&gt; addressed in the "2008 Dream More Kaohsiung" New Year Celebration in &lt;a href="w%3AKaohsiung%20City"&gt;Kaohsiung City&lt;/a&gt;. After the Taipei City Government became aware of this accident and remonstrated against current Chairman of Taipei 101 Diana Chen, the Taipei 101 re-lighted the wordmark after successfully celebrating New Year's.

After this incident, Michael Liu said to media: "We [Taipei 101] earlier lighted (the wordmarks) in a rush after we received a call from the &lt;a href="w%3AExecutive%20Yuan"&gt;Executive Yuan&lt;/a&gt;. Originally, we didn't consider to do this."

Current &lt;a href="w%3AMayor%20of%20Taipei"&gt;Mayor of Taipei&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AHau%20Lung-pin"&gt;Lung-pin Hau&lt;/a&gt; regretted the incident and hoped the Executive Yuan could notify the government in the future of the incident. The Minister of the Government Information Office Jhy-wey Hsieh complained in the City's Government of the sponsorships. The 2008 Taipei City New Year Countdown Party was apparently "faded" with political factor.

Today at midnight, the &lt;a href="Cyprus"&gt;Republic of Cyprus&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="Malta"&gt;Republic of Malta&lt;/a&gt;, both small &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIsland%20country"&gt;island states&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the &lt;a href="Mediterranean%20Sea"&gt;Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt; and former &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20colonies"&gt;British colonies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , adopted the &lt;a href="euro"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt; as their official currency; less than four years after their accession to the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;. Because Cyprus and Malta are in different &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATime%20zone"&gt;time zones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Cyprus adopted the euro one hour before Malta did the same. In both countries the euro was welcomed with outdoor celebrations, including a fireworks display in Malta's capital &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AValletta"&gt;Valletta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . According to the &lt;a href="BBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; Cypriot Finance Minister Michalis Sarris has said the euro "will benefit consumers and businesses alike because of the eurozone's low inflation, low interest rates and large market."

The BBC reports that Cypriot and Maltese leaders "made symbolic withdrawals of euros from cash machines just minutes into the New Year." &lt;a href="TIME"&gt;TIME&lt;/a&gt; reports that &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Malta"&gt;Maltese Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALawrence%20Gonzi"&gt;Lawrence Gonzi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; had to wait a little while before getting his hands on the new currency because "an automated teller machine did not work when Gonzi tried to withdraw euros, and he was obliged to use a different ATM."

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACypriot%20pound"&gt;Cypriot pound&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (CYP) and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMaltese%20lira"&gt;Maltese lira&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (MTL) will remain in use during a dual circulation period that will last until the end of this month, at which point they will cease to be legal tender. However, it will still be possible to exchange them for Euro free of charge after the end of this period. Commercial banks in Cyprus will exchange Cypriot pounds for Euro until 30 June, but only for amounts up to CYP 1000 per customer and per transaction in banknotes and up to CYP 5O in coins. The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Bank%20of%20Cyprus"&gt;Central Bank of Cyprus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; will exchange coins until the end of 2009 and banknotes until the end of 2017. Maltese commercial banks will exchange Maltese lira for Euro until the end of March, with a limit for non-customers of MTL 250, whereas the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Bank%20of%20Malta"&gt;Central Bank of Malta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; will exchange coins until 1 February 2010 and banknotes until 1 February 2018.

The single currency has replaced the Cypriot pound and the Maltese lira at a rate of one euro to 0.585274 Cypriot pound and 0.4293 to the Maltese lira, or 1.71 euro per Cypriot pound and 2.33 per Maltese lira. This conversion rate had been fixed on 10 July 2007 by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEconomic%20and%20Financial%20Affairs%20Council"&gt;Ecofin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the council comprising the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFinance%20minister"&gt;finance ministers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the EU Member States.

Cyprus and Malta are the 14th and the 15th country to join the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEurozone"&gt;Eurozone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which already includes &lt;a href="Austria"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Belgium"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Finland"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Luxembourg"&gt;Luxembourg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Portugal"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Greece"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Slovenia"&gt;Slovenia&lt;/a&gt;. All &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union%20member%20state"&gt;EU Member States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are required to join the Eurozone once certain conditions are fulfilled, except &lt;a href="Denmark"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; which have negotiated a so-called &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOpt-outs%20in%20the%20European%20Union"&gt;opt-out&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that allows them not to adopt the single currency.

The &lt;a href="Northern%20Cyprus"&gt;Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus&lt;/a&gt;, the ♡❤de facto♡❤ independent Turkish-controlled area in the north of Cyprus, will not join the Eurozone. Northern Cyprus is not part of the European Union and is recognised only by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATurkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . As a result, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATurkish%20lira"&gt;Turkish lira&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; will remain the official currency in the north of the island; however, TIME reports that "many Turkish Cypriot merchants will also accept euros along with Turkish lira." Cypriot Euro coins are inscribed in both &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGreek%20language"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATurkish%20language"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The euro will also be legal tender in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASovereign%20Base%20Areas"&gt;Sovereign Base Areas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , British military bases in Cyprus.

The national sides of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACypriot%20Euro%20coins"&gt;Cypriot Euro coins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; feature three separate designs for the three series of coins. The 1, 2 and 5-cent coins feature the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Amouflon"&gt;mouflon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , or wild sheep, the 10, 20 and 50-cent coins feature the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKyrenia%20ship"&gt;Kyrenia ship&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the wreck of a 4th century BC Greek merchant ship discovered in 1967 and salvaged closed to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKyrenia"&gt;Kyrenia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and the €1 and €2 coins feature the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIdol%20of%20Pomos"&gt;Idol of Pomos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a prehistoric sculpture from the village of Pomos, three national symbols of Cyprus. The designs were jointly created by Tatiana Soteropoulos and Erik Maell.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMaltese%20euro%20coins"&gt;Maltese euro coins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ' national sides will also feature national motifs. The 1, 2 and 5-cent coins will feature the altar of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMnajdra"&gt;Mnajdra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; temple grouping, a complex of three Neolithic temples on the southern coast of Malta and one of the oldest free-standing temple groupings in the world, the 10, 20 and 50-cent coins will feature the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACoat%20of%20Arms%20of%20Malta"&gt;Coat of Arms of Malta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and the €1 and €2 coins will bear the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMaltese%20cross"&gt;Maltese cross&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a symbol associated with an order of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChristianity"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; warriors known as the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKnights%20Hospitaller"&gt;Knights Hospitaller&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; or Knights of Malta, which was based on Malta for more than 250 years after they had been given the islands by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20V%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor"&gt;Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The designs of Maltese engraver Noel Galea Bason were selected after two rounds of public consultations in which people were invited to vote via &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AShort%20message%20service"&gt;SMS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Both Cyprus and Malta have taken a number of steps to address fears of undue price rises. 7,130 Cypriot companies have subscribed to a Fair Pricing Code launched by the authorities and the Cypriot government urged companies to round their prices down. In Malta, the FAIR initiative, a fair pricing scheme, was put in place in January 2007. This scheme, which provides for administrative fines for those failing to respect their commitment, now involves 80% of all retail outlets. Malta, according to the &lt;a href="BBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;, has also signed 12 price stabilisation agreements with importers, which will last until March 2008.

In both countries, the authorities will monitor retailers to ensure they do not exploit the changeover for unfair gain by rounding up their prices, contributing to inflation.

On New Year's Day, the &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%20Sabres"&gt;Buffalo Sabres&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APittsburgh%20Penguins"&gt;Pittsburgh Penguins&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Hockey%20League"&gt;National Hockey League&lt;/a&gt; played in the &lt;a href="w%3AAMP%20Energy%20NHL%20Winter%20Classic"&gt;AMP Energy NHL Winter Classic&lt;/a&gt;, an outdoor game held at &lt;a href="w%3AOrchard%20Park%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Orchard Park&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ARalph%20Wilson%20Stadium"&gt;Ralph Wilson Stadium&lt;/a&gt;. This was the second outdoor game in league history and the first outdoor game held in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.

The Penguins won the game 2 to 1 after a &lt;a href="w%3Ashootout"&gt;shootout&lt;/a&gt; in which &lt;a href="w%3ASidney%20Crosby"&gt;Sidney Crosby&lt;/a&gt; made a goal between the legs of goalie &lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Miller"&gt;Ryan Miller&lt;/a&gt; to win it. &lt;a href="w%3AColby%20Armstrong"&gt;Colby Armstrong&lt;/a&gt; of the Penguins scored 21 seconds into the game, and &lt;a href="w%3ABrian%20Campbell"&gt;Brian Campbell&lt;/a&gt; scored the lone goal for the Sabres in the 2nd period.

A temporary ice rink was built on the field at Ralph Wilson Stadium, which normally hosts games played by the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Football%20League"&gt;National Football League&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%20Bills"&gt;Buffalo Bills&lt;/a&gt;. 

Snow and heavy winds were prevalent throughout the game, and &lt;a href="w%3AZamboni"&gt;Zamboni&lt;/a&gt;s were brought out to clear the ice in the middle of each period. The temperature was around the &lt;a href="w%3Afreezing%20point"&gt;freezing point&lt;/a&gt; when the game began at 1:20 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Standard%20Time"&gt;ET&lt;/a&gt;.

Several rule changes were in effect in order to lessen the impact of the weather on gameplay. These changes included stopping play in the middle of the 3rd period to allow teams to switch sides and dividing the overtime period into two 2:30 segments. In the shootout, the goalies were allowed to choose which side to defend, with both choosing the same side.

The attendance for the game was 71,217, beating the record of 57,167 at the &lt;a href="w%3AHeritage%20Classic"&gt;Heritage Classic&lt;/a&gt;, another outdoor game which was held in 2003 between the &lt;a href="w%3AMontreal%20Canadiens"&gt;Montreal Canadiens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AEdmonton%20Oilers"&gt;Edmonton Oilers&lt;/a&gt;. Two of the Edmonton players in the Heritage Classic, &lt;a href="w%3AGeorges%20Laraque"&gt;Georges Laraque&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATy%20Conklin"&gt;Ty Conklin&lt;/a&gt;, played for Pittsburgh in the Winter Classic.

Tickets to the game were made available to the general public on September 18, 2007; all 41,000 were sold out within 30 minutes.

&lt;a href="Finland"&gt;Finnish&lt;/a&gt; actor &lt;a href="w%3AMarkku%20Peltola"&gt;Markku Peltola&lt;/a&gt; has died. He was 51.

Peltola was most well known for starring in the 2002 &lt;a href="w%3AAki%20Kaurism%C3%A4ki"&gt;Aki Kaurismäki&lt;/a&gt;-directed film ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Man%20Without%20a%20Past"&gt;The Man Without a Past&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, which won a Grand Prix award at the &lt;a href="w%3ACannes%20Film%20Festival"&gt;Cannes Film Festival&lt;/a&gt; and was nominated for an &lt;a href="w%3AAcademy%20Award"&gt;Academy Award&lt;/a&gt; for Best Foreign Film.

He also had supporting roles in ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ADrifting%20Clouds"&gt;Drifting Clouds&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ (1996) and ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AJuha"&gt;Juha&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ (1999), both directed by Kaurismaki. In total he had played over 30 roles in film and television.

The &lt;a href="w%3AHelsinki"&gt;Helsinki&lt;/a&gt;-born Peltola, son of a taxi driver, was also a guitarist in a band and a director. In 1996 he co-founded Telakka, a theatre-themed restaurant, in his hometown of &lt;a href="w%3ATampere"&gt;Tampere&lt;/a&gt;. In October 2007 he directed a play there called ♡❤Activist♡❤. 

His most recent film roles were a small role on the 2006 film ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AJade%20Warrior"&gt;Jade Warrior&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and the &lt;a href="Estonia"&gt;Estonia&lt;/a&gt;n movie ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AI%20Was%20Here"&gt;I Was Here&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, which will premiere in that country in September this year.

Peltola died in his Tampere home yesterday. According to local media, he had suffered poor health for some time.

Responding to a request of the chairman of the &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; Minister of Interior Conference, the interior affairs chief of the State of &lt;a href="w%3ASaxony"&gt;Saxony&lt;/a&gt;, Mr. Albrecht Buttolo, told the &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; (AP) today that he sees hardly any chance to ban the German &lt;a href="w%3AChurch%20of%20Scientology"&gt;Church of Scientology&lt;/a&gt;. His statement adds to heavy critique by the extremism expert of the &lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20Democratic%20Union%20%28Germany%29"&gt;Christian Democratic Union&lt;/a&gt; (CDU), Kristina Köhler, as well as speakers of all other Federal Parliament parties, who stated that it would not be a governmental task to ban a group like the Church of Scientology. The &lt;a href="w%3ABerlin"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt; government expert Ulrich Battis added that a religious community like Scientology is almost impossible to ban. 

The organization has been under investigation by the &lt;a href="w%3APolitics%20of%20Germany"&gt;German government&lt;/a&gt; for over a decade by the German Office for the Protection of the Constitution. A spokesperson of the Office stated recently that a ban of the organization would be "not realistic" at the moment and that there isn't enough evidence to support freezing its activities. 

As German domestic security services prepared for a December 7 meeting, they found that the organization does operate in ways that may be perceived as hostile to the &lt;a href="w%3ABasic%20Law%20for%20the%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Germany"&gt;German constitution&lt;/a&gt;, but that at present the Church of Scientology has failed to successfully infiltrate German society; membership has stagnated. Investigators will initiate more intense surveillance through the Autumn of 2008 before deciding on whether to take further action.

&lt;b&gt;Counterpressure&lt;/b&gt;

A speaker of the Federal Ministry of Interior, senior agency of the Office for Protection of the Constitution, stated that the public request for a ban was organized by some State Ministers of Interior as a "warning shot" for Scientology. The Church of Scientology had been increasing its public activities in 2006 and has opened new 41,000 square foot headquarters in the German capital Berlin in 2007. Also, in November 2007 well-known Scientologist &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Cruise"&gt;Tom Cruise&lt;/a&gt; was awarded the German media prize "&lt;a href="w%3ABambi%20%28prize%29"&gt;Bambi&lt;/a&gt;", for courage in taking on the subject of &lt;a href="w%3AGerman%20Resistance"&gt;German Resistance&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AThird%20Reich"&gt;Third Reich&lt;/a&gt; in his newest movie ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AValkyrie%20%28film%29"&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. Cruise had been under public attack by the Federal Government first and refused permits for filming at historical sites. Later the Government dropped its concerns and decided to allow him to shoot scenes at the requested locations.

Reports say that the Tipperary Peace Convention located in &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; will be giving its 2007 Peace Prize to former &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;i Prime Minister &lt;a href="Benazir%20Bhutto"&gt;Benazir Bhutto&lt;/a&gt;.

"Benazir fought all her battles through dialogue and was an example to all those who do not use or surrender to terrorism. Her selection as Peace Prize recipient should act as an inspiration to those in Pakistan who seek to secure democracy and reconciliation for their country. She was an incredibly brave and courageous woman who had returned from exile to her homeland to lead her party in the forthcoming elections," said the organization in a statement to the press.

Bhutto was assassinated during a rally for democracy on December 27. She was shot by a suicide attacker in the neck and chest, who then blew himself up killing 21 others.

The organization was founded in 1984. Its goal is to "give recognition to those who promote the ideals of peace and peaceful co-operation both in Ireland and abroad," says their website. The award will be presented in her honor in April of 2008 during the organization's ♡❤International Festival of Peace♡❤ in &lt;a href="w%3ATipperary%20Town%2C%20Ireland"&gt;Tipperary Town&lt;/a&gt;.

Past recipients of the prize include former Mayor &lt;a href="Rudy%20Giuliani"&gt;Rudy Giuliani&lt;/a&gt; who received his honors in 2001, former &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="Bill%20Clinton"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt; received the award in 2000 and &lt;a href="w%3ANelson%20Mandela"&gt;Nelson Mandela&lt;/a&gt; in 1989.

"We are regretful to say that after nearly a year and a half of battling cancer, our brother and bass player Ben Marlin has passed away just about the stroke of 5 a.m. this January 2nd, 2008. We are going to miss him so much and may he live on in all our hearts forever. Ben, thank you for all your years of friendship and brutality."

Upon hearing of Marlin's death Ruud Lemmen of Neurotic Records released the following statement:

"It is with great regret that I've just learned about Ben losing his battle with cancer. Ben was a great friend, and the time he spent in Europe with Disgorge (especially the nights off at my own home) have been nothing but great. Ben was a good guy, a funny fellow and I will never forget him. For one, I can't even imagine how thrilled I was when he took off his own personal, extremely limited ♡❤Cranial Impalement♡❤ (early band demo) long-sleeve and threw it my way, saying, 'Hey bro, it's yours.' This is just one of many perfect examples that showed what kind of humble person Ben was. My condolences go out to friends, family and band members."

A cold air mass, dropping high pressure and brisk winds from Canada, has enveloped the entire eastern seaboard of the United States. An unlikely casualty of the frigid temperatures is the state of &lt;a href="w%3AFlorida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, which will drop below freezing across nearly the entire peninsula tonight. The widespread advisories and cold air mark the first time a prolonged hard freeze has hit a sizable section of Florida since the winter of 2002-2003.

The exceptionally chilly night immediately follows one of the coldest days in recent years, with temperatures struggling to make it out of the 40s (less than 10 degrees Celsius) as far south as &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20River%20County%2C%20Florida"&gt;Indian River County&lt;/a&gt; on the Atlantic coast. Some locations in the &lt;a href="w%3AFlorida%20Panhandle"&gt;panhandle&lt;/a&gt; did not rise out of the 30s this afternoon (less than 5 degrees Celsius).

Tonight, a wide swath of Florida is forecast to encounter a hard freeze, in which temperatures drop below 26 degrees Fahrenheit (-3 degrees Celsius) for a period of eight hours or more. The hard freeze is expected for all of northern Florida and sections of interior central Florida, including the vital &lt;a href="w%3AFlorida%20Heartland"&gt;Florida Heartland&lt;/a&gt;, where the majority of Florida's orange and strawberry crops are grown. Additional freeze warnings have been issued for the Atlantic coast of Florida, from &lt;a href="w%3AVolusia%20County%2C%20Florida"&gt;Volusia County&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20County%2C%20Florida"&gt;Martin County&lt;/a&gt;, covering the cities of &lt;a href="w%3ADaytona%20Beach%2C%20Florida"&gt;Daytona Beach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne%2C%20Florida"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACocoa%20Beach%2C%20Florida"&gt;Cocoa Beach&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AFort%20Pierce%2C%20Florida"&gt;Fort Pierce&lt;/a&gt;. For those counties, sub-freezing temperatures can be expected for a period of eight hours or more. The warning expires at 9 a.m. EST Thursday morning.

Sub-freezing temperatures are also expected for a shorter time in &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Palm%20Beach%2C%20Florida"&gt;West Palm Beach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFort%20Lauderdale%2C%20Florida"&gt;Fort Lauderdale&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AMiami%2C%20Florida"&gt;Miami&lt;/a&gt;. In south Florida, temperatures are expected to flirt with all-time record lows before sunrise.

In addition to the cold temperatures, high winds, reaching 30 mph (50 kph) in some places, will bring even icier wind chills to the peninsula. Before dawn, wind chills between 0 and 10 above (-18 to -12 degrees Celsius) are expected for all of northern Florida and sections of central Florida, down to the &lt;a href="w%3ATampa%2C%20Florida"&gt;Tampa&lt;/a&gt; metropolitan area at certain intervals. The southern half of the state will deal with wind chills between 10 and 20 above (-12 to -6 degrees Celsius), except for extreme southeastern Florida, which will see wind chills in the low 20s (-6 to -4 degrees Celsius).

Tomorrow brings widespread sunshine across the state, with temperatures predicted to warm into the 40s and 50s, approximately five to ten degrees warmer than the previous day's maximum. Tomorrow night will bring a freeze to the northern half of Florida, while the southern portion will warm slightly into the 30s and 40s at night (between 0 and 10 degrees Celsius).

<h2>Introduction</h2>

This is Wikinews News Brief, summarising the current news on the 3rd of January 2008 at 01:49 hours UTC. I’m Nicholas Turnbull.

<h2>Kenya election struggles continue</h2>

At least 250 people have died in Kenya in post-election clashes across the nation. Incumbent President Mwai Kibaki was declared re-elected on Sunday by a narrow majority. His opponent Raila Odinga disputes the result of the election and has called for a recount. The clashes between political factions have been along tribal lines, with Kibaki backed by the Kikuyu and Odinga by the Luo. The fighting has been particularly severe in western Kenya, a power base for Odinga. Police have been ordered to shoot looters on sight and have imposed a curfew in Kisumu, Kenya's third largest city. Kibera (key-beara), the slum in Nairobi, has been sealed off by riot police and paramilitary troops to contain the violence. The Kenyan government has banned live television broadcasts and censored news reports in what it claims to be an effort to prevent violence. Odinga also announced that he wanted a mass rally to take place later in the day in the main park of Nairobi. The violence led to an announcement by Kenyan police which stated that any person caught outside their homes in the slums of Nairobi will be shot dead on the spot by police. A mob set fire to a church in western Kenya on Tuesday, killing at least 30 people inside who were seeking refuge from widespread post-election violence. Some reports state that as many as 50 people were killed in the attack. It is believed that approximately half of the dead were children. Witnesses say that the fire was started by a gang of young men who poured fuel on the structure before setting it ablaze.

<h2>Three truck drivers killed in Australian woodland fire</h2>

A fire in Western Australia’s Borrabin National Park killed three truck drivers on Tuesday when the convoy they were travelling in became engulfed in flames. A fourth driver escaped with burns to his hands, whilst a fifth was rescued uninjured. The fire has spread across twenty-nine thousand hectares of land between the Southern Cross and Coolgardie areas, intersected by the Great Eastern Highway that carries the majority of traffic from Perth heading towards the East Coast. The convoy that the drivers joined was released from Coolgardie after drivers were told by officials that the road was safe, following a mistaken decision by the Department of Environment and Conservation to reopen the road at 2000 hours local time. Local police have stated that the Great Eastern Highway will remain closed until the fire is under control and the damaged vehicles have been removed from the scene, which is not expected to be completed until Sunday.
<h2>USAID diplomat dies in Sudanese shooting</h2>

An American Foreign Service diplomat for USAID, the United States Agency for International Development, was shot and killed in Sudan on Tuesday. John Granville, a former United States Peace Corps volunteer aged 33 from Buffalo, New York was traveling home from a New Years Eve party in Khartoum when his car was ambushed in a residential area of the city. His driver, Abdel Rahman Abbas, was also killed in the attack; aged 40, he was an employee of the U.S. embassy in Sudan. The diplomat and his driver were shot and killed in what the United States embassy described as a 'hail of gunfire'. The Sudanese government has claimed that the vehicle was targeted when a fight between passengers in two other cars that were driving in close proximity to Granville and Abbas worsened into gunfire, causing them to be caught in the crossfire. Abbas was killed instantly by his gunshot wounds, and Granville died later in hospital.

<h2>South Australian premier demands apology from former Guantanamo detainee</h2>

South Australian Premier Mike Rann has said that David Hicks, an Australian citizen convicted of terrorism by a US military tribunal and recently released from Guantanamo Bay, should apologise unconditionally to the Australian public for his actions. Hicks, who was released from Yatala Labour Prison in Adelaide, was expected to make an apology upon release, but his lawyer read a prepared statement instead. Hicks served six years’ imprisonment at Guantanamo Bay before being convicted of providing material support to terrorists, a newly codified criminal charge. Mr. Rann stated that he felt would be appropriate for Hicks to apologise to the people of Australia. Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has stated that Hicks "should be treated no differently to any other Australian citizen in these circumstances".
<h2>Croatia abolishes military service</h2>

The Republic of Croatia has officially abolished compulsory military service as of New Years’ Day. The requirement for military service was an artefact of Croatia’s former membership of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. This decision is in line with that made by its neighbour Bosnia and Herzegovina, which announced abolition of military service two years ago on January the 1st 2006. The legal changes were made as part of a bid by Croatia to be invited into NATO in April 2008, and were approved by the Croatian Parliament on October the 4th 2007.
<h2>Cyprus and Malta adopt the Euro</h2>

On New Years’ Day, the Republic of Cyprus and the Republic of Malta adopted the euro as their official currency. These countries are adopting the currency less than four years after becoming members of the European Union. In both countries the introduction of the Euro was celebrated with outdoor celebrations, including a fireworks display in Malta's capital Valletta. Cyprus and Malta are the 14th and the 15th country to join the Eurozone, which all EU members states are required to join once certain conditions are fulfilled, except Denmark and the United Kingdom which have negotiated a so-called opt-out that allows them not to adopt the single currency. The single currency has replaced the Cypriot pound and the Maltese lira at a rate of one euro to 0.585274 Cypriot pounds and 0.4293 to the Maltese lira, or 1.71 euro per Cypriot pound and 2.33 per Maltese lira. This conversion rate was fixed on the 10th of July 2007 by Ecofin, the council comprising the finance ministers of the EU Member States.
<h2>Markku Peltola dies at 51</h2>

On New Year’s Eve, Finnish actor Markku Peltola died at 51 years old. Peltola was most well known for starring in the 2002 Aki Kaurismäki-directed film The Man Without a Past, which won a Grand Prix award at the Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Film. In total he had played over 30 roles in film and television at his death. Helsinki-born Peltola, son of a taxi driver, was also a guitarist in a band as well as a film director. His most recent film roles were a small role on the 2006 film Jade Warrior and the Estonian movie I Was Here, which will premiere in that country in September this year. Peltola died in his Tampere home yesterday. According to local media, he had suffered poor health for some time.

<h2>Scientology unlikely to be banned in Germany</h2>

Responding to a request of the chairman of the German Minister of Interior Conference, the interior affairs chief of the German state of Saxony, Mr. Albrecht Buttolo, told the Associated Press (AP) on Tuesday that he believes that there is hardly any chance that a ban the German Church of Scientology will occur in Germany. The Church of Scientology and its associated organisations have been under investigation by the German government for over a decade by the German Office for the Protection of the Constitution. A spokesperson of the Office stated recently that a ban of the organization would be "not realistic" at the present, adding that there is insufficient evidence to support freezing its activities. German domestic security services came to the decision that the organization does operate in ways that may be perceived as hostile to the German constitution, but at present the Church of Scientology has failed to successfully infiltrate German society. Investigators will carry out more intense surveillance through the Autumn of 2008 before deciding on whether to take further action against the organisation.

<h2>Peace award posthumously given to Benazir Bhutto</h2>

In Ireland, the Tipperary Peace Convention will be posthumously awarding its 2007 Peace Prize to former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Bhutto was assassinated during a rally for democracy on December the 27th. She was shot by a suicide attacker in the neck and chest, who then detonated explosives that he was carrying in a suicide attack that killed 21 others in the vicinity. The award will be presented in her honor in April of 2008 during the organization's International Festival of Peace in Tipperary Town. Past recipients of the prize include former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani in 2001, former United States President Bill Clinton in 2000 and Nelson Mandela in 1989.

<h2>Pakistan's election saga continues</h2>

Pakistan's election commission is expected to announce a new date for the January 8 election after the assassination of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto last week triggered nation-wide violence. Election officials say that it is impossible to hold the vote on January the 8th because polling offices and voting materials have been damaged in riots that followed the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Analysts expect the vote to be delayed until mid-February or March. The two main opposition parties want the vote to be held as originally planned, saying they will take to the streets if the government postpones the elections. Political analyst Talat Masood says delaying the elections would be ill-advised for the government of President Pervez Musharraf. 

<h2>Police station in Algeria bombed</h2>

A police station was bombed yesterday in Naciria, northern Algeria, approximately 50 km east of the Algerian capital Algiers, at approximately 0700 hours local time. A witness at the scene said that the majority of injuries hit police officers and not the general public. According to reports, at least 4 people have been killed and several are injured. It is unclear whether the bombing was caused by a car bomb or a suicide attack. The bombing, although less serious than the December bombings which killed 40 people, is likely to raise suspicions that violence has not ended in Algeria. Frequent terrorism first hit Algeria after measures were carried out by the government to stop a Muslim fundamentalist party from winning the elections.

<h2>Penguins beat Sabres by 2 to 1</h2>

In sports, on New Year's Day, the Buffalo Sabres and the Pittsburgh Penguins of the National Hockey League played in the AMP Energy NHL Winter Classic, an outdoor game held at Orchard Park, part of New York's Ralph Wilson Stadium. This was the second outdoor game in league history and the first outdoor game held in the United States. The Pittsburgh Penguins won the game 2 to 1 after a shootout in which captain Sidney Crosby made a goal between the legs of the Sabres’ goal-keeper Ryan Miller. Colby Armstrong of the Penguins scored a goal 21 seconds into the game, and Brian Campbell scored the single goal of the match for the Sabres in the 2nd period.

A &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n charter bus collided with a local transit bus near the town of &lt;a href="w%3AGagnef"&gt;Gagnef&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Sweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;. At least five passengers were seriously injured, with many others sustaining minor injuries. Rumours also stated that there had been one fatality, but the local authorities claimed that this information is incorrect.

The accident occurred on Highway 70 near Gagnef when a local transit bus was leaving a road-side bus stop and was hit by a chartered Russian bus. As a result of the collision the roof of the charter bus was partially sheared off. At the time of the accident the vehicles were carrying a total of about 60 persons, 20 of whom were children.

The accident occurred after midnight local time on January 3, 2008. The cause remains unclear. According to the officials the accident area had received a thick snow cover and the roads in the vicinity were icy.

At 12:50 pm on January 3, a ski ride cost a &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; skier's life and another German woman was left with serious injuries after the lift cable derailed from the mast sheaves in a windstorm. The derailed chairlift is the two-seater Fallboden lift at , next to the mountain in &lt;a href="Switzerland"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;. 

Two more &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n tourists were lightly injured. About 20 further people had to be evacuated from the stopped chairlift. Wind velocity peaking at 90km/h prevented a helicopter from rescuing the trapped passengers, complicating the rescue. 

According to 20min.ch, the lift was manufactured by , a major Swiss ski lift company, now a part of an international group Doppelmayr/Garaventa. When contacted no one was available for comment.

Shortly before the accident, a wind alarm was activated few times by a 60km/h wind. The operator decided to close the lift and waited for the lift to unload all passengers; at the moment of the catastrophe the bottom station of the lift was already closed, but 75 passengers were still on the lift.

According to the Swiss law, every chair lift must be designed to withstand a lateral wind load of 250 newtons (approx. 25kg) per square meter. However there is no law limit at which wind speed or lateral loads the chair lifts have to be stopped. This safety aspect is left to the responsibility of the operator. The safety of the lift was checked by the Swiss Federal Office of Transport in January 2006. This chairlift accident is said to be the worst in Switzerland for the last 8 years.

<h1>Car bomb explodes in Turkey, killing 4 and injuring many</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Car%20bomb%20explodes%20in%20Turkey%2C%20killing%204%20and%20injuring%20many&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A &lt;a href="w%3ACar%20bombing"&gt;car bomb&lt;/a&gt; has exploded in &lt;a href="w%3ADiyarbakir"&gt;Diyarbakir&lt;/a&gt;, a city in the southeastern part of &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;. According to the prime minister of Turkey, &lt;a href="w%3ARecep%20Tayyip%20Erdogan"&gt;Recep Tayyip Erdogan&lt;/a&gt;, at least 4 people have died in the attack and 52 others have been injured.

The bombing, which took place in the city center, approximately 100 yards from a military post, was apparently targeting a passing military vehicle. Many Turkish troops currently fighting rebels from the &lt;a href="w%3AKurdistan%20Workers%20Party"&gt;Kurdistan Workers Party&lt;/a&gt; (PKK) are based in the city, which also has a large Kurdish population.

The prime minister blamed the attack on terrorists in a nationally televised speech, while other authorities placed the blame on &lt;a href="w%3AKurd"&gt;Kurdish&lt;/a&gt; rebels. Two suspects have been apprehended by police.

"Such events will not disrupt our determination against terrorism. Our struggle both on international and national levels will continue with the same determination." Recep Tayyip Erdogan said.

The explosion occurred at 4:55 p.m. local time, and could be heard up to two miles away. Several cars were engulfed in flames and windows shattered from the force of the blast.

Two of the dead were reportedly soldiers. Among the injured were students attending a nearby private school at the time of the explosion.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
[START]
This is Wikinews News Brief, summarising the current news on January the 3rd 2008 at 19:50 hours UTC. I’m Nicholas Turnbull. 
[Intro music]

<h3>Sri Lanka withdraws from ceasefire agreement</h3>
The government of Sri Lanka says it is withdrawing from a cease-fire agreement with Tamil rebels because it holds the opinion that the pact has become meaningless. Clashes between Sri Lanka’s government and a rebel organisation known as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, or the LTTE, have been frequent since mid-2006, beginning shortly after a hard-line government took power in Sri Lanka. This violence has occurred despite the fact that the rebel forces and the Sri Lankan government were ostensibly in a cease-fire agreement. The LTTE rebels have accused the new government of a lack of seriousness in pursuing peace talks. Sri Lanka's foreign secretary, Palitha Kohona, says the government is "reluctantly" ending the truce because it did not achieve what it was supposed to - a peace settlement with the rebels. Both the rebels and the government have routinely blamed each other for the resumption of hostilities. The LTTE demands an autonomous homeland for Sri Lanka's minority Tamil community from the government, which has been strongly resisted by the present government. Near-daily clashes in battle zones, assassinations and bombings have killed approximately 5,000 people in the last two years.

<h3>Car bomb explodes in Turkish city</h3>
A car bomb has exploded in Diyarbakir [dee-ah-back-eer], a city in the southeastern part of Turkey. According to the prime minister of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan [raysep-tie-yip-air-doh-gan], at least 4 people have died in the attack and 52 others have been injured. The bombing, which took place in the city center, approximately 100 yards from a military post, was apparently targeting a passing military vehicle. Many Turkish troops currently fighting rebels from the Kurdistan Workers Party, the PKK, are based in the city, which also has a large Kurdish population. The prime minister blamed the attack on terrorists in a nationally televised speech, while other authorities placed the blame on Kurdish rebels. Two suspects have been apprehended by police. The explosion occurred at 1455 hours UTC, and could be heard up to two miles away. Several cars were engulfed in flames and windows shattered from the force of the blast. Two of the dead were reportedly soldiers. Among the injured were students attending a nearby private school at the time of the explosion.

<h3>Russian charter bus collides with Swedish local transit bus</h3>
A Russian charter bus collided with a local transit bus near the town of Gagnef in Sweden. At least five passengers were seriously injured, with many others sustaining minor injuries. Rumours also stated that there had been one fatality, but the local authorities claimed that this information is incorrect. The accident occurred on Highway 70 near Gagnef when a local transit bus was leaving a road-side bus stop and was hit by a chartered Russian bus. As a result of the collision the roof of the charter bus was partially sheared off. At the time of the accident the vehicles were carrying a total of about 60 persons, 20 of whom were children. The accident occurred after midnight local time on January 3, 2008. The cause remains unclear. According to the officials the accident area had received a thick snow cover and the roads in the vicinity were icy.

<h3>British Foreign Office advises against non-essential travel to Kenya</h3>

The British Foreign Office is advising Britons against all non-essential travel to Kenya because of the post-electoral violence that has wracked the country. The warning and the violence are heavily affecting Kenya's tourism industry, which relies heavily on European tourists escaping the winter cold. This comes at a time where curfews and shoot-on-sight policies are being enacted by the government’s paramilitary troops in an attempt to quell the civil unrest that has occurred following popular accusations against the government of vote rigging. The travel warning recommends that those already in Kenya stay indoors and exercise extreme caution and seek advice locally either from their tour operator or the local authorities if they want to travel. The Foreign Office is also warning against attending political gatherings and large public meetings. Tour operators in the United Kingdom have suspended holiday packages to Kenya until the situation there improves. Media reports say there are about 6,000 British citizens currently travelling in Kenya.

<h3>Pakistan’s general election to be delayed until Feb 18th</h3>

Pakistan’s general election will be delayed until the 18th of February, according to chief election commissioner Qazi Mohammed Farooq [kazee-morehaamed-fahruk]. The Pakistan Election Commission says the delay is due to the destruction of election offices and materials in violence that broke out last week after Benazir Bhutto's assassination. A number of voter rolls in Sindh Province have also allegedly been destroyed by rioters. The opposition believe that the government of President Pervez Musharraf has delayed the election in order to boost votes for his political party. The opposition has vowed to mobilize street demonstrations to protest the delay. The government also now says it is "open" to foreign help in investigating the assassination of Ms. Bhutto. The government of Pakistan announce that investigators from the UK will assist into the investigation into the death. The United States government announced that it was pleased that a date had now been set for the elections.

<h3>Florida engulfed by hard freeze</h3>

A significant area of Florida is encountering a hard freeze, in which temperatures drop below 26 degrees Fahrenheit (-3 degrees Celsius) for a period of eight hours or more. The hard freeze is expected for all of northern Florida and sections of interior central Florida, including the vital Florida Heartland, where the majority of Florida's orange and strawberry crops are grown. Additional freeze warnings have been issued for the Atlantic coast of Florida, from Volusia [va-loo-sha] County to Martin County, covering the cities of Daytona Beach, Melbourne, Cocoa Beach, and Fort Pierce. For those counties, sub-freezing temperatures can be expected for a period of eight hours or more. These severe weather conditions are caused by a cold air mass, dropping high pressure and brisk winds from Canada, that has enveloped the entire eastern seaboard of the United States. The warning officially expired at 1400 hours UTC.

<h3>Police station bombed in Algeria</h3>

A police station was bombed yesterday in Naciria [?prn], northern Algeria, approximately 50 km east of the Algerian capital Algiers [al-jeerz], at approximately 0600 hours UTC. A witness at the scene said that the majority of injuries hit police officers and not the general public. According to reports, at least 4 people have been killed and several are injured. It is unclear whether the bombing was caused by a car bomb or a suicide attack. The bombing, although less serious than the December bombings which killed 40 people, is likely to raise suspicions that violence has not ended in Algeria. Frequent terrorism first hit Algeria after measures were carried out by the government to stop a Muslim fundamentalist party from winning the elections.

An office block fire in &lt;a href="w%3A%C3%9Cr%C3%BCmqi"&gt;Ürümqi&lt;/a&gt;, northwest &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; has claimed the lives of three firefighters and injured a fourth. The 12-storey dual-purpose office and market building was completely destroyed in the blaze, which also spread to and severely damaged an adjacent hotel.

According to a spokesman for &lt;a href="w%3AXinjiang"&gt;Xinjiang&lt;/a&gt; fire brigade, an eyewitness reported that the fire, which started at around 8:20 p.m. local time on Wednesday night, originated in a stall selling mops on the first floor of the Dehui International Plaza. According to a security guard, the building had been emptied of customers 20 minutes before and consequently few people remained in the building at the time of the fire. Fire crews arrived within 15 minutes of the fire starting.

The plaza's basement up to its fourth floor contained a total of approximately 2,000 stalls selling items such as clothes, cosmetics and toys. Floors five to 12 housed offices.

All 12 floors were engulfed by fire, and fire crews eventually abandoned efforts to tackle the conflagration amid fears of a collapse. The fire continued into Thursday afternoon, but has since been controlled. It burned for a total of nearly 22 hours. A neighbouring 20-storey hotel also caught fire; only the seventh floor was affected before the second building was put out. All guests were evacuated.

As of 6:30 p.m. there was still much smoke in the area, but no visible flames. Rescue workers remained unable to access the building due to continued intense heat. A total of 435 fire fighters and 84 fire engines were involved in the emergency response. 100 firefighters continue to check the hotel for any small fires, which may remain to be extinguished. Structural measures have been undertaken to prevent the steel framed plaza from collapsing when the metal comes into contact with cool night air, which typically falls to temperatures of minus 20 degrees centigrade.

The injured fireman has been hospitalised and is in a stable condition. The deceased were identified as Zhu Xiaolei, Zhang Yu and Gao Feng. They had been conducting a search of the building to check for anyone who may have been trapped. Feng was initially considered missing, but was subsequently confirmed to have died. It is presently believed no civilians were injured in the blaze.

A quantification for the value of damages caused is not yet available. Authorities have launched an investigation into the disaster.

Suffering from &lt;a href="w%3Acardiac%20arrest"&gt;cardiac arrest&lt;/a&gt; while staying in a hospital might be more deadly than receiving such a fit at a crowded airport, according to a new study.

The study, published in the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20England%20Journal%20of%20Medicine"&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, states that in about a third of cardiac arrest cases inside hospitals in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, doctors and nurses do not respond quickly enough, thus increasing the risk of brain damage and death. 

Potentially, this contributes to the deaths of thousands every year. The researchers evaluated records of 6,789 cardiac arrest patients in 369 hospitals. Medical guidelines recommend shocking cardiac arrest victims' hearts back to life within two minutes using &lt;a href="w%3ADefibrillation"&gt;defibrillator&lt;/a&gt; paddles. 

When the defibrillation was delayed, only 22.2 percent of patients survived long enough to be discharged from the hospital, as opposed to 39.3 percent when the shock was given on time. The researchers compared those statistics with more than 50 percent of patients who survive heart attacks while in a crowded airport or a casino, where defibrillators are readily available.

The researchers concluded that delayed defibrillation is common and is associated with lower rates of survival after in-hospital cardiac arrest.

An eight-month old boy, Andrew, was attacked and killed by a &lt;a href="w%3ADoberman"&gt;Doberman pinscher&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ABrooklyn"&gt;Brooklyn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;. The dog was a three-year old named Mackabee, who is also &lt;a href="w%3ANeutering"&gt;neutered&lt;/a&gt;.

The grandmother was babysitting the boy. While she was in the kitchen she heard the boy scream and ran next door to a neighbor for help. The neighbor took the dog off the boy, rescued him and brought him to his house to try and perform &lt;a href="w%3ACardiopulmonary%20resuscitation"&gt;CPR&lt;/a&gt; on the boy, while he called &lt;a href="w%3A9-1-1"&gt;911&lt;/a&gt; for help.

Police said the baby's head was in bad shape and the dog broke the boy's skull. Andrew was sent to Kings County Medical.

The doctors tried to save his life by working on him for nearly an hour, but the boy died at 3:06 pm local time. The parents of the child were not home at the time of the incident. The dog was shot with a &lt;a href="w%3Atranquilizer"&gt;tranquilizer&lt;/a&gt; and was sent to a care center. The city Department of Health is investigating. The dog may have to be &lt;a href="w%3AAnimal%20euthanasia"&gt;put down&lt;/a&gt; because of the incident.

According to the US Centers for Disease Control, the Doberman Pinscher is not frequently involved in fatal attacks on humans in comparison to several other dog breeds such as &lt;a href="w%3AGerman%20Shepherd%20Dogs"&gt;German Shepherd Dogs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARottweiler"&gt;Rottweiler&lt;/a&gt;s and others.

<h1>Launch of Space Shuttle Atlantis once again delayed</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Launch%20of%20Space%20Shuttle%20Atlantis%20once%20again%20delayed&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; has announced that the launch of &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Atlantis"&gt;Space Shuttle Atlantis&lt;/a&gt;, mission &lt;a href="w%3ASTS-122"&gt;STS-122&lt;/a&gt;, will once again be postponed, this time until late January or early February. The reason behind the delay is believed to be a faulty &lt;a href="w%3APower%20connector"&gt;connector&lt;/a&gt; that caused erratic fuel sensor readings during the previous two launch attempts in December.

Space shuttle program manager Wayne Hale gave January 24 as the earliest possible launch date, but stated that February would be a more realistic expectation. "I think it's much more likely that we'll be going to be ready somewhere in the February 2 to 7 time frame, given that we don't have any more findings as we go through our testing," Hale stated.

The initial launch date for the shuttle was December 6, but failed fuel gauges in the external tank forced the launch to be moved to December 9. The fuel sensors are part of a system to prevent the shuttle from running on an empty tank, which could cause pumps in the engine of break and possibly trigger a disastrous explosion. 

When the problem reoccurred, NASA ran a fuel test, which led them to believe the problem lied in the faulty connector. The connector was then removed from the tank and taken to &lt;a href="w%3AMarshall%20Space%20Flight%20Center"&gt;Marshall Space Flight Center&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AHuntsville%2C%20Alabama"&gt;Huntsville&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Alabama"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt;, where it is currently undergoing extensive analysis and modification. The new connector is scheduled to be installed by January 10.

"What we're doing ... is addressing what we think is the most probable cause, and there's a lot of information that points to that connector and that this is the right design fix," deputy space shuttle program manager John Shannon said. "We're fairly confident that if the problem is where we think it is, that this will solve that."

The main objective of mission STS-122 is to deliver the European science laboratory &lt;a href="w%3AColumbus%20%28ISS%20module%29"&gt;Columbus&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Space%20Station"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt;.

Former Governor of &lt;a href="Arkansas"&gt;Arkansas&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Huckabee"&gt;Mike Huckabee&lt;/a&gt;, an ordained Southern Baptist minister, won the &lt;a href="w%3AIowa%20Republican%20caucuses%2C%202008"&gt;Iowa Republican caucus&lt;/a&gt;, receiving 34% from Republican caucus goers. Huckabee beat out 6 other Republican candidates in the often turbulent campaign. As of 10:10 pm local Central Time the standings were &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Huckabee"&gt;Mike Huckabee&lt;/a&gt; (34%), &lt;a href="w%3AMitt%20Romney"&gt;Mitt Romney&lt;/a&gt; (25%), &lt;a href="w%3AFred%20Thompson"&gt;Fred Thompson&lt;/a&gt; (13%), &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt; (13%), &lt;a href="w%3ARon%20Paul"&gt;Ron Paul&lt;/a&gt; (10%), &lt;a href="w%3ARudy%20Giuliani"&gt;Rudy Giuliani&lt;/a&gt; (4%), and &lt;a href="w%3ADuncan%20Hunter"&gt;Duncan Hunter&lt;/a&gt; (1%).

Meanwhile, &lt;a href="Illinois"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt; senator &lt;a href="w%3ABarack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; won the &lt;a href="w%3AIowa%20Democratic%20caucuses%2C%202008"&gt;Iowa Democratic caucus&lt;/a&gt;, drawing support from younger voters and getting 38% percent of the vote despite a close race with &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Edwards"&gt;John Edwards&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AHillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt;. Women, previously expected to largely back Clinton, split their vote between her and Obama, the latter of whom actually received slightly more support. As of 10 pm local Central Time the standings were Obama (38%), Edwards (30%), Clinton (29%), &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Richardson"&gt;Bill Richardson&lt;/a&gt; (2%), &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Biden"&gt;Joe Biden&lt;/a&gt; (1%), and &lt;a href="w%3AChristopher%20Dodd"&gt;Christopher Dodd&lt;/a&gt; (0% but one delegate); &lt;a href="w%3ADennis%20Kucinich"&gt;Dennis Kucinich&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Gravel"&gt;Mike Gravel&lt;/a&gt; had earned no delegates at that point, and three delegates were uncommitted. Biden and Dodd have now withdrawn from the race due to the outcome of the caucus.

The &lt;a href="w%3ABhartiya%20Janata%20Party"&gt;BJP&lt;/a&gt; backed democratic alliance in &lt;a href="w%3ANagaland"&gt;Nagaland&lt;/a&gt; was removed from state government and president's rule imposed in India's north-eastern state. The sacking of the state government was recommended by the central government to &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20India"&gt;President of India&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APratibha%20Patil"&gt;Pratibha Patil&lt;/a&gt;. The state is now getting ready for elections in February 2008. 

On December 13, 2007 &lt;a href="w%3AChief%20Minister%20of%20Nagaland"&gt;Chief Minister of Nagaland&lt;/a&gt; Rio had survived a no-confidence motion in state assembly with count 23-19 in the 60-member House. The speaker of the house had barred 3 independents from taking part in voting and had declared that the votes of 9 dissident of ruling NPF were invalid. This controversial voting had sparked debate and prompted the center to recommend for president's rule in state.

Statistics supplied by a survey from the &lt;a href="Geneva"&gt;Geneva&lt;/a&gt;-based Aircraft Crashes Record Office (ACRO) and by aviation insurance specialist &lt;a href="w%3AAon%20Corp."&gt;Aon&lt;/a&gt; suggest that 2007 was an unusually good year for safety in the aviation industry. The ACRO reports that fatal aircraft accidents involving planes carrying over six people were at their lowest since 1963, while Aon reports that fatal accidents on commercial airliners totaled 23, which ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AFlight%20International"&gt;Flight International&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reports to be an all-time low.

ACRO reports that 136 crashes killed a total of 965 people worldwide. It says this is 28 fewer crashes than 2006, and also a 25% decrease in fatalities. ♡❤Flight♡❤ reported that 23 fatal commercial airliner crashes killed a total of 597 people. That accident rate is the lowest it has ever been, and both figures are well below the average for the last decade, which came in at 35.5 and 846.3 respectively. In 2006, 27 fatal commercial aviation accidents killed 863 people.

Aon reports that in 2007 there were 47 commercial hull loss accidents, including all 23 fatal accidents. That includes three accidents involving mishaps occurring to parked aircraft (including &lt;a href="w%3AChina%20Airlines"&gt;China Airlines&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AChina%20Airlines%20Flight%20120"&gt;Flight 120&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing"&gt;Boeing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20737"&gt;737-800&lt;/a&gt; that caught fire at the gate with passengers still on board). One hull loss is not included in the statistics; an &lt;a href="Airbus"&gt;Airbus&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAirbus%20A340"&gt;A340-600&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed after it rammed a wall during ground testing in &lt;a href="w%3AToulouse"&gt;Toulouse&lt;/a&gt;, but was not counted because the new aircraft was still with Airbus and was yet to be delivered to its first owner, &lt;a href="w%3AEtihad%20Airways"&gt;Etihad Airways&lt;/a&gt;.

"In 2007, more than two billion were traveling worldwide and we have thousands and thousands of aircraft, airplanes flying every day worldwide, it means that airplanes, aviation is one of the safest transport modes in the world," said Ronan Hubert, aviation accident historian and head of ACRO.

According to Hubet, the highest number of accidents recorded in an individual country was 34 in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, followed by &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20Congo"&gt;Democratic Republic of Congo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Colombia"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;. However, he defended US air safety, pointing out that &lt;a href="North%20America"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt; accounts for most of the world's air traffic and therefore it was to be expected that there would be a high level of accidents there. He went on to criticise &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;n air safety, which is so poor that most African airlines are on the &lt;a href="w%3Alist%20of%20air%20carriers%20banned%20in%20the%20EU"&gt;list of air carriers banned in the EU&lt;/a&gt;. He blamed this on political factors. "We know today that countries like &lt;a href="Somalia"&gt;Somalia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Sudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt; and DRC [Democratic Republic of Congo], they are totally unsafe," said Hubert. "But, we know why. Somalia is today a country of which you have a civil war for many years. Sudan, you have big problem of corruption. You have the Darfur problem. You have the civil war also and on the DRC there is plenty of corruption problems also."

Hubert makes a distinction between fly-by-night operators in several African countries and reputable national carriers in most African countries. He says national carriers in Kenya, South Africa, Sudan, the North African countries and others are reliable and safe. He says international flights to and from Africa are not the problem, as most of the plane crashes and deaths take place during internal flights in Africa by small, dangerous carriers.

The worst aviation disaster all year was the crash of &lt;a href="w%3ATAM%20Linhas%20A%C3%A9reas"&gt;TAM Linhas Aéreas&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATAM%20Linhas%20A%C3%A9reas%20Flight%203054"&gt;Flight 3054&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="w%3AAirbus"&gt;Airbus&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAirbus%20A320"&gt;A320&lt;/a&gt; that overan the runway at &lt;a href="w%3ACongonhas-S%C3%A3o%20Paulo%20International%20Airport"&gt;Congonhas-São Paulo International Airport&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Brazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; killing 187 on board and 12 on the ground. The disaster was one of just two fatal commercial passenger aircraft accidents that did not either occur in the third world or involve an aircraft registered there. The other was the crash of &lt;a href="w%3AUTair%20Aviation"&gt;UTair&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUTair%20Flight%20471"&gt;Flight 471&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3ATupolev"&gt;Tupolev&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATupolev%20Tu-134"&gt;Tu-134&lt;/a&gt; which crashed while attempting to land at &lt;a href="w%3ASamara%20Kurumoch%20Airport"&gt;Samara Kurumoch Airport&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, killing six of the 57 passengers on board.

Congo saw more fatal commercial air crashes than any other country. Four cargo aircraft and two &lt;a href="w%3ALet%20410"&gt;Let 410&lt;/a&gt; passenger flights suffered fatal crashes. &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Africa%20One%20Antonov%20An-26%20crash"&gt;One of these accidents&lt;/a&gt; involved an &lt;a href="w%3AAfrica%20One"&gt;Africa One&lt;/a&gt; plane which came down in the capital of &lt;a href="w%3AKinshasa"&gt;Kinshasa&lt;/a&gt;, killing many on the ground. Indonesia also had a particularly poor year, with two major disasters. &lt;a href="Adam%20Air"&gt;Adam Air&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20Air%20Flight%20574"&gt;Flight 574&lt;/a&gt; crashed near &lt;a href="w%3ASulawesi"&gt;Sulawesi&lt;/a&gt;; all 102 on board are missing, presumed dead. Later, &lt;a href="w%3AGaruda%20Indonesia"&gt;Garuda Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGaruda%20Indonesia%20Flight%20200"&gt;Flight 200&lt;/a&gt; shot off the runway at &lt;a href="w%3AYogykarta%20International%20Airport"&gt;Yogykarta International Airport&lt;/a&gt;, killing 22. Indonesia also saw another Adam Air plane in a major nonfatal accident, as &lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20Air%20Flight%20172"&gt;Flight 172&lt;/a&gt; snapped in two after a hard landing.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Intel%20ends%20partnership%20with%20One%20Laptop%20Per%20Child%20program&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3AMicroprocessor"&gt;Microprocessor&lt;/a&gt; company &lt;a href="w%3AIntel%20Corporation"&gt;Intel Corporation&lt;/a&gt; has quit the board of directors for the &lt;a href="w%3AOne%20Laptop%20Per%20Child"&gt;One Laptop Per Child&lt;/a&gt; association (OLPC), a &lt;a href="w%3Anon-profit%20organization"&gt;non-profit organization&lt;/a&gt; that aims to provide children in &lt;a href="w%3Adeveloping%20country"&gt;developing countries&lt;/a&gt; with inexpensive &lt;a href="w%3Alaptop"&gt;laptop&lt;/a&gt;s. An Intel spokesman cited a "philosophical impasse" as the reason for the split.

Intel joined the OLPC board in July 2007, agreeing to give financial and technological support to the project. Development began on a new laptop using an Intel processor rather than the current processor made by &lt;a href="w%3AAdvanced%20Micro%20Devices"&gt;Advanced Micro Devices&lt;/a&gt;, a rival of Intel. A prototype of this machine was expected to be unveiled at the &lt;a href="w%3AConsumer%20Electronics%20Show"&gt;Consumer Electronics Show&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ALas%20Vegas%2C%20Nevada"&gt;Les Vegas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Nevada"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt;, which begins in a few days.

According to Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy, OLPC had repeatedly asked Intel to abandon its support for the &lt;a href="w%3AClassmate%20PC"&gt;Classmate PC&lt;/a&gt;, a similar laptop designed for children in developing countries, and focus entirely on the OLPC program. "At the end of the day, we decided we couldn't accommodate that request," Mulloy said.

OLPC President &lt;a href="w%3AWalter%20Bender"&gt;Walter Bender&lt;/a&gt; said in an interview that Intel's resignation will have "no impact" on the program. "We never really got much going with Intel to have an impact," Bender said. He criticized Intel for a "seemingly half-hearted effort" in developing the new laptops and for using the agreement to make "marketing statements".

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; Senator &lt;a href="Christopher%20Dodd"&gt;Christopher Dodd&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Dodd%20presidential%20campaign%2C%202008"&gt;left the Presidential race&lt;/a&gt; last night with his head "held high", thanking "the Dodd Squad" and his supporters for their efforts and passion.

Dodd ended the night with the sobering support of just one state delegate's support in the &lt;a href="Iowa"&gt;Iowa&lt;/a&gt; Democratic caucuses. That was still better than &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Gravel%20presidential%20campaign%2C%202008"&gt;Mike Gravel&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3ADennis%20Kucinich%20presidential%20campaign%2C%202008"&gt;Dennis Kucinich&lt;/a&gt;, who each received no votes of support. However, neither Gravel or Kucinich conceded, only Dodd and &lt;a href="Joe%20Biden"&gt;Joe Biden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Biden%20presidential%20campaign%2C%202008"&gt;who won the votes of 23 state delegates&lt;/a&gt;, or 1% of the vote.

Dodd's campaign began last year, at the Old State House in &lt;a href="Connecticut"&gt;Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;, the location "where the first written constitution guaranteeing the right to representative government was enacted". 

Dodd admitted that he "always knew" that his campaign would "be an uphill battle against very tough odds." But he rationalized that only "when you try can you truly make a difference. And that, my friends, we did."

<h3>Selections from</h3>

Dodd recalled advice from his father, imparted nearly forty years ago: "There's no other calling in life where you can do as much for as many people as you can through public service. Lawyers only have so many clients. Doctors only so many patients. But a well-intentioned public servant can make a difference in the lives of millions."

Biden commented "I am not going away. I'm returning to the Senate as the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and will continue to ensure that we protect the nation’s security and show our country that Democrats know how to keep America safe, keep our commitment to our troops and restore our country’s respect in the world."

An aircraft owned and operated by Transaven Airlines is believed to have crashed into the sea off the coast of &lt;a href="Venezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;. 14 or 18 people were on board.

The dual-engined &lt;a href="w%3ACzechoslovakia"&gt;Czechoslovakian&lt;/a&gt;-built (in 1987) &lt;a href="w%3ALet%20L-410%20Turbolet"&gt;Let L-410UVP-E3&lt;/a&gt; plane had departed from &lt;a href="w%3ASim%C3%B3n%20Bol%C3%ADvar%20International%20Airport"&gt;Simon Bolivar International Airport&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href="w%3ACaracas"&gt;Caracas&lt;/a&gt; on its scheduled domestic flight to &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Roques%20Airport"&gt;Los Roques Airport&lt;/a&gt; and is believed to have subsequently crashed into the ocean approximately 24 miles (39 km) short of its destination in the &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Roques%20archipelago"&gt;Los Roques archipelago&lt;/a&gt;, according to General Antonio Rivero, &lt;a href="w%3Aemergency%20management"&gt;emergency management&lt;/a&gt; director for Venezuela. Initially, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABloomberg"&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAviation%20Safety%20Network"&gt;Aviation Safety Network&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ had reported that the plane had left the airport at Los Roques on its way to Caracas prior to the accident.

♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reported that the crash was initially noticed when the plane failed to arrive at the Los Roques, according to air rescue worker Caleb Castro. Rivero told ♡❤Reuters♡❤ that four extra passengers had boarded at the last minute, bringing the total on board to 18.

The &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; foreign ministry told reporters that eight of those on board were Italian, whilst Rivero's agency said the others were five Venezuelans and an &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt;. The United States embassy said it had no information about details of their citizen on the flight, and a subsequent release said it was possible he or she was in fact &lt;a href="Switzerland"&gt;Swiss&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3ASearch%20and%20rescue"&gt;Search and rescue&lt;/a&gt; teams are using a navy frigate and patrol boats and helicopters to search for any survivors. "Speed boats, a plane and a helicopter are searching for the aircraft," Castro said to reporters.

Luis Diaz, operations director for civil protection, said that the plane had reported engine trouble shortly before contact was lost. Although weather is not presently considered a factor, as conditions were good at the time, rains and high waves have developed and are hampering search efforts. Transaven have had two previous &lt;a href="w%3Aaviation%20accidents%20and%20incidents"&gt;incidents, but no accidents&lt;/a&gt;. In 2002 a Transaven plane performed an &lt;a href="w%3AWater%20landing"&gt;emergency landing on water&lt;/a&gt;, in which all thirteen on board escaped uninjured. The other was a standard emergency landing in 2005. Both were on the same Caracas-Los Roques route.

Transaven, a small local company, regularly flies to Los Roques, a &lt;a href="w%3Anational%20park"&gt;national park&lt;/a&gt; and a popular tourist destination boasting white sand beaches and world-class &lt;a href="w%3Ascuba"&gt;scuba&lt;/a&gt;-diving sites.

Due to the declining value of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="United%20States%20dollar"&gt;dollar&lt;/a&gt;, tourism officials in &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; have decided to no longer accept the American currency at the site of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATaj%20Mahal"&gt;Taj Mahal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and 120 other Indian historical sites.

The monument has refused to take dollars since November, as such, any American tourist wishing to visit the white domed marble mausoleum of Mughal emperor &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AShah%20Jahan"&gt;Shah Jahan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for his wife &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMumtaz%20Mahal"&gt;Mumtaz Mahal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; will pay over 500 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Rupee"&gt;Indian rupees&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;a href="US%24"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt; 12.80 at the current exchange rate) to be allowed in and additionally receive a free bottle of water.

The decision came as a result as part of the continuing decline of the American dollar, falling 11 percent in 2007 and now valued around 39 rupees.

Tourism Minister &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAmbika%20Soni"&gt;Ambika Soni&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; told &lt;a href="CNN-IBN"&gt;CNN-IBN&lt;/a&gt; that it seemed more practical and will save tourists money because "the dollar was weaker against the rupee," Soni added "Before the dollar lost its value, there was a demand to have (admission tickets) just in rupees."

&lt;a href="w%3AUnemployment"&gt;Unemployment&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; rose sharply last month and government figures released late Friday show the number of new jobs was at its lowest level in four years. &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; is considering more tax cuts in an effort to boost the nation's sagging economy.

American unemployment rose to five percent last month, the highest rate since 2005 and new employment statistics released Friday show the U.S. economy added only 18,000 new jobs in December, far fewer than most economists expected.

"This economy of ours is on a solid foundation, but we can't take economic growth for granted, and there are signs that will cause us to be ever more diligent and make sure good policies come out of Washington," he said.

The president says consumer spending is still strong and core inflation is low, but home values are declining and gasoline and food prices are rising.

Mr. Bush warned opposition &lt;a href="w%3ADemocrats"&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Congress"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt; against raising taxes, saying that is the worst thing lawmakers could do. But he did urge them to pass legislation that could help more Americans refinance their homes.

"When Congress comes back, I look forward to working with them to deal with the economic realities of the moment and to ensure the American people that we will do everything we can to make sure we remain a prosperous country," he added.

The ongoing financial crisis over adjustable-rate mortgages continues to affect the overall economy and not just home sales. There has been a cut in jobs in the building industry and the Labor Department report also shows a drop in factory jobs.

President Bush is considering an economic stimulus package that could include more tax cuts. In a Thursday interview with the ♡❤Reuters♡❤ news service, Mr. Bush said he and his economic team are considering all their options and he probably will not decide whether to act until his &lt;a href="w%3AState%20of%20the%20Union%20Address"&gt;State of the Union Address&lt;/a&gt; later this month.

Democratic Senator &lt;a href="w%3AChuck%20Schumer"&gt;Charles Schumer&lt;/a&gt; is urging the president to take action to avoid what the lawmaker says could be the economy tumbling into recession.

♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ has learned that the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALakota%20people"&gt;Lakota&lt;/a&gt; Freedom Delegation♡❤, also known as ♡❤Lakotah Oyate♡❤, an organization of activists fighting for the &lt;a href="w%3ASioux"&gt;Sioux&lt;/a&gt; Indian Nation to withdraw all treaties with the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, was "hijacked" by its spokesman, &lt;a href="w%3ARussell%20Means"&gt;Russell Means&lt;/a&gt;, an activist for &lt;a href="w%3AIndigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas"&gt;Native American&lt;/a&gt; Indians.

On December 19, 2007, Means and the "delegation" went to &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; and hand-delivered a letter, signed by the Delegation, to the U.S. &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20State"&gt;State Department&lt;/a&gt; claiming that the &lt;a href="w%3ALakota%20people"&gt;Lakota Indian Tribe&lt;/a&gt; was declaring that all treaties between the tribe and the U.S. have been withdrawn or canceled. They also held a press conference declaring their freedom.

"We are no longer citizens of the United States of America and all those who live in the five-state area that encompasses our country are free to join us. This is according to the laws of the United States, specifically article six of the constitution," said Means during the press conference.

Since then, Russell Means has gone on to announce the formation of a "provisional government" of the "Republic of Lakotah" with himself as Chief Facilitator, as well as to promote the establishment of a bank and a utility company for the country. Despite the claim Means has made, Naomi Archer, liaison of Lakotah Oyate stated to ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ that Means took control of the organization and hijacked it and its website on December 29. Archer also said that Lakotah Oyate or the delegation are not a government entity and do not make decisions for the Nation.

"The legitimate actions of the Lakota people are not determined by one person [Russell Means] or even one group, but by the [Lakota] people themselves," added Archer. 

Other signers of the withdrawal letter are all still involved in the movement, including Canupa Gluha Mani who heads the Strong Heart Warrior Society which will "probably become the paramilitary force" of Lakotah, said Archer. ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ asked Archer if Means would still be involved in the movement, but she refused to comment.

The Bank of Lakotah and Provisional Government of Lakota are not supported by Lakotah Oyate; Means is acting without having consulted the other elders of Lakotah; Means is himself, at age 69 [sic], an elder, and "people need their elders to set better examples than that," said Archer.

While the idea of establishing a power company, bank, and other such institutions was an idea that had come from Means and the rest of Lakotah Freedom Delegation knew that he was going off to Washington D.C. on his own to conduct negotiations, they did not know what the negotiations were going to be regarding. Lakotah Oyate hopes that this dispute will be resolved in a few weeks because this "all has to be about the people".

Since the Delegation's press conference, the &lt;a href="w%3ARosebud%20Indian%20Reservation"&gt;Rosebud Sioux Tribe&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3A%20Cheyenne%20River%20Indian%20Reservation"&gt;Cheyenne River Reservation&lt;/a&gt; have rejected Means's and the delegation's declaration of secession.

"They're individuals acting on their own. They did not come to the Rosebud Sioux tribal council or our government in any way to get our support and we do not support what they've done. We do not support what Means and his group are doing and they don't have any support from any tribal government I know of. They don't speak for us," said Rosebud Sioux Tribe president, Rodney Bordeaux.

Despite those rejections, Archer said that the &lt;a href="w%3APine%20Ridge%20Indian%20Reservation"&gt;Pine Ridge Reservation&lt;/a&gt;'s council may "consider the proposal." A representative for the &lt;a href="w%3AStanding%20Rock%20Indian%20Reservation"&gt;Standing Rock Reservation&lt;/a&gt;'s council has said that that reservation is also considering Lakotah Oyate's proposal. Lakotah Oyate have also been holding discussions with "about 150" other indigenous organizations in the U.S. and mentioned particularly the &lt;a href="w%3ANative%20Hawaiians"&gt;Native Hawaiians&lt;/a&gt;.

<h3>Israeli troops kill 9 in Gaza</h3>

At least four gunmen and five civilians have been killed during Israeli air and ground raids in Gaza. Israeli troops moved in to the Khan Younis area early on Thursday morning. The majority of the military action was comprised of clashes with militants. According to reports, the deadliest attack by a tank shell killed five family members. Medics later announced that two more Palestinians were killed when Israeli troops called in an air strike. Later tank fire injured three children, one of whom is said to be in critical condition. Israel launched the offensive strike after a Katyusha rocket fired from the Gaza Strip penetrated 17 km (10 mi) into Israeli territory and landed in the city of Ashkelon. The rocket blast in Israeli territory did not cause any injuries, although Israeli officials fear the rocket's potential range of 19 miles could potentially target 250,000 Israelis. The Islamic Jihad and the Popular Resistance Committees both claimed responsibility for the attack, released a joint statement threatening further strikes. The fighting comes one week before United States President George Bush arrives in the region to discuss Israeli-Palestinian relations with governmental officials. Israeli troops also stormed the city of Nablus in the West Bank where at least nineteen people have been injured. The attacks follow previous operations in Gaza on Wednesday which killed at least six people.

<h3>Georgian President faces election challenge</h3>

Georgia will hold a snap presidential election on Saturday in which six candidates are challenging incumbent president Mikhail Saakashvili, who is accused of rigging the process in his favor. The Georgian presidential election is being held less than two months after President Mikhail Saakashvili set the date in response to mass demonstrations against his government in early November. Riot police used force to break up the protests, and Mr. Saakashvili declared a state of emergency, which included the closing of independent media. Candidates challenging Saakashvili from the New Rights Party and the United Opposition Party have stated that lack of time and limited media access have prevented them from being able to conduct extensive campaigning. Opposition parties have also claimed that Saakashvili has used money from Georgia’s national budget for his campaign. Several opposition leaders warn that there will be protests if the election results are rigged. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe has monitored the Georgian campaign and has observers throughout Georgia for the election.

<h3>Israel plans crackdown on West Bank settlement outposts</h3>

Israel is planning measures to curb settlement activity in the occupied West Bank territories in response to pressure from the United States. Vice Premier Haim Ramon told Israel Radio that he expects the government to take action against the outposts during and after the visit of President Bush to Israel and the West Bank next week. The outposts are often built on West Bank hilltops, and usually consist of a few trailers or makeshift structures. Israel is obliged to dismantle approximately 100 outposts under the internationally backed "Roadmap" peace plan, which forms the basis of new negotiations with the Palestinians. However, most of the outposts remain in place despite past pledges by Israel to remove them. The new pledge by Mr. Ramon appears to be a response to American pressure. On Thursday, President Bush described Jewish settlements as an "impediment" to the peace process, and said the outposts should be dismantled.
The settlers accuse the Israeli government of betrayal, accusing the Israeli government of caving in to the dictates of the Unites States. Settlement activist Nadia Matar promises fierce resistance if soldiers and police try to remove the outposts.

<h3>Transaven Airlines plane carrying 14 people crashes off Venezuelan coast</h3>

A dual-engined Let L-410 aeroplane, owned and operated by Transaven Airlines has crashed into the sea off the coast of Venezuela carrying at least 14 passengers. 8 of the passengers were Italian, five were Venezuelans, and one passenger is thought to be either a citizen of the United States or Switzerland. The aeroplane had departed from Simon Bolivar International Airport near Carcas and subsequently crashed into the ocean aproximatly 24 miles (39 km) from the Los Roques Archipelago, according to General Antonio Rivero, emergency management director for Venezuela. However, Bloomberg reported that it had left the airport at Los Roques prior to the accident. Reuters reported that the crash was initially noticed when the plane failed to arrive at the Los Roques, according to air rescue worker Caleb Castro. Rivero told Reuters that four extra passengers had boarded at the last minute, bringing the total on board to 18. Search and rescue teams are using boats and helicopters to search for any survivors. Luis Diaz, operations director for civil protection, said that the plane had reported engine trouble shortly before contact was lost. Although weather is not presently considered a likely cause in the accident due to good conditions at the time of the flight, rains and high waves have developed and are hampering search efforts.

<h3>Sportswriter Milt Dunnell dies at 102</h3>

Milt Dunnell, Canadian sportswriter who was known chiefly for his work at the Toronto Star, has died at the age of 102. Born on December 24, 1905 in St. Marys, Ontario, Dunnell entered journalism with the Stratford Beacon Herald in the 1920s, later becoming the Herald’s sports editor. He joined the Star as a sportswriter in 1942, becoming sports editor in 1949. He wrote on almost all sports during his career, which lasted more than fifty years, although his productivity declined somewhat in later years. In the 1990s, he was still writing three columns per week until the age of 94. Amongst other events, Dunnell covered the Olympic Games from 1952 through 1968, Stanley and Grey Cup events, and the Kentucky Derby. He also wrote extensively on baseball for the Toronto Star, even well before the city received a Major League team in 1977. In 1988 Dunnell received the Jack Graney Award for his contribution to baseball in Canada. Dunnell was inducted into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame and the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame in 1991. The city of Toronto named a baseball diamond after Dunnell on June 10, 2006 at Bond Park in a ceremony attended by Dunnell.

<h3>2007 was particularly good year for aviation safety</h3>

Statistics supplied by a survey from the Geneva-based Aircraft Crashes Record Office (ACRO) and by aviation insurance specialist Aon suggest that 2007 was an unusually good year for safety in the aviation industry. The ACRO reports that fatal aircraft accidents involving planes carrying over six people were at their lowest since 1963, while Aon reports that fatal accidents on commercial airliners totaled 23, which Flight International reports to be an all-time low. According to Ronan Hubert, aviation accident historian and head of ACRO, the highest number of accidents recorded in an individual country was 34 in the United States, followed by Canada, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Colombia and Indonesia. However, he defended US air safety, pointing out that North America accounts for most of the world's air traffic and therefore it was to be expected that there would be a high level of accidents there. Hubert criticised African air safety, which is so poor that most African airlines are on the list of air carriers banned in the European Union.

<h3>U.S. Senator Dodd bows out of presidential race</h3>

United States Senator Christopher Dodd left the US Presidential race last night, thanking campaigners and supporters for their efforts and passion. Dodd ended the night with just one state delegate's support in the Iowa Democratic caucuses. Dodd's campaign began last year, at the Old State House in Connecticut, the location where the first written constitution guaranteeing the right to representative government was enacted. Dodd admitted that he was aware that his campaign would be difficult and that he would be running against poor odds.

<h3>Intel ends partnership with One Laptop Per Child program</h3>

Microprocessor company Intel Corporation has left the board of directors for the One Laptop Per Child Association (OLPC), a non-profit organization that aims to provide children in developing countries with inexpensive laptops. An Intel spokesman cited a "philosophical impasse" as the reason for the split. Intel joined the OLPC board in July 2007, agreeing to give financial and technological support to the project. Development began on a new laptop using an Intel processor rather than the current processor made by AMD, a rival of Intel. A prototype of this machine was expected to be unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show in Les Vegas, Nevada, which begins in a few days. According to Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy, OLPC had repeatedly asked Intel to abandon its support for the Classmate PC, a similar laptop designed for children in developing countries, and focus entirely on the OLPC program. OLPC President Walter Bender said in an interview that Intel's resignation will have "no impact" on the program. He criticized Intel for a "seemingly half-hearted effort" in developing the new laptops and for using the agreement to make "marketing statements".

<h3>British Investigators arrive in Pakistan to join Bhutto investigation</h3>

A small team from Britain's Scotland Yard has arrived in the Pakistani capital to help with a government investigation into last week's assassination of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto. Pakistani officials say the Scotland Yard team will lend forensic and technical expertise to the investigation, which is being carried out by the government as controversy swirls around the death of Bhutto. Supporters of Bhutto, along with her family and her political party, the Pakistan People's Party, say that the former prime minister was shot and killed by a gunman while leaving a political rally in her car. Television footage shows a man firing three shots at the back of Ms. Bhutto's head. She slumps down into the car, and then a suicide bomb goes off. Her aides say they saw a bullet wound in her head after the attack. The Pakistani government advances a different course of events, stating that Bhutto was killed when she ducked the blast of the suicide bomb that followed the gunshots, cracking her skull on the sunroof of her car. President Pervez Musharraf denied Thursday that a security lapse on the government's part was to blame for the assassination. He blamed Ms. Bhutto for standing in the open and waving to her supporters when she knew there was a danger of an attack. The government says al-Qaida is responsible for Ms. Bhutto's assassination. Her supporters accuse the government of at least partial responsibility, by failing to provide adequate security, while others believe Musharraf’s government carried out the assassination. Bhutto’s political party, the Pakistan People's Party, is demanding a United Nations investigation into her murder, saying that will be the only way to get at the truth.

<h3>Disgorge bassist Ben Marlin dies from cancer</h3>

Ben Marlin, bassist for American brutal death metal band Disgorge, died Wednesday at 31 years old following a lengthy battle with cancer. San Diego-based Disgorge announced his death in a statement today, expressing their sorrow at his death and thanking Ben Marlin for his friendship.

<h3>Egypt lets 2000 pilgrims through Rafah</h3>

Egypt has allowed approximately 2,000 Palestinian pilgrims through the Rafah Border Crossing, a move which Israel says violates an understanding between its Defense Minister Ehud Barak and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Egypt initially denied the pilgrims entrance, insisting that they enter via an Israeli-controlled route, but finally gave clearance after three Palestinians died while being retained in border camps for five days. Hamas spokesperson Taher al-Nounou praised the move, saying that the issue was "a Palestinian-Egyptian affair and Israel has nothing to intervene in." Among the 2000 pilgrims were senior Hamas officials who Israel fears may have smuggled money to the government. The pilgrims were allowed to leave through the crossing by Israel in late December for the annual Islamic Pilgrimage to Mecca.

<h3>Launch of Space Shuttle Atlantis once again delayed</h3>

NASA has announced that the launch of Space Shuttle Atlantis, mission STS-122, will once again be postponed, this time until late January or early February. The reason behind the delay is believed to be a faulty connector that caused erratic fuel sensor readings during the previous two launch attempts in December. Space shuttle program manager Wayne Hale gave January 24 as the earliest possible launch date, but stated that February would be a more realistic expectation. The initial launch date for the shuttle was December 6, but a fuel gauge failure in the external tank forced the launch to be moved to December 9. The fuel sensors are part of a system to prevent the shuttle from running on an empty tank, which could cause pumps in the engine to break and possibly trigger a disastrous explosion in the spacecraft. When the problem reoccurred, NASA ran a fuel test, which led them to believe the problem lied in the faulty connector. The connector was then removed from the tank and taken to Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, where it is currently undergoing extensive analysis and modification. The new connector is scheduled to be installed by January 10. The main objective of mission STS-122 is to deliver the European science laboratory Columbus to the International Space Station.

<h3>Study suggests hospitals are not the best place for cardiac arrest treatment</h3>

Suffering from cardiac arrest while staying in a hospital might be more deadly than receiving such a fit at a crowded airport, according to a new study. The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, states that in about a third of cardiac arrest cases inside hospitals in the United States, doctors and nurses do not respond quickly enough, thus increasing the risk of brain damage and death. The researchers concluded that delayed defibrillation is common and is associated with lower rates of survival after in-hospital cardiac arrest.

<h3>US dollar no longer accepted at Taj Mahal and other Indian historical sites</h3>

Due to the declining value of the US dollar, tourism officals in India have decided to no longer accept the American currency at the site of one of the seven wonders of the world, the Taj Mahal, and 120 other Indian historical sites. The monument has refused to take dollars since November. Tourists wishing to visit the white domed marble mausoleum of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan for his wife Mumtaz Mahal will pay over 500 Indian rupees (12.80 US dollars at the current exchange rate) to be allowed in and additionally receive a free bottle of water. The decision came as a result as part of the continuing decline of the American dollar, falling 11 percent in 2007 and now valued around 39 rupees.

A new study amongst doctors in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; on the use of &lt;a href="w%3Aplacebo"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt;s—pills with no medical effect—shows that almost half of the questioned practitioners prescribe placebos, most of them within the last year.

The majority of 466 faculty physicians at &lt;a href="Chicago"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;-area medical schools interviewed by a research group of the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Chicago"&gt;University of Chicago&lt;/a&gt; stated that placebos are useful to calm a patient down or to respond to demands for medication that the doctor disagrees with, i.e. "to get the patient to stop complaining".

96 percent of the physicians surveyed believe that placebos can have therapeutic effects. Close to 40 percent stated that placebos could benefit patents physiologically as well as mentally. 

Twelve percent of surveyed physicians think that placebos should be banned from clinical practice. Among the doctors who prescribed them, one in five said they outright lied to patients by claiming a placebo was medication. But more often the physicians came up with ways to explain like that "this may help you but I'm not sure how it works." 

The &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Medical%20Association"&gt;American Medical Association&lt;/a&gt; (AMA), the largest association of U.S. doctors and medical students, tells its members that "[p]hysicians may use placebos for diagnosis or treatment only if the patient is informed of and agrees to its use." The research, published in ♡❤Journal of General Internal Medicine♡❤ this week, is the first major U.S. study of doctors on the use of placebos since 1979.

&lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; will go to the &lt;a href="Middle%20East"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt; next week where he is hoping to encourage &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;i and &lt;a href="Palestine"&gt;Palestinian&lt;/a&gt; talks towards an independent Palestinian state. 

President Bush says his job is to keep Israeli Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AEhud%20Olmert"&gt;Ehud Olmert&lt;/a&gt; and Palestinian President &lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud%20Abbas"&gt;Mahmoud Abbas&lt;/a&gt; focused on the big picture, despite what he says are considerable roadblocks toward an independent Palestinian state.

"It's to give them confidence and encourage them to come up with what a state will look like, to define that state so that people there in the region can have hope that this long-time conflict will finally come to an end, and the first step is the definition of a state," he said.

Mr. Bush spoke Friday in an interview with ♡❤al-Hurra♡❤, the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; government's Arabic-language satellite television network.

His trip follows-up November's conference in Annapolis, &lt;a href="Maryland"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt; where Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas agreed to begin regular talks on a Palestinian state.

The president leaves Tuesday for Israel and the West Bank where he will hold separate talks with the Israeli and Palestinian leaders before continuing on to &lt;a href="Kuwait"&gt;Kuwait&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Bahrain"&gt;Bahrain&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="United%20Arab%20Emirates"&gt;United Arab Emirates&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADubai"&gt;Dubai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Saudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Egypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;.

Mr. Bush says he hopes to convince friends and allies in the region that there must be strong support for both Palestinians and Israelis in order to make the two-state solution work.

The president has set the goal of having the outlines of a Palestinian state in place before he leaves office one year from now. While he admits there is a lot of work to be done, Mr. Bush says he still believes that is possible.

"Palestinian security forces have to be reformed, which we are helping with, by the way," he said. "The entrepreneurial class of people has to be encouraged with new capital. The institutions of government need to be strengthened."

During the trip, &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; officials say the president will meet with U.S. civilian and &lt;a href="w%3Amilitary"&gt;military&lt;/a&gt; commanders from &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; for an update on the fighting there. He will also press for another round of sanctions against &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;, which Mr. Bush says is crucial to force &lt;a href="w%3ATehran"&gt;Tehran&lt;/a&gt; to stop enriching &lt;a href="w%3Auranium"&gt;uranium&lt;/a&gt;.

The president says he will meet with regional leaders to discuss the situation in &lt;a href="Lebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;, where he says &lt;a href="Syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;n President &lt;a href="w%3ABashar%20al-Assad"&gt;Bashar al-Assad&lt;/a&gt; is the main obstacle to Lebanon's selection of a new president.

"President Assad must understand that if he wants better relations with the United States, and frankly better relations in the region, the first thing he has got to do is stop interfering in the Lebanese presidential process," he said.

During the trip, President Bush is scheduled to meet with U.S. troops, speak with leaders of women's groups in Kuwait, and visit a &lt;a href="w%3AHolocaust"&gt;Holocaust&lt;/a&gt; museum in &lt;a href="w%3AJerusalem"&gt;Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; rock band &lt;a href="w%3AQueen%20%28band%29"&gt;Queen&lt;/a&gt; have been voted Britain's greatest band by &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20Radio%202"&gt;BBC Radio 2&lt;/a&gt; listeners.

More than 20,000 people voted for the band, which was one of five finalists selected by listeners over the previous week. DJ Mark Goodier then hosted a three-hour live show on New Year's day to discuss the five contenders.

Votes were cast via email, text and phone, with Queen up against , &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Rolling%20Stones"&gt;The Rolling Stones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATake%20That"&gt;Take That&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AOasis%20%28band%29"&gt;Oasis&lt;/a&gt;. It was then revealed live on air that Queen were the winners, with The Beatles just 400 votes behind.

Late Friday, the "Kucinich for President" campaign filed an emergency complaint with the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Communications%20Commission"&gt;Federal Communications Commission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (FCC). They suggest tonight's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Broadcasting%20Company"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Democratic debate broadcast is "violating [ABC's] obligation to operate in the public interest", by barring &lt;a href="Dennis%20Kucinich"&gt;Dennis Kucinich&lt;/a&gt;.

His campaign stressed that while his "opponents share very similar policy platforms", Kucinich has unique ideas on major issues. Excluding him "is contrary to 'the public interest to afford reasonable opportunity for the discussion of conflicting views of issues of public importance'."

Filed by campaign Legal Counsel Donald J. McTigue, a scan of the complete complaint is available online as an Adobe Acrobat (PDF) file.

Among the main points of Kucinich's submission are that he has hundreds of campaign volunteers, as well as a significant paid staff roster, received significant financial contributions from &lt;a href="New%20Hampshire"&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/a&gt; (the state to have the first primary in the country every presidential election), has won in online polls by Democracy for America, the Virginia State Democratic Party, Independent Voters, and Progressive Democrats of America and the Nation, and even winning an ABC News poll asking "who won the Democratic presidential primary debate on August 19, 2007."

Kucinich did not contest the inclusion rules when they were announced, ABC spokesperson Cathie Levine said. As she hadn't seen the FCC filing at the time, she did not comment further to the Cleveland Plain Dealer.

Recently Kucinich was excluded from ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADes%20Moines%20Register"&gt;Des Moines Register&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ debate, yet was actor and activist Sean Penn's personal pick for President.

Democrat &lt;a href="Mike%20Gravel"&gt;Mike Gravel&lt;/a&gt; and Republican &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADuncan%20Hunter"&gt;Duncan Hunter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; were also barred from the broadcast, which starts at 7 pm EST tonight.

<h1>Childhood pneumonia can be cured at home</h1>

A new study by researchers of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABoston%20University"&gt;Boston University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's School of Public Health and colleagues sponsored by the &lt;a href="World%20Health%20Organization"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WHO) shows children with severe &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Apneumonia"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; can be effectively treated at home and do not need to be hospitalized. This finding is hugely significant for developing countries where children cannot be brought to a hospital easily or where no hospitals exist. 

Per the study the change of treatment could save many children's lives and take pressure off health systems. Every year pneumonia kills 2 million children under the age of 5. The researchers found that antibiotics given at home could significantly reduce deaths.

The group examined 2,037 children between 3 to 59 months in seven areas in &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;. About half of them were given antibiotics and sent home while the other ones got intravenous &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aantibiotics"&gt;antibiotics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the hospital. Both groups were found to show equal progress in healing off the illness. 

Current WHO guidelines recommend that pneumonia should be treated in a hospital with injectable antibiotics. With the new study there are indicators that pneumonia can be treated just as effectively at home with oral antibiotics.

The threat of terrorism has caused the cancellation yesterday of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2008%20Dakar%20Rally"&gt;2008 Dakar Rally&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , due to start today. The race, which was to be the 30th consecutive rally, was to start in &lt;a href="Lisbon"&gt;Lisbon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Portugal"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt; and end on January 20 in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADakar"&gt;Dakar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Senegal"&gt;Senegal&lt;/a&gt; having crossed the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASahara%20Desert"&gt;Sahara Desert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The endurance event is the world’s biggest off-road rally and &lt;a href="Paris"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;-based organisers &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAmaury%20Sport%20Organisation"&gt;Amaury Sport Organisation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; had said as late as Thursday that more than 500 cars, trucks, motorcycles and quads from fifty different countries were ready to go as scheduled. However, the organisation changed its mind under pressure from the &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APolitics%20of%20France"&gt;government&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

&lt;a href="Al-Qaida"&gt;Al-Qaida&lt;/a&gt;-linked groups are believed to have planned to attack the rally, and it is reported that specific threats were made against it by al-Qaida in the &lt;a href="Islam"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMagreb"&gt;Magreb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a regional &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;n offshoot. The day before Christmas a French family on holiday in &lt;a href="Mauritania"&gt;Mauritania&lt;/a&gt; was murdered and al-Qaida are believed to be responsible; the rally was scheduled to spend eight days in Mauritania.

Al-Qaida in the Islamic Magreb have recently seen a crackdown by authorities, but are continuing their operations and are now seeking to strike international targets. Last month they bombed the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; headquarters in &lt;a href="Algiers"&gt;Algiers&lt;/a&gt;; that attack killed 37.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Apolitics%20of%20Maritania"&gt;Mauritanian government&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; had promised a 3,000-strong security force to protect the competitors but the remote location of the desert and scrubland involved would make effective security arrangements almost impossible. French security consultant Louis Caprioli, former anti-terrorism head at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADirection%20de%20la%20Surveillance%20du%20Territoire"&gt;Direction de la Surveillance du Territoire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , said “You would need really incredible security precautions, and I don’t think it’s possible with the new techniques of attack, such as suicide bombings.”
French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said yesterday that Amuary had been warned by government officials that it would be too dangerous to go ahead with the plan. After last-minute meetings with ministry officials. “No other decision but the cancellation of the sporting event could be taken,” said a statement on Amuary’s website.

Caprioli said the terrorists intended to prove “They can chase out the infidels. The cancellation was wise. But it gives the impression that the terrorists have won.”

Patrice Clerc, head of Amuary, stated “When you are told of direct threats against the event and when the sinister name of al-Qaeda is mentioned, you don’t ask for details. It was enough for me to hear my government say the danger is at a maximum.”

Security has caused many concerns for the race over the years. Extremists tend to view the race as a prime target, as it is highly covered by the media, and is a rare concentration of Westerners. As a result, major security measures have had to be undertaken by French and African authorities. Almost 50 people have been killed, several of whom at the hands of African fighters. Although there are fears for the future of the race, Amuary said that the event would continue in the future. “The Dakar is a symbol, and nothing can destroy symbols,” they said. “The cancellation of the 2008 edition does not endanger the future of the Dakar.” However, they have confirmed that it is unlikely Mauritania will be a destination in future events. Competitors in the event, however, are less optimistic, with many saying that they feel the race will not go ahead next year. Newspapers in &lt;a href="Senegal"&gt;Senegal&lt;/a&gt; have described the cancellation as a death sentence. Meanwhile, the town of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APortimao"&gt;Portimao&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in Portugal, intended to be the rally’s first scheduled stop, are considering filing for damages against Amuary.

Victor Anderes, vice-president of a New York firm specialising in high-profile event security, called the cancellation an unprecedented one in sporting history, saying “Smaller cultural events have been cancelled , but this hasn’t happened with such a major international event.” However, he did accept that “The threat is significant. It would be almost impossible to secure the entire course.”

Authorities in the western &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; state of &lt;a href="Nevada"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt; say near-freezing waters from a ruptured canal have flooded about 800 homes following a powerful winter storm.

Authorities east of the city of &lt;a href="w%3AReno%2C%20Nevada"&gt;Reno&lt;/a&gt; say a nine-meter-long section of the Truckee Canal broke early Saturday, sending a nearly one-meter-high flood into the small town of &lt;a href="w%3AFernley%2C%20Nevada"&gt;Fernley&lt;/a&gt;. They say more than 3,000 people have been affected by the flooding, with many evacuated to a local school.

There are no reports of any injuries.

In neighboring &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, the fierce Pacific storm system brought winds of up to 240 kilometers an hour, leaving more than one million people without power Friday.

One of the hardest hit areas is the &lt;a href="w%3ASierra%20Nevada%20%28U.S.%29"&gt;Sierra Nevada&lt;/a&gt; mountain region, where the storm turned into an arctic blizzard in the upper elevations. Forecasters say the region will get anywhere from two to three meters of snow by Sunday.

Forecasters also say the storm could dump as much as 25 centimeters of rain on parts of southern California.

The heavy rains could trigger flash floods and mudslides in areas burned during last year's massive &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20California%20wildfires"&gt;wildfires&lt;/a&gt;. Officials have ordered a mandatory evacuation of thousands of homes near &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%2C%20California"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;.

On the morning of January 4, 2008, while at the &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20World%20Junior%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships"&gt;2008 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships&lt;/a&gt;, 19-year-old goalie Steve Mason received a phone call from Canada informing him that he was traded by the &lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20Hockey%20League"&gt;Ontario Hockey League's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Knights"&gt;London Knights&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="w%3AKitchener%20Rangers"&gt;Kitchener Rangers&lt;/a&gt;.

In a press release Friday, Kitchener Rangers Head coach and General Manager Peter DeBoer announced the trade to the Knights. In return for obtaining Mason, the Rangers have sent the Knights, Centre Phil Varone, Defenceman Steve Tarasuk along with 2nd, 3rd and 4th round draft picks in 2011 and a 2nd round pick in 2012.

Mason said that he had an enjoyable time playing for the London Knights, but nonetheless, he believes that he has a bright future playing for the Kitchener Rangers. He also notes that he doesn't want the trade to distract him from playing in the Gold Medal Game, against &lt;a href="w%3ASweden%20national%20men%27s%20ice%20hockey%20team"&gt;Team Sweden&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3ACanada%20national%20junior%20hockey%20team"&gt;Team Canada&lt;/a&gt; won the game in overtime 3-2.

A &lt;a href="w%3APiper%20Aircraft"&gt;Piper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APiper%20PA-31%20Navajo"&gt;PA-31 Navajo Chieftain&lt;/a&gt; owned and operated by Servant Air has crashed shortly after takeoff from &lt;a href="w%3AKodiak%20Island"&gt;Kodiak Island&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Alaska"&gt;Alaska&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. Six people were killed and four others were rescued.

The flight was a 100 mile scheduled domestic charter flight from Kodiak to &lt;a href="w%3AHomer%2C%20Alaska"&gt;Homer&lt;/a&gt;. Servant Air are a small local airline that serves Kodiak, which has a population of around 6,000. The airline was founded in 2003 and currently operates seven planes. The plane took off at 1:48 p.m. local time Saturday and subsequently crashed in a shallow harbor 50 yards from the runway.

Dean Andrew, who was piloting a float plane taxiing on the water nearby, was able to rescue four people from the crashed plane. "Once I got them in they were really cold, and they were just pretty hysterical because they had told me that their family's in that plane," said Andrew, who the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Tribune%20Herald"&gt;International Tribune Herald&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reports operates his own small air service, although the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASeattle%20Times"&gt;Seattle Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reported that he flew the plane for Trident Seafoods.

Alaska State Troopers and Kodiak Police divers were called in to retrieve the bodies of four others. A fifth was pulled out the water after attempting to swim 300 yards to shore, but he had already succumbed to the cold.

The passengers were &lt;a href="w%3ARussian%20Orthodox"&gt;Russian Orthodox&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AOld%20Believers"&gt;Old Believers&lt;/a&gt; who had chartered the flight home in order to celebrate &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n Christmas, which is celebrated on Monday. The deceased have been identified as Homer citizens Stefan F. Basargin, 36; Pavel F. Basargin, 30; Zahary F. Martushev, 25; Iosif F. Martushev, 15; Andrian Reutov, 22 and local pilot Robin Starrett, 50. The survivors, who have not been identified, are all in good condition or out of hospital. Two were flown to &lt;a href="w%3AAnchorage"&gt;Anchorage&lt;/a&gt; for treatment and two remained in Kodak; in both cases one was released and one remains.

Andrew described the moments leading up to the crash: "I heard Servant Air's Navajo taking off, and shortly after he took off, he said, 'I need to return to the airport.' I know the pilot, and I could tell by the tone of his voice that it was probably something serious."

The US &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Transportation%20Safety%20Board"&gt;National Transportation Safety Board&lt;/a&gt; (NTSB) has opened a full investigation. NTSB investigator Clint Johnson told reporters it's possible that mechanical problems with the plane caused the accident.

Ted Panamarioff, spokesman for Servant Air, said of Starrett "Very humble, very caring. Very detail oriented. Very precise in the way he did things. He was an excellent family man. Excellent co-worker." He also said that Starrett had served in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Coast%20Guard"&gt;Coast Guard&lt;/a&gt;, and that those involved were regular customers well known with the small airline. "We're all family and friends here. We knew these customers for several years. This is really, really tragic."

<h1>News briefs:January 06, 2008</h1>
<h2>Wikinews News Brief 06 Jan 07 1800 UTC</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
[Opening music] This is Wikinews News Brief, summarising today’s top stories on Sunday 6th January 2008 at 19:32 hours GMT. I’m Nicholas Turnbull.
<h3>Nevada, Northern California struck by massive storm</h3>
A ruptured canal has flooded approximately 800 homes in the western U.S. state of Nevada. According to local authorities, a nine-meter section of the Truckee Canal broke early on Saturday morning, sending a nearly one-meter high flood into the small town of Fernley. It is thought that more than 3,000 people have been affected by the flooding; many have been evacuated to a local school. No reports of any injuries or fatalities have yet been issued. 
Neighbouring California has suffered winds of up to 240 kilometres per hour brought by the fierce Pacific storm system, leaving more than one milion people without power on Friday. The Sierra Nevada mountain region has been hit particularly hard, the storm turning into an arctic blizzard at its highest points. Weather forecasters estimate two to three metres of snow will fall in the region by Sunday. It is also thought that 25 centimetres of rain may fall in parts of southern California, which could trigger flash floods and mudslides in areas burned in last year’s extensive wildfires. Officials have ordered a mandatory evacuation of thousands of home near Los Angeles.
<h3>2008 Dakar Rally cancelled over terrorist threat</h3>
The 2008 Dakar Rally, due to start yesterday, has been cancelled due to reported threats of attack by terrorist group al-Qaida. The Dakar Rally is an annual off-road motor vehicle race that runs from from Lisbon in Portugal to Dakar in Senegal, traversing the Sahara Desert, and is the world’s biggest off-road rally. More than 500 vehicles were to participate in the race, the 30th since the rally’s inception. It has been reported that specific threats have been made against the rally by al-Qaida. It is thought that al-Qaida were responsible for the murder of a French family of holidaymakers in Mauritania on Christmas Eve, and the rally was due to spend eight days in Mauritania. The Mauritanian government had promised a security force of 3,000 personnel to protect the competitors; however, it is thought that the remote location of the desert and scrubland would have rendered this security effort ineffective. Event organisers had initially stated that the event would take place as planned regardless of the threats, but pressure from the French government is thought to have lead to Friday’s decision to cancel the event this year.

<h3>Baby attacked by dog in New York</h3>
In Brooklyn, New York, an eight-month year old boy named Andrew Stein was mauled to death yesterday by a pet dog whilst being babysitted by his grandmother. The dog, a three-year old Doberman pinscher, was shot with a tranquillizer and impounded after a neighbour removed the dog from Andrew and attempted to rescuscitate him whilst awaiting assistance from the emergency services. Despite medical professionals operating on Andrew for nearly an hour, the attack proved fatal, the boy dying at 2006 hours UTC. Police have stated that the baby’s head was severely disfigured by the attack and that the boy’s skull had been broken. The city’s Department of Health is investigating the incident.
<h3>Former Indonesian president, Suharto in critical condition</h3>
The former president of Indonesia, Suharto, aged 86, is in a Jakarta hospital in critical condition as a result of heart problems. The former president was admitted to a hospital on Friday with swelling throughout his body, and it appears that his heart and kidneys are deteriorating. Mr. Suharto is accused by the anti-corruption organisation Transparency Internation of embezzling over $15 billion USD from Indonesia’s government; Mr. Suharto has vehemently denied these accusations. He stepped down from Indonesia’s presidency following demonstrations and rioting during the Asian economic crisis of 1998, ending 32 years of uninterrupted rule.
<h3>President Bush urges progress on Palestinian state; Israel to welcome President Bush with 'open arms'</h3>
United States President George W. Bush is due to visit the Middle East next week in an effort to encourage dialogue between Israeli and Palestinian authorities towards creating an independent Palestinian state. Mr. Bush is intending to keep Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert [ehood-all-mert] and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas focused on the main agenda, despite the considerable obstacles present towards establishing Palestinian independence. Mr. Olmert says that Israel will welcome the arrival of Mr. Bush warmly.
Mr. Bush leaves on Tuesday for Israel and the West Bank, where he will hold separate talks with Palestinian and Israeli leaders prior to visiting Kuwait, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Dubai, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt. 
<h3>Extremist group claims responsibilty for killing of American diplomat in Sudan</h3>
A previously unknown militant group, which names itself Ansar al-Tawhid (Companions of Monotheism), claimed responsibility for killing United States Agency for International Development diplomat John Granville and his Sudanese driver Abdel Rahman Abbas in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum on New Year’s Day. The name of this militant group has been used by other groups in the past. The claim was posted on a Web site used by Islamic fundamentalists. The claim has not yet been authenticated. Granville was being driven home from a New Year’s Day party when another vehicle blocked the road ahead of his car, and the assailants opened fire. It had previously been suggested that Abbas and Granville had been killed accidentally in crossfire, but this is no longer thought to be true. Sudan’s foreign ministry has stated that the shooting was an isolated incident with no political connotations.
<h3>Lakota Freedom Delegation says spokesman Russell Means 'hijacked' organization</h3>
The Lakota Freedom Delegation (also known as “Lakotah Oyate”), an organisation of activists campaigning for the Sioux Indian Nation to withdraw all treaties with the United States, has been “hijacked” by its spokesman Russell Means according to Naomi Archer, a liason of the organisation. A letter was hand-delivered to the United States States Department claiming a declaration by the Lakota Indian Tribe to cancel all treaties between the tribe and the United States on December the 19th by Means and other members of the delegation.

In an interview with Wikinews, Ms. Archer claims that Means took control of the organisation and its official website and that this declaration is not representative of the views of the Lakota people. Ms. Archer added that the Lakota Freedom Delegation is not a government entity, does not make decisions for the Nation, and that the actions of the Lakota people are not determined by one person alone.

<h3>Kucinich suggests tonight's Democratic debate unfair, files FCC charges versus ABC</h3>
A complaint has been filed with the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) against tonight’s Democratic party broadcast on the US television station ABC. The complaint has been filed by the “Kuchinich for President” campaign, which claims that the exclusion of Kuchinich from the public debate is in violation of ABC’s obligation to operate in the public interest. However, Mr. Kuchinich did not contest the inclusion rules when they were announced. An ABC spokesperson refused to comment on the basis that she had not yet read the FCC filing at the time of interview.
<h3>Childhood pneumonia can be cured at home</h3>
A new study of children suffering from pneumonia in Pakistan carried out by researchers of Boston University's School of Public Health has shown that children with severe pneumonia can be effectively treated at home and do not need to be hospitalized. Current World Health Organisation guidelines recommend that pneumonia should be treated in a hospital with injectable antibiotics. Over 2,000 children infected with pneumonia were examined across Pakistan, half of which were given antibiotics to take at home and half were given intravenous antibiotics in hospital. Both groups recovered with equal progress. This finding is hugely significant for developing countries where children cannot be brought to a hospital easily or where no hospitals exist.
<h3>Queen voted Britain's greatest band</h3>
In entertainment, British rock band Queen have been voted Britain's greatest band by BBC Radio 2 listeners. More than 20,000 people voted for the band, which was one of five finalists selected by listeners over the previous week. DJ Mark Goodier then hosted a three-hour live show on New Year's day to discuss the five contenders.
Votes were cast via e-mail, text message and telephone, with Queen competing with The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Take That and Oasis. It was then revealed live on air that Queen were the winners, with iconic band The Beatles just 400 votes behind their score.
<h3>London Knights trade Steve Mason to Kitchener Rangers</h3>
In Canadian sport, ice hockey goal keeper Steve Mason has been traded by the Ontario Hockey League’s London Knights to the Kitchener Rangers, receiving a telephone call informing him of the agreement whilst at the 2008 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. Mason stated that he had enjoyed playing for the London Knights but also that he sees a bright future playing for the Kitchener Rangers.

<h1>Wikipedians support the Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity by bidding on Wikipedia DVDs</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Wikipedians%20support%20the%20Great%20Orchestra%20of%20Christmas%20Charity%20by%20bidding%20on%20Wikipedia%20DVDs&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

On Thursday, January 3, a special &lt;a href="w%3AAllegro.pl"&gt;Allegro.pl&lt;/a&gt; auction for the benefit of the &lt;a href="w%3AGreat%20Orchestra%20of%20Christmas%20Charity"&gt;Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity&lt;/a&gt; featured items donated by ♡❤Stowarzyszenie Wikimedia Polska♡❤, the local polish chapter of the Wikimedia Foundation. Among the items were ten &lt;a href="w%3ADVD"&gt;DVD's&lt;/a&gt; containing the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3APolish%20language"&gt;Polish language&lt;/a&gt; edition of &lt;a href="Wikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the offers in the online auction came from people who actually helped to create the contents of the DVD.

One of the discs reached the "Featured Items" status on the same day when the item was offered for sale. Each of the ten DVDs has been autographed by a number of Wikipedians, mainly those who helped in creating the edition, together with ♡❤Helion Publishing House♡❤. The release contains 238,000 articles whose quality had been checked by a panel of editors, complete with illustrations. It is the first stable version of the Polish-language Wikipedia.

The decision to offer the ten copies at the auction was taken in September 2007. Since then, the covers of the auction items have been circulating throughout Poland, in order to collect as many Wikimedians' signatures as possible during a number of Wikimedia events. All of the autographs are nicknames that the editors use in their daily work. Among them is e.g. the signature of the founder of Polish Wikipedia. &lt;a href="w%3Apl%3AKrzysztof%20Jasiutowicz"&gt;Krzysztof Jasiutowicz&lt;/a&gt;, nicknamed ♡❤Kpjas♡❤. 

Among the people who placed an offer to buy one of the ten copies in the initial 24 hours of the auction were the Polish Wikipedians known as Zureks, Jersz, Pimke, Vindicator, Rdrozd, Paterm, Bartekbas, Airwolf, Mathel, Nemo5576, Wyksztalcioch, Wpedzich and Kotasik.

Earlier, ♡❤Stowarzyszenie Wikimedia Polska♡❤, a local chapter of The Wikimedia Foundation, decided together with Helion for those DVDs which have not been sold yet to be donated to various communities that would find them useful, mainly schools. Although currently Wikipedia contains about twice as many articles as the DVD version and it is freely available online, the income from the auction will add to the budget of a much older organisation, which is one of Poland's charity &lt;a href="w%3ANGO"&gt;NGOs&lt;/a&gt;.

♡❤Stowarzyszenie Wikimedia Polska♡❤ will prepare a special website for those people who offer the highest bids for the ten Wikipedia DVD copies, where they will be able to put their photos (together with the discs they have acquired), if they wish.

The auctions will end on the day of the Grand Finalé of the Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity, January 13th, at 20:00 CET.

<h1>Mikheil Saakashvili re-elected President of Georgia</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Mikheil%20Saakashvili%20re-elected%20President%20of%20Georgia&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Election officials have declared &lt;a href="w%3AMikheil%20Saakashvili"&gt;Mikheil Saakashvili&lt;/a&gt; the winner of the presidential election, which occurred earlier than usual due to &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Georgian%20demonstrations"&gt;anti-government protests&lt;/a&gt; in November 2007. He garnered 52.8% of the vote, while the leading opposition candidate &lt;a href="w%3ALevan%20Gachechiladze"&gt;Levan Gachechiladze&lt;/a&gt; came in second with 27% of the vote.

The election had been a controversial one, with opposition leaders claiming it was unfair and that Saakashvili had rigged the vote in his favor. Allegations of intimidation, media bias, and vote buying were widespread.

In a report, the &lt;a href="w%3AOrganization%20for%20Security%20and%20Cooperation%20in%20Europe"&gt;Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe&lt;/a&gt; (OSCE) called the election "consistent with most O.S.C.E. and &lt;a href="w%3ACouncil%20of%20Europe"&gt;Council of Europe&lt;/a&gt; commitments and standards for democratic elections", but also noted violations, including people apparently voting more than once at certain polling stations and some ballot boxes not being properly sealed. Giorgi Kandelaki, a spokesman for the Justice Ministry, responded by saying there were "very few violations that could be regarded as serious".
After exit polls showed Saakashvili in the lead on Saturday, he declared an early victory, which prompted thousands of protesters to gather in &lt;a href="w%3ATbilisi"&gt;Tbilisi&lt;/a&gt;. Gachechiladze spoke at the rally, saying, "We have won despite pressure, despite intimidation, despite televised terror exerted against us." He said that the opposition will contest the results in court and scheduled another rally on January 8, since Georgia celebrates &lt;a href="w%3AChristmas"&gt;Christmas&lt;/a&gt; on Monday.

&lt;a href="w%3AAlcee%20Hastings"&gt;Alcee Hastings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; Congressman and coordinator of OSCE, called for the protesters to regard the election as legitimate and for the government to institute electoral reforms in time for upcoming parliamentary elections. "I perceive this election as a viable expression of free choice of the Georgian people, but the future holds immense challenges," Hastings said.

This year &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; turns sixty and it has embarked upon a campaign to celebrate its birthday. Along with technology writers for ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASlate.com"&gt;Slate&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3APC%20Magazine"&gt;PC Magazine&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AUSA%20Today"&gt;USA Today&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABusinessWeek"&gt;BusinessWeek&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAviation%20Weekly"&gt;Aviation Weekly&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ was invited by the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerica-Israel%20Friendship%20League"&gt;America-Israel Friendship League&lt;/a&gt; and the Israeli Foreign Ministry to review Israel’s technology sector. It's part of an effort to '&lt;a href="w%3ARe-brand"&gt;re-brand&lt;/a&gt; the country' to show America that there is more to Israel than the &lt;a href="w%3AIsraeli-Palestinian%20conflict"&gt;Palestinian conflict&lt;/a&gt;. On this trip we saw the people who gave us the &lt;a href="w%3APentium%20processor"&gt;Pentium processor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AICQ"&gt;Instant Messaging&lt;/a&gt;. The schedule was hectic: 12-14 hours a day were spent doing everything from trips to the &lt;a href="w%3AWeizmann%20Institute"&gt;Weizmann Institute&lt;/a&gt; to dinner with . 

On Thursday, the fifth day of the junket, David Saranga of the foreign ministry was able to arrange an exclusive interview for with the &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20Israel"&gt;President of Israel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANobel%20Peace%20Prize"&gt;Nobel Peace Prize&lt;/a&gt; recipient &lt;a href="w%3AShimon%20Peres"&gt;Shimon Peres&lt;/a&gt;. For over an hour they spoke about Iranian politics, whether Israel is in danger of being side-lined in Middle Eastern importance because of Arab oil wealth, and his thoughts against those who say Israeli culture is in a state of decay. 
Shimon Peres spent his early days on &lt;a href="w%3Akibbutz"&gt;kibbutz&lt;/a&gt;, a bygone socialist era of Israel. In 1953, at the age of 29, Peres became the youngest ever Director General of the Ministry of Defense. Forty years later it was Peres who secretly gave the green light for dialogue with &lt;a href="w%3AYassir%20Arafat"&gt;Yassir Arafat&lt;/a&gt;, of the verboten &lt;a href="w%3APalestine%20Liberation%20Organization"&gt;Palestine Liberation Organization&lt;/a&gt;. It was still official Israeli policy to not speak with the PLO. Peres shares a Nobel Peace Prize with Yitzak Rabin and Arafat for orchestrating what eventually became the &lt;a href="w%3AOslo%20Accords"&gt;Oslo Accords&lt;/a&gt;. The "roadmap" that came out of Oslo remains the official Israeli (and American) policy for peace in the Palestinian conflict. Although the majority of Israeli people supported the plans, land for peace was met with a small but fiery resistance in Israel. For negotiating with Arafat, former Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ABenjamin%20Netanyahu"&gt;Benjamin Netanyahu&lt;/a&gt; shouted at Peres, "You are worse than &lt;a href="w%3ANeville%20Chamberlain"&gt;Chamberlain&lt;/a&gt;!" a reference to Hitler's British appeaser. It was during this time of heated exchanges in the 1990s that &lt;a href="w%3AYitzhak%20Rabin"&gt;Yitzhak Rabin&lt;/a&gt; was assassinated by &lt;a href="w%3AYigal%20Amir"&gt;Yigal Amir&lt;/a&gt;, a Jew who thought it against &lt;a href="w%3AHalakha"&gt;Halakhic law&lt;/a&gt; to give up land given by God (&lt;a href="w%3ANames%20of%20God%20in%20Judaism"&gt;Hashem&lt;/a&gt;).

Peres is the elder statesman of Israeli politics, but he remembers that he has not always been as popular as he is today. "Popularity is like perfume: nice to smell, dangerous to drink," said Peres. "You don’t drink it." The search for popularity, he goes on to say, will kill a person who has an idea against the status quo. 

Below is 's interview with Shimon Peres, the President of Israel.
<h2>Israeli technology</h2>
♡❤♡David Shankbone: One of your big initiatives in technology has been &lt;a href="w%3ANanotechnology"&gt;nanotechnology&lt;/a&gt;. 

♡❤♡DS: What made you focus on nanotechnology as a sector for Israeli investment?

♡❤♡DS: The bomb?

♡❤♡DS: To miniaturize?

♡❤♡DS: That’s amazing.

♡❤♡DS: Are you satisfied with the progress in the nanotechnology sector here in Israel?

<h2>The future of the peace process in Israel</h2>

♡❤♡DS: Mr. President, as a &lt;a href="w%3ANobel%20Peace%20Prize"&gt;Nobel Peace Prize&lt;/a&gt; recipient and as one of the fathers of the modern &lt;a href="w%3APeace%20process%20in%20the%20Israeli-Palestinian%20conflict"&gt;peace process in Israel&lt;/a&gt;, do you still think that there is a future to the peace process?

♡❤♡DS: How do you approach the difficult challenge of talking to the Palestinians when, in the end, they don’t want Israel to exist. How do you come to an understanding to make peace possible?

♡❤♡DS: How do you feel about that?

<h2>The waning importance of history</h2>
♡❤♡DS: Isn’t the answer to that question that wise decisions are made with a basis from memory? Although a computer can have…

♡❤♡DS: What about the adage, “Those who forget history are doomed to repeat it”?

♡❤♡DS: Don’t you think Darfur is repetition?

♡❤♡DS: Like Dubai?

♡❤♡DS: A criticism of the Arab states is that back in the 1990s they had squandered the wealth that they were making on the high oil price because they had not invested it wisely. It seems that that has changed, that the Arabs are creating these &lt;a href="w%3ASovereign%20wealth%20funds"&gt;new wealth funds&lt;/a&gt; and that much of the money that is generated in the Middle East is now coming from Arab states. Are you worried that Israel will become increasingly marginalized in the Middle East? Right now it’s very &lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20War"&gt;Iraq War&lt;/a&gt; focused or &lt;a href="w%3AForeign%20relations%20of%20Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;-focused or the &lt;a href="w%3AArab%20states%20of%20the%20Persian%20Gulf"&gt;Emirates around the Gulf with their money&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Is Israel a united society?</h2>

♡❤♡DS: As you know, I’m part of a group from a technology mission over here of journalists. We went to Meytav, your largest technology incubator, and spoke with their Vice President Norman Sandberg. One of the things that he raised as an issue is that Israeli society is becoming dichotomized between Tel Aviv and the rest of the country. How do you develop the brainpower without Israel becoming a city-state with Tel Aviv? Mr. Sandberg told us nobody wants to go to the &lt;a href="w%3A%20North%20District%20%28Israel%29"&gt;North&lt;/a&gt;. They want to stay in Tel Aviv. They don’t want to actually spread out and work on developing the rest of the country and invest outside of there. Is that a problem that you foresee that this bubble is forming around Tel Aviv in terms of brainpower?

♡❤♡DS: When you speak of language, &lt;a href="w%3AHebrew"&gt;Hebrew&lt;/a&gt; is very unique. At a time when &lt;a href="w%3AExtinct%20language"&gt;languages are disappearing&lt;/a&gt;, Hebrew is the &lt;a href="w%3ARevival%20of%20the%20Hebrew%20language"&gt;only example that I know of a language revived successfully&lt;/a&gt;. Although I don’t speak Hebrew, I understand that the quality of Hebrew spoken by the younger generations has decreased.

♡❤♡DS: You used to not want to see the legs. [♡❤Laughs♡❤]

♡❤♡DS: What informs the question I asked about Hebrew is that it seems to build such a cohesive society here in Israel. It’s one of the binding forces...

♡❤♡DS: One value used to be military service. 20 years ago it was anathema to not serve in the military and that was another binding cohesive force in Israeli society and now it’s quite common...

♡❤♡DS: Do you think Israel’s security is at a point where it can move from being concerned with military service to being unconcerned and moving more towards competition in sports or the creative elements?

<h2>Iran: will Israel strike first?</h2>
♡❤♡DS: With Iran, do you think that Israel would ever need to act unilaterally &lt;a href="w%3AOperation%20Opera"&gt;again&lt;/a&gt;, to make a strike, in response to their nuclear capabilities? The U.S. National Intelligence Estimate, which is quite controversial, said that they’ve stopped their nuclear weapons program, yet there are many centrifuges in &lt;a href="w%3ANatanz"&gt;Natanz&lt;/a&gt; that are still producing material.

♡❤♡DS: Are you saying the Iranian people will be the agents of change?

♡❤♡DS: But there was so much hope for &lt;a href="w%3AMohammad%20Khatami"&gt;Mohammad Khatami&lt;/a&gt; and yet his administration ended up a disappointment--

♡❤♡DS: But the Iranian people seem to be rallying around their nuclear program.

♡❤♡DS: As part of a coalition?

♡❤♡DS: And you feel it would be a mistake for Israel to act unilaterally, or not?

♡❤♡DS: You don’t feel America plays that role with Israel?

♡❤♡DS: Although they face it quite often in Iraq and Afghanistan.

<h2>The 2006 Lebanon War</h2>

Christopher Lee McCuin, 25, from &lt;a href="Tyler%2C%20Texas"&gt;Tyler&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; has been arrested after police found him possibly preparing to eat the body parts of his dead girlfriend, Jana Shearer aged 21. He was also charged with stabbing his ex-wife's boyfriend, William Veasley, 42. 

According to reports, Shearer's mother was told by McCuin to "look in the garage" where she discovered the mutilated body of her daughter. She then flagged down a police officer on the road.

McCuin called 911 after the mother left the house. According to reports, he told the dispatcher that he was boiling Shearer's body parts and preparing to eat them. When police got to his home, they discovered one of Shearer's ears boiling in a pot, and an unnamed piece of her flesh on the kitchen table, with silverware placed beside it. The rest of her body had several "chunks" missing from it, according to the ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATyler%20Morning%20Telegraph"&gt;Tyler Morning Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ quoting Sheriff J.B. Smith of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASmith%20County%2C%20Texas"&gt;Smith County&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Sheriff's Department.

Police later found out that McCuin had stabbed his ex-wife's boyfriend, and also broke into ♡❤Tyler Custom Openings♡❤, a local business, sometime on Friday or Saturday. He started by going to Shearer's home on Friday January 4 to have a discussion with her, but she was never seen alive again. Before stabbing Veasley, he beat Shearer "with a blunt object, multiple times" to death. On Saturday morning, he arrived at his ex-wife's home and fought with Veasley, stabbing him. He is currently in critical condition at a local hospital.

McCuin then broke into the ♡❤Tyler Custom Openings♡❤ and then went to his mother's house where he took her to his home to show her what he had done. Although McCuin was inside the house when police arrived, he was able to escape and was chased for a short distance before being caught again.

McCuin is currently being held on a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; $2,000,000 bail at Smith County jail.

The &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Supreme%20Court"&gt;U.S. Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; is hearing arguments on the constitutionality of the use of &lt;a href="w%3ALethal%20Injection"&gt;lethal injection&lt;/a&gt; as a method for the imposition of the death penalty in the United States. Two men, &lt;a href="w%3ARalph%20Baze"&gt;Ralph Baze&lt;/a&gt; and , who were convicted of murder in the Commonwealth of &lt;a href="Kentucky"&gt;Kentucky&lt;/a&gt; and sentenced to death, sued the state in 2004 arguing that the use of lethal injection as a method of imposition of capital punishment violates the &lt;a href="w%3AEighth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution"&gt;Eighth Amendment's&lt;/a&gt; prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. 

Thirty-seven states and the Federal Government have capital punishment for some crimes, all except Nebraska (which uses electrocution) use lethal injection. The process uses three chemicals in a "cocktail", which, by the procedures that are used to apply them to the condemned, (three injections given consecutively) allegedly "create a significant and unnecessary risk of inflicting severe pain that could be prevented by the adoption of reasonable safeguards", their lawyers said in court papers. "Kentucky seeks to execute in a relatively humane manner and has worked hard to adopt such a procedure," Kentucky Attorney General Gregory Stumbo has said. The state has also argued in its brief against supporting the plaintiffs' appeal that it will lead to "an endless road of litigation. ... Condemned inmates will never run out of ideas for changes to the procedures, drugs or equipment used during lethal injection."

Baze was scheduled to be executed on January 8 after Governor of Kentucky &lt;a href="w%3AErnie%20Fletcher"&gt;Ernie Fletcher&lt;/a&gt; signed his death warrant, but the Kentucky Supreme Court suspended his execution on September 12, 2007, arguing it needed more time to examine arguments he had made in a separate appeal. He was convicted of killing Powell County Sheriff Steve Bennett and Deputy Arthur Briscoe in 1992 while the lawmen were trying to serve him with arrest warrants. Bowling was convicted of killing Edward and Tina Earley in &lt;a href="w%3ALouisville"&gt;Louisville&lt;/a&gt; in 1990. 

According to the article on &lt;a href="w%3Alethal%20injection"&gt;lethal injection&lt;/a&gt; in Wikipedia, the three chemicals used are Sodium thiopental to render the offender unconscious; Pancuronium/Tubocurarine: to stop all muscle movement except the heart, causing muscle paralysis, collapse of the diaphragm, and would eventually cause death by asphyxiation; and Potassium chloride to stop the heart. The chemicals apparently cannot be combined together as they could precipitate into a solid and be ineffective. It is argued that thiopental is a very short-term anesthetic and may wear off during the procedure, causing anesthesia awareness and excruciating pain from the effects of the other drugs.

In oral hearings today, the justices seemed skeptical that the chemical concoction causes extreme pain or that a better method was available. A lawyer for one of the plaintiffs argued that if insufficient anesthetic is given, when the inmate is given the paralyzing drug, they will experience agonizing pain, but be unable to react, and that it is even illegal in Kentucky to euthanize animals in this fashion. Some of the justices have considered sending the case back for further hearings to determine if a single barbiturate would be superior to the current method.

While the Supreme Court has examined the application of the death penalty many times over the past 40 years, this is the first time the court has reviewed the issue of the method of execution in 100 years, according to lawyers for the plaintiffs. A ruling is not expected until June. There are about 3,000 people on death row in the United States, and about 60 are executed each year. Since the case was accepted by the Supreme Court, all executions in the United States have been temporarily suspended pending the decision.

The case name is ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABaze%20v.%20Rees"&gt;Baze v. Rees&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

The first &lt;a href="w%3Asunspot"&gt;sunspot&lt;/a&gt; marking a new &lt;a href="w%3ASolar%20cycle"&gt;solar cycle&lt;/a&gt; has been identified, physicists at the NOAA announced on January 4. This sunspot is a precursor for the normal increase in activity which takes place during the 11-year solar cycle.

"This sunspot is like the first robin of spring. In this case, it’s an early omen of solar storms that will gradually increase over the next few years," said solar physicist Douglas Biesecker of &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Oceanic%20and%20Atmospheric%20Administration"&gt;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&lt;/a&gt;’s (NOAA) Space Weather Prediction Center.

The new sunspot, identified as #10,981, is the latest visible spot to appear since NOAA began numbering them on January 5, 1972. Its high-latitude location at 27 degrees North, and its negative polarity leading to the right in the Northern Hemisphere are clear-cut signs of a new solar cycle, according to NOAA experts. The first active regions and sunspots of a new solar cycle can emerge at high latitudes while those from the previous cycle continue to form closer to the equator.

The sunspot has been reported by several observatories, confirming this is the first spot which developed into a visible sunspot group. SpaceWeather.com reported that it produced auroras on Jan. 5th. "It was a nice flowing display that persisted for an hour and a half," reports photographer Calvin Hall of Palmer, Alaska.

A sunspot is an area of highly organized magnetic activity on the surface of the sun. The new 11-year cycle is expected to build gradually, with the number of sunspots and solar storms reaching a maximum by 2011 or 2012, though devastating storms can occur at any time.

The &lt;a href="2008%20Taipei%20Game%20Show"&gt;2008 Taipei Game Show&lt;/a&gt;, organized by Taipei Computer Association, supported by Bahamut Gamer Community, will begin on January 24 and then close on the 28 at the &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20World%20Trade%20Center"&gt;Taipei World Trade Center&lt;/a&gt;. This exhibition is sponsored by &lt;a href="w%3AFamilyMart"&gt;FamilyMart&lt;/a&gt; and titled the official motto with "Where You Are One of the Gamers" (in &lt;a href="w%3AChinese"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt;: 全家都是玩家) to invite the public to visit the show.

Not only the main show and the votes of the 2007 Taiwan Digital Contents Award, but world-class experts from the gaming industry like &lt;a href="w%3AYoshiyuki%20Tomino"&gt;Yoshiyuki Tomino&lt;/a&gt; and David Gould will share experiences about gaming developments at the 2008 Taiwan Digital Content Forum.

According to the organizer, the award ceremony of the Taiwan Digital Contents Award was held before the main show in the past, but due to the schedule and arrangements of the Industrial Development Bureau of Ministry of Economic Affairs, the organizer decided to exhibit nominees from the 2007 Taiwan Digital Contents Award and postpone the award ceremony to February.

For the issues on noise and flow of people, the organizer will bring some security policy by the venue owner &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan%20External%20Trade%20Development%20Council"&gt;TAITRA&lt;/a&gt; into practice during the show hours to prevent disorders of the show. Minors under age 12 also will be allowed to visit the show.

Survivors of this weekend's airplane crash in &lt;a href="Alaska"&gt;Alaska&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; say they saw the forward cargo door of their &lt;a href="w%3APiper%20Aircraft"&gt;Piper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APiper%20PA-31%20Navajo"&gt;Piper PA-31 Navajo&lt;/a&gt; Chieftain swing open shortly after takeoff. The plane crashed into frigid waters a short distance from the runway, killing six of the ten on board, including the pilot, and leaving the other four hospitalized.

The US &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Transportation%20Safety%20Board"&gt;National Transportation Safety Board&lt;/a&gt; (NTSB) is investigating the accident, and NTSB investigator Clint Johnson said "There have been some &lt;a href="w%3Aaviation%20accidents%20and%20incidents"&gt;incidents and accidents&lt;/a&gt; that did result from the door coming open. We don't know yet if there are similarities." He refused to speculate on accident cause, pointing out that a full investigation would take some time to complete.

The remains of the fuselage have been laid out in a maintenance hangar close to the &lt;a href="w%3AKodiak%20Island"&gt;Kodiak Island&lt;/a&gt; accident site and is scheduled for examination tomorrow pending arrival of an accident investigation representative from Piper, who will provide detailed technical assistance. The nine-passenger complement had chartered the Servant Air plane to fly to &lt;a href="w%3AHomer%2C%20Alaska"&gt;Homer&lt;/a&gt;, and represented maximum capacity for the twin-engined plane.

It appears that the survivors were seated at the rear of the plane. The deceased were identified as pilot Robin Starrett, 50, of Kodiak and five Homer residents - Stefan F. Basargin, 36, Pavel F. Basargin, 30, Zahary F. Martushev, 25, Iosif F. Martushev, 15, and Andrian Reutov, 22. The survivor's names have now also been released; they are Karnely Ivanov, 32, of &lt;a href="w%3AAnchor%20Point"&gt;Anchor Point&lt;/a&gt;, Feodot Basargin, 33, of &lt;a href="w%3AAnchorage"&gt;Anchorage&lt;/a&gt;, Anton Rijkoff, 30, of Anchorage, and Andrean Basargin, 25, of Homer.

There have been two previous cases of Alaskan Piper Navajo crashes confirmed to have been caused by open forward cargo hatches. In April 1990 a compartment opened during takeoff from &lt;a href="w%3ADeadnight"&gt;Deadnight&lt;/a&gt;; this caused separation of an engine cover which proceeded to strike and damage the &lt;a href="w%3Ahorizontal%20stabilizer"&gt;horizontal stabilizer&lt;/a&gt;. No-one was injured.

It was discovered that a vital spring designed to exert pressure and thus keep the door shut was missing; the operator had improvised its own device to shut the door without correctly locking it.

The second crash occurred in May 1996. A &lt;a href="w%3ACape%20Smythe%20Air"&gt;Cape Smythe Air&lt;/a&gt; Services owned-and-operated aircraft attempting takeoff at &lt;a href="w%3APoint%20Hope"&gt;Point Hope&lt;/a&gt; had its forward door unexpectedly open as the nose lifted off. Cargo went through the left propeller, forcing an emergency crash landing on the ice severely injuring two people. 

The pilot had loaded the hold and then visually inspected the door. Under the false impression that it had been secured properly he proceeded to takeoff. He had originally attempted to turn the aircraft around and told the NTSB he had thought that the aircraft should have been able to fly despite the open door, although he appreciated aircraft documentation did not specifically mention such conditions.

Small, local-based Servant Air had been operating the 1979 aircraft since 2004 without any difficulties. As with many such carriers, the pilot is responsible for loading and checking the door. The door is approximately 3 1/2 feet wide and 2 1/2 feet high.

The &lt;a href="w%3APentagon"&gt;Pentagon&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; has released a video tape of an incident where &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iranian&lt;/a&gt; high-speed boats attempted to surround at least three U.S. warships passing through international waters in the &lt;a href="w%3APersian%20Gulf"&gt;Persian Gulf&lt;/a&gt;.

On Monday January 7, a fleet of the Iranian boats charged and then threatened to blow up the U.S. ships. In the video, which was shot from the &lt;a href="w%3AUSS%20Hopper%20%28DDG-70%29"&gt;USS Hopper&lt;/a&gt;, and runs for some four minutes, shows the speedboats racing at the US ships. In the audio, a warning said to come from the Iranians can be heard: "I am coming at you; you will explode." Near the end of the footage, the Americans issue their own warning to change course or become "subject to defensive measures."

Tuesday, U.S. President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; called the actions of the Iranians a "provocative act":

"My message today to the Iranians is they shouldn't have done what they did. It is a dangerous situation. They should not have done it, pure and simple. . . . I don't know what their thinking was, but I'm telling you what my thinking was. I think it was a provocative act," said Bush during a press conference in the &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;'s Rose Garden today.

The boats disappeared a short time later, just as the U.S. ships were preparing to open fire on the vessels.

Iran claims that their troops may not have recognized the ships as being from the U.S. and says that the incident is "normal" for both nations.

"That is something normal that takes place every now and then for each party," said Mohammed Ali Hosseini, a spokesman for the &lt;a href="w%3AForeign%20relations%20of%20Iran"&gt;Foreign ministry&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ATehran%2C%20Iran"&gt;Tehran&lt;/a&gt;.

Further, Iran claims that the footage released by the Pentagon is just a part of a propaganda campaign. "The footage released by the US Navy are file pictures and the audio has been fabricated," &lt;a href="w%3AArmy%20of%20the%20Guardians%20of%20the%20Islamic%20Revolution"&gt;Revolutionary Guard&lt;/a&gt; sources said on Iranian TV.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Will%20Wikimedia%20%26quot%3Brun%20on%20Sun%26quot%3B%3F&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
An internal Wikimedia communiqué was leaked over the weekend. Like many e-mails, the document is a chain of forwards, replies, and attachments. The attached &lt;a href="w%3APortable%20Document%20Format"&gt;Portable Document Format&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) file was from a &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20PowerPoint"&gt;PowerPoint&lt;/a&gt; presentation, entitled "&lt;a href="w%3AWikimedia"&gt;Wikimedia Foundation&lt;/a&gt;: Past, Present, and Future". The presentation is watermarked confidential, do not distribute, and details the Foundation's recent financial, technical, and traffic history, outlines near-term forecasts for all three, and makes suggestions for slightly longer horizons as well. By itself the document led to several inter-connected news stories.

<h2>Wikimedia Foundation approaches donors</h2>

&lt;a href="w%3ASue%20Gardner"&gt;Sue Gardner&lt;/a&gt; was, in part, hired to find innovative routes to secure funding for the Foundation. What is interesting in this case is who she approached, and with whom.

This presentation was used during a meeting with &lt;a href="w%3ASun%20Microsystems"&gt;Sun Microsystems&lt;/a&gt;. Sun has long been a supporter of Wikimedia, and has previously offered hardware and financial support. A loan of a &lt;a href="w%3AUltraSPARC%20T1"&gt;Niagara machine&lt;/a&gt; allowed performance testing, which showed that hardware and software setup was not suitable for the Wikimedia environment which existed at the time, but both Wikimedia's environment and Sun's hardware and software have changed since those tests.

Gardner's delegation included &lt;a href="w%3ARoger%20McNamee"&gt;Roger McNamee&lt;/a&gt;, a technology financier with &lt;a href="w%3AElevation%20Partners"&gt;Elevation Partners&lt;/a&gt; among other connections to &lt;a href="w%3ASilicon%20Valley"&gt;Silicon Valley's&lt;/a&gt; investors and visionaries.

The document does not explain the details of the meeting, but mentions donation proposals for short term and long term. "In general, I don't want to have a conversation with the media (even friendly media!) about meetings we have with other organizations, until and unless there is something worth talking about," Ms Gardner replied to an e-mail inquiry regarding the presentation.

<h2>Mediawiki technology</h2>

The software which underpins the Foundation's projects is constantly being developed, both from within and from third parties. Mediawiki is an open source software package, one with a significant share in its market; efforts to add functionality often have their own development projects and timelines. The presentation outlined some of these efforts and their respective timelines. 

<ul>
BULLET::::- Wiki-to-print is currently in testing, and is expected to deploy February to March, 2008
BULLET::::- Flagged revisions is currently in testing, and is expected to deploy before June, 2008
BULLET::::- Collaborative video editing is currently in testing, and is expected to deploy initially perhaps in October 2008

</ul>
Other technologies were also shown in the presentation, but these specific examples show some of the types of projects and their ambitious initial completion dates.

<h3>Kaltura collaborative video</h3>

Some of these technologies are joint ventures with commercial entities, such as the "&lt;a href="w%3AKaltura"&gt;Kaltura&lt;/a&gt; widget"extension designed to support collaborative video on the Mediawiki platform. The code for this project is promised to be open sourced, and the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.kaltura.com/devwiki/index.php/Main_Page"&gt;main page of the Kaltura site&lt;/a&gt; has a link to sourceforge, but the http://sourceforge.net/projects/kaltura/ cvs is currently empty though it is marked to be GPL. An inquiry into the current output of the extension finds it is embeding a flash object into the output. The special page allowing video editing was not operational after creating a user account (8 Jan 2008). The Wikimedia Foundation is expected to release an announcement regarding this project on January 14, however the current Kaltura extension, which requires proprietary flash and Kaltura's proprietary server, won't be used on Wikimedia sites.

"The Wikimedia Foundation is strongly committed to open source, open formats, sustainability, and privacy," said , Wikimedia Foundations Chief Technical Officer. "We're excited to see Kaltura working towards making their collaborative video editing system open source and more compatible with the open world, and look forward to further work in that area. The initial version of Kaltura's extension for MediaWiki is an early demonstration, and will not be used on Wikimedia's web sites."

An enthusiastic version of what was intended to be a joint announcement appeared for a time on the Kaltura website. At 13:29 on January 8, the page read, "♡❤The Wikimedia Foundation, and Kaltura, Inc. announced on _____ that the companies have joined forces to bring rich-media collaboration to Wikipedia. With the launch of this joint venture, users have been invited to test new functionality that will enable Wikipedia articles to include collaboratively created video, audio, animations, and slideshows as well as text and images. You are invited to experiment with this functionality at this Wiki, as well as at wikiducator.org/____.♡❤"

<h3>Flagged revisions</h3>

Other projects have been initiated from within the Wikimedia communities. The extension developed from the German Wikipedia community's desire to have an approved version of an article being the default view, with registered editors able to choose whether to see the default view or the most recent revision. The code is primarily developed and maintained by Aaron Schulz and Joerg Baach on Wikimedia's SVN server. &lt;a href="http%3A//quality.wikimedia.org"&gt;Quality.wikimedia.org&lt;/a&gt; and the external site &lt;a href="http%3A//wikixp.org/qa/"&gt;wikixp.org/qa&lt;/a&gt; are involved in testing the extension and the concept implementation.

Flagged revisions allow the community to display versions of an article which have not been vandalised and do not contain misinformation. It is a part of several efforts to improve the quality of Wikipedia articles, spearheaded by the German Wikipedia. The German model is two-tiered, with a subset of users being able to select a "sighted version" or a "validated version". The former have been examined primarily for vandalism and simple accuracy, while the latter would involve an in-depth review of the article's content and quality.

The initial 1.0 release of the extension was in the first half of 2007, and it continues under active development as testing at the beta stages goes forward. Community models for its implementation have not yet been finalized, and they would be needed for every project and language.

<h2>Forecasts and financials</h2>

In addition to discussing technical forecasts, future expenditures were given general forecasts and a breakdown of salary growth were presented based on pre-audit details.

Costs between June 2007 and June 2008 were predicted to double, from &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;2,650,000 to US$5,700,000 (normalized). The largest growth is expected in salaries as the Foundation undergoes re-organization and fills long-vacant positions, tripling the 2007 payroll.

Florence Nibart-Devouard, current Chair of the Board of Trustees of the Wikimedia Foundation, expressed pleasure at discovering the projections. "We have not [had] a complete financial picture for some time. It was requested of Carolyn while she was employed with us[, and] it was one of the priorities for Sue Gardner to give quarterly updates, but these did not happen yet because there is so much to do," she said during a phone interview on 7 Jan. "… The board did not request these projections, but I think it should be a good idea if they were informed of them. Especially when we prepare next year's budget, in April or May."

The Foundation's Chief Operations Officer, Carolyn Doran, resigned in July 2007. Although Ms Gardner was hired in July, Board member , former treasurer, provided financial information to the board through much of 2007.

To: Jonathan Schwartz &lt;edited&gt;, Greg Papadopoulos &lt;edited&gt;
Cc: Roger McNamee &lt;edited&gt;, Erik Möller &lt;edited&gt;
Hi Jonathan &amp; Greg,

This is just a quick note to say thanks so much for meeting with Roger,
Erik &amp; me in December. We really appreciate it - hope you both had good
holidays afterwards.

In the meeting, we talked about the possibility of Sun making a major
contribution to Wikimedia's hosting, so that you could reinforce your
position as open source leaders by association with us in your
marketing. We think this makes sense, and would love to make it work.

Next steps. Erik will pull together a wishlist, which we will send to
you by the end of January – let's say January 28. The list will likely
come in two versions: one focusing on our immediate needs and our
preferences in terms of hardware and software, and one laying out a
"Wikimedia runs on Sun" scenario in which we fully switch over, with
your help, to an integrated Sun environment. They will target different
scales, let's say about $1M in hardware vs. $5M in
hardware/software/support.

Please let us know if any of this is contrary to what you remember, or
if you want us to refine/revise anything. Otherwise, you'll hear from us
in about three weeks.

Thanks,
Sue

<h1>Lemoine Suggests: investigations from a Wikimedia Foundation news leak/Email Sue Gardner January 7, 2008 7:53:44 PM PST</h1>
I figure this will be easiest if we remain on a single e-mail thread then.

Sure, that's fine. So I will keep it all here.

I've been collecting documentation regarding the Wikimedia Foundation's recent fundraising efforts for a news article on Wikinews (No doubt, Sue, Erik has informed you I left the project, as well as curtailed my volunteer involvement with WMF, upon his election to the Board of Trustees. For your benefit, Erik, I am tentatively doing some minor editing and rc-patrol on en.wn) I believe I have a reasonably complete picture of preliminary results.

Great: let me know if you have any questions or need anything confirmed. You can also, obviously, feel free to speak with Erik. Please be aware also that the "Contributions summary" page isn't necessarily the full picture: it doesn't include all donations sources. So if you want to use totals for your story, you should confirm them with me or Erik to ensure they're complete.
But I do have a number of questions based on what I've learned.

1. A $250k donation, earmarked for hardware. I would appreciate knowing who made the donation, when, and (if possible) why. I'd love to know if the WMF has determined how this donation will be used.

The 250K is coming from a recently-established private foundation that has educational goals similar to ours: they admire what we're doing and want to support us, so they phoned the office and offered to make a contribution. (I'm not sure if it matters for your story, but the 250K is actually unrelated to the online fundraiser, and is not included in the fundraiser totals. Also, it may be worth noting that we have not received the money yet. This is totally fine: these things always take a while.)

After that call, I consulted with the tech team, and we decided to use the money to buy core database servers in our Florida cluster. We had intended to buy the servers anyway: this donation will simply cover most/all of the cost. 
I am happy to tell you the basic story, but I don't want to publicly give the name of the organization that's offering us the money: I don't have their permission to do that. They might be fine with it: who knows. I just am not comfortable making that decision for them.

2. A $500k donation. I would appreciate knowing who made the donation, when, and (if possible) why. I'd also like to know if there were any restrictions placed on this donation, like the previous one was dedicated to hardware purchases.
You may already know that our default position is to give donors anonymity unless they specifically say it's okay to use their names. Lots of donors, particularly those who are giving large amounts, prefer to remain anonymous, and I think it's only fair to respect that. In this instance, I don't have permission to give the donor's name: sorry.

I do not know specifically why this donor made the contribution: clearly they wanted to support our work, but I don't know anything more specific than that. And no, there were no restrictions put on the donation.

3. A presentation was made to Sun Microsystems by yourselves, plus Roger McNamee in December. This presentation was at least partially created on November 20th and 21st, and has a large amount of information in it regarding recent past, present, and near-term financial, technical, and traffic. I have at least several questions regarding this presentation, including:
3.a When did the meeting with Sun Microsystems take place, and with whom did you meet?
3.b Assuming the donations proposals are eventually worked out and all parties are able to reach agreement, will the WMF move to a proprietary server network?
3.c One of the technical advances discussed in the proposal is collaborative video. Researching this I discovered a mediawiki site within Kaltura which seemed to be very closely related. Is this connection correct?

In general, I don't want to have a conversation with the media (even friendly media!) about meetings we have with other organizations, until and unless there is something worth talking about. We have lots of provisional conversations with lots of different organizations and people, which don't necessarily imply anything about future plans or possibilities. So as a general practice, I would never comment on a specific meeting or presentation.

Beyond that, as I'm sure you know, the Wikimedia Foundation is committed to running on an infrastructure powered by open source and open standards. We have no plans to change that.

Amgine, let me know if there's any more information I can give you. I'm going to be away from the computer for a couple of hours; back later tonight and obviously tomorrow as well.

Thanks for your interest, and best regards.
Sue
I should very much like to know answers to these and other questions, and will be in irc://freenode.net/Wikinews-en for some hours yet this evening if that would speed the process.

Best regards,

Amgine

Hi Amgine,

I'd be happy to talk with Wikinews about the fundraiser - although it would be great if you could wait a few days; we are collating all the donations right now, and don't yet have final totals. I'm CCing Erik so he can jump in &amp; say when we will.

Do you want to do it by e-mail? If so, I can start answering questions now, and fill in the blanks when I get the last bits of info.

Let me know what you think - thanks,
Sue

Hi!
This is Amgine at en.Wikinews. I'm working on a story involving the Wikimedia Foundation, especially covering the recently ended Fundraiser drive. I'm looking for the opportunity to interview Sue Gardner, hopefully in the early part of this week. I can be reached most easily by cell phone, &lt;edited&gt;, or home phone &lt;edited&gt;, or IRC (check irc://freenode.net/Wikinews-en). I will happily call anywhere for the chance to conduct the interview, or any other venue which would be most convenient.
Best regards,

<h1>Canupa Gluha Mani speaks about Lakota Oyate, Lakota freedom</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Canupa%20Gluha%20Mani%20speaks%20about%20Lakota%20Oyate%2C%20Lakota%20freedom&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

It's now been three weeks since the four-person &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20of%20Lakotah"&gt;Lakota Freedom Delegation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; declared that the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALakota%20people"&gt;Lakota people&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; were withdrawing from their treaties with the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and, though small, the movement still proves controversial: two U.S.-recognized Lakota tribal governments have rejected the Delegation's authority outright with at least one tribe stating it will consider the Delegation's, now Lakota Oyate's, proposal. The rest of the tribes have remained silent.

The central figure the movement has been Canupa Gluha Mani, a longtime activist whose tactics have led repeatedly to his arrest and imprisonment — most recently in June 2007, when Canupa Gluha Mani was one of six arrested who participated in blockading a road in &lt;a href="Nebraska"&gt;Nebraska&lt;/a&gt; to keep outside alcohol from entering his &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADry%20county"&gt;dry reservation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; where it is banned. ♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ talked to Canupa Gluha Mani about the movement and Lakota Oyate in an exclusive interview.

Also called Duane Martin Sr, Canupa Gluha Mani prefers to be referred to as just that, "Canupa Gluha Mani"; it means "He walks as he protects the pipe", though much of the meaning is lost in translation between English and the delicately-nuanced Lakota language. Canupa Gluha Mani prefers to speak in this, his native tongue &amp;mdash; he "hates" that the English language has become the everyday language of the Lakota, and decries the extinction of many indigenous American languages &amp;mdash; but uses English fluently and earthily.

Canupa Gluha Mani talked about the Cante Tenza, the Strong Heart Warrior Society, which he heads and which forms the paramilitary force of Lakotah. The society, an ♡❤okolakiciye♡❤ or warrior society, originated in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABlack%20Hills"&gt;Black Hills&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . He told the following story: Four warriors in the hills ran across a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acoyote"&gt;coyote&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and gave it chase. And as the coyote ran he turned into a Lakota man, and in his changing the man left four objects: a rattle, a drum, a lance, and a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Atomahawk"&gt;tomahawk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with which the Lakota people could be defended. Canupa Gluha Mani is a warrior leader, and his position with relation to the treaty council which traditionally governs the Lakota is "whip-man", loosely "sergeant at arms" &amp;mdash; that is, he enforces order and decorum when passions grow heated during tribal discussions.

The authority of the Lakota Freedom Delegation, he says, comes not from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABureau%20of%20Indian%20Affairs"&gt;BIA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -recognized governments but rather from the "people who understand treaties", i.e. the treaty council, from among the Seven Sister Bands of the Lakota. This traditional government is based on the idea of "staying quiet and listening to the people who have answers", the "itacans" or expert headmen.

Canupa Gluha Mani also endorsed Naomi Archer, who has acted as Lakota Oyate's liaison; indeed, as the Lakota Freedom Delegation prepared its trip to Washington DC he called in Naomi Archer, who though of non-native extraction is his adopted sister and a fellow Cante Tenza member, to handle media support. "I support the understandings of what she's saying", he said, referring to a previous interview with Archer which revealed an apparent split between &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARussell%20Means"&gt;Russell Means&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and other members of the Lakota Freedom Delegation. "She as an individual has integrity." However, the previous interview missed nuances and the perceived gap between Lakota Oyate and Russell Means' Republic of Lakota is not so great. "There's no division here...it's communication, that's all. We can always get past this."

With regard to Russell Means, who has declared himself Chief Facilitator of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20of%20Lakotah"&gt;Republic of Lakotah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , he said, "I've worked with my uncle Russell Means in positive venues. And I'm still behind him, I have love for him;" He emphasized the familial bond between himelf and Means, noting that Means had adopted him as a nephew. However, "the Lakota have to be recognized." It was "genocide", he said, that of all the races of humanity, American Indians are not represented at the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;.

On the subject of Lakota activist Alfred Bone Shirt, who organized the Lakota Oyate's first freedom celebration and information meeting on Saturday, 5 January but has since made comments attacking the legitimacy of Canupa Gluha Mani, Naomi Archer and Lakota Oyate, Canupa Gluha Mani had this to say. "I have nothing to do with Mr Bone Shirt, nothing against him". He also noted that Lakota Oyate had respected Bone Shirt's call to take down invitations for donations, but expressed a wish that Mr Bone Shirt would make the same call to any other website inviting donations to Lakotah.

The traditional decision making process within the Lakota, he said, was informal discussions among the women of the Lakota rather than pronouncements and declarations. Ideas like western forms of government &amp;mdash; referencing the "Republic" &amp;mdash; and the use of the English language were part of the reason for both the misunderstanding of the dispute between Russell Means and Canupa Gluha Mani and the Lakota's problems: "It's hard for Indian people to adapt to this modern lifestyle...It's white teaching that cause Indian problem...leave us alone...This country has not learned a thing about its own First Nations people."

US governing of Lakota has led directly to the economic and social decline of the Lakotah people, he argues. Canupa Gluha Mani noted that the life expectancy for Lakota men is only 44, and that alcohol and drug use are epidemic, as are infectious diseases such as tuberculosis. But revival of the Lakota has to be not just economic to improve the circumstances of the people, but cultural too: "Our language is at stake right now" but the US government-backed institutions like the Tribal Police are just "the second coming of the white man's cavalry".

Canupa Gluha Mani is on record as saying in a previous interview that "we'll probably get killed for" withdrawing from the United States. Now, he is tight-lipped on the future, and when asked about the possibility of a confrontation with the US will only say that "anything's plausible." 

And if the United States government leaves the Lakota alone? "Then we can take our practices forward in good will." Canupa Gluha Mani, who is married to a woman of European descent, says that the traditional American Indian lifestyle can coexist with the western lifestyle, but "every wound has to heal". "We can be self-sufficient. We can govern ourselves." Having withdrawn from the outstanding treaties with the United States, will Lakota Oyate make a new arrangement with Washington? "That has yet to be exonerated." Lakotah continues to seek international recognition; although no country has declared recognition for Lakotah, he is "confident with the &lt;a href="Bolivia"&gt;Bolivia&lt;/a&gt;ns" and also noted a positive response from the "&lt;a href="Bulgaria"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt;n freedom fighters" pressuring the US to recognize Lakota independence.

Canupa Gluha Mani then addressed the Lakota people directly. "What needs to get out there is, I love my people...This is your dream come true. That's what the symbolic meaning of Lakotah is. It's called freedom. ♡❤Hoka hay.♡❤"

Major city roads across &lt;a href="North%20America"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt; are suffering from an early surge in &lt;a href="w%3Apothole"&gt;pothole&lt;/a&gt;s due to the dramatic freezes and thaws this month, some several feet across and inches deep. The potholes are caused by water seeping into cracks during warm weather, and pushing concrete apart when it freezes. Traffic erodes chunks of concrete from the cracks to form holes that continuously grow larger.

While car repair shops are experiencing a boom in business, city budgets are being hit with the costs of patching potholes. Thierry Larivée, an infrastructure spokesman in &lt;a href="w%3AMontreal"&gt;Montréal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, says about 20 pothole patrols are working throughout the city. They are expected to continue work until at least Friday.

Craig Bryson, spokesman for the Road Commission for &lt;a href="w%3AOakland%20County%2C%20Michigan"&gt;Oakland County&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Michigan"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, reports problems on unpaved roads as well. "The warmer weather is also playing havoc with gravel roads; the top layer of dirt thaws, but remains frozen about 10 inches below the surface. Surface water has no place to go. This creates a rutted, soupy road, especially in low-lying areas."

&lt;a href="w%3AEnvironment%20Canada"&gt;Environment Canada&lt;/a&gt; meteorologist René Héroux attributes the unseasonable thaw to warm winds from the southwest. Environment Canada predicts a new cold front on Thursday.

A bid made by &lt;a href="w%3ASingapore%20Airlines"&gt;Singapore Airlines&lt;/a&gt; for a 24% stake in &lt;a href="w%3AChina%20Eastern%20Airlines"&gt;China Eastern Airlines&lt;/a&gt; was turned down by minority shareholders.

Talks about a sale started in March 2007 when Singapore Airlines and China Eastern started negotiations about a possible deal. According to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AForbes"&gt;Forbes&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ the deal would have helped China Eastern's earnings and accelerate the consolidation and would have improved the market position of China's third-largest airline. Talks went on throughout the year and both companies suspended trading of their shares on May 21, 2007, according to a ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAgence%20France-Presse"&gt;AFP&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ press release.

The vote took place at a shareholder meeting in Shanghai, People's Republic of China. According to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AFT.com"&gt;Financial Times Online&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, the blocking of the SA bid by minority shareholders is bad news for China Eastern Airlines managers, who were and still are in full support of Singapore Airlines, which the Singaporean government owns a 55% stake in via &lt;a href="w%3ATemasek%20Holdings"&gt;Temasek Holdings&lt;/a&gt;.

♡❤Financial Times Online♡❤ says this is most likely due to the fact that Air China not having made any formal bids yet, instead creating many media rumors about a possible purchase. The bid by Air China, that is likely to be larger than that of Singapore Airlines, may be supported by &lt;a href="w%3ACathay%20Pacific"&gt;Cathay Pacific&lt;/a&gt;, who are in a cross-shareholding relationship with &lt;a href="w%3AChina%20National%20Aviation%20Corporation"&gt;China National Aviation Corp.&lt;/a&gt;, the parent company of Air China.

The &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Liberation%20Army"&gt;People's Liberation Army&lt;/a&gt; (PLA) of &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; has a plan to seize &lt;a href="North%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;'s nuclear weapons if it becomes necessary, says a report by &lt;a href="w%3ACenter%20for%20Strategic%20and%20International%20Studies"&gt;Center for Strategic and International Studies&lt;/a&gt; (CSIS), a &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href="w%3Athink%20tank"&gt;think tank&lt;/a&gt;.

CSIS experts have been talking to Chinese &lt;a href="w%3AMilitary%20researcher"&gt;military researchers&lt;/a&gt;, who claimed that in the case of instability in neighboring &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;, the Chinese military would be dispatched to obtain the nuclear weapons developed by North Korea over the past years. The report says that in such a case, China would try to coordinate its efforts with the international community, primarily the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;. However, the report goes on to state that China would intervene earlier if "the international community did not react in a timely manner as the internal order in North Korea deteriorated rapidly".

Jiang Yu, a spokeswomen for the &lt;a href="w%3AForeign%20Ministry%20of%20the%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;Foreign Ministry of the People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; said she was unaware of such plans, but did not deny the existence of such a plan. 

Richard Spencer of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Daily%20Telegraph"&gt;The Daily Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ says the plan indicates a major change in attitude of the Chinese government towards its neighbor. China is one of the five nations on the &lt;a href="w%3AUN%20Security%20Council"&gt;UN Security Council&lt;/a&gt; and a legitimate &lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20states%20with%20nuclear%20weapons"&gt;nuclear power&lt;/a&gt; in accordance with the &lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20Non-Proliferation%20Treaty"&gt;Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty&lt;/a&gt; of 1968.

&lt;a href="w%3AYemen"&gt;Yemen&lt;/a&gt;'s Abdul-Karim Qasem, who creates &lt;a href="w%3Acrossword"&gt;crosswords&lt;/a&gt; for publications like ♡❤al-Arabi♡❤ magazine and the newspaper ♡❤al-Moshahad♡❤, has created a puzzle more than 3 times larger than the current recognized record holder.

Qasem's puzzle, currently in the initial stages of review with the &lt;a href="w%3AGuinness%20World%20Records"&gt;Guinness World Records&lt;/a&gt;, includes 320,500 "puzzle squares", easily topping the previous high of 91,000 squares. The accompanying book of clues for the puzzle is 800,720 words long.

Qasem learned of the previous record when visiting the Guinness World Records website in 2000. He took the next seven years to research unique information for the puzzle, from in various international books and websites. "I did not want my information to be repeated," he told the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AYemen%20Observer"&gt;Yemen Observer&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

He told the ♡❤Observer♡❤ that, during the seven years, he ignored his children's "simple and serious needs", and bought supplies for the project with funds reserved for basic family needs.

The man asked the local authorities in &lt;a href="w%3AIbb%20Governorate"&gt;Ibb&lt;/a&gt; for support, but was met with indifference. However, when he visited the &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20Yemen"&gt;Presidential Office&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASana%27a"&gt;Sana'a&lt;/a&gt;, President &lt;a href="w%3AAli%20Abdullah%20Saleh"&gt;Ali Abdullah Saleh&lt;/a&gt; immediately asked the Ministry of Culture to "support [him] in any way [he] needed."

Finding ballpoint pen ink wasn't clear enough on his paper, Qasem filled his pens with a medicine meant for curing simple burns. Despite this effort, his once "very good" eyesight has weakened, forcing him to wear glasses. His back also hurts from the experience, and any quick movement hurts him to the extent that he is bedridden for the next two days.

Guinness' press staff told Wikinews that the organization has no records for this man's name, but say he may simply be too early in the record confirmation process to be registered.

Realising how visual a medium tattooing is, &lt;a href="w%3Atattoo"&gt;tattoo&lt;/a&gt; artist Kat Von D of TV series ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALA%20Ink"&gt;LA Ink&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ set a world record while raising funds to fight childhood blindness. In 24 hours, Von D tattooed 400 people with an "&lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles"&gt;LA&lt;/a&gt;" logo, in her &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Hollywood"&gt;West Hollywood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; tattoo shop.

The December event at High Voltage Tattoo drew 1000 people in line, although only 400 could get the image emblazoned on them, for a $20 donation. Most learned of the event through her MySpace profile. In all, the funds raised will help 32,000 children's eyesight, through Vitamin Angels.

Vitamin Angels is the only organization in the world solely dedicated to eradicating vitamin A definciency among children, with the goal of warding off youth blindness by &lt;a href="w%3A2020"&gt;2020&lt;/a&gt;. The year 2020 is chosen because perfect vision is described as "&lt;a href="w%3AVisual_acuity"&gt;20/20&lt;/a&gt;".

First in line at the event was Jose Flores, who had camped out in front of the store since 7:15 the previous evening. Doors didn't open until 10 am, and Flores didn't get the tattoo until Von D was done with her friends and family, including internet celebrity &lt;a href="w%3AJeffree%20Star"&gt;Jeffree Star&lt;/a&gt;.

A Guinness World Records official was scheduled to attend, but was caught in a snow storm.

Katherine Von Drachenberg told the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20Times"&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that, as a teenager, she "be at the mall and parents would grab their kids and be like, 'Honey!' It was like that scene in ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3APretty%20Woman"&gt;Pretty Woman&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, where the women on &lt;a href="w%3ARodeo%20Drive"&gt;Rodeo Drive&lt;/a&gt; think &lt;a href="w%3AJulia%20Roberts"&gt;Julia Roberts&lt;/a&gt; is going to shoplift. Now people just come up to me more out of curiosity -- everyone from grandmas to soccer moms."

The record setting event was filmed for ♡❤LA Ink♡❤, a series that airs Tuesday nights on &lt;a href="w%3ATLC"&gt;TLC&lt;/a&gt; in the United States. The series is a spin-off of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMiami%20Ink"&gt;Miami Ink&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, a series featuring Von D's previous place of employ, before she set off on her own.

The series' second season started last night, however that particular episode will air March 4.

Lou Taylor went on the NBC morning show to say that when they "extended trust" to "Dr. Phil", as he's known, it was as a medical professional and not as a television personality. They say he was to keep the matters private.

McGraw was "not invited to make this part of the public display, part of the media," said Taylor on behalf of father Jamie Spears and mother &lt;a href="w%3ALynne%20Spears"&gt;Lynne Spears&lt;/a&gt;.

Taylor was responding to McGraw realizing a statement about Spears, and then appearing for an interview on the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AEntertainment%20Tonight"&gt;Entertainment Tonight&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ entertainment news program. McGraw's statement read:

Originally it was rumored that the family would appear on ♡❤Dr. Phil♡❤ for one of the news headline-based special episodes. Taylor also told interviewer &lt;a href="w%3AMeredith%20Viera"&gt;Meredith Viera&lt;/a&gt; that the family had never discussed such plans. They had only hired McGraw to talk privately to Spears, one of "many professionals and many resources surrounding the family."

According to Taylor, the Spears parents, along with pregnant daughter &lt;a href="w%3AJamie%20Lynn%20Spears"&gt;Jamie Lynn&lt;/a&gt; "are people who love their daughter, and know what's going on," praying every day for her well-being. They are broken hearted regarding "the morbidity of people watching" the breakdown.

Spears was hospitalized after being deemed a safety risk to herself, but released within 24 hours, instead of the 72 hour norm.

For the past few months, National Geographic Kids (NGK) has been collecting used running shoes from across the United States, in hopes of creating the world's longest chain of shoes.

The record attempt organizers welcome shoes of any brand, any shapes, and any size, so long as they have laces and are meant for humans.

The collected shoes will be sorted afterwards, and Nike Reuse-A-Shoe program will take and recycle all the athletic shoes. Nike, which also donates its unusable material to the program, creates rubber surfaces for basketball and tennis courts, soccer fields, and running tracks.

Donations of shoes have been received from actress &lt;a href="w%3ACameron%20Diaz"&gt;Cameron Diaz&lt;/a&gt;, and US Women's Soccer team players Shannon Boxx, Angela Hucles, Carli Lloyd, Lindsay Tarpley, and Cat Whitehill.

NGK, a magazine by the National Geographic Society, says that 2000 to 2500 athletic shoes contain enough material to build a basketball surface.

Shoes can be sent before January 22, 2008 to:

Nike has disposal locations for shoes in Nike stores around the US, Canada, the U.K., Netherlands, Germany, Australia, and Japan. Select athletic clubs, schools and colleges also participate in "Nike Grind".

It has been announced that the global premiere of the &lt;a href="Lordi"&gt;Lordi&lt;/a&gt; horror movie will be on February 8 in &lt;a href="w%3AOulu"&gt;Oulu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Finland"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt;. Lordi, a Finnish theatrical &lt;a href="w%3Ahard%20rock"&gt;hard rock&lt;/a&gt; band, will also perform at the premiere.

The event will take place at the &lt;a href="w%3AOulun%20Energia%20Areena"&gt;Oulun Energia Areena&lt;/a&gt;, home of the &lt;a href="w%3AOulun%20K%C3%A4rp%C3%A4t"&gt;Oulun Kärpät&lt;/a&gt;, a team in the &lt;a href="w%3ASM-liiga"&gt;SM-liiga&lt;/a&gt;, the Finnish National &lt;a href="w%3Aice%20hockey"&gt;Hockey&lt;/a&gt; League. The premiere will be the nation's largest, and is a co-operative measure by Northern Film, Media Foundation POEM and Oulun Kärpät.

The film is based on an original concept by director &lt;a href="w%3APete%20Riski"&gt;Pete Riski&lt;/a&gt;, who directed all Lordi music videos, and the band's frontman and lead vocalist. Made in &lt;a href="w%3AEnglish%20language"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; cast except for the band, Lordi appear in their famous monster costumes playing a group of monsters terrorising a group of people trapped in a hospital. &lt;a href="w%3ABlabbermouth"&gt;Blabbermouth&lt;/a&gt; reports that the film is expected to become an international success.

The end credits of the movie will feature the Lordi song ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABeast%20Loose%20in%20Paradise"&gt;Beast Loose in Paradise&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, which was released as a single late last month.

Riski directed the film, which was produced by &lt;a href="w%3AMarkus%20Selin"&gt;Markus Selin&lt;/a&gt; and written by &lt;a href="w%3APekka%20Lehtosaari"&gt;Pekka Lehtosaari&lt;/a&gt;. The project started after an interview with Lordi's vocalist in which he suggested Selin contact him over an idea he had had for a film. &lt;a href="w%3ASolar%20Films"&gt;Solar Films&lt;/a&gt; produced the film in co-operation with Northern Film, Media Foundation POEM and the North Finland Film Commission.

Oulu is considered a good choice for the premiere, as it has a reputation amongst Finns as the "film-friendly town up north" and because Dark Floors was filmed there over the course of summer 2007. 5,000 people are expected to attend the premiere and accompanying show. Tickets became available today at www.Lippupalvelu.fi.

The concept for Lordi was conceived in 1992, however, the band wasn't officially formed until 1996 by Tomi Putaansuu. Lordi won the &lt;a href="w%3AEurovision%20Song%20Contest%202006"&gt;2006 Eurovision Song Contest&lt;/a&gt; with a record 292 points, giving Finland its first ever victory.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Apple%20to%20lower%20UK%20iTunes%20prices&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Commission"&gt;European Commission&lt;/a&gt; has forced &lt;a href="w%3AApple"&gt;Apple Inc.&lt;/a&gt; to lower its prices for media in its &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AiTunes"&gt;iTunes store&lt;/a&gt;, Apple's online media shop. The change in policy will occur within the next six months, Apple announced this morning.

Apple is the producer of the world's most-sold &lt;a href="w%3AMP3%20Player"&gt;MP3 Player&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AiPod"&gt;iPod&lt;/a&gt; and launched the iTunes Music Store, a online music store, on April 28, 2003. The store was renamed to iTunes Store in 2006, as Apple began selling other media apart from music, such as feature-length movies. Since its launch the store has sold more than 3 billion songs. At the moment songs are sold for &lt;a href="w%3APound%20sterling"&gt;£&lt;/a&gt;0.79 per song and £7.99 per album which after the price cut will on average be reduced to £0.74 and £7.48 to match the EU prices of &lt;a href="w%3AEuro"&gt;€&lt;/a&gt;0.99 and €9.99, according to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ATimes%20Online"&gt;Times Online&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

The price decrease follows an investigation by the European Commission due to Apple charging customers in the UK up to 10% more than in other EU countries. According to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Register"&gt;The Register&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, Apple will be demanding that the record labels lower their prices in the UK in respect to this forced price cut.

The European Commission welcomed Apple's announcement and in a reaction to the news &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Commissioner%20for%20Competition"&gt;European Commissioner for Competition&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ANeelie%20Kroes"&gt;Neelie Kroes&lt;/a&gt; said "the Commission is very much in favour of solutions which allow consumers to benefit from a truly &lt;a href="w%3ASingle%20market"&gt;Single Market&lt;/a&gt; for music downloads."

Lam Luong, a 37 year old shrimp fisherman from Irvington, &lt;a href="w%3ABayou%20La%20Batre"&gt;Bayou La Batre&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Alabama"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, has confessed to throwing his four children off an 80 feet high bridge after a fight with his wife the day before. Police have charged Luong with 4 counts of &lt;a href="w%3Acapital%20murder"&gt;capital murder&lt;/a&gt;.

Family members and friends told &lt;a href="w%3AFox%20News"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt; that the couple had been fighting over several things, including Luong's girlfriend, on Sunday evening and Monday morning. Luong later drove off with his four children, whom he reported missing to the police and claimed he had left them with his girlfriend who lives in a hotel. Police however became suspicious due to "holes in his story" and he later changed his story. The &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; say that the authorities believe that &lt;a href="w%3ADauphin%20Island%20Bridge"&gt;Dauphin Island Bridge&lt;/a&gt; is where Luong threw the four children, of which he was the biological father of three, into the water.

Initially the family had feared that Luong had traded his children to fund a drug habit. Luong's wife, Ngoc Phan, is at the family home which they shared with her mother. She was not available to comment to the media, but other family members said that they still have hope that the children are alive.

Police and other authorities are using divers, dogs and helicopters to search for the bodies in a 100-square-mile area with a total of 70 people on the case. The search had to be called off on Wednesday due to fog. Luong is scheduled to appear in court on Thursday January 10, 2008.

According to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Geological%20Survey"&gt;United States Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt; (USGS), a preliminary &lt;a href="w%3AMoment%20magnitude%20scale"&gt;magnitude&lt;/a&gt; 6.4 &lt;a href="w%3Aearthquake"&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt; has struck off the coast of &lt;a href="Oregon"&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.

The quake struck at 01:37 (UTC) and its &lt;a href="w%3Aepicenter"&gt;epicenter&lt;/a&gt; was located 242 kilometers (151 miles) west, northwest of &lt;a href="w%3ABarview%2C%20Oregon"&gt;Barview&lt;/a&gt;. It registered at a depth of 10 k.m. (6.2 miles).

So far there are no reports of damage, injuries or deaths and no &lt;a href="w%3Atsunami"&gt;tsunami&lt;/a&gt; warning has been issued, but small waves could be locally generated by any possible landslides.

"The magnitude is such that a tsunami is ♡❤not♡❤ expected. However, in coastal areas of intense shaking, locally generated tsunamis can be triggered by underwater landslides," said the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Oceanic%20and%20Atmospheric%20Administration"&gt;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Tsunami%20Warning%20Center"&gt;Pacific Tsunami Warning Center&lt;/a&gt; in a statement on its website. No further messages will be generated it adds.

Firefighters in &lt;a href="w%3ABandon%2C%20Oregon"&gt;Bandon&lt;/a&gt; report that they didn't even feel the tremor and police say that no one has yet called to report any quake related incidents. Bandon is also located within 150 miles of the quake's epicenter.

Several &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; troops who received blood transfusions from &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; emergency front-line donors face the risk of infectious diseases such as &lt;a href="w%3AAIDS"&gt;AIDS&lt;/a&gt;, the Ministry of Defence confirmed, but said risk of infection was low.

Eighteen troops who fought and were wounded in &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; are being tested for &lt;a href="w%3AHIV"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href="w%3AChagas%20disease"&gt;Chagas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHepatitis%20B%20virus"&gt;Hepatitis B&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHuman%20T-lymphotropic%20virus"&gt;HTLV&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASyphilis"&gt;Syphilis&lt;/a&gt;.

The British military says that the unscreened transfusions were needed to keep the troops alive when they were receiving emergency treatment for their wounds.

The U.S. says that all of the donors have since been found not to be infected with HIV or hepatitis B, but does say that the donors did not receive the proper testing that is required for donating blood.

"These 18 service personnel would almost certainly have died without receiving an emergency blood transfusion at the front line. We are working with the appropriate health authorities to do all that we can to test and reassure the people involved. We continue to do all that we can to support them and their families through this uncertain time," said British Defense Minister, &lt;a href="w%3ADerek%20Twigg"&gt;Derek Twigg&lt;/a&gt;.

The death of longtime &lt;a href="Los%20Angeles"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; civic personality and honorary mayor &lt;a href="w%3AJohnny%20Grant"&gt;Johnny Grant&lt;/a&gt;, who often presided at the installation of new stars at the &lt;a href="w%3AHollywood%20Walk%20of%20Fame"&gt;Hollywood Walk of Fame&lt;/a&gt;, has been reported. He was 84.

Grant, who had lived at the &lt;a href="w%3ARoosevelt%20Hotel%20%28Hollywood%29"&gt;Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel&lt;/a&gt;, was found dead in his bed by members of his staff around 7:00pm Wednesday evening. Police say he died from a natural cause.

"He was supposed to appear at some kind of function and they checked on him and found he passed away on his bed," said &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20Police%20Department"&gt;LAPD&lt;/a&gt; spokesman, Officer Jason Lee.

Al-Manar now can be viewed in &lt;a href="Asia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="Middle%20East"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt;, and most of &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;, a blow to Israel who is trying to fight Hezbollah. Many fear this will increase support and recruiting for Hezbollah, which the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, Israel and some other countries consider a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aterrorist%20organization"&gt;terrorist organization&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Thaicom considers Al-Manar programming as "news and entertainment."

Al-Manar was designated a 'terrorist entity', and banned by the United States in December 2004. It has also been banned by &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, and has run into some service and license problems abroad, making it unavailable in the &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="South%20America"&gt;South America&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; while it has not officially been banned in any of these regions.

The station was launched by Hezbollah in 1991 with the help of &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iranian&lt;/a&gt; funds. By 2004, Al Manar was estimated to hold 10-15 million viewers daily worldwide. Critics claim al-Manar's agenda is influenced by Iran by virtue of the "significant portion" of Hezbollah's budget shortfall that is covered by Iran, via some of the "&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 100 and $200 million a year" Iran provides to Hezbollah itself. Al-Manar officials strongly deny this, saying they are subsidized by the Hezbollah party and donations from other &lt;a href="Islam"&gt;Muslims&lt;/a&gt;, not by Iran. Al-Manar calls itself the "Station of the Resistance" (qanat al-muqawama) and is a key player in what Hezbollah calls its "&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Apsychological%20warfare"&gt;psychological warfare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; against the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AZionist"&gt;Zionist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; enemy"

"It's a war. Al-Manar is Hezbollah's main communication tool, through which it spreads anti-Israeli, anti-Semitic, and anti-American incitement. It spreads Hezbollah and Iranian values of radical Islam," Dr. Reuven Erlich said. Erlich is the head of the Terrorism Information Center in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHerzliya"&gt;Herzliya&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Israel. He added that the fact that Al-Manar can now be seen in south-east Asia, means that &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Malaysia"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;, two countries with a large Muslim population, are open to its messages of hatred.

Thaicom said it is considering its response and will only offer a formal reaction over the weekend adding the decision to transmit Al-Manar broadcasts was a "purely business decision, which had nothing to do with politics."

<h2>Wikinews News Brief 01-11-2008 01:20 UTC</h2>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
[Opening music] This is Wikinews News Brief, summarising the current news on Friday the 11th of January 2008 at 01:20 hours UTC. I’m Nicholas Turnbull.

<h2>Events of worldwide notability, military action, disasters etc.</h2>
<h3>At least 24 killed in suicide bombing in Pakistan</h3>

At least 24 people have been killed and more than 60 were injured in a suicide bomb attack outside a courthouse in the Pakistani city of Lahore. The bomb exploded at approximately 0700 UTC, and is thought by Lahore police to have been aimed at police offers stationed at the courthouse in preparation for an anti-government protest by lawyers. The scene pictured on local television was one of chaos, showing the road outside the courthouse littered with the dead and injured in the aftermath of the attack.

<h3>Alabama father throws children in river</h3>
A 37-year-old shrimp fisherman named Lam Luong, from Irvington in Alabama, has confessed to throwing his four children off an 80-foot-high bridge following an argument with his wife the previous day. Luong has been charged with four counts of capital members; an extensive search using divers, dogs and helicopters is currently being undertaken in a 100-square-mile area to locate the children's bodies, involving a total of 70 people working on the search. Luong appeared at court yesterday in the first hearing relating to the charges against him. Family members had initially feared that Luong had traded the children to fund an alleged drug habit although also commented that Luong and his wife, Ngoc Phan, had been fighting extensively prior to the incident. According to Associated Press, the authorities believe that the Dauphin Island Bridge was the site of the murder. The investigation and court proceedings continue.

<h3>British troops may have received contaminated blood from American donors</h3>
The British Ministry of Defence has confirmed that 18 personnel wounded on active service in Afghanistan and Iraq who needed emergency blood transfusions were given unscreened blood from emergency front-line donors. The recipients of this blood consequently may be at risk of infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS, although the Ministry of Defence described the risk as being "low". The armed forces personnel who were transfused with this blood are currently being tested for infectious diseases. The Ministry of Defence, in a statement, argues that the unscreened transfusions were necessary to keep these patients alive.

<h3>George Bush arrives in Middle East</h3>
United States president George W. Bush arrived in Israel on Wednesday, his first location on his tour throughout the Middle East intended to further peace negotiations between the Israeli and Palestinian governments, and to increase unity relating to Iran. Israeli leaders greeted Mr. Bush at Ben Gurion airport on his arrival, which is Mr. Bush's first visit to Israel in his presidency. Mr. Bush spoke of providing pressure on the issues should it be necessary and of the strong ties between the United States and Israel being through a shared belief in human freedom.

<h3>Pentagon releases video of incident involving Iranian ships in Persian Gulf</h3>
A video has been released by the Pentagon, the headquarters of the United States Department of Defence, of an incident where Iranian high-speed boats attempted to surround at least three United States warships passing through international waters in the Persian Gulf on January the 7th. The video, shot from the USS Hopper, runs for four minutes and shows the speedboats racing towards the United States naval vessels. On Tuesday, US president George W. Bush called the actions of the Iranian military a "provocative act".

<h3>China has plan to obtain North Korea's nuclear weapons</h3>
According to a report by the Centre of Strategic and International Studies in Washington, the People's Liberation Army of China has plans to seize North Korea's nuclear arsenal should it become necessary. This is on the basis of dialogue between the centre and Chinese military researchers who claimed that the Chinese military would be dispatched to obtain the weapons stockpiled by North Korea and that China would try to coordinate its efforts with the international community, primarily with the United Nations. Richard Spencer, of the Daily Telegraph, considers the plan to indicate a major change of attitude in China's government towards neighbouring North Korea.

<h3>Hezbollah network Al-Manar available to wider international audience</h3>

Thaicom, a Thai satellite television broadcasting company, has begun airing television network Al-Manar, run by Shi'a Islamic political and paramilitary organisation Hezbollah, which is based in Lebanon. As a consequence, Al-Manar can now be viewed in Asia, Australia, Africa, the Middle East and most of Europe. Hezbollah is considered a terrorist organisation by the some countries including the United States and Israel. This is considered something of a blow to Israel, who is currently trying to fight Hezbollah's activities in the Gulf region. Some fear that this will increase support of Hezbollah and aid its recruiting efforts. The station was launched by Hezbollah in 1991 with the aid of Iranian funds. Thaicom considers the decision to air the network as an entirely business-related decision with no political basis and has not yet offered a formal reaction to news reports.

<h2>Non-disastrous local events with notable impact and dead celebrities</h2>
<h3>Moderate earthquake strikes off the Oregon coast, US</h3>
The United States Geological Survey announced that an earthquake of preliminary magnitude 6.4 on the Richter scale has struck off the coast of Oregon in the United States on Thursday morning at 01:37 hours UTC, its epicentre being located northwest of Barview registering a depth of 10 kilometres. No reports of damage, injuries or deaths have yet been issued, nor is a tsunami feared, although there is a chance that small waves could be generated locally by possible landslides.

<h3>Hollywood "Mayor" Johnny Grant dead at 84</h3>
Jonny Grant, honorary mayor and civic personality of Los Angeles, died at 84 on Wednesday evening. Grant often presided at the installation of new stars at the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and lived in the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, being found dead in his bed by members of his staff.

<h3>China bans free plastic bags</h3>
In an effort to reduce the usage of plastic bags in China, estimated at three billion per day, the People's Republic of China has banned free plastic bags, the ban taking effect from June the 1st this year. The State Council has also stated that the manufacturing, sale and use of very thin plastic bags under 0.025 milimetres in thickness will also be banned, companies who violate this risking the possibility of a fine. It is hoped by the government that the ban will help reduce the amount of crude oil used for plastic packaging, estimated at five million tonnes per year. China is not the first to implement such a ban, which is similar to that implemented by Uganda and South Africa.

<h3>John McCain and Hillary Clinton win New Hampshire primaries</h3>

<h3>Canupa Gluha Mani speaks about Lakota Oyate, Lakota freedom</h3>
In an interview with Wikinews, Canupa Ghula Mani, the head of the Cante Tenza (translated in English as the Strong Heart Warrior Society), the paramilitary force of the Native American Lakota tribe, has endorsed the statements made by Lakota Freedom Delegation liason that the recent attempt by spokesperson Russell Means to withdraw treaties between the tribe and the United States Government were not reflective of the opinions of the Lakota people. He did, however, view the ensuing furore as a lack of communication and expressed love for his uncle Means despite the apparent rift. Means, in a four-person delegation allegedly acting on behalf of the tribe, submitted a motion to the United States State Department to withdraw the treaties; this action has been disowned by the Bureau of Indian Affairs-recognised tribal governments, and the furore continues.

<h3>Singapore Airlines bid for China Eastern Airlines unsuccessful</h3>
A bid made by Singapore Airlines for a 24% stake in China Eastern Airlines was turned down by minority shareholders on Wednesday. Talks between Singapore Airlines and China Eastern Airlines about a possible deal began in March 2007, and continued throughout the year, both companies suspending trading of their shares on the 21st of May 2007. The vote as to whether to conduct the sale took place at a shareholder meeting in Shanghai, and the rejection is said to be bad news for management at China Eastern Managers who were in support of the takeover by Singapore Airlines. The Singaporean government owns a 55% stake in Singapore Airlines via Temasek Holdings. A bid by Air China for the company is likely tobe larger than that of Singapore Airlines and may be supported by Cathay Pacific, who are in a cross-shareholding relationship with China National Aviation Corporation, the parent company of Air China.

<h3>Apple to lower UK iTunes prices</h3>
The European Commission has forced Apple Inc. to lower its prices in the United Kingdom iTunes online music store. The prices will be reduced to an average of £0.74 GBP per song from the current £0.79 GBP, and average album prices will be reduced from £7.99 GBP per album to £7.48. This is to match prices charged elsewhere in the European Union, as an investigation by the European Commission found that Apple are presently charging customers up to 10% more than in other EU countries. According to The Register, Apple will be passing this reduction in price onto record labels as a consequence of this forced price cut.

<h3>Global premiere of Lordi horror movie Dark Floors next month in Oulu, Finland</h3>
In cinema, the global premiere of a horror movie by Finnish theatrical hard rock band Lordi, ♡❤Dark Floors♡❤, is to take place on the 8th of February at the Oulun Energia Areena, in the Finnish city of Oulu according to a recent announcement. The film is based on an original concept by director Pete Riski, who directed all of Lordi's music videos, in collaboration with the band's frontman and lead vocalist. Riski himself has directed the film, which has been shot in the United Kingdom. The dialogue is in English, and has a largely British cast, with the exception of Lordi themselves who appear in their characteristic monster costumes playing a group of monsters terrorising a group of people trapped in a hospital.

<h3>Fourteen days left to send National Geographic your shoe for world record</h3>
National Geographic Kids, a magazine by the National Geographic Society, has been collecting used running shoes from across the United States in an attempt to create the world's longest chain of shoes. The organisers welcome shoes of any type and size, so long as they have laces and are meant for humans. The collected shoes will be sorted afterwards, and the Nike Reuse-a-Shoe programme will take and recycle them. Donations of shoes can be sent until the 22nd of January.

<h3>Dr. Phil's consultation meant to be private: Spears family</h3>
A spokesperson for the parents of Britney Spears, Lou Taylor, spoke out against television psychologist Dr. Phil McGraw on ♡❤The Today Show♡❤ regarding his release of information following Spears' consultations with McGraw. The family of Spears feels that McGraw has exploited the family's trust by making public statements about Spears' mental health. The Spears family feels that McGraw was consulted as a medical professional and not as a television personality and was asked to keep information relating to Ms. Spears' mental health confidential. Rumours had circulated that the family would appear on McGraw's television show ♡❤Dr. Phil♡❤ but Taylor told interviewer Meredith Viera that the family had never discussed such plans. Spears was hospitalised after being deemed a safety risk to herself, but was released within 24 hours as opposed to the normal 72 hours.

This weekend's &lt;a href="w%3A65th%20Golden%20Globe%20Awards"&gt;65th Golden Globe Awards&lt;/a&gt; ceremonies in Los Angeles are the latest victim of the ongoing labour strike by American entertainment writers. On Sunday, the awards will be presented during a news conference at the Hilton hotel in &lt;a href="w%3ABeverly%20Hills%2C%20California"&gt;Beverly Hills, California&lt;/a&gt; instead of the traditional annual televised event. The broadcast will include interview clips of the celebrities.

The &lt;a href="w%3AGolden%20Globe%20Award"&gt;Golden Globe Awards&lt;/a&gt; are conducted by the &lt;a href="w%3AHollywood%20Foreign%20Press%20Association"&gt;Hollywood Foreign Press Association&lt;/a&gt; (HFPA) and honour television and motion picture achievements. They are a prelude to next month's &lt;a href="w%3A80th%20Academy%20Awards"&gt;Academy Awards&lt;/a&gt; whose ceremony and telecast are also in jeopardy if the strike continues. HFPA President Jorge Camara expressed disappointment that a full Golden Globe awards presentation would not proceed this year.

Members of the &lt;a href="w%3AWriters%20Guild%20of%20America"&gt;Writers Guild of America&lt;/a&gt; walked off the job in November. The HFPA unsuccessfully attempted to negotiate a deal with the union to allow writers to work on the Golden Globe event.

&lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; mountaineer &lt;a href="w%3AEdmund%20Hillary"&gt;Sir Edmund Hillary&lt;/a&gt; died of a &lt;a href="w%3AMyocardial%20infarction"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AAuckland%20City%20Hospital"&gt;Auckland City Hospital&lt;/a&gt; at 9 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3ATime%20in%20New%20Zealand"&gt;NZDT&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC%2B13"&gt;UTC+13&lt;/a&gt;) today. He was 88.

On May 29, 1953, Hillary and &lt;a href="w%3ATenzing%20Norgay"&gt;Tenzing Norgay&lt;/a&gt; became the first climbers to attain the summit of &lt;a href="w%3AMount%20Everest"&gt;Mount Everest&lt;/a&gt;, the tallest peak on earth. 

Hillary was made a Knight Commander of the &lt;a href="w%3AOrder%20of%20the%20British%20Empire"&gt;Order of the British Empire&lt;/a&gt; as well as a Knight of the &lt;a href="w%3AOrder%20of%20the%20Garter"&gt;Order of the Garter&lt;/a&gt;, and a charter member of the &lt;a href="w%3AOrder%20of%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Order of New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;. He was awarded honorary citizenship of &lt;a href="Nepal"&gt;Nepal&lt;/a&gt; in 2003 for his humanitarian work for the people of Nepal.

Sir Edmund's death has been noted by the placement of flags at half-mast at the New Zealand parliament and at &lt;a href="w%3AScott%20Base"&gt;Scott Base&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Antarctica"&gt;Antarctica&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="Helen%20Clark"&gt;Helen Clark&lt;/a&gt;, Prime Minister of New Zealand, said Sir Edmund was not just another New Zealander like he had wanted to believe but, "a colossus." 

Ms. Clark said, "He was an heroic figure who not only 'knocked off' Everest but lived a life of determination, humility and generosity."

&lt;a href="w%3AQueen%20Elizabeth%20II"&gt;Queen Elizabeth&lt;/a&gt; of the UK said the she was "very saddened" by the death of Sir Edmund.

Hillary was in the hospital at the time of his death but was expected to come home that day according to his family. 
"The legendary mountaineer, adventurer, and philanthropist is the best-known New Zealander ever to have lived. But most of all he was a quintessential Kiwi. He was ours - from his craggy appearance and laconic style to his directness and honesty. All New Zealanders will deeply mourn his passing," Ms. Clark said.

A state funeral will be held for Hillary following an offer from the &lt;a href="w%3APolitics%20of%20New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand Government&lt;/a&gt;.

He was born Edmund Percival Hillary on July 20, 1919. His first wife, Louise, and one of their three children, Belinda, died in a plane crash in 1975 while helping with Hillary's philanthropic work. Sir Edmund is survived by his second wife, Lady June Mulgrew, and the other children from his first marriage, Peter and Sarah.

<h1>KDE 4 desktop environment released</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=KDE%204%20desktop%20environment%20released&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The fourth major version of the &lt;a href="w%3AKDE"&gt;K Desktop Environment&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AKDE%204"&gt;KDE 4.0&lt;/a&gt;, was released today after several years of development and testing.

KDE is a &lt;a href="w%3AFree%20software"&gt;free software&lt;/a&gt; project which aims to provide an easy to use desktop for &lt;a href="w%3AUNIX"&gt;UNIX&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALinux"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; workstations. As part of KDE also comes applications for many daily needs, and a complete platform for developers with the tools and documentation needed to write applications for the system.

The release is a major break from the last major version, KDE 3. The most immediately obvious new feature is &lt;a href="w%3APlasma_%2528KDE%2529"&gt;Plasma&lt;/a&gt;, a new desktop shell. Plasma provides a panel, a menu and other means to interact with the desktop and applications. Plasma also features a widget engine, that allows users to use various desktop widgets that are referred to as plasmoids.

Among other major changes are &lt;a href="w%3APhonon%20%28KDE%29"&gt;Phonon&lt;/a&gt;, a framework independent multimedia API, &lt;a href="w%3ASolid%20%28KDE%29"&gt;Solid&lt;/a&gt;, a device integration framework and &lt;a href="w%3AOxygen%20%28KDE%29"&gt;Oxygen&lt;/a&gt;, a new style guide and default icon set and a move to Qt 4, the most recent release of the &lt;a href="w%3AQt"&gt;Qt&lt;/a&gt; application development framework.

KDE 4.0 packages are available for &lt;a href="w%3ADebian"&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFedora"&gt;Fedora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGentoo"&gt;Gentoo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AKubuntu"&gt;Kubuntu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMandriva"&gt;Mandriva&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AopenSUSE"&gt;openSUSE&lt;/a&gt;.
