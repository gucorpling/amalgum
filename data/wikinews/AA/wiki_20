Violence erupted in &lt;a href="w%3AVadodara"&gt;Vadodara&lt;/a&gt; in the state of &lt;a href="w%3AGujarat"&gt;Gujarat&lt;/a&gt; after municipal authorities demolished a ♡❤dargah♡❤ (Muslim shrine). The shrine was an unauthorised structure that was obstructing a road-widening project. 
The Muslim community objected to its demolition citing the fact that it was at least 200 years old. They also observed that many Hindu temples that were unauthorised were spared. Despite the reservations of the minority community, the authorities decided to proceed with the razing of the ♡❤dargah♡❤, leading to rioting. 

At least 6 people were killed in the clashes, and one citizen (35 year-old Rafiq Vora) was burnt alive in his car by an angry mob. Curfew has been imposed in the troubled areas and the sending of instigatory text messages prompted authorities to temporarily block the sending of mobile-phone text messages in the town. 
Vadodara is infamous for the horrific Hindu-Muslim clashes in 2002, which left thousands dead. To avoid the recurrence of such a tragedy, six battalions of Rapid Action Force anti-riot police and multiple companies of the Central Reserve Police Force have been rushed to Vadodara. Gujarat Chief Minister &lt;a href="w%3ANarendra%20Modi"&gt;Narendra Modi&lt;/a&gt;, who was Chief Minister during the &lt;a href="w%3A2002%20Gujarat%20violence%23The_role_of_the_Central_and_the_Gujarat_state_government_in_the_riots"&gt;2002 Gujarat violence&lt;/a&gt;, for which the state government was accused by various independent human rights groups as well as major Indian newspapers of supporting, and in some cases instigating, the violence, is visiting Vadodara and has promised that all efforts would be made to prevent the situation from escalating any further. Home Minister Shivraj Patil is also monitoring the situation closely.

Most &lt;a href="w%3AU.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASoft%20Drink"&gt;soft drink&lt;/a&gt; companies will stop selling their soda products at high schools across the nation as part of a soft drink industry deal that aims to reduce childhood &lt;a href="w%3Aobesity"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;.

The agreement, announced Wednesday morning by the William J. Clinton Foundation, means that the nation's biggest beverage distributors, &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Coca-Cola%20Company"&gt;Coca Cola Co.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APepsico"&gt;Pepsico&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACadbury%20Schweppes"&gt;Cadbury Schweppes PLC&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Beverage%20Association"&gt;American Beverage Association&lt;/a&gt;, will pull their soda products from vending machines and cafeterias in schools serving about 35 million students, according to the Alliance for a Healthier Generation, a joint initiative between the Clinton Foundation and the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Heart%20Association"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;.

"This is an important announcement and a bold step forward in the struggle to help America's kids live healthier lives," said &lt;a href="Bill%20Clinton"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, according to a press release from the foundation. "These industry leaders recognize that childhood obesity is a problem and have stepped up to help solve it. I commend them for being here today and for taking this important step. There is a lot of work to be done to turn this problem around but this is a big step in the right direction and it will help improve the diet of millions of students across the country."

Under the agreement, high schools will still be able to purchase drinks such as diet and unsweetened teas, diet sodas, sports drinks, flavored water, seltzer, and low-calorie sports drinks for resale to students.

The companies plan to stop soda sales at 75 percent of the nation's public schools by the 2008-2009 school year, and at all schools in the following school year. The speed of the changes will depend in part on school districts' willingness to change their contracts with the beverage distributors, the release said.

&lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; had already banned soda sales at Logan and other state high schools, starting in July 2007, under a bill signed by Governor &lt;a href="w%3AArnold%20Schwarzenegger"&gt;Arnold Schwarzenegger&lt;/a&gt;. "California is facing an obesity epidemic," he said at the time. He said he plans for the ban to be the first step in creating a healthier California.

The bill banning soda sales, SB965, was introduced last September by Senator &lt;a href="w%3AMartha%20Escutia"&gt;Martha Escutia&lt;/a&gt; of State Senate District 30 in Southern California. SB965 is one of several bills signed into law to "eliminate junk food and soda from campuses, and to increase the amount of fresh fruits and vegetables available to students," said Schwarzenegger. The new law will go into full effect by July 1, 2007.

State law already bans soda sales at the lower grade levels.

Elsie Lee Szeto, the director of Food and Nutrition Services of New Haven Unified School District in &lt;a href="w%3AUnion%20City%2C%20California"&gt;Union City&lt;/a&gt;, California, said that, under the new law, no less than 50 percent of all beverages sold to students between a half hour before school begins and a half-hour after school will have to meet specific criteria that include alternatives like fruit based drinks that are comprised of no less than 50 percent fruit juice and have no added sweeteners. All milk sold will be two percent fat milk, soy milk, and other similar non-dairy milk.

About 16 percent of our nation's children and adolescents are overweight or obese – nearly four times more than forty years ago, according to the Alliance for a Healthier Generation.

According to the &lt;a href="w%3ACenter%20of%20Science%20in%20the%20Public%20Interest"&gt;Center of Science in the Public Interest&lt;/a&gt; (CSPI), a non-profit advocacy group in Washington D.C., two out of three teenagers in California drink soda everyday. The average intake for males 13 to 18 is three or more cans of soda a day.

A recent study by researchers of &lt;a href="w%3AChildren%27s%20Hospital%20Boston"&gt;Children's Hospital Boston&lt;/a&gt; showed a connection between consumption of sugary drinks and childhood obesity.

Children's Hospital Boston's Cara Ebbeling, PhD, and David Ludwig, MD, PhD, led a controlled trial for 103 children ages 13 to 18. Half of the teens, picked randomly, were sent non-caloric beverages of their choosing. The remaining teens were asked to continue their regular eating and drinking habits as a control group.

After six months, the group that had received the calorie-free drink deliveries had an 82 percent decrease in the consumption of sugary drinks, while the control group continued unaffected. The body mass index of the drink delivery group decreased, while the control group had a slight increase. Other factors such as exercising and television viewing did not change in either group.

Ebbeling concluded that one 12-oz sugary drink every day converted to a one pound weight gain over 3 to 4 weeks. "It should be relatively simple to translate this intervention into a pragmatic public health approach. For example, schools could make non-caloric beverages available to students by purchasing large quantities at low costs," she said.

The agreement announced today "is really the beginning of a major effort to modify childhood obesity at the level of the school systems," said Robert H. Eckel, president of the American Heart Association.

&lt;br style="clear:both;"&gt;

An &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Tonga%20earthquake"&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt; with estimated magnitude 8.0 (later, revised to 7.9 by &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Geological%20Survey"&gt;USGS&lt;/a&gt;) shook the Pacific island of &lt;a href="w%3ATonga"&gt;Tonga&lt;/a&gt;. The strongest quake of the year so far, the earthquake occurred at 04:26 local time (15:27 &lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated%20Universal%20Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;) on May 3 at 19.9°S, 174.2°W, about 150 KM south of Neiafu, &lt;a href="w%3ATonga"&gt;Tonga&lt;/a&gt; and 2150 KM north-northeast of &lt;a href="w%3AAuckland"&gt;Auckland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;. 

Three more earthquakes with moderate magnitude of 5.1 (1700 UTC, 06:00 local time), 5.4 (1756 UTC, 06:56 local time) and 5.1 (1928 UTC, 8:28 local time) were felt in the same region, according to USGS report. 

The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in &lt;a href="w%3AHonolulu"&gt;Honolulu&lt;/a&gt; issued tsunami warnings for Fiji and New Zealand and a tsunami watch for other areas in the Pacific, including Hawaii, but excluding the west coast of North America. The warning and watches were cancelled at 1736 &lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated%20Universal%20Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt; (7:36 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3AHawaii-Aleutian%20Standard%20Time%20Zone"&gt;HST&lt;/a&gt;).

According to the latest bulletin, sea level readings indicated a tsunami was generated. There was some definite tsunami activity recorded near Pago Pago and Niue.

No major damage or injuries have been reported in Tonga, but power was temporarily lost, which reportedly prevented Tongan authorities from receiving the tsunami warning issued by the PTWC.

Fourteen schools in Hawaii located on or near coastlines were closed all of Wednesday despite the warnings being lifted.

<h3>&lt;a href="Communal%20tension%20erupts%20in%20Vadodara%2C%20India"&gt;Communal tension erupts in Vadodara, India&lt;/a&gt;</h3>

India

Violence erupted in Vadodara in the state of Gujarat after municipal authorities demolished a dargah (Muslim shrine). The shrine was an unauthorised structure which was obstructing a road-widening project.
The Muslim community objected to its demolition citing the fact that it was atleast 200 years old. They also observed that many Hindu temples which were unauthorised were spared.

<h3>&lt;a href="BJP%20leader%20Pramod%20Mahajan%20dies%20in%20Mumbai"&gt;BJP leader Pramod Mahajan dies in Mumbai&lt;/a&gt;</h3>

Mumbai

Senior politician and general-secretary of the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party, Pramod Mahajan, passed way in Hinduja Hospital, Mumbai at 16:10 IST (10:40 UTC) today. He was 56 years of age. Mr. Mahajan had been shot three times at point blank range by his younger brother Pravin on 22 April 2006. After being shot, Mr. Mahajan was rushed to hospital where he was given 25 bottles of blood to compensate for the extensive bleeding he suffered. Pramodji also sustained severe injuries to his pancreas and small intestine. Over the past 12 days his condition had remained critical yet stable. He was on a respirator, and ionotropes had to be administered to him to keep his blood pressure up. The seriousness of the condition made it unsafe for doctors to operate on him and remove the bullets lodged in Pramodji's body.

<h3>&lt;a href="New%20Zealand%20Government%20to%20unbundle%20local%20loop"&gt;New Zealand Government to unbundle local loop&lt;/a&gt;</h3>

New Zealand

The New Zealand Government has announced that it would require Telecom to unbundled the local loop to provide "faster and better broadband internet services." New Zealand used to be the only country in the OECD to have investigated unbundling the local loop and then rejected it. This means now that any ISP in New Zealand can create their own plans / speeds for New Zealanders.

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; District Judge &lt;a href="w%3ALeonie%20Brinkema"&gt;Leonie Brinkema&lt;/a&gt; has agreed to a federal jury's recommendation that &lt;a href="w%3AZacarias%20Moussaoui"&gt;Zacarias Moussaoui&lt;/a&gt;, convicted for conspiring with &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%2C%202001%20attacks"&gt;September 11 attacks&lt;/a&gt;, spend life in prison. He will serve his life term in a federal maximum security prison, in &lt;a href="w%3AFlorence%2C%20Colorado"&gt;Florence, Colorado&lt;/a&gt;.

"God curse America. God save Osama bin Laden. You'll never get him," said Moussaoui moments before Judge Brinkema read her sentence.

Brinkema responded, "You came here to be a martyr and die in a big bang of glory. But to paraphrase the poet T.S. Eliot, instead you will die with a whimper."

The jury, which consisted of three women and nine men, announced their verdict after one week of deliberation and a trial that lasted only six weeks.

"America, you lost! I won!," said Moussaoui after the verdict was read. 

At least three jurors came to a conclusion that Moussaoui did not know enough about the attacks, three said that his role in the attacks were minor, three said that as a child, Moussaoui suffered from racism, nine said that his father abused him, and the other jurors said that the "dysfunctional family" forced him to leave his home.

This verdict "represents the end of this case but not an end to the fight against terror," said U.S. President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;. "Mr. Moussaoui got a fair trial. The jury convicted him to life in prison, where he will spend the rest of his life. In so doing, they spared his life, which is something that he evidently was not willing to do for innocent American citizens. It is really important for the United States to stay on the offence against these killers and bring them to justice."

Carie Lemack, the daughter of a September 11 victim, said "there's absolutely nothing in this country that all 9/11 family members are going to agree upon except that the attacks should never happen again, and I respect everyone's opinion. I think what's important is that we make sure Moussaoui will not get what he wants, which is to become a martyr and go down in history being someone bigger than he was. I'm glad that the jury looked at the evidence and realized he's just an al-Qaeda wannabe."

When Moussaoui spoke he said; "I have seen an amount of hypocrisy beyond any belief, your humanity is very selective humanity...You have branded me as a terrorist or a criminal ...you should look at yourselves first ...I am a mujahid and you think you own the world, and you must admit you are wrong."

He described the trial as a "wasted opportunity for this country to understand and to learn why people like me and people like Mohamed Atta and the rest have so much hatred for you. You don't want to hear, America. You will feel. We will come back another day," he declared.

&lt;a href="w%3AEarl%20Woods"&gt;Earl Woods&lt;/a&gt;, the father of &lt;a href="w%3ATiger%20Woods"&gt;Tiger Woods&lt;/a&gt;, died from cancer today at his home in &lt;a href="w%3ACypress%2C%20California"&gt;Cypress, California&lt;/a&gt;, at the age of 74. 

Woods died of &lt;a href="w%3Aprostate%20cancer"&gt;prostate cancer&lt;/a&gt;, which returned to his body after a previous bout with prostate cancer from 1986-1998, but it was treated with radiation. 

Although Earl was sometimes posed as an overwhelming, bossy father, Tiger treated Earl as "an amazing dad, coach, mentor, soldier, husband and friend." Tiger also posted that "I wouldn't be where I am today without him, and I'm honored to continue his legacy of sharing and caring." 

Tiger skipped this week's PGA Tour event, the Wachovia Championship, to be with his father. Two of his closest friends, Mark O'Meara and John Cook, followed suit. 

Woods, who grew up as an African-American child during the 1940's in rural Kansas, played baseball as a high-schooler and in the Negro Leagues, withstanding racism the whole way. During his two trips in the Vietnam War as a Green Beret, Woods met his lifelong friend, Vietnamese Col. Vuong Dang "Tiger" Phong, after whom he named his son.

Earl met his wife, Kutilda Punsawad, in Thailand. They married in 1969, and their son, "Tiger", was born December 30, 1975.

Rescuers are continuing their efforts to reach the trapped miners in the Beaconsfield mine in northern &lt;a href="Tasmania"&gt;Tasmania&lt;/a&gt;.

A five tonne borer drilling machine has been secured in place to drill a one metre hole through the remaining 12-16 metres of rock that fell into the main shaft.

Since drilling began at 7pm last night, the machine has made a 2 cm wide pilot hole half way to the miners.

The trapped miners have been given egg sandwiches and yogurt, and have received apple ipod MP3 players filled with the miners favourite songs to pass the time and drown out the sounds of the drilling.

Meanwhile on the surface, the ever-growing media frenzy in Beaconsfield has forced the mine operators to enforce bag checks of rescuers entering the mine to ensure that no recording devices are taken into the mine.

Voting day, Thursday 4th May, has begun for the local elections taking place in &lt;a href="w%3AEngland"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;. The elections will appoint local councillors, and, in some boroughs, local Mayors. Council elections include all 32 &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20boroughs"&gt;London boroughs&lt;/a&gt;, 36 &lt;a href="w%3AMetropolitan%20borough"&gt;metropolitan boroughs&lt;/a&gt; and 88 &lt;a href="w%3ANon-metropolitan%20district"&gt;non-metropolitan districts&lt;/a&gt;. Mayoral elections will be held for &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Borough%20of%20Hackney"&gt;Hackney&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AWatford"&gt;Watford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANewham"&gt;Newham&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Borough%20of%20Lewisham"&gt;Lewisham&lt;/a&gt;. In the non-London council areas, the voting will affect either a third or half of the total number of councillors. In London, all council seats are up for election. Some council areas are not taking part in the election.

Polling stations will open between 07:00 and 22:00. Many voters will also have had the opportunity to apply for a postal vote. Counting begins once the polls close, with the results typically available in the early hours of the next morning.

The Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties have all launched major campaigns, as have some smaller parties such as the Green Party, UKIP (United Kingdom Independence Party), Respect and the BNP (British National Party).

New filmmaker &lt;a href="w%3ASolomon%20Rothman"&gt;Solomon Rothman&lt;/a&gt; has released a trailer for his upcoming full length open source film called '&lt;a href="w%3ABoy%20Who%20Never%20Slept"&gt;Boy Who Never Slept&lt;/a&gt;.' Both the movie and the trailer are offered under a &lt;a href="w%3ACreative%20Commons"&gt;Creative Commons&lt;/a&gt; Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5 license. The movie is set to be released at the end of May.

The &lt;a href="w%3Afilm"&gt;film&lt;/a&gt; centers on the life of an insomniac writer who meets a teenage girl online, and a friendship that grows into an unlikely love story wrapped in harsh reality. The movie deals with various issues, including the romanticization of love, age-related issues in relationships, like statuatory rape (he's 23, and she's 16), and the idea of love in the online realm.

Rothman, a writer, amateur filmmaker and web designer, lives in the Los Angeles Area. He wrote, directed and produced the movie with Aurora Mae, his girlfriend and partner. Producing the movie for $200 while they were in college, they used friends as actors and later sold the camera on &lt;a href="w%3AeBay"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt; to recoup the expense. 

Rothman has spoken about the power of the internet as a distribution source for movies and has said "I believe it's possible that this movie I shot with no budget and released online for free could potentially reach as many viewers as a major theatrical release."

Rothman and Mae started out with the idea of creating a full-length movie that could be shared totally for free online. The film includes a custom soundtrack and script, both of which will be released open source as well.

The trailer is available on the official movie website&lt;a href="http%3A//www.solomonrothman.com/boywhoneverslept"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and can also be found on Google video, YouTube.com, Ifilm.com, AddictedClips.com, and the Internet Movie Archives.

After a six month voting window, adoption of the &lt;a href="w%3AOpenDocument"&gt;Open Document Format&lt;/a&gt; (ODF) as an &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Organization%20for%20Standardization"&gt;ISO&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="w%3AIEC"&gt;IEC&lt;/a&gt; standard has become official, with a unanimous vote supporting the ODF (and some abstentions). The ODF format allows developers to produce office-type applications which use an inter-operable standard, allowing users to share documents without requiring a specific application to read them. The format covers text documents, spreadsheets, databases, charts and presentations.

ISO Secretary-General Alan Bryden said, "[this publication] reflects the international community's recognition of the importance of open formats in enabling business interoperability."

So far, the two major applications which support the ODF format are &lt;a href="w%3AOpenOffice.org"&gt;OpenOffice.org&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AKOffice"&gt;KOffice&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20Office"&gt;Microsoft Office&lt;/a&gt; currently dominates the market for office applications, although several third-party applications also contain limited support for the &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; Office formats.

&lt;a href="w%3APablo%20Picasso"&gt;Pablo Picasso&lt;/a&gt;'s famous portrait of his lover has been auctioned for $95.2 million at Sotheby's in New York on Wednesday. 1941 masterpiece "Dora Maar with cat/ Dora Maar au chat" was sold to an anonymous buyer. This is the second highest amount ever paid in an auction. The highest amount paid so far for a painting is $104 million ("Boy with a pipe/Garcon a la pipe" by Picasso, 1905), which was auctioned in 2004. &lt;a href="w%3AVincent%20Van%20Gogh"&gt;Vincent Van Gogh&lt;/a&gt;'s "Portrait with Dr. Gachet" was sold at $82.5 million.

&lt;a href="w%3ADora%20Maar"&gt;Dora Maar&lt;/a&gt;, herself an artist, believed to have helped Picasso in the execution of the famous masterpiece "&lt;a href="w%3AGuernica"&gt;Guernica&lt;/a&gt;," which depicted the horror of Spanish civil war. They had a relationship that lasted for a decade.

Picasso was born in Malaga, Spain on 25 October 1881. He died at the age of 92 in 1973.

Former &lt;a href="w%3AVictoria"&gt;Victorian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APremier%20of%20Victoria"&gt;Premier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJeff%20Kennett"&gt;Jeff Kennett&lt;/a&gt; said that he will consider returning to politics over the next 48 hours following the resignation of &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;Liberal party&lt;/a&gt; leader, &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Doyle"&gt;Robert Doyle&lt;/a&gt;. Mr Kennett was premier of Victoria from 1992 until 1999, when the &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Bracks"&gt;Steve Bracks&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Labor&lt;/a&gt; government narrowly defeated him.

Mr Doyle has resigned following his approval rating sinking to a low of 15 percent.

There have been rumours of Mr Kennett returning to politics after the liberal party lost its second election in 2002 election. These have now been heightened by Mr Doyle's resignation. Mr Kennett said numerous people have approached him over the past few months about a return to politics. "I have received over the last few months significant numbers of approaches from both political and non-political people" he said.

It is expected that transport spokesman, Terry Mulder and planning spokesman Ted Baillieu may also run for the position of Victorian Liberal party leader. The new leader will be decided at a party meeting on Monday, when Mr Doyle will formally resign from the position.

If the party selects Mr Kennett as its leader there may be a number of interesting scenarios played out as Mr Kennett is not currently a member of parliament. He may be endorsed as leader immediately (in which case he would be an "outsider"), an acting leader may be elected until Mr Kennett returns to parliament at either the November 25 election or by winning a by-election. If the party decides to endorse Mr Kennett immediately, it would be the first time since 1993 that a party has had a leader who has not been a sitting member of parliament.

Mr Kennett has the support of &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; and most senior liberal party figure. A spokesperson for Mr Howard said that Mr Howard would welcome Mr Kennet's return to politics.

The &lt;a href="Greece"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; Premier &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKostas%20Caramanlis"&gt;Kostas Caramanlis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and his counterpart of &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARejep%20Tayyip%20Erdogan"&gt;Rejep Tayyip Erdogan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , had a meeting, for 45 minutes, in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThessaloniki"&gt;Thessaloniki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , northern Greece, in the sidelines of the Inter-Balkan Cooperation Summit. Caramanlis and Erdogan had the opportunity to discuss the bilateral issues between Greece and Turkey, such as the &lt;a href="Turkish%20Republic%20of%20Northern%20Cyprus"&gt;Cyprus Issue&lt;/a&gt;, the dispute between the two countries in the area of Aegean Sea as well as the process of Turkey's efforts to become a member of the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;. Today, the Prime Minister of Turkey will have the opportunity to visit the Turkish Consulate of Thessaloniki; the house in which the founder of the Republic of Turkey, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKemal%20Ataturk"&gt;Kemal Ataturk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , was born.

Except from the Caramanlis-Erdogan meeting, important discussions took place in Thessaloniki between the leaders of Southeast Europe countries. The &lt;a href="Bulgaria"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt;n Prime Minister denied the reports in Bulgarian Media, whereby the Bulgarian public sector was backing out of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABurgas"&gt;Burgas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAlexandroupolis"&gt;Alexandroupolis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; oil pipe construction. In addition, the leaders welcomed the signing of the agreement for constructing a state-of-the-art railroad network in Southeast Europe, which as he said, would modernise rail transport, reduce travel time and increase the quality of the services provided in the region. 

&lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, a major contributor to Balkan reconstruction projects, has guest status at the meeting, represented by Deputy Foreign Minister, Akiko Yamanaka. The Summit focused on the European prospects of the Southeast European countries, economic relations, the issue with &lt;a href="Kosovo"&gt;Kosovo&lt;/a&gt;, and the political crisis in &lt;a href="Serbia"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt;, following the failed arrest of wanted General Mladic and the freezing of negotiations with the European Union.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHigh%20Court%20of%20Australia"&gt;High Court&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; challenge against the &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n federal government's &lt;a href="WorkChoices"&gt;Work Choices&lt;/a&gt; legislation has begun in &lt;a href="Canberra"&gt;Canberra&lt;/a&gt; today. The challenge was initiated by the governments of &lt;a href="New%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Western%20Australia"&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="South%20Australia"&gt;South Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Queensland"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Victoria%2C%20Australia"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt; and joined by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Workers%20Union"&gt;Australian Workers Union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and Unions NSW.

The states claim that the legislation, passed by parliament in December last year, is &lt;a href="Constitution%20of%20Australia"&gt;unconstitutional&lt;/a&gt;. The federal government will argue that the legislation is permitted under &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASection%2051%28xx%29%20of%20the%20Australian%20Constitution"&gt;Section 51(xx) of the Australian Constitution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , commonly known as the "corporations powers". The states argue that this section was never intended to be used for industrial arbitration.

Today, the court heard New South Wales' challenge to the laws. Solicitor-general of NSW, Michael Sexton, SC, said that the legislation would have been considered unconstitutional since federation over 100 years ago. He questioned whether or not the authors of Australia's constitution intended for the corporations provisions to extend to employees.

"What we do say is that this legislation would have been considered beyond a commonwealth power for most of the last century" he told the court.

Another lawyer for New South Wales, Bret Walker, SC, said states had been given the power of industrial relations, not the commonwealth government.

Some of the submissions made by New South Wales were attacked by Justice Haynes, one of the seven High Court judges presiding over the case, described the submission as being sloppy and ill-prepared.

Justice Haynes said that the definitions in the constitution need to be read in context of the 1890s, which were boom and bust times for corporations in Australia. He said that today, corporations are different to in the past. He also said that the authors would have been aware that there could be changes in the way the constitution was interpreted.

The premier of Queensland, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Beattie"&gt;Peter Beattie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is concerned that if the states lose their case that the powers between the states and commonwealth would need to be revised.

"We will need a constitutional convention to reshape the powers between the states and the Commonwealth" he said.

Scientists warn that &lt;a href="w%3AMount%20Merapi%2C%20Central%20Java"&gt;Mount Merapi&lt;/a&gt;, or "The Mountain of Fire," a large &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href="w%3Avolcano"&gt;volcano&lt;/a&gt; on the island of &lt;a href="w%3AJava"&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt; is likely to erupt. Molten &lt;a href="w%3Alava"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; and shallow volcanic earthquakes were recorded on Wednesday, as well as further tremors on Thursday morning.

Mount Merapi is the most active of 130 volcanoes in Indonesia. It is a strato-volcano with an active summit lava dome. It has small eruptions every 3-4 years and larger eruptions every 10-15 years. It has produced more pyroclastic flows, popularly known as heat cloud and magma, than any other volcano in the world. The last fatal eruption happened in 1994, killing 60. During the eruption in 1930, 1,300 people died. Historians say that Mount Merapi has been erupting for 10,000 years.

Mount Merapi is considered very sacred by the locals. According to the local folk-lore the volcano's eruption is the result of spirits being angered by not receiving sufficient offerings or by a disrespectful attitude among the people in slopes. 27,000 locals in 3 villages could be affected by this eruption. Scientists gave a warning of eruption a fortnight back and asked for immediate evacuation. The nearest city is &lt;a href="w%3AYogyakarta"&gt;Yogyakarta&lt;/a&gt;. The awesome sight of the erupting volcano has attracted many tourists and locals.

It has been rumbling and spewing ash for some time, but the BBC correspondent said that this is the real thing.

Fans of quirky numbers everywhere celebrated recently as the clock struck 01:02:03, 04/05/06 (using the DD/MM/YY date convention). This once-in-a-century event was highlighted in advance by webloggers and websites such as &lt;a href="w%3ABoing%20Boing"&gt;Boing Boing&lt;/a&gt;. For countries where the MM/DD/YY convention is more common, the event happened a month ago on 5th April.

The date attracted numerous comments when posted to the news website &lt;a href="w%3ADigg"&gt;Digg&lt;/a&gt;, and the special date has been mentioned by hundreds of thousands of websites, according to a Google search.

Blogger &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Scoble"&gt;Robert Scoble&lt;/a&gt; exclaimed, "the things geeks care about!"

Whilst 01:02:03, 04/05/06 won't happen again for another hundred years, those who missed out might want to celebrate 06:06:06, 06/06/06 in just over a month's time, unless you're a &lt;a href="w%3AHexakosioihexekontahexaphobia"&gt;hexakosioihexekontahexaphobic&lt;/a&gt;.

Rescuers are continuing their efforts to reach the trapped miners in the Beaconsfield mine in northern Tasmania.
A five tonne borer drilling machine has been secured in place to drill a one metre hole through the remaining 12-16 metres of rock that fell into the main shaft.
Since drilling began at 7pm last night, the machine has made a 2cm wide pilot hole half way to the miners.
The trapped miners have been given egg sandwiches and yogurt, and have received MP3 players to pass the time and drown out the sounds of the drilling.

U.S. Representative &lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20J.%20Kennedy"&gt;Patrick J. Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;D&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3ARhode%20Island"&gt;RI&lt;/a&gt;), son of Massachusetts Senator Edward Kennedy, was involved in a traffic accident near the U.S. Capitol in &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;

Capitol Hill Police reported that Kennedy was alone his 1997 Ford Mustang when the accident occurred Thursday at about 2:45 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3AEastern_Daylight_Time"&gt;EDT&lt;/a&gt; (0645 &lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated%20Universal%20Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;) near the 100 block of C Street SE. Police say his eyes were red and watery, and he was unbalanced and had slurred speech. Police also say that Kennedy had received three "notices of infractions" that are connected with the crash.

According to the police report, Kennedy drove his car into a security barrier near the Capitol building. When questioned by the police, he told them that he was "headed to the Capitol to make a vote," when no votes were scheduled for that time of the morning. 

Kennedy said in a written statement that he had returned home around midnight and had taken the sleep aid Ambien and the anti-nausea drug Phenergan, both of which are known to cause drowsiness and sedation. He awakened a couple hours later and was "disoriented" when the incident occurred. He also said that "at no time before the accident" did he take alcohol, and pledged to cooperate in any investigation.

Today, Kennedy said, "Apparently, I was disoriented from the medication" and that he "never asked for any preferential treatment." He also announced that he is checking himself into the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.

"I know I need help. As in every recovery, each day has its ups and downs.," added Kennedy. This is not the first time Kennedy has been to the Mayo Clinic. Last Christmas, Kennedy spent time at the clinic and went back to work after he was "feeling focused and in good shape." 

However; Robin Costello, spokeswoman for Kennedy said, "we have no knowledge of any citations," but she did admit that a report was filed.

Capitol Police have not commented on the report or allegations, but Sgt. Kimberly Schneider, Capitol Police spokeswoman did say, "The United States Capitol Police are continuing to investigate." 

It is not known whether any sobriety test or arrest was made. Kennedy was not injured.

Most of the results have now been declared from the local elections that took place across England yesterday. The Conservative Party has made the biggest gains, winning 316 new council seats and gaining a net control of 11 new councils. The Liberal Democrat party also made some gains, getting an overall bigger share of the vote than Labour, but only winning a modest 18 or so extra councillors.

The British National Party has doubled its number of councillors, winning 11 seats in the Barking and Dagenham area, as well as a few elsewhere. The Green Party has won a few extra councillors. The RESPECT party won 12 seats on the council of Tower Hamlets, making them now the official opposition.

&lt;a href="w%3ARobin%20Wales"&gt;Robin Wales&lt;/a&gt; has been re-elected as the Mayor for the London Borough of Newham, &lt;a href="w%3ADorothy%20Thornhill"&gt;Dorothy Thornhill&lt;/a&gt; re-elected the Mayor of Watford and &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Bullock"&gt;Steve Bullock&lt;/a&gt; re-elected as the Mayor for Lewisham. Results have not yet been announced for the election of the Mayor of Hackney.

In an immediate development, &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; sacked &lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Clarke"&gt;Charles Clarke&lt;/a&gt; from the post of Home Secretary.

Initial estimations suggest that turnout was 36%, a reduction of three points compared to 2004.

After announcing on Thursday that he was considering a comeback to &lt;a href="w%3AVictoria"&gt;Victorian&lt;/a&gt; state politics, former premier &lt;a href="w%3AJeff%20Kennett"&gt;Jeff Kennett&lt;/a&gt; has ruled out a comeback.

Following the resignation of state opposition leader &lt;a href="w%3ARober%20Doyle"&gt;Robert Doyle&lt;/a&gt;, Mr Kennett announced that he had been approached several times about returning to politics over the past few months and that he was contemplating standing for the Victorian liberal party leadership. He announced today, at a press conference that he would not be returning to state politics.

When asked whether he would consider a move to federal politics, Mr Kennett said he had no intention of going to &lt;a href="w%3ACanberra"&gt;Canberra&lt;/a&gt;. "I have no intention of going to Canberra, I don't like flying and I don't like being away from home at night." he told the media.

Following Mr Kennett's announcement, Terry Mulder, the Victorian liberal's transport spokesperson said that he was withdrawing from the leadership race. His move paves the way for planning spokesperson Ted Baillieu to become the party's new leader unopposed.

Mr Mulder said that Mr Baillieu had "overwhelming" support within the party.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; said that he believed Mr Baillieu would make a very good leader, but was disappointed that Mr Kennett had ruled out a comeback.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; and federal industry minister Ian MacDonald today announced that the federal government would be providing &lt;a href="w%3AFord%20Motor%20Company"&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt; Australia with a AU$52.5 million (US$40.4 million) "financial assistance package". Additional assistance will also be provided by the &lt;a href="w%3AVictoria"&gt;Victorian&lt;/a&gt; state government.

According to Mr Howard, the injection will secure Ford's manufacturing operations in Australia "for the long term".

From the package, AU$40 million will be used for the design and manufacture of Ford's next model &lt;a href="w%3AFord%20Falcon"&gt;Falcon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AFord%20Territory"&gt;Territory&lt;/a&gt; vehicles, which will be built in Australia.

Despite being given a major facelift in 2002 and another in 2005, the Falcon's bodyshell dates back to 1998. The current Falcon will need to serve the company until at least 2007 when the new model is anticipated. In the meantime, it will face stiff competition from the completely new &lt;a href="w%3AHolden%20Commodore"&gt;Holden Commodore&lt;/a&gt; (the Falcon's major competitor) which will be released in the second half of this year. 

The additional AU$12.5 million will be spent on the development of a light commercial vehicle platform, which will be built overseas and marketed to around 80 countries. Mr Howard said that the light commercial project would involve construction of a research and development centre, which will become the base for R&amp;D projects in the region.

Mr MacFarlane said that the research facility was exciting for Australia and that it would put the Australian automotive in the spotlight.

“The funding has helped Ford Australia secure the largest automotive R&amp;D project ever undertaken in Australia which is equally exciting news for local Ford employees and Australian component producers” he said.

“The project will see Ford Australia become a centre for automotive design and engineering excellence in the Asia Pacific region which will bring spin-off benefits for the broader industry,” 

“This opportunity will put both Ford Australia, and the Australian automotive and components sectors on the world map as far as our automotive design and engineering capabilities are concerned.” Mr MacFarlane said.

Mr Howard claims that the projects will create 273 jobs and secure the future of the "iconic" Ford Falcon, which has been built in Australia since 1960.

The financial package is conditional upon Ford Australia giving the Australian automotive component industry an opportunity to supply components for the vehicles produced by the two projects.

The United Kingdom Home Secretary &lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Clarke"&gt;Charles Clarke&lt;/a&gt; has lost his position in a Cabinet reshuffle by Tony Blair, on the morning after the Labour Party suffered losses in local elections across England. The news follows two weeks of headlines caused by the release of over 1000 foreign prisoners mistakenly released from prison at the end of their sentence rather than being deported.

Current Defence Secretary John Reid will replace Clarke as the new Home Secretary, and Jack Straw will become Commons leader.

There has been a riot in Santiago, a small town 25 kilometers from Mexico City. Violence exploded when three flower sellers were arrested on suspicion of trading without permits. 

Rioters attacked the police with sticks, machetes and petrol bombs.

Thousands of police quelled the crowd with tear gas and batons. Dozens were arrested. The arrested include peasant leader, Ignacio del Valle.

All 11 police officers held hostage by rioters were released. 

Javier Cortes Santiago, a fourteen year old boy, was killed in the riots. 

In 2002 rioters managed to cancel plans to build an airport in the town.

Naushad Ali, popularly known as Naushad, was born in 1919. He came to &lt;a href="w%3AMumbai"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/a&gt; ( then known as &lt;a href="w%3ABombay"&gt;Bombay&lt;/a&gt; ) to pursue his career as music composer in 1935. He got his first break in the film Prem Nagar in 1940, and established himself through his work in Sharda. Naushad had composed music for popular Hindi films such as &lt;a href="w%3AMughal-e-Azam"&gt;Mughal-e-Azam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMother%20India"&gt;Mother India&lt;/a&gt;, Baiju Bawra and &lt;a href="w%3APakeezah"&gt;Pakeezah&lt;/a&gt;. He also has the credit of introducing famous singers &lt;a href="w%3ALata%20Mangeshkar"&gt;Lata Mangeshkar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMohammad%20Rafi"&gt;Mohammad Rafi&lt;/a&gt; to Hindi film music. He was awarded the prestigious Dadasaheb Phalke Award for Lifetime Contribution to Hindi Cinema in 1981. His last contribution was to the 2005 film Taj Mahal - An Eternal Love Story.

He was also passionate about Angling as his hobby.

<h2>Agreement Signed</h2>

The &lt;a href="w%3ASudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt;ese government and &lt;a href="w%3ASudanese%20Liberation%20movement"&gt;Sudanese Liberation Movement&lt;/a&gt; (SLM), led by Minni Minnawi, signed a peace deal to end three years of conflict. Two smaller rebel groups rejected it despite last-minute efforts to get their support. 

The deal, which followed intense talks in &lt;a href="w%3AAbuja"&gt;Abuja&lt;/a&gt;, capital of &lt;a href="w%3ANigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;, calls for the disbandment of rebel forces and the disarmament of the pro-government &lt;a href="w%3AJanjaweed"&gt;Janjaweed&lt;/a&gt; militia. The conflict had killed about 200,000 and left about two million homeless. The accord, initiated by the &lt;a href="w%3AAfrican%20Union"&gt;African Union&lt;/a&gt;, was reached after two years of negotiations.

"I accept the document with some reservations concerning the power sharing," Mr Minnawi said. The SLM are the largest rebel group in the &lt;a href="w%3ADarfur"&gt;Darfur&lt;/a&gt; region of Sudan. One of his officials told that the SLM wanted more seats in parliament but had agreed to the deal to end the suffering of the people in &lt;a href="w%3ADarfur"&gt;Darfur&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Opposition</h2>

Two smaller groups said they were not happy with the terms of the deal. The Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) said it wanted fundamental changes to the document. The group's chief negotiator, Ahmed Tugod, reiterated the rebels' demands for the post of vice-president in the Khartoum government, to have the allocation of 6.5 percent of Sudan's national income to a Darfur development fund, and for greater representation in national institutions. 

"We decided not to sign it unless fundamental changes are made to this document, it did not meet a series of key demands." Mr Tugod said. 

The other faction of Sudanese Liberation Movement (SLM) likewise refused to sign it. "We need the document to be improved upon," the group's spokesman Abdel wahid Muhamed El Nur said. 

<h2>Mediators</h2>

Rebel negotiators faced intense pressure to accept the amended deal, as diplomats from the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABritain"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; struggled to find common ground. The initial deadline for the peace talks was Sunday at midnight, but was extended thrice. The peace plan was prepared by mediators from the &lt;a href="w%3AAfrican%20Union"&gt;African Union&lt;/a&gt; and was amended after the rebel groups did not agree at an early draft. International negotiators, including U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick, &lt;a href="w%3ANigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;n President Olusegun Obasanjo and British International Development Secretary Hilary Benn, said the deal was the best hope for peace in Darfur.

<h2>New Plan</h2>

The new plan decided to:

<ul>
BULLET::::- Disarm completely Janjaweed militia by mid-October.
BULLET::::- Place restrictions on the movements of the paramilitary Forces and requires them to be reduced in size.
BULLET::::- Establish buffer zones around IDP [internally displaced persons] camps and humanitarian assistance corridors, into which rebel forces and Sudanese Armed Forces cannot go.
BULLET::::- Define the principles for integration of the rebel forces into the Sudanese armed forces and police.
BULLET::::- Integrate 4,000 former combatants into the army.

BULLET::::- Award to the rebel movements one state governor of Darfur, and two deputy state governors.

BULLET::::- Establish a commission to work with the UN to help refugees and displaced persons return to their homes.
BULLET::::- Create a commission to provide compensation to victims of the conflict.

<h2>Recent History</h2>

Observers said failure to reach an agreement would have been disastrous for the people of Darfur, who have suffered through three years of conflict that has claimed 200,000 lives and driven more than 2 millions from their homes. The conflict began in the arid and impoverished region early in 2003 after a rebel group began attacking government targets, claiming the capital &lt;a href="w%3AKhartoum"&gt;Khartoum&lt;/a&gt; was neglecting the region. The rebels said the government was oppressing black &lt;a href="w%3AAfricans"&gt;Africans&lt;/a&gt; in favour of &lt;a href="w%3AArabs"&gt;Arabs&lt;/a&gt;.

On the other side, Arab Janjaweed militias, drawn from Arab tribes, had been conducting a campaign of destruction with alleged help from the government. To flush out the rebels they had allegedly been targeting innocent civilians. More than 90 villages were burnt and destroyed, millions have fled their destroyed villages, with many heading for camps near Darfur's main towns. But there was not enough food, water or medicine. The Janjaweed patrol outside the camps and Darfurians said the men were killed and the women were raped if they venture too far in search of firewood or water. Many women were reported being abducted by the Janjaweed and held as sex slaves for more than a week before being released. Some 200,000 had also sought safety in neighbouring Chad, but many of them were camped along a 600km stretch of the border and remain vulnerable to attacks from Sudan. Chad was worried that the conflict could spill over the border. Its eastern areas have a similar ethnic make-up to Darfur.
Darfur, which means land of the Fur, has the history of tensions for many years over land and grazing rights between the mostly nomadic Arabs, and farmers from the Fur, Massaleet and Zagawa communities. 

Human rights groups said that genocide was taking place, though a &lt;a href="w%3AUN"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; investigation team sent to Sudan said that while war crimes had been committed, there had been no intent to commit genocide. In April 2006, the &lt;a href="w%3AUN%20Security%20Council"&gt;UN Security Council&lt;/a&gt; passed a resolution imposing sanctions against four Sudanese nationals accused of war crimes in Darfur that include two rebel leaders, a former air force chief, and a Janjaweed militia leader. 

Sudan's government denied being in control of the Janjaweed and President Omar al-Bashir called them "thieves and gangsters". After strong international pressure and the threat of sanctions, the government promised to disarm the Janjaweed. But so far there was little evidence that this had been implemented. Thousands of extra policemen were deployed but the refugees had little faith in the Sudanese security forces. Some 7,000 African Union troops had slowly been deployed in Darfur on a very limited mandate. Experts said the soldiers were too few to cover the whole area, and the African Union said it did not have the money to fund the operation for much longer. Sudan was unhappy with suggestions that the UN take control of the peacekeeping mission. 

Many aid agencies working in Darfur were unable to get access to vast areas because of the fighting. They said a peace agreement is vital before the rainy season begins in June when planting of food crops must be completed. United Nations officials, meanwhile, warned that they would be unable to provide food and other aid to the more than two million people living in refugee camps unless the security situation improves.

&lt;a href="Cindy%20Sheehan"&gt;Cindy Sheehan&lt;/a&gt;, a prominent &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; anti-war &lt;a href="activist"&gt;activist&lt;/a&gt;, appeared at a news conference at the &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; capital of &lt;a href="Ottawa"&gt;Ottawa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Ontario"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday to speak &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOpposition%20to%20the%202001%20Afghanistan%20War"&gt;against western troops&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; being in &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, and in favour of Canada giving U.S. deserters refugee status.

"I believe our war resisters are legitimate refugees," Ms. Sheehan said while also alleging that the soldiers are within their rights to desert because many are "lied to" by U.S. military recruiters who tell them they won't have to fight in Iraq.

Sheehan, the mother of a fallen American soldier who served in Iraq, called on the Canadian Prime Minister &lt;a href="Stephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt; to "open the border" to U.S. military deserters.
"My son was an honourable, honest person lied to by his recruiter," she said.

Sheehan said that Canadian soldiers being in Afghanistan enables the United States to carry on its "illegal and immoral" war in Iraq. "I believe my country shouldn't be in Afghanistan anyway," Ms. Sheehan told reporters on Parliament Hill. "It's never about spreading freedom or democracy or making the world safe, it's about lining the war profiteers' pockets. My country supported &lt;a href="Osama%20bin%20Laden"&gt;Osama bin Laden&lt;/a&gt; in the fight against Russia," she said. "And now they go in and tear down that country. It's back in the hands of the drug lords, it's producing more opium than ever, and it's not safe. There's not any rebuilding going on, because it's being occupied by occupying forces." 

She made an address to approximately 300 students on Wednesday night at the &lt;a href="University%20of%20Toronto"&gt;University of Toronto&lt;/a&gt;. Her appearances are part of a cross-county campaign targeted at university campuses.

<h3>&lt;a href="Conservatives%20make%20gains%20in%20English%20local%20elections"&gt;Conservatives make gains in English local elections&lt;/a&gt;</h3>

England

Most of the results have now been declared from the local elections that took place across England yesterday. The Conservative party have made the biggest gains, winning over two hundred new council seats and gaining a net control of 12 new councils. The Liberal Democrat party also made some gains, getting an overall bigger share of the vote than Labour, but only winning a modest 18 or so extra councillors.
The British National Party has doubled its number of councillors, winning 11 seats in the Barking and Dagenham area, as well as a few elsewhere. The Green Party have won a few extra councillors.
<h3>&lt;a href="Charles%20Clarke%20loses%20Home%20Secretary%20position%20in%20Cabinet%20reshuffle%2C%20UK"&gt;Charles Clarke loses Home Secretary position in Cabinet reshuffle, UK&lt;/a&gt;</h3>

And here is more news, concerning the outcome of the local elections in England.

The United Kingdom Home Secretary Charles Clarke has lost his position in a Cabinet reshuffle by Tony Blair, on the morning after the Labour Party suffered losses in local elections across England. The news follows two weeks of headlines caused by the release of over 1000 foreign prisoners mistakenely released from prison at the end of their sentence rather than being deported.
Current Defence Secretary John Reid will replace Clarke as the new Home Secretary, and Jack Straw will become Commons leader.

&lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; is expanding military and economic connections in Latin America, including countries that are barred by a U.S. law from receiving military training and aid from the U.S. itself.

"China's profile in the region has been ratcheting up sharply," said Thomas Shannon, assistant secretary of State. 

U.S. Gen. Bantz Craddock, head of &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Southern%20Command"&gt;U.S. Southern Command&lt;/a&gt;, advised the House Armed Services Committee that China's military is increasing its involvement, "offering resources to cash-strapped militaries and security forces with no strings attached." 

According to Jose Ruiz, a spokesman for Southern Command, China has participated in exchanges of senior defense officials with &lt;a href="w%3AEcuador"&gt;Ecuador&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABolivia"&gt;Bolivia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AChile"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt; and has provided military aid and training to &lt;a href="w%3AJamaica"&gt;Jamaica&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AVenezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;.

Further, as reported by &lt;a href="w%3AJane%27s%20Defense%20Weekly"&gt;Jane's Defense Weekly&lt;/a&gt;, Caracas may be close to finalizing a deal with China to procure a new Chinese national defense communications network. The network is a satellite based system, incorporating strong encryption and other security measures.

According to &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; director &lt;a href="w%3APorter%20Goss"&gt;Porter Goss&lt;/a&gt; has resigned.

"He has led ably. [He] helped make this country a safer place. He has a five-year plan to increase the analysts and operatives. He honours the proud history of the CIA, an organization that is known for its secrecy and accountability. We've got to win the war on terror," said Bush in a press conference on Friday.

"I would like to report to you that the agency (CIA) is back on a very even keel and sailing well," said Goss.

The reasons for Goss's resignation are not yet known and as of the moment, the President has announced no replacement.

Goss was appointed as the CIA's director in 2004 and served as director for 19 months. He was previously an undercover agent for the organization and was also a member of the U.S. &lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; for 16 years.

<h1>4 year old Indian boy runs 40 miles in 7 hours</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=4%20year%20old%20Indian%20boy%20runs%2040%20miles%20in%207%20hours&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A four-year-old Indian boy from the eastern state of Orissa ran 65 kilometers (40 miles) continuously, setting an Indian record and possibly a world record as well.

Budhia Singh, a slum resident whose talent was discovered by a local coach, completed his run in seven hours and two minutes. Budhia had originally planned to run 43 miles, but doctors intervened at the 40-mile mark when he started showing signs of extreme exhaustion. 300 cadets from the Central Reserve Police Force, which plans to sponsor his upbringing, escorted Budhia, while thousands of onlookers cheered him on.

Officials from the Limca Book of Records, India's best-known record book, witnessed the run and said that Budhia's accomplishment would appear in the 2007 edition of the book.

Coach Biranchi Das says that he had seen Budhia's talent when Budhia accidentally entered a sports field without permission. Das had the boy run laps as punishment, but after five hours the boy was still running.

Human rights groups in India decried the run, saying that government officials endangered Budhia's life by allowing him to run in sweltering temperatures. "It is an act done so rashly or negligently to endanger human life or the personal safety of others as defined under section 336 of the Indian Penal Code," said Suhas Chakma, director of the Asian Center for Human Rights.

Das said that doctors had examined the boy and found nothing wrong.

"I loved running today. I can run as much as I want," Budhia said after the run.

&lt;a href="w%3ASingapore"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt; polling stations opened this morning at 8 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3ASingapore%20Standard%20Time"&gt;SGT&lt;/a&gt; (0000 &lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated%20Universal%20Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;) and are expected to run until 8 p.m. SGT (1200 UTC) tonight. Election results are expected from as early as 10 p.m. SGT (1400 UTC).

For the first time in 18 years, the incumbent &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Action%20Party"&gt;People's Action Party&lt;/a&gt; (PAP) has not won a walkover victory on Nomination Day on 26th April after opposition parties fielded candidates for 47 of the 84 seats. However, political analysts believe that the PAP will win a majority victory again.

This is the first parliamentary election for &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ALee%20Hsien%20Loong"&gt;Lee Hsien Loong&lt;/a&gt; after he took over from the former Prime Minister and current &lt;a href="w%3ASenior%20Minister"&gt;Senior Minister&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGoh%20Chok%20Tong"&gt;Goh Chok Tong&lt;/a&gt; stepped down in August 2004 in a planned leadership transition. Lee, 54, is the son of the &lt;a href="w%3AMinister%20Mentor"&gt;Minister Mentor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ALee%20Kuan%20Yew"&gt;Lee Kuan Yew&lt;/a&gt;, who was the Prime Minister of Singapore from 1959 to 1990.

As election surveys and &lt;a href="w%3Aexit%20poll"&gt;exit polls&lt;/a&gt; are banned in Singapore, it is difficult to determine how the political outcome might be. However, in the previous parliamentary elections in 2001, the PAP won 82 of 84 seats with 55 walkovers. The 2 remaining seats went to &lt;a href="w%3AChiam%20See%20Tong"&gt;Chiam See Tong&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3ASingapore%20Democratic%20Alliance"&gt;Singapore Democratic Alliance&lt;/a&gt; (SDA) and &lt;a href="w%3ALow%20Thia%20Khiang"&gt;Low Thia Khiang&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AWorkers%27%20Party%20of%20Singapore"&gt;Workers' Party&lt;/a&gt; (WP). A win of less than 80 of the 84 seats could prove an embarrassment for PM Lee.

The last nine days saw intense campaigning from the incumbent PAP, the SDA, the WP and the &lt;a href="w%3ASingapore%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;Singapore Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; (SDP). Several thousands of people attended the opposition rallies. Debates about the widening income gap, rising medical costs, job cuts, and calls for a less authoritarian political system dominated the campaigning.

Rescuers working to free miners trapped during the &lt;a href="w%3ABeaconsfield%20mine%20collapse"&gt;Beaconsfield mine collapse&lt;/a&gt; have moved to a slightly faster blasting method. The rescue effort was expected to conclude on Sunday, however due to rescuers encountering extremely hard rock, it has been once again delayed.

The vertical distance had previously been estimated at 1.5 metres, although rescuers believe it could be less with work being carried out overnight.

Todd Russell, 34, and Brant Webb, 37, have been underground for 13 nights after a minor earthquake triggered a rockfall in the &lt;a href="w%3ABeaconsfield%2C%20Tasmania"&gt;Beaconsfield&lt;/a&gt; Gold Mine. They survived because they were in a small cage when the collapse occurred. Their workmate Larry Knight, 44, died in the collapse, and his funeral is to be held in Launceston on Tuesday. His family members have delayed the funeral proceedings with the hope that the trapped miners will be freed and able to attend.

A cruise ship caught fire 32 km (20 miles) off the southeast coast of &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;. The blaze started in the engine-room of the Calypso, which had 708 passengers and crew onboard. 

The passengers were mainly Dutch.

Specialist firefighters transported by helicopter from the East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service tackled the fire.

It was tugged to Southampton by the Anglican Monarch, a tug boat jointly operated by England and France. The relieved passengers left to boat 16 hours after the fire started. 

"A team will be going onboard to assess the situation, so time will tell," said the Maritime and Coastguard Agency spokeswoman.

There were no causualties and no evacuation.

&lt;br style="clear:both;"&gt;

A car driven by an 80-year-old man has hit a five year old girl at a pedestrian crossing at Frenchs Forest Road in Seaforth, in &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;'s north at 4 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3ATime_in_Australia"&gt;AEST&lt;/a&gt;.

Sophie Delezio, 5, was rushed to Sydney Children’s Hospital. She has injuries to shoulder, jaw, numerous rib fractures but her most serious injury is bleeding around her left lung. She is expected to fully recover. She is expected to be in intensive care for three weeks. She is not expected to have to undergo surgery. A drug called NovoSeven is credited with stopping the bleeding around her lung.

The 80-year-old driver of the car that crashed into her has been arrested on negligent driving causing grievous bodily harm and failing to give way at a pedestrian crossing. He is expected to front Manly Court on 15 July 2006. 

Sophie was also involved in an accident involving a driver crashing into the Roundhouse Childcare Centre on December 15, 2003 causing her severe burns to 85% of her body. She also lost both feet, some fingers, and her right ear.

On Friday, &lt;a href="w%3ALuis%20Aragones"&gt;Luis Aragones&lt;/a&gt;, coach of the &lt;a href="w%3ASpain%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Spanish national football team&lt;/a&gt;, announced the preliminary squad for the World Cup finals in Germany. The pick was criticised by &lt;a href="w%3AGetafe%20CF"&gt;Getafe&lt;/a&gt; coach &lt;a href="w%3ABernd%20Schuster"&gt;Bernd Schuster&lt;/a&gt;.

The 27-man squad includes 7 players from the &lt;a href="w%3APremier%20League"&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt;, among them &lt;a href="w%3AChelsea%20F.C."&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt; left-back &lt;a href="w%3AAsier%20Del%20Horno"&gt;Asier Del Horno&lt;/a&gt;. Schuster claims that Getafe full-back &lt;a href="w%3AMariano%20Pernia"&gt;Mariano Pernia&lt;/a&gt; should have been picked instead. "All Del Horno has done this year is kick Barcelona's &lt;a href="w%3ALionel%20Messi"&gt;Lionel Messi&lt;/a&gt; in the Champions League," says Schuster, referring to Horno's red card in the Champions League game between Chelsea and &lt;a href="w%3AF.C.%20Barcelona"&gt;Barcelona&lt;/a&gt; back in February.

Pernia, who was born in &lt;a href="w%3AArgentina"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;, has dual citizenship, and could play for Spain in the World Cup finals. According to Schuster, Pernia had a successful season in La Liga, scoring ten goals.

Aragones must announce his 23-man squad by May 15.

Ten &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; soldiers were killed when a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACH-47%20Chinook"&gt;CH-47 Chinook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; helicopter crashed near the &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; border close to a landing zone in the Kunar province. A military spokesman said it crashed while conducting combat operations. The Soldiers were involved with Operation Mountain Lion, which is aimed at rooting out &lt;a href="al-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; and former &lt;a href="Afghan%20Taliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt; militants.

"The remains of all the 10 soldiers have been found and there are no survivors. There is no indication that the helicopter came down due to some enemy action. Additional aircraft and crews were also at the landing zone and confirmed that enemy forces did not cause the crash," said Lt. Tamara D. Lawrence, a spokeswoman for the U.S. military.

However; Muhamad Hanif, a Taliban spokesman, said that the crash was the result of the Taliban. He also said that advanced weaponry was used to shoot down helicopters.

"We have no indication that that happened," said Lawrence in response to Hanif's claim. "The crash occurred in a very mountainous terrain and the landing zone was very difficult. It was a mountain-top landing zone. There were various weather factors that could have come into play…. There were high winds. We are investigating any possible causes for the accident but there were no enemy actions detected at the scene," she added.

In June of 2005, Taliban forces brought down a Chinook in the same province, which killed all American soldiers onboard. According to the military, rocket-propelled grenades were used in that attack.

There are at least 20,000 coalition forces in Afghanistan; 18,000 of them are American soldiers. At least 2,500 of the American soldiers are also involved with Operation Mountain Lion.

Tension and battles between &lt;a href="w%3AGreek"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; police and &lt;a href="w%3Aanarchist"&gt;anarchist&lt;/a&gt; demonstrators took place in the centre of &lt;a href="w%3AAthens%2C%20Greece"&gt;Athens, Greece&lt;/a&gt;, during the anti-war demonstration of the 4th &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Social%20Forum"&gt;European Social Forum&lt;/a&gt; which is taking place in the Greek capital, from 4 to 7 of &lt;a href="w%3AMay%202006"&gt;May 2006&lt;/a&gt;. The march of the approximately 1,000 anarchists ended with clashes between groups of anarchists and police. Riot police used tear gas, while a branch of a Greek bank, a fast-food store and around 50 shop windows in central Athens were damaged.

The anti-war demonstration rally staged by the 4th European Social Forum started today morning with socialist politicians, peace and environmental groups from Greece and all over the world attending. The &lt;a href="w%3ASynaspismos"&gt;Synaspismos&lt;/a&gt; party, a coalition of Social Movements and Ecology Parties of Greece organized the demonstration.

Thousands of people from Europe, Asia, and America, members of Greek labour unions and non-government organisations took part in the march together with representatives of the Steering Committee. According to the European Social Forum and the organizers, there were approximately 80,000 demonstrators.

A group of youths set off clashes outside the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; embassy, the War Museum, the Ministry of Foreign Ministry and the Parliament. They then headed to Ermou Street, where they vandalised several shops. Riot police arrested more than 15 people. Further small-scale incidents were reported shortly after 5pm near the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; embassy and the Athens Police Headquarters, when a group of anarchists hurled Molotov cocktails against police officers and cars.

A British military helicopter crashed in &lt;a href="w%3ABasra"&gt;Basra&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday killing four crew members. Local Iraqis filled the surrounding streets celebrating the crash before a clash occurred with British troops upon their arrival.

"We can confirm it was a British military helicopter that has crashed and an investigation is ongoing," a British military spokesman in London said.

An AFP reporter on the scene heard from a local policeman that the helicopter was hit by a rocket fired by local militia.

According to Basra police spokesman Lieut. Colonel Kareem al-Zaidi, "a multinational forces helicopter was hit by a rocket and went down on houses in central Basra". He also added that fire-fighters later found the four British crew members charred in the wreckage and that no causalities on the ground resulted from the impact.

Earlier, an AFP journalist sighted the downed British military helicopter and reported he saw two burnt crew members after the impact which caused the helicopter to burst into flames.

After the crash, it is reported that hundreds of people from the local area, many of them youths, celebrated the helicopter's downing in the streets surrounding the crash.

On the arrival of British troops at the scene, including two tanks and one land rover, the crowd allegedly attacked the British forces with rocks, debris and petrol bombs.

A British spokeswoman, Capt. Kelly Goodall, said British soldiers who responded came "under attack by a variety of weapons, including small arms fire, petrol bombs, as well as blast bombs and stone."

British soldiers used foam to extinguish their vehicles, escaping uninjured.

Members of the crowd allegedly shouted slogans such as "victory for the Mehdi Army!" and "we are all soldiers of al-Sayed" in support of local militants lead by Shi'ite Muslim cleric Moqtada al-Sadr.

During the conflict, An AFP photographer was shot and wounded in the leg by a rubber-coated bullet. Contrary to reports from the British defence department, the journalist said that British soldiers raised their rifles and shot one man dead and also later shot the driver of a car in a local street dead.

As conflict was escalated, British and Shi'ite gunmen exchanged fire which resulted in the addition deaths of four Iraqis including two children. An estimated 30 civilians were reportedly injured in the melee.

An Iraqi policeman in Basra said the helicopter was downed by a rocket and said four Iraqi civilians, including two children, were killed and another 19 wounded in the fighting.

Military forces later cordoned off the scene and imposed a curfew on the surrounding area in Basra.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Tornadoes%20cause%20millions%20in%20damages%20in%20Waco%2C%20Texas&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Early Saturday morning winds up to 90 miles per hour struck &lt;a href="w%3AWaco%2C%20Texas"&gt;Waco, Texas&lt;/a&gt; and central &lt;a href="w%3AMcLennan%20County"&gt;McLennan County&lt;/a&gt;, United States, causing widespread damage and leaving many households without electricity.

No deaths or serious injuries have been reported; however, there is a tremendous amount of damage in 15 areas of the city, leading Mayor Virgina DuPuy to declare the city a disaster area.

The hardest hit area was Franklin Avenue, where the Coca-Cola bottling plant's roof was peeled open as if by a giant can-opener. There were Sprite bottles spread out onto the street. The nearby Furniture Row shopping center was also hit hard. Some furniture was found as far as three-quarters of a mile away. Other hard-hit areas were Robinson, Hewitt, Woodway, and Speegleville. Densely populated Inner Waco was spared of any catastrophic damage, though hundreds, and possibly thousands, of trees have fallen, and roofs destroyed.

The main concern is restoring power to over 23,000 households and businesses. Many gas stations and grocery stores in the disaster areas were closed until power is restored. Those that remained open have had to throw out all perishable items. Also of concern is getting electricity to those with medical needs. The city has provided help to those without power at the Dewey Recreation Center.

The storm is the hardest to hit the area since the tornado that struck on May 11, 1953, which tore through downtown and killed 114 people.

Waco has seen more than its share of tornadoes recently. Only a week ago, an F1 tornado damaged many houses along Orchid and Kendall Lanes. No people were injured, though two horses were killed when their stable collapsed.

The National Weather Service confirmed this morning's winds were a F2 tornado, where wind speeds may have reached 115 miles per hour in some locations.

<h1>PAP returned to power in 2006 Parliamentary Elections, Singapore</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=PAP%20returned%20to%20power%20in%202006%20Parliamentary%20Elections%2C%20Singapore&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The incumbent &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Action%20Party"&gt;People's Action Party&lt;/a&gt; (PAP) has retained its power in the &lt;a href="w%3ASingapore"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt; parliament after getting 66.6% of the valid votes. It maintained 82 of the available 84 seats after securing 45 of the 47 contested seats, together with 37 of the seats that it won on Nomination Day on 26th April through walkovers. The opposition parties &lt;a href="w%3ASingapore%20Democratic%20Alliance"&gt;Singapore Democratic Alliance&lt;/a&gt; (SDA) and &lt;a href="w%3AWorkers%27%20Party%20of%20Singapore"&gt;Workers' Party&lt;/a&gt; (WP) also retained one seat each.

Despite having more seats contested in this election compared to the &lt;a href="w%3ASingapore%20general%20election%2C%202001"&gt;2001 General Elections&lt;/a&gt;, the breakdown of seats remains unchanged from the previous election. However, the PAP only won a reduced majority, having only 66.6% of the valid votes compared to the 75% that it won in the previous election because of the spectre of terrorism and a poor economy then.

The PAP took all 7 contested &lt;a href="w%3AGroup%20Representation%20Constituencies"&gt;Group Representation Constituencies&lt;/a&gt; (GRC) in Ang Mo Kio, Aljunied, East Coast, Jalan Besar, Tampines, Pasir Ris-Punggol and Sembawang, making up 38 of the seats. It also took seven of nine of the single seats in Bukit Panjang, Chua Chu Kang, Joo Chiat, MacPherson, Nee Soon Central, Nee Soon East and Yio Chu Kang.

Among the opposition parties, the WP had the best showing, taking 16.34% of the valid votes, which is an improvement over the 2.7% that in received in the previous election. In the &lt;a href="w%3AHougang"&gt;Hougang&lt;/a&gt; ward, the incumbent &lt;a href="w%3ALow%20Thia%20Khiang"&gt;Low Thia Khiang&lt;/a&gt; of the WP took 13,987 (62.74%) of the votes, defeating &lt;a href="w%3AEric%20Low%20Siak%20Meng"&gt;Eric Low Siak Meng&lt;/a&gt; of the PAP who only managed 8,306 (37.26%) of the votes while the remaining 277 votes were voided. The opposition win in Hougang is a big disappointment for PAP, which had dangled a carrot of some S$100 million in housing upgrading grants. 

Despite losing all of its GRC contests, its best performance was in the controversial and hotly-contested Aljunied, where it took 43.9% of the votes against &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Yeo"&gt;George Yeo&lt;/a&gt;'s PAP team who won 56.08% of the votes. Just a few days before, &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Gomez"&gt;James Gomez&lt;/a&gt; of the WP was heavily criticised by the PAP for a non-submission of a certificate proving of his status as a minority. It then became a heavily debated issue in the campaigning until the PAP decided that it should move on to more important issues. Opposition position poster girl &lt;a href="w%3ASylvia%20Lim"&gt;Sylvia Lim&lt;/a&gt; of the WP Aljunied team seems to be the most likely to be appointed as a &lt;a href="w%3ANon-Constituency%20Member%20of%20Parliament"&gt;Non-Constituency Member of Parliament&lt;/a&gt; (NCMP) as she got the highest non-winning number of votes.

&lt;a href="w%3AChiam%20See%20Tong"&gt;Chiam See Tong&lt;/a&gt; of the SDA beat PAP's &lt;a href="w%3ASitoh%20Yih%20Pin"&gt;Sitoh Yih Pin&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3APotong%20Pasir"&gt;Potong Pasir&lt;/a&gt; ward with a margin of 8,242 (55.84%) over 6,518 (44.16%) votes. The remaining 186 of the votes were voided. This is an improvement over the previous election where he only won 52.4% of the votes. However, they did not manage to win any other seats. They received more than 30 percent votes for the seats that they did not win.

Contrary to the performance of the other opposition parties, the &lt;a href="w%3ASingapore%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;Singapore Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; (SDP) performed poorly in this election compared to the previous election. It lost all the 7 seats that it contested and only received 4.06% of the valid votes compared to 8.1% in 2001. SDP blamed the losses on the ban of political &lt;a href="w%3Apodcast"&gt;podcasts&lt;/a&gt;. SDP also alleged that the media waged a relentless campaign against it and that the lawsuit against it by the PAP prevented it from raising the issue involving the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Kidney%20Foundation%20Singapore%20scandal"&gt;National Kidney Foundation scandal&lt;/a&gt;.

Other reporters witnessed Carleton going red in the face, walking a short distance then collapsing to the ground. A few minutes earlier Carleton asked Beaconsfield Mine Manager Matthew Gill about the safety of the mine.

Ambulance officers worked to revive Carleton for over 25 minutes, before he was rushed to hospital. He was pronounced dead upon arrival at Launceston hospital.

Carleton had a history of heart problems, which includes a heart attack in 2003 and a bypass operation in 1988. He was also diagnosed with prostate cancer in early 2005.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Sudan%20will%20welcome%20UN%20Peacekeepers%20in%20Darfur&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The Government of &lt;a href="w%3ASudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt; has expressed that the &lt;a href="w%3ADarfur"&gt;Darfur&lt;/a&gt; Peace Accord with main rebel group, &lt;a href="w%3ASudan%20Liberation%20Army"&gt;Sudan Liberation Army&lt;/a&gt;, led by Minni Menawi, can overturn the previous rejection of &lt;a href="w%3AUN"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; Peacekeepers. So far, only &lt;a href="w%3AAfrican%20Union"&gt;African Union&lt;/a&gt; Peacekeepers were allowed in Darfur.

"The Sudan government will be open for any assistance," Bakri Mulah, secretary-general for external affairs in Sudan's Information Ministry, said in &lt;a href="w%3AKhartoum"&gt;Khartoum&lt;/a&gt;, Sudan.

In &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="John%20R.%20Bolton"&gt;John R. Bolton&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AUS"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; ambassador, on Saturday welcomed Khartoum's new willingness to accept a UN peacekeeping force to take over from AU soldiers in the Darfur region. He cited the Sudanese government representatives' comments to indicate they were now willing to accept the UN force. He said, " We view this as a very encouraging sign, the first positive outcome from the Abuja peace agreement. "

In the meantime, top UN humanitarian official Jan Egeland has arrived in Sudan to review the situation in the Darfur region. He is expected to visit southern Darfur, where fighting has broken out recently. It is the first visit by a UN official to the region since the peace deal was signed.

He said that access for aid workers in Darfur was at its worst level in two years. "At the moment Darfur is slowly being strangled, it's dying in front of us, half of the population now has become war victims...so I believe, yes, we are turning the corner, but the whole world has to put pressure on the parties." said Mr Egeland, the UN's Emergency Relief Co-ordinator. 

Earlier, &lt;a href="w%3AUN%20Secretary%20General"&gt;UN Secretary General&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AKofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt; requested Khartoum to issue visas to his team of assessors so they could plan for the deployment of an international peacekeeping force to replace the 7,000 African Union troops later in the year. The AU troops, now running out of funds, had largely been ineffective in stopping atrocities, leaving millions to struggle in camps with little food or water. While details for a UN peacekeeping force are finalised, the US diplomat said the US had asked &lt;a href="w%3ARwanda"&gt;Rwanda&lt;/a&gt; to send in some 1,200 troops to supplement the AU forces.

In a recent development, an unknown assailant shot a Spanish United Nations Aid worker in &lt;a href="w%3AChad"&gt;Chad&lt;/a&gt;. She is working in the eastern part of Chad to assist the refugees from Darfur region. 2,00,000 refugees have crossed the border to escape from the violence in Darfur. She is in critical condition.

<h1>Iran says it may withdraw from Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Iran%20says%20it%20may%20withdraw%20from%20Nuclear%20Non-Proliferation%20Treaty&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
In a letter to the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;'s Parliament has said it may have to withdraw from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20Non-Proliferation%20Treaty"&gt;Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; if pressure to end its nuclear program escalates.

The letter to UN Secretary General &lt;a href="Kofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt; stated that if the issues with Iran's nuclear program are not settled by peaceful methods, then "there will be no option for the parliament but to ask the government to withdraw its signature."

"Should the UN secretary general and &lt;a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council"&gt;Security Council&lt;/a&gt; members not fulfill their crucial duties in settling arguments, there will be no choice for the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMajlis%20of%20Iran"&gt;Majlis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; but to demand the government withdraw the ratification of the additional protocol and put on its agenda a review of Article 10 of the NPT," said the letter, signed by at least 160 deputies.

In the Non-Proliferation Treaty, Article 10 states that a country can withdraw its signatories from the treaty if the interests of the country have been compromised. In 2003, &lt;a href="North%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt; withdrew from the treaty for the same reason.

"We will not accept any resolution that is against our rights. Any action by the Security Council will have a negative influence on our cooperation with the agency. The involvement of the Security Council will direct the path of cooperation towards confrontation. It's obvious that the Security Council should not take any action that it is not capable of dealing with later because we will not refrain from our rights," said Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hamid Reza Asefi in a press conference on Sunday.

"Suspension and pause is not on the agenda at all, and the Security Council should not do something that will get it into trouble later on," and "intervention by the Security Council in this issue is completely illegal," added Asefi.

United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan still urges Iran and the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; to hold direct talks. According to journalist and anti-nuclear-weapons activist &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APraful%20Bidwai"&gt;Praful Bidwai&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Iran is "keen to reach a deal or compromise on the nuclear issue" and "numerous governmental and non-governmental experts" in Iran believe that there is "fairly broad agreement" that a compromise proposal could be negotiated which would be politically acceptable in Iran. 

Annan stated, "If everybody - all stakeholders and key players - were around the table, I think it would be possible to work out a package that would satisfy the concerns of everybody. Should they (Iran) be offered a diplomatic package allowing them to pursue nuclear energy for peaceful ends, and they resist that, how do they explain it to the world?"

Asefi also said that Iran isn't prepared to discuss it's nuclear program with the United States "one-on-one".

"The U.S. isn't prepared to have talks on a one-to-one equal basis. They are following the politics of threat. So under these conditions we see no necessity to start talks with them," said Asefi. 

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARaw%20Story"&gt;Raw Story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; earlier made claims from unnamed intelligence sources that some parts of the US administration are opposed to diplomatic activities with Iran. It claimed that US vice-president &lt;a href="Dick%20Cheney"&gt;Dick Cheney&lt;/a&gt; and Secretary of Defense &lt;a href="Donald%20Rumsfeld"&gt;Donald Rumsfeld&lt;/a&gt; are carrying out "an ongoing attempt ... to squash diplomatic activities" and using &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AManucher%20Ghorbanifar"&gt;Manucher Ghorbanifar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a key figure in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIran-Contra%20Affair"&gt;Iran-Contra Affair&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , to monitor and report on "any interaction and attempts at negotiations between Iranian officials and US ambassador to Iraq, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AZalmay%20Khalilzad"&gt;Zalmay Khalilzad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ."

The treaty was opened for signatures in 1968 and in 1970 entered into force. There are 187 signatures on the treaty.

&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Sultan%27s%20Elephant"&gt;The Sultan's Elephant&lt;/a&gt;, a giant piece of street theatre by French group &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20de%20Luxe"&gt;Royal de Luxe&lt;/a&gt;, has been entertaining Londoners over the course of this weekend. The show started on Thursday, when a 'crashed rocket' was in place at Victoria Place. On Friday, an oversized marionette of a young girl emerged from the rocket and met with the giant mechanised elephant. Over the course of the weekend, these two giant puppets have been parading around London streets, closed especially for the event.

Whilst Friday remained hot and sunny, the weekend turned wetter, but the rain didn't seem to put off the crowds, some of who received a second soaking from the elephant's trunk! The elephant stopped at Trafalger Square over lunchtime on the Saturday, before parading to &lt;a href="w%3AHorse%20Guard%27s%20Parade"&gt;Horse Guard's Parade&lt;/a&gt;, where seating had been specially erected around a giant stage.

Over ten puppeteers operate the elephant, made mostly of wood, using a complex arrangement of hydraulics and motors. The elephant moves its feet, wags its tails, waves and squirts water from its trunk, flaps its ears, blinks, and can even open its mouth to reveal a moving tongue. The girl marionette is held on a big frame, and was given a ride on the elephant's trunk using a crane. The girl has been seen licking a giant lollipop, and even do a wee on the road.

The spectacle will end on Sunday with a grand finale.

&lt;a href="Iran%20says%20it%20may%20withdraw%20from%20Nuclear%20Non-Proliferation%20Treaty"&gt;Iran says it may withdraw from Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty&lt;/a&gt;

Iran

In a letter to the United Nations, Iran's Parliament has said it may have to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty if pressure to end its nuclear program escalates.
The letter to UN Secretary General Kofi Annan stated that if the issues with Iran's nuclear program are not settled by peaceful methods, then "there will be no option for the parliament but to ask the government to withdraw its signature."

&lt;a href="Human%20Rights%20Watch%20implicates%20600%2B%20in%20war%20prisoner%20abuse"&gt;Human Rights Watch implicates 600+ in war prisoner abuse&lt;/a&gt;

United States

A U.S. Army lieutenant colonel is expected to be charged soon in connection with the abuse of detainees at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. The news came on the same day human rights groups released a report charging that abuse of prisoners in U.S. military custody overseas has been widespread and only limited steps have been taken to investigate and punish those involved.

&lt;a href="Iraqis%20celebrate%20deaths%20of%20British%20troops"&gt;Iraqis celebrate deaths of British troops&lt;/a&gt;

Iraq

A British military helicopter crashed in Basra on Saturday killing four crew members. Local Iraqis filled the surrounding streets celebrating the crash before a clash occurred with British troops upon their arrival.
"We can confirm it was a British military helicopter that has crashed and an investigation is ongoing," a British military spokesman in London said.
An AFP reporter on the scene heard from a local policeman that the helicopter was hit by a rocket fired by local militia.

&lt;a href="Sudan%20will%20welcome%20UN%20Peacekeepers%20in%20Darfur"&gt;Sudan will welcome UN Peacekeepers in Darfur&lt;/a&gt;

Sudan

Sudan Government has expressed that Darfur Peace Acccord with main rebel group, Sudan Liberation Army, led by Minni Menawi, can overturn the previous rejection of UN Peacekeepers. So far, only African Union Peacekeepers were allowed in Darfur.
"The Sudan government will be open for any assistance," Bakri Mulah, secretary-general for external affairs in Sudan's Information Ministry, said in Khartoum, Sudan.

Singapore

The incumbent People's Action Party (PAP) has retained its power in the Singapore parliament after getting 66.6% of the valid votes. It maintained 82 of the available 84 seats after securing 45 of the 47 contested seat, together with 37 of the seats that it won on Nomination Day on 26th April through walkovers. The opposition parties Singapore Democratic Alliance (SDA) and Workers' Party (WP) also retained one seat each.
Despite having more seats contested in this election compared to the 2001 General Elections, the breakdown of seats remains unchanged from the previous election. However, the PAP only won a reduced majority, having only 66.6% of the valid votes compared to the 75% that it won in the previous election because of the spectre of terrorism and a poor economy then.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APsiphon"&gt;Psiphon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is being launched the end of this month as a highly anticipated software program that allows &lt;a href="Internet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt; users inside &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Saudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Myanmar"&gt;Myanmar&lt;/a&gt; (formerly Burma), to get around censorship without being detected by the censors.

Three &lt;a href="University%20of%20Toronto"&gt;University of Toronto&lt;/a&gt; students, Ron Deibert, Nart Villeneuve, and Michael Hull combined their political passion and love of free expression to create the software program that is attracting attention globally from people like Sharon Hom, executive director of New York-based "Human Rights in China".

"We've been trying to circumvent both the firewalls and the censorship surveillance," said Hom; "So it's something we are very, very interested in."

"It's enormous," says Deibert who directs the Citizen Lab at the U of T's Munk Centre for International Studies, where the threesome works. "If it works the way we hope it does and is distributed worldwide, it will have a huge impact on freedom of speech."

According to Andrew Chung of the ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AToronto%20Star"&gt;Toronto Star&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤, "China blocks countless websites, from ones featuring porn to those devoted to &lt;a href="Falun%20Gong"&gt;Falun Gong&lt;/a&gt;, a spiritual movement banned in China. Anything on human rights is off-limits. Same for democracy." Although the precise &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20censorship%20in%20mainland%20China"&gt;material filtered&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; out by the Chinese government is dynamic and more specific than this implies, any censorship of the internet is seen by some free-speech advocates a gross violation of human rights. 

The Citizen Lab taking on powerful censors such as China is like the people of Lilliput taking on Gulliver. "It's a huge uphill battle," Deibert agrees. "The trajectory in terms of global politics is toward greater state control (of the Internet). I see closure everywhere."

Villeneuve, 31, shrugs his shoulders and smirks, "It just seems like the right thing to do."

The Citizen Lab even has "black boxes," mini-computers that can be "planted" discreetly inside these countries to run the tests. "This kind of research is illegal in almost every country we do it in."

Psiphon is supposed to be able to effectively turn anyone's personal computer into a proxy server. The censored user may then connect to the computer running Psiphon and accesses banned content from there, all out of the view of censors. Psiphon data is also encrypted and moves globally on a network reserved for secure financial transactions, so the Censor wouldn't be able to tell a Psiphon request from a MasterCard purchase.

"We're making the Internet run the way it's supposed to," said Villeneuve; "Because people have broken it."

One person is dead and 13 others, including 5 members of &lt;a href="w%3AGarda%20S%C3%ADoch%C3%A1na"&gt;the Garda Síochána&lt;/a&gt;, Ireland's police force, are injured following the pursuit of a stolen bus throughout the south of &lt;a href="w%3ADublin"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt; city and county. 

A driver who was not authorised to take the vehicle early in the morning of May 7 stole the coach from the yard of private hire operator Dualway. The bus was later located at &lt;a href="w%3ADublin%20Heuston%20railway%20station"&gt;Dublin Heuston railway station&lt;/a&gt; by the coach company, where the driver attempted to run over the son of the owner of Dualway.

The driver then returned to the Dualway depot in &lt;a href="w%3ARathcoole"&gt;Rathcoole&lt;/a&gt; in what developed in to a high speed pursuit involving up to 20 patrol cars and a police helicopter. The Gardaí fired several shots at the driver's tires in an attempt to stop the car, as well as laying tacks. The bus was driven down the wrong side of the &lt;a href="w%3AN7%20road"&gt;N7 Naas road&lt;/a&gt;, where it collided with a number of cars, killing a female driver, and rammed five Garda patrol cars that were blocking the road. The driver was apprehended and arrested at the Dualway depot after crashing the bus.

Sections of the N7 as well as surrounding roads were closed following the incident for forensic examinations, and the &lt;a href="w%3ALuas"&gt;Luas&lt;/a&gt; tram services were severely curtailed.

This weekend the fifth Grand Prix weekend of the &lt;a href="w%3AFormula-1"&gt;Formula 1&lt;/a&gt; season, the Grand Prix of Europe, took place in &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="w%3AN%C3%BCrburgring"&gt;Nürburgring&lt;/a&gt; track. Unlike the previous race, &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Schumacher"&gt;Michael Schumacher&lt;/a&gt; was only second on the grid after qualifying on Saturday, losing out the pole position to &lt;a href="w%3AFernando%20Alonso"&gt;Fernando Alonso&lt;/a&gt;, the first Renault pilot. However, in the last part of the race, &lt;a href="w%3ASchumi"&gt;"Schumi"&lt;/a&gt; outpaced Alonso on the track and took the lead thanks to some fast laps with the track free of traffic while Alonso took his final pitstop. The German passed the checkered flag and won for the 86th time in his Formula 1 career.

In spite of his second "defeat", Fernando Alonso stands in the lead of the drivers championship, 13 points ahead his closest competitor, Michael Schumacher.

&lt;a href="w%3AFelipe%20Massa"&gt;Felipe Massa&lt;/a&gt;, the second &lt;a href="w%3AFerrari"&gt;Ferrari&lt;/a&gt; driver, was third. This achievement is the first podium of his Formula 1 career. 

&lt;a href="w%3AKimi%20R%C3%A4ikk%C3%B6nen"&gt;Kimi Räikkönen&lt;/a&gt; struggled with the car this weekend, but ended up finishing the weekend with a fourth place. Kimi pushed hard on the closing laps and closed the gap to Felipe Massa to +0.4 seconds upon crossing the finish line.

&lt;a href="w%3ANico%20Rosberg"&gt;Nico Rosberg&lt;/a&gt;, the "discovery of the season", had a nice race for the Williams Formula 1 team. He finished 7th.

<h1>March against new French copyright law</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=March%20against%20new%20French%20copyright%20law&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;a href="%3Aw%3AParis"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; -
Protesters marched denouncing the new &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Acopyright"&gt;copyright&lt;/a&gt; bill, known as &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ADADVSI"&gt;DADVSI&lt;/a&gt;.
Opponents to the bill contend that the broad civil and criminal penalties that it enacts in order to fight illegal online copying of copyrighted works will in fact have a &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Achilling%20effect"&gt;chilling effect&lt;/a&gt; on a variety of unrelated developments, especially in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Afree%20software"&gt;free software&lt;/a&gt;. More than 160,000 people signed the anti-DADVSI petition from &lt;a href="http%3A//www.eucd.info"&gt;EUCD.info&lt;/a&gt;, a watchdog group fighting developments of the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEU%20Copyright%20Directive"&gt;EU Copyright Directive&lt;/a&gt;.
The protest, uniting elected officials, representatives from computing and Internet organisations, political groups, and simple citizens, walked in a festive and peaceful atmosphere from the Place de la Bastille (site of the former royal prison) to the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AMinister%20of%20Culture%20%28France%29"&gt;Ministry of Culture&lt;/a&gt;. It was organized by a variety of associations, including &lt;a href="http%3A//stopdrm.info/"&gt;StopDRM&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http%3A//www.april.org/"&gt;APRIL&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href="http%3A//www.odebi.org"&gt;the Odebi league&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.audionautes.net"&gt;Audionautes&lt;/a&gt;, various free software and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ALinux"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; user groups, and sponsored by the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AFrench%20Communist%20Party"&gt;French Communist Party&lt;/a&gt; and its young adult affiliate organisation, the youngs of the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AFrench%20Socialist%20Party"&gt;French Socialist Party&lt;/a&gt;, the youngs of the centrist &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AUnion%20for%20French%20Democracy"&gt;Union for French Democracy&lt;/a&gt;, the young Greens. All the sponsors of this march are listed &lt;a href="http%3A//stopdrm.info/7mai.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Depending on estimates, between 300 and 800 people marched, a low number by French standards.
The DADVSI law, among other issues, enacts an extensive protection of copyrighted content online and a protection of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Adigital%20rights%20management"&gt;digital rights management&lt;/a&gt; techniques, including civil and criminal penalties for help in circumventing them. Opponents contend that the bill, depending on how it is amended in the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AFrench%20Senate"&gt;French Senate&lt;/a&gt;, could in effect criminalise the writing of players compatible with new online distribution formats for music, video or even text, and thus make such content unplayable on systems such as &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ALinux"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt;, thereby generating a monopoly for established suppliers.

Supporters of the bill, such as cinema and recording industry groups, contend that strong measures are needed to thwart online copying, which, according to them, is responsible for important losses of sales and revenue. They deny the risks for free software and other freedoms, claiming that, despite vague provisions, the law will be enforced wisely by the judiciary. They claim that new online legal commercial downloading platforms will flourish when peer-to-peer copying has stopped.

The bill is due to be examined in the Senate this week. Then, under the fast track procedure requested by the government, it may be signed into law by president &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AJacques%20Chirac"&gt;Jacques Chirac&lt;/a&gt; after a mixed commission merges the text from the Senate and the lower house of Parliament, the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AFrench%20National%20Assembly"&gt;National Assembly&lt;/a&gt;. Opponents have already indicated they would mount a constitutional challenge before the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AConstitutional%20Council%20of%20France"&gt;Constitutional Council&lt;/a&gt;. The bill, when it was examined by the National Assembly, proved divisive; the ruling &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AUnion%20for%20a%20Popular%20Movement"&gt;UMP&lt;/a&gt; party was split on the issue, some even sponsoring a "legal licence" which would enable French Internet users to copy copyrighted content legally, provided they would pay a flat fee which would be split between the rights holder.
Protesters, as well as deputies from all parties, contend that major lobbies influenced the bill’s passage. Some amendments were nicknamed ♡❤&lt;a href="%3Aw%3AVivendi%20Universal"&gt;Vivendi Universal&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, from the name of a major record company that allegedly suggested it. Protesters recalled that Minister of Culture &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARenaud%20Donnedieu%20de%20Vabres"&gt;Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres&lt;/a&gt; was convicted of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Amoney%20laundering"&gt;money laundering&lt;/a&gt; in 2004.

A report by the &lt;a href="w%3AMinistry%20of%20Defence%20%28United%20Kingdom%29"&gt;Ministry of Defence&lt;/a&gt; investigating the possible existence of &lt;a href="w%3AUnidentified%20Flying%20Object"&gt;Unidentified Flying Objects&lt;/a&gt; (UFOs) was released today. The report was confidentially published in 2000 and has come to light after Dr David Clarke of Sheffield Hallam University requested it citing the &lt;a href="w%3AFreedom%20of%20Information%20Act"&gt;Freedom of Information Act&lt;/a&gt;.

The report concludes that "no evidence exists to suggest that the phenomena seen are hostile or under any type of control, other than that of natural physical forces ... There is no evidence that 'solid' objects exist which could cause a collision hazard".

Explanations such as &lt;a href="w%3AMeteor"&gt;meteors&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AAurora%20%28astronomy%29"&gt;aurora borealis&lt;/a&gt; effect are accredited as the cause of most, if not all, UFO sightings.

<h1>Soft drink foes cheer victory, lament remaining junk foods in schools</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Soft%20drink%20foes%20cheer%20victory%2C%20lament%20remaining%20junk%20foods%20in%20schools&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Last week’s announcement that most soda manufacturers will stop selling their sugary products in U.S. schools did not mention that avoiding lawsuits was part of the motivation for the self-imposed ban. Some of those who threatened legal action to stop the soda sales are patting themselves on the back over the agreement, while lamenting that the deal did not go far enough, and now plan to press for more restrictions.

“Though there is room for improvement &amp;mdash; sugary “sports” drinks still will be sold in schools, for instance &amp;mdash; this voluntary agreement is certainly good enough that CSPI will drop its planned lawsuit against &lt;a href="w%3ACoca-Cola"&gt;Coca-Cola&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APepsiCo"&gt;PepsiCo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACadbury-Schweppes"&gt;Cadbury-Schweppes&lt;/a&gt; and their bottlers,” said Michael F. Jacobson, the executive director of the &lt;a href="w%3ACenter%20for%20Science%20in%20the%20Public%20Interest"&gt;Center for Science in the Public Interest&lt;/a&gt; . “I hope this settlement contributes to the momentum that is building in Congress for legislation that would require USDA to update its standards for foods sold outside of school meals. That would enable USDA to eliminate the sale of candy, cookies, French fries, potato chips, and other snack foods, as well as sports drinks, that are standard fare in school vending machines and stores.” 

In the wake of the announcement of the agreement by the three largest soft drink companies, their bottlers and the public health advocacy group, the Alliance for a Healthier Generation, Jacobson thanked his team of litigators for “negotiating effectively with the soft-drink industry over the past six months, and for demonstrating that the judicial system can play an important role in spurring public health advances.”

Richard Daynard, a law professor and president of the Public Health Advocacy Institute, which threatened the soft-drink industry with lawsuits, said in an institute press release, “The industry agreement with the Clinton Foundation and &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Heart%20Association"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt; comes after sustained pressure from potential litigation and negotiations with public health groups and their lawyers. It is a credit to the role of litigation and the legal system as a component of effective public health strategy."

"This agreement demonstrates the potential of public health litigation to help control the obesity epidemic," he said.

In an email exchange with the &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Logan%20Courier"&gt;James Logan Courier&lt;/a&gt;, Margo Wootan, director of Nutrition Policy for the Center for Science in the Public interest, said, "Last week's announcement that soft drink companies will pull all sugary sodas from schools is great step toward improving school foods. This agreement is the culmination of the tremendous national momentum on improving school foods -- from the local policies (in LA, NYC, Chicago, Philadelphia, DC, etc.), state bills (in 2005, 200 bills were introduced in 40 states to get soda and junk foods out of schools), the strong bipartisan bill pending in the U.S. Congress, and threats of litigation against soda companies."

"While today's agreement is a huge step forward, it is by no means the last step" wrote Wootan, " We still have a lot of work to do to improve school foods."

The agreement, announced Wednesday morning by the &lt;a href="w%3AWilliam%20J.%20Clinton"&gt;William J. Clinton&lt;/a&gt; Foundation, means that the nation’s biggest beverage distributors, and the American Beverage Association, will pull their soda products from vending machines and cafeterias in schools serving about 35 million students, according to the Alliance for a Healthier Generation, a joint initiative between the Clinton Foundation and the American Heart Association.

Under the agreement, high schools will still be able to purchase drinks such as diet and unsweetened teas, diet sodas, sports drinks, flavored water, seltzer and low-calorie sports drinks for resale to students.

The companies plan to stop soda sales at 75 percent of the nation's public schools by the 2008-2009 school year, and at all schools in the following school year. The speed of the changes will depend in part on school districts' willingness to change their contracts with the beverage distributors.

Some food activists criticized the deal for not going far enough and undermining efforts to go further.

Michele Simon, the director of the Center for Informed Food Choices, based in Oakland, Ca., called the deal “bogus” and a “PR stunt” by “Big Cola” in an effort to “sugar coat it’s image.”

“This announcement could potentially undermine ongoing grassroots efforts, state legislation, and other enforceable policies,” wrote Simon in an &lt;a href="http%3A//www.commondreams.org/views06/0505-32.htm"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; at www.commondreams.org,” For example, in Massachusetts where a stronger bill is pending, a local advocate is worried about the adverse impact, since legislators could easily think that Clinton has taken care of the problem and ignore the bill. What was already an uphill battle—getting schools and legislatures to take this problem seriously—was just made worse, not better, by this bogus agreement.

“Even from a health standpoint, the deal is hardly impressive. Diet soda full of artificial sweeteners, sports drinks high in sugar, and other empty-calorie beverages with zero nutritional value are still allowed in high schools,” Simon wrote, “Also, parents concerned about soda advertising in schools will not be pleased with the agreement. Not a word is mentioned about the ubiquitous marketing children are subjected to daily in the form of branded score boards, school supplies, sports bags, and cups (just to name a few), which is required by exclusive Coke and Pepsi contracts. “

She’s not the only one criticizing the deal.“ While the initial details are promising, PHAI is concerned about some aspects of the agreement as it is being reported,” Daynard said in the press release. “The continual sale of "sports drinks" is a cause for concern. While they have a role for marathon runners and others engaged in sustained strenuous sports, for most students "sports drinks" are just another form of sugar water. Furthermore, the change in beverages offered must be carefully monitored and cannot depend entirely on the schools’ willingness and ability to alter existing contracts. Soda companies have spent decades pushing these unhealthy drinks on children and should bear the responsibility for their removal. PHAI is also concerned about the enforcement of this agreement and its silence on industry marketing activities in the school system,” he said.

"Importantly, the agreement doesn't address the sale of chips, candy, snack cakes, ice cream, or any of the other high-fat, high-calorie, high-salt foods that are sold widely in schools," said Wootan of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, "This is a voluntary agreement and is not enforceable, we need Senator Harkin's school foods bill to lock in the beverage standards and give them the force of law."

Even the diet drinks, which will still be offered, need to go, said Ross Getman, an attorney in Syracuse, NY. Getman has advocated that soda should not be sold in public schools and that long-term "pouring rights" agreements, which give a company exclusive access to sell their brands at a school, are illegal for a variety of reasons.

Getman, who contends that some diet sodas are contaminated with benzene, a cancer-causing chemical, said the soda “industry gets an "F" for incomplete” for “the industry's failure to pull all soda from school and to recall products.”

Schools account for about $700 million in U.S. soft-drink sales, less than 1 percent total revenue for Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Cadbury, the nation's largest soda companies.

Ten of the largest U.S. school districts have already removed soft drinks from vending machines, according to Getman. States including California, Maine and Connecticut have also banned sugary sodas in schools.

<h1>Sex-for-aid spreads in war-torn Liberia</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Sex-for-aid%20spreads%20in%20war-torn%20Liberia&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The aid agency &lt;a href="w%3ASave%20the%20Children"&gt;Save the Children&lt;/a&gt; says an alarming number of girls in &lt;a href="w%3ALiberia"&gt;Liberia&lt;/a&gt;, as young as eight, were having sex with &lt;a href="w%3AUN%20peacekeepers"&gt;UN peacekeepers&lt;/a&gt;, policemen, teachers and humanitarian aid workers in exchange for money, food or favours.

"People don't really accept it but because of the financial constraints, people just have to do so. Most of them are in households headed by only the mother, catering for children. Their fathers got killed in the war, or some fathers are living but can't afford to care for their children; they have to accept the situation, so there is no way out. " 

The report says most people cited lack of economic and livelihood opportunities, as well as chronic poverty, as underlying causes for the ongoing exploitation of children. Parents reported feeling powerless to stop children who were having sex in exchange for goods and services, as they did not have the economic means to provide for their children. In some instances, families cited that transactional sex was a means of supporting the wider family to access things such as food or money to purchase food. In other cases, children identified more personal needs such as clothing or being able to access video clubs to watch films. The widespread nature of the problem meant it affected children in a broad cross section of environments. 

The study, conducted by &lt;a href="w%3ASave%20the%20Children"&gt;Save the Children&lt;/a&gt;, was intended to explore the ways in which children in 'Internally Displaced Person' (IDP) camps are vulnerable to exploitation and abuse as they attempt to meet their basic and other needs. It also explored the roles and responsibilities of humanitarian agencies in providing more protective systems for the delivery of assistance. During the discussions in the field, 315 men, women and children were consulted.

The people of Liberia have experienced ongoing suffering over the past two decades as a result of war and displacement. Children have been drawn into this in many ways, such as recruitment into armed forces, separation from their families, witnessing atrocities, rape and torture. Thousands have been driven from their homes into exile in neighbouring countries or camps for IDPs within Liberia, the report says.

Liberia has been shattered by the 1989-2003 civil war which caused an estimated 250,000 deaths in a country of barely 3 million people. The war forced around 1.3 million people from their homes into camps around the capital &lt;a href="w%3AMonrovia"&gt;Monrovia&lt;/a&gt; or abroad.

Elections late last year saw Harvard-trained former World Bank economist &lt;a href="w%3AEllen%20Johnson-Sirleaf"&gt;Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf&lt;/a&gt; elected as the new president. Her government faces a massive task in rebuilding an economy and society torn apart by years of bloodshed. Many Liberians have been, and continue to be, heavily reliant on humanitarian assistance as a means of survival. Those who are able to find work often still live in chronic poverty with the national average wage being only US$50 per month.

The report found that people unanimously agree that attitudes have fundamentally changed since the war.

“It is like the cultural tradition is not holding any more. People have lost the cultural values and the tradition has been broken down. ” 

Most people said that children were not involved in prostitution before the war, or to a very small extent, and that this only happened in the cities but not in the villages.

For the first time in three decades, direct and at least partially public diplomatic communication will commence between the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States (US)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;. Iranian government spokesman &lt;a href="w%3AGholam-Hossein%20Elham"&gt;Gholam-Hossein Elham&lt;/a&gt; said that Iranian president &lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud%20Ahmadinejad"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt; has sent a letter to the U.S. president &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; proposing "new solutions for getting out of international problems and the current fragile situation of the world". 

Mr Gholam-Hossein Elham did not say whether the letter mentioned the nuclear dispute, one of the diplomatic problems currently straining relations between Iran and the USA. This information arrived one day after the Iranian parliament announced that it might retract from the &lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20Non-Proliferation%20Treaty"&gt;Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)&lt;/a&gt; if Western pressure over its programme was to increase.

Differing reports have been made as to whether or not the letter will be made public, and if so, when. In its online report of 8 May 2006, 09:25 GMT, the &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; quoted Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman &lt;a href="w%3AHamid%20Reza%20Asefi"&gt;Hamid Reza Asefi&lt;/a&gt; as saying that the contents of the letter would be made public once Bush had received it. The updated version of the report of 8 May 2006, 14:52 GMT, quotes Asefi as saying that the contents would be made public "at the right time". An ABC report quoted Gholam-Hossein Elham as saying "it is not an open letter."

Iran's foreign affairs minister, &lt;a href="w%3AManouchehr%20Mottaki"&gt;Manouchehr Mottaki&lt;/a&gt;, delivered the letter to the United States' interests section in the &lt;a href="w%3ASwitzerland"&gt;Swiss&lt;/a&gt; embassy in Tehran on Monday. The United States has not held diplomatic relations with Iran since the &lt;a href="w%3AIran%20hostage%20crisis"&gt;1979 Iranian hostage crisis&lt;/a&gt;.

U.S. Secretary of State &lt;a href="w%3ACondoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; said "this letter isn't it. This letter is not the place that one would find an opening to engage on the nuclear issue or anything of the sort."

"It isn't addressing the issues that we're dealing with in a concrete way," she added.

&lt;a href="John%20R.%20Bolton"&gt;John R. Bolton&lt;/a&gt;, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, also read the letter, saying, "I think it is typical of Iran that when major decisions are about to be taken ... that they have tried to throw sand in the eyes of the proponents of the action. That's what this may be."

The letter has since been put on an official Iranian website, and on Tuesday, Ahmadinejad said "the letter to US President George Bush carries the Iranian nation's views and comments on international issues as well as suggestions for resolving the many problems facing humanity."

&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Air%20Force"&gt;United States Air Force&lt;/a&gt; General &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Hayden"&gt;Michael Hayden&lt;/a&gt; has been nominated as the new director of the &lt;a href="w%3ACIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt;. 

"The men and women of the CIA will have a strong leader to support them," said U.S. President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; in a press conference today.

"This is simply too important to not get absolutely right," said Hayden.

The nomination sparked controversy from Republican and Democratic critics, who claim that the military background of Michael Hayden makes him unsuitable, because the CIA is a civil institution rather than a military arm of the government. &lt;a href="w%3ASaxby%20Chambliss"&gt;Saxby Chambliss&lt;/a&gt; calls it a "major problem" due to the intelligence budget that is already controlled by &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense"&gt;The Pentagon&lt;/a&gt; up to and/or more than 80 percent. &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Hoekstra"&gt;Peter Hoekstra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20Permanent%20Select%20Committee%20on%20Intelligence"&gt;Intelligence Committee&lt;/a&gt; Chairman, says he would oppose the nomination of General Michael Hayden as "the wrong person, the wrong place at the wrong time".

Hayden was head of the &lt;a href="w%3ANSA"&gt;NSA&lt;/a&gt; from 1999-2005 and was in charge of the eavesdropping program that allows the U.S. government to monitor e-mail and international telephone calls of suspected terrorists without obtaining a warrant. Last year, he became the deputy for the director of National Intelligence &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Negroponte"&gt;John Negroponte&lt;/a&gt;.

Hayden also is currently serving more than 35 years in the U.S. Air Force and from 1980-1982 he served as intelligence chief at Osan Air Base which is located in &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;.

On Friday, &lt;a href="w%3APorter%20Goss"&gt;Porter Goss&lt;/a&gt; resigned as director of the agency.

&lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;'s Constitutional Court has ruled that the general election, held on April 2, 2006, is invalid and orders a fresh poll. Thailand is in the middle of political turmoil since the election, which was called by Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AThaksin%20Shinawatra"&gt;Thaksin Shinawatra&lt;/a&gt; in the face of mounting protests.

"The constitutional court voted 8 to 6 that the elections were unconstitutional and voted 9 to 5 to hold a new election," said Judge Ura Wangomklang on Monday.

Earlier, the opposition parties boycotted the April poll. As a result, some of the seats remained empty, which meant parliament could not be formed. Thaksin Shinawatra, the prime minister, was unable to form a new government.

King &lt;a href="w%3ABhumibol%20Adulyadej"&gt;Bhumibol Adulyadej&lt;/a&gt; of Thailand had to intervene to resolve the crisis. He described the situation as a "mess" and said any parliament with no opposition presence would be undemocratic. He initiated the court to pass a ruling to bring back the country to normalcy.

The crisis began when Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra sold 49.6% family stake in telecoms company &lt;a href="w%3AShin%20Corporation"&gt;Shin Corporation&lt;/a&gt; in January. Massive protests were held all over demanding his resignation. He dissolved the parliament in February and called for an emergency election to prove he still had widespread public support. Three main opposition parties decided to boycott the poll.

&lt;a href="w%3AThai%20Rak%20Thai%20Party"&gt;Thai Rak Thai Party&lt;/a&gt; (TRT), led by Thaksin Shinawatra won 57% of the votes in the election held in April amid opposition boycotts. But there were millions of "Reject" votes (That is, voters selecting "None of the above"), which lead to 40 seats being vacant and the Legislature unable to set up a government. Two rounds of by-elections failed to resolve the crisis.

Soon afterwards, under the intervention of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the top judges from Thailand's three main judicial institutions - the Supreme, Administrative and Constitutional courts - met to discuss the situation.

Thailand's ruling Thai Rak Thai Party (TRT) and the former opposition Democrat party pledged on Monday to join the new poll after the court ruling.

The transport union &lt;a href="w%3ARMT"&gt;RMT&lt;/a&gt; has criticised &lt;a href="w%3ATransport%20for%20London"&gt;Transport for London&lt;/a&gt; (TfL) for the decision apparently to privatise the &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20London%20Line"&gt;East London Line&lt;/a&gt;, which is undergoing a major upgrade and extension programme over the coming years. The announcement follows a report from BBC News which claims that a 'leaked memo' has revealed plans for the line to be run by the private sector come 2009. RMT General Secretary said "there is no earthly reason why its operations should not remain within London Underground", adding that the Union would take steps to safeguard the jobs of its members currently working on the line.

Responsibility for the East London Line extension was officially transferred from the &lt;a href="w%3AStrategic%20Rail%20Authority"&gt;Strategic Rail Authority&lt;/a&gt; to Transport for London in November 2004, and London Mayor &lt;a href="w%3AKen%20Livingstone"&gt;Ken Livingstone&lt;/a&gt; has pledged to deliver the £900m extension by the end of the decade. However it has always been the plan that the line, once built, would form part of the national rail network, rather than the Underground network. &lt;a href="w%3ANetwork%20Rail"&gt;Network Rail&lt;/a&gt; will manage much of the track, and private companies will run the trains under strict franchise from the &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Rail"&gt;London Rail&lt;/a&gt; arm of TfL, in the same manner as TfL franchises the bus services.

Phase One of the project, due to be complete in June 2010, will see a northern extension to &lt;a href="w%3ADalston%20Junction"&gt;Dalston Junction&lt;/a&gt; and a southern extension to &lt;a href="w%3ACrystal%20Palace"&gt;Crystal Palace&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Croydon"&gt;West Croydon&lt;/a&gt;. This is in plenty of time for the 2012 London Olympic Games.

Control of the North London Line, currently run by &lt;a href="w%3ASilverlink"&gt;Silverlink&lt;/a&gt;, will also pass to TfL from Autumn 2007. It is planned that eventually the line will join up with the East London Line, the &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20London%20Line"&gt;West London Line&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20London%20Line"&gt;South London Line&lt;/a&gt; to form a circular '&lt;a href="w%3AOrbirail"&gt;Orbirail&lt;/a&gt;' service.

17 year old &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AArsenal%20FC"&gt;Arsenal FC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; striker &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATheo%20Walcott"&gt;Theo Walcott&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is the biggest surprise in England national team coach &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASven-G%C3%B6ran%20Eriksson"&gt;Sven-Göran Eriksson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's preliminary pick for the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFIFA%20World%20Cup%202006"&gt;FIFA World Cup 2006&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in Germany. Injured &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWayne%20Rooney"&gt;Wayne Rooney&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is also one of the players in the squad.

Theo Walcott hasn't yet played a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APremier%20League"&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; game but Eriksson thinks that the team needs players with Walcott's pace. Eriksson decided this morning to pick Walcott ahead of players like &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADarren%20Bent"&gt;Darren Bent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJermain%20Defoe"&gt;Jermain Defoe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . When he named Walcott there were a lot of surprised journalists in the press conference room. "Sometimes you do it on feelings as well and I am excited about Theo Walcott," Eriksson said at the press conference.

He consulted his assistant coach Tord Grip and Arsenal FC coach Arsene Wenger when he picked Walcott. Wenger, who in January convinced the Arsenal FC directors to transfer Walcott from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASouthampton%20F.C."&gt;Southampton FC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , is impressed of what he has seen of him.

Walcott's former mentor, Huw Jennings, agrees with Sven-Göran Eriksson. "He has got tremendous ability and pace, which England are short of," Jennings said in an interview with the &lt;a href="BBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;.

As expected, Wayne Rooney was picked despite his severe injury. Eriksson thinks he should be in the team as the world class player he is. If Rooney isn't expected to be fit enough to play in the tournament he can be replaced, but that has to be done before June 9.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Owen"&gt;Michael Owen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is expected to train with the national team from Monday. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALedley%20King"&gt;Ledley King&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was not picked for the squad due to an injury and hasn't been able to train.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C."&gt;Tottenham Hotspur FC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; coach &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20Jol"&gt;Martin Jol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is amazed that Jermain Defoe is not in the squad but he still believes that he will be there, referring to the situation with Wayne Rooney and Michael Owen. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACharlton%20F.C."&gt;Charlton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; striker Darren Bent says on his agents' website that he is disappointed to be overlooked. 

The final squad must be announced by May 15.

<h2>Headlines</h2>
<h3>&lt;a href="U.S.%20President%20George%20W.%20Bush%20nominates%20Gen.%20Michael%20Hayden%20as%20director%20of%20CIA"&gt;U.S. President George W. Bush nominates Gen. Michael Hayden as director of CIA&lt;/a&gt;</h3>

United States

United States Air Force General Michael Hayden has been nominated as the new director of the CIA.
"The men and woman of the CIA will have a strong leader to support them," said U.S. President George W. Bush in a press conference today.
"This is simply too important to not get absolutely right," said Hayden.
Hayden was head of the NSA from 1999-2005 and was in charge of the eavesdropping program which allows the U.S. government to monitor e-mail and international telephone calls of suspected terrorists without obtaining a warrant. Last year, he became the deputy for the director of National Intelligence John Negroponte.
<h3>&lt;a href="Ahmadinejad%20sends%20open%20letter%20to%20Bush"&gt;Ahmadinejad sends open letter to Bush&lt;/a&gt;</h3>

Iran

It has just been announced that for the first time in three decades, direct, and at least partially public, diplomatic communication will commence between the United States (US) and Iran. Iranian government spokesman Gholam-Hossein Elham said that Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has sent a letter directly to US president George W. Bush proposing "new solutions for getting out of international problems and the current fragile situation of the world".
The Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi said that the contents of the letter would be made public once Bush had received the letter. According to a BBC report timestamped "8 May 2006, 09:25 GMT 10:25", spokespeople for Bush claimed that the letter had not yet been received.
<h3>&lt;a href="Thailand%20election%20was%20invalid%2C%20rules%20court"&gt;Thailand election was invalid, rules court&lt;/a&gt;</h3>

Thailand

Thailand's Constitutional Court has ruled that the general election, held on April 2, 2006, is invalid and orders fresh poll. Thailand is in the middle of political turmoil since the election, which was called by Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra in the face of mounting protests.
"The constitutional court voted 8 to 6 that the elections were unconstitutional and voted 9 to 5 to hold a new election," said Judge Ura Wangomklang on Monday.
Earlier, the opposition parties boycotted the April poll. As a result, some of the seats remained empty, which meant parliament could not be formed. Thaksin Shinawatra, the prime minister, was unable to form a new government.
<h3>&lt;a href="Sex-for-aid%20spreads%20in%20war-torn%20Liberia"&gt;Sex-for-aid spreads in war-torn Liberia&lt;/a&gt;</h3>

Liberia

The aid agency Save the Children says an alarming number of girls in Liberia, as young as eight, were having sex with UN peacekeepers, policemen, teachers and humanitarian aid workers in exchange for money, food or favours.
"People don't really accept it but because of the financial constraints, people just have to do so. Most of them are in households headed by only the mother, catering for children. Their fathers got killed in the war, or some fathers are living but can't afford to care for their children; they have to accept the situation, so there is no way out. "
The report says most people cited lack of economic and livelihood opportunities, as well as chronic poverty, as underlying causes for the ongoing exploitation of children. 
<h3>&lt;a href="Anti-censorship%20developers%20targeting%20China%27s%20%26quot%3BGreat%20Firewall%26quot%3B"&gt;Anti-censorship developers targeting China's "Great Firewall"&lt;/a&gt;</h3>

Canada

Psiphon is being launched the end of this month as a highly anticipated software program that allows Internet users inside China, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Burma, to get around censorship without getting detected by the censors.
Three University of Toronto students, Ron Deibert, Nart Villeneuve, and Michael Hull combined their political passion and love of free expression to create the software program which is attracting attention globally from people like Sharon Hom, executive director of New York-based "Human Rights in China".
<h3>&lt;a href="Rescue%20of%20Tasmanian%20miners%20delayed"&gt;Rescue of Tasmanian miners delayed&lt;/a&gt;</h3>

Australia

Rescuers working to free miners trapped during the Beaconsfield mine collapse have moved to a slightly faster blasting method. The rescue effort was expected to be concluded on Sunday, however due to rescuers encountering extremely hard rock, it has been once again delayed.
<h3>&lt;a href="Union%20criticizes%20East%20London%20Line%20%27privatisation%27"&gt;Union criticizes East London Line 'privatisation'&lt;/a&gt;</h3>

England

The transport union RMT has criticised Transport for London (TfL) for the decision to apparently privatise the East London Line, which is undergoing a major upgrade and extension programme over the coming years. The announcement follows a report from BBC News which claims that a 'leaked memo' has revealed plans for the line to be run by the private sector come 2009. RMT General Secretary said "there is no earthly reason why its operations should not remain within London Underground", adding that the Union would take steps to safeguard the jobs of its members currently working on the line.

<h1>Tasmanian miners rescued</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Tasmanian%20miners%20rescued&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The two miners who had been trapped almost one kilometer beneath the surface in &lt;a href="w%3ABeaconsfield%2C%20Tasmania"&gt;Beaconsfield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Tasmania"&gt;Tasmania&lt;/a&gt; in a collapsed gold mine for 14 days have now been rescued.

The men, Brant Webb and Todd Russell, were well enough to walk out from the lift onto the surface and threw their arms up in exultation. They then walked to a board and removed their location tags to indicate that they were no longer underground at approximately 5:59 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3ATime_in_Australia"&gt;AEST&lt;/a&gt; before embracing family and friends and making their way to the waiting ambulances. The vehicles slowly made their way through the crowds with a police escort and the miners waved to the crowds through the open rear doors. They will undergo medical supervision at &lt;a href="w%3ALaunceston"&gt;Launceston&lt;/a&gt; Hospital for a period of time before being confirmed well enough to return home.

The last stages of the rescue, cutting the final sections of the escape tunnel had proceeded very slowly because very hard rock was encountered and work had to proceed gently to minimize the chances of further rock collapses.

The escape tunnel was completed at 4:47 a.m. AEST and it took another hour for the men to be transported to the surface via a "crib room" at "Level 375" (375 metres underground) where they were medically examined and were also able to shower.

A bell at Beaconsfield's Uniting Church pealed just after 5 a.m. AEST to celebrate the rescue, and an air raid siren was sounded. This was the first time the church bell had been rung since the end of World War II. A local fire engine drove through Beaconsfield's streets sounding the siren to wake residents for the good news.

A funeral will be held later today for a third miner, Larry Knight, who was killed in the collapse that trapped the miners on April 26.

&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Beatles"&gt;The Beatles'&lt;/a&gt; label &lt;a href="w%3AApple%20Corps"&gt;Apple Corps&lt;/a&gt; lost its court case against &lt;a href="w%3AApple%20Computer"&gt;Apple Computer&lt;/a&gt; today in the &lt;a href="w%3AHigh%20Court%20of%20Justice"&gt;High Court&lt;/a&gt;. Apple Corps argued that the iTunes Music Store was a breach of the 1991 settlement reached between the two parties. The 1991 agreement was that Apple Computer would not sell music branded with an apple. Mr Justice Anthony Mann agreed with Apple Computer's defence that, while the iTunes Music Store is branded, the music it sells is not - "I conclude that the use of the Apple logo ... does not suggest a relevant connection with the creative work." During the case Apple Corps showed the court just how many times the Apple Computer logo appeared during a typical download. The song purchased during the demonstration was Le Freak by Chic.

After the case closed Apple Computer CEO &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Jobs"&gt;Steve Jobs&lt;/a&gt; extended an invitation to the record label, "we have always loved the Beatles, and hopefully we can now work together to get them on the iTunes Music Store". Apple Corps have decided to take the case to the &lt;a href="w%3ACourt%20of%20Appeal%20of%20England%20and%20Wales"&gt;Court of Appeal&lt;/a&gt;. Speaking for Apple Corps, manager Neil Aspinall said, "with great respect to the trial judge, we consider he has reached the wrong conclusion."

The main suspect in the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Varanasi%20bombings"&gt;7th March bombings in Varanasi&lt;/a&gt;, was shot dead by Indian security forces in Handwara area of North Kashmir early this morning. Abu Zubair, an operative of the &lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;-based terrorist group Harkat-ul-Jehadi-Islamia was gunned down in a joint operation involving &lt;a href="w%3AJammu%20%26amp%3B%20Kashmir"&gt;Jammu &amp; Kashmir&lt;/a&gt; State Police Special Task Force and the Indian Army.

" On specific information, Zubair was killed in a fierce encounter in Handwara " said Nitish Kumar, a police official, adding the man was considered to have played a leading role in the Varanasi attacks. Kumar said Zubair came from the north Indian state of &lt;a href="w%3AUttar%20Pradesh"&gt;Uttar Pradesh&lt;/a&gt; and was attempting to flee to Pakistan.

The twin blasts in the Sankatmochan temple and the Cantonment Railway station of the temple city of Varanasi on March 7, had left close to 20 dead and nearly 100 injured.

President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W%20Bush"&gt;George W Bush&lt;/a&gt; has announced US emergency food shipments to &lt;a href="w%3ADarfur"&gt;Darfur&lt;/a&gt;, a province of &lt;a href="w%3ASudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt;. He has asked Congress to approve $225m in aid. Sudan and the biggest rebel group signed a peace deal last Friday to end the three year old civil war, claiming more than 200,000 lives. 

&lt;a href="w%3ACondoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt;, US secretary of state will address the UN Security Council to help speed up the deployment of UN peacekeepers to the Darfur region. 

"She's going to request a resolution that will accelerate the deployment of UN peacekeepers into Darfur," President Bush said. "We're now working with the &lt;a href="w%3AUN"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; to identify countries that contribute those troops, so the peacekeeping effort will be robust." 

The Government of Sudan had previously denied UN deployment. But, after the signing of the peace treaty, they have expressed their keenness on the deployment of UN peacekeepers.

<h2>AU lacks fund</h2>

So far, there are around 7,000 &lt;a href="w%3AAfrican%20Union"&gt;African Union&lt;/a&gt; peacekeepers in Darfur, but they have failed to play any significant role to control the violence in the region. They are facing a serious shortage of funds and man-power. It had been two months since any soldier in the peacekeeping forces were paid, &lt;a href="w%3ANigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;n envoy to the African Union confirmed yesterday.

Ambassador Sam Ibok, Nigerian envoy to the AU said, "There have been some cash flow problems, but that has been resolved now and troops will be paid in the next week or so. "

<h2>Chad welcomes treaty</h2>

&lt;a href="w%3AChad"&gt;Chad&lt;/a&gt;, Sudan's neighbouring state, welcomed the signing of the Darfur Peace Agreement between the Sudanese government and the main faction of the rebel &lt;a href="w%3ASudan%20Liberation%20Movement"&gt;Sudan Liberation Movement&lt;/a&gt;. Chad broke off diplomatic relations with Sudan on 14 April, a day after an attack on &lt;a href="w%3AN%E2%80%99Djamena"&gt;N’Djamena&lt;/a&gt; by rebel forces from Sudan. Also, Chad withdrew its delegation from African Union-brokered peace talks for Sudan’s troubled western Darfur region citing Sudanese aggression. Currently, there are more than 200,000 Darfur refugees. 

Foreign minister Ahmat Allami said, "Chad welcomes the signing of the Abuja peace deal on Darfur between the warring Sudanese parties after a long period of negotiations."

&lt;a href="w%3ALibya"&gt;Libya&lt;/a&gt; announced today that it would resume effort to normalize bilateral relations between Chad and Sudan. A Libyan official said a tripartite summit would be held soon.

<h1>Australian Budget for 2006-2007 released</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Australian%20Budget%20for%202006-2007%20released&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The Australian Budget (Appropriation Bill No. 1) for 2006-2007 was released by the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Liberal%20Party"&gt;Australian Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20National%20Party"&gt;Australian National Party&lt;/a&gt; coalition government treasurer, &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Costello"&gt;Peter Costello&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Higgins"&gt;Higgins&lt;/a&gt;, Liberal).

Costello noted the resilience of the economy against natural disasters and terrorism, and through "disciplined and prudent management" the Government was able to "repay Labor's debt" of quoted 96 billion dollars of net debt and the Government was now "debt-free".

Costello noted that the Government budget was in "surplus for the ninth time" with a forecast surplus of 10.8 billion.

<h2>Infrastructure</h2>
Costello announced "new investment in physical infrastructure and research infrastructure". The AusLink program is to receive an additional 2.3 billion, an "increase of nearly 20 percent", and noted that the Budget would allocate "800 million to accelerate duplication of...the Hume Highway", and "270 million dollars to RailTrack" in the development of the north-south rail corridor. 

Costello noted the Government's commitment to the health of the Murray River system by a "new injection of 500 millions to the Murray-Darling basin commission" for a "range of capital works and improvements".

Costello also announced funding for health and medical research, noting an increase in funding for the NHMRC to a base funding of 700 million dollars a year, a "fivefold increase", sixty-five additional fellowships for researchers, and 235 million dollars for "physical infrastructure".

<h2>Tax reform</h2>
Costello announced in regard to tax reform a "new comprehensive tax reform plan" "another installment in income tax reform", a "major improvement in business tax" and a "plan to simplify and streamline superannuation" "most significant change in nearly 20 years"

Costello remarked that if one could reduce the tax burden, one "should aim to do so", and thus announced he would "reduce marginal tax rates" at the other end of income tax scale, and would increase tax-free thresholds. 

On superannuation reform, Costello proposed to "sweep away the current raft of complexity" and "increase retirement incomes". The core of the plan is the "proposal to exempt Australians age 60 or over from any tax" on particular superannuation arrangements.

<h2>Assistance to families</h2>
Costello announced changes in family assistance payments. The Family Tax Benefit payment is now available to those earning under &lt;a href="w%3AAUD"&gt;AUD&lt;/a&gt;$40,000. The limit on the number of subsidised after school hour places would be removed.

Furthermore, Costello noted that "an additional 1000 to be paid this financial year to over 1000 people eligible for the carer payment".

<h2>Defence</h2>
Costello announced that 10.7 billion dollars would be allocated to the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Defence%20Force"&gt;Australian Defence Force&lt;/a&gt;, and announced 2.2 billion would be spent to acquire C-17 heavy lift aircraft.

On intelligence, Costello announced an increase ASIO staffing to 1800 and improvements to its technical capabilities, and a further 125 million to enable increased operations for ASIO.

Costello also said that 389 million dollars would be allocated over four years to combat illegal fishing.

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
Costello concluded by forecasting that Australia's economy would grow to a "trillion dollar economy" and that the Budget would "build opportunities for the future". 

Processing of accompanying bills then begun by Parliament.

The Federal &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Australian Labor Party&lt;/a&gt; Opposition will have a right-of-reply tomorrow.

Today, the day that saw the rescue of trapped miners Brant Webb and Todd Russell in Beaconsfield, &lt;a href="Tasmania"&gt;Tasmania&lt;/a&gt;, their colleague Larry Knight, 44 was farewelled at a funeral service in &lt;a href="w%3ALaunceston%2C%20Tasmania"&gt;Launceston&lt;/a&gt;. Knight was killed when a small &lt;a href="earthquake"&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt; triggered a &lt;a href="w%3ARockfall"&gt;rockfall&lt;/a&gt; killing Knight and trapping Webb and Russell.

Mr. Knight was driving a telehandler which had a small cage attached to its lifting arm that Mr. Webb and Russell were inside when the rockfall occurred. Mr. Knight had been a miner for the past five years.

Mr. Knight's funeral was held at St John's Anglican church in Launceston and was attended by over 700 mourners including Tasmanian &lt;a href="w%3APremier%20of%20Tasmania"&gt;Premier&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Lennon"&gt;Paul Lennon&lt;/a&gt;, Beaconsfield Mine manager Matthew Gill and Todd Russell. It is unknown whether or not Brant Webb attended the service, but it has been reported that he told doctors he intended to.

Mourners were told that Mr. Knight was a laid-back man and fitted the expression "Happy as Larry Well". One of Knight's friends since high school and member of Christian motorcycle club "The God's squad", Chris Brooks, said that Mr. Knight had become more content with life and focused on his children in recent years. Mr. Brooks said that Mr. Knight will be "missed deeply".

Mr. Knight's daughter, Lauren, who lives in &lt;a href="Queensland"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt; read a letter she had written to her father for his birthday three years ago. 

"You're a wonderful, caring, understanding and forgiving father, a long-standing friend, my solid rock and inspiration," she read.

According to Ms. Knight, her father kept the letter in the back of a clock for "safe keeping".

The God's squad played a major role in the funeral service. On the way to the cemetery, they provided an honour guard for the hearse, led by someone on Knight's own Harley Davidson.

Newly appointed British &lt;a href="w%3A%20Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Foreign%20and%20Commonwealth%20Affairs"&gt;Foreign Secretary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMargaret%20Beckett"&gt;Margaret Beckett&lt;/a&gt;, today confirmed that there are no plans for military action in Iran. Beckett has been speaking at a meeting in New York to discuss international policy concerning Iran with her counterparts from France, Germany, Russia, China and the US.

Speaking on BBC Radio she said, "it's not anybody's intention to take the course of military action". Beckett refused, however, to rule out action as 'inconceivable' in the way that her predecessor &lt;a href="w%3AJack%20Straw%20%28politician%29"&gt;Jack Straw&lt;/a&gt; had.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"What people are concerned to do is to get Iran to recognise the strong view and the clear will of the international community that they should comply with the IEAE &lt;nowiki&gt;[International Atomic Energy Agency]&lt;/nowiki&gt; board. You're inviting me to tread down the path of talking about military action - I'm not going to do that. Everybody expresses their views, their stance, in their own way. The way that I choose to express it is that it's not anybody's intention to take the course of military action. That I think is simple and straightforward and clear."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Tony Blair, speaking in a monthly press conference, said that the change of Foreign Secretary would not change policy "one iota".

Hutchison, the company which operates the "3" mobile network in &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; has announced that it's &lt;a href="w%3ACDMA"&gt;2G CDMA&lt;/a&gt; customers will have 90 days to migrate to their &lt;a href="w%3AUMTS"&gt;UMTS&lt;/a&gt; based &lt;a href="w%3A3g"&gt;3G&lt;/a&gt; mobile telephone network or be without service. Hutchison said that customers who were under contract and wished to leave would be able to do so without penalty.

In February, Hutchison rebranded their CDMA service from Orange to 3 CDMA to coincide with its 3G network's company name. Hutchison has been offering their CDMA customers special deals to tempt them into moving to their 3G network and has so far migrated around 200,000 users voluntarily.

It is believed that the migration will cost AU$145 million but will save the company around AU$70 million per year by not having to operate two separate networks.

Kevin Russell, CEO of Hutchison said that customers are looking to get more from their mobile telephone and that customer demand for 3G services is strong. "Customer demand to move to 3G has been very strong," he said. 

"It is clear that customers want more from their mobile service," 

"With a critical mass of our 2G customers now using our 3G service, the time is right to commence plans to close our 2G network" said Mr Russell.

Paul Budde, an independent telecommunications analyst said that some customers might not wish to migrate because of the inferiority of 3G handsets to those used on the CDMA network.

Another hurdle may be that UMTS 3G networks have similar coverage to &lt;a href="w%3AGSM"&gt;GSM&lt;/a&gt; network cells (base stations), which have around 35 km range of coverage. CDMA by comparison has a 90 km range.

Hutchison was the first telecommunications company to launch a 3G network in Australia, however it only operates in &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABrisbane"&gt;Brisbane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGold%20Coast%2C%20Queensland"&gt;The Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAdelaide"&gt;Adelaide&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APerth"&gt;Perth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACanberra"&gt;Canberra&lt;/a&gt;. If users go outside these areas they roam onto &lt;a href="w%3ATelstra"&gt;Telstra's&lt;/a&gt; 2G GSM network.

&lt;a href="w%3ATelstra"&gt;Telstra&lt;/a&gt; has announced plans to build a AU$1 billion 3G network nationwide and will decommission its CDMA service around 2008. At present Telstra has entered into a sharing deal with Hutchison to use the "3" network while its network is rolled out.

&lt;a href="w%3AOptus"&gt;Optus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AVodafone"&gt;Vodafone&lt;/a&gt; have also announced plans to build a 3G network in co-operation with each other nationwide.

The men, Brant Webb and Todd Russell, were well enough to walk out from the lift onto the surface and threw their arms up in exultation. They then walked to a board and removed their location tags to indicate that they were no longer underground at approximately 5:59 a.m. AEST before embracing family and friends and making their way to the waiting ambulances. The vehicles slowly made their way through the crowds with a police escort and the miners waved to the crowds through the open rear doors. They will undergo medical supervision at Launceston Hospital for 24 hours before being confirmed well enough to return home.

Today, the day that saw the rescue of trapped miners (Brant Webb and Todd Russell in Beaconsfield, Tasmania), their collegue Larry Knight, 44 was farewelled at a funeral service in Launceston. Knight was killed when a small earthquake triggered a rockfall killing Knight and trapping Webb and Russell.

<h1>Concrete supplier indicted in Boston 'Big Dig' scandal</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Concrete%20supplier%20indicted%20in%20Boston%20%27Big%20Dig%27%20scandal&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Boston's Central Artery and Third Harbor Tunnel Project (CA/T), unofficially known as the &lt;a href="w%3ABig%20Dig"&gt;Big Dig&lt;/a&gt;, plagued by cost overruns and reports of shoddy workmanship, has been hit with yet another scandal as six employees of its primary concrete supplier have been indicted for falsifying records regarding allegedly inferior concrete supplied to the massive highway construction project.

Federal prosecutors alleged in a 135 count indictment that of the 135,000 truckloads of concrete, a "web" of falsified documents were used to cover up a conspiracy where at least 5,000 truckloads &amp;mdash; 1.2 percent of the concrete used &amp;mdash; did not meet specifications. The company, &lt;a href="w%3AAggregate%20Industries"&gt;Aggregate Industries NE Inc.&lt;/a&gt; was paid US$105 million for the concrete.

Aggregate said in a statement Thursday that it would cooperate with authorities.

"As a result of extensive testing by industry experts, Aggregate Industries is satisfied that all of the concrete it has supplied on the Big Dig and throughout the commonwealth is structurally sound," the statement said.

&lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; Attorney General Tom Reilly said "We have no evidence whatsoever that the structural integrity and safety of the tunnel has been compromised."

Commonwealth of Massachusetts Governor &lt;a href="w%3AMitt%20Romney"&gt;Mitt Romney&lt;/a&gt; said in a prepared statement, "No one in Massachusetts should be surprised to learn that a project so badly mismanaged, over budget, and grossly delayed is now also facing allegations of criminal misbehavior." Romney and Lt. Governor &lt;a href="w%3AKerry%20Healey"&gt;Kerry Healey&lt;/a&gt; have also announced that they have decided to return campaign contributions from workers of Aggregate Industries.

Indicted were: former general manager Robert Prosperi, 63, of &lt;a href="w%3ALynnfield%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Lynnfield, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;; Marc Blais, 36, of &lt;a href="w%3ALynn%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Lynn, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;, a dispatch manager; John Farrar, 42, of &lt;a href="w%3ACanterbury%2C%20Connecticut"&gt;Canterbury, Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;, a dispatch manager; Gerard McNally, 53, of &lt;a href="w%3ARockland%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Rockland, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;, a quality control manager; Gregory Stevenson, 53, of &lt;a href="w%3AFurlong%2C%20Pennsylvania"&gt;Furlong, Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, district operations manager; and Keith Thomas, 50, of &lt;a href="w%3ABillerica%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Billerica, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;, a dispatch manager. Stevenson and Farrar are no longer with the company. Aggregate says it has suspended the others.

According to the indictments, 
<ul>
BULLET::::- the six Aggregate employees recycled concrete that had been rejected because it had not been used within 90 minutes of being mixed
BULLET::::- in some cases double-billing for the loads
BULLET::::- the workers gave falsified documentation to project inspectors to show the concrete was fresh
BULLET::::- the faulty concrete was used in walls and roof slabs in the Interstate 93 tunnel, parts of the Interstate 90 tunnel and the sea walls of the Fort Point Channel, among other places.

</ul>
At the arrest hearing, Assistant U.S. Attorney Fred Wyshack said, "The taxpayers of this community and this country will be paying for years to come." 

Lawyers for the employees say the men believed their conduct was legal, that the concrete supplied by Aggregate Industries met all the strength requirements of the project, and that Big Dig managers sometimes waived the 90-minute rule when trucks of concrete were lined up to meet heavy demand. Stephen Delinsky, an attorney for one of the defendants, said they delivered quality concrete, but prosecutors probing the troubled project are looking to place blame. "It's always easy to blame the lowest level, which is the concrete manufacturers. Each defendant believed that they acted in good faith. They believed at all times their conduct was legal and believed the concrete delivered to the Big Dig was appropriate."

A spokesman for project manager &lt;a href="w%3ABechtel"&gt;Bechtel&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="w%3AParsons%20Brinckerhoff"&gt;Parsons Brinckerhoff&lt;/a&gt; declined comment.

On August 11, 2005, it was announced that the &lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts%20State%20Police"&gt;Massachusetts State Police&lt;/a&gt; searched Aggregate's offices in June and found evidence of faked records that hid the poor quality of concrete delivered for highway project. On March 19, 2006, the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Herald%20Tribune"&gt;International Herald Tribune&lt;/a&gt; reported that Massachusetts "&lt;a href="w%3AAttorney%20General"&gt;Attorney General&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Reilly"&gt;Tom Reilly&lt;/a&gt; plans to sue Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff and other companies if the two sides do not reach an agreement over 200 complaints of poor work in the construction of a highway system under the center of Boston, the &lt;a href="w%3ABoston%20Globe"&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/a&gt; reported Saturday. Reilly was said to be seeking $67 million from Bechtel and $41 million from other companies." 

The purpose of the project was to remove the more than 50-year-old aboveground &lt;a href="w%3AInterstate%2093"&gt;Interstate 93&lt;/a&gt; freeway running through downtown Boston by burying it, and connecting the &lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts%20Turnpike"&gt;Massachusetts Turnpike&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="w%3ALogan%20Airport"&gt;Logan Airport&lt;/a&gt; by running a third tunnel below &lt;a href="w%3ABoston%20Harbor"&gt;Boston Harbor&lt;/a&gt;. The project was completed this year after serious delays and cost overruns reached US$14.6 billion, a more than 500% increase over the original estimate of US$2.6 billion. More than ten years of detours to traffic ended when the last major section opened in January.

<h1>High school seniors take last-chance exit test while judge prepares to strike it down</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=High%20school%20seniors%20take%20last-chance%20exit%20test%20while%20judge%20prepares%20to%20strike%20it%20down&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Fifty &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Logan%20High%20School"&gt;James Logan High School&lt;/a&gt; seniors are scheduled to take the California High School Exit Exam today and tomorrow, while an Oakland judge is preparing to strike down the law requiring would-be high school graduates to pass the high-stakes test.

&lt;a href="w%3AAlameda%20County"&gt;Alameda County&lt;/a&gt; Superior Court Judge Robert Freedman said Monday that he will make his final decision today at 2 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3APacific_Daylight_Time"&gt;PDT&lt;/a&gt; on whether to issue an injunction against the enforcement of the law requiring the exam’s passage, citing “equal protection” concerns.

The ruling would affect about 47,000 &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; high school seniors, and dozens at James Logan High School, who have yet to pass the exam and would be barred from being graduated if they don’t.

Last week, state schools Superintendent Jack O’Connell released new statistics showing that 46.768 seniors, or 10.7 percent of the class of 2006, still haven’t passed the test.

Sixty-one percent of those students are poor, and 44 percent are English learners.

Of the 50 James Logan students taking the test today and tomorrow, 35 speak English as a second language. Eight are special education students. Of the five black students taking the test, four are special education students. Of the three white students taking the test, two are new to the district and the other is a special education student.

One, an Asian immigrant, has a 3.67 grade-point-average.

O’Donnell wrote the law requiring the test when he was in the &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%20Legislature"&gt;state legislature&lt;/a&gt; in 1999.

In a statement to the press, O’Donnell said "Recognizing that today's ruling is not final, I intend to do everything in my power to ensure that at the end of the legal day we maintain the integrity of the high school exit exam," O'Connell said.

&lt;a href="w%3AArnold%20Schwarzenegger"&gt;Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger&lt;/a&gt; said "delaying the exam's implementation does a disservice to our children by depriving us of the best tool we have to make sure schools are performing as they should be."

He said he was “disappointed.”

The attorney who sued the state Feb. 8, Arturo Gonzalez of the San Francisco law firm Morrison &amp; Foerster, "felt strongly that the state should not deprive a student of a diploma unless the state can say that every student has been fairly and properly prepared for that test," he said. "There is overwhelming evidence that students throughout the state have not been taught the material on the test. And many students have been taught by teachers not credentialed in math and English."

The suit, was brought on behalf of lead plaintiff Liliana Valenzuela, a Richmond High senior who maintains a 3.84 grade-point average and is ranked 12th out of 413 in her class. Valenzuela has passed the math portion of the exam, but not the part on English, which she speaks as a second language.

Gonzalez contends the test is unfair, particularly to English learners, because students who have failed the test repeatedly are more likely to attend overcrowded schools with less-qualified teachers.

Judge Freedman said he was persuaded by that argument, but wanted to give the state a chance to change his opinion.

He asked lawyers on both sides to come prepared to talk about how conditions in the schools can be equalized.

Gonzalez urged seniors who still need to pass the test to keep going to classes and studying. "It is absolutely critical for students to understand that even if the order is made final, only those students who passed their classes will get a diploma," he said.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Buncefield%20oil%20depot%20tank%20%27was%20overflowing%27&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A report by the British Health and Safety Executive (HSE) into the &lt;a href="w%3A2005%20Hertfordshire%20Oil%20Storage%20Terminal%20fire"&gt;Buncefield oil depot fire&lt;/a&gt; of December 2005 has suggested that an oil tank at the site was overflowing for 40 minutes before the first explosion took place. A fire soon spread throughout the depot and some of the surrounding area, sending huge plumes of smoke into the air, and the fire took several days to be extinguished.

The HSE report, the third progress report into the disaster, explains with 'reasonable confidence' that Tank 912 in bund A of the site started receiving unleaded motor fuel from 7 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated_Universal_Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt; on December 10, 2005. By 5:20 a.m. the next day, the tank had started to overflow, spilling through air vents at the top of the tank and down the outside. Vapour from the fuel started to form from 5:38 a.m., and by 5:46 a.m. was 2 metres deep, flowing in all directions. The first explosion took place at 6:01 a.m.

Control systems measuring the levels within the tank should have prevented overspilling. A 'servo level gauge' should have sent data back to the control room, but this gave an unchanged reading from 3 a.m., despite the levels continuing to rise. Additionally, a second, float-based safety cut-out should have stopped the inward flow once the 'ultimate high level' was reached, but this too appears to have failed.

It is not known for certain what caused the spark that led to the first explosion. Any evidence is likely to have been destroyed in the fire, and so the exact cause may never be known.

The HSE report did not place any blame, for fear of jeapodising future court cases. Some, including MP for the &lt;a href="w%3AHemel%20Hempstead"&gt;Hemel Hempstead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Penning"&gt;Mike Penning&lt;/a&gt;, have called for a full public inquiry. Many local residents were forced to leave their homes after suffering damage to their houses from the explosion.

The explosion and fire, whilst being one of the biggest health and safety disasters in Britain, did not cause any deaths.

The &lt;a href="UN"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="UN%20General%20Assembly"&gt;General Assembly&lt;/a&gt; elected the &lt;a href="UN"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUN%20Human%20Rights%20council"&gt;Human Rights council&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by secret ballot on May 9, 2006. With the participation of 191 member countries and all votes valid, the assembly elected 44 of the 47-strong membership of the new council, practically putting an end to months of thorny debates. Three seats from Eastern Europe will be elected on Wednesday. Sixty-seven states stood for election.

India emerged as the top vote-getter in Tuesday's elections, winning 173 out of 191 votes in a secret ballot to elect the 47-member Council. It was the biggest tally for any country, surpassing Japan (158) and China (146) in Asia.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABangladesh"&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMalaysia"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJordan"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APhilippines"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABahrain"&gt;Bahrain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASaudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASri%20Lanka"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are included in the Asian Group.

The Western European and Other Groups include &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUK"&gt;Great Britain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASwitzerland"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANetherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFinland"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

All groups were completed but that of Eastern Europe, which only selected three of six seats: &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APoland"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACzech%20Republic"&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Another voting round will be held to elect the remaining three seats 

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; initially opposed this Council and declined to run for a seat citing inadequate correctives. A US State Department spokesperson criticizes the records of new Council members Cuba, China, Russian and Saudi Arabia, hinting that they do not merit being on the Council. US Ambassador &lt;a href="John%20R.%20Bolton"&gt;John R. Bolton&lt;/a&gt; has said the US would work with other member states "to make the council as strong and effective as it can be."

The creation of the Human Rights Council is seen as a key component of overall reform of the United Nations. The new Human Rights Council replaces the 60-year old, largely discredited Human Rights Commission. The Commission was disbanded after a number of countries with dubious human right records manipulated elections to win seats and began to work together as a bloc to defeat resolutions critical against any one of them. 

The new Council will be required to conduct a regular review of the human rights record of all countries beginning with those serving on it. The Council will have its first sitting in Geneva on June 19.

On &lt;a href="w%3AMay%206"&gt;May 6&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3A2006"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALillian%20Asplund"&gt;Lillian Asplund&lt;/a&gt;, the last American survivor of the &lt;a href="w%3ARMS%20Titanic"&gt;Titanic&lt;/a&gt;, died in her home in &lt;a href="w%3AShrewsbury%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Shrewsbury, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;. She was 99 years old.

"She went to sleep peacefully," said vice president of the Nordgren Memorial Chapel Ronald E. Johnson, which is located in &lt;a href="w%3AWorcester%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Worcester, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;.

Barbara Joyce West Dainton and Elizabeth Gladys "Millvina" Dean are the two remaining survivors living in England, however they were too young to have a memory of the Titanic sinking.

"I could see the icebergs for a great distance around. It was cold and the little ones were cuddling close to one another and trying to keep from under the feet of the many excited people … My little girl, Lillie, accompanied me, and my husband said 'Go ahead, we will get into one of the other boats.' He smiled as he said it," said Asplund's mother shortly after arriving in Massachusetts after the disaster. Throughout her life, Ms. Lillian Asplund avoided talking about her survival.

The mother of Asplund, Selma and her three-year-old brother Felix were also on the ship and both survived. Her father and three other brothers were lost at sea. Selma died in 1964 on the 52nd anniversary of the disaster. She was 91 years old. Lilian's brother Felix died on March 1, 1983 at the age of 73.

The Titanic sank on April 15, 1912 when the ship struck an iceberg tearing a hole in the side of the hull. At the time, it was the biggest ship ever built. The Titanic Museum’s collection in Indian Orchard, Massachusetts, was the first permanent exhibition of rare Titanic artifacts and documents donated by survivors.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; have agreed on a "temporary international mechanism" to get aid to the Palestinians for a trial period of three months, to ease financial tensions on the new government led by &lt;a href="w%3AHamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt;.

The Quartet issued a statement after a day of talks in which &lt;a href="w%3AEgypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJordan"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASaudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt; warned of a civil war if the Hamas-led Palestinian Authority was left to collapse.

"The Quartet expressed its willingness to endorse a temporary international mechanism that is limited in scope and duration, operates with full transparency and accountability," it said.

The Palestinian Authority has been facing a financial crisis since US and EU aid was suspended in April. There has been a large effort from the Muslim world, Particularly Egypt to help raise and fund the Pastinians. 

The Palestinian Authority employs some 165,000 people and the UN estimates a quarter of the Palestinian population relies on government salaries. It is estimated that $240 million is needed to cover the PA salaries for March and April.

&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; Associate Minister of Health &lt;a href="w%3ADamien%20O%27Connor"&gt;Damien O'Connor&lt;/a&gt; has proposed that warnings, both images and text, should cover 60% of the packaging of cigarettes sold in the country. New Zealand is required to do so under obligations to the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organisation"&gt;World Health Organisation&lt;/a&gt;.

The new images would depict &lt;a href="w%3Athroat%20cancer"&gt;throat cancer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Agum%20disease"&gt;rotting teeth/gums&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Agangrene"&gt;gangrenous&lt;/a&gt; feet. Ashley Bloomfield, Chief Advisor on Public Health, says written warnings aren't as effective as pictures, and that many smokers do not know most of the diseases that smoking can cause.

If the proposal were adopted, the Ministry would dictate the size and placement of the images to the tobacco companies, but would not subsidise the cost of the changes.

An Australian munitions factory exploded in South Australia. Two people were killed, another two were injured and one is still missing. 

The factory produced explosives for quarrying, civil engineering and the military. 

The explosion leveled everything within 100 metres and could be heard from 70km away. 

Emergency services have been held back to a one kilometre radius of the factory until an explosives expert from Adelaide could come. 

“It's very dangerous, so we're holding back,” police inspector Phil Warwick said, “It's an explosives factory. All right it's exploded, but that doesn't mean all the explosives have gone. There's still smoke coming from the area, which means there must be fire or heat. Put them (remaining explosives and fire) together and we could have another (explosion).”

Pop-singer &lt;a href="w%3ABritney%20Spears"&gt;Britney Spears&lt;/a&gt;, 24, announced last night on the ♡❤Late Show With David Letterman♡❤ that she is pregnant again.

"So, we've established now that you are in fact pregnant, is that right?" asked Letterman.

"Yes, sir," replied Spears. She added, "Don't worry, Dave, it's not yours."

Spears gave birth to her son Sean Preston last September after marrying back-up dancer Kevin Federline, 28, in November 2004. This will be Spears' second child and Federline's fourth.

In 2004, shortly after the birth of her son, Spears put her singing career on hold to raise him. Her last album to be released was her "greatest hits" album in 2004.

In February, a photo of Spears was taken while she was driving her car with her son in her lap. In April, her son allegedly fell from a high chair, hitting his head and prompting Child Welfare agents to go to her home. No charges have been filed in either case.

&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n minister for foreign affairs, Alexander Downer (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Mayo"&gt;Mayo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ), told the &lt;a href="Australian%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;Australian House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday that Australia would provide assistance to &lt;a href="East%20Timor"&gt;East Timor&lt;/a&gt; if the East Timorese government or &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; requested it.

&lt;a href="Northern%20Territory%2C%20Australia"&gt;Northern Territory&lt;/a&gt; member, David Tollner (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Solomon"&gt;Solomon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ,&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACountry%20Liberal%20Party"&gt;Country Liberal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ), who has long had an interest in East Timorese affairs, asked Mr Downer to update the parliament on "recent developments in East Timor".

Riots in East Timor's capital &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADilli"&gt;Dilli&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; killed five people on April 28 following a march supporting 600 East Timorese soldiers who were dismissed for deserting following complaints of discrimination between those from the east and west of East Timor. The Australian government issued a travel advisory for East Timor on May 4, 2006 advising Australians to avoid the country.

Mr Downer today told parliament that there was no indication of violence against foreigners despite the warning still being in place. He continued by saying that the government was "deeply concerned" and would continue to monitor the situation closely. "We have, in a number of ways, strongly urged the leaders of East Timor to resolve quickly and peacefully the differences that there are and, of course, to do so with full regard for the democratic institutions of the country, its constitution, the rule of law and international norms of human rights." said Mr Downer.

Parliament also heard that Australia had agreed with members of the &lt;a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council"&gt;United Nations Security Council&lt;/a&gt; to conduct a new operation in East Timor. "Australia does stand ready to offer assistance if requested by either the East Timor government directly or the United Nations." Mr Downer told parliament.

According to the Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms Agency or &lt;a href="w%3AATF"&gt;ATF&lt;/a&gt;, at least 686 sticks of dynamite and at least 30 pounds of &lt;a href="w%3Aammonium%20nitrate"&gt;ammonium nitrate&lt;/a&gt; were stolen from Gold Mountain Mine Company in &lt;a href="w%3ABig%20Bear%20City%2C%20California"&gt;Big Bear City, California&lt;/a&gt; located in San Bernardino County. Fuel oil and mining equipment are also among the items stolen. When combined, the fuel oil and ammonium nitrate become combustible and authorities fear what could be done with the explosives.

"The obvious concern is someone stole it, and what are they going to do with it? This is a quantity of explosives that could do significant damage. We need to recover these items," said John D'Angelo, spokesman for the ATF.

The thieves cut locks on the gate that leads to the facility and then cut the locks on a metal storage bin and stole its contents and everything inside the facility. The man responsible for mining operations in the area does so as a hobby. The robbery was reported on May 3.

"We urge anyone who has information about this theft to contact ATF and the San Bernardino Sheriff's Department. Our job is to keep the public safe. We take the theft of explosives extremely seriously, and we will relentlessly follow up every lead until we solve the case," said John A. Torres who is the special agent in charge of the ATF in &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%2C%20California"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;.

Authorities have offered a $25,000 reward for information about the crime that leads to an arrest and conviction.

Gary McKinnon was today told that he would be extradited to the US pending appeal. McKinnon stands accused of having caused $700,000 worth of damage to US military computer systems. Describing himself as a "bumbling hacker," McKinnon said his intention was to look for UFOs and information regarding technology that he claims the US government is withholding.

Karen Todner, McKinnon's solicitor, explained that "there is power under the &lt;a href="w%3AComputer%20Misuse%20Act"&gt;Computer Misuse Act&lt;/a&gt; to charge him here and he could stand trial here. In fact, had that happened he probably would have been tried, served his sentence and have been released by now." Speaking after the trial, District Judge Nicholas Evans said, "I readily accept, if convicted in the US, the probable sentence is likely to be appreciably harsher in the US than, in comparable circumstances, it would be in the UK. It must be obvious to any defendant that if you choose to commit a crime in a foreign country, you run the risk of being prosecuted in that country."

Judge Evans reported that the US government has made promises that McKinnon will be tried in a civil court, rather than facing a military hearing. Despite these assurances McKinnon still fears what could happen to him, "as one person has said to me, most people in &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20Bay%20detainment%20camp"&gt;Guantanamo&lt;/a&gt; have not been proved to be terrorists but allegedly I directly attacked the military."

Ms. Todner indicated that they intend to appeal against this initial ruling. "We're proposing to appeal this to the Secretary of State, and if we're still refused we will then appeal to the High Court for a decision to allow Gary to be tried here as a British citizen." This seems unlikely to be successful, however, as Struan Robertson, a computing law expert, explains, "the only way out of it is if he faces the death penalty or if he can prove extradition is politically motivated, which he hasn't done. The fact that he may get 70 years in the US is irrelevant. The treaty makes an exception for capital punishment, but facing a harsh sentence is not in itself grounds to block extradition."

A California judge has delayed until Friday his decision on whether to stop the state from requiring high school students to pass the California High School Exit Examination in order to graduate.

On Monday, &lt;a href="w%3AAlameda%20County"&gt;Alameda County&lt;/a&gt; Superior Court Judge Robert B. Freedman said he would issue an injunction against the high-stakes test, which was taken Tuesday by thousands of seniors in danger of not being graduated unless they pass, unless the state’s attorneys came up with an otherwise convincing argument by 2 p.m.

Instead, Freedman said he would wait until Friday to issue his decision.

The &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; law firm Morrison &amp; Foerster filed the lawsuit on behalf of Richmond High School senior Liliana Valenzuela and others. It contends that the test violates the “equal protection” concept of the law in that poor students and English-language learners don’t have access to equal education.

The ruling would affect about 47,000 California high school seniors, and dozens at &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Logan%20High%20School"&gt;James Logan High School&lt;/a&gt;, who have yet to pass the exam and would be barred from being graduated if they don’t.

Thirty-two James Logan students were scheduled to take the second half of the two-day test Wednesday, along with thousands of others throughout the state.

Last week, state Superintendent of Schools Jack O’Connell said that about 47,000 California high school seniors still needed to pass the test or face the prospect of completing four years of schoolwork without receiving a diploma. O’Connell wrote the law requiring the test while serving in the state legislature.

The statistics O’Donnell cited also show that, while nearly 90 percent of seniors have passed the test, only 71 percent of seniors who are English learners have passed, and 83 percent of those classified as low-income have passed.

Of the 50 taking the first part of the test at Logan High on Tuesday, only 13 were native English speakers.

Cynthia O’Brien, who is coordinating the administration of the exit exam at James Logan, said she’d like some certainty about whether the test is going to be required or not.

“The politicals in STATE and our judicial system need to get together and do the right job by the students. If the Exit Exam is going to go forward, then it needs to go forward. If not, then it needs to be cancelled completely,” she said after a long day of testing Tuesday.

“It is not fair to the students to work their hearts out and agonize over something that has such a large impact on them and then find they didn't need to work so hard. I know there are probably students who have not taken the exam seriously, but the vast majority of Logan students have. They deserve better than to not know from one day to the next what they need to do to be granted a diploma. Most of our students who are taking the exam this go around have given up electives, lunches or time after school to prepare for the test,” she said.

"I am afraid that the message we are giving our students is that you don't need to care,” O’Brien continued, “Then, one day, the system will pull the rope tight, and students will be caught not having what they need. Yes, they should all be doing their best, but when the system cries WOLF too often, people tend to ignore the message.”

O’Donnell, in a statement released on Monday, said he would try to make sure the test counts.

"Recognizing that today’s ruling is not final, I intend to do everything in my power to ensure that at the end of the legal day we maintain the integrity of the high school exit exam, and that all graduates in the class of 2006 will enter college or the workforce with a diploma that reflects their mastery of critical academic skills,” he said.

“Independent research shows that because of the High School Exit Exam, students are working harder and learning more, and those who are struggling are getting the help they need to succeed,” he said.

California &lt;a href="w%3AGovernor%20Arnold%20Schwarzenegger"&gt;Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger&lt;/a&gt; said, "Delaying the exam's implementation does a disservice to our children by depriving us of the best tool we have to make sure schools are performing as they should be. We must increase our efforts to help all students meet the minimal bar set by the exam, not lower our standards or expectations of them.”

"I am disappointed in the Court's tentative ruling to stop implementation of the California High School Exit Exam this year but I remain hopeful this will not be their final word,” he said.

If Freedman grants the injunction, the state’s lawyers say they’ll appeal.

Whatever happens with Valenzuela vs. California, the battle isn’t over. Next week, Freedman is scheduled to hear arguments in another suit that seeks to block the test. Lawyers for Public Advocates claim the department failed to hold until December a public hearing to consider alternatives to the test, six years after the Legislature approved it.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAttorney%20General"&gt;Attorney General&lt;/a&gt; of the United Kingdom, &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Goldsmith%2C%20Baron%20Goldsmith"&gt;Lord Goldsmith&lt;/a&gt;, has called for the closure of the &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20Bay%20detainment%20camp"&gt;Guantanamo Bay detainment camp&lt;/a&gt; at a speech in London today. He said that "the existence of Guantanamo Bay remains unacceptable - it is time, in my view, that it should close." The United States, which operates the naval base, has been under pressure for some time to close the camp, over fears that prisoners have been mistreated and are being held for long periods of time without conviction or trial.

Lord Goldsmith said, "Not only would it, in my personal opinion, be right to close Guantanamo as a matter of principle, I believe it would also help to remove what has become a symbol to many - right or wrong - of injustice. The historic tradition of the United States as a beacon of freedom, liberty and of justice deserves the removal of this symbol."

In the past few days, U.S. President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George Bush&lt;/a&gt; has said he "would very much like to end Guanatanamo," but said he had to wait for a Supreme Court ruling on whether inmates could be tried by military or civilian courts. This ruling is expected in June.

The &lt;a href="w%3AICANN"&gt;Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)&lt;/a&gt; today rejected the creation of a &lt;tt&gt;.XXX&lt;/tt&gt; top-level domain name in a 9-to-5 vote. The &lt;tt&gt;.XXX&lt;/tt&gt; domain would have been created for use by websites that offered pornography. Supporters of the proposal, which would have created a new &lt;a href="w%3ASponsored%20top-level%20domain"&gt;sponsored top-level domain (sTLD)&lt;/a&gt;, say the 'triple X' domain would make it easier to recognise and filter pornographic websites. Opponents suggested that the domain wouldn't be used by all sites, as registration would be voluntary, and that it would legitimise pornography.

Current sponsored top level domains include &lt;a href="w%3A.coop"&gt;.coop&lt;/a&gt;, used by cooperative associations, &lt;a href="w%3A.museum"&gt;.museum&lt;/a&gt; for museums, and &lt;a href="w%3A.travel"&gt;.travel&lt;/a&gt; for travel agents, airlines, and other travel-related sites. &lt;a href="w%3A.post"&gt;.post&lt;/a&gt;, for postal services, is also currently under consideration.

&lt;a href="w%3AMogadishu"&gt;Mogadishu&lt;/a&gt;, capital of &lt;a href="w%3ASomalia"&gt;Somalia&lt;/a&gt;, is witnessing a heavy fighting over the past four days. Almost 100 people have died and 200 have been wounded in the clashes, as health officials said yesterday. The battle between the Islamic Court Union and the Alliance for the Restoration of Peace and Counterterrorism has centered on the northern neighborhood of Sii-Sii. Many of the casualties are civilians caught in the crossfire. There was a temporary truce, but that did not last long.

Islamic militia leader Sheikh Sharif Ahmed called a unilateral truce on Tuesday in response to appeals from those affected by the violence. But his opponents said the truce was called because of a lack of ammunition. The warlords' alliance spokesman Hussein Gutale Rageh said they would only accept the ceasefire if their rivals withdrew from territory they have occupied during the fighting.

The fighting started late on Sunday, when an alliance of warlords attacked the vehicle of a group allied to the Islamic courts, according to eyewitnesses.

This is the second round of the city's most serious fighting in a decade. In March 2006, clashes between the two sides killed at least 90 people. 

The &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; has appealed to both sides to halt the clashes.
UN special representative for Somalia, Francois Lonseny Fall, appealed today for the rival militias to end the hostilities, saying they had created fear and chaos for civilians caught in the crossfire.

" The indiscriminate use of heavy machine guns, mortars, rocket-propelled grenades and artillery in and between urban areas is unacceptable," said Francois Fall. 

Somalia has not had an effective national authority for 15 years after the ousting of longtime dictator President Siad Barre in 1991. 
A UN-backed transitional government has based itself in the central city of &lt;a href="w%3ABaidoa"&gt;Baidoa&lt;/a&gt;, but has so far failed to assert itself elsewhere.

Islamic fundamentalists have portrayed themselves as an alternative capable of bringing order and peace, but they have not hesitated to use force and have allegedly linked up with al-Qaeda terrorists. The Islamic courts have restored order to some parts of the city by providing justice under Sharia - Islamic law. The courts say the warlords alliance is a pawn of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.

Last week, Somalia President &lt;a href="w%3AAbdullahi%20Yusuf"&gt;Abdullahi Yusuf&lt;/a&gt; accused the US of funding the coalition of warlords. The US government says it does support efforts to restore stability to Somalia but refuses to give details on who it backs and how. The alliance of warlords recently created the Alliance for the Restoration of Peace and Counter-Terrorism. It has an anti-terror task force based in nearby &lt;a href="w%3ADjibouti"&gt;Djibouti&lt;/a&gt;. It accuses the Islamic courts of sheltering foreign &lt;a href="w%3AAl-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; leaders.

The ruling Left-Front Party in the Indian state of West Bengal retained power in the state after winning 232 out of 294 State Legislative Assembly seats. This is the seventh consecutive victory for the left front in West Bengal. The chief opposition National Aemocratic Alliance managed to bag only 30 seats while the Congress managed to get only 21 seats.

In Tamil Nadu, the Democratic Progressive Alliance (DPA) led by Dravida Munnetra Kazagham (DMK) has won 162 seats . The DPA have won a clear majority over it's closest rival, an alliance led by the ADMK, which has won only 71 seats out of 234 Assembly seats. The DMK alone doesn't enjoy a simple majority and political negotiations are on to finalize the government structure.

The Left Democratic Front has won 95 out of the 140 seats in the Kerala State Legislative Assembly, beating it's rival the UDF by 42 seats, thereby securing the majority.

In Assam, the Indian National Congress has won 55 seats in the 126 seat Assembly, thereby beating the AGP, which has managed to get 26 seats. Other regional parties have won 45 seats. This implies, however, that the Congress has not achieved the majority required (64 seats out of 126 is the minimum) to form the State Government. The Congress will now have to form a coalition with other parties to get the required number of seats.

The DPA has won 21 out of 30 seats in the Legislative Assembly of the Union Territory of Pondicherry, thereby securing a majority over the ADMK, which managed to get only 6 seats.

Marxists retained &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Bengal"&gt;West Bengal&lt;/a&gt; and regained &lt;a href="w%3AKerala"&gt;Kerala&lt;/a&gt; in assembly elections in 5 Indian states whose results were declared today. &lt;a href="w%3ATamil%20Nadu"&gt;Tamil Nadu&lt;/a&gt; is likely to have its first coalition government headed by DMK's leader &lt;a href="w%3AM%20Karunanidhi"&gt;M Karunanidhi&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AAssam"&gt;Assam&lt;/a&gt; faces a hung assembly, while the Congress-led Front won overwhelmingly in &lt;a href="w%3APondicherry"&gt;Pondicherry&lt;/a&gt;

The &lt;a href="w%3ALeft%20Front"&gt;Left Front&lt;/a&gt;, led by the &lt;a href="w%3ACommunist%20Party%20of%20India%20%28Marxist%29"&gt;Communist Party of India (Marxist)&lt;/a&gt;, won 235 out of the total 294 assembly seats in &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Bengal"&gt;West Bengal&lt;/a&gt;. West Bengal Chief Minister &lt;a href="w%3ABuddhadeb%20Bhattacharya"&gt;Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee&lt;/a&gt; has scored a thumping victory in Jadavpur, winning by a margin of over 58,000 votes. 

"It is our victory. All credit goes to the people," Bhattacharjee told reporters.

Veteran CPI(M) leader and previous Chief Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJyoti%20Basu"&gt;Jyoti Basu&lt;/a&gt; hailed the ruling Left Front's "march to power" in West Bengal for the seventh successive term as "unprecedented in parliamentary history". Basu was Chief Minister of West Bengal from 1977 to 2000.

&lt;a href="w%3ATamil%20Nadu"&gt;Tamil Nadu&lt;/a&gt; is likely to have its first coalition government headed by DMK leader &lt;a href="w%3AM%20Karunanidhi"&gt;M Karunanidhi&lt;/a&gt; after Chief Minister Jayalalithaa is voted out of power. The DMK-led front won in 162 out of 230 assembly seats in Tamil Nadu. And for the fifth time, DMK chief M Karunanidhi is all set to become the chief minister of the state. 

In &lt;a href="w%3AKerala"&gt;Kerala&lt;/a&gt;, The Left Democratic Front was victorious in 98 seats out of 140 constituencies. The UDF, which came to power last time with 99 seats, won only 41 seats.

&lt;a href="w%3AAssam"&gt;Assam&lt;/a&gt; is heading for a hung assembly, whereas in &lt;a href="w%3APondicherry"&gt;Pondicherry&lt;/a&gt;, a Union Territory of India, Indian National Congress-led Front won 20 of 30 seats.

The &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href="Australian%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; heard the traditional right-of-reply to the &lt;a href="Australian%20Budget%20for%202006-2007%20released"&gt;Budget released May 9&lt;/a&gt;, from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Australian Labor Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , led by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKim%20Beazley"&gt;Kim Beazley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Labor, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Brand"&gt;Brand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ), plus Budget replies from minor parties in the &lt;a href="Australian%20Senate"&gt;Australian Senate&lt;/a&gt;.

While the Budget is politically popular, having as one of its main features significant tax reform, Beazley focused on the omissions in the Budget, such as the failure to address a skills shortage.

<h2>Opposition reply</h2>
Beazley opened by stating that "This budget fails middle Australia and mortgages our kids' future", and continued by stating that "after ten long years, they deserve a break" from the Howard Government.

Beazley introduced the key idea of his Budget reply by speaking directly to middle Australia, "Tonight I seek a binding agreement between us… Australia is counting on you to do the next round of heavy lifting… relying on you to drive a new wave of economic prosperity… under a Beazley labor government, when you put in, you get back".

Beazley contrasted that idea by criticising the Treasurer, saying that after five budgets without a decent tax break, which was affected already by "soaring petrol prices", likening him to a poker machine with a payout of only "ten bucks".

Beazley's commented solicited applause from the galleries, and continued sporadically through his reply, which focused on five points:
<ol>
BULLET::::1. new childcare centres at school, giving "parents the incentive to work without killing family life", and announced 200 million dollars for new childcare centres, placed "where childcare shortages mean they're needed most".
BULLET::::2. students shouldn't have to pay for training in trades, and pledged to "get rid of tafe fees for traditional trades", to "train Australians first, train Australians now". Beazley announced payments of "&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAUD"&gt;AUD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; $800 per year for up to four years to apprentices", "&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAUD"&gt;AUD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; $1200 per year for up to two years for childcare workers", and a payment of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAUD"&gt;AUD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; $2000 to students on the completion of their trade.
BULLET::::3. no unfair dismissals. Beazley reiterated his plan to "tear up this government's extreme industrial relations laws" and to put in place a new system "to protect working Australians", "protecting both sides", and "resolving claims"
BULLET::::4. no foreign apprentices: "three hundred thousand Australians have been turned away from tafe" and Beazley would "abolish foreign apprenticeship visas"
BULLET::::5. real broadband: Beazley announced under a Labor government, he would "invest in a joint venture with telecommunications companies to build a super-fast computer network" and bring Australia's networking up to world standards.

</ol>
Beazley also announced the founding of an independent expert body on infrastructure, and a "Building Australia" fund to invest in infrastructure.

In his conclusion, he stated his "unshakable faith in the Australian people", and criticised the Government's failure to "deal with climate change now", the Government's mishandling of foreign debt, rising up to "half a trillion dollars" -- Beazley likened Costello to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWile%20E%20Coyote"&gt;Wile. E. Coyote&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , with an anvil about to drop on his head.

Beazley welcomed the tax cuts, but noted the influence of rising oil prices and student debt. Beazley also noted that he would not have spent the money on the Iraq war and would not have paid money to Saddam's regime, referring to the AWB scandal.

Beazley's speech ended in further applause.

<h2>Minor parties</h2>
<h3>Australian Democrats</h3>
Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALyn%20Allison"&gt;Lyn Allison&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Democrats"&gt;Australian Democrats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt;), the Leader of the Democrats, was the first to speak in the Senate on the Budget.

Allison stated that the Budget was developed through the eyes of "political strategists" and was developed with "little interest in the social, economic, and environmental mess left behind".

Allison criticised the Government, stating that "manufacturing can't compete against cheap imports", criticised size of the trade deficit and foreign debt, noted the lack of the Budget to address high petrol prices, noted that bankruptcies are at their highest, and high household debt, saying that "you won't read about them in this budget".

Allison argued that "surplus should have been invested in the future", to address climate change, student debt which was "burdening generations with personal debt", and strongly criticised the Government in regard to its failure to fund education, saying it was "an act of vandalism".

Allison said that the Budget was a Budget "for buying votes, not for the long-term future of the nation".
Allison continued to describe how the Government had lost its environmental credentials, stating that the "environment in much better hands when the Democrats held the balance of power".

Allison responded to the Budget allowances for transport infrastructure, saying that the Budget "ignoring public transport" and that freeway funding was not sustainable.

Allison argued that the income tax cuts introduced in the Budget were "rewarding those on the highest incomes the most". In response to the mental health provisions in the Budget, she stated that more must be done on mental health, smoking, obesity related disease, and said that the Treasurer's "generosity was not extended to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APharmaceutical%20Benefits%20Scheme"&gt;PBS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ".

She noted how the Government was "cynically failing indigenous Australians", describing a Government scheme of an assistance payment to indigenous Australians which was based on attendance at schools, and that the Government had revised the total amount of payment downward based on the expectations that indigenous Australians will not attend schools.

Ellison concluded by stating that "The Democrats are committed to what we know to be the priorities for a sustainable future for all Australians, well beyond a Costello next decade and most definitely beyond the next election."

<h2>Australian Greens</h2>
Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChristine%20Milne"&gt;Christine Milne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;a href="Tasmania"&gt;Tasmania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Greens"&gt;Australian Greens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) presented the Australian Greens budget reply speech.

She begun by describing how the Howard Government had said they had "delivered rivers of gold and manna from heaven", and that the Budget message was such that "people were prompted to rejoice and be glad to spend, spend, spend".

Milne went on to say that Australia had become "two nations...one that is fixated on the present and cannot see what the problem is and the other that can see the problem and the huge risks for our children, grandchildren and future generations."

Milne noted that the capacity of the environment to provide and fuel economic growth by traditional means "is in doubt". She went on to criticse the squandering of a "a minerals boom which has delivered corporate profits to the Treasury", stating that the money should have been spent on "nation-building".

Milne went on to criticise Australia's interest in nuclear power and criticised Australia's export of uranium, and noted the impact of salinity and climate change, and called for the establishment of a "climate change disaster fund".

Milne responded to the AusLink funding proposed by the Government Budget, by also criticising the lack of development in public transport. Milne also echoed Ellison's criticism of the Government's treatment of its indigenous population, stating "If we cannot address Aboriginal disadvantage in an economic boom time, when can we address it?"

Milne concluded by stating "the Greens’ vision for Australia and the values we hold mean we would not squander the surplus on a spending spree. We do not support the tax cuts or superannuation windfall for high-income earners." and reiterated the points of view that the Greens felt needed addressing.

<h2>Family First</h2>
Stephen Fielding (&lt;a href="South%20Australia"&gt;South Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFamily%20First%20Party"&gt;Family First Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) was the final Senator to speak on the Budget in the Senate. 

He criticised the lack of support for low and middle income earners, stating "The government claims this is a budget for families, but the big winners are the high-income earners", and reiterated his earlier calls for reduction in fuel price by "10c a litre". 

Fielding noted that Family First supported the fact that more families would receive benefits, but called for a greater increase in the benefit rather than "the child-care rebate, which only goes to parents of children attending formal child care".

Fielding concluded by noting that "Families do benefit from this budget and will welcome it. But, for the average Australian family, this budget will not be the bonanza the government would like us all to believe it is."

Mogadishu, capital of Somalia is witnessing a heavy fighting over the past four days. Almost 100 people died so far and 200 wounded in the clashes, as health officials said yesterday.

Many of the casualties are civilians caught in the crossfire. There was a temporary truce, but that did not last long.
Islamic militia leader Sheikh Sharif Ahmed called a unilateral truce on Tuesday in response to appeals from those affected by the violence. But his opponents said the truce was called because of a lack of ammunition. The warlords' alliance spokesman Hussein Gutale Rageh said they would only accept the ceasefire if their rivals withdrew from territory they have occupied during the fighting.

<h1>Giorgio Napolitano elected Italian president</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Giorgio%20Napolitano%20elected%20Italian%20president&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;br style="clear:both;"&gt;

The Italian Parliament in unified session elected &lt;a href="w%3AGiorgio%20Napolitano"&gt;Giorgio Napolitano&lt;/a&gt; the new &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20Italian%20Republic"&gt;President of the Italian Republic&lt;/a&gt; on May 10th.

Napolitano, 80, was elected on the fourth ballot with 543 valid votes (the threshold to win the election was 505). The number of ♡❤great electors♡❤ (the Parliamentarians of both houses and the regional delegates) present was 1,000, of which 990 voted.

The election process started on May 8th, but no winner emerged from the previous three ballots, which required a two-thirds supermajority. Italian parliamentary rules allow a simple majority from the fourth ballot onward.

Other candidates who received more than two votes were Umberto Bossi (42), Massimo D'Alema (10), Giuliano Ferrara (7), Gianni Letta (6), &lt;a href="w%3ASilvio%20Berlusconi"&gt;Silvio Berlusconi&lt;/a&gt; (5), Roberto Dipiazza (3) and Sergio Pininfarina (3). There were 347 blank ballots, along with 14 votes of "null" and 10 vote that went to candidates who only received two votes or fewer.

Italy was in an unusual political situation in which the term of outgoing President &lt;a href="w%3ACarlo%20Azeglio%20Ciampi"&gt;Carlo Azeglio Ciampi&lt;/a&gt; was due to expire as the new center-left government led by Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ARomano%20Prodi"&gt;Romano Prodi&lt;/a&gt; needed to be appointed. Prodi's coalition won the election of April 9-10, defeating the government of Berlusconi. It was not known if the President of the Republic was to be elected first or if the old President was still able to assign the role of Prime Minister. It was decided, after the election of the two Presidents of the Senate and the House of Parliament, to elect the new President of the Republic first.

Ciampi's term expires on May 18, but he has agreed to resign on May 15 before Napolitano's inauguration.

Napolitano is the first person to be elected President of the Republic who previously was a member of the &lt;a href="w%3AItalian%20Communist%20Party"&gt;Italian Communist Party&lt;/a&gt;.

Angry fans of the &lt;a href="w%3AAEK%20Athens"&gt;AEK Athens&lt;/a&gt; football team damaged the ferry "Ierapetra" during the route from &lt;a href="w%3AHeraklio"&gt;Heraklio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACrete"&gt;Crete&lt;/a&gt;, to the port of &lt;a href="w%3ARafina"&gt;Rafina&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AAttica"&gt;Attica&lt;/a&gt;. About 700 AEK supporters boarded the ferry after the end of the &lt;a href="w%3AGreek"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; football cup final between &lt;a href="w%3AOlympiacos"&gt;Olympiacos&lt;/a&gt; and AEK which took place in Crete. The victory of Olympiacos over AEK, 3-0, angered the supporters of AEK, which is believed to be the catalyst for damage in both the stadium and the ship. 

The Prosecutor ordered a preliminary inquiry into the incidents that took place onboard the Ierapetra. During the trip, a group of youths started breaking everything for no apparent reason. They caused extensive damage to the passenger lounges and the bars, while they responded to the crew’s pleas with cursing. A Greek police officer was injured in the leg by a flare, and a crewmember was also injured. 

The owner of the ship, Dane Sea Line of &lt;a href="w%3APiraeus"&gt;Piraeus&lt;/a&gt;, estimates the cost of damage to the ship at €150,000. 

The Greek media has accused the administration of Greek police and the Ministers of Public Order and Shipping of negligence in not doing more to prevent the events.

Some of the nearly 700 sticks of dynamite that were stolen from Gold Mountain Mine Company in Big Bear City, California on May 3, has been returned to a fire department in &lt;a href="w%3ARiverside%2C%20California"&gt;Riverside, California&lt;/a&gt;. An unknown individual placed two plastic tubs of the dynamite in front of the fire department, which prompted streets around the department to be shut down and an elementary school was put on lockdown while the bomb squad examined the package. At least 10 houses near the scene had to be evacuated. The dynamite was then removed without incident.

At about 11:00 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Daylight%20Time"&gt;PDT&lt;/a&gt; today an individual passing by the fire department called &lt;a href="w%3A9-1-1"&gt;9-1-1&lt;/a&gt; to report suspicious packages left in front of the department.

"There's still more missing, and we want the person who left the packages to come forward. Whoever turned this in did the right thing. This person turning in this dynamite [is] a very good sign that perhaps he or she is willing to cooperate," said &lt;a href="w%3AATF"&gt;ATF&lt;/a&gt; spokesman John D'Angelo.

This crime is "a very big deal when you consider the damage one stick of dynamite could cause. In excess of 500 pounds of explosives — that's a large amount," added D'Angelo.

At least 500 pound of explosives and at least 30 pounds of &lt;a href="w%3Aammonium%20nitrate"&gt;ammonium nitrate&lt;/a&gt; are still missing and authorities are still offering a reward of $25,000 for any information leading to an arrest and conviction.

Authorities do not believe the theft is related to terrorism, despite the same materials having been used for these purposes in the past. In 1995, Timothy McVeigh used ammonium nitrate in the attack on the Alfred Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, causing the deaths of 168 people.

<h1>USA Today reports NSA obtained call logs from communications companies</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=USA%20Today%20reports%20NSA%20obtained%20call%20logs%20from%20communications%20companies&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; newspaper ♡❤&lt;a href="USA%20Today"&gt;USA Today&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reported on Thursday that the United States' &lt;a href="National%20Security%20Agency"&gt;National Security Agency&lt;/a&gt; (NSA) collected millions of call logs from telecommunications companies in 2001. The report comes almost four months after a previous NSA controversy involving the monitoring of international calls placed within the United States.

Members of Congress called for answers from the government about the report detailing the agency's collection of records from telecommunications companies of American phone calls.
The top-ranking Democrat on the &lt;a href="w%3ASenate%20Judiciary%20Committee"&gt;Senate Judiciary Committee&lt;/a&gt; said that he was very shocked about the &lt;a href="w%3ANSA"&gt;NSA&lt;/a&gt; revelation. "It is our government, it's not one party's government. It's America's government. Those entrusted with great power have a duty to answer to Americans what they are doing," said Senator &lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Leahy"&gt;Patrick Leahy&lt;/a&gt; of Vermont.

&lt;a href="w%3AAT%26amp%3BT"&gt;AT&amp;T&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AVerizon%20Communications"&gt;Verizon Communications&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ABellSouth"&gt;BellSouth&lt;/a&gt;, three major telecommunications companies in the United States, began releasing logs of millions of phone calls to the NSA shortly after the &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%2C%202001%20attacks"&gt;September 11, 2001 attacks&lt;/a&gt;, according to the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AUSA%20Today"&gt;USA Today&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ report.

Earlier this year, the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Times"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ released a report stating that the &lt;a href="w%3ANSA"&gt;NSA&lt;/a&gt; had been monitoring certain phone calls placed between the United States and other countries. Nominated CIA director &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Hayden"&gt;Michael Hayden&lt;/a&gt; commented on the NSA program on &lt;a href="w%3AJanuary%2023"&gt;January 23&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3A2006"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;, stating: "The purpose of all this is not to collect reams of intelligence, but to detect and prevent attacks." Hayden was the head of the NSA during the programs' durations.

President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; assured Americans that their privacy is being "fiercely protected." "We're not mining or trolling through the personal lives of millions of innocent Americans," commented Bush after leaving for a commencement address at &lt;a href="w%3AMississippi%20Gulf%20Coast%20Community%20College"&gt;Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ABiloxi%2C%20MS"&gt;Biloxi&lt;/a&gt;.

According to the report, the information released by the telecommunications companies does not detail the content of the calls. The identities of those that placed and received the calls were recorded.

The &lt;a href="w%3ASupreme_Court_of_the_United_States"&gt;Supreme Court of the United States&lt;/a&gt; has previously ruled that logs of numbers dialed are not considered 'private' because they are being communicated to the telephone company.

Australia's emergency telephone service, &lt;a href="w%3A000%20emergency"&gt;triple-0&lt;/a&gt;, which is operated by &lt;a href="Telstra"&gt;Telstra&lt;/a&gt;, has been lost in Southern &lt;a href="New%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="Australian%20Capital%20Territory"&gt;Australian Capital Territory&lt;/a&gt; following damage to two optical fibre cables.

It is believed that in two separate incidents, optical fibre cables were cut at Gundagai and Narrandera in Southern NSW. In addition to the loss of the triple-0 service, 34 mobile base stations in the region have also been affected. According to Telstra, local calls are still possible, and they recommend that people dial their local fire, ambulance or police station in case of an emergency.

Telstra says that services will be restored as soon as possible.

Israeli company Dor Energy, the sole supplier of gasoline and cooking gas to the Palestinian territories, cut off all deliveries on Wednesday, citing US$27 million in unpaid bills.

Mujahed Salameh, director general of the Palestinian Petroleum Agency, predicted an "economic catastrophe" which would cripple factories and transportation as many people would be unable to work. 

He said that the Palestinian Authority does not maintain petroleum reserves and that gasoline supplies would run out in many areas by Thursday. The Associated Press reported long lines at gas stations in the Gaza Strip, and gasoline stations through the West Bank have begun rationing.

Dor Energy had threatened supply cutoffs twice before 2006, which were averted when the Palestinians made last-minute payments.

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is reportedly in talks with U.S. and European Union officials in an attempt to get Israel to resume delivery of fuel. For Israel's part, a spokesman for Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said that the Israeli government would "absolutely not" bail out the Palestinians.

The gasoline shortage is expected to deepen an economic and humanitarian crisis in the Palestianian territories since the U.S. and EU cut off aid to the Palestinian Authority after Hamas won parliamentary elections.

♡❤♡Peter Costello’s budget announcement has led to rejoicing for small businesses, but the lack of joy for those pushing for radical corporate taxation reform has led to many businesses asking “what about us?”♡❤♡

Personal taxation and small business have been the big winners after this year’s federal budget. Although dampened by the twin economic threats of rising interest rates and petrol prices, there should be a reasonable amount of real income savings for both low and high income earners, with those receiving Medicare, or a superannuation benefit, privy to an even lower level of taxation (0% for those on super benefits).

Small business also has benefited from the Howard government’s 11th annual budget, with them receiving a higher level of reducing depreciation, leading to a higher level of deductions in the years following the uptake of new technology or other capital. They are also privy to a AU$435 million dollar tax cut to compensate for their changing accounting requirements under the government’s new AIFRS reporting standards, as well as increasing the uptake of both the small business tax relief scheme and CGT (Capital Gains tax) Concessions.

The budget was not a complete loss for big business however, as superannuation laws have been tweaked to streamline contribution and payment rules previously impeding those with multitudes of staff.

But this is not enough, says Big 4 accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young. In their newly published paper “Taxation of Investment in Australia: the need for ongoing reform”. In it they lead the charge for a greater streamlining and organization of the corporate tax system in Australia, submitting that it will lead to reductions in “disincentives to work save and invest in Australia [as well as improving] the international competitiveness of Australian businesses.” This follows from a recent report brought out by Mr. Costello himself about the need for tax reform in Australia.

A budget night Mr. Costello was notably coy about any future reform of corporate tax in Australia. He alluded to the report by his ministers but kept from outlining the government’s plan precisely.

200 people feared dead in an explosion at an oil pipeline near &lt;a href="w%3ALagos"&gt;Lagos&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ANigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;. Many of the bodies had been burnt beyond recognition. Firefighters were on the scene of the explosion at Ilodi; a fishing village 25 miles east of Nigeria's main city of Lagos, and Red Cross workers were helping survivors.

"There was a big fire and quite a number of people died," Red Cross spokeswoman Okon Umoh said. Many of the bodies had fallen into the water of the coastal village. The blast took place when villagers were scooping out fuel that was gushing out from a ruptured pipe.

Nigeria is &lt;a href="w%3AAfrica"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;'s leading oil producer, the world's seventh-biggest exporter and fifth-biggest source of U.S. oil imports. But, most of the population lives in poverty. The pipelines often pass through poor communities, who break them to steal the precious oil. 

Nigeria has a history of pipeline disasters. At least 1000 people died in Jesse in a pipeline blast in October 1998.

The 7/7 train-bombing report just released in the UK suggested that the Internet may have played a role in the bombers' preparations. The bombers used a local bookshop to access extremist websites. They got hold of some of the materials needed to make the bombs online. 

Today search engines say they won't provide details helpful to terrorists. But &lt;a href="w%3AMore4News"&gt;More4News&lt;/a&gt; has been searching Arabic websites to see what kind of jihadi information is still available online

Back in 2003, inspectors had discovered several sites in Iran that tested positive for highly enriched uranium, but the uranium was believed to have come from equipment that was previously from &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;.

On Friday, &lt;a href="Reuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt; published a report quoting &lt;a href="UN"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; diplomats from Vienna who wish to remain anonymous alleging that preliminary analysis of microscopic dust collected from equipment at the now razed &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALavizan-Shiyan"&gt;Lavizan-Shiyan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; research center in &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; in January of 2005, contained traces of "highly enriched &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Auranium"&gt;uranium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ". "It's no smoking gun. There could be many explanations. But it increases pressure on Iran to come clean about Lavizan," Reuters reported the European diplomat as stating.

According to the Islamic Republic News Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, the head of the &lt;a href="IAEA"&gt;IAEA&lt;/a&gt;, said today that the finding of the highly enriched uranium is "of little significance at the current juncture." ElBaradei also pointed out that the investigation into where it came from is continuing and that the uranium could have come from equipment that was imported to Iran, but that "time is still needed to reach a conclusion in this respect."

ElBaradei also highlighted that he is aware of the right for Iran to use nuclear material for "peaceful purposes" and that "a balance between Iran's nuclear rights and concerns of the international community would not be created through verbal disputes, but rather dialogue would be the solution."

Speaking on Friday about the allegation, former UN weapons inspector and former head of the Institute for Science and International Security, David Albright said, "even if it is the same contamination, this is a significant finding because it indicates something was going on at Lavizan. It could be part of Iran's known centrifuge program or a parallel program."

In response, Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hamid Reza Asefi asserted, "these comments lack any importance and do not come from a real source." Denying that his country had carried out any work at the Lavizan-Shiyan facility, Asefi added that the UN claims were "baseless and without importance."

On Friday Iran's President, &lt;a href="Mahmoud%20Ahmadinejad"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt; responded to the UN allegations saying, "they are trying to frighten our country by waging a propaganda campaign using strong words. The people of Iran and the country are not afraid of them" and that "this whole thing is just psychological propaganda, but they know the Islamic republic nation of Iran is a strong nation. I think they have better sense than to have a war with Iran. Every country has the right to defend its right in accordance with the agreed way."

Iran started to enrich uranium at its Natanz nuclear facility April 11, and continues to claim its program is for peaceful purposes.

The islanders of &lt;a href="w%3AChagos%20Archipelago"&gt;Chagos Archipelago&lt;/a&gt; have won a High Court battle that may allow them to return to the islands they were exiled from in 1971. The Chagossians (also known as &lt;a href="w%3AIlois"&gt;Ilois&lt;/a&gt;) had previously won another High Court battle in 2000 which paved the way for their return, but this was overturned by Foreign Secretary Jack Straw using an &lt;a href="w%3AOrder-in-Council"&gt;Order-in-Council&lt;/a&gt;, a little-used piece of legislation involving the Royal Perogative. Yesterday, the high court judges ruled that the use of this action was "irrational and unlawful". The government has 28 days to decide whether to appeal. 

Of about 4,000 exiles from the Chagos islands, most live in poverty within the poor areas of &lt;a href="w%3AMauritius"&gt;Mauritius&lt;/a&gt;. All the exiles have British citizenship, with about 250 living in the UK. The case won in the High Court yesterday was brought by Chagossian community leader Olivier Bancoult, who has been fighting for the right of exiles to return to the islands for many years.

A US military base currently occupies &lt;a href="w%3ADiego%20Garcia"&gt;Diego Garcia&lt;/a&gt;, the biggest island in the group, after having been leased the land by the British government. The base played a role in the Iraq war. Mauritius has claimed ownership of the island, but it is currently considered by the British to be part of the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Indian%20Ocean%20Territory"&gt;British Indian Ocean Territory&lt;/a&gt;. Under the treaty arrangements between the UK and the US, the US is allowed to stop people living on the islands.

It remains to be seen whether, and when, the Ilois will be able to return. Lawyers for the Ilois argued that although they would not initially be able to live in &lt;a href="w%3ADiego%20Garcia"&gt;Diego Garcia&lt;/a&gt;, they should be allowed to return to another of the 52 islands within the group (which contains over 600 islands in total).

A spokesman for the foreign office said: "We are disappointed with the judgement." They have not yet decided whether to appeal.

<h3>&lt;a href="Oil%20Blast%20in%20Nigeria%2C%20200%20feared%20dead"&gt;Oil Blast in Nigeria, 200 feared dead&lt;/a&gt;</h3>

Nigeria

200 people feared dead in an explosion at an oil pipeline near Lagos in Nigeria. Many of the bodies had been burnt beyond recognition. Firefighters were on the scene of the explosion at Ilado, a fishing village 25 miles east of Nigeria's main city of Lagos, and Red Cross workers were helping survivors.
"There was a big fire and quite a number of people died," Red Cross spokeswoman Okon Umoh said. Many of the bodies had fallen into the water of the coastal village. The blast took place when villagers were scooping out fuel that was gushing out from a ruptured pipe.

United Nations

According to the United Nations, preliminary test results show that highly enriched uranium has been found on nuclear equipment in the former Physics Research Center at Lavizan-Shiyan. The results are expected to be confirmed through other lab tests, but diplomats say the uranium is a "very high level of enrichment, close to weapons-grade."
<h3>&lt;a href="Giorgio%20Napolitano%20elected%20Italian%20president"&gt;Giorgio Napolitano elected Italian president&lt;/a&gt;</h3>

Italy

The Italian Parlament in unified session elected Giorgio Napolitano the new President of the Italian Republic on May 10th.
Napolitano, 80, was elected on the fourth ballot with 543 valid votes (the threshold to win the elction was 505). The number of great electors (the Parlamentarians of both houses and the regional delgates) present was 1,000, of which 990 voted.
<h3>&lt;a href="Israeli%20gasoline%20supplier%20to%20Palestinians%20cuts%20supply"&gt;Israeli gasoline supplier to Palestinians cuts supply&lt;/a&gt;</h3>

Israel

Israeli company Dor Energy, the sole supplier of gasoline and cooking gas to the Palestinian territories, cut off all deliveries on Wednesday, citing US$27 million in unpaid bills.
Mujahed Salameh, director general of the Palestinian Petroleum Agency, predicted an "economic catastrophe" which would cripple factories and transportation as many people would be unable to work.
He said that the Palestinian Authority does not maintain petroleum reserves and that gasoline supplies would run out in many areas by Thursday. The Associated Press reported long lines at gas stations in the Gaza Strip, and gasoline stations through the West Bank have begun rationing.

United States

The American newspaper USA Today reported on Thursday that the United States' National Security Agency collected millions of call logs from telecommunication companies in 2001. The report comes almost four months following a previous controversy of the agency, which included the monitoring of International calls placed within the United States.
Congressional members called for answers from the government about the report detailing the agency collecting records of American phone calls from communication companies.

<h3>&lt;a href="Australian%20emergency%20telephone%20service%20lost%20in%20Southern%20NSW%2C%20ACT"&gt;Australian emergency telephone service lost in Southern NSW, ACT&lt;/a&gt;</h3>

Australia

Australia's emergency telephone service, triple-0, which is operated by Telstra has been lost in Southern New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory following damage to two optical fibre cables.
It is believed that in two separate incidents, optical fibre cables were cut at Gundagai and Narrandera in Southern NSW. In addition to the loss of the triple-0 service, 34 mobile base stations in the region have also been affected. According to Telstra local calls are still possible and they recommend that people dial their local fire, ambulance or police station in case of an emergency.

As expected, &lt;a href="w%3AAlameda%20County%2C%20California"&gt;Alameda County&lt;/a&gt; Superior Court Judge Robert Freedman today issued a preliminary injunction stopping the state from requiring would-be high school graduates to pass the California High School Exit Exam, but the state superintendent of schools said he would try to overturn Freedman's ruling.

Just before 2 p.m. PDT, Freedman announced his decision in his &lt;a href="w%3AOakland%2C%20CA"&gt;Oakland&lt;/a&gt; courtroom. 

On Monday, Freedman announced his tentative decision to stop the state from requiring students to pass the test, but withheld his final decision until today to give lawyers in the case time to make further arguments.

In his statement, Freedman said state school officials "are enjoined and restrained from denying any high school senior who is a member of a 2006 graduating class and who is otherwise eligible to graduate and receive a diploma from participating in graduation exercises and receipt of such diploma solely on the ground that such student has not passed all parts" of the exam.

The ruling effects 47,000 seniors statewide, about 11 percent of the class of 2006, who have yet to pass both the English and math sections of the exam.

At &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Logan%20High%20School"&gt;James Logan High School&lt;/a&gt;, about 70 students are effected.

In the case, ♡❤Valenzuela vs. O'Connell♡❤, lawyers for the plaintiffs argued that their clients were denied equal opportunity to pass the test, as they are not offered equal educational opportunities in California schools because of their non-English primary language backgrounds or their low economic status. The students represented face not graduating despite meeting all requirements for graduation except passage of the test, 

Freedman agreed, at least in part. In his decision, he said: "There is evidence in the record that shows that students in economically challenged communities have not had an equal opportunity to learn the materials tested on the (California High School Exit Examination)."

Originally, the case involved 10 students and their families, but since its filing in February, four of the students have passed the test, leaving six students as parties to the case.

"I’m greatly disappointed in today’s court decision to halt the California High School Exit Exam as a graduation requirement for the Class of 2006," said State Superintendent of Schools Jack O'Connell. "This is not only a great disappointment to me, it is a setback for students and hard-fought school accountability in the state of California."

"The preliminary injunction against California’s Exit Exam denies the vast majority of students in the Class of 2006 the opportunity to graduate with diplomas that certify mastery of essential skills in reading and math," he said.

"We will continue to fight the case," said O'Connell, "I have directed our attorneys to immediately appeal this ruling, and to seek a stay of the judge’s order." 

O'Connell wrote the law requiring the test as a state legislator in 1999.

"I applaud Superintendent O'Connell for his decision to appeal the ruling issued today delaying the California High School Exit Exam graduation requirement," said California Governor &lt;a href="w%3AArnold%20Schwarzenegger"&gt;Arnold Schwarzenegger&lt;/a&gt;. "He has my full support in his efforts to secure the exam's implementation this year. I stand behind the exit exam because it is our best resource for ensuring that schools are giving our children the knowledge and the skills they need to begin successful lives."

<h1>Native Hawaiian sovereignty bill to be debated in U.S. Senate in June</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Native%20Hawaiian%20sovereignty%20bill%20to%20be%20debated%20in%20U.S.%20Senate%20in%20June&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Senate"&gt;U.S. Senate&lt;/a&gt; has scheduled debate and a vote in June on a bill that would allegedly initiate a process for &lt;a href="w%3ANative%20Hawaiian"&gt;Native Hawaiian&lt;/a&gt;s to achieve the same level of self-governance and autonomy over their own affairs that many &lt;a href="w%3ANative%20American"&gt;Native American&lt;/a&gt; tribes currently have. Critics of the bill characterize it as going much further than any existing tribal recognition, creating a governing entity based solely on race, without the same requirements as needed for Native American tribal recognition, such as having existed predominantly as a distinct community, having exercised political influence over its members as an autonomous entity, and have continuously been identified as a tribal entity since 1900.

Senator &lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Akaka"&gt;Daniel Akaka&lt;/a&gt; (D-&lt;a href="w%3AHawaii"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;), the main proponent of bill S. 147 (the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act) and a Native Hawaiian himself, had been giving daily speeches on the Senate floor since May 9 in support of the bill to raise awareness of it. His advocacy of the bill has led it to become known as the "&lt;a href="w%3AAkaka%20Bill"&gt;Akaka Bill&lt;/a&gt;." Opponents of the Akaka bill have made &lt;a href="http%3A//wiki.grassrootinstitute.org/mediawiki/index.php%3Ftitle%3DCorrecting_Akaka"&gt;daily responses&lt;/a&gt; to the Senator's speeches as well.

"I thank our majority leader, the senior senator from Tennessee, who is working to uphold his commitment to bring this bill to the Senate floor for a debate and roll call vote," Akaka said after receiving the pledge from Majority Leader &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Frist"&gt;Bill Frist&lt;/a&gt; (R-Tenn.) on Friday. He also recognized his chief opponent, Senator &lt;a href="w%3AJon%20Kyl"&gt;Jon Kyl&lt;/a&gt; (R-Ariz.), who worked with Akaka "to uphold his promise to allow the bill to come to the floor for a debate and roll call vote."

Frist is expected to file a &lt;a href="w%3Acloture"&gt;cloture&lt;/a&gt; motion after the Senate returns from its May recess. A vote on the cloture motion would occur within 48 hours of filing.

Opponents of the bill, including Kyl, charge that the bill is a race-based privilege that the U.S. Constitution prohibits. Others, such as Sen. &lt;a href="w%3ALamar%20Alexander"&gt;Lamar Alexander&lt;/a&gt; (R-Tenn.) imply that passage of the bill could have unintended consequences. In a speech on the Senate floor on Tuesday that preceded Akaka's, Alexander likened the bill to recognizing Hispanic populations descended from pre-republican Texas or giving tribal status to the &lt;a href="w%3AAmish"&gt;Amish&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3AHasidic%20Jew"&gt;Hasidic Jew&lt;/a&gt;s, the ♡❤Honolulu Star-Bulletin♡❤ reported.

Akaka believes that he has bipartisan support for his bill, with four Republican senators pledging support for it. At least six Republican senators would need to vote for the bill for it to pass, assuming that the bill receives solid support from Akaka's fellow Democrats and the chamber's one independent member who usually votes with the Democrats.

A recent report from the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Civil%20Rights%20Commission"&gt;U.S. Civil Rights Commission&lt;/a&gt; recommended that the bill be rejected. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.usccr.gov/pubs/060504NatHawBriefReport.pdf"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APDF"&gt;(PDF)&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;♡❤The Commission recommends against passage of the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2005 (S. 147) as reported out of committee on May 16, 2005, or any other legislation that would discriminate on the basis of race or national origin and further subdivide the American people into discrete subgroups accorded varying degrees of privilege.♡❤&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Civil%20Rights%20Commission"&gt;U.S. Civil Rights Commission&lt;/a&gt; redacted the &lt;a href="http%3A//wiki.grassrootinstitute.org/mediawiki/index.php%3Ftitle%3DUSCCR_Akaka_Findings"&gt;findings section of their draft report&lt;/a&gt; before approving their final report, opponents of the Akaka bill have challenged the characterization of the findings section as being "historically inaccurate" by Akaka bill supporters.

Supporters of the bill, which include the Democratic members of Hawaii's congressional delegation and Republican governor &lt;a href="w%3ALinda%20Lingle"&gt;Linda Lingle&lt;/a&gt;, counter that Hawaii is a unique case because of its former history as an independent nation before the overthrow of the &lt;a href="w%3AKingdom%20of%20Hawaii"&gt;Hawaiian monarchy&lt;/a&gt; in 1893.

Kyl had placed a block on the bill when it was originally placed on the Senate schedule in July 2005, but has since agreed to allow the bill to come to a floor vote. The bill was later deferred indefinitely due in part to &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;n authorities have ordered the compulsory evacuation of thousands of residents living on the slopes of the volcano &lt;a href="w%3AMount%20Merapi%2C%20Central%20Java"&gt;Mount Merapi&lt;/a&gt; in Central Java. The alert level has been raised to the highest level, warning of an imminent eruption of the &lt;a href="w%3Avolcano"&gt;volcano&lt;/a&gt; that has been rumbling for weeks and spewing lava and black ash.

"This morning we raised the status of Merapi to the top alert which is the red code" said Subandrio, head of the Merapi section at the Centre for Volcanological Research and Technology Development.

"Every resident has been ordered to evacuate."

"Because there has been constant lava flows that cause hot gases, we have raised the status to the highest level," said Bambang Dwiyanto, head of the region's vulcanology center.

More than 1,000 people who live closest to the crater, including the elderly and mothers with young children, have already been evacuated. But some residents have remained reluctant to leave; they fear losing property and livestock. 27,000 locals in 3 villages could be affected by this eruption. 

The scientists have warned that the greatest danger could come from hot gasses expelled from the volcano's crater. 

The 3,000m (9,700ft) peak, in densely populated Central Java province, is one of 129 active volcanoes in Indonesia and part of the Pacific "Ring of Fire" - a series of volcanoes stretching from the &lt;a href="w%3AAmericas"&gt;Americas&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; and Southeast Asia.
It has small eruptions every 3-4 years and larger eruptions every 10-15 years. It has produced more &lt;a href="w%3Apyroclastic%20flows"&gt;pyroclastic flows&lt;/a&gt;, popularly known as heat cloud and magma, than any other volcano in the world. A gas cloud from the volcano's last eruption in 1994 killed 60 people. During the eruption in 1930, 1,300 people died. Historians say that Mount Merapi has been active for 10,000 years. The locals consider Mount Merapi very sacred. According to the local folklore the volcano's eruption is the result of spirits being angered by not receiving sufficient offerings or by a disrespectful attitude among the people on the slopes.

<h3>&lt;a href="Merapi%20roars%2C%20compulsory%20evacuation%20ordered"&gt;Merapi roars, compulsory evacuation ordered&lt;/a&gt;</h3>

Indonesia

Indonesian authorities have ordered the compulsory evacuation of thousands of residents living on the slopes of the volcano Mount Merapi. The alert level has been raised to the highest level, warning of an imminent eruption of the volcano which has been rumbling for weeks and spewing lavas and black ash.
<h3>&lt;a href="Full%20text%20of%20Ahmadinejad%27s%20letter%20to%20Bush%20made%20available%20online"&gt;Full text of Ahmadinejad's letter to Bush made available online&lt;/a&gt;</h3>

France

The French daily Le Monde, which has a tradition of publishing full texts by politicians and intellectuals, was one of the first organisations to publish the full English text of Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's letter to US president George W. Bush, on May 9, 2006. On the same day, the US daily the Wall Street Journal published a scan of the English text and the Iranian Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) published the full text. In the UK, the Guardian published the full text two days later.
<h3>&lt;a href="Native%20Hawaiian%20sovereignty%20bill%20to%20be%20debated%20in%20U.S.%20Senate%20in%20June"&gt;Native Hawaiian sovereignty bill to be debated in U.S. Senate in June&lt;/a&gt;</h3>

United States

The U.S. Senate has scheduled debate and a vote in June on a bill that would initiate a process for Native Hawaiians to achieve the same level of self-governance and autonomy over their own affairs that many Native American tribes currently have.
Senator Daniel Akaka (D-Hawaii), the main proponent of bill S. 147 (the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act) and a Native Hawaiian himself, had been giving daily speeches on the Senate floor in support of the bill since May 9 to raise awareness of the bill. So connected is Akaka to the bill that the bill has become known as the "Akaka Bill."

<h1>Liverpool win an exciting FA Cup final</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Liverpool%20win%20an%20exciting%20FA%20Cup%20final&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3ALiverpool%20F.C."&gt;Liverpool Football Club&lt;/a&gt; won the 2006 &lt;a href="w%3AFA%20Cup"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt; 3-1 on penalties after an eventful final against &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Ham%20United%20F.C."&gt;West Ham United&lt;/a&gt; ending 3-3 after extra time. Whilst the first twenty minutes started slowly, the pace couldn't have been any faster during the rest of the ninety minutes of normal play. West Ham took an early lead from a &lt;a href="w%3AJamie%20Carragher"&gt;Jamie Carragher&lt;/a&gt; own goal 21 minutes into the game, before scoring another through &lt;a href="w%3ADean%20Ashton"&gt;Dean Ashton&lt;/a&gt; seven minutes later. Two goals down, Liverpool scored with a goal from &lt;a href="w%3ADjibril%20Cisse"&gt;Djibril Cisse&lt;/a&gt; just four minutes later and then drew level in the second half with an impressive volley from &lt;a href="w%3ASteven%20Gerrard"&gt;Steven Gerrard&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Konchesky"&gt;Paul Konchesky&lt;/a&gt; put West Ham back in front on the 54th minute with a left wing cross that somehow ended up in the back of the net. 

With West Ham 3-2 up, play continued at a frantic pace with plenty of opportunities for both teams, but the Hammers looked set to hold out till the final whistle. As the clock hit 90 minutes though, Gerrard, despite suffering from cramp, saved Liverpool from defeat with a last minute goal.

Going into extra time, both teams were suffering from the fast tempo of the first 90 minutes, with several injured and cramp-suffering players on both teams. With both sides having used up their three substitutions however, they had no choice but to battle on, and compared to the rest of the match, play slowed down considerably. West Ham nearly snatched victory with a shot from &lt;a href="w%3ANigel%20Reo-Coker"&gt;Nigel Reo-Coker&lt;/a&gt;, but Liverpool keeper &lt;a href="w%3APepe%20Reina"&gt;Pepe Reina&lt;/a&gt; managed a deflection, and with the ball landing at the injured foot of West Ham's &lt;a href="w%3AMarlon%20Harewood"&gt;Marlon Harewood&lt;/a&gt;, it was all he could do to get a shot in, which went badly wide.

As extra time finished, the game turned to the penalty shootout to decide the cup winners. 40 year old &lt;a href="w%3ATeddy%20Sheringham"&gt;Teddy Sheringham&lt;/a&gt; scored one for West Ham, but with three of West Ham's penalties getting saved by the keeper, Liverpool won 3-1, missing just one penalty themselves.

West Ham were firm underdogs in this final, but the teams proved to be a good match for each other, and pundits agreed that this was the best FA cup final for several decades.

<h1>Fitzgerald to announce new evidence against Libby</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Fitzgerald%20to%20announce%20new%20evidence%20against%20Libby&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Federal prosecutor &lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Fitzgerald"&gt;Patrick Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt; announced on Friday that he would introduce new evidence in the &lt;a href="w%3Aperjury"&gt;perjury&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aobstruction%20of%20justice"&gt;obstruction of justice&lt;/a&gt; case against former Vice Presidential chief of staff &lt;a href="w%3ALewis%20%26quot%3BScooter%26quot%3B%20Libby"&gt;Lewis "Scooter" Libby&lt;/a&gt;.
One of the new pieces of evidence consists of handwritten notes that Vice President &lt;a href="Dick%20Cheney"&gt;Dick Cheney&lt;/a&gt; left on the margins of ambassador &lt;a href="w%3AJoseph%20C.%20Wilson"&gt;Joseph Wilson&lt;/a&gt;'s OpEd column questioning the administration's handling of evidence regarding weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in the run-up to the Iraq war. Fitzgerald charged that "those annotations support the proposition that publication of the Wilson Op Ed acutely focused the attention of the Vice President and the defendant - his chief of staff - on Mr. Wilson, on the assertions made in his article, and on responding to those assertions." Fitzgerald describes the notes as reflecting "the contemporaneous reaction of the Vice President to Mr. Wilson's Op Ed article" and views the relevance of these notes as "establishing some of the facts that were viewed as important by the defendant's immediate superior." 

In the margins of Wilson's article Cheney wrote a series of questions about the legitimacy of Wilson's &lt;a href="w%3ACIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt;-sponsored trip to &lt;a href="w%3ANiger"&gt;Niger&lt;/a&gt;: "Have they done this sort of thing before? Send an Amb. [sic] to answer a question? Do we ordinarily send people out pro bono to work for us? Or did his wife send him on a junket?"

Lea Ann McBride, spokesperson for the Vice President, declined to comment on the publishing of the notes, but stressed that the Office of the Vice President continues to cooperate with the investigation.

&lt;br style="clear:both;"&gt;

The &lt;a href="w%3ABulls%20%28rugby%20club%29"&gt;Bulls&lt;/a&gt; rugby team has managed to reach the semi-finals of the Southern Hemisphere provincial &lt;a href="w%3Arugby%20union"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; competition, the &lt;a href="w%3ASuper%2014"&gt;Super 14&lt;/a&gt;. Despite entering the match with the burden of having to score 32 points and receiving a bonus point (by scoring four &lt;a href="w%3Atry"&gt;tries&lt;/a&gt;). The Bulls managed to overcome fellow &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;n team, the &lt;a href="w%3AStormers"&gt;Stormers&lt;/a&gt;, at Newlands Stadium in &lt;a href="w%3ACape%20Town"&gt;Cape Town&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday May 13, winning the match 43 points to 10 in the final round of the regular season.

Entering the final round of the regular season, the Bulls and fellow South African Durban-based &lt;a href="w%3ASharks%20%28rugby%20club%29"&gt;Sharks&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the Australian Canberra-based &lt;a href="w%3AACT%20Brumbies"&gt;Brumbies&lt;/a&gt; were the only sides in contention for the fourth and last finals position. After the Brumbies, who unlike the Sharks were actually ahead on the number of points, were soundly defeated by the Canterbury-based &lt;a href="w%3ACanterbury%20Crusaders"&gt;Crusaders&lt;/a&gt;, 33 points to 3, the result meant that either the Sharks or Bulls could mathematically take fourth position on the ladder. The Sharks stormed to victory over Perth-based Western Force, winning 41 points to 25, meaning that the Bulls would have to score at least four tries to be ensured of a bonus point, to move ahead of the Sharks, who were now sitting in front of them on points difference.

Despite the set back of both prop Danie Thiart and captain &lt;a href="w%3AVictor%20Matfield"&gt;Victor Matfield&lt;/a&gt; to the sin-bin in the first half, the Pretoria-based Bulls entered halftime leading 26 points to 3. A try to the Stormers happened in the opening minute of the second half, though the Bulls held on to the victory. &lt;a href="w%3ABryan%20Habana"&gt;Bryan Habana&lt;/a&gt; scored the last try, which was subsequently converted and pushed the Bulls into fourth place on the table on points difference. The Bulls will now faced the Crusaders in New Zealand next week for a spot in the final, the other spot is to be contested also in New Zealand, between the Wellington-based &lt;a href="w%3AWellington%20Hurricanes"&gt;Hurricanes&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales%20Waratahs"&gt;New South Wales Waratahs&lt;/a&gt;.

SKY TV had problems earlier with some viewers unable to tune into certain channels.

It was caused by a streamlining issue not related to satellite problems.

The problem caused the following channels unable to be seen: Sky Movies, J2, Cartoon Network, Sky News, pay-per-view movie channels, radio channels including; National Radio, Concert FM and George FM.
Most of the free-to-air channels, however, were working, along with the sport channels, some channels did suffer from picture pixelation.

In a statement released on Thursday, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Committee%20of%20the%20Red%20Cross"&gt;International Committee of the Red Cross&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (ICRC) said that ICRC President Jacob Kellenberger "deplored the fact that the U.S. authorities had not moved closer to granting the ICRC access to persons held in undisclosed locations."

The ICRC started making requests to get access to all &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; detainees, including the ones held in alleged secret prisons, over two years ago. After Kellenberger met with senior officials, including Secretary of State &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACondoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Defense Secretary &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADonald%20Rumsfeld"&gt;Donald Rumsfeld&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and National Security Adviser &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Hadley"&gt;Stephen Hadley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , he was again refused access to terrorist suspects held in secret detention centers, chief ICRC spokesperson Antonella Notari said on Friday.

Kellenberger said that "No matter how legitimate the grounds for detention, there exists no right to conceal a person's whereabouts or to deny that he or she is being detained".

In response, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20State%20Department"&gt;U.S. State Department&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; spokesman Sean McCormack said that the ICRC has access to the vast majority of U.S. detainees, but said that "There is a certain subcategory of individuals who have forfeited their protections under the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeneva%20Conventions"&gt;Geneva Conventions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and there is not an obligation to allow access to those individuals."

Lead programmer of &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20Word"&gt;Microsoft Word&lt;/a&gt;, Joe Friend, wrote on his blog that the upcoming version of Microsoft Word (which will be a part of Microsoft Office 2007 suite) will have &lt;a href="w%3Ablog"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; editing and publishing functions.

Friend said: ♡❤"When I write a blog post using my blog providers web-based editor I miss some of the familiar Word features that I've come to rely on, specifically background spelling (those little red squiggles) and autocorrect. These features keep me from making stupid mistakes."♡❤

Friend also said that Word 2007 will not generate unnecessary &lt;a href="w%3AHTML"&gt;HTML&lt;/a&gt; code. ♡❤"Bold become &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, Italic becomes &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, Heading 1 become &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, Quotes become &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; and on it goes."♡❤

Previously, critics of Microsoft Word's HTML generation capabilities held that the application generated unneeded and bulky HTML code.

Graphic files that users would use in blog entries will be converted to the &lt;a href="w%3APNG"&gt;PNG&lt;/a&gt; format, which includes support for alpha channel (i.e. partial) transparency.

In a move designed to both clarify existing copyright law, and extend existing provisions to digital media users, the Australian Attorney-General has announced a proposed update of copyright law.

The new law, described as "commonsense amendments", will clarify provisions allowing individuals to legally record programs and transfer recordings between media such as CD and MP3 for private use, whilst at the same time ensuring that unauthorised copying and usage remains illegal. 

These provisions have broadly existed to date and in previous analogue media, but over the past few years have been eroded by stricter laws and licensing agreements, and by measures intended to prevent piracy, which have made it harder for legitimate users to undertake actions they see as part of reasonable ownership rights, such as backups and private use of purchased materials.

A riot took place at the main prison in Haiti on Sunday. The prison is located within a few miles of the Parliament building.

According to the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, at least 100 prisoners stormed the roof of the prison and were seen holding what appeared to be 2 dead inmates. Prisoners were also heard chanting "freedom or death" and held a banner saying "Justice."

Haitian police and United Nations Peacekeepers arrived on scene shortly after the riot erupted and surrounded the prison.

The riot occurred just hours before the inauguration of Haitian President &lt;a href="w%3ARen%C3%A9%20Pr%C3%A9val"&gt;René Préval&lt;/a&gt;. Préval, who previously served as Prime Minister in 1991 and as President from 1996 to 2001, had no official statement about the riot, which occurred just a half-mile from the parliament building from which Préval was inaugurated Sunday.

&lt;a href="w%3AFernando%20Alonso"&gt;Fernando Alonso&lt;/a&gt; became the first Spaniard to win the &lt;a href="w%3AFIA"&gt;FIA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFormula-1"&gt;Formula-1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Spanish%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;Spanish Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike in the previous race, this time, &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Schumacher"&gt;Michael Schumacher&lt;/a&gt; placed third after the qualification on Saturday. &lt;a href="w%3AGiancarlo%20Fisichella"&gt;Giancarlo Fisicella&lt;/a&gt;, Alonso's teammate, started second, thus completing the front row by Renault. Two Ferrari cars occupied the second row.

In the race, which took place in &lt;a href="w%3ABarcelona"&gt;Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMontmello"&gt;Montmello&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACircuit%20de%20Catalunya"&gt;circuit de Catalunya&lt;/a&gt;, Schumacher struck hard to overtake Renault drivers, but finished with this goal half done. Unable to compete with Alonso's speed, he easily overtook Fisico after the first pit stop.

As said by the winner about his own speed, he "controlled the second part of the race" and slowed down because of the huge gap between him and his closest competitor, Michael Schumacher.

Although he set the fastest lap in the race, this time, &lt;a href="w%3AFelipe%20Massa"&gt;Felipe Massa&lt;/a&gt; did not have enough pace to overtake Fisicella, thus completing the race on the fourth place. &lt;a href="w%3AKimi%20R%C3%A4ikk%C3%B6nen"&gt;Kimi Räikkönen&lt;/a&gt; did not struggle as much with the other drivers as he did with his own car and finished fifth. All the other competitors, except for the sixth place &lt;a href="w%3AJenson%20Button"&gt;Jenson Button&lt;/a&gt;, finished with a gap more than a lap.

In the drivers' championship, Fernando Alonso won back 2 points from Michael Schumacher and now has a 15-point lead.

PCC (♡❤&lt;a href="w%3APrimeiro%20Comando%20da%20Capital"&gt;Primeiro Comando da Capital&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, Portuguese for First Command of the Capital City) criminals have been backing several attacks against security forces in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. Since Friday, there have been 81 deaths: 22 military and 6 civil policemen, 8 prison personnel, 3 city guards and 4 civilians have been targeted. 180 attacks against personnel, police departments, busses and banks have been recorded.
In the meantime, there have been 53 prison riots across São Paulo, Mato Grosso do Sul and Paraná, with hostages. There is no confirmed count of wounded and dead, but early information indicates that rival faction members have killed criminals during the riots.

This has been a response to the government's decision last week to isolate the leaders of the group. Criminals have also set fire to more than forty buses and banks, but there haven't been any confirmed victims.

As a response to these incidents, the State Police of São Paulo have arrested 82 suspects. They have closed streets near police departments, and armed policemen are patrolling regions of the city.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; senator &lt;a href="w%3ABarnaby%20Joyce"&gt;Barnaby Joyce&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;Nationals&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AQueensland"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt;) has moved to oppose the government's planned changes to the country's petrol retail industry. The National Party, of which Senator Joyce is a member, governs Australia in coalition with the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20party%20of%20Australia"&gt;Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt;.

The government plans to amend regulations governing the petrol industry to allow oil companies to own more than five percent of petrol stations. Senator Joyce has given notice to disallow regulations that would force the government to debate them in the House of Representatives and the Senate.

Senator Joyce said the proposed changes would hurt the smaller retailers in the industry. "What we need is protection for independents and mum and dad businesses," he told the Australian Financial Review.

Senator Joyce is concerned that the proposed regulations would start takeovers of smaller retailers by oil companies. "Obviously the sites they're going to get are the sites that are controlled by independents or independent franchisees, what I would term the mum and dad operators," he said.

"In 1980 we thought it was a good thing for there to be wider participation in the retail market by mum and dad operators and I still think that's a just cause," said Senator Joyce.

It is not the first time Senator Joyce has gone against his party's legislation. Senator Joyce refused to support a government bill changing Australia's trade practices law in October 2005 and voted against voluntary student unionism legislation in December 2005.

Senator Helen Coonan, &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; minister for communication, information technology and the arts, has announced the federal government will be extending its subsidy on satellite telephone handsets.

The scheme allows those living or working in parts of remote Australia without conventional mobile telephone services to claim a subsidy of up to AU$1,200 on the purchase of a satellite telephone.

The program was supposed to run for five years from 2002 until 2007. The program will continue until 2009.

In addition to the extension, the scheme's eligibility criteria will be changed from July 1, 2006 to ensure that the scheme "continues to be well targeted," according to Senator Coonan.

The changes will allow aboriginal corporations and educational institutions to claim the subsidy, which were previously ineligible. “These changes include increasing the level of support available to Indigenous corporations who may now be able to receive more than two subsidies in some circumstances, and introducing educational institutions as an eligible category,” Senator Coonan said.

The government will also change the way the subsidy is calculated. In the past, it had been calculated based upon the call plan chosen by the customer. The government will now calculate the subsidy based on the amount of time the customer spends in remote areas. Those operating a business in areas without ground-based mobile telephone services will be eligible for the full AU$1,200 subsidy, while those who spend some time in such areas will be eligible for AU$900.

&lt;br style="clear:both;"&gt;

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n Mitchell Dean won the &lt;a href="w%3AHonolulu%20Triathlon"&gt;Honolulu Triathlon&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday, defeating American Manuel Huerta by five seconds to win the event in 1 hour, 46 minutes, and 55 seconds.

Huerta came in second at 1 hour and 47 minutes flat, and Haven Barnes finished third at 1 hour, 47 minutes, and 6 seconds.

In the women's race, Jasmine Oeinck of Littleton, Colorado won in 1 hour, 56 minutes, and 21 seconds. Sarah Groff finished second in 1 hour, 57 minutes, and 18 seconds; and Sara McLarty finished third in 1 hour, 58 minutes, and 8 seconds.

Dean and Oeinck both earned US$3,000 for their victories.

About 900 triathletes entered the event, which includes a 1.5 km swim at Ala Moana Beach Park just west of Waikiki, a 40 km out-and-back bicycle leg along Nimitz Highway to &lt;a href="w%3AAloha%20Stadium"&gt;Aloha Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, and a 10 km run around Ala Moana Beach Park and Kewalo Basin. About 250 fewer athletes entered this year, a drop attributed to local triathletes concerned about water quality after the recent sewage spill in nearby Ala Wai Canal.

This year's course was changed from last year's amid complaints from East Honolulu residents frustrated with the number of sporting events scheduled in the area, including the &lt;a href="w%3AHonolulu%20Marathon"&gt;Honolulu Marathon&lt;/a&gt;.

The Honolulu Triathlon hosted the 2004 U.S. Olympic triathlon trials, and was the only International Triathlon Union World Cup event in the United States in 2005. It is one of four such qualifying events in the U.S. this year.

The trial of &lt;a href="w%3ASaddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt; resumed Monday in Baghdad where the former &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraqi&lt;/a&gt; President is now officially charged with murder, with torturing women and children, and with razing farmland and authorizing the illegal arrests of 399 people in the 1980's.

Hussein refused to answer the charges, and when Judge Abdel-Rahman asked Hussein if he pleaded "guilty or not guilty", Hussain simply replied, "this is no way to treat the president of Iraq." Rahman then entered a plea of "not guilty" for the former President.

"I can’t just say yes or no to this. You read all this for the sake of public consumption, and I can’t answer it in brief. This statement cannot influence me or shake a hair of my head," said Hussein.

"You are before Saddam Hussein, president of Iraq. I am the president of Iraq according to the will of the Iraqis and I am still the president up to this moment," he added.

"After allegations of coming under an assassination attempt, you issued orders to security forces and the army to arrest residents and use all weapons against them. As a result of your orders to use force against Dujail residents, nine people were killed in the first two days ... and 399 others were arrested," said Rahman.

Hussein's half brother Barzan Ibrahim who was head of the Mukhabarat intelligence agency, was called in shortly after Saddam rejected to enter a plea. Ibrahim was also charged with the same offenses including the murder of 148 Dujail Shiites in 1982, who were sentenced to death for an assassination attempt on the former Iraqi President. Most died while under interrogation or were put to death.

"All you said are lies, everything you mentioned is a lie," said Ibrahim.

In the Iraqi court system, plaintiffs are the first to present their case on the complaint and present evidence against the defendants. When the charges are read, it means it's time for the defense team to present their case.

Seven other former members of Hussein's government are also on trial, facing the same charges. The trial began October 19, 2005.

A spectacular fiesta took place in Karaiskaki Stadium in &lt;a href="w%3APiraeus%2C%20Greece"&gt;Piraeus, Greece&lt;/a&gt;, when 30,000 supporters of &lt;a href="w%3AOlympiacos"&gt;Olympiacos F.C.&lt;/a&gt;, along with players and team administration, celebrated their 34th &lt;a href="w%3AAlpha%20Ethniki"&gt;Alpha Ethniki&lt;/a&gt; title. Guest of honour was the retired &lt;a href="w%3AArgentinian"&gt;Argentinian&lt;/a&gt; superstar &lt;a href="w%3ADiego%20Maradona"&gt;Diego Armando Maradona&lt;/a&gt;, who personally delivered the Cup of the Champion to the players of Olympiacos and went on stage, in the centre of the stadium, and shouted "Viva Grecia, viva Olympiacos!". 

Diego Maradona had also the opportunity to deliver a short skills demonstration with Olympiacos' Brazilian superstar, &lt;a href="w%3ARivaldo"&gt;Rivaldo&lt;/a&gt;, on the Karaiskaki pitch - something which caused delirium within the fans' ranks. Olympiacos' season ended with a 0-0 draw against Ionikos, but this result was irrelevant, as the club was already secure, at the top of the Greek Championship table. This season, Olympiacos have accomplished the double in Greek football, winning both the Championship and the Cup competition.

As a result of its league position, Olympiakos will play in the &lt;a href="w%3AChampions%20League"&gt;Champions League&lt;/a&gt; next season, entering at the group stage.

Genevieve Rachel Nielsen, 31, who was kidnapped when she was 21 months old from her home in &lt;a href="w%3AOakland%20County%2C%20Michigan"&gt;Oakland County, Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, has been found living under another name in &lt;a href="w%3AArizona"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday, Mother's Day.

In 1976, Eric Douglas Nielsen, the ex-husband of Laura Gooder of &lt;a href="w%3APontiac%2C%20Michigan"&gt;Pontiac, Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, took Gooder's daughter to his home for a visit and never returned her.

"It's bittersweet. [Gooder] has complete joy and relief that her daughter is alive, but it is a painful reminder of the 30 years she was without her daughter on Mother's Day. The daughter believed her mother had been killed in a car accident a long time ago. She obviously was told something completely different from the father," said Michael Bouchard, an Oakland County Sheriff who was in charge of the investigation. After authority interviews, they contacted the daughter to tell her that her mother was indeed alive, remarried, was residing in Michigan and was a mother to 3 boys.

"The daughter is just reeling. She was shocked. ... Her whole life is a house of cards built on lies," added Bouchard.

A tip led Bouchard and federal marshals to an Arizona prison where Eric Nielsen was allegedly being held for 7 years under assault charges.

"He was due to get out at the end of the month, so that put some urgency on us," said Bouchard.

So far, according to Bouchard, the mother and daughter have not yet made contact. "They're both just trying to come to grips with it."

"It is pretty surreal. I am keeping my fingers crossed and waiting for her to call," said Gooder.

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; has announced full diplomatic relations will be restored with &lt;a href="Libya"&gt;Libya&lt;/a&gt; and the country removed from the list of nations the U.S. considers to be state sponsors of terrorism following a 45-day open comment period.

Renewal of diplomatic relations between the two states comes after extended diplomatic efforts by both parties to end the 25-year break.

"It is a result of mutual interests, agreements and understandings," said Abdurrahman Shalgham, Libyan's Foreign Minister.

"We are taking these actions in recognition of Libya's continued commitment to its renunciation of terrorism and the excellent cooperation Libya has provided to the United States and other members of the international community in response to common global threats faced by the civilized world since September 11, 2001," said &lt;a href="Condoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State"&gt;United States Secretary of State&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Diplomatic ties were strained between the countries following the rise to power of Libyan leader &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMuammar%20al-Gaddafi"&gt;Muammar al-Gaddafi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 1969, and U.S. economic sanctions against the country beginning in the 1970s. They were severed following the U.S. removal of diplomatic personnel from Libya in 1979 after a mob set fire to the U.S. embassy in Tripoli, and the U.S. closing the Libyan embassy and expelling Libyan diplomats in 1981.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; removed international economic sanctions in 1999, following Libya's acceptance of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Security%20Council%20Resolution"&gt;UN Security Council Resolutions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; regarding &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APan%20Am%20Flight%20103"&gt;Pan Am Flight 103&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . In 2003 Libya announced efforts to dismantle military programs to develop weapons of mass destruction as well, which led directly to diplomatic negotiations with the U.S. and the opening of a diplomatic liaison office in Tripoli in 2004.

<h1>Mass evictions from Oakland's public housing</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Mass%20evictions%20from%20Oakland%27s%20public%20housing&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
Due to an Oakland housing official's acts of fraud, 34 poor families face eviction from Lockwood Gardens, by order of the Oakland Housing Authority. 

Fear and panic have set in at some of East Oakland's public housing units, as police agents from the Oakland Housing Authority have been making late-night visits to tenants, and demanding that the families pack up and move within a five-day period. 

After refusing to pack up and run, more than 30 families are facing mass eviction by the Oakland Housing Authority (OHA) from their public housing units at Lockwood Gardens, a Hope VI Project on 65th Avenue in East Oakland. 

The OHA is claiming that at least 34 families currently facing eviction from Lockwood Gardens are unlawful occupants (squatters) who have illegally gained possession of the housing units. OHA officials have served them 30-day, forcible-detainer eviction notices in an effort to remove them. 

On April 28, the first three cases out of 34 families facing eviction were headed for Alameda County Superior Court, but the court hearings have been delayed repeatedly as Judge Winifred Smith moves to consolidate all the cases.

In defense of some of the evictees, Oakland's Eviction Defense Center has teamed up with attorney Bob Salinas, of Sundeen Salinas &amp; Pyle, to file a demurrer seeking dismissal of evictions on behalf of the first three families that were served forcible-detainer
eviction notices. Lockwood Gardens has 372 units; and it is part of a revitalization project of East Oakland's public housing properties, and a partial recipient of $26,510,020 in grant funding from the Hope Vl program administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

The revitalization funds were divided between three public housing projects in 1994 and 1996, and renovations have since taken place to demolish and rebuild the three locations into modern housing units in Oakland's eastside neighborhoods. 

Laura Lane, an attorney with the East Bay Community Law Center, is also representing a number of the families facing eviction at Lockwood Gardens and those cases will head to court at a later date. 

Currently, out of the 34 families facing eviction, the Eviction Defense Center (EDC) is representing nine families in court, and the East Bay Community Law Center (EBCLC) is representing 12 families. One family has already been frightened into moving away from
their public housing unit by the OHA; no one seems to know if the remaining seven families facing eviction have moved away or are seeking legal representation elsewhere. 

Jennifer Bell of Goldfarb and Lipman is the General Counsel for the Oakland Housing Authority, and is leading the charge in court to evict the 34 families from their housing units in East Oakland.

During an April 24th interview with David Lipsetz, a Senior Policy Analyst with the Oakland Housing Authority, he blamed the tenants for what is occurring and accused all the families of committing fraud to move into public housing. At first, 29 families faced
eviction, although that number has slowly risen to 34 as new families are served with eviction notices. 

"The OHA has served eviction notices to 29 families at Lockwood Gardens because none of the families applied for, or got onto the waiting list to move into their public housing units," said Lipsetc. "The tenants worked with a former clerk to gain access to the
units. The OHA does not have any files on the families, and the OHA does not believe that any of the families signed a lease before moving into those units. Forcible detainers are standard procedure for those that have illegally moved into the OHA's public housing units."

Lipsetz said that the OHA just recently discovered that the 29 families who are now living in those housing units did not match the names of the clients on the OHA list waiting to move into those units. 

"As far as we can tell," said Lipsetz, "there were no signed leases, no files established for these families, no security deposits have been paid before moving in, and those families got ahead of all the other families on the waiting list to move in."

Contrary to what Lipsetz stated on behalf of the Oakland Housing Authority, the facts reveal that the families have all signed Leases, Tenant Agreements To Maintain A Drug-Free Environment, Occupant's Responsibility statements, Lease Compliance forms and
a host of other documents before moving in otheir public housing units. Those documents were all counter-signed by a host of clerks and managers working for the OHA. The soon-to-be-evicted tenants' Billing Summaries, Tenant Leases and Notices have a host of names on them, such as Kim Boyd, an OHA Supervisor; Donald McShane, an OHA Manager; and Alice Ferguson, another OHA Manager. 

In addition, as important as it may be that low-income tenants should not jump in line ahead of one another to move into this much-needed subsidized housing, most housing authorities across the nation recently have said the hell with their waiting lists, and allowed Hurricane Katrina's victims to jump in ahead of all of those already waiting in line for housing.

A web page called "HUD's Public Housing Program" has a section titled "WHEN WILL I BE NOTIFIED?" HUD's website states: "If the HA determines that you are eligible, your name will be put on a waiting list, unless the HA is able to assist you immediately." The
web page may be found at http://www.hud.gov/renting/phprog.cfm

After discovering that the families facing eviction did indeed sign leases and other documents before moving into Lockwood Gardens, suddenly no one at the OHA would go on record to comment about the signed documents that contradicted the accusations of OHA spokesman David Lipsetz.

The documents clearly reveal that the 34 families facing eviction at Lockwood Gardens have all beenchecked out, and qualified as being eligible to move into those units, regardless of what the OHA may say at this point.

The entire controversy appears to have been triggered by acts of deception and fraud on the part of an official of the Oakland Housing Authority, Carolyn Wilson. "The police have been looking for Carolyn Wilson of the Oakland Housing Authority ever since she
disappeared recently," said Ms. Kelly, a resident of Lockwood Gardens who prefers to use only her last name for this story. 

"I moved into Lockwood Gardens on October 27, and Carolyn Wilson's name is on my lease," said Kelly. "I first received a message from the OHA at my mother's home, telling me that a unit was available at Lockwood Gardens, and I went to their office location on 65th
Avenue to fill out the necessary forms to move in. I supplied birth certificates, photo IDs, Social Security numbers, income statements and everything else asked of me to qualify for moving in. There's no way that I committed fraud by following through with
everything being asked of me by the Housing Authority."

Kelley said she and her young child were disturbed by an unexpected, late-night arrival of OHA police at her door.

"I am a 41-year-old woman with an 11-year-old child, and I am very frightened by the way the OHA has been treating me," she said. "I was terrified recently when the OHA Police showed up at my door around 10 p.m. at night, accusing my family of committing fraud to move into this townhouse; and they served me a five-day notice to surrender my home to the OHA, or else."

Officer Jerold Coates, a 13-year employee of the OHA Police Department, and Officer Malcolm Williams are involved in the investigation taking place at Lockwood Gardens. According to Ms. Kelly, "Officer Coates told me that Carolyn Wilson was demanding that everyone must pay her $500 to $1,000 to move in, and he wanted to know how much I paid her before moving in. I denied paying
Ms. Wilson anything extra to move into Lockwood Gardens." 

Kelly added, "From what I am being told by others is that Carolyn Wilson of the OHA skipped town with everyone's security deposits of $500 to $1,000 for each family involved in the scam, and that the OHA will not receive a subsidy from HUD for the families
facing eviction in those units, because the OHA believes that the wrong families are residing in those housing units."

One of the families that moved into Lockwood Gardens, and is now facing eviction, moved away from another public housing location in Oakland in order to move into the Hope Vl project on 65th Avenue. It takes permission to move from one location to another in public housing, and managers or staff at the OHA had to give their blessings before this family was allowed to relocate to Lockwood Gardens. 

Jorge Aguilar, an attorney for the Eviction Defense Center, has his own understanding of what is going on. "An agent of the Oakland Housing Authority defrauded nearly 30 families of the most vulnerable segment of the community," he said. "They are now trying to cover their wrongful act by evicting those families. The OHA is trying to circumvent Measure EE [Oakland's Just Cause for eviction measure]. The irony is that the OHA is using forcible detainers to evict, which have traditionally been used to defend tenants from
landlords using self-help evictions."

Aguilar recently witnessed the human suffering already caused by the OHA's eviction threats and rough handling of the families involved. He said, "During a recent interview with one of the families facing eviction, a little boy started crying and stated that
the police came by and tried to take my bedroom away from me."

Another Lockwood Gardens tenant named Winou Wakeyo said, "I'm from Jimma, Ethiopa, and I moved into Lockwood Gardens on November 22, 2005. I work 12 hours a day on Sundays for a pastor who told me to come here to find housing, and I did everything the Housing
Authority asked of me before moving in. A big policeman came by recently late at night with a five-day notice telling me that I must surrender my home to the Housing Authority. There were two policemen. It scared me very much, and someone later told me to find a defender to save my housing, and I contacted the Eviction Defense Center for help.

"I do not understand the customs of this country, and I asked my defender what I did wrong, and I was told that someone stole some money. The Housing Authority stopped accepting my rent for April, and about two weeks ago, they suddenly sent back the rent that I
paid for March, and I do not understand why they are doing this to me." 

Laura Lane, an attorney for the EBCLC, said, "The Oakland Housing Authority seems to be in a complete disarray. The management has failed to adequately screen, train or supervise its employees. But when the employees make mistakes or fail to follow the law, the
Oakland Housing Authority's response is to blame the tenants, blame the attorneys, blame the federal government -- blame anyone but the Oakland Housing Authority. There is an utter failure to accept personal responsibility."

After it became apparent that many families were seeking legal help to fight the evictions, a meeting was held on March 20 at the East Bay Community Law Center for the victims of the housing scam. When the tenants started sharing what had occurred to them,
most of the families involved suddenly realized that Carolyn Wilson of the OHA had stolen their security deposits, and skipped out of town. 

Tenants at Lockwood Gardens believe that there may be another 40 families or more to face eviction, since they learned that OHA police are also investigating other public housing properties in Oakland that may be caught up in the housing scam. 

As recently as April 22, OHA police were back at Lockwood Gardens pounding on the tenants' doors, and demanding to know if the families have moved yet. 

"This time the police were not satisfied to know if my family had moved yet," said Kelly, "but they wanted to know if any of us noticed any other families moving out of here lately. Considering the way they have been treating us, I don't think we have to tell them anything at this point, and they need to talk to my attorney if they have any further questions."

Honolulu police on Saturday fatally shot a man who reportedly fired a shotgun at them on a residential street in rural Oahu.

Police received a call at about 6:30 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3AHawaii-Aleutian_Standard_Time_Zone"&gt;HST&lt;/a&gt; that a man in a black trench coat had fired a shotgun at a parked car on Kaukama Road in Ma'ili, on the west coast of Oahu. The Specialized Services Division of the Honolulu Police Department was called to the scene.

When officers ordered him to get out of the car, the gunman fired a shotgun at the officers, then pointed two handguns at an officer, who fired at the gunman, hitting him in the head. The man was pronounced dead at the scene.

The officer involved has been placed on administrative leave, as per standard HPD procedure after a fatal shooting.

The gunman was later identified as Tracy Peters, 47, who had a long criminal history with 23 criminal convictions, including drug possession, firearms violations, and second-degree robbery. 

Peters had reportedly been experiencing family problems, and had warned acquaintances that he was going to do something drastic. "The next time you see me, I'm going to be in a casket," he said.

&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; Police have charged a 29 year old Sydney man for driving whilst disqualified twice within three hours on Sunday. Police claim that the man had been disqualified until 2012.

Police allege that they caught the man driving a Nissan Skyline whilst disqualified. He was subsequently charged and granted bail to appear in the Downing Centre Local Court on June 5.

Following being charged at Redfern police station, Police allege that when the man was released at 3:30 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3ATime_in_Australia"&gt;AEST&lt;/a&gt; he walked back to his Nissan Skyline and drove away. Police spotted him again in Newtown, pulled him over where he was taken back to Redfern police station and charged.

At Redfern police station, the man was refused bail and was kept in custody until Monday.

After a trawler sank in heavy seas on Saturday, in the &lt;a href="w%3AFoveaux%20Strait"&gt;Foveaux Strait&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, on the way back from . Of the nine people on board, including three generations of one family, only three survived. 

Police believe the boat sank in less than a minute. 

During the previous ten years, another six incidents occurred in the Strait, costing eight lives.

Maritime New Zealand investigators arrived in &lt;a href="w%3ABluff"&gt;Bluff&lt;/a&gt; yesterday to begin an inquiry into the cause of the tragedy.

The Indian government has once again delayed the testing of the medium-range Agni-III missile. The state-run Defence Research and Development Organisation had planned to conduct trials later this month. The Agni-III, which has a range of 3000 kilometres and the ability to carry nuclear warheads, is intended to boost India's nuclear-deterrence capabilities to a great extent. The DRDO also has plans for developing an Inter-Continental Ballistic Missile for the same purpose.

Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh said that the nation had more pressing issues, such as poverty to deal with, and could not afford to divert huge funds to the test-launch programme.

The D.R.D.O, which has often been criticized for its failure to meet deadlines, indicated its disappointment at the government statement. At a public function for the inauguration of the new D.R.D.O headquarters at New Delhi, Chief Controller S.C Narang pointedly said that his team was prepared to launch Agni-III within the week. Experts have stated that unless India displays its nuclear capabilities more seriously, its nuclear-deterrence capabilities will not seem credible.

News articles frequently discuss some issues but neglect others that might be more critical. Today the UN issued its &lt;a href="http%3A//www.un.org/events/tenstories/story.asp%3FstoryID%3D3300"&gt;third annual list&lt;/a&gt; to focus attention on a set of these relatively ignored stories. There is no particular order to the list, summarized here:

<ol>
BULLET::::1. Rebuilding &lt;a href="w%3ALiberia"&gt;Liberia&lt;/a&gt;: The nation used to be more stable and productive than its neighbors, but was destroyed by civil war.
BULLET::::2. Restricting asylum: International asylum seekers recently suffer increasing difficulty as developed nations reduce economic migration.

BULLET::::7. After the Pakistan earthquake: Quick relief efforts saved many survivors from disease or hunger.
BULLET::::8. Imprisoned children: Children are often jailed for minor causes.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20England"&gt;New England&lt;/a&gt; region of the United States has received the heaviest rainfall in decades leading to flooding and massive road closures. The states affected are &lt;a href="w%3AMaine"&gt;Maine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Hampshire"&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href="w%3Astate%20of%20emergency"&gt;state of emergency&lt;/a&gt; has been declared in all these areas. The floods have also led to thousands of evacuations in many cities. Only a single death has been reported.

The main concern in many cities and towns is whether the dams that hold rivers from flowing in cities will hold long enough.

These floods are the worst in New England since 1936 when over 150 died. 
<h2>Maine</h2>
In Maine, many roads and bridges were damaged or submerged as residents were evacuated from their homes in Lebanon because of two dams near breaking point.

<h2>Massachusetts</h2>
In Haverhill, Mass. sewage pipes broke spilling 115 million gallons of sewage into the city a day. Over 1000 people have had to evacuate their homes In Lowell because of the flooding.

In Peabody, Mass. the downtown area is currently flooded.

<h2>New Hampshire</h2>
Over 600 roads were damaged or completely submerged by the floods in many areas of the state. The hardest hit cities have been Manchester and Newmarket who are both leading in the most amount of evacuations. The flood waters have also weakened and destroyed many dams.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; told journalists in &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20DC"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; that Australia had no plans to take back spent &lt;a href="w%3AUranium"&gt;Uranium&lt;/a&gt;, despite the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; pushing for such a system.

On Monday, Mr Howard held talks with US Energy Secretary Sam Bodman who has indicated that the US would like to see a system where countries lease nuclear fuel instead of buying it. Once the fuel had been used, it would be returned to the country where it originated.

Mr Howard accused the media of misunderstanding Australia's role in the Uranium industry. He told reporters that Australia is simply a Uranium supplier and that it does not convert Uranium into nuclear fuel. Mr Howard believes that the US plan is to create a group of Uranium processing nations that will take radioactive waste once it has been used.

"The question of waste disposal of course is an issue for those who process uranium and develop nuclear fuel, rather than the supplier of the uranium - which if Australia were to remain as a bare exporter would be the situation obtaining in relation to us" said Mr Howard.

According to Mr Howard, the purpose of the plan is to stop the proliferation of countries that have the capacity to process nuclear fuel. 

Mr Howard said that Australia would continue to sell Uranium to other parts of the world, subject to its own safeguards. For a country to purchase Uranium from Australia they must enter into a nuclear safeguards agreement, prohibiting Australian Uranium from being used in weapons and must be a signatory to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;UN's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20Non-Proliferation%20Treaty"&gt;Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty&lt;/a&gt;. Mr Howard claims that it is still more attractive for Australia to sell Uranium rather than leasing it.

Mr Howard told reporters that he asked the US to keep him informed on the proposal but does not expect Australia to be involved in the development of the proposal.

A man spoke of his embarrassment and shock after he was mistakenly rushed into the &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20News"&gt;BBC News&lt;/a&gt; 24 studio and interviewed live on the news channel about the &lt;a href="w%3AApple%20Corps"&gt;Apple Corps&lt;/a&gt; (Beatles) vs. &lt;a href="w%3AApple%20Inc."&gt;Apple Inc.&lt;/a&gt; court case. 
The producer called for the real guest, ICT expert Guy Kewney, but Guy Goma, waiting in a wrong reception area of &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20Television%20Centre"&gt;BBC Television Centre&lt;/a&gt;, mistakenly heard and identified himself as Kewney. He was taken into the studio and as the presenter asked the first question, the bemused look on his face was clear to see. However, the reporter charged on anyway, embarrassing Congo-born Goma with a further two questions which he struggled through.

BellSouth, said in a statement yesterday that the telecommunications company did not hand over customer call records to the &lt;a href="National%20Security%20Agency"&gt;National Security Agency&lt;/a&gt; or NSA. On May 11, 2006, ♡❤&lt;a href="USA%20Today"&gt;USA Today&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reported that the NSA collected millions of call logs from telecommunications companies in 2001 under a contract the NSA claims to have had with the company.

BellSouth said that they conducted a "internal review" and that the review "confirmed no such contract exists and we have not provided bulk customer calling records to the NSA," said Jeff Battcher, spokesman for BellSouth. 

"We do not believe that any final review will turn up anything different from what we have currently found. There is no link between the NSA and BellSouth that we can find in what we feel is a very exhaustive review. We wouldn't have made this bold statement if we weren't confident about this," added Battcher.

AT&amp;T and Verizon Communications were also said to have handed over customer call logs, but Verizon said on Friday that they don't "and will not, provide any government agency unfettered access to our customer records or provide information to the government under circumstances that would allow a fishing expedition."

On Monday, Massachusetts Representative &lt;a href="w%3AEdward%20Markey"&gt;Edward Markey&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20Energy"&gt;House Energy&lt;/a&gt; and Commerce subcommittee on telecommunications asked for help from the &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Communications%20Commission"&gt;Federal Communications Commission&lt;/a&gt; or FCC, to investigate whether Verizon, AT&amp;T, and BellSouth violated privacy rights under communication laws and regulations.

On May 12 &lt;a href="w%3ARadio%20Free%20Asia"&gt;Radio Free Asia&lt;/a&gt; reported some people outside &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; will get a "server connection has been reset" error message when they are trying to search some political keywords on &lt;a href="w%3ABaidupedia"&gt;Baidupedia&lt;/a&gt;. However, the &lt;a href="w%3Ainternet%20censorship"&gt;Internet censorship&lt;/a&gt; is not just on Baidupedia because it's due to the keyword filtering technology on the &lt;a href="w%3AGreat%20Firewall%20of%20China"&gt;Great Firewall of China&lt;/a&gt;.

One of the first people to find this filtering technology was &lt;a href="w%3Azh%3A%E6%96%B9%E6%98%AF%E6%B0%91"&gt;Shi-Min Fang&lt;/a&gt;, a biochemist with a stance against ethical lapses in China. Fang, whose site "新語絲" has been blocked by the &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;PRC&lt;/a&gt; government for years, had found that his Chinese name cannot be searched since last August if someone outside China uses an Internet search engine that is based in China. He posted a message to his own forum. A forum visitor gave him a method to verify what he found. By randomly choosing a website URL that is in China and adding banned keywords to that URL, the server connection will be reset without displaying the normal "page does not exist" error message. Take &lt;a href="http%3A//www.163.com/%E5%85%AD%E5%9B%9B"&gt;http://www.163.com/六四&lt;/a&gt; for example, if you use that URL to link to the site when you are outside China, you will find the server connection will be reset.

A Chinese Wikinews reporter, , also performed this test. He chose some political keywords such as "民主" (&lt;a href="w%3ADemocracy"&gt;Democracy&lt;/a&gt;), "江泽民" (&lt;a href="w%3AJiang%20Zemin"&gt;Jiang Zemin&lt;/a&gt;), "法轮功" (&lt;a href="w%3AFalun%20Gong"&gt;Falun Gong&lt;/a&gt;) and asked people to search on &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABaidu"&gt;Baidu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASogou"&gt;Sogou&lt;/a&gt; (a Chinese search engine developed by &lt;a href="w%3ASohu"&gt;Sohu&lt;/a&gt;), and some Wikipedians from China, Taiwan and United States joined the test.

, Chinese tester Shi Zhao found there is no problem to search such political keywords on Chinese search engines other than Google. And Taiwanese testers , &lt;a href="w%3Azh%3AUser%3AAlexsh"&gt;Alex S.H. Lin&lt;/a&gt; and American tester &lt;a href="w%3Azh%3AUser%3AR.O.C"&gt;roc&lt;/a&gt; found they will get the "server connection has been reset" error message when they tried to search those political keywords on Chinese search engines other than Google.

From the test the testers believe that the keyword filtering technology on the Great Firewall of China is bi-directional. People outside China cannot visit any Chinese websites that have political keywords, and people in China cannot visit any websites outside China that has political keywords.

Baidupeida that went online this April is a service that provided by the Chinese Internet search company, &lt;a href="w%3ABaidu"&gt;Baidu&lt;/a&gt;, and its form is very similar to Wikipedia, which is blocked by the PRC government since last year. It would also allow users to join the editing on Baidupedia.

<h1>Ayaan Hirsi Ali leaves Dutch Parliament</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Ayaan%20Hirsi%20Ali%20leaves%20Dutch%20Parliament&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Dutch Member of Parliament &lt;a href="w%3AAyaan%20Hirsi%20Ali"&gt;Ayaan Hirsi Ali&lt;/a&gt; has announced she will leave parliament, after Minister of Immigration and Integration &lt;a href="w%3ARita%20Verdonk"&gt;Rita Verdonk&lt;/a&gt; announced that Hirsi Ali never obtained Dutch citizenship. 

In a press conference an emotional Ayaan Hirsi Ali announced that she will leave parliament and move to the United States to work with the conservative think tank &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Enterprise%20Institute"&gt;American Enterprise Institute&lt;/a&gt; in September after reaching a deal with US authorities concerning her security. Originally she was to have moved to the USA in May of 2007. In national paliament she will be replaced by Amsterdam government member &lt;a href="w%3Anl%3ALaetitia%20Griffith"&gt;Laetitia Griffith&lt;/a&gt; starting June 1.

The direct reason for Hirsi Ali's departure, is that Minister for Immigration and Integration and fellow party-member, Rita Verdonk has announced that Hirsi Ali never obtained Dutch citizenship, because she lied in her application for refugee status in the Netherlands. She claimed to be a refugee directly from war-torn Somalia and to have only narrowly escaped the threat of forced marriage. In fact, she had held a refugee status in Kenya at the time. She changed her name and date of birth. 

These facts, which Hirsi Ali previously divulged, were reported last Thursday (11 May 2006) by the Dutch television program "Zembla". She had already informed the public of these aspects of the story of her immigration to the Netherlands as early as September 2002 in an interview in the political magazine HP/De Tijd.

Media speculations arose that she could lose her Dutch Citizenship because of this 'identity fraud', rendering her ineligible for Parliament. In a first reaction Minister Rita Verdonk said she would not look into the matter, but after Member of Parliament &lt;a href="w%3Anl%3AHilbrand%20Nawijn"&gt;Hilbrand Nawijn&lt;/a&gt; insisted, she declared that she would investigate Hirsi Ali's naturalisation process. This investigation took three days. The findings were that Hirsi Ali never received Dutch citizenship after all, because she lied about her name and date of birth. She pretended to be Ayaan Hirsi Ali, born in 1967, but official records say Ayaan Hirsi Magan, born in 1969. Therefore Verdonk's position was that Hirsi Ali never received Dutch citizenship. After accusation by 
Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJan%20Peter%20Balkenende"&gt;Jan Peter Balkenende&lt;/a&gt; she works too much on her own and lacks team spirit she said to have no doubt Ayaan will be returned citizenship of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.

On May 16, Hirsi Ali resigned from Parliament after admitting lying on her asylum application. Hirsi Ali has announced that she will move to the United States in September 2006. There she will work on finishing her book ♡❤Shortcut to Enlightenment♡❤ and working for the conservative think tank American Enterprise Institute. In a reaction, former VVD-leader &lt;a href="w%3Anl%3AHans%20Wiegel"&gt;Hans Wiegel&lt;/a&gt; stated that her departure "would not be a loss to the VVD and not be a loss to the Tweede Kamer". Wiegel said that Hirsi Ali was a brave woman, but that her points of view were polarizing. Former parliamentary leader of the VVD, &lt;a href="w%3Anl%3AJozias%20van%20Aartsen"&gt;Jozias van Aartsen&lt;/a&gt;, was more positive about Hirsi Ali, saying that it is "painful for Dutch society and politics that she is leaving the Tweede Kamer".

Ayaan Hirsi Ali has been a member of parliament for the liberal Dutch &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Party%20for%20Freedom%20and%20Democracy"&gt;People's Party for Freedom and Democracy&lt;/a&gt; (VVD) and is known for her controversial positions on the relationship between women and islam.

The events surrounding Ayaan Hirsi Ali has had considerable effects on Dutch politics:

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Defense"&gt;Department of Defense&lt;/a&gt; (DOD) is releasing surveillance video showing &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Airlines%20Flight%2077"&gt;American Airlines flight 77&lt;/a&gt; hitting the &lt;a href="w%3APentagon"&gt;Pentagon&lt;/a&gt; on September 11, 2001. The video was taken from a Pentagon Security camera.

On December 15, 2004, a legal advocacy group called Judicial Watch filed a lawsuit against the DOD in an attempt to have the video released through the &lt;a href="w%3AFreedom%20of%20information%20legislation"&gt;Freedom of Information Act&lt;/a&gt;.

"We fought hard to obtain this video because we felt that it was very important to complete the public record with respect to the terrorist attacks of September 11," said Judicial Watch President, Tom Fitton.

"Finally, we hope that this video will put to rest the conspiracy theories involving American Airlines Flight 77. As always, our prayers remain with all those who suffered as a result of those murderous attacks," added Fitton.

According to the advocacy group, U.S. officials say they did not release the video earlier because it was part of the investigation into convicted plotter for al-Qaeda, Zacarias Moussaoui.

"Now that the trial of Zacarias Moussaoui is over, we are able to complete your request and provide the video," said chief of the Department of Defense, Office of Freedom of Information, William Kammer.

However; some are not sure what is shown on the video. 

Michael Berger, spokesman for 911Truth.org said "In fact, I thought that was underwhelming." and "It doesn't clarify anything — I don't see a plane in that image. We would like to know what happened. Four-and-a-half years later, we still don't have definitive proof that a plane hit that building." 

911Truth.org received five times the average visits to their website after the video's release on Tuesday. Mr. Berger's group is hosting a conference June 2 in Chicago where skeptics of the official explanation of 9/11 plan to work out a variety of scenarios that suggest the U.S. government's complicity in the September 11, 2001 attacks on the Pentagon and World Trade Center.

<h1>Controversy over translation of Norwegian national anthem</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Controversy%20over%20translation%20of%20Norwegian%20national%20anthem&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A suggestion to translate the national anthem of &lt;a href="w%3ANorway"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href="w%3AUrdu"&gt;Urdu&lt;/a&gt; is causing controversy. The &lt;a href="w%3AProgress%20Party%20%28Norway%29"&gt;Progress Party&lt;/a&gt; opposes the idea, saying that people who cannot understand Norwegian could just hum with the Norwegian citizens. Norway celebrated &lt;a href="w%3ASyttende%20Mai"&gt;Syttende Mai&lt;/a&gt;, its Constitution Day on May 17 with traditional children's parades last week. The song is usually sung on this occasion.

The editor of &lt;a href="w%3AUtrop"&gt;Utrop&lt;/a&gt;, a newspaper for the minorities in Norway, suggested the translation of the national anthem in an editorial in the national paper &lt;a href="w%3AV%C3%A5rt%20Land%20%28Norwegian%20newspaper%29"&gt;Vårt Land&lt;/a&gt;. Such a translation, he said, would allow immigrants of Pakistani origin to show their love for Norway by singing the Norwegian national anthem. The title of the national anthem is after all "&lt;a href="w%3AJa%2C%20vi%20elsker%20dette%20landet"&gt;Ja vi elsker (dette landet)&lt;/a&gt;" which translates as "Yes, we love (this country)."

"This is integration in reverse," said Per-Willy Amundsen, the Progress Party spokesman on issues dealing with immigration. According to him, "the best gift that the immigrants could give to Norway would be learning the language of their new homeland."

The state’s teachers and schools chief Jack O’Connell have settled their lawsuit against &lt;a href="w%3AGov.%20Arnold%20Schwarzenegger"&gt;Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger&lt;/a&gt; and, as a result, billions of dollars in school funding O’Connell and the teachers claimed the governor misappropriated during the state’s fiscal crisis will be returned to the schools.

"The restoration of funding to Califoria school districts is very positive news,” New Haven schools Superintendent Pat Jaurequi told the &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Logan%20Courier"&gt;James Logan Courier&lt;/a&gt;.

"This is a day for celebration in schools throughout California. When this lawsuit was filed, I promised that I would fight up and down the state until the funding owed to our schools was restored," O’Connell, the state superintendent of Public Instruction, said in a statement last week. "I also promised I would give the Governor credit for doing the right thing if he restored this critical funding. Today, I want to thank Governor Schwarzenegger for working with the education community to invest wisely in our schools — the best investment we can make in California’s future.”

“This is a good thing for our schools and community colleges throughout California,” said Barbara E. Kerr, president of the California Teachers Association, one of the parties to the lawsuit. “Having all the money owed to our schools under Proposition 98 and the governor’s agreement of 2004 restored to our students is the news we’ve been waiting for.

In a statement regarding the settlement, Schwarzenegger said, "I am pleased to announce a resolution that will put the dispute regarding Proposition 98 funding behind us and allow us to invest an additional $3 billion in schools in a way that best helps our students.”

Proposition 98 is an amendment to the state Constitution, passed in 1988, that established a minimum funding level or guarantee for K-12 education and community colleges. O’Connell and the California Teachers Association sued Schwarzenegger and the director for the California Department of Finance last summer after when they diverted billions of dollars earmarked for the schools under Prop. 98 to overcome budget deficits that were crippling California, violating an agreement made with educators the previous year.

The agreement restores funding Proposition 98 funding that was due, but not provided in the 2004-05 and 2005-06 fiscal years. The Governor’s May Budget Revision will include $2 billion and language that provides an additional $3 billion to be paid in installments between fiscal year 2006-07 and fiscal year 2013-14, or until paid in full.

In addition to the settlement funds, Schwarzenegger’s “May Budget Revision,” announced last week, also directs billions more of the state’s money to schools. Schwarzenegger said bulging state coffers, filled by unexpected tax revenues, allowed him to budget an extra 8.1 billion for schools, for a total of $55.1 billion-an over 17% overall funding increase from 2004-2005.

The settlement and the new budget figures “will allow us to make good on the debts to schools created through the recent lean years and to make important new investments in public education,” said O’Connell.

Schwarzenegger had some ideas about how the money should be spent. "For K-12 schools, I propose that we concentrate these funds to improve instruction in schools with low academic achievement. We should direct the funds to the classroom level for such things as lowering class size, attracting and supporting quality school leadership and fully credentialed and experienced teachers, supporting greater involvement of parents, providing more counselors in high schools, and increasing quality professional development, instructional materials, improved instruction and accountability.” he said.

Although pleased by the outcome of the lawsuit, Jaurequi was cautious about predicting its effect in New Haven “ It is significant to note that two-thirds of the new funding is one-time in nature and is not an ongoing revenue stream,” she said.

"Although the budget process is far from over and we will likely differ on some of his budget priorities, I am happy to thank Governor Schwarzenegger for working with the education community to invest in public education,” said O’Connell, who’s been embroiled in controversy and litigation over the California High School Exit Exam in recent weeks.

"I am particularly pleased to see that the Governor has increased funding to expand remediation programs for students who are struggling to pass the California High School Exit Exam, and to pay for new summer and evening administrations of the Exam,” said O’Connell, who wrote the law requiring the exam when he was a state legislator in 1998, “ I also applaud the increase in funding to expand and improve student nutrition programs giving more students the opportunity to make healthier food choices on campus. In addition, I am very happy to see additional funding for high school counselors. Our state currently has the lowest ratio of counselors to students in the nation. This is a statistic we need to improve upon "

Yesterday, at 10:39 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated_Universal_Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;, a 7.4 magnitude earthquake rocked the Pacific Ocean about 180 miles southwest of &lt;a href="w%3ARaoul%20Island"&gt;Raoul Island&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the &lt;a href="w%3AKermadec%20Islands"&gt;Kermadec Islands&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;. Witnesses disagreed on the length of the earthquake, which was felt as far south as Christchurch, New Zealand, although they agreed the quake lasted from 30 seconds to a minute. Ever since the &lt;a href="Remote%20New%20Zealand%20island%20evacuated%20as%20volcano%20erupts"&gt;volcano eruption on Raoul Island&lt;/a&gt; on March 18, the islands have been experiencing about 30 earthquakes a day. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center predicted that the earthquake might create a small &lt;a href="w%3Atsunami"&gt;tsunami&lt;/a&gt; with a radius of about 60 miles. There have been no reported injuries or deaths.

The tsunami occurred a couple of hours before a previously-scheduled test of a tsunami warning system. The test had 29 countries participating.

"It is a big earthquake, but the depth would limit any damage," Seismologist Ken Gledhill says.

<h1>Spanish Socialist Workers' Party proposes human rights bill for great apes</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Spanish%20Socialist%20Workers%27%20Party%20proposes%20human%20rights%20bill%20for%20great%20apes&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Spain’s &lt;a href="w%3ASpanish%20Socialist%20Workers%27%20Party"&gt;Partido Socialista Obrero Español&lt;/a&gt; (PSOE), the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, and the &lt;a href="w%3ALos_Verdes"&gt;Confederación de Los Verdes&lt;/a&gt;, the Green Party, proposed a bill to grant some human rights to all &lt;a href="w%3Agreat%20apes"&gt;great apes&lt;/a&gt; (), which include humans, bonobos, chimpanzees, gorillas and orang-utans. Humanity shares about 97% of its genome with the great apes.

The proposal was submitted by , a delegate of the Confederación de Los Verdes, and is inspired by the &lt;a href="w%3ADeclaration%20on%20Great%20Apes"&gt;Declaration on Great Apes&lt;/a&gt; published by the &lt;a href="w%3AGreat%20Ape%20Project"&gt;Great Ape Project&lt;/a&gt;. Founded in 1993, the Great Ape Project (GAP), calls for an extension of moral egalitarianism to encompass all great apes. The Declaration on Great Apes demands the right to live, the protection of individual liberty and the prohibition of torture for all great apes.

The proposal does not assign the lesser apes gibbons (), siamangs () or the new world anthropoids () similar rights. The latter include the species of the &lt;a href="w%3ACapuchin_monkey"&gt;capuchin monkeys&lt;/a&gt; (), a tool using species that possibly demonstrates a degree of self-awareness in the &lt;a href="w%3Amirror%20test"&gt;mirror test&lt;/a&gt; experiment.

The proposal is scheduled to be discussed in parliament at the end of May. After New Zealand, Spain would be the second country to grant special rights to apes.

<h2>Reactions to the proposal</h2>

The archbishop of Pamplona and Tudela, Fernando Sebastián, opposed the proposal as ridiculous, given the fact that monkeys would be granted more rights than unborn human embryos.

The president of the Spanish section of &lt;a href="w%3AAmnesty%20International"&gt;Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt;, Delia Register, expressed surprise at the idea to grant human rights to great apes when, at the present time, they aren't granted to all human beings.

&lt;a href="w%3APope%20Benedict%20XVI"&gt;Pope Benedict XVI&lt;/a&gt; today named &lt;a href="w%3ADonald%20Wuerl"&gt;Donald W. Wuerl&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABishop"&gt;Bishop&lt;/a&gt; of Pittsburgh, to be the new &lt;a href="w%3AArchbishop%20of%20Washington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Archbishop of Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;, succeeding &lt;a href="w%3ACardinal%20%28Catholicism%29"&gt;Cardinal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATheodore%20Cardinal%20McCarrick"&gt;Theodore E. McCarrick&lt;/a&gt;, who had held the position for the last five years. McCarrick presented his resignation upon turning 75 to the Pope, as is custom for all Bishops.

Prior to his new appointment, Bishop Wuerl had overseen the over 800,000 Catholics in the Pittsburgh community for the last 18 years. A native of Pittsburgh, the Bishop was educated in Rome and spent time serving in the &lt;a href="w%3ADiocese%20of%20Seattle"&gt;Diocese of Seattle&lt;/a&gt;.

The new position is significant because of its location. The prelate of the &lt;a href="w%3ADiocese%20of%20Washington"&gt;Diocese of Washington&lt;/a&gt; is often the most influential because of its frequent contacts with the White House, Congress and the rest of the government. Wuerl said he was prepared to accept his new role as one of the foremost spiritual leaders of the American arm of the Church.

The &lt;a href="w%3ADiocese%20of%20Pittsburgh"&gt;Diocese of Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt; consists of Allegheny, Washington, Butler, Beaver, Greene and Lawrence counties in the state of Pennsylvania.

&lt;a href="w%3APietro%20Sambi"&gt;Archbishop Pietro Sambi&lt;/a&gt;, apostolic nuncio to the United States, made the announcement of Bishop Wuerl’s appointment this morning, and a press conference was held in Washington at 10 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3AEastern_Daylight_Time"&gt;EDT&lt;/a&gt;. A following press conference will be held at 6 p.m. EDT with Wuerl in &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Paul%20Seminary"&gt;St. Paul Seminary&lt;/a&gt;, Pittsburgh. The Archbishop of Washington is traditionally a Cardinal, so there is the possibility that Wuerl will soon be elevated to Cardinal status.

The &lt;a href="w%3AHawaii"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt; state legislature has appropriated US$4.9 million to fight the &lt;a href="w%3Acoqui"&gt;coqui frog&lt;/a&gt; and other invasive species.

About $2.9 million will be used to hire 58 additional inspectors at Hawaii's airports to improve detection of invasive species, an increase of 75% over the current level. The remaining $2 million will be used specifically for coqui frog eradication using &lt;a href="w%3Acitric%20acid"&gt;citric acid&lt;/a&gt; and hydrated lime.

Much of the money will go to the Big Island of Hawaii, where the coqui frog infestation is most serious. About $1.8 million will go to the Big Island, with $150,000 going to Maui and $50,000 each going to Oahu and Kauai.

Native to the Caribbean, the coqui frog is believed to have entered on plants shipped from Florida or Puerto Rico. Without natural predators, the frogs' population density has grown to the point where it has become a nuisance. It is best known for its loud chirping, which keeps some residents on the Big Island and Maui awake at night.

Ecologists also fear that the coquis could threaten native bird species by eating the insects the birds rely on for food.

The test started at the Tsunami Warning Centre in Hawaii where a fake 9.2 magnitude earthquake occurred near Chile, starting a tsunami rolling across the pacific.

A second fake earthquake happened north of the Philippines to test the responses in the Western Pacific.

New Zealand's Civil Defence has recently come under fire for failing to do enough to protect its citizens after international news agencies warned that a tsunami, which never arrived, was expected to hit New Zealand.

The New Zealand Government's emergency management plan has also been criticised for being too unclear and insufficient.

The two &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n mine-workers, who were trapped for 14 days underground in a collapsed mine, have signed a media deal reportedly worth AUD$2 million for their story of survival. Local media reports that the lucrative deal, announced by the Nine Network, is believed to be the "highest ever paid to secure news talent". A planned TV special will be the outcome of a deal secured by &lt;a href="w%3APublishing%20and%20Broadcasting%20Limited"&gt;Publishing and Broadcasting Limited (PBL)&lt;/a&gt;, which owns the &lt;a href="w%3ANine%20Network"&gt;Nine Network&lt;/a&gt;. 

Miners Todd Russell and Brant Webb were entombed nearly a kilometre underground following a cave-in on April 25 at the Beaconsfield Gold Mine in &lt;a href="Tasmania"&gt;Tasmania&lt;/a&gt;. A third miner, Larry Knight, was killed in the rock-fall. The two survivors trapped in a wire cage, survived by drinking water seeping through rocks until rescuers managed to dig a small tunnel to deliver fresh food and water. Their tale has captured the attention of the nation, with media corporations fighting for exclusive rights to the miners' story.

The Nine Network's chief executive Eddie McGuire said under the PBL deal, Woman's Day, the Australian Women's Weekly and the Bulletin magazines would also have access to the men. The Nine Network has announced it would broadcast a two-hour special with entitled "The Great Escape."

Another deal is expected to be brokered with &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; media. Mr McGuire said the deal would not restrict the pair from selling their story to CNN, the US Today Show and Good Morning America, who have all reportedly made contact with Mr Russell and Mr Webb this week. 

Under the PBL deal, Woman's Day, the Australian Women's Weekly and the Bulletin magazines would also have access to the men, Mr McGuire said. Nine says it also wants the footage and photographs taken by the miners during their ordeal. The footage remains in the hands of the mining company.

The men, who were rescued on May 9, have not spoken publicly about the time they spent trapped underground.

An audit conducted by &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia's&lt;/a&gt; Auditor general has found &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20dollar"&gt;AUD&lt;/a&gt; $1 billion worth of munitions (bombs, explosives and ammunition) stockpiled by Australia's defence forces are unusable in their present state. Australia holds $2 billion worth of munition stock.

Of the $1 billion considered unusable, $300 million is unrepairable and needs to be disposed of. The unusable munitions are waiting to be detonated at the Woomera weapons range in remote &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Australia"&gt;South Australia&lt;/a&gt;.

The audit also found that the defence department did not have the knowledge to safely store and maintain bombs and other ammunition.

Following the report being tabled in parliament today, the government has ordered a review into the process by which munitions are purchased by the country. Speaking to a defence industry conference in &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;, Australian defence minister, &lt;a href="Brendan%20Nelson"&gt;Brendan Nelson&lt;/a&gt; said the government would be conducting a three-month inquiry into how Australian defence forces purchase munitions and equipment.

At present defence supplies are purchased by the Defence Materials Organisation (DMO) with no firm policy or guidelines from the government.

The federal opposition has seized upon the audit saying it also mentioned that payments made to contractors prior to supply had not been adequately explained by the DMO.

Senator Mark Bishop, the Opposition defence industry spokesman said that the DMO paid more than $20 million on a $26 million contract for missiles prior to being supplied. Senator Bishop also said that the DMO "negotiated a series of benefits that never materialised".

Senator Bishop said that the DMO could not justify the payments to the auditor general. "The DMO could not provide documentation to justify these prepayments and the auditor questions the validity of the prepayments," Senator Bishop said.

Former world champion boxer &lt;a href="w%3AAnthony_Mundine"&gt;Anthony Mundine&lt;/a&gt; has beaten long-time rival &lt;a href="w%3ADanny_Green"&gt;Danny Green&lt;/a&gt; on a unanimous points decision in a non-title &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Boxing%20Association"&gt;World Boxing Association&lt;/a&gt; (WBA) super middleweight bout. Mundine, an ex-rugby league star promoted the much-anticipated fight that attracted around 40,000 spectators and a national record for a pay-per-view television event. 

"Who's the man, who's the man?" Mundine asked the crowd after the fight. Western &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;'s Danny Green (the "Machine") was defeated after 12 rounds at the &lt;a href="w%3ASydney%20Football%20Stadium"&gt;Sydney Football Stadium&lt;/a&gt; by "the Man" Mundine. Mundine has improved his overall record to 26 wins and three losses. His victory sets up a world title bout against &lt;a href="Denmark"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AMikkel%20Kessler"&gt;Mikkel Kessler&lt;/a&gt;. 

After the bout Mundine praised his opponent's tenacity: "I just wanna' thank Danny for a great fight... I was starting to get loose man, Danny was starting to put a lot of pressure on me, he's got a good long jab, I had to evade that," said Mundine. "I utilized my speed to catch him and it paid dividends. I was looking for the knockout, I caught him with a few great shots, [and] he can take a great punch. He put up a good performance. He come around, he come prepared - I was the better man tonight Dan, thank you very much. We can do it again maybe, soon." 

Green agreed that Mundine fought the better fight. "He just beat me fair and square. I have no excuses at all, I trained unbelievable, my preparation was great... Anthony was the better man tonight," said Green.

The WBA fight consolidated six years of taunts and hyperbole to settle a long-running feud between the men and their supporters. According to media reports the battle was personal from the outset with Mundine's mother Lyn yelling at her son from ringside to "Knock him out Choc, shut him up my baby". 

Sports media commentators reported that the pace remained hectic in the first four rounds as Mundine stood firm and used his jab as Green mixed his trademark "power punches." As the fight wore on, Mundine appeared in greater control and in better condition. However, Mundine did end up on the canvas in the seventh round, after being pushed through the ropes by Green. 

Throughout the fight, Green's power punches "missed, missed and missed again". In the final "ferocious" round, Mundine rocked Green with a combination to the head, taunting Green to "Come on." Green attempted plenty of combinations, but Mundine's speed caused problems. After 12 rounds, Judge Pinit Prayadsab from &lt;a href="Thailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt; gave the fight to Mundine 118-11, &lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;n Michael Lee scored it 116-113 and Australian Derek Milham had it 118-112.

Australian newspapers report that the appreciative crowd included corporate CEOs, former world heavyweight champion &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Frazier"&gt;Joe Frazier&lt;/a&gt;, bikie gangs, peroxide blondes and rugby league players. Referee Terry O'Connor described the event as a fight Australia can be proud of. "They both gave their all, it was a great fight." He described the atmosphere at Aussie Stadium as "fantastic" "It was the greatest fight I have refereed, it was brilliant," O'Connor said. 

The "Man v Machine" event fight, promoted by Mundine's Boxa International and the "Green Machine" promoters is believed to have beeen the "biggest boxing match in Australian history", grossing an estimated $20 million. Each boxer is reported to be earning a seven-figure sum, while spectators have paid up to &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20dollar"&gt;A$&lt;/a&gt;1000 for a seat at the bout. Foxtel reported record sales for their exclusive pay-per-view event, claiming that subscriptions outsold the &lt;a href="w%3ALennox%20Lewis"&gt;Lennox Lewis&lt;/a&gt; v &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Tyson"&gt;Mike Tyson&lt;/a&gt; heavyweight bout. Heavy betting ensued with one punter laying a $500,000 bet on Mundine to take the honours.

Of his upcoming bout with Denmark's Mikkel Kessler, Mundine said: "It was a close fight last time. I think he's the best fighter out there, but I've shown I can match it with him. I'm ready."

<h1>News briefs:May 17, 2006</h1>
The time is 18:00 (UTC) on May 17th, 2006, and this is Audio Wikinews News Briefs.
<h2>Headlines</h2>
<h3>&lt;a href="Culture%20of%20violence%20reported%20in%20central%20Australian%20Aboriginal%20communities"&gt;Culture of violence reported in central Australian Aboriginal communities&lt;/a&gt;</h3>

Australia

Australian media reports that a recently leaked Northern Territory police briefing paper exposes "shocking" cases of sexual abuse and violence against women and children in remote Australian Aboriginal communities.
Central Australian Crown prosecutor, Dr Nannette Rogers, detailed a range of "dreadful" cases she had prosecuted.
<h3></h3>

Iran

In response to European Union offers of a light water reactor in exchange for the halting of Iran's uranium enrichment, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad spoke to supporters in the central city of Arak, dismissing them as being "candy for gold".
"They say they want to give us incentives! Do you think you are dealing with a four year old child to whom you can give some walnuts and chocolates and get gold from him?"
Ahmadinejad has ruled out any suspension of its nuclear programme, finding its previous halt of two years a "bitter experience".
<h3>&lt;a href="Half%20of%20Australian%20defence%20force%27s%20munitions%20of%20no%20use"&gt;Half of Australian defence force's munitions of no use&lt;/a&gt;</h3>

Australia

An audit conducted by Australia's Auditor general has found AUD$1 billion worth of munitions (bombs, explosives and ammunition) stockpiled by Australia's defence forces are unusable in their present state. Australia holds AUD$2 billion worth of munition stock.
Of the AUD$1 billion considered unsuable, $300 million is unrepairable and needs to be disposed of. The unusable munitions are waiting to be detonated at the Woomera weapons range in remote South Australia.
<h3>&lt;a href="Rescued%20Australian%20miners%20sign%20multi-million%20dollar%20media%20deal"&gt;Rescued Australian miners sign multi-million dollar media deal&lt;/a&gt;</h3>

Australia

The two Australian mine-workers, who were trapped for 14 days underground in a collapsed mine, have signed a media deal reportedly worth AUD$2 million for their story of survival. Local media reports that the lucrative deal, announced by the Nine Network, is believed to be the "highest ever paid to secure news talent". A planned TV special will be the outcome of a deal secured by Publishing and Broadcasting Limited (PBL), which owns the Nine Network.
<h3>&lt;a href="Hawaii%20to%20spend%20%244.9M%20on%20coqui%20frog%20eradication"&gt;Hawaii to spend $4.9M on coqui frog eradication&lt;/a&gt;</h3>

United States

The Hawaii state legislature has appropriated US$4.9 million to fight the coqui frog and other invasive species.
About $2.9 million will be used to hire 58 additional inspectors at Hawaii's airports to improve detection of invasive species, an increase of 75% over the current level. The remaining $2 million will be used specifically for coqui frog eradication using citric acid and hydrated lime.

On May 11, 2006, the ♡❤&lt;a href="USA%20Today"&gt;USA Today&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ published an article claiming that the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="National%20Security%20Agency"&gt;National Security Agency&lt;/a&gt; (NSA) collected millions of call logs from telecommunications companies in 2001 under a contract the NSA claims to have had with phone companies.

Since the publication, telecommunications giant &lt;a href="w%3AVerizon"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt; has denied that customer phone records where handed over to the NSA in the time frame "from the time of the 9/11 attacks until just four months ago." 

"Contrary to the media reports, Verizon was not asked by NSA to provide, nor did Verizon provide, customer phone records from any of these businesses, or any call data from those records. None of these companies -- wireless or wireline -- provided customer records or call data," Verizon said in a statement. This does not address the question whether the long-stance carrier &lt;a href="w%3AMCI%20WorldCom"&gt;MCI&lt;/a&gt;, that Verizon bought in January, handed over records to the NSA, and whether they still continue to do so.

Verizon also says that records from local calls are not tracked. "Phone companies do not even make records of local calls in most cases because the vast majority of customers are not billed per call for local calls."

On Tuesday, &lt;a href="w%3ABellSouth"&gt;BellSouth&lt;/a&gt; also denied that it gave their call records to the NSA.

However; ♡❤USA Today♡❤ said that they are "confident" about their story and "will look closely into the issues raised by the BellSouth and Verizon statements. Sources told us that BellSouth and Verizon records are included in the database," said Steve Anderson, spokesman for ♡❤USA Today♡❤. The paper was using anonymous sources that they claim had "direct knowledge of the arrangement." Anderson also stated that they will not "dismiss" the denials made by Verizon or BellSouth "without taking a closer look"

&lt;a href="w%3AQwest"&gt;Qwest&lt;/a&gt;'s former chief executive Joseph P. Nacchio confirmed through his lawyer that the NSA requested Qwest to provide calling data, but that Qwest declined to do so citing a lack of legal process.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=College%20ice%20hockey%20could%20follow%20NHL%20and%20add%20second%20referee&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

University of Maine men's ice hockey head coach Tim Whitehead has proposed that the National Collegiate Athletic Association adopt the four-official system.

The system, which has two referees and two linesmen, was adopted by the National Hockey League for the 1998/99 season on a trial basis before being fully implemented for 2000/01.

“My rationale for the proposal is to get more calls right,” Whitehead told the HockeyRefs.com website. “It’s about getting the best system we can for the game.”

Maine competes in Hockey East, one of six Division I conferences. Currently, Division I employs a three-official system of one referee and two assistant referees. 

Adding a second referee could result in logistical and financial difficulties for both conferences and schools.

“This would open a lot of opportunities,” said Whitehead, who isn’t opposed to young, college-age officials doing his games if “they’re the best out there.”

The NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Rules Committee will vote on the proposal in June

The world's largest package delivery company, &lt;a href="w%3AUPS"&gt;UPS&lt;/a&gt; has announced a $1 billion dollar expansion at its &lt;a href="w%3ALouisville%2C%20Kentucky"&gt;Louisville, Kentucky&lt;/a&gt; air hub to meet their projected future demands. The expansion will add an estimated 5,000 jobs and make the facility the size of 113 football fields when completed in 2010. It will make the facility capable of handling nearly 500,000 packages an hour. 

UPS is already the largest employer in Kentucky with nearly 18,000 employees. Many of the positions are part time and are held by students from the University of Louisville and Jefferson Community College, with whom UPS has a tuition reimbursement deal.

US stocks plunged along with other stock markets overseas as a greater than expected rise in consumer prices fueled investors' fears that the &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Reserve"&gt;Federal Reserve's&lt;/a&gt; campaign of raising &lt;a href="w%3Ainterest%20rates"&gt;interest rates&lt;/a&gt; is not over. At the close of trading at 4:00 PM EDT, the &lt;a href="w%3ADow%20Jones%20Industrial%20Average"&gt;Dow Jones Industrial Average&lt;/a&gt; had fallen 214.28 points, or 1.88%, to 11,205.61. Technology stocks were not safe from the selling as well, as the &lt;a href="w%3ANASDAQ"&gt;NASDAQ&lt;/a&gt; fell 33.33 points, or 1.50%, to 2,195.80. The NASDAQ has now turned negative for 2006. Broader stock indices also finished much lower. The &lt;a href="w%3AS%26amp%3BP%20500"&gt;S&amp;P 500&lt;/a&gt; fell 22 points (1.68%) to 1,270.32. This is the biggest point loss on the Dow in 3 years.

The &lt;a href="w%3AConsumer%20Price%20Index"&gt;Consumer Price Index&lt;/a&gt; (CPI) showed that prices to the consumer increased by a greater-than-expected 0.6% in April. Core CPI, which factors out volatile food and energy prices, swelled by a greater-than-expected 0.3%.

Market breadth was extremely negative with advancers beating out decliners by a 5 to 1 ratio on the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Stock%20Exchange"&gt;New York Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt;. Volume was heavy with 2.95 billion shares changing hands. Of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow Jones Industrials, 29 of them closed down for the day. The only stock in positive territory was &lt;a href="w%3AHewlett-Packard"&gt;Hewlett-Packard&lt;/a&gt;, which closed up $1.05 (+3.38%) to $32.16/share after reporting quarterly earnings after the close Tuesday.

The selloff comes on the heels of the Dow rising to within 80 points of its all-time closing high of 11,722.98 just last week. That rally was built on hopes that the Federal Reserve was close to ending its interest rate hike campaign. Since that time the Dow has experienced 3 double-digit point losses. Many market analysts and technicians, including Ken Tower from &lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Schwab%20Corporation"&gt;Schwab's&lt;/a&gt; CyberTrader, felt that the market was overbought and was due for a short-term correction. Today's &lt;a href="w%3Ainflation"&gt;inflation&lt;/a&gt; report suggests that the Fed might have to tighten interest rates further to combat inflation and slow economic growth to a more sustainable pace. Higher interest rates increase the cost of money, thus discouraging borrowing by businesses and individuals. 
European stock markets fell more sharply than those in the US. London's &lt;a href="w%3AFTSE%20100%20Index"&gt;FTSE&lt;/a&gt; fell 2.92%, Frankfurt's &lt;a href="w%3ADAX%20Index"&gt;DAX&lt;/a&gt; tumbled 3.4%, and Paris' &lt;a href="w%3ACAC%2040%20Index"&gt;CAC 40&lt;/a&gt; fell 3.18%.

<h1>FBI searching Michigan farm for clues in disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=FBI%20searching%20Michigan%20farm%20for%20clues%20in%20disappearance%20of%20Jimmy%20Hoffa&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AFBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABloomfield%20Township%2C%20Michigan"&gt;Bloomfield Township, Michigan&lt;/a&gt; Police are searching land on a horse farm in &lt;a href="w%3AMilford%2C%20Michigan"&gt;Milford Michigan&lt;/a&gt; for clues or evidence related to former Teamsters union leader, &lt;a href="w%3AJimmy%20Hoffa"&gt;Jimmy Hoffa&lt;/a&gt; who was 62 when he went missing in 1975. The FBI received a tip a few weeks ago from a FBI source which authorities believe is credible and detailed enough to warrant a search of the property.

The FBI says that the search is "in connection with the ongoing investigation into James Riddle Hoffa's disappearance, for evidence of criminal activity that may have occurred under prior ownership," said Dawn Clenney, a special agent for the FBI. "This is one [tip] we felt we needed to follow up on," added Clenney.

However; Barbara Ann Crancer, the daughter of Hoffa said "We've been down this road many times before. All they told me is a new tip came in and they were going to search somewhere in Milford. It's always a shock when it all comes rushing back again."

Previous searches and claim have turned up nothing. Most recently, in May 2004, official Frank Sheeran for the Philadelphia Teamsters said in a biography that he was the one to kill Hoffa by shooting and killing Hoffa in a Detroit home. A Detorit TV station, WJBK investigated the claims and found blood in the home, but tests proved that it did not belong to Hoffa. His body was also previously suspected of being buried in Giant's Stadium in the endzone in &lt;a href="w%3AMeadowlands%2C%20New%20Jersy"&gt;Meadowlands, New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;, a trash facility linked to the mob in &lt;a href="w%3AHamtramck%2C%20Michigan"&gt;Hamtramck&lt;/a&gt;, and a landfill also in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Jersey"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;.

Authorities say that the search could take several days to complete and that heavy digging equipment will be brought in on Thursday to assist in digging four locations on the land.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; opposition leader &lt;a href="w%3AKim%20beazley"&gt;Kim Beazley&lt;/a&gt; is expected to release his workplace plan when he will speak to a union delegate meeting in &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; today.

At the meeting today, there will be delegates from the Construction Forestry Mining Energy Union (CFMEU), Energy Union, Australian Manufacturing Workers Union (AMFU) and Australian Workers Union (AWU).

Under the plan, employers will be prevented from employing overseas migrants for 12 months after sacking Australian workers from the same job.

In a statement, Andrew Ferguson, CFMEU's NSW Secretary said that his union is contacted regularly after Australian workers are sacked for less expensive overseas labor. "There is not a day that goes by that people don't contact the union looking for help finding a job because employers are importing cheap labour rather than investing in Australian workers".

Mr Ferguson welcomed the opposition's incentives. "Kim Beazley's proposal is a welcome step forward in rectifying the short-sighted policies of a government that has completely failed to look out for the interests of working Australians."

&lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="Stephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt; asked for and received the approval of the &lt;a href="Canadian%20House%20of%20Commons"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt; (Lower House of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AParliament%20of%20Canada"&gt;Parliament of Canada&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) for a two year extension of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACanada%27s%20role%20in%20the%20invasion%20of%20Afghanistan"&gt;current mission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday. 

The Prime minister is not required to seek approval of the House of Commons to deploy forces, and Mr. Harper opened the 6 hour debate by declaring he would extend the mission by a year, with or without support from the Commons. 

Prior to the parliamentary debate, the Conservative government consulted the three opposition parties. The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABloc%20Quebecois"&gt;Bloc Quebecois&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;New Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; voted against the motion.

Thirty members of the Official Opposition, voted for the extension. &lt;a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;The Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt; allowed their members a free vote on the measure, and the majority opposed. Voting for the measure, interim leader &lt;a href="Bill%20Graham"&gt;Bill Graham&lt;/a&gt; said MPs were not given sufficient time to debate the issues, and were voting "with a gun put to our heads." 

NDP leader &lt;a href="Jack%20Layton"&gt;Jack Layton&lt;/a&gt; said the Conservatives were on the "wrong path". The extension in Afghanistan, he said before the vote, would "render Canada incapable of responding to other situations in the world."

The minority government received Commons approval by only four votes: 149-145.

Tragically, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACaptain%20Nicola%20Goddard"&gt;Captain Nicola Goddard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a Canadian female soldier posted in Afghanistan, was killed by Taliban rebels on the day of the debate.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACPAC"&gt;CPAC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (the Canadian Public Affairs Channel) carried both the full debate and the subsequent vote to extend the mission.

Australia is committed to a similar extension. The Prime Minister of Australia will arrive today, (18/05/2006), for a state visit to address the Parliament of Canada and attend various functions.

The &lt;a href="w%3ABombay%20Stock%20Exchange"&gt;Bombay Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt; Senstitive Index (Sensex) crashed 826 points and the National Stock Exchange's index (Nifty) 246 in what was the largest ever intra-day drop in the their histories. At the end of day's trade, the &lt;a href="w%3ASensex"&gt;Sensex&lt;/a&gt; closed at 11,391 and the Nifty at 3,388. The market breadth is also negative - 2081 shares have declined, with only 336 stocks advancing.

Analysts speculated that the reason for this drop was that the U.S. CPI number, which was released yesterday, was above expectations. This, coupled with weaknesses observed in the London Metal Exchange, has led to losses in emerging markets like India, Mexico, and Brazil.

Asian Regional Strategist at &lt;a href="w%3AJPMorgan%20Chase%20%26amp%3B%20Co."&gt;JPMorgan Chase&lt;/a&gt;, Adrian Mowat, believes that the Sensex will stabilise at around the 11,000 mark after correcting by around 5-6%. Indian Finance Minister P. Chidambaram dismissed the issue and described it as a routine fluctuation. The main losers in today's crash were the steel and cement segments.

The &lt;a href="w%3ACanterbury_Bulldogs"&gt;Canterbury Bulldogs&lt;/a&gt;, a team in &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Rugby%20League"&gt;National Rugby League&lt;/a&gt;, has entered into an agreement with &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; police to provide extra police at all games in NSW. The agreement follows a spate of violent incidents at Bulldogs matches this year.

In March, there were fights during and after a game between the Bulldogs and &lt;a href="w%3AWests%20Tigers"&gt;Wests Tigers&lt;/a&gt; at Telstra Stadium, the Bulldogs home ground. This led police to step up their presence at Bulldogs matches for the rest of the season. A month later, a group of Bulldogs supporters abused four &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Sydney%20Rabbitohs"&gt;South Sydney&lt;/a&gt; cheerleaders at another home match.

According to NSW Police, a meeting was held between the police executive and Bulldogs CEO, Malcolm Noad where it was decided that the club will pay for additional police at all Bulldogs games across NSW. The additional police will include specialist police (including riot police) to provide security for spectators.

Only police that are working outside their normal rostered hours will be paid for by the club.

The police Commander of the North West Sydney region, Assistant Commissioner said he was pleased that the club was working with the police proactively. “It is pleasing to see the club taking a proactive stance to ensure the games proceed with a strong police presence to provide increased safety” he said.

Assistant Commissioner Clifford warned that police would not be specifically targeting Bulldogs supporters, but anyone who is causing trouble at games. “It is hoped this initiative will stamp out violence at future Bulldogs matches. Police will be targeting anyone doing the wrong thing, regardless of which team they support,” he said.

In his first speech since being sworn in as the country's leader, &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ARomano%20Prodi"&gt;Romano Prodi&lt;/a&gt; says the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;-led invasion of &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; had been a mistake. He says his new government will propose the withdrawal of Italy's 3000 troops from Iraq. 

"We consider the war in Iraq and the occupation of the country a grave error," Mr Prodi told Italian Parliament this week. "It has not resolved, but complicated the situation of security. It is the intention of this government to propose to Parliament the return of our troops from Iraq." His speech resulted in jeers from Italy's centre right parties.

Mr Prodi said his government intends to continue "good relations" with Washington. He did not give a date for a withdrawal, saying a "technical timeframe" would have to be agreed with all sides involved. Italy's centre-left parties opposed the US-led invasion of Iraq three years ago. 

Mr Prodi said his government will remain on the front lines in the war against terror and would participate in anti-terror operations if they were sanctioned by international organizations, such as the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;. "We are convinced participants in the war against terrorism, even militarily, when it is legitimized by an international organization to which we belong." he said.

Former Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ASilvio%20Berlusconi"&gt;Silvio Berlusconi&lt;/a&gt; was defeated in a tight election to Prodi's &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Union%20%28political%20coalition%29"&gt;centre-left bloc&lt;/a&gt; in April this year. As opposition leader, Prodi has always opposed the war in Iraq. Berlusconi sent 3,000 troops to Iraq in 2003. The move was widely opposed by the Italian public. 

Although troops were already expected to return home by the end of 2006, Prodi did not give an exact timeframe for the withdrawal. He said it would only happen in consultation with Iraqi authorities.

A &lt;a href="w%3Acholera"&gt;cholera&lt;/a&gt; epidemic in &lt;a href="w%3AAngola"&gt;Angola&lt;/a&gt; has killed over 1,200 people in the past three months. The UN &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organization"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WHO) says about 35,000 people have fallen ill, half the victims in the capital of Luanda, where the first cases were detected in February. 

The UN say the epidemic is Angola’s worst cholera outbreak in almost two decades continues to rage on with 546 new cases and 31 deaths reported in the last 24 hours. A third of the victims are children under 5.

The medical charity Mangola, Medecines Sans Frontieres and the World Health Organisation say it is the worst outbreak recorded in the country. Spokesman for Medecines Sans Frontiere Richard Veerman said: "Angola is heading for its worst ever outbreak and the situation remains very bad in Angola," he said. 

"It's very worrying, the official number of deaths countrywide is now more than 1,200, which is likely under-reported. Many people will be at home and die at home and have no possibility to come to one of our treatment centres."

Cholera, an acute intestinal disease caused by ingestion of food or water contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, causes copious, painless, watery diarrhoea that can quickly lead to severe dehydration and death if treatment, including rehydration, is not given promptly.

Prime Minister of Nepal, Giriraj Koirala proposed in Parliament a resolution which is aimed at drastically curtailing the monarch's powers. According to the resolution, the King will be stripped of his status as the Supreme Commander of the Royal Nepal Army (which is to be renamed as the Nepal Army Cabinet). Portions of the Nepalese national anthem that praise the King have been cut.

The proposal also aims at cutting down on the King's allowance and his right to be exempted from paying taxes. The government which is currently referred to as the "King's administration" will henceforth be known as the "Nepalese Government". The resolution also changes Nepal's status from that of a Hindu nation to a secular one. The King's Advisory Council will no longer exist and his security will be taken care of by Parliament. The King will also now no longer have the privilege of being above the law of the land since the resolution provides for him to be tried in court if the situation so warrants.

Analysts have expressed concerns saying that under the current Constitution, this proposal cannot become law till the King signs it. Politicians say however that this proposal is above the Constitution and reflects the will of the people. King Gyanendra restored democracy to the Himalayan Kingdom after weeks of massive anti-monarchy protests earlier this year.

Stardust is a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; space capsule that collected samples from comet &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A81P/Wild"&gt;81P/Wild&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (also known as "Wild 2) in deep space and landed back on Earth on January 15, 2006. It was decided that a collaborative online review process would be used to "discover" the microscopically small samples the capsule collected. The project is called &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStardust%40home"&gt;Stardust@home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Unlike &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Adistributed%20computing"&gt;distributed computing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; projects like &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASETI%40home"&gt;SETI@home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Stardust@home relies entirely on human intelligence.

Andrew Westphal is the director of Stardust@home. Wikinews interviewed him for May's Interview of the Month (IOTM) on May 18, 2006. As always, the interview was conducted on &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIRC"&gt;IRC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , with multiple people asking questions.

♡❤♡ Some may not know exactly what Stardust or Stardust@home is. Can you explain more about it for us?♡❤♡
Stardust is a NASA Discovery mission that was launched in 1999. It is really two missions in one. The primary science goal of the mission was to collect a sample from a known primitive solar-system body, a comet called Wild 2 (pronounced "Vilt-two" &amp;mdash; the discoverer was German, I believe). This is the first &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; "sample return" mission since &lt;a href="Apollo%20program"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt;, and the first ever from beyond the moon. This gives a little context. By "sample return" of course I mean a mission that brings back extraterrestrial material. I should have said above that this is the first "solid" sample return mission &amp;mdash; Genesis brought back a sample from the Sun almost two years ago, but Stardust is also bringing back the first solid samples from the local interstellar medium &amp;mdash; basically this is a sample of the Galaxy. This is absolutely unprecedented, and we're obviously incredibly excited. I should mention parenthetically that there is a fantastic launch video &amp;mdash; taken from the POV of the rocket on the JPL Stardust website &amp;mdash; highly recommended &amp;mdash; best I've ever seen &amp;mdash; all the way from the launch pad, too. Basically interplanetary trajectory. Absolutely great. 

♡❤♡Is the video available to the public?♡❤♡

Yes [see &lt;a href="%23External%20links"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;]. OK, I digress. The first challenge that we have before can do any kind of analysis of these interstellar dust particles is simply to find them. This is a big challenge because they are very small (order of micron in size) and are somewhere (we don't know where) on a HUGE collector&amp;mdash; at least on the scale of the particle size &amp;mdash; about a tenth of a square meter. ♡❤So♡❤...

We're right now using an automated microscope that we developed several years ago for nuclear astrophysics work to scan the collector in the Cosmic Dust Lab in Building 31 at Johnson Space Center. This is the ARES group that handles returned samples (Moon Rocks, Genesis chips, Meteorites, and Interplanetary Dust Particles collected by U2 in the stratosphere). The microscope collects stacks of digital images of the aerogel collectors in the array. These images are sent to us &amp;mdash; we compress them and convert them into a format appropriate for Stardust@home. 

Stardust@home is a highly distributed project using a "Virtual Microscope" that is written in html and javascript and runs on most browsers &amp;mdash; no downloads are required. Using the Virtual Microscope volunteers can search over the collector for the tracks of the interstellar dust particles. 

♡❤♡How many samples do you anticipate being found during the course of the project?♡❤♡

Great question. The short answer is that we don't know. The long answer is a bit more complicated. Here's what we know. The Galileo and Ulysses spacecraft carried dust detectors onboard that Eberhard Gruen and his colleagues used to first detect and them measure the flux of interstellar dust particles streaming into the solar system. (This is a kind of "wind" of interstellar dust, caused by the fact that our solar system is moving with respect to the local interstellar medium.) Markus Landgraf has estimated the number of interstellar dust particles that should have been captured by Stardust during two periods of the "cruise" phase of the interplanetary orbit in which the spacecraft was moving with this wind. He estimated that there should be around 45 particles, but this number is very uncertain &amp;mdash; I wouldn't be surprised if it is quite different from that. That was the long answer! One thing that I should say...is that like all research, the outcome of what we are doing is highly uncertain. There is a wonderful quote attributed to Einstein &amp;mdash; "If we knew what we were doing, it wouldn't be called "research", would it?" 

♡❤♡How big would the samples be?♡❤♡

We expect that the particles will be of order a micron in size. (A millionth of a meter.) When people are searching using the virtual microscope, they will be looking not for the particles, but for the tracks that the particles make, which are much larger &amp;mdash; several microns in diameter. Just yesterday we switched over to a new site which has a demo of the VM (virtual microscope) I invite you to check it out. The tracks in the demo are from submicron carbonyl iron particles that were shot into aerogel using a particle accelerator modified to accelerate dust particles to very high speeds, to simulate the interstellar dust impacts that we're looking for.
♡❤♡And that's on the main Stardust@home website [see &lt;a href="%23External%20links"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;]?♡❤♡

Yes.

♡❤♡How long will the project take to complete?♡❤♡

Partly the answer depends on what you mean by "the project". The search will take several months. The bottleneck, we expect (but don't really know yet) is in the scanning &amp;mdash; we can only scan about one tile per day and there are 130 tiles in the collector…. These particles will be quite diverse, so we're hoping that we'll continue to have lots of volunteers collaborating with us on this after the initial discoveries. It may be that the 50th particle that we find will be the real Rosetta stone that turns out to be critical to our understanding of interstellar dust. So we really want to find them all! Enlarging the idea of the project a little, beyond the search, though is to actually analyze these particles. That's the whole point, obviously! 

And this is the huge advantage with this kind of a mission &amp;mdash; a "sample return" mission. 

Most missions rather do things quite differently... you have to build an instrument to make a measurement and that instrument design gets locked in several years before launch practically guaranteeing that it will be obsolete by the time you launch. Here exactly the opposite is true. Several of the instruments that are now being used to analyze the cometary dust did not exist when the mission was launched. Further, some instruments (e.g., synchrotrons) are the size of shopping malls &amp;mdash; you don't have a hope of flying these in space. So we can and will study these samples for many years. AND we have to preserve some of these dust particles for our grandchildren to analyze with their hyper-quark-gluon plasma microscopes (or whatever)!

♡❤♡When do you anticipate the project to start?♡❤♡

We're really frustrated with the delays that we've been having. Some of it has to do with learning how to deal with the aerogel collectors, which are rougher and more fractured than we expected. The good news is that they are pretty clean &amp;mdash; there is very little of the dust that you see on our training images &amp;mdash; these were deliberately left out in the lab to collect dust so that we could give people experience with the worst case we could think of. In learning how to do the scanning of the actual flight aerogel, we uncovered a couple of bugs in our scanning software &amp;mdash; which forced us to go back and rescan. Part of the other reason for the delay was that we had to learn how to handle the collector &amp;mdash; it would cost $200M to replace it if something happened to it, so we had to develop procedures to deal with it, and add several new safety features to the Cosmic Dust Lab. This all took time. Finally, we're distracted because we also have many responsibilities for the cometary analysis, which has a deadline of August 15 for finishing analysis. The IS project has no such deadline, so at times we had to delay the IS (interstellar, sorry) in order to focus on the cometary work. We are very grateful to everyone for their patience on this &amp;mdash; I mean that very sincerely. 

And rest assured that we're just as frustrated!

♡❤♡I know there will be a "test" that participants will have to take before they can examine the "real thing". What will that test consist of?♡❤♡

The test will look very similar to the training images that you can look at now. But.. there will of course be no annotation to tell you where the tracks are! 

♡❤♡Why did NASA decide to take the route of distributed computing? Will they do this again?♡❤♡

I wouldn't say that NASA decided to do this &amp;mdash; the idea for Stardust@home originated here at U. C. Berkeley. Part of the idea of course came…
♡❤♡If I understand correctly it isn't distributed computing, but distributed eyeballing?♡❤♡

…from the SETI@home people who are just down the hall from us. But as Brian just pointed out. this is not really distributed computing like SETI@home the computers are just platforms for the VM and it is human eyes and brains who are doing the real work which makes it fun (IMHO). 

That said… There have been quite a few people who have expressed interested in developing automated algorithms for searching. Just because WE don't know how to write such an algorithm doesn't mean ♡❤nobody♡❤ does. We're delighted at this and are happy to help make it happen 

♡❤♡Isn't there a catch 22 that the data you're going to collect would be a prerequisite to automating the process?♡❤♡

That was the conclusion that we came to early on &amp;mdash; that we would need some sort of training set to be able to train an algorithm. Of course you have to train people too, but we're hoping (we'll see!) that people are more flexible in recognizing things that they've never seen before and pointing them out. Our experience is that people who have never seen a track in aerogel can learn to recognize them very quickly, even against a big background of cracks, dust and other sources of confusion... Coming back to the original question &amp;mdash; although NASA didn't originate the idea, they are very generously supporting this project. It wouldn't have happened without NASA's financial support (and of course access to the Stardust collector). Did that answer the question? 

♡❤♡Will a project like this be done again?♡❤♡

I don't know... There are only a few projects for which this approach makes sense... In fact, I frankly haven't run across another at least in Space Science. But I am totally open to the idea of it. I am not in favor of just doing it as "make-work" &amp;mdash; that is just artificially taking this approach when another approach would make more sense. 

♡❤♡How did the idea come up to do this kind of project?♡❤♡ 

Really desperation. When we first thought about this we assumed that we would use some sort of automated image recognition technique. We asked some experts around here in CS and the conclusion was that the problem was somewhere between trivial and impossible, and we wouldn't know until we had some real examples to work with. So we talked with Dan Wertheimer and Dave Anderson (literally down the hall from us) about the idea of a distributed project, and they were quite encouraging. Dave proposed the VM machinery, and Josh Von Korff, a physics grad student, implemented it. (Beautifully, I think. I take no credit!) 

♡❤♡I got to meet one of the stardust directors in March during the Texas Aerospace Scholars program at JSC. She talked about searching for meteors in Antarctica, one that were unblemished by Earth conditions. Is that our best chance of finding new information on comets and asteroids? Or will more Stardust programs be our best solution?♡❤♡ 

That's a really good question. Much will depend on what we learn during this official "Preliminary Examination" period for the cometary analysis. Aerogel capture is pretty darn good, but it's not perfect and things are altered during capture in ways that we're still understanding. I think that much also depends on what question you're asking. For example, some of the most important science is done by measuring the relative abundances of isotopes in samples, and these are not affected (at least not much) by capture into aerogel. 

♡❤♡Also, she talked about how some of the agencies that they gave samples to had lost or destroyed 2-3 samples while trying to analyze them. That one, in fact, had been statically charged, and stuck to the side of the microscope lens and they spent over an hour looking for it. Is that really our biggest danger? Giving out samples as a show of good faith, and not letting NASA example all samples collected?♡❤♡

These will be the first measurements, probably, that we'll make on the interstellar dust There is always a risk of loss. Fortunately for the cometary samples there is quite a lot there, so it's not a disaster. NASA has some analytical capabilities, particularly at JSC, but the vast majority of the analytical capability in the community is not at NASA but is at universities, government labs and other institutions all over the world. I should also point out that practically every analytical technique is destructive at some level. (There are a few exceptions, but not many.) The problem with meteorites is that except in a very few cases, we don't know where they specifically came from. So having a sample that we ♡❤know♡❤ for sure is from the comet is golden! 

♡❤♡I am currently working on my Bachelor's in computer science, with a minor in astronomy. Do you see successes of programs like Stardust to open up more private space exploration positions for people such as myself. Even though I'm not in the typical "space" fields of education?♡❤♡ 

Can you elaborate on your question a little &amp;mdash; I'm not sure that I understand...

♡❤♡Well, while at JSC I learned that they mostly want Engineers, and a few science grads, and I worry that my computer science degree with not be very valuable, as the NASA rep told me only 1% of the applicants for their work study program are CS majors. I'm just curious as to your thoughts on if CS majors will be more in demand now that projects like Stardust and the Mars missions have been great successes? Have you seen a trend towards more private businesses moving in that direction, especially with President Bush's statement of Man on the Moon in 2015?♡❤♡

That's a good question. I am personally not very optimistic about the direction that NASA is going. Despite recent successes, including but not limited to Stardust, science at NASA is being decimated.

♡❤♡I made a joke with some people at the TAS event that one day SpaceShipOne will be sent up to save stranded ISS astronauts. It makes me wonder what kind of private redundancy the US government is taking for future missions.♡❤♡ 

I guess one thing to be a little cautious about is that despite SpaceShipOne's success, we haven't had an ♡❤orbital♡❤ project that has been successful in that style of private enterprise It would be nice to see that happen. I know that there's a lot of interest...! 

♡❤♡Now I know the answer to this question... but a lot do not... When samples are found, How will they be analyzed? Who gets the credit for finding the samples?♡❤♡ 

The first person who identifies an interstellar dust particle will be acknowledged on the website (and probably will be much in demand for interviews from the media!), will have the privilege of naming the particle, and will be a co-author on any papers that WE (at UCB) publish on the analysis of the particle. Also, although we are precluded from paying for travel expenses, we will invite those who discover particles AND the top performers to our lab for a hands-on tour. 

We have some fun things, including micromachines. 

♡❤♡How many people/participants do you expect to have?♡❤♡ 

About 113,000 have preregistered on our website. Frankly, I don't have a clue how many will actually volunteer and do a substantial amount of searching. We've never done this before, after all!

One last thing I want to say ... well, two. First, we are going to special efforts ♡❤not♡❤ to do any searching ourselves before we go "live". It would not be fair to all the volunteers for us to get a jumpstart on the search. ♡❤All♡❤ we are doing is looking at a few random views to make sure that the focus and illumination are good. (And we haven't seen anything &amp;mdash; no surprise at all!) Also, the attitude for this should be "Have Fun". If you're not having fun doing it, stop and do something else! A good maxim for life in general!

Two men operating a car transport ferry at &lt;a href="w%3ABerowra%20Waters%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Berowra Waters&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, North of &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; have been charged with operating a vessel with high range prescribed concentration of alcohol (PCA) according to police. The ferry crosses Berowra Creek between Bay Road and Berowra Waters Road, Berowra Waters and operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

Police met the ferry at its eastern terminal on Thursday at 7 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3ATime_in_Australia"&gt;AEST&lt;/a&gt; after receiving a report from a passenger that the boom operator appeared to be drunk. Upon the ferry's arrival, police spoke with the boom operator and conducted an on-the-spot breath test. The man returned a positive blood-alcohol reading.

Police then spoke with the ferry's captain about his boom operator. The captain was also subjected to a breath test, which returned positive.

The pair was taken to &lt;a href="w%3AHornsby%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Hornsby&lt;/a&gt; police station where they were required to undergo a further breath test. The test at the station returned a blood-alcohol reading of 0.17 for the boom operator and 0.15 for the captain. Both were more than seven times the legal limit of 0.02 for passenger vessels.

Even though the boom operator was not controlling the ferry, a person who is responsible for observing the safety of passengers is taken to have been operating the vessel under NSW law.

The pair will appear in Hornsby Local Court on a date to be set.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADuncan%20Hunter"&gt;Duncan Hunter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; member of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;United States House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from California and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Armed%20Services"&gt;House Armed Services Committee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; chairman, said Thursday that the incident involving Marines firing on unarmed &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;i civilians in the town of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHaditha"&gt;Haditha&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on 19 November 2005 will be subject to Congressional hearings as soon the criminal investigation is completed.

"If there were problems in the chain of command, if there was a cover up, if there was anything that wasn't reported, let the chips fall where they may but don't presume anything," Mr. Hunter said. 

The incident is the subject of an ongoing investigation by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANaval%20Criminal%20Investigative%20Service"&gt;Naval Criminal Investigative Service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and Multi-National Forces Iraq. No official investigation report has been released yet.

Some military commanders have said that it appears the Marines did not follow the rules of engagement. "This report is going to be ugly," one commander said.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Murtha"&gt;John Murtha&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APennsylvania"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Democrat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and member of the House of Representatives, said earlier on Wednesday that what happened near the Iraqi town of Haditha was "much worse than was reported in Time magazine". On March 21, ♡❤&lt;a href="TIME"&gt;Time&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reported that "U.S. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Marine%20Corps"&gt;Marines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; killed 15 Iraqi civilians in their homes", including "seven women and three children". ♡❤Time♡❤ also reported that U.S. troops were responding to an &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIED"&gt;IED&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and insurgent fire. 

Murtha, referring to preliminary military investigation reports, said, "There was no firefight. [...] There was no IED that killed these innocent people. Our troops over-reacted because of the pressure on them. And they killed innocent civilians in cold blood." He also said that the civilian death toll was 24 and not 15 as reported by Time magazine. 

According to the ♡❤&lt;a href="New%20York%20Times"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, Murtha stated that he himself did not read official findings of the military inquiry, but had been told about the inquiry by commanders due to his background of military service and connections to its workings.

Marine Corps &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Command"&gt;Central Command&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; spokesperson Lt. Col. Sean Gibson would neither confirm nor deny Murtha's charges.

Duncan Hunter said in response to Murtha on Friday "I don't want to see these troops who have done such a magnificent job end up being portrayed in the American media by what comes out of the Haditha investigation".

State schools Superintendent &lt;a href="w%3AJack%20O%E2%80%99Connell"&gt;Jack O’Connell&lt;/a&gt; has his lawyers working “around the clock” to prepare to ask the State Supreme Court to overturn a lower court judge’s ban on using the &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; State High School Exit Exam as a graduation requirement, he said today.

"In an effort to seek resolution of this issue as quickly as possible, I have asked my attorneys to appeal directly to the &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%20Supreme%20Court"&gt;California Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt;,” said O’Connell in a prepared statement, “They are working around the clock to prepare those papers, and we expect to file within 24 to 30 hours. This is a remarkably fast turnaround for an appeal of a ruling that was made less than a week ago." 

Most appeals of a Superior Court decision go to an appellate court first. 

Last Friday, &lt;a href="w%3AAlameda%20County"&gt;Alameda County&lt;/a&gt; Superior Court judge Robert Freedman ruled against maintaining the California High School Exit Exam as a condition of graduation for the class of 2006, saying that the law requiring high school students to pass the test is unconstitutional because economically and racially disadvantaged students weren’t offered equal educations and therefore didn’t have an equal chance to pass.

In his statement, O’Connell acknowledged that some students need more help than others, but said the test should stand, anyway: "We know that some students at some schools need extra attention to overcome challenges brought to the classroom and challenges within the schools they attend. We agree those students must have every option available to them to learn the skills on the exam. But I strongly disagree that the remedy for students still struggling to pass the exam is to simply hand them a diploma whether or not they have learned what they need to know.”

Arturo J. Gonzalez, the &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; attorney who persuaded Freedman to stop the use of the test, told reporters that Freedman had ruled correctly and that the state should give up and let the students graduate. "There is no basis for the Supreme Court to take diplomas away from 45,000 students who have passed all required courses," he said in an email exchange with the &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Logan%20Courier"&gt;James Logan Courier&lt;/a&gt;. "To do that, they would have to find that Judge Freedman abused his discretion. Given the overwhelming evidence in support of his ruling, I do not think that any of the seven justices will find an abuse of discretion." 

California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said he supported O’Connell’s bid to reinstate the test and would "put the full weight of my administration behind reinstating the California High School Exit Exam graduation requirement.”

O’Connell, who wrote the law, wants the requirement to be enforced against this year’s would-be graduates who haven’t yet passed the test and so is set to ask the State Supreme Court to immediately stay Freedman’s injunction to allow the state to withhold high school diplomas as originally planned.. At last count, the ruling affects about 47,000 California Seniors, including about 70 from James Logan High School.

“The decision came as more than 1,100 California high schools prepare for graduation ceremonies,” he said, “It created confusion and uncertainty not only for seniors in the class of 2006 but for juniors in the class of 2007.”

Cynthia O'Brien, who oversees testing at &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Logan%20High%20School"&gt;James Logan High School&lt;/a&gt;, told The Courier she wants the confusion to end. "If the Exit Exam is going to go forward, then it needs to go forward. If not, then it needs to be cancelled completely," she said last week.

"Many students now wonder whether they should enroll in summer school or plan to take a summer administration of the exit exam,” he said, “Administrators and teachers are left wondering whether students who need the extra assistance will bother to enroll. And students who should be buckling down to learn the skills they need to succeed in college or the workplace have now been told they can get a diploma whether or not they have those skills.

"It is our responsibility to all of California's children, especially our disadvantaged and minority students, to equip them with the most basic skills they will need in college, in work and in life,” said Schwarzenegger. “ Postponing the exam graduation requirement will hurt our children in the long run by depriving us of the best tool we have to measure how well schools are doing their job.”

He said he’s budgeted more money to help students pass the test: “My 2006-07 budget will add $7.7 million for three additional administration of the exam and we will also provide $65 million this year to give students at risk of failing the exam the support they need to pass it." 

The high court has 90 days to decide whether to hear O’Connell’s appeal once it’s filed, but could act more quickly if it chooses.

A missing 11-year-old girl was found safe on Thursday around 5 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3APacific_Daylight_Time"&gt;PDT&lt;/a&gt; after disappearing May 16 while riding her scooter to a local video store near the north Okanagan town of &lt;a href="w%3AArmstrong%2C%20British%20Columbia"&gt;Armstrong, British Columbia&lt;/a&gt;. Carmen Kados left home on her regular two kilometer trip to the local store around 6:45 p.m. Tuesday. She wasn't seen again after leaving the store around 7:15 p.m.

Carmen's mother called authorities and reported the young girl missing around 8:45 p.m. -- police located her scooter, a cell phone and the video she had rented in a parking lot near the store. Other possessions were found but exact details were not disclosed for investigative purposes, according to Corporal Henry Proce, spokesman for the &lt;a href="RCMP"&gt;Royal Canadian Mounted Police&lt;/a&gt;.

"The first 24 hours, the first 48 hours, are crucial and as more time elapses you become more and more fearful of a worst-case scenario," Proce said.

A wide net was cast in hopes of locating Kados -- police and as many as 65 search and rescue volunteers searched the largely rural area, scouring railroad tracks, streams, and parking lots. The girl and her alleged abductor were located separately around 5 a.m. Thursday. The suspect in the abduction was identified as a transient known to police. Police indicate that community involvement, including tips and a description of the abductor, were instrumental in locating the suspect.

Kados was brought to Vernon Jubilee Hospital, and her parents joined her there. Police reported she had been injured, but the injuries were not life threatening. Both Kados and her parents are traumatized by the incident; spokesman Proce did not expect they would be making a public statement soon.

"I think anybody that's a parent can only begin to imagine how it must feel not to know where your child is," said Proce. "This is a little 11-year-old girl and to not know where she is even for an hour, never mind 36 hours, would be something only a few of us can even imagine."

&lt;a href="Hawaii"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt; Governor &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALinda%20Lingle"&gt;Linda Lingle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wrote a letter to &lt;a href="Republican%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;Republicans&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; urging passage of the controversial Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act (S. 147), commonly known as the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAkaka%20Bill"&gt;Akaka Bill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; after Sen. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Akaka"&gt;Daniel Akaka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;D&lt;/a&gt;-Hawaii), its main proponent.

In a letter dated May 15, 2006 addressed to Senate Majority Leader &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Frist"&gt;Bill Frist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Lingle cited a recent report by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Civil%20Rights%20Commission"&gt;U.S. Civil Rights Commission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that urged defeat of the measure on the grounds that it is racially based, calling it a "misguided action" and saying that it was based on a "grossly flawed understanding of the history of Hawaii and of the law itself."

Lingle cited the fact that &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANative%20Hawaiians"&gt;Native Hawaiians&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; were governed by their own leaders prior to Western contact, and that the U.S. itself recognized Hawaii as a sovereign nation and entered into treaties with it as far back as 1826. After the overthrow of the monarchy and Hawaii's subsequent annexation in 1900, the government of the former kingdom was "subordinated to the federal government," Lingle said, asserting that Native Hawaiians' relationship to the U.S. has been political in nature rather than purely racial. She claims that this relationship was not adequately reflected in the Civil Rights Commission's report.

Opponents of the Akaka Bill have disputed the accuracy of Lingle's claims, as well as those of her Attorney General, Mark J. Bennett. They point out that throughout the Hawaiian Kingdom period, through the annexation of Hawaii and into statehood, no racial group in Hawaii ever had an exclusive government for their race alone, and that the Akaka Bill specifically creates a new government based on race, not on politics.

Attached to her letter was a three-page summary written by Hawaii Attorney General Mark Bennett, outlining the state government's criticisms of the CRC's report. Bennett said that the report reflected "a complete lack of understanding of this country's longstanding practice of dealing specially with its native peoples." Bennett also cited congressional precedent in legislation that compares the situation of Native Hawaiians to that of Native Americans. Bennett sums up the criticism by saying that there is "simply no legal or moral distinction between Native Hawaiians and American Indians or Alaska Natives, that would justify denying Native Hawaiians the same treatment other Native American groups in this country currently enjoy."

According to the Civil Rights Commission's report, a panel of experts briefed the commission on January 20, 2006; and public comment was solicited until March 21, 2006. The Commission noted that most of the comments received were in opposition to the legislation, and that while the supporters "took great pains to analogize the situation of Native Hawaiians with those of Native Americans," many of the opponents argued, "in very personal terms, that the proposed legislation would be inconsistent with basic American principles of equality, traditional Hawaiian values, and their own personal ethics."

In the end, the Commission recommended against passage of S. 147 as reported out of committee or any similar bill that "would discriminate on the basis of race or national origin and further subdivide the American people into discrete subgroups accorded varying degrees of privilege."

Two of the seven commission members reportedly rejected the conclusion and are expected to file formal dissents.

Frist had pledged to file a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acloture"&gt;cloture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; motion before the Senate to bring the measure to a vote when the body returns from May recess. Should 60 of the 100 senators approve the cloture motion, a vote would occur after a maximum of 30 hours of debate. The bill, if approved by the Senate, would still need to pass the House by the end of the year.

This interview intends to provide some insight into &lt;a href="w%3AOpenSync"&gt;OpenSync&lt;/a&gt;, an upcoming free unified data synchronization solution for free software desktops such as &lt;a href="w%3AKDE"&gt;KDE&lt;/a&gt;, commonly used as part of the &lt;a href="w%3AGNU/Linux"&gt;GNU/Linux&lt;/a&gt; operating system.

<h3>Basics</h3>
♡❤♡Hi Cornelius, Armin and Tobias. As you are now getting close to version 1.0 of OpenSync, which is expected to become the new synchronisation framework for KDE and other free desktops, we are quite interested in the merits it can provide for KDE users and for developers, as well as for the Open Source Community as a whole. So there's one key-question before I move deeper into the details of OpenSync:♡❤♡

♡❤♡What does OpenSync accomplish, that no one did before?♡❤♡

Cornelius:

♡❤♡How do the end-users profit from using synching solutions that interface with OpenSync as framework?♡❤♡

Cornelius:

♡❤♡How does OpenSync help developers with coding?♡❤♡

Cornelius:

Tobias:

♡❤♡Why should producers of portable devices get involved with your team?♡❤♡

Cornelius:

♡❤♡Do you also plan to support applications of OpenSync in proprietary systems like OSX and Windows?♡❤♡

Cornelius:

♡❤♡What does your synchronisation framework do for KDE and for KitchenSync in particular?♡❤♡

Cornelius:

<h3>Who, How and Why?</h3>

♡❤♡What was your personal reason for getting involved with OpenSync?♡❤♡

Cornelius:

Armin:

Tobias:

♡❤♡Can you tell us a bit about your further plans and ideas?♡❤♡

Cornelius:

Armin:

Tobias:

♡❤♡What was the most dire problem you had to face when creating OpenSync and how did you face it?♡❤♡

Cornelius:

Armin:

♡❤♡What was the greatest moment for you?♡❤♡

Cornelius:

Armin:

Tobias:

♡❤♡As we now know the worst problem you faced and your greatest moment, the only one missing is: What was your weirdest experience while working on OpenSync?♡❤♡

Cornelius:

Tobias:

<h3>Devices and Programs</h3>

Now I'd like to move on to some more specific questions about current and planned abilities of OpenSync. As first, I've got a personal one:

♡❤♡I have an old iPod sitting around here. Can I or will I be able to use a program utilizing OpenSync to synchronize my calendars, contacts and music to it?♡❤♡

Cornelius:

Armin:

♡❤♡Which other devices do you already support?♡❤♡

Cornelius:

♡❤♡Which programs already implement OpenSync and where can we check back to find new additions?♡❤♡

Cornelius:

Armin:

<h3>Technical Dive</h3>

It is time to give the developers something to devour, too. I'll keep this as a short twice-fold technical dive before coming to the takeoff question, even though I'm sure there's information for a double-volume book on technical subleties.

♡❤♡As first dive: How did you integrate OpenSync in KitchenSync, viewed from the coding side?♡❤♡

Cornelius:

And for the second, deeper dive:

♡❤♡Can you give us a quick outline of those inner workings of OpenSync, from the developers view, which make OpenSync especially viable for application in several different desktop environments?♡❤♡

Cornelius:

Armin:

<h3>Takeoff</h3>

To add some more spice for those of our readers, whose interest you just managed to spawn (or to skyrocket), ♡❤♡please tell us where they can get more information on the OpenSync Framework, how they can best meet and help you and how they can help improving sync-support for KDE by helping OpenSync.♡❤♡

Cornelius:

Armin:

♡❤♡Many thanks for your time!♡❤♡

Cornelius:

Armin:

Tobias:

The &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; Committee against Torture told the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; today that the US should close its detention facility at &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20Bay%20Naval%20Base"&gt;Guantanamo Bay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Cuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt; as well as disclose the existence of any secret prisons it operates. 

The committee, made up of 10 independent experts has urged the &lt;a href="w%3ABush%20administration"&gt;Bush administration&lt;/a&gt; to put a stop to the use of torture or cruel treatment during the interrogation of terror suspects.

In an 11-page report, the committee said that the US should not detain anyone in a secret facility under its control. The committee also said that the US should disclose and investigate any such facilities. It is alleged that the US has a number of secret prisons where suspects are transported to and questioned using techniques that violate international human rights conventions.

Earlier this month, the US sent 30 officials to a torture committee hearing in &lt;a href="Geneva"&gt;Geneva&lt;/a&gt;. The delegation was criticized for failing to comment on questions relating to America's alleged secret prisons.

The committee ruled that there was evidence that US military personnel in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; had violated the rights of some detainees. The committee said that some of the US' techniques had resulted in the deaths of prisoners during the interrogation process. The committee further claimed that "vague" guidelines had led to abuse of detainees.

According to the ♡❤Associated Press♡❤, John B. Bellinger III, a State Department legal advisor and participant during the hearings at Geneva, said of the recommendation to close the base that, "one, seems to be beyond their mandate; two, legally wrong to say that the existence of Guantanamo is a per se violation of the convention; and, three, a not very practical recommendation given that they say that it ought to be closed but that individuals can't be sent back to a large number of countries."

President Bush said previously on ARD German television that he wants to close the Guantanamo Bay detainment camp. According to White House spokesman Tony Snow, the President is waiting for the US Supreme Court to decide on the issue of whether military tribunals or civilian courts would try the detainees.

The 3D animated short film ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AElephants%20Dream"&gt;Elephants Dream&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, formerly known as ♡❤Project Orange♡❤, was released to the Internet yesterday. The film is available under the &lt;a href="http%3A//creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution License&lt;/a&gt;, allowing anyone to download, modify and distribute it. The 10-minute film has been called "the first open source movie" by ♡❤NewsForge♡❤. Not only is the movie itself &lt;a href="w%3Afree%20content"&gt;free content&lt;/a&gt;, even the computer files containing the 3D models used in the film are available under the same terms.

The project was first announced one year ago and was jointly produced by the Blender Foundation and the Netherlands Media Art Institute. The film tells the story of Emo and Proog, two men trapped inside a surreal machine world. Only freely available open source software was used to create the movie. Most of the work was done using &lt;a href="w%3ABlender%20%28software%29"&gt;Blender&lt;/a&gt;, a 3D modelling and rendering tool. The Blender Foundation is selling an extended edition on DVD, which includes subtitles in 34 languages, a ♡❤Making Of♡❤ documentary, commentary tracks, and all files used to create the movie.

In spite of the successful completion of the project, the Blender Foundation "has no intention to grow or expand into a company or studio" according to the project website. "Instead, the Foundation aims at endorsing and supporting activities within (educational) institutes, universities and companies."

United States

On Wednesday John Murtha, a member of the United States House of Representatives, said that the incident on November 19, 2005 near the Iraqi town of Haditha was "much worse than was reported in Time magazine". On March 21, 2006 Time magazine reported that "U.S. Marines killed 15 Iraqi civilians in their homes", including "seven women and three children". Time reported that U.S. troops were responding to an IED and insurgent fire.

India

As the dispute over a government proposal to increase the quota of University seats reserved for students from the Other Backward Castes (OBCs) continues, pro-quota demonstrators in Patna, India were baton-charged by police, apparently after the protest turned violent.
Police officials alleged that the rally organised by medical students had commenced without prior permission from the authorities.

Norway

A suggestion to translate the national anthem of Norway in a language spoken by immigrants to the country is causing controversy. Those who oppose this suggestion say that the people who cannot understand Norwegian could just hum with the Norwegian citizens. Since a week, there have been huge patriotic rallies in Norway to mark the occasion of Norwegian Constitution Day on May 17. The debate is over the suggestion to translate the Norwegian national anthem in writing to Urdu, a language spoken by many immigrants in Norway.

United States

Hawaii Governor Linda Lingle wrote a letter to Republicans in the U.S. Senate urging passage of the controversial Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act (S. 147), commonly known as the Akaka Bill after Sen. Daniel Akaka (D-Hawaii), its main proponent.
In a letter dated May 15, 2006 addressed to Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, Lingle cited a recent report by the U.S. Civil Rights Commission that urged defeat of the measure on the grounds that it is racially based, calling it a "misguided action" and saying that it was based on a "grossly flawed understanding of the history of Hawaii and of the law itself."

<h1>US General in Iraq Claims Employment can Undermine Insurgency</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=US%20General%20in%20Iraq%20Claims%20Employment%20can%20Undermine%20Insurgency&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Lt. General Peter Chiarelli, the No. 2 ranking US general in Iraq, has made the assertion that providing jobs for the Iraqi people is key to ending the insurgency and stabilizing the country.

In a video teleconference with reporters at the Pentagon he said, "by creating jobs and opportunity, the Iraqi government would take away a major source of support for violent movements -- aimless, underemployed, young men who would otherwise rather be gainfully employed and supporting their families, but are laying IEDs, shooting RPGs and fighting Iraqi security forces and the coalition because they lack alternatives…. In areas where unemployment is the highest, as I go out and talk to people in those areas, and they tell me the one thing that you can do to lower the number of insurgencies is find jobs for the people. And we're committed to help both the Iraqi government and the PRTs as they go about the business of doing exactly that."

The General also said that the insurgents were taking advantage of political disputes within the Iraqi leadership as they are attempting to form an inclusive government.

Chiarelli's assertion is similar to a claim made by Lt. General John R. Vines in 2005 that insurgents often attack US forces out of a desire to earn money instead of ideology. Simple tasks, such as placing a bomb or mine, are often done in exchange for amounts as little as $100 to $150.

The estimated unemployment rate in Iraq for 2005 was 25-30%. 

Opponents of the Bush administration's handling of the war say that Iraq's unemployment crisis is partially a result of decisions made by the Coalition Provisional Authority in 2003 to disband the Iraqi army and purge the Iraqi civil service of high-ranking members of the Baath Party. Both of these moves led to an estimated 500,000 Iraqis losing their jobs, about one out of every ten Iraqi workers at the time.

According to the &lt;a href="w%3AUSGS"&gt;United States Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt; (USGS), a strong magnitude 6.1 earthquake has been reported beneath the &lt;a href="w%3AMolucca%20Sea"&gt;Molucca Sea&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; at approximately 10:44 p.m. local time and hit approximately 120 miles off the country's Sulawesi Island.

The quake was recorded at 34 miles beneath the Earth's surface and there are no immediate reports of damage to buildings or injuries.

According to Dailin Wang of the Tsunami Warning Center in &lt;a href="w%3AEwa%20Beach%2C%20Hawaii"&gt;Ewa Beach, Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;, the quake was not powerful enough and did not require a &lt;a href="w%3Atsunami"&gt;tsunami&lt;/a&gt; warning to be issued.

In January, a magnitude 7.7 quake was reported beneath the &lt;a href="w%3ABanda%20Sea"&gt;Banda Sea&lt;/a&gt; 195 k.m. south of Ambon City. No tsunami was reported and no one was injured, but there were reports of some damage to buildings.

New television stars in Australia, the &lt;a href="w%3ARAGGS%20Kids%20Club%20Band"&gt;RAGGS Kids Club Band&lt;/a&gt; started as simply a mall touring promotion.

Airing on Australia's Seven Network weekdays at 9:00 am, the series features new songs, animated segments, and "letters from friends", as well as the music videos and concert scenes that the DVD releases focused on. Another noticeable change is the design of the costumed characters that star in the series, which now have larger heads, besides many other modifications.

Characters in the series include original members RAGGS, Trilby, Fido, B. Max (B. Maxwell Oliver) and Razzles. New to the series is Dumpster, an opinionated cat. The stars live together in a home, and learn to develop positive relationships with each other.

More concerts for the show will be filmed in September 2006. Producers are inviting fans to contact them, to be notified when the open tapings happen.

Created by RAGGS LLC Production, the series is co-produced with Southern Star Entertainment Pty Limited. RAGGS was created by former advertising executive Toni Steedman, who now manages RAGGS LLC full-time. Beginning as a promotional company managing mall's kids clubs, RAGGS expanded to a touring show, released CDS, a DVD, and a line of merchandise. The series' creator plans to have the show on the air in the United States, within the next few months. Sixty-five episodes were produced.

This certainly isn't the first time a fictional band has had a television series. &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Archies"&gt;The Archies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJosie%20and%20the%20Pussycats"&gt;Josie and the Pussycats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Banana%20Splits"&gt;The Banana Splits&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AAlvin%20and%20the%20Chipmunks"&gt;Alvin and the Chipmunks&lt;/a&gt; are all notable examples.

According to psychologists in &lt;a href="w%3ALeipzig%2C%20Germany"&gt;Leipzig, Germany&lt;/a&gt;, apes and some birds are able to plan their actions ahead of time.

Psychologists Nicholas Mulcahy and Josep Call at Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology say that apes are able to save tools to use at a later time, that will assist them in retrieving food. 

The results of the testing are "groundbreaking" and is "a starting point from which we can begin to reconstruct the evolution of the human mind. Apes and jays can also anticipate future needs by remembering past events, contradicting the notion that such cognitive behavior only emerged in hominids," said Thomas Suddendorf, a psychologist at the University of Queensland Brisbane, Australia.

One aspect of the study is that "our extraordinary abilities of planning for the future did not evolve entirely de novo. Planning for future needs is not uniquely human," added Suddendorf.

An experiment was performed using &lt;a href="w%3Abonobo"&gt;bonobo&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href="w%3Aorangutan"&gt;orangutan&lt;/a&gt;s. The psychologists placed the apes alone in a room for five minutes. Each of them had a choice of two tools that would allow them to retrieve food and six that would not. The apes were allowed to look at and observe the tools; however, they were not allowed to handle them. 

The apes were then taken to a room next door, allowed to take whatever tools they chose, and left alone in the room for at least one hour, while a researcher removed all other tools from the first room. The apes then returned to the first room (where the food was), but the food was not accessible unless they had the right tool to retrieve it. 

After repeating the same test several times with each ape, researchers began to see that most apes would begin to use the right tool for the job. Researchers also received similar results even when the apes were left alone in a room overnight where they would sleep.

To make sure that the apes were not associating the tools with the food, they removed the food from the room, but would still give it to the apes if they used the right tool to retrieve it. After this change, most of them did not bring the proper tools, which researchers say confirm that the retrieval is a way of planning for the job.

In experiments using &lt;a href="w%3Ajays"&gt;scrub jays&lt;/a&gt; (found mostly in the western &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;), at the University of Cambridge in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, psychologists have shown that the birds, who usually hide their food to eat later, will hide it again if an enemy bird saw them do it the first time, unless the bird is dominant. The subordinate jay could however, fight the other for the food.

"These results suggest scrub jays remember who observed them make specific caches," said Joanna Dally who was involved in the study with the scrub jays.

"Together with recent evidence from scrub jays, our results suggest that future planning is not a uniquely human ability, thus contradicting the notion that it emerged in hominids only with the past 2.5 to 1.6 million years," said Mulcahy and Call in the study.

On Friday in &lt;a href="w%3ACape%20Canaveral%2C%20Florida"&gt;Cape Canaveral, Florida&lt;/a&gt;, Space Shuttle Discovery began its 4.2 mile, 7 hour long journey to the launch pad, completing successfully. Discovery weighs approximately 4.5 million pounds.

The launch was supposed to occur in May, but &lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; pushed back the date because of a faulty fuel sensor.

This will be Discovery's second mission since the space shuttle Columbia broke apart during re-entry in 2003. Engineers believed that foam falling from the shuttle and smashing into the wing caused the disaster. After the accident, NASA grounded the shuttle fleet to determine the cause.

In 2005 cameras had shown during launch that a piece of foam being shed from the external tank, as well as smaller tile and foam dings. NASA and the crew decided that mission specialist Stephen Robinson should attempt to pull out the protruding gap fillers. Cameras also detected a small piece of thermal blanket near the cockpit that fell off, but later tests in wind tunnels had shown the piece to be of little concern and Discover landed safely.

NASA is scheduling the launch for Discovery to be between July 1 and July 19, 2006 and Steve Lindsey will Commander of the mission, flying with pilot Mark Kelly, two spacewalkers, Mike Fossum and Piers Sellers and mission specialists Stephanie Wilson and Lisa Nowak. &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Space%20Agency"&gt;European Space Agency&lt;/a&gt; (ESA) astronaut Thomas Reiter is also part of the crew but he will remain on the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Space%20Station"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt; (ISS) for several months.

The match started with both sides being lead out by regular field players, as opposed to the traditional captains leading out their respective sides. &lt;a href="w%3AGreg%20Sommerville"&gt;Greg Sommerville&lt;/a&gt; lead out the Crusaders, in honour of his 100th match for the side, while &lt;a href="w%3ABakkies%20Botha"&gt;Bakkies Botha&lt;/a&gt; lead out the Bulls in recognition of his 50th match milestone.

The Bulls were on the back foot immediately after &lt;a href="w%3AFourie%20du%20Preez"&gt;Fourie du Preez&lt;/a&gt; knocked on a &lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Carter%20%28rugby%20player%29"&gt;Daniel Carter&lt;/a&gt; kick. The Bulls also failed to capitalize early on, with &lt;a href="w%3AMorn%C3%A9%20Steyn"&gt;Morné Steyn&lt;/a&gt; missing a 35 m penalty kick straight in front in the 7th minute.

The scoring opened up in the 16th minute, with &lt;a href="w%3AAll%20Black"&gt;All Black&lt;/a&gt; flyhalf and 2005 IRB World player of the year &lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Carter%20%28rugby%20player%29"&gt;Daniel Carter&lt;/a&gt; kicking a penalty for the Crusaders, as well as taking his own season tally to 200 points.

After a &lt;a href="w%3ALeon%20MacDonald"&gt;Leon MacDonald&lt;/a&gt; chip kick, which he managed to regather, the Crusaders were able to produce quick ruck ball which ended with a grubber by centre &lt;a href="w%3ACasey%20Laulala"&gt;Casey Laulala&lt;/a&gt; for winger &lt;a href="w%3ARico%20Gear"&gt;Rico Gear&lt;/a&gt; to run on to and place down for the first try of the match. Carter subsequently missed the resulting conversion.

The Bulls' first points came in the 29th minute with Steyn kicking a 40m penalty to put three points on the board for the South African team. However, nearly straight after the kickoff, the Crusaders forced a turn over and again were able to produce quick ruck ball for Laulala to put away Gear for his second try of the night. Carter missed the conversion, which was in a similar position to the first.

Carter was then able to lengthen the Crusaders' lead with a &lt;a href="w%3Adropped%20goal"&gt;dropped goal&lt;/a&gt; 35m out. After some good mauling, &lt;a href="w%3ASpringboks"&gt;Springboks'&lt;/a&gt; winger &lt;a href="w%3ABryan%20Habana"&gt;Bryan Habana&lt;/a&gt; was able to score a try for the Bulls in the corner just before the stroke of halftime. Steyn missed the conversion, leaving the score 16&amp;ndash;8 in favour of the Crusaders at half time.

In the second half, the Crusaders scored a try through lock &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Jack"&gt;Chris Jack&lt;/a&gt; after 17 phases, most of which consisted of pick and goes. This drew the Bulls fowards in and allowed half back Andrew Ellis to pass out to Jack who scored. Carter kicked the conversion to make it 23&amp;ndash;8.

Four minutes into the second half, promising young scrum half Andrew Ellis went down with what appeared to be an injury to his right knee. He was ably replace by All Black scrum half Kevin Senio. Three minutes later, Habana went down with a leg injury. This could be potentially devastating news for Springboks coach Jake White. Reserve scrum half Senio later went off to the blood-bin, forcing Cameron McIntyre on. Carter then switched into scrum half until Senio returned for McIntyre.

After the Bulls managed to control the ball for the next 20 minutes, the Crusaders forced a turn over. Fullback MacDonald was able to place a grubber into the corner, going out off a Bulls player. Some quick thinking by &lt;a href="w%3AAaron%20Mauger"&gt;Aaron Mauger&lt;/a&gt; to throw the ball in quickly resulted in try to hooker Corey Flynn, which is his second in two weeks. Carter missed the subsequent coversion.

Mauger was again involved in the action later, this time scoring himself an impressive try in the 67th minute. After receiving a high pass from Carter, Mauger ran 51 m to score, beating 4 tacklers in the process and scoring the try in the 5th tackle. Carter converted and in doing so eclipsed &lt;a href="w%3AAndrew%20Mehrtens"&gt;Andrew Mehrten's&lt;/a&gt; record of 206 points in a season.

Late in the game, &lt;a href="w%3APierre%20Spies"&gt;Pierre Spies&lt;/a&gt; scored a consolation try after quick ruck ball and breaking a Senio tackle. Steyn converted. This left it a 35&amp;ndash;15, the final score.

After the match, Bulls captain &lt;a href="w%3AVictor%20Matfield"&gt;Victor Matfield&lt;/a&gt; praised the Crusaders: "They punished us like they always do".

The Bulls loss continues their poor run at Jade Stadium, having won only once, back in 1996. In fact, the Crusaders have not lost at Jade since round 2, 2004. It also continued the run of New Zealand teams - no New Zealand team has lost to a South African team in a semi.

The Crusaders started the match as large favourites, paying $1.07 compared to the Bulls $7.00.

The final will be held at 7:35 p.m., Saturday, May 27 at Jade Stadium. It is the fourth all New Zealand final in 11 seasons of super rugby. It is expected to be a sell out.

<h1>Riot at Guantanamo Bay detention camp</h1>

Inmates at &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo_Bay_detention_camp"&gt;Guantanamo Bay detention camp&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Cuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt; have attacked guards with fan blades and other makeshift weapons. Rear Admiral Harry Harris, the commander of &lt;a href="w%3AJoint_Task_Force_Guantanamo"&gt;Joint Task Force Guantanamo&lt;/a&gt; says some detainees were injured in "the most violent outbreak" at the facility since it was opened in 2002.

Officers fired rubber bullets at the detainees after the guards were attacked with "broken light fixtures, fan blades" and other improvised weapons. Rear Admiral Harris says, "minimum force was used to quell the disturbance".

The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Times"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; reports that a riot-control unit with batons and shields quelled Thursday’s disturbance. Another episode involved two other groups of inmates who tore apart their quarters and attacked guards.

Military officials said the detainees' actions were designed to draw attention to the plight of the terror suspects detained indefinitely in "Gitmo". Rear Admiral Harris, said that a prisoner was pretending to hang himself to lure the guards into the room. "The detainees had slickened the floor of their block with faeces, urine and soapy water in an attempt to trick the guards," he said. "They then assaulted the guards with broken light fixtures, fan blades and bits of metal."

The guards used pepper spray and blasted the detainees with several shots from a shotgun, firing rubber balls during the five-minute fight. No guards were hurt, but six inmates were treated for "minor injuries," he said.

Colonel Mike Bumgarner said guards shot five rounds of &lt;a href="w%3ARubber_bullet"&gt;"nonlethal"&lt;/a&gt; pellets from a 12-gauge shotgun, and a rubber grenade from an M-203 launcher. He said rioting then broke out in two other blocks of Camp Four when around 50 detainees damaged their quarters and made weapons to attack the guards. Colonel Bumgarner said it took an hour to bring the disturbances under control. He says the six detainees received minor injuries.

A military spokesman said 60 of the detainees were later transferred to more secure areas of the camp. Colonel Bumgarner says "detainees were jumping out of the beds on top of the guards" and some guards were knocked to the floor. "Frankly we were losing the fight at that point," he said. "This illustrates to me the dangerous nature of the men we have detained here," Rear Admiral Harris told reporters in a teleconference.

Earlier in the day, two other detainees attempted suicide by overdosing on hoarded prescription drugs. Guantanamo officials said there have been 41 suicide attempts by 25 detainees and no deaths since the camp opened in January 2002. Defense lawyers contend the figure is higher.

Meanwhile, the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Committee%20Against%20Torture"&gt;United Nations Committee Against Torture&lt;/a&gt; has called on the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; to shut down Guantanamo and close any other "secret prisons" it operates. The UN declared the indefinite detention of suspects without charge a "violation of the UN Convention Against Torture."

"The State party should cease to detain any person at Guantanamo Bay and close this detention facility, permit access by the detainees to judicial process or release them as soon as possible," the committee said. They called on the US to "ensure that no one is detained in any secret detention facility under its de facto effective control".

<h1>Australian PM pushes for &quot;full-blooded&quot; nuclear energy debate</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Australian%20PM%20pushes%20for%20%26quot%3Bfull-blooded%26quot%3B%20nuclear%20energy%20debate&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
Australian Prime Minister John Howard has told media in Canada that he wants "a full-blooded debate" in Australia about the issue of nuclear power. "I have a very open mind on the development of nuclear energy in my own country," he said. "That includes an open mind on whether or not Australia should in fact process uranium for the purposes of providing fuel for nuclear power in the future in Australia." 

Australia and Canada are two of the world's largest uranium producers, and the nuclear energy issue was discussed at length during Prime Minister Howard's visit to the country this week. Mr Howard said soaring oil prices and environmental concerns from fossil-fuel energy are adding pressure towards the debate in Australia. "I think it is inevitable. The time at which it will come should be governed by economic considerations," Mr Howard said from Ottawa.

Australian Greens leader Senator Bob Brown labelled the Prime Minister's call "a sham". Senator Brown says the Prime Minister has already made up his mind. "His talk about a public debate is a complete sham, he's made up his mind," he said. "He's had no mandate, but he's got control of the Senate and therefore we are going headlong into becoming a major agent in the nuclear proliferation right around the world."

Scientists have said Australia could not develop a nuclear power industry in time to stave off the effects of climate change. Greenpeace Australia says that even if there was a doubling of nuclear energy by 2050 it would only reduce greenhouse gas emissions by five percent, well below the large cuts scientists say are necessary. Academics at NSW University and the University of Technology Sydney have said, "No private investor would take on the risk without huge government subsidies." 

The NSW Greens MLC Ian Cohen said that after 50 years, the nuclear industry still had not found a way to store its waste safely. "We don't want it back and we don't want to create it here."

Steve Shallhorn, chief executive of Greenpeace Australia Pacific says the Prime Minister should have used his trip to Canada to learn why "nuclear power is not a viable option." Mr Shallhorn said that, in Canada, nuclear power has driven up the price of electricity and created dangerous amounts of waste. He says its effect in reducing greenhouse gas emissions is also negligible.

"Nuclear power can only solve a very tiny portion of greenhouse gas problems because electricity is only one source of the problem," said Mr Shallhorn. "Nuclear power is not going to solve emissions from aircraft, from the industrial sector or from industrial processes."

"I think it is inevitable. The time at which it will come should be governed by economic considerations," Mr Howard said from Ottawa.

Australia is one of the world's top coal producers. The Howard government has supported the coal industry in the face of calls for more renewable energy. Treasurer Peter Costello, next-in-line for the prime minister's job, has said "nuclear power would cost twice as much as coal power, adding that nuclear energy was not economically right for Australia at the present time because it had such large resources of gas and coal."

John Howard said nuclear power in Australia "could be closer than some people would have thought a short while ago." Federal Industry Minister, Ian Macfarlane, claimed it could be as early as 2020.

The Opposition's environment spokesman, &lt;a href="Anthony%20Albanese"&gt;Anthony Albanese&lt;/a&gt;, said Labor opposed nuclear power on cost, safety, and waste and proliferation grounds. "Labor will not change that view." He said he looks forward to "Labor ending John Howard's nuclear fantasy." Energy experts say that Australia could not develop a nuclear power industry in time to stave off the effects of climate change, and such a program would be prohibitively expensive. 

A 2005 survey found 47 percent of Australians supported nuclear power and 40 percent opposed it. The federal opposition party, and all six state governments, oppose nuclear power. Australia has a strict "no new mines" uranium policy.

The film, directed by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARon%20Howard"&gt;Ron Howard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , is an adaptation of the novel of the same name by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADan%20Brown"&gt;Dan Brown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which has sold over 60 million copies worldwide. Officials at Sony-owned &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AColumbia%20Pictures"&gt;Columbia Pictures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which distributed the film, expect the film to gross &lt;a href="US%24"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;50 million to US$80 million during its first weekend in the United States, based on figures from early matinees on Friday. "The early matinees are very strong and extremely encouraging," said Steve Elzer, a spokesman for Columbia.

Outside the United States, the film is also proving controversial, as long lines formed outside theatres in China, while the movie's release has been postponed indefinitely in India and banned outright in the Philippine capital of Manila.

"The Da Vinci Code" stars &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Hanks"&gt;Tom Hanks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAudrey%20Tautou"&gt;Audrey Tautou&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who respectively play a Harvard professor on religious symbols and a French cryptologist who become involved in a murder mystery revolving around the works of Leonardo da Vinci, a secret that could rock the foundations of the &lt;a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church"&gt;Roman Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt; if revealed, and a society formed to protect that secret.

The film was previewed at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACannes%20film%20festival"&gt;Cannes film festival&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to mixed reviews, and critics have generally given the film a cool reception.

Certain thematic elements in the film and novel have caused a religious backlash, as Catholic officials call the movie blasphemous. "'The Da Vinci Code' gratuitously insults Jesus Christ and the Catholic Church," said Vincent Nichols, the Roman Catholic archbishop of &lt;a href="Birmingham"&gt;Birmingham&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;. "It deliberately presents fiction as fact."

The Catholic Church in China called on its followers to boycott the film, while a Catholic lay group in the United States plan is planning rallies outside 1,000 theatres nationwide. Francis Slobodnik, who is coordinating the campaign for the Pennsylvania-based group, called the film "an insult directed towards God."

Two Christchurch hospitals, Christchurch Hospital and Princess Margaret Hospital, have had an outbreak of norovirus.

A special isolation ward in the Christchurch Hospital has been setup for 20 patients and 12 staff, who have contracted the disease.
Princess Margaret Hospital has also setup similar conditions.

Norovirus causes severe vomiting and diarrhoea. People who get this disease usually recover within 48 hours.

It is possible to get this disease from infected's vomit or feaces, contact with the sick, eating infected food, or touching infected surfaces.

Visitors are urged to stay away from wards 23 and 29, where the outbreak occurred, unless it is absolutely necessary.

This happened in 2004, as well, when 200 patients and staff got the disease.

Update:
He has just been offered $4000. This was done through the New Zealand radio station, ZM which gave him $20,000 of advertising after he spoke on their station, Friday.

Original Story
Nelson man Shane Torrance is trying to sell his leg that got amputated because of diabeties for $3000 (NZD) to help his daughter, who also has diabetes.

He posted it on TradeMe (http://www.trademe.co.nz) but it was removed within a couple of hours of it first appearing online.
It is against TradeMe's terms and conditions to buy and sell body parts on their website.

Shane Torrance could also be charged for trying to sell his amputated leg under the Crimes Act or the Human Tissues Act.

He said he kept it because "I'd had it for 42 years".

The has announced the completion of an enormous dam across the &lt;a href="w%3AYangtze%20River"&gt;Yangtze River&lt;/a&gt;, an important milestone for the world's largest hydroelectric project. The official Xinhua News Agency reports the event as a "landmark in the construction of the project." 

Launched in 1993, the &lt;a href="w%3AThree%20Gorges%20Dam"&gt;Three Gorges Project&lt;/a&gt;, including the 2,300 metre long, 185 metre high dam with 26 power generators, is being built in three phases on the middle reaches of the Yangtze River - China's longest river. Built with over 16 million m of concrete, the Three Gorges Dam is considered the biggest reinforced concrete dam in the world. 

The Three Gorges Reservoir is capable of holding nearly 40 billion m of water, including a space of 22.15 billion m for extra flooded water. With a length of more than 6,300 km and a natural fall of 5,400 metres from the west to the east, the flood-prone Yangtze River is the third largest in the world.

The gigantic project is expected to generate around 15 million megawatts of electricity, 84.7 billion kWh annually when the entire project is completed in 2008. But whilst proponents of the world's largest hydropower project laud the increased electricity generation and improved flood control as benefits to China, opponents claim destruction of the environment, ruin to China's cultural heritage - disaffecting millions of local residents.

"In my view, building the Three Gorges dam is a ridiculous and evil farce," says dam opponent Dai Qing. "Many people have known something is wrong with the project, but few have dared to speak up," she said. After it becomes operational, the 660km reservoir created by the dam will drown 13 towns, 4500 villages and 162 archaeological sites. 

&lt;a href="w%3AFriends%20of%20the%20Earth"&gt;Friends of the Earth&lt;/a&gt; (FoE) are also strident vocal critics. "The dam is having a titanic social and environment impact," the group said this week. "Sometimes people are being moved out by truncheon and bulldozer because they refuse to leave their home for fear of not being rehoused. &lt;a href="Human%20rights"&gt;Human rights&lt;/a&gt; violations are massive and brutal," it said. FoE pointed to evidence that the dam was already having a serious environment impact.

FoE points to a scientific study by the East China Normal University in &lt;a href="w%3AShanghai"&gt;Shanghai&lt;/a&gt;, published in March in Geophysical Research, which said that in 2004, the Three Gorges dam has reduced the supply of sediment to the Yangtze delta to just 35 per cent of the norm.

Millions of tonnes of silt are drawn along the Yangtze river every year, and critics argue the dam will intercept much of it - with potentially disastrous consequences. They say the lack of sediment further downstream would lead to soil erosion, and the accumulation of sediment in the reservoir could raise the dam level, submerging even more land. 

Opponents say the reservoir could fill with the accumulated garbage from tens of millions of households. The China Yangtze River Three Gorges Project Development Corp. has spent $2.5 million on a vessel to collect as much as 7 million cubic feet of garbage that accumulates at the dam each year, according to Xinhua. Some argue that the impact of the dam project will contribute to the extinction of the rare Yangtze river dolphin. 

The dam project will force the relocation of a total of 1.13 million people, and communities that have lived in the area for millennia will disappear. Researchers warn sedimentation and rising water levels in the reservoir will lead to the evacuation of tens of thousands more people.

But as the waters rise, that which can not be saved will disappear along with some world famous natural scenery. Critics say the dam is under threat from earthquakes, with two geological fault lines nearby. Officials working on the project counter this by saying the worst that can happen is a tremor measuring 6.0 on the Richter scale, while the dam is built to withstand force 7.0.

"Although the dam is now complete, we still have a long way to go and cannot become self-satisfied or relax our efforts in the least," Li Yongan, general manager of the Three Gorges Project Development Corp, said. The official China Daily in an editorial called for people to remember the more than 100 workers whom died during the dam's construction. "The best possible way to repay such a debt of gratitude is to make sure the highest safety and quality standards are observed up till the very end of the entire building process," the editorial said.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; Roads and Traffic Authority announced Friday night that a &lt;a href="w%3AAUD"&gt;AUD&lt;/a&gt;$1.20 toll will be charged on a pair of new 200 metre long on and off ramps from the &lt;a href="w%3AWarringah%20Freeway"&gt;Warringah Freeway&lt;/a&gt; to Falcon Street, &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Sydney"&gt;North Sydney&lt;/a&gt;.

According to the RTA the ramps are part of the &lt;a href="w%3ALane%20Cove%20Tunnel"&gt;Lane Cove Tunnel&lt;/a&gt; project. The new ramps are being constructed so that traffic can enter and leave Falcon Street from the Northern side of the Warringah Freeway. At present, there are only on and off ramps on the Southern side of the intersection.

The Southern ramps will remain toll-free.

According to the RTA, the toll was set at $1.00 in 1999. Inflation has been applied to that value to bring it to the $1.20 that will be charged when the ramps open. Heavy vehicles will pay $2.40 to use the ramps, although commercial buses will not be tolled.

As with all of Sydney's newest toll roads, tolls will be collected electronically.

Neither NSW Premier Morris Iemma nor transport minister Eric Roozendaal has commented on the tolling arrangements for the ramps.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Democrats"&gt;Australian Democrats&lt;/a&gt; founder, &lt;a href="w%3ADon%20Chipp"&gt;Don Chipp&lt;/a&gt; has told patrons at the party's national conference in &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; that "the party is not only in a low position in the public esteem but it seems to be in a continuous downward spiral". Chipp helped found the party in 1977 after becoming discontent with the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt;.

Mr Chipp told patrons at the conference that the party has suffered recently due to public personality clashes and a lack of unity and that the 2007 election would determine the party's future.

Mr Chipp said that the party had deteriorated over the past few years and that the party could have capitalised on public dissatisfaction with both the government and opposition, which he says is at its highest level in 30 years. "Why has this wonderful creation … deteriorated to such an extent that almost all political commentators forecast its death at the election to be held next year," he said.

"The voters' disgust and resentment of the two major parties is infinitely greater than 30 years ago." Mr Chipp told the conference.

The party has been in steady political decline since 1998. Under the Senate electoral system in Australia, at each general election only half the Senate is elected. At the 2004 election, no Democrats were elected, leaving only the four members elected in 2001 and the lowest number of Democrat members since 1977.

Mr Chipp urged the party to embrace change. He said that those who do not believe they could successfully contest their seat at the next election or who were considering retiring from politics should "resign immediately".

"Perhaps all the current senators should ask themselves if they think they can personally retain their seat at the next election," he said. 

"If they believe they cannot win, or if they decide they will not stand for the next re-election, they should give consideration to resigning from the Senate immediately," said Mr Chipp.

"The Democrats are a fragile institution with few members and limited resources, (and) one must ask, 'Is it moral that a senator be allowed to sit out their term in comfort while the party disintegrates around them?'" Mr Chipp said.

<h1>US Navy sailors jailed in Australia on drug smuggling charges</h1>

Two sailors from the ship &lt;a href="w%3AUSS%20Boxer%20%28LHD-4%29"&gt;USS Boxer&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; man living on &lt;a href="w%3AQueensland"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt;'s Gold Coast have been sentenced to jail for bringing seven kilos of the drug commonly known as 'ice' (&lt;a href="w%3Amethamphetamine"&gt;methamphetamine&lt;/a&gt;), valued at about &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20dollar"&gt;A$&lt;/a&gt;1 million, into &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; in June last year.

A court in Townsville, Queensland heard that seven kilograms of methamphetamine were hidden in the radar compartment of the USS Boxer. ABC radio reported that the drugs were taken ashore by sailor Andrew Labanon and handed to Chief Petty Officer Daniel Maio at a Townsville motel. Maio had arranged to pay Labanon $10,000 to bring the drugs ashore when the Boxer was visiting Townsville. Maio and a third man, Iranian-born Canadian Mehdi Mohammadi, attempted to travel to the Gold Coast before Australian police arrested them. 

Maio, changed his plea to guilty during the trial, and was sentenced to 12-and-a-half years in jail, with a non-parole period of six years. Judge Kerry Cullinane sentenced Labanon to six years jail, He was ordered to serve at least three years before being eligible for parole. Mohammadi was given a sentence of 14 years, with a minimum non-parole period of seven years.

A task force of more than 20 undercover federal police agents intercepted the drug smuggling operation last June. &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Federal%20Police"&gt;Australian Federal Police&lt;/a&gt; (AFP) welcomed the jail terms. AFP spokesman Jason Byrnes said: "We've taken almost seven kilos of ice off Australian streets..." 

He said the Australian police were "very satisfied with the three convictions and this was another great example of federal police with Customs' support targeting main offenders of drug crime against Australia and Australians."

An explosion in a coal mine in eastern &lt;a href="w%3AKentucky"&gt;Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;, located in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, killed 5 miners. One miner was able to walk out of the mine. The explosion occurred at Darby Mine No. 1, owned by Kentucky Darby LLC and located in &lt;a href="w%3AHarlan%20County%2C%20Kentucky"&gt;Harlan County&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AMine%20Safety%20and%20Health%20Administration"&gt;Federal Mine Safety officials&lt;/a&gt; say the explosion happened sometime between midnight and 1 a.m. local time Saturday.

According to Kentucky Governor &lt;a href="w%3AErnie%20Fletcher"&gt;Ernie Fletcher&lt;/a&gt;, they "don't know the details of the cause," of the explosion.

The miners were part of a maintenance crew that was on duty during the time of the explosion. It is not known how many miners were inside the mine when the explosion happened; however, no mining was in progress when the explosion occurred.

Rescue crews are on scene. The names of the miners are not known.

The law issues have been actualized since 14 coal miners been killed in West Virginia in two accidents last January. A Senate committee endorsed bill would make coal mining safer by requiring miners to have at least two hours of oxygen available instead of one. Mine operators would also be required to keep extra oxygen packs accessible along escape ways in the mine. A temporary rule by the Mine Safety and Health Administration requiring coal operators to give miners extra oxygen was earlier issued but miners pressed Congress for a permanent legislation.

Scoring opened just after three minutes, when Biarritz winger &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASireli%20Bobo"&gt;Sireli Bobo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; scored a try down the left sideline. The try, which came in centimetres of the touchline, was converted from the sideline by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADimitri%20Yachvili"&gt;Dimitri Yachvili&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , taking Biarritz to seven points to nil. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARonan%20O%27Gara"&gt;Ronan O'Gara&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; landed a penalty in the 7th minute, putting three points on the board for Munster. Biarritz held out a Munsters for eight minutes, before taking the ball in their own in-goal area to take the ball to their 22. Munster regathered the ball, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATrevor%20Halstead"&gt;Trevor Halstead&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; planted the ball down on the left corner to scored Munster's first try. O'Gara converted the try, taking Munster to the front, leading 10 points to seven, 18 minutes in.

A penalty on Munster's tryline in the 21st minute saw Biarritz go for a penalty kick. The kick, just left to the posts was converted by Yachvili, taking the game to 10 points all. Biarritz kept the pressure on Munster, coming close to scoring another try in the 27th minute. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Stringer"&gt;Peter Stringer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; dashed from a Munster scrum on the Biarritz try line to score a try. O'Gara converted the kick, putting Munster at 17 points to 10. Biarritz kicked the ball out on the 40th minute, taking the game into halftime.

Munster opened the scoring in the second half, with O'Gara slotting a penalty goal two minutes in, taking Munster 10 points in front of Biarritz, leading 20 points to 10. A penalty went to Biarritz in the 47th minute, with Biarritz opting for a kick. Yachvili was successful with the kick, giving Biarritz three points, taking the game to 20 to 13 to Munster. Less than three minutes later, Yachvili slotted another penalty goal over, taking Biarritz within four points of Munster, who lead 20 to 16 after the goal.

The scoring tightened for the following 10 minutes, until Biarritz was awarded a penalty in the 69th minute. Yachvili landed the penalty kick, putting Biarritz just one point behind Munster, the score now being 20 to 19 with 10 minutes remaining.

Kentucky Derby winner Barbaro, sent as the post-time odds-on favorite in this year's Preakness Stakes at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland, breaks down in the opening stretch of the race, shattering any chance of a Triple Crown winner this year. Bernardini, the 12-1 4th choice out of 9, ends up winning this year's Preakness, stopping the clock at 1:54.65. Following up 5 1/4 lengths behind was Sweetnorthernsaint, sent to the post at 8-1, and Hemingway's Key at 29-1, six lengths further back.

According to Dr. Larry Bramlage, the on-call veterinarian for the American Association of Equine Practitioners, Barbaro's injury was "significant" and "would require major stabilizing surgery." Barbaro's injury effectively ended the horse's racing career.

Bernardini, a colt by A.P. Indy out of Cara Rafaela, by Quiet American, was bred and is owned by the Darley Stable of Sheikh Mohammed, is trained by Tom Albertrani, and was ridden to victory by Javier Castellano. Today's Preakness marks the first Preakness win for jockey Javier Castellano, who previously rode Ghostzapper to a win in the 2004 Breeders' Cup Classic. The Preakness was only Bernardini's 4th career start.

Bernardini paid $27.80 on a $2 win bet. The $2 Exacta of Bernardini and Sweetnorthernsaint (8-7) paid $171.60, the $1 Trifecta with Hemingway's Key in third (8-7-3) paid $1,956.40, and the $1 Superfecta with 2nd-favorite Brother Derek (8-7-3-6) paid $11,151.20.

Detectives from &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; have successfully extradited a 30-year-old woman and 23-year-old man from &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20Australia"&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt; wanted in connection with a double murder in the &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; suburb of &lt;a href="w%3AGranville%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Granville&lt;/a&gt; on March 29, 2006.

The victims of the murders were 26-year-old Bassam Chami, who died at the scene, and 25-year-old Ibrahim Assad, who died following surgery at Westmead Hospital.

Following the shootings, NSW Police setup a strike force, called Lasswade to investigate the murders.

The woman was arrested by detectives of the Major Crime Squad in Western Australia at 9 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3ATime_in_Australia"&gt;AEST&lt;/a&gt; last Tuesday. She was found and arrested at a motel in Victoria Park, Perth.

Shortly after the woman's arrest, the man was arrested by the Tactical Response Group as he exited a unit in East Victoria Park.

On Wednesday, four members of Strike Force Lasswade flew to Perth and was successful in applying to have the pair extradited to NSW to face questioning and charges. The pair arrived in Sydney on Saturday night.

Once in NSW, police took the pair to &lt;a href="w%3ASurry%20Hills%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Surry Hills&lt;/a&gt; police station where they were questioned and subsequently charged. The man was charged with one count of murder and another of attempted murder. The woman was charged with two counts of being an accessory to murder.

Both suspects were refused bail and are due to appear in court on Monday.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Snowy%20Hydro%20Scheme%20to%20go%20public&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales (NSW)&lt;/a&gt; government says small investors will have the first opportunity to buy shares in one of Australia's most unique public assets - the &lt;a href="w%3ASnowy_Mountains_Scheme"&gt;Snowy Hydro Scheme&lt;/a&gt;, the sale of which begins officially on Monday, May 22. NSW Finance Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Della%20Bosca"&gt;John Della Bosca&lt;/a&gt; denied the sale was incongruent with &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Labor's&lt;/a&gt; stance on privatisation, or that it was a pre-election strategy.

The New South Wales, Victorian and federal government jointly owns the &lt;a href="w%3Ahydroelectric"&gt;hydroelectric&lt;/a&gt; scheme and have decided to sell their shares by floating the company on the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Stock%20Exchange"&gt;Australian Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt;.

NSW taxpayers hold 58 per cent of the shares in the scheme and the State government stands to make between $1.5 billion and $2 billion from the sale. Selling the Snowy Hydro scheme could raise up to $3 billion for the Victorian, NSW and federal governments. 

Mr Della Bosca told the ABC: "We've looked at all sorts of arrangements to raise more capital." He said the sale would secure the future of Snowy Hydro. "Snowy is at a point where it's not responsible for it to go further into debt and the best thing for it, to be able to do, is raise capital on the stock exchange." The Minister denied the privatisation was a "grab for cash".

Liberal Senator Bill Heffernan is demanding a constitutional referendum to hand control of all rivers to the Commonwealth. He claims the Snowy Hydro sale would damage regional Australia and is being forced by state governments, to prop up their budgets. "I've expressed my extreme distress and disappointment both to the federal and state governments in no uncertain manner," he said. "I think it's a national disgrace and I think we will live to regret it in the future. 

Senator Heffernan says he has had trouble trying to raise the issue with his colleague, the Finance Minister Nick Minchin. "There's been no discussions," he said. 

NSW irrigators have withdrawn support for the sale after the NSW, Victorian and federal governments agreed to a 10 per cent limit on the number of shares an individual can buy. 

Greens MP Slyvia Hale says she believes the Government will attempt to limit the release of documents relating to the sale when Parliament resumes next week. "As with everything connected with the sale things have been kept very quiet and the Government will continue, I believe, to try and ensure that critical information is withheld from the public," she said.

She says the sale should be suspended while an inquiry takes place.

<h1>Ray Nagin re-elected New Orleans mayor</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Ray%20Nagin%20re-elected%20New%20Orleans%20mayor&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Orleans"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt; Mayor &lt;a href="w%3ARay%20Nagin"&gt;Ray Nagin&lt;/a&gt; won re-election Saturday night, successfully weathering a challenge from &lt;a href="w%3ALouisiana"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; Lieutenant Governor &lt;a href="w%3AMitch%20Landrieu"&gt;Mitch Landrieu&lt;/a&gt; and allowing him to oversee the continued rebuilding of the Louisiana city decimated by &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt;.

With all 442 precincts reporting, Nagin won 59,460 votes (52.3%) to Landrieu's 54,131 votes (47.7%). The two candidates had been neck-and-neck in the returns through the night. Early returns with 22% of precincts reporting showed Nagin leading 51% to 49%, while a later update with 48% of precincts showed Landrieu with the lead with the same margin.
Nagin first won the office in 2002, winning 76,469 votes (58.72%). Nagin, a Cable Executive, defeated New Orleans police chief, Richard Pennington, in that election by a lead of more than 22,000 votes with Pennington receiving 53,781 votes (41.29%). The total votes cast for both mayoral candidates in 2002 was 130,250 in comparison with the 113,591 total votes cast in this latest election.

Both Nagin and Landrieu called for the citizens of New Orleans to work together in unity. Nagin, in his victory speech, said, "It's time for us to stop the bickering. It's time for us to stop measuring things in black and white and yellow and Asian. It's time for us to be one New Orleans."

Landrieu struck a similar tone in his concession speech: "One thing is for sure that we as a people have got to come together so we can speak with one voice and one purpose," he said. "Join with me in supporting Mayor Nagin."

Nagin and Landrieu, both Democrats, agreed on most issues confronting New Orleans, including upholding the right of residents to rebuild in all areas of the city, and lobbying for increased recovery aid and upgraded levee protection. 

What differentiated the two candidates was leadership style. Nagin, a former cable executive is best known for his maverick, straight-talking, political-outsider style, and his sometimes controversial remarks to the media in the aftermath of Katrina. Landrieu, a member of a prominent political family in Louisiana, emphasized his ability to reach consensus and bring people together during the campaign.

Race also appears to have played a factor, with Nagin winning majority black neighborhoods and Landrieu winning majority white neighborhoods. However, Nagin did also get a significant crossover vote from the more heavily populated, predominantly white neighborhoods. In 2002, both mayoral candidates, Nagin and Pennington, were black. Nagin won 100% of predominantly white precincts in that election while his opponent faired better in predominantly black precincts.

Louisiana Secretary of State Al Ater said that turnout was comparable to the &lt;a href="Nagin%2C%20Landrieu%20advance%20to%20runoff%20in%20New%20Orleans%20mayoral%20election"&gt;April 22 primary&lt;/a&gt;, when about 37 percent of eligible voters cast ballots.

Nagin's new term begins May 31, one day before the Atlantic hurricane season begins.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Finnish%20metal%20band%20win%2051st%20Eurovision%20Song%20Contest&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3ALordi"&gt;Lordi&lt;/a&gt;, described as "cartoon metalheads" wearing latex monster masks, beat runner-up Russian "heart throb" Dima Bilan to win this year's 51st &lt;a href="w%3AEurovision%20song%20contest"&gt;Eurovision song contest&lt;/a&gt; held in &lt;a href="w%3AAthens%2C%20Greece"&gt;Athens, Greece&lt;/a&gt;. 
Bosnia's Hari Mata Hariwas came third.

In a spectacular show, hosted by Maria Menounos and Sakis Rouvas, Lordi amassed 292 points after a public vote - 44 ahead of Russia. Greece's singer Anna Vissi, who was one of the favourites to win, came 9th, followed by Ireland's Brian Kennedy. From the start of the song contest as well as during the televoting, the Greek organisers presented viewers choreographies and dances inspired by Greek culture and music, both ancient and modern. In addition, the world famous Greek singer Nana Moushouri was presented by the hosts and gave the sign for the start of televoting.

Wielding spark-spewing instruments, the "Monster-themed" rock band beat 23 other competitors, scoring 292 points from telephone voters in 38 countries with its song &lt;a href="w%3AHard%20Rock%20Hallelujah"&gt;"Hard Rock Hallelujah"&lt;/a&gt; in a performance that both shocked and amused viewers.

A spokesperson for Lordi said: "We won the contest, looking like this,” he said. “It just goes to show that Europe is not such a bad place." The Finnish band thanked viewers for voting for their song, which featured the lead singer hoisting a double-headed-axe microphone stand above his head. The win has been dubbed as a "radical departure" from the catchy pop tunes, folk songs and emotional ballads normally associated with Eurovision.

Complete with distorted guitars, a catchy chorus and "mock-demonic imagery," Lordi is reminiscent of 1970s American band &lt;a href="w%3AKISS"&gt;Kiss&lt;/a&gt; - an inspiration acknowledged by lead singer Mr Lordi. "What this has shown is that there are different styles of music than just pop and rock," Mr Lordi told news media after the surprise victory. "That should be the goal of Eurovision," he said.

Mr. Lordi, whose real name is Tomi Putaansuu, hails from Lapland and says his band's masked personas are just characters. "The guys behind the masks are not interesting - underneath, there's just a boring, normal guy who walks the dogs, goes to the supermarket, watches DVDs and eats candies. You really don't want to see him." he said. But the characters "live on stage and they live in a fantasy world", he said. "This element of mystery is one of the cornerstones of Lordi." 

The band has upset many Finns with their outrageous behaviour. "This is a victory for rock music... and also a victory for open-mindedness," Mr Lordi said. "For the millionth time, we’re not Satanists or devil worshippers. This is entertainment. The masks are like our calling card and we’ll never perform without them. It would be like Santa Claus handing a child his gifts at Christmas time and then pulling off his beard…"

The 51st annual Eurovision was broadcast live across Europe, watched by an estimated 100 million viewers. Regarded by many as the "contest good taste forgot," Eurovision is adored by fans of kitsch and camp everywhere. 

Lordi join the likes of Abba, Bucks Fizz, Dana and Celine Dion on the elite list of Eurovision winners.

Because of Lordi's first place finish, next year the 52nd Eurovision Song Contest will take place, for the first time, in &lt;a href="w%3AHelsinki%2C%20Finland"&gt;Helsinki, Finland&lt;/a&gt;.

Two &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; special forces troops and a &lt;a href="US"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; soldier were among 34 killed in &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; in a violent upsurge in recent days. General Rahmatullah Raufi, military commander for the southern provinces, said the clash erupted when militants ambushed a military convoy.

Fears of a resurgence of the &lt;a href="Afghan%20Taliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt; have been boosted by a sharp rise in violence in the past few weeks, much of it in Helmand province. Around 120 people died in 24 hours last week. Attacks on Friday have claimed another 34 lives. Officials say the fighting was some of the heaviest since the Taliban were ousted by the US-led invasion in 2001.

The French Defence Ministry said two French soldiers were killed on Saturday in a battle with Taliban forces in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKandahar"&gt;Kandahar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . France has had 200 special forces officers in south-eastern Afghanistan since 2003. A US soldier was killed and six others wounded after a bloody clash on Friday in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOruzgan%20Province"&gt;Uruzgan province&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , when a joint patrol encountered Taliban fighters.

The Taliban have stepped up attacks on foreign and government forces recently as &lt;a href="NATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; increases its peacekeeping force from 9,000 to 16,000 - as they prepare to take over from US forces in the South.

Helmand, the main &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aopium"&gt;opium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; poppy-growing region, has become a major focus of violence. Over the past week there has also been attacks in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AZabul%20province"&gt;Zabul province&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the western city of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHerat"&gt;Herat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Scattered clashes in the southern provinces in the past four days have killed around 150 people, including Taliban, Afghan police and military personnel and civilians.

Survivors were found on 22 Vietnamese ships near the &lt;a href="w%3APratas%20Islands"&gt;Pratas Islands&lt;/a&gt;, off the southern coast of &lt;a href="w%3AGuangdong"&gt;Guangdong province&lt;/a&gt;. State television reported the rescue as the "largest international marine rescue operation ever mounted by China." 

Eight fishing ships sank 1,000 km east of &lt;a href="w%3AVietnam"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;'s central city of &lt;a href="w%3ADa%20Nang"&gt;Danang&lt;/a&gt;, while eight remained missing. Rescuers had found 26 bodies and rescued 81 others, the Vietnamese government said in a statement. "However, the number of missing fishermen and the ships remains huge," Prime Minister Phan Van Khai said on state-run Vietnam Television. 

On the Da Nang coast, relatives of the missing fishermen erected altars with flowers and fruits. Weeping families burnt incense and prayed for loved ones to return.

&lt;a href="w%3ATyphoon%20Chanchu"&gt;Typhoon Chanchu&lt;/a&gt; was downgraded to a tropical storm on Thursday when it crossed the southern Chinese coast. The storm caused landslides, flooding and forced around a million people to evacuate. Landslides and collapsing buildings killed 15 people and left four missing in China's &lt;a href="w%3AFujian"&gt;Fujian province&lt;/a&gt;. Eight more people died in neighboring Guangdong province. Flooding in southern &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; swept two women to their deaths. 

Chanchu, the most powerful on record to enter the &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20China%20Sea"&gt;South China Sea&lt;/a&gt; in May, left a wake of damage in the region - killing at least 37 people in the Philippines last weekend. 

The typhoon, with winds of up to 170 km per hour, has reportedly killed 23 people in China. Vietnam's Fisheries Ministry had listed more than 400 fishermen as missing from Danang city and the nearby provinces of &lt;a href="w%3AQuang%20Nam"&gt;Quang Nam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AQuang%20Ngai%20Province"&gt;Quang Ngai&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;br style="clear:both;"&gt;

Andrew Martinez, a former student at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20California%20at%20Berkeley"&gt;University of California at Berkeley&lt;/a&gt; who was better known as "&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Naked%20Guy"&gt;The Naked Guy&lt;/a&gt;" in the early 1990s, committed suicide on Thursday. He was 33.

Guards at the Santa Clara County Jail reportedly found Martinez unconscious in a jail cell, with a plastic bag cinched around his neck, at about 11:19 p.m. Wednesday. Martinez was taken to a local hospital where was pronounced dead early Thursday. He had been incarcerated since January 10 on charges of battery and assault with a deadly weapon. 

Martinez is best known for attending his classes in the nude in the fall of 1992. He became an instant celebrity, appearing on national television talk shows where he defended his practice as a form of free speech and a challenge to sexual repression in Western society.

Martinez was eventually expelled from UC Berkeley for violating the school's code of conduct, and &lt;a href="w%3ABerkeley"&gt;Berkeley&lt;/a&gt; city officials passed a strict anti-nudity ordinance.

Family and acquaintances report that Martinez had been suffering from undetermined mental illness over the past decade for which he never found comprehensive treatment, and had been in and out of halfway houses, psychiatric institutions, and jail.

Said close acquaintance Bryan Schwartz, a civil rights lawyer in Washington, D.C., "He was a person with tremendous gifts and charisma who could have been a great asset to our society, but instead I feel like society -- me included -- failed him. It's such a waste."

&lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; has rejected &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; incentives to give up its &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Auranium"&gt;uranium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; enrichment program. Foreign ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi said that any plan has to acknowledge Iran's legal rights under &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ainternational%20law"&gt;international law&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , including Article IV of the .

It is believed that &lt;a href="UK"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, all member states of the EU, are developing incentives for Iran to give up its enrichment programming in an attempt to defuse mutual fears and perceptions of threats by &lt;a href="US"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;i, and Iranian governments. The incentives are believed to include a raft of security, trade and technology benefits.

The proposal by the three EU members encourages other nations to support the construction of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALight%20water%20reactor"&gt;light water power generation reactors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , to set up a nuclear fuel bank and the relaxation of &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; trade restrictions to allow Iran to purchase commercial planes built in the US. These incentives are conditional upon Iran renouncing its rights under Article IV of the NPT, i.e. stopping its Uranium enrichment program, and cooperating with the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="International%20Atomic%20Energy%20Agency"&gt;International Atomic Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt; (IAEA) in ways additional to its present cooperation, which at present includes continuous monitoring of many key Iranian nuclear facilities by the IAEA.

If Iran doesn't comply, Britain, France and Germany will support economic sanctions against Iran, the refusal to issue visas to Iranian officials and a freeze on the assets belonging to individuals and corporations with ties to the Iranian regime.

Mr Asefi said he would not comment on the proposal at this stage. He said it would be "hasty to comment on a raw proposal that has been brought up in the media, and still neither officially nor unofficially given to us."

Mr Asefi said that any plan would have to recognise Iran's rights to be considered. "The basis of our work is that the Islamic Republic of Iran's rights must be recognised in any plan," he said.

"We cannot retreat. The proposal should provide ways to secure our rights," he said. "We will not stop enrichment."

Mr. Asefi warned Europe against economic sanctions saying that they would harm Europe. "We have broad trade and economic ties with European and non-European countries. These ties can be damaged and this damage will harm European countries even more." he said.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Delhi"&gt;New Delhi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — Almost 10,000 people marched to &lt;a href="w%3AYantra%20Mandir%20%28Delhi%29"&gt;Jantar Mantar&lt;/a&gt; from Maulana Azad Medical College in an &lt;a href="w%3AReservation%20in%20India"&gt;anti-reservation rally&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday. Doctors and medical students say they will continue to strike and protest, despite an appeal from the prime minister to call off their agitation.

Students from &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Delhi"&gt;Delhi University&lt;/a&gt; and medical colleges around the capital, parents, lawyers, and accountants joined the striking medicos, under the banner of ‘Youth for Equality’.

The students and their supporters want total rollback of a proposed quota-hike for &lt;a href="w%3AOther_Backward_Class"&gt;Other Backward Classes&lt;/a&gt; (OBCs) in elite educational institutions, and a review of the present reservation policy. "There are very less seats in the post-graduate streams compared to the undergraduate courses. Hence the reservation move will affect the future of majority students," said student leader Praful Raj. 

The students have support from many groups. They were led by the Youth for Equality, an AIIMS initiative, while United Students, a DU and JNU group, IIT alumni, RWAs (under the banner of United Residents Joint Action), Resident Doctors Associations from various government and private hospitals, Chartered Accountant’s Association, students from private universities like IP, and parents of agitating students also joined in. 

Students from medical colleges in &lt;a href="Rajasthan"&gt;Rajasthan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AOrissa"&gt;Orissa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGujarat"&gt;Gujarat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APunjab%20%28India%29"&gt;Punjab&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Karnataka"&gt;Karnataka&lt;/a&gt; also took part in the rally. Students and doctors say the government has showed "scant regard to the sentiments of the students", who have been protesting the proposed quota-hike for OBCs in elite educational institutions.

The students had appealed to &lt;a href="w%3AManmohan%20Singh"&gt;Prime Minister Manmohan Singh&lt;/a&gt; to set up a non-political judicial committee to review the existing reservation policy and sought an audience with him to discuss the issue.

At 7 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3APacific_Daylight_Time"&gt;PDT&lt;/a&gt; the 499-foot water &lt;a href="w%3Acooling%20tower"&gt;cooling tower&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3ATrojan%20Nuclear%20Power%20Plant"&gt;Trojan Nuclear Power plant&lt;/a&gt; was imploded using dynamite. The cooling tower, which is located in &lt;a href="w%3ARainier%2C%20Oregon"&gt;Rainier, Oregon&lt;/a&gt;, is the largest in the world to be demolished. For the past thirty years the tower has been an icon of the &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Northwest"&gt;Pacific Northwest&lt;/a&gt;. 

Controlled Demolition Incorporated, which was hired to bring down the tower, used approximately 3,300 sticks of &lt;a href="w%3Adynamite"&gt;dynamite&lt;/a&gt;. The company also imploded the King Dome in &lt;a href="w%3ASeattle"&gt;Seattle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AWashington"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; in 2000. Prior to the implosion, Interstate 5 and Highway 30 as well as river traffic on the &lt;a href="w%3AColumbia%20River"&gt;Columbia River&lt;/a&gt; was blocked as a precaution.

The plant, which is owned by &lt;a href="w%3APortland%20General%20Electric"&gt;Portland General Electric&lt;/a&gt;, began operation in May 1976 and was shut down in January 1993 due to structural problems. It was decommissioned in 1999 when the reactor was taken upstream by barge to &lt;a href="w%3AHanford%20Nuclear%20Reservation"&gt;Hanford Nuclear Reservation&lt;/a&gt;. Some fuel rods are buried at the site, although they are in a casket over 900 feet from where the cooling tower sits.

Three days after the Internet release of the &lt;a href="w%3Afree%20content"&gt;free content&lt;/a&gt; 3D short ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AElephants%20Dream"&gt;Elephants Dream&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ (see ), we exchanged e-mails with &lt;a href="w%3ATon%20Roosendaal"&gt;Ton Roosendaal&lt;/a&gt; about the reaction to the film, open source filmmaking, and the changes to &lt;a href="w%3ABlender%20%28software%29"&gt;Blender&lt;/a&gt; that resulted from the production. Ton Roosendaal is the lead developer of the &lt;a href="w%3ABlender%20%28software%29"&gt;Blender&lt;/a&gt; 3D rendering and modelling software that was used for the movie. He is also the chairman of the &lt;a href="w%3ABlender%20Foundation"&gt;Blender Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, a non-profit organization which was formed in support of the software and projects like ♡❤Elephants Dream♡❤.

♡❤♡How much money did the Blender Foundation spend on producing the movie? Has the money been fully recouped by DVD orders and donations?♡❤♡

We still have to finish the final bookkeeping for this project. It has been executed in co-production with the Netherlands Media Art 
Institute, and we each had our own internal budgeting for the project. When you exclude expenses of pre-production and producer personnel, the 
total budget was about 120,000 €, of which we covered half. Our contribution was roughly covered half by the DVD sales, and half by European Union support (http://www.uni-verse.org consortium).

♡❤♡One of the most common criticisms of CGI films is focus on technology over content. For instance, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AFinal%20Fantasy%3A%20The%20Spirits%20Within"&gt;Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ flopped with audiences, in spite of being an undisputed technical milestone. I've seen many reviews that criticized the plot of "Elephants Dream" as too bizarre or confusing. In retrospect, are you happy with the story development process?♡❤♡

Haha, I knew the story and plot would get a mixed acclaim. There's a couple of reasons I'd like to mention for it.

First of all; the criticism resembles how people witness Blender itself, too. Many people expect that Free Software is an easy accessible mass audience product. We get a lot of complaints by non-artists that they can't get into the software easily, whilst the complexity of commercial products like Maya or Houdini is perceived as a confirmation of its "quality". Apparently an Open Movie created similar expectations with the audience.

Luckily we also got many positive reviews of the artistic result of the movie. It is quite abstract, but definitely has many layers of information, inspiring many of the viewers to see relevant real life messages hidden here.

For this project we've teamed up with the Netherlands Media Art Institute, internationally renowned as a resource for video art. So for ♡❤Elephants Dream♡❤, we've had the luxury to challenge ourselves to create real independent artistic content as well. The artists had a lot of freedom from the start; they were responsible for the concept, story and creative development of the entire movie. This has resulted in a lot of quite personal choices, based on what the artists liked to do themselves. I really cherish such an approach, it has resulted in a very motivated team working crazy hours the last months to get it all realized.

But, most importantly; the main target of our project was not only to create a 3D movie short, but to experiment with ways to improve the efficiency and quality of open source development. On this aspect only, this project was just a huge success, and the main reason for our sponsors (the DVD pre-sale) to support it. I know they might have liked a cartoonish funny movie with furry animals better, but for that you get already pretty well served by the bigger 3D animation studios. :)

I'm the first to admit that - looking back especially - certain aspects worked out quite weakly; there's loose ends and questionable decisions, 
especially in story development and continuity. That's just the risk of doing experiments, and nothing I regret really. The five artists from our user community who were invited to make the movie were young people with no professional background in filmmaking. Their personal incentive to participate in this project was also to learn from it, and to create a good portfolio for their future career. I've witnessed them grow in competence in the past year enormously, something I'm incredibly proud of.

♡❤♡On the technical level, the only major criticism I've seen of "Elephants Dream" is the character animation, especially in the opening scene -- many reviewers felt that the movements seemed a bit unnatural. Do you agree with these criticisms? If so, what do you think can be done to improve on that level?♡❤♡

Yeah, the challenge the artists set themselves - to use quite realistic personages - is also something that easily works against you. In many 
animation movies they introduce characters in the beginning in a way you get used to their specific characteristic movements, so you accept 
a certain level of non-realism easily. (Check the weird walk cycles in ♡❤The Incredibles♡❤ for example). Another aspect is that we've started work on the first scenes, and ended with the last scenes. I can clearly see the animation quality increase, and that whilst the ending scenes were done in much less time due to time constraints.

We also didn't schedule to do 9.5 minutes of animation either…. Originally it was more like 6. But, it's always easier to look back to define the right decisions, eh? :)

I'm very happy with the reviews we got so far; luckily the movie was perceived as a professional quality product, and reviewed based on comparisons with what the big studios come up with. Even when we couldn't satisfy all these quality demands, it has luckily not been branded as a pathetic presumptuous attempt by amateurs!

♡❤♡Do you think there is hope for a full-length open movie project in the near future? Would the Blender Foundation be interested in such a project, or do you intend to continue focusing mainly on shorts?♡❤♡

I'd like to wait a little while with defining what a next project would look like. Given the constraints of "organizing projects to improve 
open source development", we might have not much choice either. It would probably mean to work with a new team each time, so most likely 
be based on shorts only. On the other hand, there's also clear signals that this approach works well, and creates excitement and involvement of a lot of people, also from producers and sponsors. That might enable us to set up a next project based on larger targets. For a full-length feature film however, we should involve a sufficient amount of experienced film makers as well, and/or invite the first team to participate again. That would put a lot of pressure on the required budget…. You can't do that based on a 1000 DVD pre-sale target. Would more be like 20,000 or so…. :)

♡❤♡How did the process of making the movie feed back into the development of Blender? Are there major technical changes that were made only or primarily because of the film?♡❤♡

Already during the pre-production phase the artists have defined the key targets for Blender development. This then was coordinated with the 
online development community too. I've done the most crucial (re-)development mostly myself, though. Especially on the character animation tools, on the &lt;a href="w%3Arendering%20pipeline"&gt;rendering pipeline&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Acompositing"&gt;compositing&lt;/a&gt; tools.

It is especially the latter I'm most satisfied with. In 3D movie production the compositing stage creates a giant content bottleneck. By transparently integrating this in our render-pipeline, a very efficient workflow has been achieved. And, not to forget, Blender now also offers the first production-level open source compositor on the market!

The current summary you can find in our &lt;a href="http%3A//www.blender.org/cms/Changes_since_last_ver.727.0.html"&gt;work-in-progress release notes&lt;/a&gt;.

♡❤♡What are the key technical features in Blender you want to add or improve for future movie projects?♡❤♡

Depends on what the movie is about! There's always hundreds of features you can work on. However, we'll have to work on that anyway, movie project or not. There's a lot of professionals using Blender ♡❤now♡❤, and they can't wait for the Blender Foundation to do movies! Look at this studio for example:
http://www.plumiferos.com/

♡❤♡I read that at least one proprietary software package, Reaktor, was used for the sound effects. Is this because no equivalent free software solution exists yet? Will future projects have a "free software only" policy?♡❤♡

We've limited the "Open Source tools" requirement to our own Studio Orange only. That was what we could keep in control at least, and I can tell you it was not always easy even... :)

For sound and music we've decided from the beginning to seek an external sponsor. We have chosen to work with the best quality studio and composer we could find, preferably using open source, but not as a prerequisite.

My own competence is solely within the CG [computer graphics, Ed.] side of movie making. When it comes to music editing, or video encoding and DVD authoring, I could only decide to choose to work with external parties with proven competences in that area. I have to be practical in projects like this, especially to ensure it will be realized.

Hopefully, now we've got so much attention world wide, we can involve more non-CG open source next time, too. I will definitely strive for the maximum here, but it will fully depend on the amount of professional support we can get.

♡❤♡Blender itself was originally closed source freeware, until it was "liberated" through a fundraising campaign. If you could choose one proprietary application to "set free" where such a goal could be realistically achieved, which one would it be?♡❤♡

Well, the "realistically achieved" demand makes it quite difficult. :) Looking back at similar cases, like &lt;a href="w%3AMozilla"&gt;Mozilla&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AOpenOffice.org"&gt;OpenOffice.org&lt;/a&gt;, it 
was always very circumstantial. It just happens sometimes, you can't organize something like this to happen in advance. The only common denominator is "a company in troubles"… so, who's in trouble now?

♡❤♡What is your personal favorite computer-animated full-length film?♡❤♡

Uuuh… that differs every week! Probably ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AIce%20Age%20%28film%29"&gt;Ice Age&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ (the first one). Mostly because they didn't overdo showcasing 3D technology so much, but created truly adorable characters and great funny gags.

During the weekend, 11 estates in the capital of &lt;a href="Norway"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Oslo"&gt;Oslo&lt;/a&gt;, received suspicious white powder by mail. The owners of the estates are mainly elders, and mainly the estates are located in the west.

Some of these owners have received antibiotic cures, because this powder might be &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aanthrax"&gt;anthrax&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The test-results for anthrax were released during the morning of the 22nd of May.

The results of the tests did not indicate any form for anthrax. However, this is the second time that white powder is found in the mail, the first time was shortly after the &lt;a href="9-11%20attacks"&gt;9-11 attacks&lt;/a&gt;.

A lone gunman has shot and killed four in-laws at the Ministry of Jesus Christ church in &lt;a href="w%3ABaton_Rouge"&gt;Baton Rouge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALouisiana"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;.

The suspect, identified as Anthony Bell (25), was arrested Sunday in a nearby apartment block close to the church. The suspect's wife, Erica Bell (24), was also shot and killed.

Bell abducted his wife and her three children during a Sunday morning church service. The children, one was an infant, were found unharmed. His relatives described Bell as having “domestic problems”.

It is unclear where the fatal shooting of Mr. Bell's wife occurred. The church pastor and mother to Erica Bell, Claudia Brown, was wounded during the rampage and was hospitalized in serious condition. 

Bell has been charged with five counts of murder, attempted murder, and kidnapping.

<h1>Downer welcomes Australian nuclear energy debate</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Downer%20welcomes%20Australian%20nuclear%20energy%20debate&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia's&lt;/a&gt; foreign affairs minister &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Downer"&gt;Alexander Downer&lt;/a&gt; has given his support for a serious debate on nuclear energy in Australia. Mr Downer's comments follow similar comments made by Australian &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; last week.

Mr Downer said that climate change has strongly influenced many to change their position on nuclear power and to encourage debate. He encouraged people to keep an open mind on nuclear power within the context of reducing greenhouse gases. The production of nuclear energy produces far fewer greenhouse gas emissions than coal and oil power stations.

Mr Downer also said that it would make sense for Australia to investigate nuclear power generation given that it has 30 to 40 percent of the world's &lt;a href="w%3AUranium"&gt;Uranium&lt;/a&gt; reserves.

Mr Downer said any discussion would need to look at whether Australia would build nuclear power stations in the future and whether a Uranium enrichment program would be undertaken.

"There's the question of whether Australia itself would eventually, some time, no doubt in the far distant future, build nuclear power stations," he said.

"There's a question of whether Australia would ever enrich uranium - in other words, we go up the processing chain, rather than just dig it out." Mr Downer said.

Unlike Australian industry minister, Ian MacFarlane and finance minister, Nick Minchin, Mr Downer refused to say when he thought nuclear energy would become a reality in Australia. Mr Downer said the construction of nuclear power plants would depend on two things - political debate and economic considerations. Mr Downer said that nuclear power plants can be very expensive to build and they would need to be comparable in overall cost to oil and coal based power plants for it to make economic sense.

Opposition treasury spokesman Wayne Swan has said he does not support Australia building nuclear power plants. He also said that Australia had large energy reserves and has no need for nuclear power generation. "We are a country with an abundance of energy, we're are optimistic about what can occur with clean coal technologies, we have an abundant supply of gas – I don't see the need for Australia to go down that road."

&lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Rocket"&gt;Mark Rocket&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3AChristchurch"&gt;Christchurch&lt;/a&gt; Internet entrepreneur, has purchased a $300,000 flight into space with &lt;a href="w%3AVirgin%20Galactic"&gt;Virgin Galactic&lt;/a&gt;.

In 2008 he will take off for space from the &lt;a href="w%3AMojave%20Desert"&gt;Mojave Desert&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; in an eight man &lt;a href="w%3Aspacecraft"&gt;spacecraft&lt;/a&gt;. He will spend about 10 minutes in space.

He has said that he always wanted to go into space ever since seeing the first &lt;a href="w%3AStar%20Wars"&gt;Star Wars&lt;/a&gt; movie. He even changed his name because of the movie, but won't say what from.

He has already been to &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; to see the development of the rocket and visited the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Space%20Development%20Conference"&gt;International Space Development Conference&lt;/a&gt;.

Mark Rocket said: "I guess I'm just a real space nut."

<h1>NSW govt to rebuild high school with private funding</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=NSW%20govt%20to%20rebuild%20high%20school%20with%20private%20funding&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; minister for Education and Training, Carmel Tebbutt told parliament that Kelso High School, which was destroyed by fire on August 18, 2005 will be rebuilt under the NSW government's New Schools Public Private Partnerships (PPP) program. Under the program, the bulk of construction costs come from private companies who own the schools for 30 years, after which time they revert to government ownership.

The PPP program began in October 2001. According to the government, 19 schools will be delivered under the PPP program by 2009.

The announcement follows Member for Bathurst, Gerard Martin's statement to parliament on September 14, 2005 that the government would be rebuilding the school at a cost of $18 to $25 million. "The Government has accepted the responsibility of the $18 million to $25 million to rebuild the school, which is proceeding post haste" he said.

The PPP announcement has been seen as a backflip by the government.

When approached by Wikinews, Brad Hazzard, the opposition's education spokesperson said that the coalition did not have a formal policy in this area but generally were supportive of the PPP program so long as infrastructure and maintenance are addressed.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Greens"&gt;Australian Greens&lt;/a&gt; education spokesperson, John Kaye, said that problems were already emerging with the PPP program in NSW. In March 2006, it was revealed that the government had to negotiate an exit strategy so that after school hours child care could be provided. In a media release provided to Wikinews, Dr Kaye said, "Yet another flaw in a NSW Public Private Partnership (PPP) has been uncovered. Just like the Cross City Tunnel, the community suffered because the contract failed to protect the quality of service delivery,"

“After numerous complaints from parents, the Iemma government had to negotiate an exit strategy from the contract to provide out-of-school-hours childcare. Corporate giant ABC Learning which had purchased the original provider, Peppercorn, was clearly not interested in the expensive end of childcare".

Dr Kaye also pointed out that an Auditor general’s report found alarming evidence that the basis for PPP in NSW could be based on unreliable financial models. Dr Kaye said that the Auditor General has "cast a very large shadow" over the government's claimed savings from the PPP program.

“It appears that the NSW government does not know with any degree of certainty how much it would cost to perform the same function in the public sector. Any attempt to say that private sector control is cheaper is now fraught with danger,"

“The Auditor General’s report proves that the methodology used by the Government to estimate the costs of public sector provision is highly unreliable and suspect" said Dr Kaye.

Both Carmel Tebbutt and Gerard Martin gave no response when contacted by Wikinews.

Australian &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20John%20Howard"&gt;Prime Minister John Howard&lt;/a&gt; has announced he wants a "full-scale nuclear debate", and three of his senior federal government frontbenchers - Foreign Minister &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Downer"&gt;Alexander Downer&lt;/a&gt;, Resources Minister, &lt;a href="w%3AIan%20Macfarlane%20%28politician%29"&gt;Ian Macfarlane&lt;/a&gt;, and Environment Minister &lt;a href="w%3AIan%20Campbell"&gt;Ian Campbell&lt;/a&gt; - have all suggested Australia, which has around 40 per cent of the world's known uranium reserves, should consider enriching uranium - a step in processing that would allow it to be used as &lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20reactor"&gt;reactor fuel&lt;/a&gt; as well as for &lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20weapons"&gt;nuclear weapons&lt;/a&gt;. 

However there is strong opposition for nuclear power in the Australian community. The &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Greens"&gt;Australian Greens&lt;/a&gt; have rejected the Prime Minister's assumption that &lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20Power"&gt;nuclear power&lt;/a&gt; might be 'desirable' for Australia. The Greens say they challenge Mr Howard to show "true leadership on &lt;a href="w%3Aclimate%20change"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Anuclear%20non-proliferation"&gt;nuclear non-proliferation.&lt;/a&gt;"

Greens climate change and energy spokesperson &lt;a href="w%3ASenator%20Christine%20Milne"&gt;Senator Christine Milne&lt;/a&gt; said Mr Howard was "playing politics" by floating the idea and testing public opinion before developing a government position.

"Instead of pandering to &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20President%20George%20Bush"&gt;US President George Bush&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AUK%20Prime%20Minister%20Tony%20Blair"&gt;UK Prime Minister Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; - the two most unpopular leaders in the world today - Prime Minister Howard should demonstrate real leadership and put some authenticity into the government's response to climate change and terrorism," Senator Milne said. "Nuclear power and nuclear proliferation are a threat to both."

Senator Milne challenged advocates of nuclear power to explain what they will to do about nuclear waste, how large a public subsidy they are prepared to pay to prop up nuclear power, and why the &lt;a href="w%3ASustainable%20Development%20Commission"&gt;Sustainable Development Commission&lt;/a&gt; was wrong when it recommended last month against expanding nuclear power in Britain.

"Australians have already had to subsidise uranium mining companies to clean up after mines have closed, while last week's Budget papers revealed that &lt;a href="w%3AANTSO"&gt;ANSTO&lt;/a&gt; can't estimate the cost of decommissioning the &lt;a href="w%3ALucas%20Heights%20nuclear%20reactor"&gt;Lucas Heights nuclear reactor&lt;/a&gt;," Senator Milne said. "When will advocates of nuclear power admit that it is too slow, too expensive and too dangerous to be a solution to climate change? Nor is there any safe way to dispose of the waste. It is not even safe to transport, a concern supported by the head of the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Energy%20Agency"&gt;International Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt;..." said Senator Milne in a media release.

"Instead of turning to nuclear power, Australia should ratify the &lt;a href="w%3AKyoto%20Protocol"&gt;Kyoto Protocol&lt;/a&gt;, invest in renewable energy, adopt a national energy efficiency target and improve public transport.

"Several studies examining options to achieve deep cuts in Australian greenhouse emissions all show this goal can be achieved, cost effectively, without resorting to nuclear power," said Senator Milne in a media release.

Greens leader &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Brown"&gt;Bob Brown&lt;/a&gt; says the Prime Minister is sending a message of approval for Indonesia to become a nuclear power. "Australia and our region are essentially nuclear-free. Mr Howard is abandoning that security to grab uranium profits and facilitate an Australian role in nuclear enrichment," Senator Brown said. "This robs Australia of its moral strength to argue against Indonesia resurrecting the Soeharto plan for 12 nuclear reactors and to advance its interest in Russian-built floating nuclear power stations."

"This will make our region much less secure for the next generation of Australians," Senator Brown said. "John Howard has talked up regional terrorism. Now he is promoting nuclear power proliferation in our neighbourhood. At best his logic is faulty, at worst he is taking Australia into a future unnecessarily menaced by the nuclear threat," Senator Brown said. 

Labor MP Kelvin Thomson says John Howard's push towards nuclear power generation could heighten the risk of a terrorist attack. "The problem with nuclear power is that more of it that is around, the easier it is for terrorists to get access to it and I'm not satisfied that in this day and age we can be absolutely certain that terrorists can't access it," Mr Thomson said. 

Mr Thompson said the Government should be focussing its interest on "much safer and environmentally-friendly" abundant renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power. Mr Thomson said Australia was a potential world-leader in solar power. "Surely you exhaust all the other alternatives first before you say let's go down the nuclear road," he said. 

"The problem with nuclear power is that more of it that is around, the easier it is for terrorists to get access to it," he said. "I'm not satisfied that in this day and age you can be absolutely certain that terrorists can't access it."

Union leader Bill Shorten, a federal Labor candidate at the next election, believes the issue is unpopular with the electorate. A survey in 2005 found 47 percent of Australians supported nuclear power and 40 percent opposed it.

Professor Frank Muller from the University of New South Wales, said the framework to manage nuclear power needs to be put in place first. He says it could take decades before a nuclear power plant could operate. "So it actually takes even longer to provide a greenhouse benefit than it does to build a power plant," he said. Professor Muller says nuclear power stations are expensive to build, and safety is a major issue.

Opposition environment spokesman &lt;a href="Anthony%20Albanese"&gt;Anthony Albanese&lt;/a&gt; said: "John Howard's nuclear fantasy is Australia's nightmare," Mr Albanese told reporters. "Intractable problems with nuclear energy when it comes to economic costs, safety, disposal of waste and contribution to nuclear proliferation remain up to some 50 years."

Mr Albanese said that if Mr Howard was serious about nuclear power he should say where a nuclear power plant would be built, and where the waste it produced would be stored. "If he's so confident that nuclear energy is safe... I'm sure he'll have coalition MPs volunteering to have a nuclear reactor in their electorate and to store their waste in the electorate," he said. 

Mr Albanese said the current Labor policy remained opposed to nuclear energy in Australia.

&lt;a href="w%3ABushra%20Khalil"&gt;Bushra Khalil&lt;/a&gt;, one of the defense lawyers for former &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraqi&lt;/a&gt; President, &lt;a href="w%3ASaddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt;, was thrown out of court by &lt;a href="w%3ARauf%20Rashid%20Abd%20al-Rahman"&gt;Chief Judge Raouf Abdel&lt;/a&gt; after speaking out of turn.

"The right of defence is sacred. We have never seen in our whole career a lawyer ordered out of the court room like this. We should not be treated like this, we are defending those men who defended the honour of the nation, yes they are the honour of the nation," said an Egyptian lawyer, in court for Hussein's defense.

Khalil was attempting to make a speech when Judge Abdel told her to stop talking. When Khalil continued to speak out of turn, Judge Abdel ordered court guards to remove her from the courtroom. Khalil then threw her lawyer's robe onto the floor and walked out of the courtroom.

"You have to stick to the rules, you are a lawyer, you should behave by the rules," said Judge Abdel to Khalil while she left the courtroom.

Hussein objected to the judge's orders and protested saying, "I am Saddam Hussein, president of Iraq. I am above all."

"You were president, now you are the defendant," replied Judge Abdel.

This is the second time that Khalil was thrown out of the courtroom. Back in April, Judge Abdel had Khalil removed for the same reasons. This is also her first appearance in court since April's incident.

The head of the &lt;a href="World%20Health%20Organization"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WHO), &lt;a href="w%3ALee%20Jong-wook"&gt;Doctor Lee Jong-wook&lt;/a&gt;, 61, has died after doctors performed brain surgery on him to relieve a blood clot.

"I am sorry to tell you that Dr Lee Jong-wook, director-general of the WHO, died this morning. [This is a] very sad bit of news" and Lee "was an exceptional person and an exceptional director-general. Under his leadership, the WHO has been strengthened and has been able to give an effective response to world (health) problems," said Elena Salgado, &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;'s Health Minister in a statement during the organization's 192-nation annual assembly held in &lt;a href="Geneva"&gt;Geneva&lt;/a&gt;. The panel observed two minutes of silence to honor Lee.

Lee was rushed to Cantonal Hospital in Geneva when he felt sick on Saturday. He became sick while he was at an official meeting. Doctors then determined that he had a blood clot in his brain and operated on Lee immediately.

"He had been in hospital since Saturday afternoon, where he underwent surgery to remove a blood clot on his brain (a subdural hematoma). He remained in intensive care. At 07:43 this morning, he was declared dead," said a statement by the WHO on its website.

"All of the staff of the World Health Organization extend their most sincere condolences to Dr Lee's family. The sudden loss of our leader, colleague and friend, is devastating," continued the statement.

"The world has lost a great man today. LEE Jong-wook was a man of conviction and passion. He was a strong voice for the right of every man, woman and child to health prevention and care, and advocated on behalf of the very poorest people," said &lt;a href="Kofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt;, the United Nations Secretary General.

Lee became head of the WHO in 2003 and leaves behind his son, wife and two brothers.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Researchers%20say%20Ozone%20Hole%20%26quot%3Blikely%20to%20contract%2C%20may%20disappear%26quot%3B&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Researchers say the &lt;a href="w%3Aozone%20hole"&gt;ozone hole&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;a href="Antarctica"&gt;Antarctica&lt;/a&gt; is likely to contract and may disappear by 2050 - as a result of a global reduction of &lt;a href="w%3Achlorofluorocarbons"&gt;chlorofluorocarbons&lt;/a&gt; (CFCs) and other ozone-depleting emissions.

The findings are based on a series of numerical simulations carried out by Eiji Akiyoshi of &lt;a href="Tokyo"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;'s National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES), using projected emissions of CFCs and other gases blamed for the ozone hole. 

According to the &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;ese report released last week, the Antarctic ozone hole is currently at its largest, but is likely to begin gradual contraction around 2020 and possibly disappear around 2050. It is believed lowered CFC emissions can cause the hole to gradually close, the NIES reported. The team's findings are in line with research by other scientists.

The scientists say CFC levels in the Earth's atmosphere have been in gradual decline since the mid-1990s, as a result of global efforts to reduce their emission. 

But while Earth’s ozone layer is slowly being replenished following the international 1987 agreement banning CFCs, the &lt;a href="w%3AMontreal%20Protocol"&gt;Montreal Protocol&lt;/a&gt;, the recovery is occurring in a changing atmosphere and is unlikely to stabilize at pre-1980 levels, according to a recent &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Colorado"&gt;University of Colorado&lt;/a&gt; study. 

The co-author of a paper by the Danish Meteorological Institute in the May 2006 issue of ♡❤Nature♡❤ said: "We now have some confidence that the ozone layer is responding to the decreases in chlorine levels in the atmosphere due to the leveling off and decrease of CFCs, and most of the improvements are in agreement with what we had hoped for with the Montreal Protocol in place."

"But we are not out of the woods yet, and the ozone recovery process still faces a number of uncertainties." 

Other scientists say that harmful emissions have not been lowered enough to influence the ozone hole's size. Some scientists suggest the hole won't heal until much later because old refrigerators and air-conditioners still emit CFCs.

&lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Yee"&gt;James Yee&lt;/a&gt;, a Muslim chaplain formerly stationed at the &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20Bay%20detainment%20camp"&gt;Guantánamo detention camp&lt;/a&gt;, is now speaking out about his experience and the incidents he witnessed at Guantanamo. On May 22, Mr. Yee held a speech at &lt;a href="w%3ADartmouth%20College"&gt;Dartmouth College&lt;/a&gt; and told an audience of 100 he was accused of espionage and spying by the US in September 2003 and was kept in isolation for 76 days.

Mr Yee claimed in &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Dartmouth"&gt;The Dartmouth&lt;/a&gt;, a Dartmouth College newspaper, the United States was "accepting torture" and that this "damages the reputation of the U.S." He continued: "We've lost that status of being the beacon of human rights because of Abu Ghraib and Guantánamo".

On May 5 Mr Yee had spoken at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20California%2C%20Davis"&gt;University of California, Davis&lt;/a&gt;, to the UC Davis Center for the Study of Human Rights in the Americas (CSHRA). They had hosted a forum about the treatment of prisoners at Guantánamo Bay. 

Mr Yee believes journalists and congressmen who visit Guantánamo prison do not get an unsanitized picture of conditions there, and spoke at length about his personal experience there, what prisoners and interpreters told him during his time as Guantánamo chaplain, and what happened when he was imprisoned.

In one incident a cell door had mistakenly been left unlocked by guards, and a prisoner left his cell and attempted to lock the three guards in the cell while they were conducting a search. The guards easily overpowered the would-be escapee. "But the incident didn't stop there," said Mr Yee who said this incident lead to a violent reaction from the guards.

"One of the guards continued to bludgeon that prisoner on the back of the head after already being shackled at the ankles and his wrists behind his back and, of course, it was a bloody affair. There was blood all over."

Yee also said that some prisoners were children "the ages of some of the prisoners down there, as young as 12 to 14 years old. Prisoners as young as 12 to 14 years old were being held down in Guantánamo when I was there."

James Yee was accused of espionage by the military on September 10, 2003, and arrested while heading home from Cuba on a leave of absence. After 76 days, James Yee was released and the criminal charges against him were eventually dropped. He said he was locked away in solitary confinement and abused in a manner similar to that of the other detainees at Guantanamo.

About the treatment he received when he was imprisoned, Mr Yee said he was first more worried about his family, "I was arrested in secret, held incommunicado. I never showed up at the airport in Seattle like I was supposed to have, where my wife and daughter were waiting. They didn't know what happened to me. My parents in New Jersey had no idea what had happened. I essentially disappeared from society, from the face of the earth."

Mr Yee then said he was dressed up as a prisoner and subject to "sensory deprivation". "And down on the way, on this trip to Charleston, the guard pulls out of this bag these goggles ... so now I can't see a thing. He takes out these heavy industrial type ear muffs ... puts them on my ears, and now I can't hear a thing. We call this tactic 'sensory deprivation.' &lt;a href="w%3ASensory%20deprivation"&gt;Sensory deprivation&lt;/a&gt;, it's something that I recently read that the American Psychiatric Association has included in a draft of their definition of torture."

Taking an ironic look at his own capture Mr Yee said: "On another aspect of the treatment he experienced, Yee said, "One of the most ironic parts of this situation is that down in Guantanamo, as the Muslim chaplain, I was able to protect certain religious rights for the alleged, suspected, Taliban and al-Qaeda prisoners down in Guantanamo. The point is, I was denied my religious rights as a U.S. citizen in military custody, the very same rights that I was able to uphold for prisoners down in Guantanamo." 

Maj. Gen. &lt;a href="w%3AGeoffrey%20Miller%20%28general%29"&gt;Geoffrey Miller&lt;/a&gt;, commander of the Guantánamo detention camp, is said to have made the decision to jail Mr Yee. Miller was then transferred to Iraq, where there was a prisoner abuse scandal at Abu Ghraib. The extent of Miller's involvement in Mr Yee's treatment at Guatamano and Abu Ghraib is not known. The US administration has not elaborated on Mr Yee's claims.

In May 2004, when Mr Yee's case attracted the attention of the media, Gen. James Hill, chief of the U.S. Southern Command, which oversaw military operations at Guantanamo, called Yee's incarceration necessary, "given the circumstances at the time." Col. William Costello, a Southern Command spokesman, also said in May 2004, "There's really nothing more that we're going to share on the case. We've dropped the charges. ... I'm not at liberty to talk about what the investigation entailed." 

US have denied abuse on Guantánamo detention camp. On June 1st, 2005 &lt;a href="w%3ADonald%20Rumsfeld"&gt;Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld&lt;/a&gt;, said, "But little has been said about the great lengths that the military go to at Guantánamo Bay to accommodate the religious practices of detainees in their care. There are specific instructions as to how those involved in the custody of detainees should handle themselves with respect to religious matters. Special meals are provided to meet cultural dietary requirements. Schedules are respectful of prayer. Indications of the direction to pray are provided."

Luxembourg's largest steel company &lt;a href="w%3AArcelor"&gt;Arcelor&lt;/a&gt; is ready to study &lt;a href="w%3AMittal"&gt;Mittal Steel&lt;/a&gt;'s improved takeover offer, the former said on Sunday, opening the door to possible talks with Indian steel magnate Laxminivas Mittal. Arcelor Chairman Joseph Kinsch told reporters after a meeting of Arcelor's board that the company's directors would be ready to examine the details of Mittal's latest offer once it has been approved by the CSSF (Luxembourg's financial regulatory body). 

Until Sunday, Arcelor, the world's second-largest steel company, had firmly rejected world-leader Mittal's bid to take the former company over and form a global steel giant. The softening of Arcelor's stance comes after Mittal Steel raised its hostile cash-and-equity bid by a third on Friday and dropped a key demand for family control over the combined entity. 

Media reports had suggested that Arcelor was trying to find another company to rescue it from being taken over by Mittal Steel. Possible candidates included Russian tycoon &lt;a href="w%3AVladimir%20Lisin"&gt;Vladimir Lisin&lt;/a&gt; and Russia's &lt;a href="w%3AMagnitogorsk"&gt;Magnitogorsk&lt;/a&gt; Iron &amp; Steel Works (MMK). Mittal's move on Friday came after the value of its initial offer fell more than 10 percent behind the market worth of Arcelor, as the latter announced a buyback of its own shares at above-market prices to ward off Mittal Steel.

Laxminivas Mittal, who has hinted that the bitter takeover battle might have a hint of racism involved in it, told the French newspaper ♡❤La Tribune♡❤ that he was sure that the attractive nature of his revised offer would enable him to obtain over 50% of the Arcelor shares. He added that he was of the opinion that the involvement of a Russian third party would not be in the best interests of Arcelor's shareholders.

<h1>Seven year old boy swims from Alcatraz to San Francisco</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Seven%20year%20old%20boy%20swims%20from%20Alcatraz%20to%20San%20Francisco&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Braxton Bilbrey, a 7-year-old boy from &lt;a href="w%3AGlendale%2C%20California"&gt;Glendale, California&lt;/a&gt;, swam from &lt;a href="w%3AAlcatraz"&gt;Alcatraz&lt;/a&gt; to Aquatic Park in &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco%2C%20California"&gt;San Francisco, California&lt;/a&gt;. The length of the swim is approximately 1.4 miles.

"It kind of seems like a long way, but I'm not totally worried. It's not that far," Bilbrey said before he started swimming.

"For a 7-year-old to be that motivated and stick with a goal that long is amazing," said Bilbrey's mother, Stacey Bilbrey.

Bilbrey, who has participated in several youth triathlons, trained for four days a week for 2 hours at a time. He decided to take the swim after reading about Johnny Wilson, a 9-year old fourth grader who also made it across, taking just less than two hours in October 2005.

"If you were to ask me if a 7-year-old is old enough to do it, I'd say maybe one out of 10 million, but he's that one," said Bilbrey's coach, Joe Zemaitis. Zemaitis made the swim along with Bilbrey. A United States Coast Guard boat and two additional swimmers followed to take action in case an emergency occurred.

Alcatraz was formerly a Federal &lt;a href="w%3Aprison"&gt;prison&lt;/a&gt; noted for being "escape proof" while in use.

<h1>Britain expects troops out of Iraq within next 4 years</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Britain%20expects%20troops%20out%20of%20Iraq%20within%20next%204%20years&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt; says it expects all foreign combat troops to withdraw from &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; by 2010. It is the first solid statement from Britain on a firm date for troop withdrawal. &lt;a href="Tony%20Blair"&gt;Prime Minister Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; says the new &lt;a href="w%3AIraqi_National_Assembly"&gt;Iraqi national unity government&lt;/a&gt; offers "new hopes for the country."

He was speaking at a news conference with &lt;a href="Nouri%20al-Maliki"&gt;Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki&lt;/a&gt;, whose new government was sworn in on Saturday. A senior British official travelling with the prime minister, said the withdrawal of the present multinational force should be accomplished within four years. 

He told reporters that &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; hoped all but some non-combatant foreign soldiers could be withdrawn by the time of the next Iraqi election in late 2009 - provided the country moved in the right direction. "The aim is to take Iraq to a position where the &lt;a href="w%3AMultinational%20force%20in%20Iraq"&gt;multinational force&lt;/a&gt; is able to withdraw during its period in office," the official said. According to Reuters, the statement is perhaps the firmest call yet from one of the two main allies in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;-led invasion of Iraq on a date for pulling out troops. 

He said the unity government will hasten the handover of control from coalition forces back to Iraqis, allowing Britain bring some troops home by mid-year. Britain has around 7,000 troops in Iraq. Prime Minister Maliki said overall control of security in most of Iraq's 18 provinces could gradually pass into Iraqi hands by end-2006.

As violence continues across Iraq with at least 11 people killed in shootings and bomb attacks, Mr Blair said it had taken "three years of struggle" to reach the formation of a government. "It's been longer and harder than any of us would have wanted it to be but this is a new beginning," he said from Baghdad. 

The installation of Iraq's first full-term government since 2003 has forced discussion on withdrawal plans for approximately 150,000 foreign soldiers stationed there. The United States says it is too early to discuss a timetable for pulling out its 133,000 troops.

108 British military personnel have been killed in Iraq since it joined coalition in 2003. Mr Blair is expected to visit Washington this week to meet with President George W. Bush.

<h1>Montenegro secedes from Serbia</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Montenegro%20secedes%20from%20Serbia&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

After a referendum, the Montenegro region of &lt;a href="w%3ASerbia%20and%20Montenegro"&gt;Serbia and Montenegro&lt;/a&gt; declares independence to form the new &lt;a href="w%3AMontenegro"&gt;Republic of Montenegro&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike other Balkan states such as Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia, Montenegro has achieved independence without violence. "I am convinced Montenegro could be the next country from this region to join the European Union, after Romania, Bulgaria and Croatia, which are further along the process," says Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AMilo%20Djukanovic"&gt;Milo Djukanovic&lt;/a&gt;, who has promoted Montenegro's independence. It is also predicted that Montenegro will join the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; in September.

The referendum, with an 86.3% voter turnout, had a 55.4% approval for the secession, which satisfies the European Union's minimum 55% approval. With a population of 650,000, Montenegro is the world's newest country. &lt;a href="w%3ASerbia"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt; reluctantly agreed to the split, and the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; approved. Despite expectations, there were no riots that night; however, early celebrations had occurred in the capital Podgorica based off of expected results.

This is the first time Montenegro has been independent since 1916, when it became a part of Austro-Hungary. In 1918 Montenegro merged with Serbia. Soon Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia together formed "Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenians", which later changed the name into Kingdom Yugoslavia. In 1945. Yugoslavia became a communist state. In 1991 and 1992 four of six Yugoslavian republics declared independence but two, Serbia and Montenegro, remained together.

Some analysts note that Serbia and Montenegro has not functioned as one state since the Belgrade agreement, signed three years ago. Each republic had separate anthems, laws, and currencies and their joint parliament did not meet very often.

Plans to restart the &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Ireland%20Assembly"&gt;Northern Ireland Assembly&lt;/a&gt; failed today as the controversial &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Unionist%20Party"&gt;Democratic Unionist Party&lt;/a&gt; leader and Protestant evangelist &lt;a href="w%3AIan%20Paisley"&gt;Ian Paisley&lt;/a&gt; rejected the nomination by &lt;a href="w%3ASinn%20Fein"&gt;Sinn Fein&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AGerry%20Adams"&gt;Gerry Adams&lt;/a&gt; for him to be &lt;a href="w%3AFirst%20Minister%20of%20Northern%20Ireland"&gt;First Minister&lt;/a&gt; of a new &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Ireland%20Executive"&gt;Northern Ireland Executive&lt;/a&gt;. Gerry Adams nominated his colleague, &lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20McGuinness"&gt;Martin McGuinness&lt;/a&gt;, the deputy leader of Sinn Fein to be the Deputy First Minister. 

Britain restarted a shadow version of the Assembly last week for the first time in 3 1/2 years to form a power sharing &lt;a href="w%3Ahome%20rule"&gt;home rule&lt;/a&gt; government made up Catholics and Protestants by a November 24 as directed by the &lt;a href="w%3ABelfast%20Agreement"&gt;Belfast Agreement&lt;/a&gt;. However, accusations of a spy ring lead to the suspension of the Assembly and &lt;a href="w%3Adirect%20rule"&gt;direct rule&lt;/a&gt; from London was reinstated in 2002. 

Adams rose to his feet and uttered the following "I want to move that Iain Paisley be returned as First Minister and Martin McGuinness be returned as Deputy First Minister on the restoration of devolved government," in Gaelic before translating it for the rest of the Assembly to understand.

After being asked by Speaker &lt;a href="w%3AEileen%20Bell"&gt;Eileen Bell&lt;/a&gt;, "Dr. Paisley, do you accept the nomination as first minister on restoration of a devolved government?" 

Paisley rejected the nomination instantly stating "Certainly not, madam! And I think it goes without saying that the reasons are known well throughout this province, and they've been endorsed by the majority of unionist voters."

Paisley further more stated, "Are we going to have in the government of Northern Ireland those who are terrorists, those that condoned and even planned murders, who robbed banks, who committed criminal acts and who will not support the police?" The DUP will not support Sinn Fein until the &lt;a href="w%3AIrish%20Republican%20Army"&gt;Irish Republican Army&lt;/a&gt; disbands, renounces crime and Sinn Fein accepts the &lt;a href="w%3APolice%20Service%20of%20Northern%20Ireland"&gt;Police Service of Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, something it has refused to do for decades during the time of the &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Ulster%20Constabulary"&gt;Royal Ulster Constabulary&lt;/a&gt;.

The United States Special Envoy to Northern Ireland, &lt;a href="w%3AMitchell%20Reiss"&gt;Mitchell Reiss&lt;/a&gt;, stated "We need to start getting on with business, talking to each other, trying to work out some of the problems today, not leaving them until the last minute."

The Assembly has adjourned until Tuesday.

&lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Costello"&gt;Peter Costello&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; treasurer and the man most likely to succeed &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;Liberal party&lt;/a&gt; leader has thrown his support behind a nuclear power industry in Australia.

Mr Costello said that when nuclear power generation becomes economically viable, Australia should pursue its use. "If it becomes commercial, we should have it. That is, there's no in-principle objection to nuclear energy" Mr Costello said.

Mr Costello said that nuclear energy was clean and safe, provided waste was dealt with. "Nuclear energy is an efficient form of energy. Provided you deal properly with the waste, then it's safe,"

"It has much less greenhouse emissions than coal." Mr Costello said.

Long time environmentalist and &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Labor party&lt;/a&gt; member for Kingsford Smith, &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Garrett"&gt;Peter Garrett&lt;/a&gt; said that the government were only discussing nuclear energy to cover up its inaction on climate change.

"When really, when you look seriously at what is going on here, Australia needs to make a decision about why we are not addressing climate change and find those necessary alternatives that will make up the energy mix" he said.

Mr Garrett said that it was a "farce" that PM Howard leaves the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; and suddenly becomes pro-nuclear. "It's more than hypocritical, it's a farce for the Prime Minister to come back from America and suddenly become born again for nukes" he said.

Federal Environment Minister, Ian Campbell rejected Mr Garrett's claims that the government has ignored climate change and renewable energy, but said that nuclear power needed to be considered. He denied that the debate on nuclear power is a cover-up.

"We need to look at all of the options, not have this false debate about renewables versus coal or coal versus nuclear" he said.

"We need everything and we need to do it very well and that's how we will secure Australia's future." Mr Campbell said.

The federal opposition's environment spokesperson, &lt;a href="Anthony%20Albanese"&gt;Anthony Albanese&lt;/a&gt; said today that Mr Howard's viewws were stuck in the past and were not in the best interests of Australia.

However, Mr Albanese said Mr Howard's views were retrospective and not in Australia's best interest.

“This is classic John Howard whether it be the GST, whether it be the extreme industrial relations agenda, or whether it be this nuclear fantasy which will become Australia's nightmare – John Howard always returns to the past” Mr Albanese said.

“For John Howard to say that there hasn't been a debate on nuclear energy would suggest that he went to sleep in the 50s and he's just woken up.” 

Mr Albanese claims that the high cost and safety concerns surrounding nuclear energy outweighed any benefits. “The problems of cost, safety, waste disposals and nuclear proliferation in the climate of terrorism are more acute today than they've ever been.” he said.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Malaysian%20Home%20Ministry%20ban%20approved%20documentary&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Malaysian documentary &lt;a href="http%3A//www.redfilms.com.my/lelakikomunis.htm"&gt;The Last Communist&lt;/a&gt; was passed without cuts by the National Film Censorship board in March. Ten days before it was supposed to start screening, the Home Ministry retracted the approval. 

The film made its world debut at the &lt;a href="w%3ABerlin%20Film%20Festival"&gt;Berlin Film Festival&lt;/a&gt; 2006 without filmmaker Amir Muhammed in attendance. It also appeared at the &lt;a href="w%3ASeattle%20International%20Film%20Festival"&gt;Seattle International Film Festival&lt;/a&gt; 2006 and the &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Film%20Festival"&gt;London Film Festival&lt;/a&gt; 2006. It has been reviewed favorably in &lt;a href="w%3AVariety%20%28magazine%29"&gt;Variety&lt;/a&gt; and UK's &lt;a href="w%3ASight%20%26amp%3B%20Sound"&gt;Sight &amp; Sound&lt;/a&gt;. Sight &amp; Sound called the film an "essayistic delight" and of Amir Muhammed "the only visible heir to the &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Marker"&gt;Chris Marker&lt;/a&gt; tradition."

The ban comes after &lt;a href="w%3ABerita%20Harian"&gt;Berita Harian&lt;/a&gt;, a conservative Malay daily, printed a series of articles critical of the film and the Censorship board. In the first article, the reporters ask government ministers and professors to comment on the impact of the film. The response is wholly negative.

Home Minister Datuk Seri Mohd Radzi Sheikh Ahmad issued a retraction of the approval on May 5, 2006. Deputy Minister Datuk Tan Chai Ho described the reasons behind the ban as, "the public was not very happy about the movie."

Neither the Berita Harian journalists nor their sources had seen the full movie. The article misstates that the film glorifies "the communist leader" when Chin Peng is mentioned only once throughout the film. 

At the request of opposition Parliamentary leader &lt;a href="w%3ALim%20Kit%20Siang"&gt;Lim Kit Siang&lt;/a&gt;, the documentary was screened for ministers of Parliament. Culture, Arts and Heritage Minister Datuk Seri Dr Rais Yatim said, "The plot isn't controversial and there's nothing that could be deemed as offensive from the cultural viewpoint." Lim Kit Siang called the movie, "an eye opener for all".

On Monday, 22nd May, Radzi announced that in the annual meeting of the UMNO supreme council, in June, the government is scheduled to decide whether to keep the ban on the film, or let the people decide.

At the time of the ban, Radzi had not seen the film either.

&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; Police, on Monday arrested and charged two people in separate simultaneous raids in Northern NSW. The raids follow an investigation into &lt;a href="w%3ACannabis"&gt;cannabis&lt;/a&gt; supply by Strike Force Bayan.

Police conducted three separate raids simultaneously around 7:30 p.m. on properties in Mullaway, &lt;a href="w%3AWoolgoolga%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Woolgoolga&lt;/a&gt; and Halfway Creek, all just North of &lt;a href="w%3ACoffs%20Harbour%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Coffs Harbour&lt;/a&gt; on the NSW North Coast.

Police claim to have seized &lt;a href="w%3AAUD"&gt;AUD&lt;/a&gt; $400,000 worth of cannabis at a property in Mullaway and have arrested and charged a 35 year-old man with drug possession.

The other person caught by the operation was a 46 year-old woman at the Woolgoolga property. She was charged with supplying &lt;a href="w%3ACocaine"&gt;cocaine&lt;/a&gt;.

Police found a large amount of cannabis and money at the Halfway Creek property but are yet to lay charges over the discovery.

Back in December 2000, a Alcohol and Other Drug Sector Agency Forum discovered that the rate of cannabis use among young people in the Coffs Harbour area was particularly high and that many cannabis users come from families where parents and even grandparents use the drug.

The 20-year-old will appear in Dunedin Court this afternoon.

Her baby was born in the early hours of Saturday, &lt;a href="w%3AMay%2020"&gt;May 20&lt;/a&gt;. The mother was taken to hospital on the same day about 2:30 p.m. because her friends were concerned about her health, she was suffering from &lt;a href="w%3Ainternal%20bleeding"&gt;internal bleeding&lt;/a&gt;. It was later discovered that she had given birth. The baby was found at around 11 p.m. at Studholme College, which was where she was staying.

They interviewed the mother and performed an autopsy on the baby.

Detective Senior Sergeant Tony Wakelin says: "She's obviously quite traumatised still. Physically she's recovering well, but she's got a long way to go psychologically."

Police would not comment on the case any further since the case is now before the courts.

<h1>Global warming underestimated, say scientists</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Global%20warming%20underestimated%2C%20say%20scientists&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Some scientists say current &lt;a href="w%3Aclimate%20change"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt; estimates may be significantly underestimating the potential scale of &lt;a href="w%3Aglobal%20warming"&gt;global warming&lt;/a&gt;. The team of researchers report that the actual warming due to human fossil fuel emissions could be 15 percent to 78 percent higher than estimates that fail to take into account the feedback mechanism which involves carbon dioxide and Earth temperature.

&lt;a href="w%3AGreenhouse%20gases"&gt;Greenhouse gases&lt;/a&gt; are believed to contribute to global warming, yet scientists have said that global warming itself triggers greenhouse gas emissions - meaning that the Earth may get hotter faster than climate models predict.

Another team of researchers in &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, has reported a similar conclusion: "when the Earth has warmed up in the past, due to the sun's natural cycles, more greenhouse gases have been spewed into the atmosphere. As greenhouse gas levels rose, so did the Earth's temperature," the scientists reported.

Dr Margaret Torn of &lt;a href="w%3ALawrence%20Berkeley%20National%20Laboratory"&gt;Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; said: "It means the warming is happening faster, each decade is actually warming faster than it would have," Dr Torn said. "It's the pace of change that will be one of the big problems. It's how humans adapt and the cost that will depend on the rate of change of climate."

Over the past 30 years, the Earth has warmed by 0.6 degrees Celsius, &lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; has reported. Over the past 100 years, it has warmed by 0.8 degrees C, indicating a recent acceleration in warmth. Current climate models predict temperature increases of 1.5 to 4.5 degrees Celsius, but the California team realised that additional carbon dioxide caused by the natural solar cycle may elevate these estimates.

Taking this information on board could mean temperature increases of 1.6 to 6 degrees Celsius - and the higher temperatures are more likely, they said in a statement. 

Meanwhile, another group of leading US scientists has linked global warming to the recent increase in hurricane intensity. They warn that humans must develop cleaner energy and transportation immediately - or bear the risk of more extreme storms.

"One is faced with repeating history, of putting up with $200 billion worth of damage every so often," said Dr. Peter Webster, a professor at the &lt;a href="w%3AGeorgia%20Institute%20of%20Technology"&gt;Georgia Institute of Technology&lt;/a&gt; and author of a 2005 study that found the strength and duration of hurricanes has doubled in the last 50 years. "I’m not sure how many $200 billion the country can afford," he told journalists.

Lawrence Berkeley's Dr Torn said humans are the biggest unknown: "To predict the future, you have to guess how much CO2 levels will go up. That depends on the biggest uncertainty of all - what humans decide to do. Do we get smart and prevent CO2 emissions? Do we continue with business as usual? Or will we end up somewhere in between?"

Forecasters with the &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Hurricane%20Center"&gt;National Hurricane Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMiami"&gt;Miami&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; predict that up to ten &lt;a href="hurricane"&gt;hurricane&lt;/a&gt;s will form in the North &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;Atlantic&lt;/span&gt; this hurricane season, and that up to six of them will be considered "major." The hurricane center also predicts that from 13 to 16 "named" storms this season (i.e. of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Atropical%20storm"&gt;tropical storm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; strength or greater, with winds in excess of 39 mph or 62 km/h.)

A major hurricane, as defined by the National Hurricane Center, is one that rates Category 3 or above on the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASaffir-Simpson%20scale"&gt;Saffir-Simpson scale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , with sustained winds of 111 mph (179 km/h) or more.

Conrad Lautenbacher, administrator of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Oceanic%20and%20Atmospheric%20Administration"&gt;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , says that warmer ocean temperatures and low &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Awind%20shear"&gt;wind shear&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; make conditions favorable for hurricane development. Although it is too soon to predict how many storms will make landfall, Lautenbacher says that it is possible that two to four hurricanes could affect the United States.

According to NOAA, the Atlantic basin has been in an active period since 1995, with nine of the past eleven seasons with above average storm activity. Max Mayfield, directory of the National Hurricane Center, said, "the research is telling us we are in an active period that may last 20 years, and that's not good news. So the message is clear: We need to be prepared." 

"It takes just one hurricane over your house to make for a bad year," said Mayfield.

Last year, 28 named storms developed into 15 hurricanes, of which seven were major. The hurricane center had predicted five major hurricanes out of nine total hurricanes that year. Five hurricanes (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Dennis"&gt;Dennis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Katrina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Rita"&gt;Rita&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Stan"&gt;Stan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Wilma"&gt;Wilma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) were so destructive that the World Meteorological Organization retired their names.

The North Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to November 30.

When &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; speaks to &lt;a href="w%3AIreland"&gt;Ireland's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADail"&gt;Dail&lt;/a&gt; (lower house) later today Irish Time up to six members will not be in attendance to protest Australia's involvement in the &lt;a href="w%3A2003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq"&gt;invasion of Iraq&lt;/a&gt;.

Joe Higgins, one of the members who will dissent from parliament for Mr Howard's speech called him a xenophobe and warmonger. "I would describe him as xenophobic, as a warmonger, as an anti-trade union representative of Australian and indeed world big business," he said.

Mr Howard said that the boycott plans were an example of democracy at work. "Well, I would say to them, isn't it terrific to celebrate the joy of democracy? And part of the joy of democracy is the right to peaceful and lawful dissent," Mr Howard said.

"The Irish brought many things to Australia and one of them was dissent. So they are living exemplars of that Irish spirit, God bless them," Mr Howard said.

It is the first time Mr Howard has visited Ireland as Australia's Prime Minister. Mr Howard was last in Ireland in 1986, when he was leader of the opposition.

Mr Howard's visit has also encouraged predictions about the 2007 Australian general election.

Two community leaders in Ireland have said they expect Mr Howard to secure a fifth term in office when Australia goes to the polls in 2007. University College Dublin president Hugh Brady said that he had been told by his sources that Mr Howard was expected to return to office next year.

Eugene McCague, the Dublin Chamber of Commerce president, followed Mr Brady's comments, telling a group of business people that Mr Howard could share some advice with Irish Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Bertie Ahern. There will also be an election next year in Ireland and Mr Ahern will be seeking a third term in office.

"I hope if you have a few moments, the Taoiseach could take an opportunity to ask and learn from you what are the secrets of winning three general elections in a row, or indeed in your case four general elections in a row" Mr McCague said.

"And I also suspect he might like to understand what the secret is of somebody whose party members are clamouring for him to lead them into a fifth general election in a row."

An internal government committee has been created to look at Australia's &lt;a href="w%3Anuclear%20power"&gt;nuclear energy&lt;/a&gt; role. The &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20government"&gt;Federal Government&lt;/a&gt; has admitted it has set up a "secret committee" to examine the economics and science of nuclear power. During a &lt;a href="w%3ASenate%20estimates%20committee"&gt;Senate estimates committee&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Prime%20Minister%20and%20Cabinet"&gt;Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet's&lt;/a&gt; deputy secretary, Duncan Lewis confirmed that the committee had been formed following statements by &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;US President George W Bush&lt;/a&gt; to create a global nuclear energy partnership. He told the Senate estimates that the committee would effectively try to develop an &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n perspective on the American proposal.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Labor Opposition&lt;/a&gt; environment spokesman, &lt;a href="Anthony%20Albanese"&gt;Anthony Albanese&lt;/a&gt;, says the information has not been made public because of the sensitivity of the issue. "This hasn't been announced, the work's been done behind-the-scenes because the Government knows that this is indeed a very dangerous path for Australia to go on," he said.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Greens"&gt;Greens Senator Christine Milne&lt;/a&gt; said that the establishment of a secret committee to look at nuclear power was deeply troubling: "Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard%2C%20politician"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; says he wants a full public debate on whether Australia should adopt nuclear power, yet his government has set up a secret committee to examine the matter," Senator Milne said.

"The latest evidence about climate change supports the Greens' position that nuclear power is no solution to climate change, as the government claims. As well as being dangerous it is too slow to mobilise," Senator Milne said in a media release.

&lt;a href="w%3ALyn%20Allison"&gt;Democrats Leader Lyn Allison&lt;/a&gt; says it is extraordinary that the Government did not make the details of the committee public. "It's very clear... that we're looking here at a very secret, narrow and possibly a biased inquiry," she said. "If that's where it is going, in fact we'll be moving as soon as we can to establish a Senate inquiry into this, we think it needs to be open, it needs to be public." Senator Allison said in a media release that Howard's push for nuclear power "is greed and glow in the dark politics..." 

"The Government has no plan for power generation into the future that doesn't add to greenhouse emissions or produce intractable waste. The enrichment process is energy-intensive and Australia is already the world's highest per capita greenhouse gas emitter. We cannot afford another energy guzzling industry, especially when this government has abandoned renewable energy," she said. "Enriching uranium concentrates the isotopes making the uranium more hazardous, more polluting, and makes Australia a greater target for nuclear terrorism."

Senator Milne said on the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Democrats"&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt; website: "Australians want leadership on this issue, not knee jerk reactions to what George Bush thinks is a good idea. They want a debate that isn't set up to merely justify selling enriched uranium and nuclear power."

Anthony Albanese says John Howard's push for a nuclear energy debate would become "Australia's nightmare." Mr Albanese said Mr Howard's views were retrospective and not in Australia's best interests: "This is classic John Howard whether it be the GST, whether it be the extreme industrial relations agenda, or whether it be this nuclear fantasy which will become Australia's nightmare – John Howard always returns to the past," Mr Albanese said in a News Limited article. 

"For John Howard to say that there hasn't been a debate on nuclear energy would suggest that he went to sleep in the 50s and he's just woken up." Mr Albanese said the dangers and costs of nuclear energy outweighed the energy benefits. "The problems of cost, safety, waste disposals and nuclear proliferation in the climate of terrorism are more acute today than they've ever been."

<h2>Nuclear power sites for east coast?</h2>
Meanwhile a new study by the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia%20Institute"&gt;Australia Institute&lt;/a&gt; has identified several areas on Australia's east coast, where nuclear power plants could be built if the Howard Government decide to take the nuclear energy path. The Australia Institute say they have consulted experts who say that the plant will need to be located on the coast, near transmission lines and be near a major centre with good rail and port access.

The institute's Dr Clive Hamilton said the area south of &lt;a href="w%3AWollongong"&gt;Wollongong&lt;/a&gt;, the central coast of &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3ASunshine%20coast"&gt;Sunshine Coast&lt;/a&gt; and other areas in &lt;a href="w%3AQueensland"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AVictoria"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt; would be ideal. "You can't have a nuclear industry without specifying where the nuclear power plants are likely to be," he said. "We're really taking up the Prime Minister's challenge to have a debate about nuclear power in Australia. We want to make it an honest debate and to start talking about where you would put the nuclear power plants if they were to be built." 

Dr Hamilton suggests the nuclear debate barely touched the surface. "Wherever a nuclear power plant is built in Australia, some people aren't going to like it, that's just an inevitability," he said. "I think if we're going to have a serious nuclear debate rather than just a false debate then we need to start to talk about the reality of building nuclear power plants which, in the end, comes down to location."

Israeli troops have captured Ibrahim Hamad, the leader of the military wing of the Islamic Group &lt;a href="w%3AHamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt; in the West Bank town of &lt;a href="w%3ARamallah"&gt;Ramallah&lt;/a&gt;. Israel accuses the 41-year-old Hamad (who has headed the Izzedine al- Qasam brigades in the West Bank since 2003) of masterminding a string of suicide bombings including attacks on cafes and universities in &lt;a href="w%3AJerusalem"&gt;Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt;. Hamas, which has launched some of the biggest attacks against Israel, declared an informal truce 15 months ago. Since then, Hamas also won the &lt;a href="w%3APalestinian%20legislative%20election%2C%202006"&gt;palestinian parliamentary elections&lt;/a&gt; in January of this year.

The raid (which was executed early this morning) involved Israeli troops, jeeps and a bulldozer. Eye-witnesses say the soldiers surrounded a row of shops in which Hamad was hiding and threatened to demolish the building if he did not come out. The bulldozer then proceeded to ram the iron doors of the shops, after which Hamad emerged and surrendered. The Israeli troops then ordered him to strip to make sure he was unarmed. After this, he was arrested and taken away in his underwear. 

Hamad had been wanted by Israel since 1998, he was arrested by the Palestinian Authority but was released in 2002 during a major Israeli offensive in the West Bank. The BBC's correspondent in Jerusalem, Caroline Hawley says it is not clear why Israel moved against Hamad since Hamas has not carried out any attacks for over a year. Israeli operations in the past few months have been concentrated against the more active group &lt;a href="w%3APalestinian%20Islamic%20Jihad%20Movement"&gt;Palestinian Islamic Jihad&lt;/a&gt;.

Yiannis Papageorgiou a spokesman for the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHellenic%20Air%20Force"&gt;Greek Air Force&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; says that the Greek F-16 was dispatched to intercept and identify the Turkish plane that according to Papageorgiou was violating the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAthens"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Flight Information Region, when the two planes collided.

The Greek Defense Ministry said earlier "the planes collided during interception manoeuvres above Karpathos. We don’t know what has happened to the Greek pilot yet." A passing merchant ship rescued the Turkish pilot, Halil Ibrahim Ozdemir, who refused to be rescued by Greek frogmen. The Greek pilot was killed in the incident.

Vecdi Gonul, Defense Minister for the Turkish government released a partial statement saying, "we’re still waiting for definite information and our Chief of Staff is speaking to the Greek Chief of Staff."

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AA%C3%A9rospatiale%20Puma"&gt;Puma helicopters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as well as rescue personnel have been dispatched to the area.

When the event became known, Turkish Foreign Minister, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAbdullah%20G%C3%BCl"&gt;Abdullah Gül&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; communicated immediately with his counterpart, Dora Bakoyiannis in order to have a first conversation regarding the fighter planes' crash. 

Both countries &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAegean%20dispute"&gt;disagree on the boundaries&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of their airspace over the sea and fighters sometimes conduct mock dogfights in the area between the two countries.

The &lt;a href="w%3ASenator%20Ian%20Campbell"&gt;Australian Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Ian Campbell&lt;/a&gt;, has praised supermarket shoppers and operators for cutting three billion plastic bags from circulation during the past two years. He said a report compiled by the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20National%20Retailers%20Association"&gt;Australian National Retailers Association&lt;/a&gt;, representing major supermarkets, showed that by the end of last year supermarkets had reduced their annual use of lightweight, single-use bags by 45 per cent compared with 2002.

"This is an enormous achievement by shoppers and supermarket management and a clear demonstration of a behavioural change by thousands of Australians," Senator Campbell said. "The cutback means fewer bags in the litter stream. The goal must be to stop plastic bags getting into the litter stream and spoiling Australia’s environment." 

The Senator says the result came from entirely voluntary action – "no regulations, no levies or additional costs to shoppers. I am delighted that the major supermarkets are committed to achieving the 50 per cent goal by the end of this year. I also share their view that development of a viable degradable bag to replace existing lightweight plastic ones is a key to achieving further significant reductions."

Plastics have been widely used in Australia in the past few decades but environmentalists say plastic bags have had a devastating impact on the nation's natural environment. According to &lt;a href="w%3AClean%20Up%20Australia"&gt;Clean Up Australia&lt;/a&gt; plastic bags can take between 20 and 1000 years to break down. Despite their recyclable nature, an estimated 6.67 billion or 36,700 tonnes of plastic bags are disposed of in landfill sites throughout Australia each year.

Many thousands of marine mammals and seabirds die every year around the world as a result of plastic litter. A 2004 NSW Parliamentary paper reported that plastic bags are of "significant concern in the marine and aquatic environment, as aquatic life can be threatened through entanglement, suffocation and ingestion." The then Federal Environment Minister was reported as saying: "All environmental ministers believe that all plastic bags should be phased out within five years. If this voluntary campaign isn’t working then of course we have to consider what to do (next)…."
