&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Party%20supporting%20Scottish%20independence%20from%20UK%20wins%20elections&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The &lt;a href="w%3AScottish%20National%20Party"&gt;Scottish National Party&lt;/a&gt; (SNP), which supports &lt;a href="Scotland"&gt;Scottish&lt;/a&gt; independence from the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;, has pulled off a historic, albeit narrow, victory in yesterday's &lt;a href="w%3AScottish%20Parliament%20election%2C%202007"&gt;Scottish elections&lt;/a&gt;.

In the third Scottish election since the opening of the &lt;a href="w%3AParliament%20of%20Scotland"&gt;Scottish Parliament&lt;/a&gt; in 1999, the left of centre SNP beat the ruling &lt;a href="w%3AScottish%20Labour%20Party"&gt;Labour Party&lt;/a&gt; by a single seat. It won 47 seats, while Labour won 46, down from the current 50.

It is the first time since the parliament opened that Labour has been beaten, and the first time in fifty years that they have not had a majority of Scottish constituency seats in any election.

SNP leader &lt;a href="Alex%20Salmond"&gt;Alex Salmond&lt;/a&gt; declared: "Scotland has changed for good and forever." He added that the Labour Party had "lost the moral authority to govern Scotland."

The current &lt;a href="w%3AFirst%20Minister%20of%20Scotland"&gt;First Minister of Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJack%20McConnell"&gt;Jack McConnell&lt;/a&gt; of Labour said: "While I recognise that the SNP are the largest party by the narrowest of margins, Alex Salmond must himself recognise that he does not have a majority in the Scottish Parliament or anywhere near a majority of the vote."

It is believed that many factors caused the Labour vote to slump and the SNP vote to rise, including the &lt;a href="Iraq%20War"&gt;war in Iraq&lt;/a&gt; and the renewal of &lt;a href="w%3AUK%20Trident%20program"&gt;Trident&lt;/a&gt;, which are both unpopular in Scotland.

The election also raises a serious dilemma for the Labour party's &lt;a href="w%3AGordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt;, a Scotsman widely tipped to succeed &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; as the next prime minister of the United Kingdom. Brown is vehement in his support of the Union, and is a &lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20of%20Commons"&gt;Westminster&lt;/a&gt; (London parliament) MP for &lt;a href="w%3AKirkcaldy"&gt;Kirkcaldy&lt;/a&gt;. An SNP government in Scotland will find itself facing the very Labour party it beat in power in London. 

Turnout was up 2% on the last Scottish election.

<h2>Controversy</h2>
The election was highly controversial, not least for having three separate systems, running in tandem -

<ul>
BULLET::::- A constituency vote, which was "&lt;a href="w%3Afirst%20past%20the%20post"&gt;first past the post&lt;/a&gt;", and for a candidate.
BULLET::::- A regional list vote, which was &lt;a href="w%3Aadditional%20member%20system"&gt;additional member system&lt;/a&gt;, and was for a party.
BULLET::::- A local authority (council) vote, which was &lt;a href="w%3ASingle%20Transferable%20Vote"&gt;Single Transferable Vote&lt;/a&gt;, and in which parties could field more than one candidate in a ward.

</ul>
The three systems, along with difficulties with electronic counting meant that maybe as many as one hundred thousand ballot papers were "spoiled". In addition, there was also huge problems with the postal vote.

Due to the extensive computer problems, votes had to be cancelled early on Friday morning, and postponed to later in the day.

Many other problems beset the election, with a helicopter from the &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20Isles%20%28Scottish%20Parliament%20constituency%29"&gt;Western Isles&lt;/a&gt; constituency being held up by fog, and a boat carrying ballot papers from the &lt;a href="w%3AIsle%20of%20Arran"&gt;Isle of Arran&lt;/a&gt;, breaking down in the &lt;a href="w%3AFirth%20of%20Clyde"&gt;Firth of Clyde&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Other parties</h2>
In addition to the SNP and Labour, the other parties results' were as follows -

<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="w%3AScottish%20Conservative%20Party"&gt;Conservative and Unionist&lt;/a&gt; - 17 members.
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="w%3AScottish%20Liberal%20Democrats"&gt;Liberal Democrats&lt;/a&gt; - 16 members.
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="w%3AScottish%20Green%20Party"&gt;Scottish Greens&lt;/a&gt; - 2 members.
BULLET::::- Independent - 1 (&lt;a href="w%3AMargo%20MacDonald"&gt;Margo MacDonald&lt;/a&gt;, formerly of the SNP)

</ul>
The &lt;a href="w%3AScottish%20Socialist%20Party"&gt;Scottish Socialist Party&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASolidarity%20%28Scotland%29"&gt;Solidarity&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AScottish%20Senior%20Citizens%20Unity%20Party"&gt;Scottish Senior Citizens Unity Party&lt;/a&gt; were all wiped out.

In order to establish a majority in the Scottish Parliament, the SNP must form a coalition with one or more of these parties. The Liberal Democrats, who were in coalition with the Labour party in the first two terms of the Scottish parliament, are a possibility.

Other parties that campaigned for seats in &lt;a href="Holyrood"&gt;Holyrood&lt;/a&gt; included the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom%20Independence%20Party"&gt;United Kingdom Independence Party&lt;/a&gt; (UKIP), the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20National%20Party"&gt;British National Party&lt;/a&gt; (BNP), the &lt;a href="w%3AScottish%20Unionist%20Party%20%28modern%29"&gt;Scottish Unionist Party&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3ASocialist%20Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Scottish Socialist Labour Party&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20Peoples%20Alliance"&gt;Christian Peoples Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AScottish%20Christian%20Party"&gt;Scottish Christian Party&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Gains and losses</h2>
The Scottish National Party, while not gaining the landslide it had wished for, made breakthroughs in &lt;a href="w%3AGlasgow"&gt;Glasgow&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AGlasgow%20Govan%20%28Scottish%20Parliament%20constituency"&gt;Govan&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="w%3AEdinburgh"&gt;Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AEdinburgh%20East%20and%20Musselburgh%20%28Scottish%20Parliament%20constituency%29"&gt;Edinburgh East&lt;/a&gt;) and also took both seats in &lt;a href="w%3ADundee"&gt;Dundee&lt;/a&gt;.

The Liberal Democrats gained seats in &lt;a href="w%3ADunfermline%20West%20%28Scottish%20Parliament%20constituency%29"&gt;Dunfermline West&lt;/a&gt;, but their losses mean the number of seats they hold is unchanged.

<h2>Wales and England</h2>
While the Scottish election was going on, the Welsh were also having their &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Assembly%20for%20Wales%20election%2C%202007"&gt;election&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Assembly%20for%20Wales"&gt;Welsh Assembly&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3APlaid%20Cymru"&gt;Plaid Cymru&lt;/a&gt; gained a seat from Labour at &lt;a href="w%3ALlanelli%20%28National%20Assembly%20for%20Wales%20constituency%29"&gt;Llanelli&lt;/a&gt;. The Conservatives had their best showing since the Assembly began.

The final results show that the membership for the new assembly will be:- 

Labour 26 -4
Plaid Cymru 15 +3
Conservatives 12 +1
Liberal Democrats 6 -
Independent 1 -

In England, the elections were more minor, dealing only with local authorities. However they can be an important indicator of how battleground seats might go in the General Election, expected in 2-3 years time. The Conservatives made the greatest gains, but did not make the breakthrough in Northern England that they would have hoped. The Liberal Democrats did not make the advances that they had hoped, and stayed at more or less the same level. Elsewhere, &lt;a href="w%3ACornwall"&gt;Cornish regionalists&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMebyon%20Kernow"&gt;Mebyon Kernow&lt;/a&gt; gained an extra seat bringing their total to seven, and the &lt;a href="w%3AEuroscepticism"&gt;Eurosceptic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom%20Independence%20Party"&gt;United Kingdom Independence Party&lt;/a&gt; (UKIP) and &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20%28UK%2C%201989%29"&gt;Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt; (not to be confused with the Liberal Democrats) gained seats in several areas of England.

<h3>Manitoba Hells Angels member found guilty of nine charges</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3AManitoba"&gt;Manitoba&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AHells%20Angels"&gt;Hells Angels&lt;/a&gt; member Ian Grant, who was convicted of nine charges including drug trafficking, was found guilty today. Grant, 32, faces his sentence later in the year. Those convicted of drug trafficking face life imprisonment and those convicted of organized crime face 14 years in jail. He was released by a judge in 2004 for a lack of evidence. Twelve Hells Angels including Grant were arrested in February 2006 for drug related crimes.

A &lt;a href="w%3ACalgary"&gt;Calgary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAlberta"&gt;Alberta&lt;/a&gt; man was taken into custody after he started a four-hour standoff at city hall, Saturday afternoon. Downtown streets and the building were evacuated as a precaution. Police brought in tactical squads and dog teams. 

The police were called at 4:00 p.m. and the man surrendered to police at approximately 8:30 p.m. The 26-year-old man claimed to be carrying explosives but police say he was only carrying a &lt;a href="w%3Apellet%20gun"&gt;pellet gun&lt;/a&gt;. They also say he was part of a "domestic family issue" and "a court finding that affected him". He faces charges for uttering threats and claiming possession of weapons in public.

<h3>Quebec multiculturalism group demanded apology</h3>

♡❤Quebec Pluriel♡❤, a local multi-culturalism group, raised a human-rights complaint about an "offensive" video showing a black person depicted as a &lt;a href="w%3Acannibal"&gt;cannibal&lt;/a&gt;. The video entitled, ♡❤Le cannibale♡❤, posted on comedy website ♡❤Têtes à claques♡❤, shows a black person being yelled at for eating two white people in a pot of boiling water. A woman calls him &lt;a href="w%3AKunta%20Kinte"&gt;Kunta Kinte&lt;/a&gt;, a famous black slave.

"It is inconceivable that a name like Kunta Kinte would be associated to a cannibal," said vice-president of ♡❤Quebec Pluriel♡❤, Lydie Olga Ntap. "It's unacceptable."

The group demanded video sponsors Salambo Productions and &lt;a href="w%3ABell%20Canada"&gt;Bell Canada&lt;/a&gt; to apologise. The companies refused saying it was only humour.

&lt;a href="w%3AManouchehr%20Mottaki"&gt;Manouchehr Mottaki&lt;/a&gt;, the foreign minsister of &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;, did not attend a dinner at &lt;a href="w%3ASharm%20el-Sheikh"&gt;Sharm el-Sheikh&lt;/a&gt; because the red dress of a &lt;a href="w%3AUkrainians"&gt;Ukrainian&lt;/a&gt; violinist did not meet the "&lt;a href="Islamic"&gt;Islamic&lt;/a&gt; standards." According to Mottaki, "There was something wrong with that so I offered my apologies. There was no other reason." 

The planned discussion of &lt;a href="Condoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; and Mottaki would have been the highest-level formal talks of U.S. and Iranian officials. It was intended to enable the foreign ministers to thrash out ways to curb the security problems in Iraq.

State Department spokesman Sean McCormack explained the issue in term of intimidation when he said, "I don't know which woman he was afraid of, the woman in the red dress or the secretary of state." 

In lieu of a longer substantive discussion, there was a 3-minute exchange of pleasantries between Rice and Mottaki at the end. However, Rice did have a complete discussion with Walid Moallem, the foreign minister of Syria, to alleviate Iraq's security problems.

Later, Mottaki stated that Iran believes that the presence of American troops is the source of instability and called for the withdrawal of American troops. He said, "The U.S. must issue a clear troop-withdrawal plan so that peace and stability can be restored."

According to Mottaki,

&lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;n authorities are conducting tests on samples taken from a suspected &lt;a href="w%3Abird%20flu"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt; patient who died on Thursday, May 5. The 26-year-old poultry trader from Sukoharjo, &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Java"&gt;Central Java&lt;/a&gt;, died after being hospitalized for three days. If confirmed, this will be the 95th case of human &lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt; infection in Indonesia.

The Indonesian daily ♡❤Suara Merdeka♡❤ reports that, in addition to high fever, the victim's symptoms included &lt;a href="w%3Abronchitis"&gt;bronchitis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aencephalitis"&gt;encephalitis&lt;/a&gt; (inflammation of the brain). Encephalitis has been reported in other H5N1 cases, including that of a 67-year-old woman from West Java who died in October 2006. In her case, the H5N1 virus was reported to have been found in her &lt;a href="w%3Acerebrospinal%20fluid"&gt;cerebrospinal fluid&lt;/a&gt; (CSF).

The ♡❤Kedaulatan Rakyat♡❤, a newspaper based in &lt;a href="w%3AYogyakarta"&gt;Yogyakarta&lt;/a&gt;, reports that following the death of the 26-year-old man on Thursday, 125 of his neighbors have been examined for signs of bird flu and 34 have been tested for the virus. Thirty are reported to have flu-like symptoms but are said to be suffering from seasonal flu.

The &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organization"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WHO) has confirmed a total of 81 H5N1 cases including 63 deaths in Indonesia since 2005. However, there have been at least an additional 13 locally confirmed H5N1 cases including 11 deaths in Indonesia since January 29 of this year. According to these figures, Indonesia has had the highest number (94+) of H5N1 human infections, surpassing Vietnam's total of 93 cases. The WHO has not had access to H5N1 samples from Indonesia since January when a dispute arose over the use of H5N1 samples from Indonesia in commercially made vaccines. 

Scientists fear the deadly H5N1 strain could mutate and become easily transmissible among people, triggering a devastating &lt;a href="w%3Apandemic"&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. According to the WHO, last year in Indonesia a 32-year-old man was probably infected with H5N1 via his 10-year-old son (both died), suggesting that the virus had in that instance acquired the ability to transmit human-to-human, albeit in a limited manner. The father and son were part of a larger, familial cluster in which at least six persons died.

Today Sailors of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHMCS%20York"&gt;HMCS York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Cadets of RCSCC 18 Vanguard, Navy League Cadets of NLCC Ark Royal and Air Cadets of 618 Queen City Squadron marched though &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADowntown%20Toronto"&gt;Downtown Toronto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with drums beating, colors flying, and rifles held proudly. All this was to mark the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABattle%20of%20the%20Atlantic%20%281939%E2%80%931945%29"&gt;Battle of the Atlantic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which was a series of naval battles fought from 1939 to the end of the &lt;a href="World%20War%20II"&gt;second world war&lt;/a&gt;. During the Battle, &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; lost about 2000 Sailors and 762 members of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Canadian%20Air%20Force"&gt;Royal Canadian Air Force&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The team of the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Melbourne"&gt;University of Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; has won the fifth annual &lt;a href="w%3AELSA_Moot_Court_Competition_on_WTO_Law"&gt;ELSA Moot Court Competition on WTO Law&lt;/a&gt; for law students in &lt;a href="Geneva"&gt;Geneva&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, after beating the team from the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Hong%20Kong"&gt;University of Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt;. 

Organised by the European Law Students' Association (&lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Law%20Students%27%20Association"&gt;ELSA&lt;/a&gt;), the competition brings together students from around the world each year to contest a case based on the legal system and case law of the &lt;a href="World%20Trade%20Organization"&gt;World Trade Organization&lt;/a&gt; – the global treaty that governs world trade and commerce. 

This year, the case for the competition was on the topic of &lt;a href="w%3Aintellectual%20property"&gt;intellectual property&lt;/a&gt; rights and access to essential medicines – one of the most contentious issues in world trade in the past decade. Participating teams played out a dispute between two WTO members – one setting aside a pharmaceutical &lt;a href="w%3Apatent"&gt;patent&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3Arespondent"&gt;respondent&lt;/a&gt;), the other challenging this on behalf of its industry (&lt;a href="w%3Acomplainant"&gt;complainant&lt;/a&gt;).

Under World Trade Organization rules, a country can sidestep patents by issuing a "&lt;a href="w%3Acompulsory%20license"&gt;compulsory license&lt;/a&gt;" - a legal mechanism that allows a country to manufacture or &lt;a href="w%3Aimport"&gt;import&lt;/a&gt; generic versions of patented drugs for public health and national emergencies while paying the patent holder only a small royalty.

The global finals last week were the culmination of months of national and regional rounds, with eighteen teams from universities in &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="North%20America"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="South%20America"&gt;Latin America&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Asia"&gt;Asia-Pacific&lt;/a&gt; winning a trip to Geneva for the final round. The first semi final was contested by the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Sydney"&gt;University of Sydney&lt;/a&gt; and the University of Melbourne, while University of Hong Kong and &lt;a href="w%3AGeorgetown%20University"&gt;Georgetown University&lt;/a&gt; fought out the second semi final.

In the grand final at the WTO Centre &lt;a href="w%3AWilliam%20Rappard"&gt;William Rappard&lt;/a&gt;, the University of Melbourne acted for complainant, the Government of Costo (imaginary &lt;a href="w%3Adeveloped%20country"&gt;developed&lt;/a&gt; WTO member), while the University of Hong Kong defended the position of the Government of Factoril (imaginary &lt;a href="w%3Adeveloping%20country"&gt;developing&lt;/a&gt; WTO member) – respondent in the matter. 

After the two and a half hours of intense debates, the Grand Panel, including Gabrielle Marceau from the WTO Secretariat, Jayashree Watal from the WTO Intellectual Property Division and Werner Zdouc from the &lt;a href="w%3AAppellate%20Body"&gt;WTO Appellate Body&lt;/a&gt; Secretariat, decided in favour of complainant. The arguments submitted in favour of protecting the intellectual property rights of the pharmaceutical patent holder were deemed to be better structured and presented which led to the University of Melbourne winning the competition.

"The subject of the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health has raised a wide range of issues in the public debate. I think the ELSA Moot Court gave a timely opportunity to bright, young lawyers involved with WTO law to reflect upon and debate the complex legal and political issues raised by this subject," said Jatashree Watal, Counsellor, WTO Intellectual Property Division.

The students' debates during the final round in Geneva coincided with the decision of the Government of &lt;a href="Brazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; to put patients' interests before patent holder's interests and issue compulsory license on important &lt;a href="AIDS"&gt;AIDS&lt;/a&gt; drug. Some parties believe that the economic interests cannot be compared with saving human lives and protecting the public health while others would prefer a more balanced approach to this matter.

&lt;a href="w%3AManchester%20United%20F.C."&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt; clinched the &lt;a href="w%3APremier%20League"&gt;Barclays Premiership&lt;/a&gt; title Sunday after second place &lt;a href="w%3AChelsea%20F.C."&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt; drew at &lt;a href="w%3AEmirates%20Stadium"&gt;Emirates Stadium&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="w%3AArsenal%20F.C."&gt;Arsenal&lt;/a&gt;. United put the pressure on Chelsea Saturday with a 1-0 win over hometown rivals &lt;a href="w%3AManchester%20City%20F.C."&gt;Manchester City&lt;/a&gt;, leaving Chelsea requiring a win to keep the title race going.

Saturdays game saw United's top goal scorer, &lt;a href="w%3ACristiano%20Ronaldo"&gt;Cristiano Ronaldo&lt;/a&gt;, as the only name on the scoresheet when he slotted home the ball from the penalty spot after being dragged down in the area by &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Ball%20%28footballer%29"&gt;Michael Ball&lt;/a&gt;. Ball had earlier stomped on Ronaldo with his cleat, but the action was missed by the referee, and Ball was allowed to continue with the match. Ball was then involved in the game again as he earned a penalty when he was brought down by &lt;a href="w%3AWes%20Brown"&gt;Wes Brown&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3ADarius%20Vassell"&gt;Darius Vassell&lt;/a&gt; stepped up to the spot, but his hard drive at the center of the net was saved by the trailing leg of &lt;a href="w%3AEdwin%20van%20der%20Sar"&gt;Edwin Van Der Sar&lt;/a&gt;.

With the pressure now on Chelsea to win at Arsenal, the blues traveled to the Emirates in hopes of keeping their title hopes alive. As the game neared half-time, &lt;a href="w%3AKhalid%20Boulahrouz"&gt;Khalid Boulahrouz&lt;/a&gt; brought down &lt;a href="w%3AJ%C3%BAlio%20Baptista"&gt;Júlio Baptista&lt;/a&gt; in the box, and a penalty was awarded to Arsenal, while Boulahrouz was red-carded. &lt;a href="w%3AGilberto%20Silva"&gt;Gilberto Silva&lt;/a&gt; converted easily on the spot kick, and Arsenal went into half time with the lead. For much of the second half, Arsenal controlled the game, but on 70 minutes, a flashing header by &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Essien"&gt;Michael Essien&lt;/a&gt; tied the match for Chelsea. The blues pushed for the second goal, but it never came, and the draw meant Chelsea could no long catch United, who are seven points ahead in the table.

The title is United's sixteenth English championship and their ninth Premiership crown in fifteen years, but their first in four years, after league domination by both Arsenal and Chelsea left United adrift in the race. 

United travel to &lt;a href="w%3AStamford%20Bridge%20%28stadium%29"&gt;Stamford Bridge&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday in what Chelsea were hoping to make a title decider, but with United already in control, the fans at the Bridge will instead clap United onto the field in a Guard of Honor.

Federal investigators in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; have arrested six men on Monday evening on charges of conspiracy to kill US servicemembers. The men are alleged to be members of an &lt;a href="w%3AIslamic%20fundamentalism"&gt;Islamic radical&lt;/a&gt; terror cell who were planning a heavily armed attack against soldiers at the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Army"&gt;United States Army&lt;/a&gt; facility at &lt;a href="w%3AFort%20Dix"&gt;Fort Dix&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="New%20Jersey"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Attorney"&gt;US Attorney's Office&lt;/a&gt; said that some of the men were living illegally in the US, while others were legal immigrants. It identified the men as Dritan Duka, Eljvir Duka, Shain Duka, Serdar Tatar, Mohamad Shnewer and Agron Abdullahu. They were said to be four ethnic &lt;a href="w%3AAlbanian"&gt;Albanian&lt;/a&gt;s (from the former Yugoslavia), one from &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;, and the sixth man from &lt;a href="Jordan"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt;.

Reportedly, the &lt;a href="FBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; had the men under surveillance for 16 months as they trained with both &lt;a href="w%3Apaintball"&gt;paintball&lt;/a&gt; guns and real weapons in &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Poconos"&gt;the Poconos Mountains&lt;/a&gt; area of &lt;a href="Pennsylvania"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;. The men video-taped their training and brought the tapes to a camera store to be copied to DVD. The camera store owner alerted the FBI, which then began its investigation.

♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Star-Ledger"&gt;The Star-Ledger&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reports that the men were lured by an FBI informant into a &lt;a href="w%3ASting%20operation"&gt;sting operation&lt;/a&gt; to meet with an arms dealer where they wanted to purchase five &lt;a href="w%3AAK-47"&gt;AK-47&lt;/a&gt; automatic machine guns and three &lt;a href="w%3AM16%20rifle"&gt;M-16&lt;/a&gt; assault rifles at a residence in &lt;a href="w%3ACherry%20Hill%20Township%2C%20New%20Jersey"&gt;Cherry Hill, New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;. It was at this point they were arrested.

U.S. Attorney for New Jersey &lt;a href="w%3AChristopher%20J.%20Christie"&gt;Christopher J. Christie&lt;/a&gt; called the camera store owner who tipped off the FBI to the terror cell "an American hero", according to Richard Degener of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Press%20of%20Atlantic%20City"&gt;The Press of Atlantic City&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. Christie spoke at the Flanders Hotel on Tuesday to the &lt;a href="w%3AOcean%20City%2C%20New%20Jersey"&gt;Ocean City Regional Chamber of Commerce&lt;/a&gt;. "The camera store owner saw Muslim men in military garb toting weapons in the woods. He heard them talking about jihad and how Allah was great. He called the FBI and became a hero," Christie said.

One member of the terror cell was able to gain detailed knowledge of the military base from his work as a pizza delivery driver. The plot was to take over guard posts and "kill hundreds of Fort Dix soldiers", Christie said. &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Marshals%20Service"&gt;U.S. Marshal&lt;/a&gt; James Plousis joined Christie at the Chamber of Commerce luncheon with 50 area &lt;a href="w%3AAtlantic%20City%2C%20New%20Jersey"&gt;Atlantic City&lt;/a&gt; merchants to talk about the value of reporting suspicious activity.

"They are not being charged with being members of an international terror organisation," said &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; spokesperson, &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Snow"&gt;Tony Snow&lt;/a&gt;. "However, their involvement in weapons training, operational surveillance and discussions about killing American military personnel warranted a strong law enforcement response."

After four years, the suspended &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Ireland%20Assembly"&gt;Northern Ireland Assembly&lt;/a&gt; has taken over the direct governing of the part of the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; that since &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;'s independence in 1922 has been controversially disputed.

The Assembly, which was established as part of 1998's &lt;a href="w%3AGood%20Friday%20Agreement"&gt;Good Friday Agreement&lt;/a&gt;, was suspended in 2002 over allegations of Republican spying. During that time the entire province was ruled directly from London. Four years ago, few could have expected that &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Unionist%20Party"&gt;Democratic Unionist Party&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href="w%3AIan%20Paisley"&gt;Ian Paisley&lt;/a&gt;, the preacher known for the longest time in Northern Ireland politics as "Dr. No" and &lt;a href="w%3ASinn%20F%C3%A9in"&gt;Sinn Féin&lt;/a&gt; deputy leader &lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20McGuinness"&gt;Martin McGuinness&lt;/a&gt;, who at one time was an &lt;a href="w%3AProvisional%20Irish%20Republican%20Army"&gt;IRA&lt;/a&gt; commander, would be sharing power together. However, with the addition of the &lt;a href="w%3ASaint%20Andrews%20Agreement"&gt;Saint Andrews Agreement&lt;/a&gt; to which both Sinn Féin and the &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Unionist%20Party"&gt;Democratic Unionist Party&lt;/a&gt; (DUP) agreed, this became a reality.

Ian Paisley will take his post as &lt;a href="w%3AOffice%20of%20the%20First%20Minister%20and%20Deputy%20First%20Minister"&gt;First Minister of Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt; and Martin McGuinness will serve as his deputy. The DUP receives four cabinet ministers which includes the deputy leader of the party, &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Robinson%20%28politician%29"&gt;Peter Robinson&lt;/a&gt;, becoming the head of the &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Finance%20and%20Personnel"&gt;Department of Finance and Personnel&lt;/a&gt;. Sinn Féin gets three. Meanwhile, the other, less-powerful unionist party, the &lt;a href="w%3AUlster%20Unionist%20Party"&gt;Ulster Unionist Party&lt;/a&gt; receives two which includes UUP leader, &lt;a href="w%3AReg%20Empey"&gt;Sir Reg Empey&lt;/a&gt; heading up the &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20for%20Employment%20and%20Learning"&gt;Department for Employment and Learning&lt;/a&gt;. Northern Ireland's other mainstream nationalist party, the &lt;a href="w%3ASocial%20Democratic%20and%20Labour%20Party"&gt;Social Democratic and Labour Party&lt;/a&gt; will head the &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20for%20Social%20Development"&gt;Department for Social Development&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Reactions</h2>
&lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Prime%20Minister"&gt;British Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; said today's events could "make history anew" and to "escape the heavy chains of history". Blair said, "Look back and we see centuries pock-marked by conflict, hardship, even hatred, among the people of these islands." 

Blair's predecessor, &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Major"&gt;Sir John Major&lt;/a&gt; said "The sight of people that were once totally antagonistic to one another sitting down to plan the future of Northern Ireland is very attractive," adding "I always believed from the outset that it was possible but that it would be difficult and that it would take a long time."

Irish &lt;a href="w%3ATaoiseach"&gt;Taoiseach&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABertie%20Ahern"&gt;Bertie Ahern&lt;/a&gt; thanked his British counterpart saying "For 10 tough years, he has spent more times dealing with the issues of the island of Ireland than any person ever could have asked any other person to do."

&lt;a href="w%3AMary%20McAleese"&gt;Mary McAleese&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20Ireland"&gt;President of Ireland&lt;/a&gt; said, "It truly is an extraordinary day in the history of Northern Ireland, the island of Ireland and indeed of relations between Ireland and Britain. You carry the hopes of everybody as you take forward now the mandate you have been given by the people." 

Ian Paisley said of today's events "I believe we're starting on a road which will bring us back to peace and to prosperity." 

His new deputy, McGuiness said that they've already taken joint decisions but in the context of not being in power. He said, "All of that is going to change in the next couple of hours, and by midday today, we're going to be in charge, and we're going to be charged with the responsibility of governing in the interests of the people," adding, "I think we do so in the belief and the sure knowledge that we have the overwhelming support of all of the people of Ireland for what we're about to do."

Sinn Féin president &lt;a href="w%3AGerry%20Adams"&gt;Gerry Adams&lt;/a&gt; said, "I think what today proves is that dialogue and perseverance and tenacity and persistence can bring about results." He thanked everyone who helped make today possible and added, "It's a good day for Ireland, it's a good day for all of the people of this island."

Sir Reg Empey stated "The mission of the Ulster Unionist Party in the months and years ahead, as we rebuild and reform, is to demonstrate that unionism and politics in general is not about a sectarian power-grab."

Empey's predecessor, &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Trimble%2C%20Baron%20Trimble"&gt;Lord David Trimble&lt;/a&gt; who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in bringing to peace Northern Ireland with John Hume, the former leader of SDLP said, " I see it as being the culmination, the final implementation of the agreement that was made on Good Friday in 1998."

&lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Durkan"&gt;Mark Durkan&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the SDLP mentioned "What today shows is that when finally you have a government setting a deadline and setting terms and keeping to them, you can get somewhere," stating that Sinn Féin had underwritten on decommissioning while the DUP had underwritten on power-sharing. He also added that "It actually took people like the McCartney sisters to show governments how to set terms and hold terms in which the IRA had to move," in reference to the sisters of Robert McCartney, a &lt;a href="w%3ACatholicism"&gt;Catholic&lt;/a&gt; man murdered by the Provisional IRA last year over what was a pub fight.
&lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Ford"&gt;David Ford&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the cross-communal &lt;a href="w%3AAlliance%20Party%20of%20Northern%20Ireland"&gt;Alliance Party&lt;/a&gt; said "We are here to make devolution work now, the DUP and Sinn Féin must convince local people that they can work together; much progress has been made but the real work only begins now."

&lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; senator &lt;a href="w%3AEdward%20Kennedy"&gt;Edward Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;, who was in Belfast for the event said "A brighter day has dawned for the people of Northern Ireland, and it would not have been possible without the commitment and determination by all of Northern Ireland's political leaders to find a new way forward," and that "each of them is a profile in courage for our time and all time. Kennedy also said, "Northern Ireland has shown the world that peace is possible, even in the face of tragic history," he stated after attending ceremonies with the American delegation.

&lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;President of the United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; released a statement saying "I commend the Assembly for your dedication to Northern Ireland and I applaud the people of this region for your desire to overcome a history of violence and division." He added that he commended Blair and Ahern for their leadership and vision, and that The United States will continue to support your efforts to further advance the peace process. Together we can build a more hopeful future for all."

70 year-old retiree Joan McCoubrey of Belfast, a Catholic who lost one of her brothers in 1971 said, "I don’t want my grandchildren to go through what I went through."

However, 48 year-old &lt;a href="w%3AProtestantism"&gt;Protestant&lt;/a&gt; homemaker Deborah Harbinson of Belfast said "There are still a lot of problems left to be tackled, there’s still hidden violence and division and few job opportunities."

&lt;a href="w%3ABarry%20Bonds"&gt;Barry Bonds&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco%20Giants"&gt;San Francisco Giants&lt;/a&gt; has officially tied &lt;a href="w%3AHank%20Aaron"&gt;Hank Aaron&lt;/a&gt;'s decades old home run record. Bonds hit the home run at &lt;a href="w%3APETCO%20Park"&gt;PETCO Park&lt;/a&gt; in an away game against the &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Diego%20Padres"&gt;San Diego Padres&lt;/a&gt; Saturday night. Pitcher &lt;a href="w%3AClay%20Hensley"&gt;Clay Hensley&lt;/a&gt; gave up the homer in the second inning, a 382 foot homer over the left-center field wall. Adam Hughes, a 33-year old plumber caught the ball, which is worth millions of dollars on the collectibles market. Security guards quickly escorted the plumber and the ball from the stands.

In post game interviews, Barry said, "The hard part is over," referring to the long try to tie the record. Aaron did not issue a statement.

Bonds did not comment yesterday on the steroids scandal that has tainted his last several years in baseball. Currently, Bonds is under investigation for perjury by a federal grand jury regarding his 2003 testimony on the BALCO steroids case, in which he denied using performance-enhancing drugs. Bonds allegedly used steroids, which were not prohibited by Major League Baseball at the time, though they could not be obtained without a prescription.

Bonds is not only first in career home runs but also is first in career walks and intentional walks. Bonds also holds the single-season home run record with 73 home runs in 2001.

Bonds, a sure fire Hall of Famer, is one of the oldest players in the majors. He turned 43 on July 24. So far, Bonds has hit 21 home runs this season.

Saeed Ansari, an Afghan intelligence spokesman said, "Mullah Dadullah has been killed and his body is in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKandahar"&gt;Kandahar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ."

The governor of Kandahar, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAsadullah%20Khalid"&gt;Asadullah Khalid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; told &lt;a href="Reuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;: "Yes, he was killed last night and right now I have his body before me." He added that Dadullah was killed in &lt;a href="Helmand%20Province"&gt;Helmand Province&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="NATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; spokesperson Major John Thomas confirmed that Dadullah has been killed. "We fully expect Mullah Dadullah will be replaced in time, but for now the insurgency has received a serious blow," Thomas said.

Mullah Dadullah was frequently seen in videos with a machine gun and artillery in his clerical clothing along with his turban. However, it is known that he attended &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Amadrassas"&gt;madrassas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; before joining the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASoviet%20war%20in%20Afghanistan"&gt;fight against the Soviet forces&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Last month, Mullah Dadullah gave an interview in which he said that &lt;a href="Osama%20bin%20Laden"&gt;Osama bin Laden&lt;/a&gt; was alive and was coordinating the activities of the Taliban. In 2005, Mullah Dadullah vowed, "The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Amujahideen"&gt;mujahideen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; will not lay down their arms unless the Americans leave and an &lt;a href="Islamic"&gt;Islamic&lt;/a&gt; state is established."

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; has announced that access to popular high-bandwidth websites, including user-generated content sites like &lt;a href="MySpace"&gt;MySpace&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="YouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, will be blocked on &lt;a href="w%3Amilitary"&gt;military&lt;/a&gt; computers. The block takes effect on Monday and will apply worldwide for all military personnel using Department of Defense computers. 

The block is targeted at sites that contain user generated content. Including MySpace and YouTube, a total of 12 sites will be off limits according to Robert Weller of the ♡❤Associated Press♡❤: Metacafe, iFilm, StupidVideos, FileCabi, BlackPlanet, Hi5, Pandora, MTV, 1.fm, live365 and Photobucket.

According to U.S. Strategic Command officials the block is due to "bandwidth/network issues" resulting in possible "clogging [of] the network". 

The move affects soldiers' ability to view content on these sites, but does not affect the military's ability to provide content. Army Maj. Gen. , the Multinational Force Iraq spokesman, told Carmen L. Gleason of the ♡❤American Forces Press Service♡❤ in mid-March: "We want the American public, from an unfiltered vantage point, to be able to see what coalition forces and Iraqi security forces are doing here in Iraq."

<h1>McGuinty wins re-election in 2007 Ontario General Election</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=McGuinty%20wins%20re-election%20in%202007%20Ontario%20General%20Election&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The official results of the &lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20General%20Election%2C%202007"&gt;2007 Ontario General Election&lt;/a&gt; now show that the &lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20Liberal%20Party"&gt;Ontario Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt; has been re-elected. The Liberal Party lead by &lt;a href="w%3ADalton%20McGuinty"&gt;Dalton McGuinty&lt;/a&gt; will spend the next four years in a &lt;a href="w%3Amajority%20government"&gt;majority government&lt;/a&gt;.

McGuinty is the first Liberal premier to have back-to-back majorities since &lt;a href="w%3AMitchell%20Hepburn"&gt;Mitchell Hepburn&lt;/a&gt;, who held office from 1934-1942, with his second majority starting in 1937. Hepburn's government legacy includes the Queen Elizabeth Way and Rainbow Bridge to Niagara Falls, New York.

<h2>McGuinty wins, Tory doesn't get seat</h2>
McGuinty was re-elected in his riding of &lt;a href="w%3AOttawa%20South%20%28provincial%20electoral%20district%29"&gt;Ottawa South&lt;/a&gt;.

In his speech, McGuinty told supporters "For this great privilege I am profoundly grateful." He continued by stating that the party "deplore[s] negativity," and that no one should "mistake our civility as a weakness."

&lt;a href="w%3AProgressive%20Conservative%20Party%20of%20Ontario"&gt;Progressive Conservative&lt;/a&gt; (PC) leader &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Tory"&gt;John Tory&lt;/a&gt; was defeated by Liberal candidate &lt;a href="w%3AKathleen%20Wynne"&gt;Kathleen Wynne&lt;/a&gt; in the riding of &lt;a href="w%3ADon%20Valley%20West"&gt;Don Valley West&lt;/a&gt;. He previously held a seat in his former riding of &lt;a href="w%3ADufferin%E2%80%94Peel%E2%80%94Wellington%E2%80%94Grey"&gt;Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey&lt;/a&gt;. A leadership election will be held if Tory resigns his position, a move he has so far avoided.

Asking hypothetically "Is [Tory] a little too progressive for the Conservatives?", Liberal Gerard Kennedy on CTV echoed the thoughts of many media outlets, who feel the faith-based school funding was the key blow to Tory's campaign. Tory called McGuinty to concede at 10:30 p.m. McGuinty was first to make a televised speech, despite the general practice of winners speaking last.

&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Ontario"&gt;New Democratic&lt;/a&gt; (NDP) leader &lt;a href="w%3AHoward%20Hampton"&gt;Howard Hampton&lt;/a&gt; was re-elected in his riding of &lt;a href="w%3AKenora%E2%80%94Rainy%20River%20%28provincial%20electoral%20district%29"&gt;Kenora—Rainy River&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Party%20of%20Ontario"&gt;Green Party&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href="w%3AFrank%20de%20Jong"&gt;Frank de Jong&lt;/a&gt; ran in &lt;a href="w%3ABurlington%20%28electoral%20district%29"&gt;Burlington&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Ontario%20Green%20Party%20leader%20to%20run%20in%20byelection"&gt;earlier this year in a by-election&lt;/a&gt;, but lost to a PC strong-hold candidate. He ran again in the riding of &lt;a href="w%3ADavenport%20%28electoral%20district%29"&gt;Davenport&lt;/a&gt;, but lost to Liberal &lt;a href="w%3AMario%20Silva"&gt;Mario Silva&lt;/a&gt;.

As of 23:40 EDT with 57.6% of the polls reporting:

Results trickled in for most of the early evening, due to the clog of visitors to its public website. At 9:49 p.m. ET last night, CTV told viewers that they were only receiving result updates every ten seconds at top speed, compared to a test run of ten results per second. They speculated at the time that the computers' new software was to blame. The media outlets were still calling victories early in the evening, with one station unironically declaring a candidate with seven votes (compared to two others with three apiece) as "well up in front".

Former PC Premier &lt;a href="w%3AErnie%20Eves"&gt;Ernie Eves&lt;/a&gt;, NDP MP &lt;a href="w%3AOlivia%20Chow"&gt;Olivia Chow&lt;/a&gt;, and former Liberal education minister &lt;a href="w%3AGerard%20Kennedy"&gt;Gerard Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; appeared as commentators throughout the evening. Former Ontario Liberal MPP &lt;a href="w%3AAlvin%20Curling"&gt;Alvin Curling&lt;/a&gt;, who was the first Black speaker of the Ontario Legislature, and former Deputy Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ASheila%20Copps"&gt;Sheila Copps&lt;/a&gt; were among those on Citytv Toronto. Global's panelists included &lt;a href="w%3AWarren%20Kinsella"&gt;Warren Kinsella&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJane%20Pitfield"&gt;Jane Pitfield&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMarilyn%20Churley"&gt;Marilyn Churley&lt;/a&gt;, while CHCH News hosted Liberal MP &lt;a href="w%3AGarth%20Turner"&gt;Garth Turner&lt;/a&gt;.

First Nations representative Regional Chief Angus Toulouse congratulated McGuinty on his re-election, suggesting this would allow the chance to build on an existing relationship, rather than start anew. "There is a lot of work to do in follow up to the important recommendations outlined in the Final Report of the Ipperwash Inquiry. This work must be done jointly and in a collaborative manner and I am encouraged by the fact that the Premier, and the Government, have committed to address this in partnership with First Nations."

<h2>Referendum on electoral reform</h2>
The election included a &lt;a href="w%3Areferendum"&gt;referendum&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="w%3Aelectoral%20reform"&gt;electoral reform&lt;/a&gt;, asking voters whether to replace the existing &lt;a href="w%3APlurality%20voting%20system"&gt;plurality voting system&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href="w%3AMixed%20member%20proportional%20representation"&gt;Mixed Member Proportional (MMP) voting system&lt;/a&gt;. MMP lost as the existing system was favoured by a margin of 63.0%, based on unofficial referendum results as at 23:40 EDT.

Throughout the night, many outlets stated the opinion that the referendum was poorly promoted. Even Toronto's Mayor David Miller, appearing on TVO at 9:56 p.m., called the proposed process "MPMP". Some outlets, like the Owen Sound Sun Times called the referendum process "set up to fail".

While only 50% of eligible voters cast a ballot in the general election, 54% cast a referendum ballot.

The Canadian Federation of Students-Ontario chairperson Jen Hassum commented that the "projected defeat of Mixed Member Proportional reinforces a massive generational divide in Ontario. Recent polling showed that 67 per cent of voters under the age of 35 supported the new voting system."

<h1>Wolfowitz to quit as head of the World Bank</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Wolfowitz%20to%20quit%20as%20head%20of%20the%20World%20Bank&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The Executive Directors of the World Bank have issued a statement to the effect that &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Wolfowitz"&gt;Paul Wolfowitz&lt;/a&gt; is to resign as President of the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Bank%20Group"&gt;World Bank Group&lt;/a&gt; effective 30th June 2007, and that further meetings will take place tomorrow to deal with arrangements for the interim period.

Wolfowitz has faced a number of calls for his resignation in recent weeks after accusations that he had behaved improperly and overlooked a conflict of interest with regard to the pay rise given to his partner, &lt;a href="w%3AShaha%20Riza"&gt;Shaha Riza&lt;/a&gt;, an employee of the Bank at the time of his appointment as President, who was subsequently re-assigned to the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; State Department.

In their statement, the Executive Directors indicate that having carefully considered the report of a board-member committee which had investigated Wolfowitz's actions, they accepted that all parties had acted ethically, in good faith, and in what were believed to be the best interests of the institution. However the conclusion had to be drawn that there is a need to review the governance framework of the World Bank Group and in particular procedural and other aspects of the Ethics Committee.

The Directors pay tribute to the service that Wolfowitz has given to the World Bank, citing a number of achievements, particularly a number of initiatives involving countries and relief programmes in Africa. They also added regret that the recent events had overshadowed his achievements at the Bank.

In a separate and lengthy statement, Wolfowitz outlined many of the achievements of the Bank during his time as President, and acknowledged the contribution of those working for the Bank in the delivery of its programmes and support for a wide range of organisations throughout the world. He considered however that his resignation was in the best interests of the Bank.

Wolfowitz had enjoyed considerable support from the US Administration, and particular endorsement from &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Dick%20Cheney"&gt;Vice-President Cheney&lt;/a&gt;. However he had been less popular with other governments around the world, particularly in &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3ANewcastle%20United%20F.C."&gt;Newcastle United&lt;/a&gt; appointed &lt;a href="w%3ASam%20Allardyce"&gt;Sam Allardyce&lt;/a&gt; as manager on May 15, following the resignation of &lt;a href="w%3AGlenn%20Roeder"&gt;Glenn Roeder&lt;/a&gt; on May 6.

Allardyce had turned the opportunity to manage Newcastle down when offered it in the past as he chose to stay on as manager of &lt;a href="w%3ABolton%20Wanderers%20F.C."&gt;Bolton Wanderers&lt;/a&gt;. However, Allardyce's eight year stint as Bolton manager came to an end following his resignation on April 29, 2007. Allardyce cited that his need for a rest as well as his desire to win silverware was behind his decision.

When asked what made Newcastle a more likely destination for trophies than Bolton, he replied: "Everything about it. The resources, the facilities, the fans, the amount of revenue that can be generated by a club of this size. No disrespect to Bolton, it is a club I love, but this club is massive in terms of what it can achieve."

<h1>British adventurer flies powered paraglider over Everest</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=British%20adventurer%20flies%20powered%20paraglider%20over%20Everest&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

British explorer and mountaineer Edward &lt;a href="w%3ABear%20Grylls"&gt;"Bear" Grylls&lt;/a&gt;, has set a new altitude record by piloting a powered paraglider above &lt;a href="w%3AMount%20Everest"&gt;Mount Everest&lt;/a&gt; reaching 29,494ft (8,990m). He and his fellow pilot, Giles Cardozo, who had invented and developed the parajet engine, set out on their attempt from the &lt;a href="w%3AHimalayas"&gt;Himalayan&lt;/a&gt; village of Pheriche (altitude 14,435ft (4,400m)) in the early morning of 14th May.

Grylls, 33, is a mountaineer, best selling author and television presenter who spent three years with the elite British &lt;a href="w%3ASpecial%20Air%20Service"&gt;Special Air Service&lt;/a&gt; ("SAS") forces. During this time he was involved in a horrific parachuting accident in which he broke his back in three places, almost severing his spinal cord. Remarkably, in 1998, after months of rehabilitation, he became at 23, the youngest British climber to scale Mount Everest and return alive.

Cardozo is considered to be one of the top paragliding pilots in the world, and it is reported that he and Grylls first came up with the idea for the attempt about a year ago when he had invented the engine that would take them up the mountain.

Grylls and Cardozo flew their paragliders together to 28,001ft (8,353m) surviving temperatures of minus 76°F (-60°C) and dangerously low oxygen levels, when a fault developed in Cardozo's engine, and he had to abort his attempt just 984ft (300m) below the summit. Grylls went on to reach his record height at 09.33 local time. He had originally intended to cross the Mountain but turned back to base camp fearing that he might be arrested if he entered Chinese airspace.

On his return to Kathmandu, Grylls voiced his feelings of loneliness and exhilaration:
The attempt was sponsored by British technology and engineering group &lt;a href="w%3AGKN"&gt;GKN&lt;/a&gt;. The project, GKN Mission Everest, raised £500,000 (approximately $1m) for &lt;a href="http%3A//www.globalangels.org/pages/3002/Home.htm"&gt;Global Angels&lt;/a&gt;, a charity helping children in Africa, Asia and Latin America.

<h3>Paraglider survives at 32,000 feet</h3>

In a separate incident, a German paragliding champion has survived being sucked up by a storm to a height of 32,612ft (9,940m) whilst preparing for a world paragliding championship in &lt;a href="w%3AManilla%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Manilla, New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;. 

Ewa Wisnierska, 35, the 2005 World Cup paragliding winner, lost consciousness and was covered in ice and battered by orange-sized hailstones as she was pulled upwards by the sudden tornado-like storm which she had been attempting to skirt. After regaining consciousness as she descended she was able to make contact with her ground team which had been tracking her by her GPS equipment, and landed safely 40 miles (60km) from where she took off.

Remarkably she spent only an hour in hospital after her experience, being treated for frostbite and blistering to her face and ears.

A fellow competitor, 42 year old Chinese man, He Zhongpin, who was also caught up in the storm, was not so fortunate and died from lack of oxygen and the extreme cold.

&lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; state senator &lt;a href="w%3ACarole%20Migden"&gt;Carole Migden&lt;/a&gt; crashed her state provided &lt;a href="w%3ASport%20utility%20vehicle"&gt;SUV&lt;/a&gt; into a &lt;a href="w%3AHonda"&gt;Honda&lt;/a&gt; sedan while reaching for her phone. Migden has favored a new law penalizing drivers who talk on their &lt;a href="w%3AMobile%20phone"&gt;cellular phones&lt;/a&gt; (aka mobile phones).

The crash occurred on Highway 12 in &lt;a href="w%3ASolano%20County%2C%20California"&gt;Solano County, California&lt;/a&gt; Friday morning. The driver of the Honda was taken to a near-by hospital for minor injuries.

In 2006, Migden voted to fine drivers a minimum $20 fee for driving while talking on the phone without a hands-free device. The law will not go into effect until July 2008, so she will not receive a fine for using her phone. She said that she has taken full responsibility for the accident.

The &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%20Highway%20Patrol"&gt;California Highway Patrol&lt;/a&gt; (CHP) is now looking into reports of another accident involving Midgen.

"We're getting information now from the officers following up this morning that there was a second accident involving the center divider. Witnesses have her driving to the left of the number one lane and brushing against the guardrail," said Marvin Williford, spokesperson for the CHP in the Solano area.

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; President, &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;, was caught by members of the press this past weekend, not wearing his &lt;a href="w%3ASeatbelt"&gt;seat belt&lt;/a&gt; while "driving slowly" in a truck on his ranch in &lt;a href="w%3ACrawford%2C%20Texas"&gt;Crawford, Texas&lt;/a&gt;.

After the incident, &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; Press Secretary &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Snow"&gt;Tony Snow&lt;/a&gt; answered questions based on Bush's not wearing one. One question asked was "does he [Bush] wear a seat belt in the limo?"

"I don't know. Let me just back up, I have seen him wear it in the limo. I'm not going to give you a report card because my ventures in the limo are relatively rare. Well, it's always important to wear seat belts, especially when driving slowly on the ranch," said Snow to reporters.

Bush was greeting the &lt;a href="w%3ASecretary%20General%20of%20NATO"&gt;Secretary General&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="NATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJaap%20de%20Hoop%20Scheffer"&gt;Jaap de Hoop Scheffer&lt;/a&gt; and his wife on his ranch and giving them a tour. When he began to drive away, the press got a few pictures of Bush with no seatbelt on.

Snow was also asked if the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Secret%20Service"&gt;Secret Service&lt;/a&gt; was required to make Bush wear a seatbelt, to which he replied "the Secret Service, I guarantee you, looks after the president and is absolutely determined to ensure his safety in every way possible."

Despite the pictures, in &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, it is not a violation of any law, as seat belts are not required to be worn on private property.

"On private property, you're not required to wear your seat belt," said Texas Department of Public Safety spokeswoman, Tela Mange who also added that driving on private property with no seat belt is "fairly common."

&lt;a href="w%3ANewcastle%20United%20F.C."&gt;Newcastle United&lt;/a&gt; received a £133.1m ($263m) offer from &lt;a href="England"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; billionaire businessman &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Ashley%20%28businessman%29"&gt;Mike Ashley&lt;/a&gt; on May 23, 2007 to buy the club.

Ashley said in a statement "Newcastle United has a wonderful heritage and the passion of its fans is legendary. I am sure that, like me, they are already excited about the prospects for next season under the new manager's stewardship."

Ashley is already the largest shareholder in Newcastle United and currently runs &lt;a href="w%3ASports%20World%20International"&gt;Sports World International&lt;/a&gt;, the largest sporting goods retail in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; received an unwelcome gift from an overhead-flying &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Asparrow"&gt;sparrow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which deposited a fresh batch of its &lt;a href="wikt%3Afeces"&gt;feces&lt;/a&gt; on the left sleeve of Bush's suit. 

Bush was addressing the American press on Thursday in a nationally televised broadcast outside the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House%20Rose%20Garden"&gt;Rose Garden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The incident occurred just as Bush said, "I've got confidence in Al Gonzales doin' the job," referring to a question asked by a reporter about the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADismissal%20of%20U.S.%20attorneys%20controversy"&gt;controversial dismissal of several U.S. attorneys&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Bush then tried to remove the offending material several times with his hand. 

Deputy Press Secretary &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADana%20Perino"&gt;Dana Perino&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said the 'poo-drop' signified good luck saying, "It was his lucky day...everyone knows that's a sign of good luck." On the whole the media coverage of the incident has been lighthearted and humorous.

Protests continue in &lt;a href="Venezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt; over the Sunday closing of &lt;a href="w%3ARCTV"&gt;Radio Caracas Television&lt;/a&gt; (RCTV), the country's oldest and most popular TV station.

Hugo Chavez's reasons for not renewing the TV station's broadcasting license include RCTV's support of &lt;a href="w%3A2002%20Venezuelan%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat%20attempt"&gt;a coup d'état attempt&lt;/a&gt; in 2002. RCTV was not the only media station to support the coup but, they have been closed because many say that they are the most significant TV station of the opposition. Venevision which supported the coup at the time has recently had its license renewed for 5 more years, which many say is due for their change in their editorial stance. 

<h3>The protests</h3>
Protests began with opposition marches over the weekend. Shortly after the closing of RCTV, large student demonstrations appeared throughout the capital city of Caracas. The protests have continued all week and have spread throughout the country. Most of the student protests have originated from universities which are not aligned with Chavez; he says that the students do not like the public universities that threaten and compete with the non-aligned schools.

Protesters threw rocks at police officers, who have responded with rubber bullets and tear gas. Some protesters were arrested, and many were injured. Most were students.

Spontaneous rallies by government supporters have also appeared, supporting Hugo Chavez's decision. These protests were not the same size as some of the student protests. The police and national guard have been working to make sure that these opposing groups do not clash together.

Many websites related to the opposition have been down due to either high internet traffic or, theoretically, because CanTV; a large Venezuelan Telecommunications company, will not allow access to these websites in Venezuela. There is not much evidence for the supposed intervention by CanTV and is not much more than speculation at this point. Nonetheless, many websites and blogs have reported such incidents.

<h3>Chavez's statements</h3>
Chavez has repeatedly stated that the protests are organized by opposition forces wishing to destabilize the government much like the coup d'état attempt that took place five years earlier. 

&lt;a href="Hugo%20Ch%C3%A1vez"&gt;Hugo Chávez&lt;/a&gt; has also repeatedly threatened the TV station &lt;a href="w%3AGlobovisi%C3%B3n"&gt;Globovisión&lt;/a&gt;, which is the only significant opposition voice on television. Chavez claims that they encouraged his assassination and also helped the effort to unseat him during the 2002 coup d'état attempt.

<h3>Reactions</h3>
The closure of RCTV has been condemned in the United States and the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;U.S Senate&lt;/a&gt; has passed a resolution expressing "profound concern of the Senate regarding the transgression and freedom of thought and expression that is being carried out in Venezuela." 

&lt;a href="w%3ASpeaker%20of%20the%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;U.S House Speaker&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Nancy%20Pelosi"&gt;Nancy Pelosi&lt;/a&gt; has made this statement about the incident: ♡❤"President Chavez should know that efforts to suppress the media will not only ultimately fail, but are also a detriment to one of the pillars of democracy: freedom of expression."♡❤ Pelosi also said in a statement Wednesday in Washington. ♡❤"He should reconsider this ill-advised decision."♡❤

The press freedom advocacy group &lt;a href="w%3AReporters%20Without%20Borders"&gt;Reporters Without Borders&lt;/a&gt; called the closure "a serious violation of freedom of expression and a major setback to democracy and pluralism," and urged the international community to rally in defence of press freedom. 

Much like the &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; protests last year, students are using technology to their advantage; cell phones to communicate and video from phones is being broadcast on &lt;a href="w%3AYouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; and other video sharing websites. Videos that have been uploaded to YouTube are considered to be the most graphic, as television stations in Venezuela fear repercussion if they broadcast the footage.

<h1>Philadelphia breaks 80 year old building lease; moves to evict Scouts</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Philadelphia%20breaks%2080%20year%20old%20building%20lease%3B%20moves%20to%20evict%20Scouts&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
In an unannounced vote yesterday, the &lt;a href="w%3APhiladelphia%20City%20Council"&gt;Philadelphia City Council&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; voted 16-1 to endorse the eviction of, and end their lease held ♡❤in perpetuity♡❤ with, the local council of the &lt;a href="w%3ABoy%20Scouts%20of%20America"&gt;Boy Scouts&lt;/a&gt; in Philadelphia. The Scouts must pay &lt;a href="w%3AFair%20market%20rent"&gt;market rent&lt;/a&gt; or leave the building. The &lt;a href="w%3ACradle%20of%20Liberty%20Council"&gt;Cradle of Liberty Council&lt;/a&gt; has more than 60,000 members in &lt;a href="w%3APhiladelphia"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ADelaware%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania"&gt;Delaware&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMontgomery%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania"&gt;Montgomery&lt;/a&gt; Counties. 

<h2>Background</h2>
In a surprise move, the Philadelphia City Council voted to revoke the lease it signed with the Boy Scouts for the use of the land on the &lt;a href="w%3ABenjamin%20Franklin%20Parkway"&gt;Benjamin Franklin Parkway&lt;/a&gt; in 1928 "in perpetuity." This clears the way for the eviction of the Scouts from the building in July 2007, one year after having been given their eviction notice. The vote of the council was needed to confirm Mayor Street’s eviction notice.

The on-going dispute between the city and the Scouts is one of the &lt;a href="w%3ABoy%20Scouts%20of%20America%20membership%20controversies"&gt;controversies&lt;/a&gt; over the issue of avowed homosexuals being leaders in the Boy Scouts. The city of Philadelphia does not allow discrimination against openly gay people, and the Scouts have asserted that under the &lt;a href="w%3AFirst%20Amendment%23Petition%20and%20assembly"&gt;First Amendment&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFreedom%20of%20assembly"&gt;Freedom of assembly&lt;/a&gt; they can exclude people who don’t meet their membership standards.

In December 1928 the City of Philadelphia gave the &lt;a href="w%3APhiladelphia%20Council"&gt;Philadelphia Council&lt;/a&gt; permission to build a headquarters on city-owned land at 22nd and Spring Streets in &lt;a href="w%3AFairmount%20Park"&gt;Fairmount Park&lt;/a&gt;. The Scouts built their headquarters at their own expense and, complying with the terms of the agreement, immediately turned over the property to the city. In return they remained housed in their building rent free.

The Scouts have a non-discrimination policy, but have refused to include sexual orientation in their non-discrimination charter. This is due to pressure form the Mormon and Catholic churches, two of the largest sponsors of Scouting units. The Scouts require an oath of duty to God and the group's rules prohibit participation by any person who is an avowed homosexual. The policy over the exclusion of openly gay leaders had been challenged in court, but in 2000 the U.S. Supreme Court confirmed that as a private group, the Scouts could set restrictions for their leaders.

Gay activists then turned their sights on arrangements such as that in Berkeley (California) and Philadelphia, where the Scouts had been using public land rent free. In 2003 the council said it would adopt a nondiscrimination policy on homosexuals, but reversed itself within days under pressure from the National Council.

The resolution was introduced unexpectedly by Councilman &lt;a href="w%3ADarrell%20L.%20Clarke"&gt;Darrell L. Clarke&lt;/a&gt; and passed, 16-1, with no debate, with only Council Minority Leader Brian J. O'Neill voting against the resolution. "My hope is that the resolution will give a little more leverage to the city and that [the parties] can come up with some kind of compromise," Clarke said. "Honestly, no one wants to see them out of there."

A spokesman for the Cradle of Liberty Council, said scout officials were disappointed at the council vote and that they were not told in advance. "This is the way it's been done all along," said Jeff Jubelirer. "We feel we haven't been dealt with fairly." The Scouts are caught between a rock and a hard place. If they adopt the non-discrimination policy demanded by the city, they lose their national charter from the Boy Scouts. "The real victims here are the 40,000 kids in Philadelphia who potentially could lose after-school programs at a time when Philadelphia's &lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20countries%20by%20homicide%20rate"&gt;murder rate&lt;/a&gt; is soaring," Jubelirer said. 

City Solicitor Romulo Diaz, himself openly gay, said yesterday "The ball is in the [Cradle of Liberty] council's court." Equality Advocates Pennsylvania, which promotes legal equality for sexual minorities and pressed the city on the scouts' lease, yesterday praised the Council vote. "We recognize the value of the Boy Scouts programs to some young people. They, however, should not be able to use taxpayers' dollars to discriminate against others," said executive director Stacey Sobel. 

Jubelirer said the Scouts felt "blindsided" by Council's action. "We had no idea this was coming today," he said they learned of the resolution from a lobbyist who was in council chambers when the resolution was introduced. "When the Fairmount Park commission voted to evict us [last July] we didn't get invited to the meeting. There's been a pattern of the city not giving us any information and doing things at the eleventh hour behind our backs." Councilman O'Neill said "This was too big an issue to have no hearing on," he said after the vote. "The Boy Scouts were negotiating in good faith. They were negotiating to be paid for the improvements they made to the building so they could start again somewhere else. "The local chapter was opposed to the national chapter's discrimination policy. I hate to see a group that agrees with us to be pushed out."

<h2>The future</h2>

The Boy Scouts can continue to use their building if they agree to pay market value rent. Jubelirer said the city has yet to tell the Cradle of Liberty Council what fair-market-value rent would be. Clarke said he opposes the fair-market-value rent alternative. "You should not be able to stay in a publicly funded facility without signing nondiscriminatory language regardless of whether you pay rent," he said.

Jubelirer said he did not know how scout officials would react and that any decision would likely involve leadership of the scout's National Council. "We walk a fine line between what National wants and what we want to do," Jubelirer said. 

In February 2007, Bill Dwyer, the Scout Executive, announced to the board and the staff that the council could not afford to keep up the legal fight to remain at 22nd and Winter, and there was not the community support to force the mayor to change his decision to evict the Scouts. 

Preparation began to abandon the building and build a new facility on private land. The new building will be built on along with the &lt;a href="w%3ASalvation%20Army"&gt;Salvation Army's&lt;/a&gt; new facilities in &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Philadelphia%2C%20Pennsylvania"&gt;North Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;.

<h3>Moderate earthquake shakes central Greece</h3>

A 5.3-&lt;a href="w%3AMoment%20magnitude%20scale"&gt;magnitude&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aearthquake"&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt; struck near &lt;a href="w%3APatras"&gt;Patras&lt;/a&gt; and its surrounding areas in central on Tuesday afternoon, just before 3 p.m. local time (1200 GMT). There were no reports of injuries or damage.

"The strong earthquake was measured at 5.3 with the epicenter on the edge of Trichonida lake, some 110 kilometres [70 miles] west of &lt;a href="w%3AAthens"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt;," an Athens Geodynamic Institute official said.

<h3>Flemish Minister-President will not call Armenian massacre 'genocide'</h3>
Minister-President of &lt;a href="w%3AFlanders"&gt;Flanders&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AYves%20Leterme"&gt;Yves Leterme&lt;/a&gt; in an interview with the &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt; newspaper &lt;a href="w%3AZaman%20%28newspaper%29"&gt;Zaman&lt;/a&gt; showed a hesitation to call the &lt;a href="w%3AArmenian%20Genocide"&gt;Armenian Genocide&lt;/a&gt; a genocide.

"Before a politician can judge if something is a genocide, the international institutions must speak out about it. ...As a politician it is not wise to speak about a genocide until experts have judged it. I don't stand alone with my view and I have nothing to add to this," Leterme said.

The matter of the so-called &lt;a href="w%3AArmenian%20Genocide"&gt;Armenian Genocide&lt;/a&gt; lies very sensitive with some Belgian voters of Turkish descent. The situation reminds of the Dutch elections, when &lt;a href="w%3AWouter%20Bos"&gt;Wouter Bos&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="w%3ALabour%20Party%20%28Netherlands%29"&gt;Dutch Labour Party&lt;/a&gt; (PvdA) refused to speak of an "Armenian genocide". The polls project that Leterme's party &lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20Democratic%20and%20Flemish"&gt;CD&amp;V&lt;/a&gt; is to become the biggest political party of Flanders in the &lt;a href="w%3ABelgian%20general%20election%2C%202007"&gt;upcoming federal elections in Belgium&lt;/a&gt; next Sunday.

<h3>Mudslide buries Valley of Geysers</h3>

 &lt;a href="w%3AValley%20of%20Geysers"&gt;Valley of Geysers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AEurasia"&gt;Eurasia's&lt;/a&gt; only &lt;a href="w%3Ageyser"&gt;geyser&lt;/a&gt; field and the second largest concentration of geysers in the world, was largely destroyed by a mudslide on Sunday. 

Millions of cubic meters of mud and rocks fell into the 6-kilometre-long basin, wiping out about two-thirds of the valley, which contains around 90 geysers and many hot springs. Located in the &lt;a href="w%3AKamchatka%20Peninsula"&gt;Kamchatka Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; in the Kronotsky Nature Reserve, the valley wasn't discovered until 1941, and had only opened to foreign tourists in 1991.

<h3>Back to the wild for pygmy kangaroos</h3>

's foresty ministry said Tuesday it will release 17 endangered &lt;a href="w%3APademelon"&gt;Dusky Pademelons&lt;/a&gt; into the wild in the remote &lt;a href="w%3APapua%20%28Indonesian%20province%29"&gt;Papua province&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Guinea"&gt;New Guinea&lt;/a&gt;.

Also known as pygmy kangaroos ♡❤(similar Red-Necked Pademelon pictured)♡❤, the animals have been rescued over time from illegal animal traders and from people's homes, where the little kangaroos were kept as pets. The species, Latin name ♡❤Thylogale brunii♡❤, belongs to a family of seven kangaroo-like mammals that are found in forests of Papua, &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20New%20Guinea"&gt;Western New Guinea&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APapua%20New%20Guinea"&gt;Papua New Guinea&lt;/a&gt;.

In a press release Monday, the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice"&gt;Department of Justice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (DOJ) detailed a federal grand jury indictment against &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Congress"&gt;Congressman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWilliam%20J.%20Jefferson"&gt;William Jefferson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on charges that included bribery, racketeering, and money laundering, among others.

The grand jury out of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAlexandria%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Alexandria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Virginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, charged Jefferson specifically with "solicitation of bribes, honest services wire fraud, money laundering, obstruction of justice, violating the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AForeign%20Corrupt%20Practices%20Act"&gt;Foreign Corrupt Practices Act&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , racketeering, and conspiracy." The indictment stems from corruption that is alleged to have taken place between August 2000 and August 2005.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;Representative&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Jefferson, 63, a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Democrat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALouisiana"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , is alleged to have "used his position and his office to corruptly seek, solicit and direct that things of value be paid to Jefferson and his family members in exchange for his performance of official acts to advance the interests of people and businesses who offered him the bribes." Jefferson has represented Louisiana's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALouisiana%27s%202nd%20congressional%20district"&gt;2nd congressional district&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; since 1991.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was involved in the investigation, which culminated in a raid on Representative Jefferson's congressional office in May, 2006. "The FBI has made combating public corruption its top criminal investigative priority because American citizens deserve honest and ethical public officials representing their interest,” said Kenneth W. Kaiser, Assistant Director, FBI Criminal Investigative Division. “As it is alleged, Congressman Jefferson violated the public’s trust and used his official position and office as a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARacketeer%20Influenced%20and%20Corrupt%20Organizations%20Act"&gt;RICO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; enterprise to corruptly solicit bribes, to pay off a foreign official, and to illegally benefit from overseas business transactions during a five-year period."

A complex series of transactions was alleged to have taken place, involving Jefferson and at least two other co-conspirators. Along with Jefferson, Vernon L. Jackson, a Louisville, Kentucky businessman, and Brett M. Pfeffer, a former Jefferson congressional staff member, "allegedly discussed and solicited bribes in return for being influenced in the performance of certain official acts, including receiving things of value from iGate [Inc.], Jackson’s company."

Jackson plead guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit bribery and the payment of bribes to a public official, and was sentenced to 87 months in prison. Pfeffer plead guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit bribery and aiding and abetting the solicitation of bribes by a member of Congress, and was sentenced to 96 months in prison.

Also detailed in the indictment, Jefferson allegedly offered payments to a foreign official to further his own business interest as well as that of his family. Jefferson was allegedly responsible for "negotiating, offering and delivering payments of bribes" to &lt;a href="Nigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;n officials. In an August 2005 raid on Jefferson's home in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , law enforcement officials found US$90,000 cash from an undercover operation in his freezer. The cash had been wrapped in aluminum foil and hidden inside frozen food containers.

Representative Jefferson has not responded directly to the indictment, but his lawyer, Robert Trout, stated that his client was innocent and would "fight this indictment and clear his name.” Acknowledging the comprehensive investigation carried out against his client, as detailed in the 94-page indictment, Trout pointed out that legislative action was not involved. “There is no suggestion that he promised anyone any appropriations,” said Trout. “There were no earmarks. There were no government contracts.”

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASpeaker%20of%20the%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;Speaker of the United States House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANancy%20Pelosi"&gt;Nancy Pelosi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; expressed some concern over the allegations. "The charges in the indictment against Congressman Jefferson are extremely serious,” said Pelosi. “While Mr. Jefferson, just as any other citizen, must be considered innocent until proven guilty, if these charges are proven true, they constitute an egregious and unacceptable abuse of public trust and power.” 

If found guilty of the charges ultimately, Representative Jefferson faces a maximum sentence of 235 years.

The &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20diplomatic%20missions"&gt;High Commission of Canada&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; is not granting ex-wife of &lt;a href="w%3ANelson%20Mandela"&gt;Nelson Mandela&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AWinnie%20Madikizela-Mandela"&gt;Winnie Madikizela-Mandela&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3Avisa"&gt;visa&lt;/a&gt; to enter &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;.

Her daughter, &lt;a href="w%3AZindzi%20Mandela"&gt;Zindzi Mandela&lt;/a&gt;, and two security guards were granted a visa.

There is no word as to why Canadian officials refused, but sources speculate that her conviction for being involved in the death of a 14-year-old activist, and other incidents, could be factors.

Madikizela-Mandela is a figure of debate because her supporters in the struggle against &lt;a href="w%3AHistory%20of%20South%20Africa%20in%20the%20apartheid%20era"&gt;apartheid&lt;/a&gt; were violent. In 1991, she was convicted for kidnapping. In 2003, she was convicted of fraud.

Immigration lawyer, Guidy Mamann, told ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACBC%20Radio"&gt;CBC Radio&lt;/a&gt;♡❤: "Generally, if you have a criminal record, you're not wanted in this country, either for permanent residence or to visit as a tourist."

Madikizela-Mandela, 73, was scheduled to speak at a fundraising gala and dinner in &lt;a href="w%3AToronto"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt;, on Tuesday at 6:30 p.m. ET. It was named "A Night in Soweto", and was presented by arts organization &lt;a href="w%3AMusicaNoir"&gt;MusicaNoir&lt;/a&gt;. According to CanadaNewsWire, &lt;a href="w%3AAfrican-American"&gt;African-American&lt;/a&gt; actor &lt;a href="w%3ALeVar%20Burton"&gt;LeVar Burton&lt;/a&gt; flew from &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles"&gt;Los Angeles, California&lt;/a&gt; to Toronto to fill in for Madikizela-Mandela.

An opera named "The Passion of Winnie", about the life of Madikizela-Mandela, is to be presented at Toronto's &lt;a href="w%3ALuminato%20Festival"&gt;Luminato Festival&lt;/a&gt; at 8:00 p.m ET on Friday. It is not known if Madikizela-Mandela will be granted a visa to attend the event.

Luminato's official website stated that it is "an event not to be missed", Madikizela-Mandela is a "fascinating and strong personality", and she demonstrates "rarely displayed true and charismatic leadership". Tickets for the event are CAN$200.

"I will regret not being at the show, I know, probably for the rest of my life because I've enjoyed it so much," said Barker, 83, who has been host of the show for 35 years.

The audience, who is also a pool of possible contestants, gave a round of applause and a standing ovation. Confetti was also sprayed about to celebrate his time with the show.

His final words were, "Help control the pet population. Have your pets spayed or neutered." Barker has said those words at the end of every show for many years. The show originated on September 4, 1972.

The finale will air on 15 June. A new host has yet to be determined but auditions have started in December 2006. The show and its staff have won six &lt;a href="w%3ADaytime%20Emmy%20Award"&gt;Daytime Emmy Awards&lt;/a&gt;. Barker has won seventeen &lt;a href="w%3AEmmy%20Awards"&gt;Emmy Awards&lt;/a&gt; for hosting the show.

Mike Svonavec, the owner of the land in Somerset County, &lt;a href="Pennsylvania"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Airlines"&gt;United Airlines&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Airlines%20Flight%2093"&gt;Flight 93&lt;/a&gt; crashed on September 11, 2001 has set a US$10 million price tag for his property, which is sought by the group, ♡❤Families of Flight 93♡❤ and the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Park%20Service"&gt;National Park Service&lt;/a&gt; for building a memorial dedicated to those on the plane. 

Svonavec says that the price is fair market value for the 273 acre property and the organization would not be charged for the exact site of the crash. The organization has offered to buy the land for no more than $500,000 at least three times.

Currently, the U.S. National Park Service only owns approximately 60 acres of the land. PBS Coals Inc. owns 864 acres of the land and Svonavec owns 273 acres. The entire field is nearly 2,000 acres.

The permanent memorial is estimated to cost $58 million and is scheduled to be constructed starting in 2008 or 2009. On the ten-year anniversary of 9/11, a ribbon will be cut at the site.

Svonavec has also placed a box on the crash site temporary memorial, where visitors can leave a "donation" to pay for his asking price for the land as well as the cost of providing security at the site. Funding was provided for the cost of security, but in February the funds were already used up and Svonavec says he can no longer afford to keep the land maintained and secure. Reports say that the security company that is currently in charge of security charges $10,000 per month. 

"That land has been paid for with 40 lives...the donation box is an insult to that cost. I think Svonavec believes his land, because it has the blood of my cousin and 39 other people, it's worth more," said Patrick White, Vice President, ♡❤Families of Flight 93♡❤.

&lt;a href="w%3ATropical%20Cyclone%20Gonu"&gt;Tropical Storm Gonu&lt;/a&gt; headed toward &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; today, after lashing &lt;a href="Oman"&gt;Oman&lt;/a&gt; for two days with high winds and torrential rains, and causing at least 23 deaths and the evacuation of more than 20,000 people to emergency shelters. Concern was high for the oil industry, as rough seas kept tankers from leaving their ports.

Such storms are rare in the Middle East. Early today, Gonu was weakening and was downgraded to a tropical storm. The &lt;a href="w%3AJoint%20Typhoon%20Warning%20Center"&gt;Joint Typhoon Warning Center&lt;/a&gt; projected the storm to continue weakening as it made landfall on Iran's southeastern coast. Offshore Iranian oil installations were expected to be spared, officials said.

<h3>Oman lashed</h3>
In the Omani capital, &lt;a href="w%3AMuscat"&gt;Muscat&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, there were torrential rains and howling winds, a rarity in the quiet coastal city. Streets were flooded and emergency vehicles were useless. Flights were canceled at Oman's &lt;a href="w%3ASeeb%20International%20Airport"&gt;Seeb International Airport&lt;/a&gt;.

Twenty-three deaths were reported by Omani authorities today. Electricity and phone lines were out and roads flooded. Police said a body washed ashore in Sur. There were also reports of people trapped in homes in low-lying areas of the capital.

Authorities used mobile-phone text messages to warn people away from dangerous areas. Residents were warned to stay at home, or seek shelter in buildings that could withstand the harsh weather.

Shareefa bint Khalfan, Omani minister of social development, said more than 20,000 people were evacuated to government shelters. 

At Oman's weather center, where records have been kept since 1890, metorologists said Gonu was likely the strongest storm to hit Oman since 1977. Milder tropical storms are common mid-May to late June.

<h3>Iran prepares</h3>
In Iran, hundreds of residents of Chabahr, a port on the &lt;a href="w%3AGulf%20of%20Oman"&gt;Gulf of Oman&lt;/a&gt;, were evacuated.

"University and school students were moved to higher ground in the area to avoid the cyclone effects," Hojjat Ali Shayanfar, head of emergency services in Sistan Baluchistan province, was quoted as saying by the Associated Press.

Some major roads were flooded in southeastern Iran. In the port city of &lt;a href="w%3ABandar%20Abbas"&gt;Bandar Abbas&lt;/a&gt;, winds shattered windows and knocked down billboards &amp; trees.

<h3>Impact on oil industry</h3>
Oman has relatively small oil fields, and there was little damage to them. But oil exports were cut off, as the raging seas kept tankers battened down in port for a third day today. To the north, at the world's third-largest shipping fuel center in &lt;a href="w%3AFujairah"&gt;Fujairah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20Arab%20Emirates"&gt;United Arab Emirates&lt;/a&gt;, all refueling and supply operations were suspended, and ships were kept in their berths. At the entrance to the &lt;a href="w%3APersian%20Gulf"&gt;Persian Gulf&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AStrait%20of%20Hormuz"&gt;Strait of Hormuz&lt;/a&gt;, ships passed through, despite four- to six-foot swells and strong winds. About one-fifth of the world's oil passes through this narrow chokepoint.

Iran, &lt;a href="w%3AOPEC"&gt;OPEC's&lt;/a&gt; No. 2 oil exporter, said the storm would not disrupt supplies because its main terminals were inside the Gulf waterway. Analysts were mixed on how the storm will affect prices at the gas pump.

"About 17-21 million barrels a day of oil are coming out of the Persian Gulf. Even if only some of the tankers are delayed, that could reduce the supply of oil and increase prices," Manouchehr Takin, at the Center for Global Energy Studies in London, was quoted as saying by the &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;.

But Tim Evans, an analyst at Citigroup Global Markets, said while the storm may delay oil tankers, they will eventually get to their destinations, so prices shouldn't be affected too drastically.

Oil prices rose US$0.25 to $65.86 a barrel in midday trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

<h3>Strongest cyclone</h3>
At its peak, Tropical Cyclone Gonu, named for a bag of palm leaves in the language of the &lt;a href="Maldives"&gt;Maldives&lt;/a&gt;, reached sustained winds of 240 kilometers an hour (149 miles per hour) . By early today, winds were around 83 km/h, and it was expect to keep weakening.

The storm is believed to be the strongest cyclone to hit the Arabian Peninsula since record-keeping started in 1945, and was tied for the strongest tropical cyclone in the northern &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Ocean"&gt;Indian Ocean&lt;/a&gt;, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.

Leaders from the 7 richest industrialised countries and &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; will have to deal with &lt;a href="Climate%20change"&gt;climate issues&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3A33rd%20G8%20summit"&gt;33rd G8 summit&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AHeiligendamm"&gt;Heiligendamm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;. While &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; and Germany are calling for quantifiable greenhouse gas emission cuts, the &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; believe that growing economies such as &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; would need to join in on such efforts.

German Chancellor &lt;a href="Angela%20Merkel"&gt;Angela Merkel&lt;/a&gt; at the G8 summit yesterday said the two main topics were climate change and combating poverty in Africa. She said her first talks with president Bush were good, and added: "I trust that we will work out joint positions on that." Bush acknowledged that he has "strong desire to work ... on a post-Kyoto agreement."
Merkel had proposed a 50% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 compared to 1990 levels, helping to keep global temperature rise to no more than 3.6°C. White House adviser James Connaughton however said that "At this point in time we are not prepared to adopt that proposal."

President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; finds himself in a position between the pressure from France and Germany, but on the other hand he wants to urge countries like India and China to join climate efforts. He told reporters that: "The United States can serve as a bridge between some nations who believe that now is the time to come up with a set goal … and those who are reluctant to participate in the dialogue. ... We all can make major strides, and yet there won't be a reduction until China and India are participants."

President Bush will defend his plan today to organise a separate conference on global warming with the 15 biggest polluters to set their own goals, and to rely on technological innovations to achieve part of the emission targets. When asked about the U.S. plans, Merkel said in a television interview that she didn't expect the differences to disappear overnight. At the G8 summit she said stated: "I think we all know that the goals agreed by the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; cannot be accepted by the entire world."

&lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;ese Prime Minister &lt;a href="Shinzo%20Abe"&gt;Shinzo Abe&lt;/a&gt; told reporters: "On climate change ...We agreed that Japan and the United States would be working together for the creation of an effective framework which is flexible, and that we would be cooperating to achieve that end in the future."

The new President of France &lt;a href="Nicolas%20Sarkozy"&gt;Nicolas Sarkozy&lt;/a&gt; wants the U.S. to increase their efforts on climate issues. He told reporters yesterday: "We need quantifiable targets in the final text. It is an extremely important point and I intend to talk to the president of the United States about it as early as this evening. ... President Bush has made a first effort, but we need to set ourselves targets to clearly show the determination of the G-8 to act and to obtain results... If we don't act now, it will be too late to avoid a disaster. It will cost less than if we wait."

A spokesman for Russian President &lt;a href="Vladimir%20Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; called the U.S. plans to deal with global warming "very pragmatic and interesting." &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="Romano%20Prodi"&gt;Romano Prodi&lt;/a&gt; recognised that "the American president has made comments in the last few days that have been more open than in the past." Prime Minister of the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Tony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; also welcomed the U.S. engagement for "substantial" reductions, which the U.S. is aiming for, according to a recent U.S. draft G8 document.

President of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso at the G8 summit said he thought the E.U. was taking a leading role in the climate debate, also by influencing the position of countries like the U.S. and China. He believes a global agreement to follow Kyoto is needed, possibly by 2009. He stressed that, as this was a problem created by all nations, effecting all, it had to be tackled within the UN-framework, and that agreements made by only a number of states would fall short of what is needed. He also doubted the possibility that hard numbers on emissions cuts would result from this summit.

Other topics at the G8 Summit will be development in &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; (including the fight against AIDS and malaria), the &lt;a href="w%3ADoha%20Development%20Round"&gt;Doha Round of the World Trade Organization&lt;/a&gt;, and the U.S. plans to set up a missile defence shield in &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;.

The U.S. is the only G8 country that has not ratified the &lt;a href="w%3AKyoto%20protocol"&gt;Kyoto protocol&lt;/a&gt;, which expires in 2012.

When the &lt;a href="w%3APhiladelphia%20City%20Council"&gt;Philadelphia City Council&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Philadelphia%20breaks%2080%20year%20old%20building%20lease%3B%20moves%20to%20evict%20Scouts"&gt;broke its 80 year old building lease&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href="w%3ACradle%20of%20Liberty%20Council"&gt;Cradle of Liberty Council&lt;/a&gt;, it set itself on a course to be the largest city in the nation without its own &lt;a href="w%3ABoy%20Scouts%20of%20America"&gt;Boy Scout&lt;/a&gt; building. The scouts must abandon their building before the end of July. Local scouts now have to go to suburbs for services.

<h2>Background</h2>
With the eviction of the Cradle of Liberty Council, Philadelphia, the &lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20United%20States%20cities%20by%20population"&gt;fifth largest city in the nation&lt;/a&gt;, is the only one without its own Scout building. The four largest cities are each served respectively by their own council: &lt;a href="w%3AGreater%20New%20York%20Councils"&gt;Greater New York Councils&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20Area%20Council"&gt;Los Angeles Area Council&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="w%3AChicago%20Area%20Council"&gt;Chicago Area Council&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ASam%20Houston%20Area%20Council"&gt;Sam Houston Area Council&lt;/a&gt;. Cities six through ten have council offices within their city limits as well (Phoenix, San Antonio, San Diego, Dallas and San Jose).

The Philadelphia-based council is the seventh largest in the nation. The top five are &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHouston%2C%20Texas"&gt;Houston&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3ABaltimore-Washington%20Metropolitan%20Area"&gt;Washington-BaltimoreArea&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Capital%20Area%20Council"&gt;National Capital Area Council&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="w%3ASaint%20Paul%2C%20Minnesota"&gt;Saint Paul&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Star%20Council"&gt;Northern Star Council&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href="w%3ASalt%20Lake%20City%2C%20Utah"&gt;Salt Lake City&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AGreat%20Salt%20Lake%20Council"&gt;Great Salt Lake Council&lt;/a&gt;).

In December 1928 the City of Philadelphia gave the &lt;a href="w%3APhiladelphia%20Council"&gt;Philadelphia Council&lt;/a&gt; permission to build a headquarters on city-owned land at 22nd and Spring Streets in &lt;a href="w%3AFairmount%20Park"&gt;Fairmount Park&lt;/a&gt;. The Scouts built their headquarters at their own expense and, complying with the terms of the agreement, immediately turned over the property to the city. In return they remained housed in their building rent free "in perpetuity."

The &lt;a href="w%3ABeaux-Arts%20architecture"&gt;Beaux Arts&lt;/a&gt; style building built in 1929 was designed by architect &lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Klauder"&gt;Charles Klauder&lt;/a&gt;. Located at 22nd and Winter Streets it is eligible to be listed on the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places"&gt;National Register of Historic Places&lt;/a&gt;. Having lost the use of the land and building on the &lt;a href="w%3ABenjamin%20Franklin%20Parkway"&gt;Benjamin Franklin Parkway&lt;/a&gt; given to the council, it will operate out of its suburban office in &lt;a href="w%3AWayne%2C%20Pennsylvania"&gt;Wayne, Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;. This office is 21 miles outside of &lt;a href="w%3ACenter%20City%2C%20Philadelphia"&gt;Center City&lt;/a&gt;, considered the heart of the &lt;a href="w%3ADelaware%20Valley"&gt;Delaware Valley&lt;/a&gt;.

The eviction of the council is due to the &lt;a href="w%3ABoy%20Scouts%20of%20America%20membership%20controversies"&gt;controversies&lt;/a&gt; over the issue of avowed homosexuals being leaders in the Boy Scouts. The city of Philadelphia does not allow discrimination against openly gay people, and the Scouts have asserted that under the &lt;a href="w%3AFirst%20Amendment%23Petition%20and%20assembly"&gt;First Amendment&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFreedom%20of%20assembly"&gt;Freedom of assembly&lt;/a&gt; they can exclude people who don’t meet their membership standards.

There is no word about the Scouts future plans in Philadelphia and Scout officials have not yet commented on it. The council is still recovering from the loss of &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Way"&gt;United Way&lt;/a&gt; funding in 2003.

On June 7, Mike Svonavec, the owner of the land in Somerset County, &lt;a href="Pennsylvania"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Airlines"&gt;United Airlines&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Airlines%20Flight%2093"&gt;Flight 93&lt;/a&gt; crashed on September 11, 2001 has a US$10 million price tag for his property which is sought by the group, ♡❤Families of Flight 93♡❤ and the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Park%20Service"&gt;National Park Service&lt;/a&gt;, (NPS) for building a memorial dedicated to those on the plane. Svonavec also placed a box on the crash site temporary memorial, where visitors can leave a "donation" to pay for his asking price for the land as well as the cost of providing security at the site.

The NPS has covered the donation box with a trash bag and told Svonavec in a letter to remove it by the end of Friday June 8, but Svonavec said that he will not remove the box.

"I have no intentions of removing the box from my property. My only plans are to try to cooperate with the Park Service with regard to the sale of the property," said Svonavec.

Svonavec accused the NPS of trying to take over his property after they placed the bag over the box.

"It's just unbelievable to my mind that that's the direction they would take, taking control of the property like a guest would at your house," added Svonavec.

"The bottom line is we feel the National Park Service can't effectively carry out our mission without exercising the exclusive use and control of the site as provided for in our agreement with the property owners," said Joanne Hanley who is the Superintendent of the memorial.

Although NPS tour guides are telling tourists and others who visit the memorial, they are shocked to learn that the money they donate is going to Svonavec and not the memorial. "They're alarmed that they may have given their money to something that they didn't want to give their money to," said one of the 43 guides who volunteer at the memorial, Donna Glessner.

The land is currently under contract with the NPS and the memorial is allowed to be on the land according to an act of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Congress"&gt;United States Congress&lt;/a&gt; who in 2002 authorized the memorial to be placed on the land.

Currently, the U.S. National Park Service only owns approximately 60 acres of the land. PBS Coals Inc. owns 864 acres of the land and Svonavec owns 273 acres. The entire field is nearly 2,000 acres.

The &lt;a href="w%3AChurch%20of%20England"&gt;Church of England&lt;/a&gt; has threatened legal action against &lt;a href="w%3ASony%20Entertainment"&gt;Sony Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; over the inclusion of the &lt;a href="w%3AManchester%20Cathedral"&gt;Manchester Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3APS3"&gt;PS3&lt;/a&gt; launch title &lt;a href="w%3AResistance%3A%20Fall%20of%20Man"&gt;Resistance: Fall of Man&lt;/a&gt;. The game, set in various English locations during an alternate history, includes a gun fight within the building. 

The scene in question involves a small group of humans, including the player, taking refuge in the cathedral and attempting to fight off aliens who are attacking them.

The Church has requested an apology, saying that Sony did not ask for permission to include the Cathedral in the game, describing the game as "sick and sacrilegious". The Dean of Manchester Cathedral criticised Sony for failing to take into account Manchester's gun crime problems, saying "it is a shame to have Sony undermining our work". 

Meanwhile, a spokesman for Sony defended the game, telling the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ADaily%20Telegraph"&gt;Daily Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, "[the game] is not based on reality at all" and compared it to the fictional series ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ADoctor%20Who"&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

The Church will send a letter directly to Sony on Monday requesting an apology and withdrawal of the game from sale.

&lt;a href="w%3ADark%20Floors"&gt;Dark Floors&lt;/a&gt;, a horror film under production in Northern &lt;a href="Finland"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt; and starring the &lt;a href="w%3Ahard%20rock"&gt;hard rock&lt;/a&gt; band &lt;a href="w%3ALordi"&gt;Lordi&lt;/a&gt; (who are famed for their &lt;a href="w%3Amonster"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt; costumes and lyrical themes), has received €300,000 (£200,000) funding from the &lt;a href="w%3APolitics%20of%20Finnland"&gt;Finnish government&lt;/a&gt;.

Lordi are also famed for their record-breaking 292 point victory in the &lt;a href="w%3AEurovision%20Song%20Contest%202006"&gt;Eurovision Song Contest 2006&lt;/a&gt; with their song ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AHard%20Rock%20Hallelujah"&gt;Hard Rock Hallelujah&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. It was also the first time a hard rock song had won the contest, and Finland's first ever victory.

The film is being shot in English, with a largely Finnish cast, and has a production cost of €4.2 million (£2.84 million). The plot features a "monster attack" on the world, with a young &lt;a href="w%3Aautism"&gt;Autistic&lt;/a&gt; girl being the only person in a position to save it.

Lead singer Mr Lordi said that as their masks and costumes were derived from horror films it was "kind of natural" that they should make their own.

A cricket team made up of Bollywood celebrities has beaten a Yorkshire opposition in a charity cricket match at &lt;a href="w%3AHeadingley%20Stadium"&gt;Headingley&lt;/a&gt;, held as part of the &lt;a href="w%3AIIFA"&gt;International Indian Film Academy&lt;/a&gt; ("IIFA") Weekend in Yorkshire, England, celebrating Indian cinema and its stars.

The "Bolly 11" team, consisting of Indian actors and cricketers, took on the Yorkshire 11 which featured former English cricketers, British TV stars and musicians and two members of Parliament.

Amitabh Bachchan, film legend and IIFA Brand Ambassador inaugurated the event, followed by actor Salman Khan, and Shilpa Shetty who greeted excited fans. Shetty supervised the toss and then conducted a walkabout of the grounds, signing autographs.

The A-list Bolly team was made up of Saif Ali Khan (captain), Arjun Rampal, Dino Moreo, Fardeen Khan, Aftab Shivadasani, Ritesh Deshmukh, Sohail Khan, Arshad Warsi, Boman Irani, Upen Patel, Arbaaz Khan, Vishal Bhardwaj, Kapil Dev and Mohammed Azharuddin.

The Yorkshire team displayed the talents of Nick Knowles, Rosalie Birch, Gladstone Small, Devon Malcolm, Jay Sean, Sherwin Campbell, Chris Lewis, Danny McGuire, Harry Gration, Greg Wise, Manish Bhasin, Ajmal Shahzad, Andew Gale, Colin Salmon, Oliver Milburn and MPs Keith Vaz and Shahid Malik.

The match also saw the return to the square of the ever popular and highly respected Yorkshireman, (Harold) "Dickie" Bird, who umpired with Jack Hampshire.

The game was a light-hearted affair with fans and supporters cheering on the players for both teams. The overall mood was festive with Mexican waves, song and dance and Indian and Pakistani flags being waved. In cricketing spirit, banners featuring slogans "Bollywood Team to Win" and "4" filled the Headingley Carnegie Stadium as the game went on.

The IIFA XI won the match after former Indian captain Kapil Dev hit a boundary off the last ball to score the winning runs. The Yorkshire XI had scored 142 in 20 overs. The Bollywood team scored 143.

Other celebrities in attendance were Aishwarya Rai, Bipasha Basu, Govinda, Kabir Bedi, Randhir Kapoor, Rakesh Roshan, and director J.P. Dutta along with Myleene Klass and Brit-Asian female rapper Hard Kaur. 

Money raised from the match is to be donated to the IIFA Foundation.

A woman, reported to be an expert in martial arts, has been shot dead by police in a car park behind ♡❤M&amp;Co♡❤, a women's clothing shop in Sevenoaks, &lt;a href="w%3AKent"&gt;Kent, England&lt;/a&gt;. According to reports, the woman pulled a gun on police who then shot her.

"I can confirm that in the early hours of this morning Kent Police fatally shot a person. This has been referred to the IPCC which has a team of investigators now at the scene," said a spokesman for the &lt;a href="w%3AIndependent%20Police%20Complaints%20Commission"&gt;Independent Police Complaints Commission&lt;/a&gt; (IPCC).

A bus station in &lt;a href="w%3ASevenoaks"&gt;Sevenoaks&lt;/a&gt; was shut down and closed off to the public while police investigated the incident. A tent was placed over the crime scene to ensure that evidence was kept intact.

Regular police officers do not carry guns in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AAuthorised%20Firearms%20Officer"&gt;Special officers&lt;/a&gt; are dispatched to scenes with guns only if situations become serious or dangerous.

After meeting Sunday with &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; Foreign Minister &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABernard%20Kouchner"&gt;Bernard Kouchner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Chad"&gt;Chad&lt;/a&gt;ian President &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIdriss%20D%C3%A9by"&gt;Idriss Déby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; opened the door to the possible deployment of &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; (UN) or &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; (EU) troops to Chad's volatile eastern region. Yesterday, Kouchner met with &lt;a href="Sudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt;'s President &lt;a href="Omar%20al-Bashir"&gt;Omar al-Bashir&lt;/a&gt;.

Until Sunday, Chad had rejected the idea of allowing military troops in to assist with security at its border with &lt;a href="Sudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt;. In Chad's eastern region, the government has been fighting an insurgency, which it claims has been supported by Sudan. While dealing with the insurgency, Chad had been amenable to an international police presence, but not a military force. 

An estimated 234,000 Sudanese refugees have fled the violence in the &lt;a href="Darfur"&gt;Darfur&lt;/a&gt; region of Sudan and crossed the border into Chad. In addition, Chad is coping with an estimated 150,000 internally displaced persons. The conditions in the camps set up to deal with the refugees have been criticised as inadequate by the aid group, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AM%C3%A9decins%20Sans%20Fronti%C3%A8res"&gt;Médecins Sans Frontières&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (MSF).

France's newly appointed foreign minister, and co-founder of MSF, Bernard Kouchner, and Chad's President Déby were able to work out some concessions on the use of foreign troops. Following the meeting, Déby was asked by reporters whether he would allow UN or EU military troops to take a role in security and stabilization measures for a humanitarian mission. "Why not," Déby replied.

Déby revealed that plans for an international force for Chad would be made public by the end of June. "We are agreed on the principle of deploying a force, but there are still some points to resolve, on which we must agree," said Déby. "The results of the discussions will be made public before the 25th of this month."

"We have been proposing this to the international community since 2004," said Déby. But Chad's Prime Minister, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADelwa%20Kassir%C3%A9%20Koumakoye"&gt;Delwa Kassiré Koumakoye&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , commented recently that neighbouring countries may take the use of foreign troops as a threat.

On June 9, MSF issued a press release warning of a humanitarian crisis developing in Chad. "It is imperative that the emergency in eastern Chad be fully recognised, that aid organisations provide massive, immediate aid to the IDPs and that the Chadian authorities facilitate humanitarian aid," said Isabelle Defourny, manager of MSF programmes in Chad.

<h3>Progress in Sudan</h3>
 &lt;span style="display:none"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
Following his visit to Chad, Foreign Minister Kouchner traveled to Sudan where he met with Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir. Sudan has, in the past, rejected the deployment of an international force, and has resisted the use of a UN-African Union (AU) force. During their meeting Monday, al-Bashir told Kouchner that he would only accept troops from Africa.

Kouchner indicated that his meetings with al-Bashir and other officials had been productive and would "lift a certain number of complications" in obtaining agreements with Sudan. He and al-Bashir also discussed the unilateral sanctions imposed on Sudan by the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. Kouchner felt that the sanctions haven't been useful and that the Sudanese "seem clearly affected by this issue, considering how much they raised it."

UN Secretary-General &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABan%20Ki-moon"&gt;Ban Ki-moon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; expressed some optimism on the issue of troop deployment and acknowledged he received a letter recently from al-Bashir on the matter. As stated in the letter, al-Bashir has accepted in principal the idea of a UN-AU force of 23,000 troops to be stationed in Darfur. "I sincerely hope that we will be able to have early resolution of this issue," said Ban.

One roadblock may be al-Bashir's refusal to accept any force other than African. The UN and AU stated they would attempt to use only African troops, but indicated that non-African troops may be used if that were not possible.

"Darfur cannot be only an African problem," said Kouchner. "At a certain level, the respect for human rights concerns the whole world."

<h1>BT's Lalani smashes through the £1m salary barrier</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=BT%27s%20Lalani%20smashes%20through%20the%20%C2%A31m%20salary%20barrier&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

After a pay rise of over 40% last year, BT's chief financial officer, Hanif Lalani, has become one of the very few UK financial directors whose remuneration exceeds £1 million. 

Said to be endowed with an 'enterpreneurial spirit', Lalani has been a key contributor to BT plc, whose core strategy in recent years has been to reduce its dependence on traditional voice revenues and instead obtain an increasing portion of its turnover from so-called ♡❤New Wave♡❤ revenues. At the heart of this strategy is BT Global Services, which has won many significant contracts in the commercial and public sectors, in part through its portrayal as a "momentum story".

There is, however, increasing disquiet among analysts that the annual growth of the Global Services business has been unimpressive, and that BT has been using prior year adjustments to achieve favourable growth figures, for example in page 24 of http://www.btplc.com/News/ResultsPDF/q307release.pdf . 

Take the quarter ended 30th September 2005, for example. At the time, BT said the external revenues of its Global Services division were £1,740m. However, a year later, BT revised this figure downwards to £1,703m. This enabled BT to claim growth of 3.5%, instead of the dismal 1.3% it would have been forced to announce if it hadn't adjusted the prior year's figures.

BT has made a habit of adjusting the previous year's revenue figure every quarter. Only once in the past year has BT adjusted the figure upwards rather than downwards, and then it was by a tiny amount.

BT does not provide a justification for these prior year adjustments in its quarterly reports, but there can be no doubt that it is using these adjustments to make anaemic growth figures look acceptable. It could be an opportune moment for City analysts to ask Lalani some searching questions.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=European%20Union%20to%20fund%20scheme%20to%20reduce%20aircraft%20emissions%20and%20noise%20pollution&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; (EU) has announced plans to fund a private-public scheme dubbed "Clean Sky" to reduce aircraft emissions and &lt;a href="w%3Anoise%20pollution"&gt;noise pollution&lt;/a&gt; in European aircraft. Officials claim that the project will have large-scale economic benefits, will reduce &lt;a href="w%3Ajet%20engine"&gt;jet engine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Acarbon"&gt;carbon&lt;/a&gt; emissions by 20 to 40 percent and will therefore offset the large growth in commercial air travel. The proposal comes at a time when European officials are under heavy criticism for not doing enough to reduce aircraft emissions.

The new proposal is outlined in a document that is reported to be likely to be passed by the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Commission"&gt;European Commission&lt;/a&gt;. The document says that "Not launching Clean Sky soon will put the European industry in a position of competitive disadvantage, with negative repercussions not only for the industry itself but also for the EU as a whole," and goes on to point out that the US has a comparable scheme, the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Aeronautics%20Research%20and%20Development%20Policy"&gt;National Aeronautics Research and Development Policy&lt;/a&gt;, and points out that progress is beginning to be made in the area by &lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;. The paper also highlights the need for public spending in the scheme to ensure it does not fall behind international development. The commission has argued that "the present value, at 2006 prices, of the cumulative direct effect over the period 2010-2035 of Clean Sky on economic output in the EU has been estimated to approximately €100 billion to €160 billion reflecting increased operating profits, labor expenditures, capital investment and other direct effects."

The proposal calls for the aviation industry to contribute €800 million between 2008 and 2014, with companies such as &lt;a href="w%3AAirbus"&gt;Airbus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARolls-Royce"&gt;Rolls-Royce&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASaab"&gt;Saab&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AThales"&gt;Thales&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADassault"&gt;Dassault&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AEurocopter"&gt;Eurocopter&lt;/a&gt;. Universities and research institutions have also pledged support. The funding will be matched with public money from the EU, making the total cost €1.6 billion.

As well as approval by the European Commission, the plan requires approval by the individual EU member states. &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt;, though infamously skeptical of large EU projects, has already voiced its support, along with several other countries.

If the project goes ahead, funding will be split between six separate main initiatives, including a "greener" engine, a "smart" &lt;a href="w%3Afixed-wing%20aircraft"&gt;fixed wing&lt;/a&gt; that continually readjusts itself to maintain best fuel economy, and research regarding lighter materials that could be used to replace metals in aircraft bodies and components.

According to current estimates, the 20 to 40 percent carbon emissions reduction will mean a reduction of two to three billion tons between 2015 and 2050, and the project will also reduce &lt;a href="w%3Anitrogen%20oxide"&gt;nitrogen oxide&lt;/a&gt; emissions by 40 to 60 percent in the same time frame, as well as causing a 50 percent reduction in "perceived aircraft noise."

<h3>80th bird-flu death confirmed in Indonesia</h3>

A 29-year-old man in &lt;a href="w%3ARiau"&gt;Riau&lt;/a&gt; was confirmed today to have died of the &lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt; strain of &lt;a href="avian%20flu"&gt;avian flu&lt;/a&gt;, making him the 80th person in &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; to die from the virus.

"Before showing bird flu symptoms, he slaughtered and cooked sick chickens," Muhammad Nadirin of the Health Ministry's Bird Flu Center was quoted as saying by &lt;a href="w%3AKyodo%20News"&gt;Kyodo News&lt;/a&gt;.

Indonesia has the highest number of human deaths from H5N1, and the highest number of cases at 100.

Reports also say that &lt;a href="w%3AFatah"&gt;Fatah&lt;/a&gt; members fled the compound just before it was attacked.

Later yesterday, the federal grand jury &lt;a href="w%3ASacramento%2C%20California"&gt;Sacramento&lt;/a&gt; handed down &lt;a href="w%3AIndictment"&gt;indictments&lt;/a&gt; for the 11 men, including former Royal Lao Army general and &lt;a href="w%3AHmong%20people"&gt;Hmong&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href="w%3AVang%20Pao"&gt;Vang Pao&lt;/a&gt;.

Dang Vang, 48, was arrested at his Fresno home in an early morning raid by agents from the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Bureau%20of%20Alcohol%2C%20Tobacco%2C%20Firearms%20and%20Explosives"&gt;United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives&lt;/a&gt;, or ATF.

Dang Vang, Vang Pao and the others are charged with violating the U.S. Neutrality Act, which outlaws using United States soil to conspire to overthrow a foreign government that has peaceful relations with the U.S.

"Federal law is without equivocation: you cannot conspire to overthrow a foreign government with whom our nation is at peace," U.S. Attorney McGregor Scott said in a statement to reporters.

According to the ATF, Dang Vang put the group's "action plan" to paper, summarizing its plot to blow up government buildings in Laos and assassinate government officials. The plot even had a name: "Operation Popcorn," or "Political Opposition Party's Coup Operation to Rescue a Nation."
In addition to the 77-year-old Vang Pao and Dang Vang, 48, those charged are:

</ul>
Most of the men indicted are prominent members of the Hmong immigrant community in California's Central Valley. They were arrested last week in a sting operation as the group was trying to purchase a rifles, missiles, rocket launchers, mines and explosives from an ATF agent posing as an arms dealer.

In an 88-page criminal complaint, federal prosecutors detailed the plot, which included airlifting the weapons to &lt;a href="Thailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;, and had an estimated cost of US$27.9 million. Funds for the operation were raised from donations by the Hmong community and other supporters of Vang Pao from across the U.S.

During the 1960s and '70s, Vang Pao led a covert army of Hmong people, backed by the U.S. &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Intelligence%20Agency"&gt;Central Intelligence Agency&lt;/a&gt;, against communist forces in the &lt;a href="w%3ALaotian%20Civil%20War"&gt;Laotian Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, or "Secret War", which paralleled the &lt;a href="w%3AVietnam%20War"&gt;U.S. war in Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;.

Since the communist takeover of Laos in 1975, according to a March 2007 report by &lt;a href="w%3AAmnesty%20International"&gt;Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt;, Hmong people in Laos have taken to hiding in the mountains, on the run from a government that persecutes them for their role in the war.

U.S.-Laos diplomatic relations were strengthened in 1992, and in 2004, President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; extended normal trade relations to the southeast Asian country.

Last week a presentation of the bridge linking the &lt;a href="w%3ACrimea"&gt;Crimea&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href="w%3AKrasnodar%20Krai"&gt;Krasnodar region&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; took place in &lt;a href="Ukraine"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;. The project cost of the deal is estimated at US$480 million. According to specialists, the bridge can be built within two years given adequate preparation.

The bridge project includes building a highway with the width of 15 metres; there will also be a possibility of the bridge supporting a future oil pipeline. The total length of the bridge will be about 4.5 kilometres.

The bridge over the &lt;a href="w%3AStrait%20of%20Kerch"&gt;Strait of Kerch&lt;/a&gt; could become a transit way to more than 10 million people a year and should decrease the travel distance from Ukraine to the Krasnodar Region by 450 kilometres.

&lt;a href="w%3ADurham%20County"&gt;Durham County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Carolina"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Adistrict%20attorney"&gt;district attorney&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Nifong"&gt;Mike Nifong&lt;/a&gt; had his law license revoked Saturday, after a week of hearings by the North Carolina state bar. The hearing came after the state bar charged Nifong with &lt;a href="w%3Aethic"&gt;ethics&lt;/a&gt; violations, and for breaking several rules of professional conduct, during the alleged &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Duke%20University%20lacrosse%20case"&gt;2006 Duke University lacrosse case&lt;/a&gt;. Addionally, Nifong was charged with making inappropriate statements to the media, and ignoring evidence in favor of the defendants.

Nifong said Friday he would resign, regardless of the outcome of the hearing. He would also not appeal any punishment imposed by the state bar, according to his attorney. Nifong charged three players, Dave Evans, Reade Seligmann and Collin Finnerty, with rape. North Carolina attorney general Roy Cooper later concluded that the three players were innocent.

Nifong was said to have made "multiple, egregious mistakes" as he pursued the charges, but not intentionally, according to his attorney .

Nifong said he regretted some of what he said, such as that he wouldn’t allow Durham to become known for “a bunch of lacrosse players from Duke raping a black girl.”

Attorneys for the players said they would seek charges for criminal contempt against Nifong.

"This matter has been a fiasco. There's no doubt about it," said state bar committee chairman F. Lane Williamson.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Transportation%20Safety%20Board"&gt;National Transportation Safety Board&lt;/a&gt; (NTSB), the agency responsible for investigating transportation accidents in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, released updates on three major investigations on June 14.

The NTSB, well known publicly for its involvement in the investigation of &lt;a href="w%3Aaviation%20accidents%20and%20incidents"&gt;aviation incidents&lt;/a&gt; which involve harm or loss of human life, is also an agency that oversees the transportation of refined petroleum and gas products, chemicals and minerals. 

The agency determined the cause of a natural gas pipeline explosion that killed six. It also detailed the cause of an accidental release of 204,000 gallons of &lt;a href="w%3Aanhydrous%20ammonia"&gt;anhydrous ammonia&lt;/a&gt; from a pipeline in an environmentally sensitive area, and released preliminary information involving two commercial aircraft coming within 30-50 &lt;a href="w%3Afoot%20%28unit%20of%20length%29"&gt;feet&lt;/a&gt; of each other on a &lt;a href="w%3Arunway%20incursion"&gt;runway&lt;/a&gt;.

<h3>Pipeline explosion</h3>
In the gas explosion disaster, the towing vessel Miss Megan, which was of specifications that did not require inspection by the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Coast%20Guard"&gt;United States Coast Guard&lt;/a&gt;, was being operated in the West Cote Blanche Bay oil field in &lt;a href="w%3ALouisiana"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; by Central Boat Rentals on behalf of Athena Construction on October 12, 2006. The Miss Megan was pushing barge IBR 234, which was tied along the starboard side of barge Athena 106, en route to a &lt;a href="w%3Apile-driving"&gt;pile-driving&lt;/a&gt; location. Athena Construction did not require its crews to pin mooring spuds (vertical steel shafts extending through wells in the bottom of the boat and used for mooring) securely in place on its barges and consequently this had not been done. During the journey, the aft spud on the Athena 106 released from its fully raised position. The spud dropped into the water and struck a submerged, high-pressure natural gas pipeline. The resulting gas released ignited and created a fireball that engulfed the towing vessel and both barges. The master of the towing vessel and four barge workers were killed. The Miss Megan deckhand and one barge worker survived. One barge worker is officially listed as missing.

The NTSB blames Athena Construction for the disaster, citing in the final report that Athena Construction's manual contained no procedures mandating the use of the safety devices on the spud winch except during electrical work. It was found that if the Athena 106 crew had used the steel pins to secure the retracted spuds during their transit, a pin would have prevented the aft spud from accidentally deploying. Furthermore, the spud would have remained locked in its lifted position regardless of whether the winch brake mechanism, the spud's supporting cable, or a piece of connecting hardware had failed.

The NTSB also found that contributing to the accident was the failure of Central Boat Rentals to require, and the Miss Megan master to ensure, that the barge spuds were securely pinned before getting under way. The Board noted that investigators found no evidence that the Miss Megan master or deckhand checked whether the spuds had been properly secured before the tow began. While Central Boat Rentals had a health and safety manual and trained its crews, the written procedures did not specifically warn masters about the need to secure spuds or other barge equipment before navigating. The NTSB stated that the company's crew should have been trained to identify potential safety hazards on vessels under their control.

NTSB Chairman Mark Rosenker said of the investigation's results, "Having more rigorous requirements in place could have prevented this accident from occurring. Not only do these regulations need to be put in place but it is imperative that they are enforced and adhered to."

The NTSB has made a number of safety recommendations as a result of this accident and the subsequent investigation. Recommendations were made to Athena Construction and Central Boat Rentals to develop procedures and train the employees of its barges to use the securing pins to hold spuds safely in place before transiting from one site to another.

The most major of the other recommendations are:

To the &lt;a href="w%3AOccupational%20Safety%20and%20Health%20Administration"&gt;Occupational Safety and Health Administration&lt;/a&gt;:

<ul>
BULLET::::- Direct the &lt;a href="w%3AMaritime%20Advisory%20Committee%20for%20Occupational%20Safety%20and%20Health"&gt;Maritime Advisory Committee for Occupational Safety and Health&lt;/a&gt; to issue the following documents document to the maritime industry: (1) a fact sheet regarding the accident, and (2) a guidance document regarding the need to secure the gear on barges, including spud pins, before the barges are moved, and detailing any changes to your memorandum of understanding with the Coast Guard.

</ul>
To the U. S. Coast Guard

<ul>
BULLET::::- Finalize and implement the new towing vessel inspection regulations and require the establishment of safety management systems appropriate for the characteristics, methods of operation, and nature of service of towing vessels.
BULLET::::- Review and update your memorandum of understanding with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to specifically address your respective oversight roles on vessels that are not subject to Coast Guard inspection.

</ul>
<h3>Anhydrous ammonia spill</h3>
The NTSB also released the result of its investigation into an &lt;a href="w%3Aenvironmental%20disaster"&gt;environmental disaster&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AKansas"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt; on October 27, 2004 in which 204,000 gallons (4,858 barrels) of anhydrous ammonia was spilled from a ruptured pipeline in &lt;a href="w%3AKingman%2C%20Kansas"&gt;Kingman&lt;/a&gt; into an environmentally sensitive area. Chemicals from the pipeline entered a nearby stream and killed more than 25,000 fish, including some fish from &lt;a href="w%3Aendangered%20species"&gt;threatened species&lt;/a&gt;.

The incident reached the scale that it did due to operator error after the initial rupture. The 8 5/8-inch diameter steel pipeline, which was operated by Enterprise Products Operating L.P., burst at 11:15 a.m. in an agricultural area about 6 miles east of Kingman, Kansas. A drop in pipeline pressure, indicating abnormal conditions or a possible compromise in pipeline integrity, set off alarms displayed on the computerized pipeline monitoring system. Shortly after the first alarm the pipeline controller, in an attempt to remedy the low pressure, increased the flow of anhydrous ammonia into the affected section of pipeline. A total of 33 minutes elapsed between the time when the first alarm indicated a problem with the pipeline and the initiation of a shutdown.

In its initial report to the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Response%20Center"&gt;National Response Center&lt;/a&gt; (NRC), the pipeline operator's accident reporting contractor reported a release of at least 20 gallons of ammonia, telling the NRC that an updated estimate of material released would be reported at a later time. No such report was ever made. Because of the inaccurate report, the arrival of representatives from the &lt;a href="w%3AEnvironmental%20Protection%20Agency"&gt;Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/a&gt; was delayed by a full day, affecting the oversight of the environmental damage mitigation efforts.

The cause of the rupture itself was determined to be a pipe gouge created by heavy equipment damage to the pipeline during construction in 1973 or subsequent excavation activity at an unknown time that initiated &lt;a href="w%3Ametal%20fatigue"&gt;metal fatigue&lt;/a&gt; cracking and led to the eventual rupture of the pipeline.

"We are very fortunate that such highly toxic chemicals of the size and scope involved in this accident were not released in a populated area," commented Rosenker. "Had this same quantity of ammonia been released near a town or city, the results could have been catastrophic."

As a result of this accident, the NTSB made the following safety recommendations:

To the &lt;a href="w%3APipeline%20and%20Hazardous%20Materials%20Safety%20Administration"&gt;Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration&lt;/a&gt;:

<ul>
BULLET::::- Require that a pipeline operator must have a procedure to calculate and provide a reasonable initial estimate of released product in the telephonic report to the National Response Center.
BULLET::::- Require that a pipeline operator must provide an additional telephonic report to the National Response Center if significant new information becomes available during the emergency response.
BULLET::::- Require an operator to revise its pipeline risk assessment plan whenever it has failed to consider one of more risk factors that can affect pipeline integrity.

</ul>
To Enterprise Products Operating L.P.:

<ul>
BULLET::::- Provide initial and recurrent training for all controllers that includes simulator or noncomputerized simulations of abnormal operating conditions that indicate pipeline leaks.
</ul>
"The severity of this release of dangerous chemicals into the community could have been prevented," said Rosenker. "The safety recommendations that we have made, if acted upon, will reduce the likelihood of this type of accident happening again."

<h3>Runway incursion</h3>
As well as concluding their investigation of the above accidents, the NTSB also released preliminary information regarding a serious &lt;a href="w%3Arunway%20incursion"&gt;runway incursion&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco%20International%20Airport"&gt;San Francisco International Airport&lt;/a&gt; between two commercial aircraft on May 26, 2007.

At about 1:30 p.m. the &lt;a href="w%3Aair%20traffic%20control%20tower"&gt;tower&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aair%20traffic%20control"&gt;air traffic controller&lt;/a&gt; cleared &lt;a href="w%3ASkyWest%20Airlines"&gt;SkyWest Airlines&lt;/a&gt; flight 5741, an &lt;a href="w%3AEmbraer%20120"&gt;Embraer 120&lt;/a&gt; arriving from &lt;a href="w%3AModesto"&gt;Modesto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, to land on runway 28R. Forgetting about the arrival airplane, the same controller then cleared &lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20Airlines"&gt;Republic Airlines&lt;/a&gt; flight 4912, an &lt;a href="w%3AEmbraer%20170"&gt;Embraer 170&lt;/a&gt; departing for &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, to take off from runway 1L, which intersects runway 28R.

After the SkyWest airliner touched down, the &lt;a href="w%3AAirport%20Movement%20Area%20Safety%20System"&gt;Airport Movement Area Safety System&lt;/a&gt; (AMASS) alerted and the air traffic controller transmitted "Hold, Hold, Hold" to the SkyWest flight crew in an attempt to stop the aircraft short of runway 1L. The SkyWest crew applied maximum braking that resulted in the airplane stopping in the middle of runway 1L. As this was occurring, the captain of Republic Airlines flight 4912 took control of the aircraft from the first officer, realized the aircraft was traveling too fast to stop, and initiated an immediate takeoff. According to the crew of SkyWest 5741, the Republic Airlines aircraft overflew theirs by 30 to 50 feet. The Federal Aviation Administration has categorized the incident as an operational error.

The NTSB sent an investigator to San Francisco, who collected &lt;a href="w%3Aradar"&gt;radar&lt;/a&gt; data, recorded air traffic control communications, and flight crew statements, and interviewed air traffic control personnel prior to the NTSB making the preliminary release.

&lt;a href="w%3AEurostar"&gt;Eurostar&lt;/a&gt; train services which link the United Kingdom with Europe via the &lt;a href="w%3AChannel%20Tunnel"&gt;Channel Tunnel&lt;/a&gt; have moved to a new London terminal. The first services from &lt;a href="w%3ASt%20Pancras%20railway%20station"&gt;St Pancras International&lt;/a&gt; launched today following the completion of the &lt;a href="w%3AChannel%20Tunnel%20Rail%20Link"&gt;Channel Tunnel Rail Link&lt;/a&gt; which promises to reduce journey times to &lt;a href="w%3AEurope"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; by 20 minutes.

The Channel Tunnel Rail Link, to be branded as High Speed 1, has been built in two phases; the first section was completed in 2003 and the second section was brought into use today. 

Eurostar chief executive Richard Brown said: "Today marks a new dawn for short-haul travel in Europe. Our move to St Pancras makes Eurostar even more accessible to travellers across Britain. We will carry passengers with greater speed, ease and reliability than ever before, and our travellers will have the extra reassurance of knowing that they are making far less environmental impact compared with flying." 

&lt;a href="w%3AWaterloo%20railway%20station"&gt;Waterloo railway station&lt;/a&gt;, the previous international London terminal, will be returned to domestic use following the move to St Pancras.

&lt;a href="w%3ATeam%20McLaren"&gt;McLaren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMercedes-Benz"&gt;Mercedes&lt;/a&gt; driver &lt;a href="w%3ALewis%20Hamilton"&gt;Lewis Hamilton&lt;/a&gt; won from &lt;a href="w%3Apole%20position"&gt;pole&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFIA"&gt;FIA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFormula-1"&gt;Formula-1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20United%20States%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;United States Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AIndianapolis%20Motor%20Speedway"&gt;Indianapolis Motor Speedway&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AIndianapolis%2C%20Indiana"&gt;Indianapolis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIndiana"&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUSA"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt;. This became his second successive win since the start of the season and in his driver's career with seven consecutive podium finishes.

&lt;a href="w%3AFernando%20Alonso"&gt;Fernando Alonso&lt;/a&gt;, his teammate, showed best results during free practice sessions and two qualifying sessions, but made a crucial mistake in the third, which lead Hamilton to his second pole. Alonso pushed hard on his teammate and once tried to overtake him using slipstream effect on the banking, but the young Briton driver was on the better trajectory and saved the lead.

Both &lt;a href="w%3AScuderia%20Ferrari"&gt;Ferrari&lt;/a&gt; drivers, &lt;a href="w%3AFelipe%20Massa"&gt;Felipe Massa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AKimi%20R%C3%A4ikk%C3%B6nen"&gt;Kimi Räikkönen&lt;/a&gt;, showed third and fourth results in qualification and were able to maintain them to from the starting grid to the end of the race.

&lt;a href="w%3AHeikki%20Kovalainen"&gt;Heikki Kovalainen&lt;/a&gt; driving for &lt;a href="w%3ARenault%20F1"&gt;Renault&lt;/a&gt; successfully ended with his 5th place right ahead of &lt;a href="w%3AJarno%20Trulli"&gt;Jarno Trulli&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AToyota"&gt;Toyota&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Webber"&gt;Mark Webber&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Bull%20Racing"&gt;Red Bull&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3ARenaultF1"&gt;Renault&lt;/a&gt;.

19-year-old German &lt;a href="w%3ASebastian%20Vettel"&gt;Sebastian Vettel&lt;/a&gt;, who replaced &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Kubica"&gt;Robert Kubica&lt;/a&gt; after the Poland driver crash his &lt;a href="w%3ABMW%20Sauber"&gt;BMW&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="Lewis%20Hamilton%20wins%202007%20Canadian%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;previous race&lt;/a&gt;, showed a good results in the qualifying sessions and in the race, closing up top 8 drivers in the same lap as the winner.

Despite of a recent speculations in the media about inequality of the drivers in the McLaren team, Fernando and Lewis, went to the podium hugging one another.

Lewis now leads the drivers' championship with 58 points, 10 ahead of Alonso. Team McLaren leads the constructors' championship with 106 points, 36 ahead of Ferrari.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=EU%20awards%20partial%20victory%20to%20Finland%20over%20wolf%20hunting%20case&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

On June 14 the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Court%20of%20Justice"&gt;European Court of Justice&lt;/a&gt; awarded a partial victory to &lt;a href="w%3AFinland"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt; in a case in which the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Commission"&gt;European Commission&lt;/a&gt; alleged that Finland was issuing licenses to hunt &lt;a href="w%3Awolf"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; in a manner contradictory to rules laid down by the Commission, partly dismissing the commission's case. The case was initially filed in 2005. Crucially, Finland's wolf management plan will not be changed as a result of the decision.

The court said that the commission had not proved that Finland was issuing the licenses in a manner that threatened the survival of the country's wolf population, estimated at around 250, and Finland themselves claim the number of Finnish wolves has recently doubled.

The court ruled that despite two cases where Finland was found to be in the wrong, this did not amount to "constant and general administrative practice amounting to a breach." Finland had issued the licenses on a preventative basis, but EU regulations state that there must be proof of damage or other danger which can only be solved by killing the animal(s) involved, and thus Finland was breaching the &lt;a href="w%3AHabitats%20Directive"&gt;Habitats Directive&lt;/a&gt;.

The court ruled that both sides should pay their own legal costs as both had failed in at least one of their claims.

"The European Court of Justice ratifies the main lines of the wolf population management plan," the Finnish agriculture ministry said. "When planning future wolf policy in Finland, the ministry will take note of the court of justices decision on the wolf and the grounds for it".

However, the ministry also said that it would still issue permits to prevent "very significant loss or damage" providing a survey no more than a year old showed that hunting could actually prevent this loss or damage.

"The crucial point of the decision is that the current system, based on hunting permits granted by the game management districts, is not contrary to the habitats directive," the ministry said in a statement.

"The game management districts can continue to grant permits to hunt wolf within the limits laid down by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry."

The &lt;a href="w%3AArmy%20of%20Islam%20%28Palestine%29"&gt;Army of Islam&lt;/a&gt;, a militant group which claims responsibility for kidnapping &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20News"&gt;BBC News&lt;/a&gt; reporter &lt;a href="w%3AAlan%20Johnston"&gt;Alan Johnston&lt;/a&gt;, has denied that a deal has been reached with &lt;a href="w%3AHamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt; that would secure his release and threaten to kill Johnston if Hamas fails to honor the group's demands, in a video broadcast on &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Jazeera"&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/a&gt;.

Despite the threat, the militant group has said that there are "developments" in the discussions with Hamas, but the group did not say what those developments were.

"There are developments and we will let you know when there are new developments. If they do not meet these demands there will be no release of this prisoner, but if things get worse we will get closer to God by killing this journalist," said an unnamed masked man in the video who is reportedly a spokesman for the Army of Islam. 

In the video, the man says that in order for Johnston to be released, &lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Qatada"&gt;Abu Qatada&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="Palestine"&gt;Palestinian&lt;/a&gt; cleric who is in a &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; prison in the U.K., and all other "Islamic prisoners" must be released from prison.

It is not known if the video is genuine. Johnston was kidnapped while he was returning to his home on March 12 in &lt;a href="w%3AGaza%20City"&gt;Gaza City&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3APolice"&gt;Police&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; are on the hunt for a gunman who killed a man and injured two others in the city's &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20business%20district"&gt;central business district&lt;/a&gt; this morning. 

Officials warned all office workers to remain indoors, and &lt;a href="w%3ARailways%20in%20Melbourne"&gt;train services&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3AFlinders%20Street%20Station"&gt;Flinders Street Station&lt;/a&gt; were temporarily on hold, as investigations were carried out on the intersection of Flinders Lane and William Street.

Malcom Bates, who witnessed the shootings at around 8:15 a.m., said the gunman grabbed a woman from inside a taxi. "The lady got away and he turned and shot three people basically point blank," Mr Bates said. "I was right across the road". He said that the incident took no longer than the "wink of an eye".

Paramedics struggled to revive the one victim for almost an hour before declaring him dead at the scene. The two injured people have been taken to the &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Melbourne%20Hospital"&gt;Royal Melbourne Hospital&lt;/a&gt; in a critical condition.

Police believe the incident began at the Bar Code 24-hour bar in King Street, when a woman attempted to get into a taxi. She was apparently grabbed by the hair by the gunman who then shot her and two men who attempted to come to her aid.

Police have identified the gunman as Christopher Wayne Hudson, aged 29. They believe him to be a member of the &lt;a href="w%3AHells%20Angels"&gt;Hells Angels&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Abikie"&gt;bikie&lt;/a&gt; gang. Police have described Hudson as about 180 &lt;a href="w%3ACentimetre"&gt;cm&lt;/a&gt; tall, with short brown hair and wearing a dark tracksuit top and dark denim jeans.

A building worker on a construction site on the corner of Queen and Flinders Streets has reportedly discovered a handgun. It is understood the gunman may have thrown the weapon into the site as he fled the scene.

Spectators flocked to the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Warplane%20Heritage%20Museum"&gt;Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum&lt;/a&gt;, beside the &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20C.%20Munro%20International%20Airport"&gt;John C. Munro Airport&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AHamilton%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Hamilton, Ontario&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday to see restored Canadian warplanes in the sky as part of the annual ♡❤FlyFest♡❤ &lt;a href="w%3Aairshow"&gt;airshow&lt;/a&gt;.

Included among the day's attractions, was one of two remaining flight-worthy &lt;a href="w%3AAvro%20Lancaster"&gt;Avro Lancaster&lt;/a&gt;s, which was open to visitors to climb into the cockpit for a small fee. Other craft included a &lt;a href="w%3AMesserschmitt%20Bf%20109"&gt;Messerschmitt 109&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AB-25%20Mitchell"&gt;B-25 Mitchell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APBY%20Catalina"&gt;PBY Canso&lt;/a&gt;. 

The non-profit museum is dedicated to restoring old Canadian warplanes from the past 75 years. Normally stored in the museum's display rooms, some of the planes make it out to airshows when finances allow. 

They were flown all day from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. EST.

&lt;a href="Scotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AFirst%20Minister%20of%20Scotland"&gt;First Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Alex%20Salmond"&gt;Alex Salmond&lt;/a&gt; made his first official visit outside Scotland as First Minister, meeting his counterpart in &lt;a href="Northern%20Ireland"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFirst%20Minister%20of%20Northern%20Ireland"&gt;First Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AIan%20Paisley"&gt;Ian Paisley&lt;/a&gt;.

The leader of the &lt;a href="w%3AScottish%20National%20Party"&gt;Scottish National Party&lt;/a&gt;, who is calling for Scotland and Northern Ireland to present a united approach toward governance, addressed the &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Ireland%20Assembly"&gt;Northern Ireland Assembly&lt;/a&gt; and said &lt;a href="w%3AParliament%20Buildings%20%28Northern%20Ireland%29"&gt;Stormont&lt;/a&gt;, and the Scottish Parliament "now share a political model based on necessary compromise."

"The Deputy First Minister hasn't stopped being a nationalist and you, First Minister, haven't stopped being a unionist," Salmond said, referring to &lt;a href="w%3ADeputy%20First%20Minister%20of%20Northern%20Ireland"&gt;Deputy First Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20McGuinness"&gt;Martin McGuinness&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ASinn%20F%C3%A9in"&gt;Sinn Féin&lt;/a&gt; and Paisley, of the &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Unionist%20Party"&gt;Democratic Unionist Party&lt;/a&gt;. "Nevertheless, what matters is identifying the areas where you agree and working on those. It doesn't remove the other issues, but it allows a democratic chamber to function and an executive to govern. 

"No-one in this chamber should feel that their aspirations, their view of the future, is anything other than legitimate," Salmond said in his speech, quoted by &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20News%20Online"&gt;BBC News Online&lt;/a&gt;.
Salmond hailed the dedication of Prime Minister &lt;a href="Tony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; and the resolution of the Northern Ireland political crises.

"You will know how closely many in Scotland follow events and I am acutely aware of the difficulties you faced and, indeed, still face in the path to progress," he said in the Stormont Senate chamber.

"In that context, the efforts to make strides forward in the interests of the people of Northern Ireland are truly remarkable.

"Scottish Government and the people of Scotland salute you for that collective leadership.

"Leadership is a concept that is often cheapened and devalued in modern politics but the members of this Assembly have done something truly impressive.

"Over the last years, you have turned a seemingly intractable situation into one full of hope and optimism. That is real leadership."

Salmond, as a Scottish Nationalist, said he is a passionate believer in Scottish independence, but compromise is still needed. 

Salmond said that he thinks the &lt;a href="w%3AEdinburgh"&gt;Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt; Parliament and the &lt;a href="w%3ABelfast"&gt;Belfast&lt;/a&gt; Assembly present a united front on &lt;a href="w%3ADevolution"&gt;devolution&lt;/a&gt; issues as they seek more home rule powers.

Among the issues would be lowering corporation tax to a 12.5 percent rate.

“It is not a question of ganging up, it is a question of formulating ideas in a constructive way,” Salmond said. “And on many of these issues it will also be, in my opinion, in the interests of the &lt;a href="w%3AParliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom"&gt;Westminster Government&lt;/a&gt;."

He said the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish-Irish%20Council"&gt;British-Irish Council&lt;/a&gt;, meeting next month in Belfast, is "the best mechanism we currently have for Scotland and Northern Ireland to work together within the devolved structure". 

Salmond is also planning to visit &lt;a href="Wales"&gt;Welsh&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href="w%3ARhodri%20Morgan"&gt;Rhodri Morgan&lt;/a&gt; in addition to visits to &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABrussels"&gt;Brussels&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Norway"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt;.

A park in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; state of &lt;a href="Wisconsin"&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt; has been closed, due to being over-run by &lt;a href="w%3Agypsy%20moth"&gt;gypsy moth&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACaterpillar"&gt;caterpillars&lt;/a&gt;.

The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) announced the unprecedented move yesterday, with officials saying they would temporarily close Rocky Arbor State Park near &lt;a href="w%3AWisconsin%20Dells%2C%20Wisconsin"&gt;Wisconsin Dells&lt;/a&gt; due to an infestation of gypsy moth larvae.

The larvae are present at the park in such large numbers that, according to a report by the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWisconsin%20State%20Journal"&gt;Wisconsin State Journal&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, camping there would "apparently be a squishy, nightmarish experience."

Mark Guthmiller, DNR gypsy moth suppression coordinator said that "there are also health and safety considerations that prompted our action," explaining that there was a significant risk of people having severe &lt;a href="w%3Aallergy"&gt;allergic&lt;/a&gt; reactions to the caterpillars. There were also concerns that the caterpillars might be accidentally transported out of the park on park user's vehicles to areas where the moths have as yet failed to establish themselves. Guthmiller also commented that related sanitation issues" would also "significantly detract from the quality park camping experience."

Andrea Diss-Torrance, another gypsy moth coordinator for the DNR, said of the infestation: "It's very severe - it's as severe as I have ever seen."

The closure, which will run until at least June 27, is thought to affect around 95 campground reservations at the site, which covers 255 &lt;a href="w%3Aacre"&gt;acre&lt;/a&gt;s. State officials have been attempting to arrange alternatives for campers at nearby parks, or, failing this being acceptable, are offering refunds. The park will be closed until after the caterpillars have completed pupation - the period in their life cycle in which they transform into moths.

The gypsy moth is a pest in the U.S., having been introduced in the 19th-century in a failed attempt to to try to breed a hardy variant of &lt;a href="w%3Asilkworm"&gt;silkworm&lt;/a&gt;. The moths can strip the leaves off at least 250 different tree species, and as they lack natural predators in the U.S., cause significant damage. The moths often chew leaves but don't actually eat them, thus increasing the potential damage.

At Rocky Arbor, they have already stripped all the trees in some areas of the park. The caterpillars can kill trees directly, but more usually weaken them so that they are more susceptible to die from other causes, such as disease.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Recall%20of%20Thomas%20the%20Tank%20Engine%20toys%20due%20to%20lead-paint%20fears&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A recall issued last week for &lt;a href="w%3AThomas%20the%20Tank%20Engine"&gt;Thomas the Tank Engine&lt;/a&gt; toys made in &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; and containing &lt;a href="w%3ALead%20paint"&gt;lead-based paint&lt;/a&gt;, is the latest scare for consumers, and follows recent scandals involving Chinese-made pet food, pharmaceuticals, toothpaste and other toys, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20New%20York%20Times"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ has reported in a series of articles.

Last week, RC2, a &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; toy company based in &lt;a href="w%3AOak%20Brook%2C%20Illinois"&gt;Oak Brook, Illinois&lt;/a&gt;, issued a recall for its popular wooden "&lt;a href="w%3AThomas%20the%20Tank%20Engine%20and%20Friends"&gt;Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends&lt;/a&gt;" train sets. The recall involved 1.5 million "Thomas Wooden Railway" vehicles and train sets sold at toy stores and various retailers across the U.S. from January 2005 through June 2007.

A subsequent recall has been issued in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, where Thomas the Tank Engine was originated in the 1940s as a character in a children's story by the Reverend &lt;a href="w%3AW.V.%20Awdry"&gt;W.V. Awdry&lt;/a&gt;. Around 70,000 toys are involved in the U.K. recall, according to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Guardian"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

"RC2 has determined that the surface paints on the recalled products contain lead. Lead is toxic if ingested by young children and can cause adverse health effects," the &lt;a href="w%3AConsumer%20Product%20Safety%20Commission"&gt;Consumer Product Safety Commission&lt;/a&gt; said in a press release dated June 13. "Consumers should take the recalled toys away from young children immediately and contact RC2 Corp. for a replacement toy," the commission said.

Those "adverse health effects" could include brain and nerve damage, especially in young children, as well as blood and brain disorders. Severe lead poisoning causes vomiting, diarrhea, convulsions, anemia, loss of appetite, headaches and in particularly high doses, coma and death.

In an article on Monday, ♡❤The New York Times♡❤ reported that recalls have been issued for 24 different toys in the U.S. in the past year, and every one of them was made in China. According to the Toy Industry Association, toys made in China account for around 70 percent to 80 percent of all the toys sold in the U.S., ♡❤The Times♡❤ said.

"These are items that children are supposed to be playing with," Prescott Carlson was quoted as saying by ♡❤The Times♡❤. Carlson is a co-founder of a child-safety website called Imperfect Parent, which tracks recalls of toys and other baby products. "It should be at a point where companies in the United States that are importing these items are held liable," Carlson said.

RC2 would not comment to ♡❤The Times♡❤, and a Consumer Product Safety Commission spokesman would not say how long ago the problem with the lead paint was discovered.

For a follow-up article on Tuesday, ♡❤The Times♡❤ visited a factory in &lt;a href="w%3ADongguan"&gt;Dongguan&lt;/a&gt;, in China's &lt;a href="w%3AGuangdong"&gt;Guangdong province&lt;/a&gt;, where the "Thomas and Friends" toys are made. The paper interviewed workers and took photos on the factory floor.

"You're intruding," a factory manager identified only as Zhong was quoted as telling the reporters. "Tell me, why exactly are you here?"

During the visit, a reporter, translator and a photographer were detained by factory officials, and released a day later after local police and government officials intervened.

The factory also produces other toys for RC2, including toy &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Deere"&gt;John Deere&lt;/a&gt; trucks, &lt;a href="w%3ANASCAR"&gt;NASCAR&lt;/a&gt; racing models and &lt;a href="w%3AM%26amp%3BM%27s"&gt;M&amp;M's&lt;/a&gt; cars, ♡❤The Times♡❤ said. RC2 makes the toys under licenses from various companies. The "Thomas and Friends" toys are made under license from Hit Entertainment, which owns the "Thomas" brand.

A study published on June 18 in the American &lt;a href="w%3AProceedings%20of%20the%20National%20Academy%20of%20Sciences"&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt; has found a link between the consumption of &lt;a href="w%3Afoie%20gras"&gt;foie gras&lt;/a&gt; and other meat products and a number of diseases, including &lt;a href="w%3AAlzheimer%27s%20disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Arheumatoid%20arthritis"&gt;rheumatoid arthritis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Adiabetes%20mellitus%20type%202"&gt;diabetes mellitus type 2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Atuberculosis"&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3Aamyloidosis"&gt;amyloidosis&lt;/a&gt;. The link exists in genetically susceptible individuals. 
The study was lead by Alan Solomon, M.D., a professor and researcher at the University of Tennessee Graduate School of Medicine and the director of the Human Immunology and Cancer / Alzheimer's Disease and Amyloid-Related Disorders Research Program. Amyloidoses are a group of disease states caused by the deposition in vital organs of proteins in the form of fibrils, causing a range of symptoms such as swelling and kidney damage. The deposition of &lt;a href="w%3AAmyloid%20beta"&gt;amyloid beta&lt;/a&gt; in the brain is central in the origin of the disease process of Alzheimer's disease. Foie gras is made from the livers of ducks or geese that have been &lt;a href="w%3AFoie%20gras%20controversy"&gt;force-fed&lt;/a&gt;.

According to Solomon, "we posit that this and perhaps other forms of amyloidosis may be transmissible, akin to the infectious nature of &lt;a href="w%3Aprion"&gt;prion&lt;/a&gt;-related illnesses [such as &lt;a href="w%3ABovine%20spongiform%20encephalopathy"&gt;mad cow disease&lt;/a&gt;]. In addition to foie gras, meat derived from sheep and seemingly healthy cattle may represent other dietary sources of [the fibrils]. People with a family history of Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis or other amyloid-associated diseases should avoid consuming foie gras and other foods that may be contaminated with fibrils," continued Solomon.

The identities of three &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; soldiers killed Wednesday in a roadside bomb blast in southern &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; have been released by the &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20National%20Defence%20and%20the%20Canadian%20Forces"&gt;Department of National Defence&lt;/a&gt; (DND). The three soldiers were killed at approximately 7:49 a.m. local time, when their unarmoured all-terrain vehicle received the force of a nearby bomb blast. 

The identities of the three soldiers were reported as follows:

<ul>
BULLET::::- Corporal Stephen Frederick Bouzane, age 26, 3rd Battalion &lt;a href="w%3APrincess%20Patricia%27s%20Canadian%20Light%20Infantry"&gt;Princess Patricia’s Canadian Light Infantry&lt;/a&gt;;
BULLET::::- Private Joel Vincent Wiebe, age 22, 3rd Battalion Princess Patricia’s Canadian Light Infantry; and
BULLET::::- Sergeant Christos Karigiannis, (age not provided), 3rd Battalion Princess Patricia’s Canadian Light Infantry

</ul>
At the request of the family, Sergeant Christos Karigiannis' identity had been held back by DND.

The latest deaths brought the total number of Canadian soldiers killed in the Afghan mission, which began in 2002, to 60.

Canadian Brigadier-General Tim Grant commented on the fact that the incident took place in a secure zone in the &lt;a href="w%3APanjwaye%20District"&gt;Panjwaye District&lt;/a&gt;, about 40 kilometres (25 miles) west of &lt;a href="w%3AKandahar"&gt;Kandahar&lt;/a&gt;, and approximately 6 km west of Forward Operating Base Sperwan-Gar. "A determined enemy clearly was able to penetrate the defences and the observation in the area to plant the device," said Grant. The soldiers had been carrying out a routine operation, which involved transporting supplies between two checkpoints. 

Grant described the unarmoured soldier's vehicle as "appropriate for the task at hand." He did concede, however, that changes may have to be made to the protocol. "We will review our procedures and if we determine that we need to change them, then we will do so," said Grant.

Corporal Bouzane's father, Fred Bouzane, said that his son will be buried in the town of his birth, &lt;a href="w%3ALittle%20Bay%2C%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador"&gt;Little Bay&lt;/a&gt;, in the province of &lt;a href="w%3ANewfoundland%20and%20Labrador"&gt;Newfoundland and Labrador&lt;/a&gt;. "Stephen's smile and dry sense of humour touched everyone he met. He was a quiet, kind and dedicated man who loved his chosen profession and was excited to be in Afghanistan helping the Afghan people," the family said in a statement.

The gunman involved in the &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; shooting on Monday has missed court because of a reported injury in his arm and needed surgery in the St Vincent's Hospital. He is under police guard and was remanded in custody until October 10. 31 year-old Christopher Wayne Hudson handed himself in to the police peacefully late yesterday afternoon. 

On Monday morning one person, Brendan Keilar, was killed and two wounded in the shooting and much of the centre of Melbourne was sealed off as police searched for the gunman. 

Police would not discuss how Hudson received the injury but said the injury happened before his arrest. His lawyer, Patrick Dwyer, also refused to comment on the speculation that it was self-inflicted.

Irish president &lt;a href="w%3AMary%20McAleese"&gt;Mary McAleese&lt;/a&gt; wrapped up a two-day visit to &lt;a href="w%3AToronto"&gt;Toronto, Canada&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday by cutting the ribbon at the opening of a new park. The city's &lt;a href="w%3AIreland%20Park"&gt;Ireland Park&lt;/a&gt; is dedicated to the Irish immigrants who fled the &lt;a href="w%3AGreat%20Irish%20Famine"&gt;great famine&lt;/a&gt; to start a new life in Canada 160 years ago.

More than 1,200 people were present to watch McAleese disembark the Irish naval flagship ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AL%C3%89%20Eithne%20%28P31%29"&gt;L.E. Eithne&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ to enter the park, after earlier having laid flowers at the St. James Cemetery which holds the remains of 281 immigrants.

Accompanied by 45 dignitaries, security and naval officers, McAleese then walked around the perimeter of the park, admiring the monuments and pausing to enjoy the live music. 

McAleese then cut the scarlet ribbon, opening the park to those gathered - including the likes of Toronto mayor &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Miller"&gt;David Miller&lt;/a&gt;, Ontario premier &lt;a href="w%3ADalton%20McGuinty"&gt;Dalton McGuinty&lt;/a&gt;, Irish ambassador &lt;a href="w%3ADeclan%20Kelly"&gt;Declan Kelly&lt;/a&gt; and federal Finance Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Flaherty"&gt;Jim Flaherty&lt;/a&gt;. 

After the ceremony, the presidential entourage moved to the nearby stage to speak with the crowd, following the rendition of both the Canadian and Irish national anthems.

Following her thanks to Canadians on Wednesday for helping to promote &lt;a href="w%3ACeltic%20Tiger"&gt;Ireland's economic improvements&lt;/a&gt; over the past fifteen years, McAleese also thanked the country for being "a place of welcome for people around the world", noting that "the amazing Toronto welcome hasn't changed in 160 years".

But the speech was not simply about past history, as McAleese drew a parallel between modern refugees and those fleeing Ireland's famine in the mid-19 century, speaking of a "moral obligation to those around the world who continue to starve".

The speech left an impression on the crowd, including 4-generation Irishman Arn Bailey. "It was really rather impressive", explained Bailey - rueing the fact that he was unable to decipher the opening &lt;a href="w%3AGailge"&gt;Gailge&lt;/a&gt; phrase that McAleese spoke to the gathering.
Mayor David Miller also took his turn at public speaking, reminding those gathered that "we are all immigrants to this place, and that is what makes us Torontonians"

The brainchild of brothers Robert and Jonathan Kearns, the park was built at a cost of $3.5 million dollars over the past seven years. The governments of both Canada and Ireland pledged matching $500,000 donations to help allay the cost, with the rest coming from donors and fundraisings.

"The Irish community of Toronto came forward with unprecedented generosity", explained park founder Robert Kearns, blessing their ancestors for having "stamped into the mold of this nation, the hallmark of...determination".

The park's main feature, a towering monument bearing the names of hundreds of immigrants who died on Toronto's wharves, is made of irregular &lt;a href="w%3Alimestone"&gt;limestone&lt;/a&gt; shipped from a 200-year old quarry in &lt;a href="w%3AKilkenny%2C%20Ireland"&gt;Kilkenny, Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. Interactive outdoor computer terminals rest in the shadow of an illuminated glass tower, which will remain lit at night as a beacon.

The eastern edge of the 300'x70' park is bordered by five bronze statues of destitute refugees, created by Irish sculptor &lt;a href="w%3ARowan%20Gillespie"&gt;Rowan Gillespie&lt;/a&gt; in Dublin, and shipped to Toronto in February at a total cost of $325,000. The statues were made to complement a set of seven similar statues built on the coast of Ireland in 1997, to symbolise the emigrants ♡❤leaving♡❤ the island.

Approximately 38,000 Irish refugees landed in Toronto after their stay at &lt;a href="w%3AGrosse%20Isle%2C%20Quebec"&gt;Grosse Ile&lt;/a&gt;, more than doubling the city's population in a mere six months. While more than 1,100 died shortly after arriving in the city, McAleeese noted that at least they "had the comfort of knowing that they died [in Toronto], among love".

Today, there are nearly four million Irish-Canadians, a population rivaling that of the Emerald Isle itself.

The park is located along the &lt;a href="w%3AToronto%20Harbour"&gt;Toronto Harbourfront&lt;/a&gt;, on a section of road renamed ♡❤Éireann Quay♡❤ in honour of the park in a ceremony last month.

The planned landing of &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Atlantis"&gt;Space Shuttle ♡❤Atlantis♡❤&lt;/a&gt; earlier today has been postponed due to poor weather conditions in the vicinity of the landing strip at the &lt;a href="w%3AKennedy%20Space%20Center"&gt;Kennedy Space Center&lt;/a&gt;. The shuttle is currently on &lt;a href="w%3ASTS-117"&gt;STS-117&lt;/a&gt;, a mission to the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Space%20Station"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt;.

According to &lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;, there were showers within a 34-mile radius of the landing strip and clouds within 8,000 feet. Both of these represent conditions in which flight rules prohibit a landing. The shuttle has five more opportunities to land over the course of the next three days. ♡❤Atlantis♡❤ could land tomorrow at 2:16 p.m. or 3:51 p.m. ET. According to Mission Control, weather forecasts predict better conditions tomorrow.

If necessary, there are also backup sites in &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="New%20Mexico"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. If required, these alternative facilities will be activated on Saturday. ♡❤Atlantis♡❤ can potentially remain in orbit until Sunday, but officials have stated they will only postpone landing until Sunday if there are technical problems that require attention prior to landing.

NASA would prefer not to use alternative sites as this would significantly increase the cost of preparing ♡❤Atlantis♡❤ for its next mission, scheduled for December. The shuttle would have to be brought back on a jumbo jet; this would take up to ten days and cost US$1.7 million.

The mission managers held a last-minute meeting late Wednesday to discuss potential problems which could affect the landing – damage to the thermal blanket on takeoff - which required repairs. Material known as gap filler was found to be sticking out of a wing, and debris was found floating nearby after the shuttle docked with the space station on Tuesday. The only problem found to be of significant concern was the gap filler. Engineers want to check whether gap filler will withstand the re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere.

<h2>Roadside bomb kills three Canadian soldiers in Panjwaye, Afghanistan</h2>

The identities of three Canadian soldiers killed Wednesday in a roadside bomb blast in southern Afghanistan have been released by the Department of National Defence (DND). The three soldiers were killed at approximately 7:49 a.m. local time, when their unarmoured all-terrain vehicle received the force of a nearby bomb blast.

The identities of the three soldiers were reported as follows:

At the request of the family, Sergeant Christos Karigiannis' identity had been held back by DND.

The latest deaths brought the total number of Canadian soldiers killed in the Afghan mission, which began in 2002, to 60.

<h2>Recall of Thomas the Tank Engine toys due to lead-paint fears</h2>
A recall issued last week for Thomas the Tank Engine toys made in China and containing lead-based paint, is the latest scare for consumers, and follows recent scandals involving Chinese-made pet food, pharmaceuticals, toothpaste and other toys, The New York Times has reported in a series of articles.

Last week, RC2, a U.S. toy company based in Oak Brook, Illinois, issued a recall for its popular wooden "Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends" train sets. The recall involved 1.5 million "Thomas Wooden Railway" vehicles and train sets sold at toy stores and various retailers across the U.S. from January 2005 through June 2007.

A subsequent recall has been issued in the United Kingdom, where Thomas the Tank Engine was originated in the 1940s as a character in a children's story by the Reverend W.V. Awdry. Around 70,000 toys are involved in the U.K. recall, according to The Guardian.

"RC2 has determined that the surface paints on the recalled products contain lead. Lead is toxic if ingested by young children and can cause adverse health effects," the Consumer Product Safety Commission said in a press release dated June 13. "Consumers should take the recalled toys away from young children immediately and contact RC2 Corp. for a replacement toy," the commission said.

Those "adverse health effects" could include brain and nerve damage, especially in young children, as well as blood and brain disorders. Severe lead poisoning causes vomiting, diarrhea, convulsions, anemia, loss of appetite, headaches and in particularly high doses, coma and death.

<h2>Thai scientist has deodorized the stinky 'king of fruits'</h2>
In southeast Asia, durian is known as the "king of fruits," but with its pungent odor, the large, spike-husked fruit receives less-than-royal treatment in many quarters.

A Thai scientist thinks he has found the key to more widespread acceptance of durian, by creating odorless varieties of the fruit. After 20 years of cross-breeding, researcher Songpol Somsri has come up with a durian "that smells as inoffensive as a banana," according to an article today by The Guardian.

"I've got friends from Australia, Europe and Japan who just won't eat durian because they can't stand the smell," Songpol was quoted as saying. "But I'm sure producing those with a mild smell will help us find new markets."

Despite their popularity, the fruits are banned from the subway system in Singapore. In Bangkok, taxi drivers will often balk at a passenger with durian. The region's airlines won't allow them to be brought onboard. Across southeast Asia, a sign that denotes a finer hotel is a placard in the lobby with a red circle and cross through a silhouette of a durian.

Cultivated across all of southeast Asia, the fruit measures about 12 inches (30 centimeters) long and 6 inches (15 centimeters) in diameter, and weighs around 2 to 7 pounds (1 to 3 kilograms). The fruits are green on the outside, and covered with a thick, spike-covered husk. In Malay, the name durian literally means "thorny fruit".

&lt;a href="North%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt; has agreed to speed up the shut down of their nuclear facilities, following a surprise visit from U.S. diplomat &lt;a href="w%3AChristopher%20R.%20Hill"&gt;Christopher Hill&lt;/a&gt;. The meetings, between himself and North Korean foreign minister Pak Ui Chun, were described by Hill as "very good discussion[s]" and, "very detailed, very substantive, and I believe they were also very useful." Another big success attributed to Hill is the North Korean agreement to shut down every single one of their atomic programs. "We discussed all aspects of &lt;a href="w%3ASix-party%20talks"&gt;the six-party process&lt;/a&gt;. And all aspects means all aspects," said Hill. 

The &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;-based, pro-North Korean newspaper, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AChoson%20Sinbo"&gt;Chosun Sinbo&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, stated "On the ocassion of Assistant Secretary of State Hill's visit to the DPRK, the progress in DPRK-U.S. relations and implementating the six-party talks agreements will be accelerated," adding, "The DPRK does not wish to stand still, and it has no reason to delay the implementation of the (nuclear) agreement," DPRK stands for Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the official name of North Korea.

Hill, ending his trip right on schedule, flies to &lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt; and then to &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; to debrief his counterparts in their respective countries. Hill made this remark about the future: "So away from this two-day set of meetings, I sense that we are going to be able to achieve our full objectives – that is, complete denuclearization."

We, a &lt;a href="w%3APolycephaly"&gt;two-headed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAlbinism"&gt;albino&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AHermaphrodite"&gt;hermaphrodite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Arat%20snake"&gt;rat snake&lt;/a&gt; that was featured on national television in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and attracted a sponsorship deal from a pharmaceutical company, died of natural causes on Tuesday at &lt;a href="w%3ACity%20Museum"&gt;City Museum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Louis%2C%20Missouri"&gt;St. Louis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Missouri"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt;. It was eight years old.

A major attraction at the City Museum's World Aquarium, We will be preserved by a &lt;a href="w%3ATaxidermy"&gt;taxidermist&lt;/a&gt; and put back on display, according to an article yesterday in the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Louis%20Post-Dispatch"&gt;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

Museum officials said We was incredibly long-lived for a two-headed snake. Often in two-headed animals, one mouth is not connected to the stomach, and because of complications, the animals will die within a month of being born. But We was fortunate, in that both its mouths were connected to its stomach.

"A snake like that in the wild would not survive," curator Chris Hancock was quoted as saying by the ♡❤Post-Dispatch♡❤. "But the fact that it lived that long and we were able to afford it and educate people about it is awesome."

Aquarium president Leonard Sonnenschein bought We in 1999 for US$15,000 from a snake breeder in &lt;a href="Indiana"&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt;.

"It's terrible news," Sonnenschein was quoted as saying by the &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;. "People come in every day and say: 'I'm here to see the two-headed snake'."

About the size of a pencil when it was acquired, We was about five feet (1.5 meters) long and had a girth of around 1.5 inches (3.8 centimeters) when it died. At times, it appeared that We was straining to slither in two directions at once.

In addition to having two heads, We was also a &lt;a href="w%3AHermaphrodite"&gt;hermaphrodite&lt;/a&gt;. Last year, the museum tried unsuccessfully to breed the two-sexed snake with a two-headed rat snake from &lt;a href="Wisconsin"&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;.

A popular attraction at the museum, an estimated one million people came to see We while it was displayed. We once appeared on "&lt;a href="w%3ALive%20with%20Regis%20and%20Kelly"&gt;Live with Regis and Kelly&lt;/a&gt;", a nationally syndicated television talk show.

In 2004, We was stolen from the museum, but was recovered within hours by police after a call by a tipster, who had seen some teens with a two-headed snake.

We even attracted corporate sponsorship, from a Florida-based biopharmaceutical company, Nutra Pharma, which develops treatments using modified &lt;a href="w%3ACobra"&gt;cobra&lt;/a&gt; venom and cobratoxin. The &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;-based company signed a $15,000 deal in November 2006 to make We its brand icon.

The museum had earlier in 2006 tried to auction We off in a fund-raising effort, hoping to attract bids of up to $100,000, but kept We when the highest bid was half that much.

Last night was the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20MuchMusic%20Video%20Awards"&gt;2007 MuchMusic Video Awards&lt;/a&gt; in Downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

&lt;a href="w%3AMuchMusic"&gt;MuchMusic&lt;/a&gt; is the most watched music channel in Canada, and has been holding the event since 1990. Roughly 6,000 fans line the streets surrounding Much headquarters each year, and 1,200 more score "the wristband" and enjoy a free festival-style show in the parking lot, watching four outdoor performance areas spread out in the downtown location. New this year was a special roof-top stage, on the top of the building. &lt;a href="w%3AFinger%20Eleven"&gt;Finger Eleven&lt;/a&gt; performed on this stage, way above the crowds.

Other performers at the show were &lt;a href="w%3AAvril%20Lavigne"&gt;Avril Lavigne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFergie%20%28singer%29"&gt;Fergie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABilly%20Talent"&gt;Billy Talent&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHilary%20Duff"&gt;Hilary Duff&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAlexisonfire"&gt;Alexisonfire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMaroon%205"&gt;Maroon 5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABelly%20%28rapper%29"&gt;Belly&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Used"&gt;The Used&lt;/a&gt;.

Presenters included Nickelback, Jay Manuel (♡❤Canada's Next Top Model♡❤, ♡❤America's Next Top Model♡❤), Tara Reid (♡❤American Pie♡❤, this fall's ♡❤Land of Canaan♡❤), Joss Stone, Sum 41, Amber Tamblyn (♡❤Joan of Arcadia♡❤, ♡❤Grudge 2♡❤), Hedley, Chris Bosh (Toronto Raptors), Sean Avery (New York Rangers), George, Sam Roberts, Emilie de Ravin (♡❤LOST♡❤), Marianas Trench, and Kardinal Offishall.

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; amusement park operator &lt;a href="w%3ASix%20Flags"&gt;Six Flags&lt;/a&gt; has shut down nine thrill rides at four parks after a 13-year-old girl's feet were cut off on a tower-drop ride yesterday at &lt;a href="w%3ASix%20Flags%20Kentucky%20Kingdom"&gt;Six Flags Kentucky Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ALouisville%2C%20Kentucky"&gt;Louisville&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="Kentucky"&gt;Kentucky&lt;/a&gt; state officials said a loose cable on a ride called the Superman Tower of Power severed the girl’s feet above the ankles, but they had not determined how the cable broke free, or at what point in the ride the accident happened. The ride lifts passengers 177 feet (54 metres) straight up, then drops them nearly the same distance at speeds reaching 54 mph (86 km/h).

The girl, whose identity has not been released, was taken to a hospital. Details of her condition were not immediately available.

Six Flags spokeswoman Carolyn McLean told ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Courier-Journal"&gt;The Courier-Journal&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that there has never been a major incident on the Tower of Power. Formerly known as the Hellavator, the ride was built in 1995.

In addition to Kentucky Kingdom, rides have been shut down at &lt;a href="w%3ASix%20Flags%20Great%20America"&gt;Six Flags Great America&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AGurnee%2C%20Illinois"&gt;Gurnee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Illinois"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="w%3ASix%20Flags%20St.%20Louis"&gt;Six Flags St. Louis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AEureka%2C%20Missouri"&gt;Eureka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Missouri"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href="w%3ASix%20Flags%20America"&gt;Six Flags America&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APrince%20George%27s%20County%2C%20Maryland"&gt;Prince George's County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Maryland"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt;.

A Superman Tower of Power Ride at &lt;a href="w%3ASix%20Flags%20Over%20Texas"&gt;Six Flags Over Texas&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AArlington%2C%20Texas"&gt;Arlington&lt;/a&gt; has not been shut down because it is not the same as the ones in Kentucky and the other locations that have been shut, Six Flags spokeswoman Wendy Goldberg told the &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;.

The rides that have been shut down are made by a &lt;a href="Switzerland"&gt;Swiss&lt;/a&gt;-owned company called Intamin.

&lt;a href="w%3ACedar%20Fair%20Entertainment%20Company"&gt;Cedar Fair Entertainment Company&lt;/a&gt; said it was shutting down similar thrill rides at its theme parks at &lt;a href="w%3AKings%20Island"&gt;Kings Island&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AMason%2C%20Ohio"&gt;Mason&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Ohio"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="w%3ACanada%27s%20Wonderland"&gt;Canada's Wonderland&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AVaughan%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Vaughan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Ontario"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="w%3AKings%20Dominion"&gt;Kings Dominion&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ADoswell%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Doswell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Virginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="w%3ACarowinds"&gt;Carowinds&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ACharlotte%2C%20North%20Carolina"&gt;Charlotte&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="North%20Carolina"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href="w%3AGreat%20America%20%28California%29"&gt;Great America&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASanta%20Clara%2C%20California"&gt;Santa Clara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20men%27s%20national%20soccer%20team"&gt;United States men's soccer team&lt;/a&gt; have won the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20CONCACAF%20Gold%20Cup"&gt;2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup&lt;/a&gt; by defeating &lt;a href="w%3AMexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; 2-1 at &lt;a href="w%3ASoldier%20Field"&gt;Soldier Field&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AChicago"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;.

Mexico took the lead shortly before halftime with a goal from &lt;a href="w%3AJose%20Andres%20Guardado"&gt;Jose Andres Guardado&lt;/a&gt;.

The Unites States leveled the scores when &lt;a href="w%3ALandon%20Donovan"&gt;Landon Donovan&lt;/a&gt; converted a penalty in the 62nd minute and took the lead 11 minutes later from a goal by &lt;a href="w%3ABenny%20Feilhaber"&gt;Benny Feilhaber&lt;/a&gt;.

Feilhaber's goal was only his second international goal. Donovan's 34th international goal ties him for first place with &lt;a href="w%3AEric%20Wynalda"&gt;Eric Wynalda&lt;/a&gt; among all-time &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20men%27s%20national%20soccer%20team"&gt;US men's nationals&lt;/a&gt;. The United States were the defending champions and hosts for the twelve-team biennial event.

&lt;a href="w%3ATeam%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Team New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; have defeated Swiss syndicate &lt;a href="w%3AAlinghi"&gt;Alinghi&lt;/a&gt; in the second race of the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20America%27s%20Cup"&gt;32nd America's Cup&lt;/a&gt; Challenge on Sunday, making the overall score equal with one win for each team.

Team New Zealand, racing with &lt;a href="w%3ANZL-92"&gt;NZL-92&lt;/a&gt;, crossed the start line three seconds ahead of Alinghi's yacht, &lt;a href="w%3ASUI-100"&gt;SUI-100&lt;/a&gt;. But Alinghi led the race at the first mark by 13 seconds, though near the ending of the race, Team New Zealand managed to overtake Alinghi to lead the final leg of the race by 28 seconds.

Former Alinghi and Team New Zealand skipper, Russell Coutts said that the latest win for Team New Zealand will act as a big boost for them. Ray Davis, Team New Zealand after-guard, said, "It’s been huge for the team to get a win on the board in the America’s Cup. It has been a long time coming for Emirates Team New Zealand."

Dan Cowie, Team New Zealand trimmer, said, "As we said yesterday there are two very even boats out there. We didn’t learn a whole lot more today."

The next race is scheduled for tomorrow, Monday being a race-off day.

The last time Alinghi and Team New Zealand fought for the America's Cup was when Team New Zealand was defending the trophy in Auckland, New Zealand.

The past three consecutive America's Cup challenges have been all whitewash victories, and five of the last six challenges have also been whitewashes.

Zoila Meyer, a 40-year-old mother of two sons in &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Bernadino%2C%20California"&gt;San Bernadino, California&lt;/a&gt;, is facing deportation from the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; for illegally voting in the 2004 general election. Although she was a legal resident at the time, she was not a citizen and voting is therefore illegal. 

Meyer, who was brought from &lt;a href="Cuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt; to the US as a one-year-old child, says she believed she was a true American citizen all her life. 

Meyer said, "I've been voting since I was 18. I didn't know I was here illegally. It was a mistake on my parents' behalf. They messed up. They didn't want to. It just 
happened."

"This whole process is not my fault. They ask, 'How can you not know you're not a citizen?' But if you're parents don't tell you this, you don't know. It's like kids who don't find out until they're adults that they were adopted. We believe what we are told." 

Lori Haley, a spokesperson for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said: "She can plead her case before an immigration judge, if she feels that she has reason to seek release for removal. ...Everybody has due process when they're arrested."

Earlier in 2004, Meyer won the election to City Council of the town of &lt;a href="w%3AAdelanto%2C%20California"&gt;Adelanto, California&lt;/a&gt;, which has a population of about 23,000 people. Following this, police were tipped off that Meyer was born in Cuba, not in the US, leading to an investigation. The police later arrived and informed Meyer of her legal residency, but lack of US citizenship. After acknowledging this, she applied for citizenship. 
She voted in the 2004 election, without having been granted citizenship. She was charged with fraudulent voting, a misdemeanor and a deportable offense. 
So, on June 18, officials arrived at her home and told her to go to their office in San Bernadino. After being driven to the office by her husband a few days later, she was handcuffed, frisked, processed, and put in jail. 

Zoila also commented on her case, saying that "I see people writing 'this is my country.' It really isn't. It belongs to the government and they decide who stays 
and who goes...you think you're free; you're really not."

Kidnapped &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israeli&lt;/a&gt; soldier &lt;a href="w%3AGilad%20Shalit"&gt;Cpl. Gilad Shalit&lt;/a&gt;, 20, is believed to be alive, and &lt;a href="w%3AHamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt; has released an audio tape in which Shalit says he needs to be hospitalized and that he regrets that Israel has not met the demands of the kidnappers.

"I have been in prison for an entire year and my health is deteriorating. I need lengthy hospitalisation. I regret the lack of interest of the Israeli government and military in my case and their failure to meet the demands. Just as I have parents, a mother and father, thousands of &lt;a href="Palestine"&gt;Palestinian&lt;/a&gt; detainees have mothers and fathers whose sons must be returned to them. I have a great hope from my government that it show more interest in me and meet the demands of the &lt;a href="w%3AMujahideen"&gt;Mujahideen&lt;/a&gt; (kidnappers)," said Shalit on the audio tape.

Noam Shalit, Gilad's father says that he is "almost sure" that the voice on the tape is that of his son, but also states that "we cannot know when it was recorded. I imagine that it's the same as the letter they dictated to him and doesn't reflect his real state. We want somebody independent to see him, to examine him and the conditions under which he is held, his medical condition of course and his mental (condition)."

Israeli officials believe that the kidnappers told Shalit what to say during the audio recording and that the Israeli government will not cooperate with the group.

"How cruel can Hamas be? We will not cooperate with Hamas. We will not compromise with Hamas," said Miri Eisin, a spokeswoman for Israeli Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AEhud%20Olmert"&gt;Ehud Olmert&lt;/a&gt;.

Hamas states that Israel had every chance to swap prisoners to release Shalit, but that Israel has to act.

"We have been flexible in every possible way when it came to a swap deal, but the Israeli side was too weak to make a decision. The ball is now in the Israeli court," said Osama al-Muzaini, a senior official for Hamas.

Shalit was kidnapped exactly one year ago today on June 25, 2006. He was kidnapped in &lt;a href="w%3AGaza%20City"&gt;Gaza City&lt;/a&gt; which sparked a month long war between &lt;a href="Lebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; and Israel.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Last%20of%20raisers%20of%20first%20U.S.%20flag%20over%20Iwo%20Jima%20dies&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The last surviving Marine of those who raised the &lt;a href="w%3ARaising%20the%20Flag%20on%20Iwo%20Jima"&gt;first U.S. flag over Iwo Jima&lt;/a&gt; during World War II, &lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20W.%20Lindberg"&gt;Charles "Chuck" Lindberg&lt;/a&gt;, passed away at the Fairview Southdale Hospital in &lt;a href="w%3AMinneapolis%2C%20Minnesota"&gt;Minneapolis, Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday.
Lindberg attended two memorial dedications in recent weeks, and was himself honored at the unveiling of the &lt;a href="Minnesota%20World%20War%20II%20Memorial%20dedicated"&gt;Minnesota World War II Memorial&lt;/a&gt; at the State Capitol on June 9. Earlier this month on &lt;a href="w%3AMemorial%20Day"&gt;Memorial Day&lt;/a&gt;, Lindberg was in attendance at the 'Honoring All Veterans Memorial' in the town of &lt;a href="w%3ARichfield%2C%20Minnesota"&gt;Richfield&lt;/a&gt;, where he resided since 1951.

Lindberg was hospitalized on June 10, and was aged 86 at his passing. The cause of his death is not presently known.

In his memory, local television station WCCO-TV will air its documentary of his actions, "The Last Flagraiser", over the next two Sundays at 11:00 AM .
Lindberg fought during WWII with the 3rd Platoon, known as Easy Company, in the 28th Regiment of the Marine Corps. After the war, he advocated to set the historical record straight on the group who planted the first flag on top of Iwo Jima, a key island in the Pacific Ocean during the war, which Japan has recently renamed ♡❤Iōtō♡❤.

Awarded the &lt;a href="w%3ASilver%20Star"&gt;Silver Star&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3APurple%20Heart"&gt;Purple Heart&lt;/a&gt; for his military service, Lindberg was among a group of Marines who first reached the summit of the volcanic island's highest point called &lt;a href="w%3AIwo%20Jima"&gt;Mount Suribachi&lt;/a&gt;.

The Pulitzer Prize winning photograph taken by &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Rosenthal"&gt;Joe Rosenthal&lt;/a&gt; pictured at Wikipedia's &lt;a href="w%3ARaising%20the%20Flag%20on%20Iwo%20Jima"&gt;Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima&lt;/a&gt; was presumably taken 4 hours after the U.S. force took control of the island's high point.

A new video has been released by the kidnappers of &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; News reporter &lt;a href="w%3AAlan%20Johnston"&gt;Alan Johnston&lt;/a&gt;, who was kidnapped while returning from work in &lt;a href="w%3AGaza%20City"&gt;Gaza City&lt;/a&gt; 105 days ago.

In the video Johnston is shown wearing what the reporter says is an "explosive belt" around his waist. He continues to say "the kidnappers say [the belt] will be detonated if there is any attempt to storm this area. They say they're ready to turn the hideout into what they describe as a death zone if there is an attempt to free me by force."

Both the BBC and Alan's family were "distressed" by the video and both re-iterated their plea for Alan to be released peacefully. 

Johnston, 45 and from Scotland, was kidnapped in Gaza by a militant group calling itself "The Army of Islam" over 14 weeks ago whilst nearing the end of a three year contract there and is, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, one of 15 journalists abducted from Gaza since 2004. All the others were released, unharmed, within days of their capture.

The &lt;a href="w%3AScottish%20Criminal%20Cases%20Review%20Commission"&gt;Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission&lt;/a&gt; (SCCRC), an organisation that investigates alleged &lt;a href="w%3AMiscarriage%20of%20justice"&gt;miscarriages of justice&lt;/a&gt;, is to complete a review on June 28, 2007 of the conviction on January 31, 2001 of &lt;a href="Libya"&gt;Libya&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href="w%3AAbdel%20Basset%20Ali%20al-Megrahi"&gt;Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi&lt;/a&gt; for the December 21, 1988 bombing of &lt;a href="w%3APan%20Am%20Flight%20103"&gt;Pan Am Flight 103&lt;/a&gt;. All 259 passengers and crew of the &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20747"&gt;Boeing 747&lt;/a&gt;, and eleven people on the ground, were killed when a &lt;a href="w%3Aimprovised%20explosive%20device"&gt;bomb&lt;/a&gt; destroyed the aircraft over the town of &lt;a href="w%3ALockerbie"&gt;Lockerbie&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Scotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;. Megrahi was convicted on 270 counts of murder, and was sentenced to life imprisonment. It is expected that the &lt;a href="w%3ASCCRC"&gt;SCCRC&lt;/a&gt; will refer &lt;a href="w%3AMegrahi"&gt;Megrahi's&lt;/a&gt; case back to the &lt;a href="w%3ACourt%20of%20Criminal%20Appeal"&gt;court of appeal&lt;/a&gt;. A summary of the Commission's findings will be published, but the main report will not.

Today's ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AScotsman"&gt;Scotsman&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reported that documents leaked from &lt;a href="w%3AMegrahi"&gt;Megrahi&lt;/a&gt;'s legal team include allegations that evidence used to convict him 'was subject to deliberate destruction and manipulation for political reasons'. Officials in both the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; are accused of "a co-ordinated effort to mislead the court" in order to divert attention from other suspects with links to &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="Syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;, whose support was needed at the time of the first &lt;a href="w%3AGulf%20War"&gt;Gulf War&lt;/a&gt;.

During its three-year review, the SCCRC has been shown hundreds of documents and photographs which are alleged to show that evidence was invented, manipulated or ignored by the British police on the one hand and the &lt;a href="w%3ACIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AFBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; on the other. Veteran politician &lt;a href="w%3ATam%20Dalyell"&gt;Tam Dalyell&lt;/a&gt;, who has campaigned against the conviction for years, has now said that the full report by the SCCRC should be made public, adding "The Crown Office has a moral obligation to hold a public inquiry. If it embarrasses the Scottish judiciary, so be it. We're in danger of becoming the laughing stock of Europe." He also said “I have no doubt that evidence was planted, and I have said so repeatedly in the &lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20of%20Commons"&gt;Commons&lt;/a&gt;. Only a full, public and nonadversarial inquiry can finally settle this matter.” Meanwhile, defence lawyers said that if Megrahi is granted an appeal or retrial they will attempt to convince authorities to release him until the case comes to court.

The credibility of several key parts of the prosecution's case is seriously questioned in the evidence submitted to the SCCRC, with rescue workers describing items as intact when they were discovered, but which were presented in fragmentary form at the &lt;a href="w%3APan%20Am%20Flight%20103%20bombing%20trial"&gt;Lockerbie bombing trial&lt;/a&gt;. The evidence of &lt;a href="Malta"&gt;Maltese&lt;/a&gt; shopkeeper &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Gauci"&gt;Tony Gauci&lt;/a&gt; is also challenged. Although Gauci testified that Megrahi bought clothes from him that were later found to have been in the suitcase containing the bomb, in reality he apparently gave a number of inconsistent and substantially different accounts of who bought the clothes, failed to pick out Megrahi at an &lt;a href="w%3Aidentity%20parade"&gt;identity parade&lt;/a&gt;, and even linked the clothes' purchase to convicted Egyptian terrorist &lt;a href="w%3AMohammed%20Abu%20Talb"&gt;Mohammed Abu Talb&lt;/a&gt;, from the Iran-backed &lt;a href="w%3APopular%20Front%20for%20the%20Liberation%20of%20Palestine"&gt;Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine&lt;/a&gt;. Defence lawyers also alleged that two early statements by Gauci are missing altogether.

One investigator also claims that evidence was fabricated, while there was insufficient investigation into claims by a &lt;a href="w%3Abaggage%20handler"&gt;baggage handler&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3AHeathrow%20International%20Airport"&gt;Heathrow International Airport&lt;/a&gt; that the suitcase containing the bomb was only added to the flight at the last minute.

The SCCRC refused to comment, saying: "It is not for Scottish ministers to comment or preempt the outcome of this review." Further it said: "It is the strong view of the Scottish Government that due process of law will be followed and seen to be followed in all matters pertaining to this case." 

The SCCRC will issue it's report on Thursday June 28, 2007.

Heavy rain in &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Wales"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt; has caused the death of one man after he was sucked down a man hole in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKingston%20upon%20Hull"&gt;Hull&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; when attempting to clear flood water. A teenage boy was also killed after being swept away by flood water of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARiver%20Sheaf"&gt;River Sheaf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASheffield"&gt;Sheffield&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASheffield%20flood%20of%202007"&gt;flooding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has inundated large areas of land, many houses and caused travel chaos with many roads and railways flooded or blocked by stranded vehicles, especially in northern England.

75 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMillimetre"&gt;mm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of rain in some areas has caused severe flooding, which could get worse as forecasters predict one month's worth of rain will fall in the next 24 hours.

A &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Astate%20of%20emergency"&gt;state of emergency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has been declared in Hull and over 120 schools have been closed in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AYorkshire"&gt;Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALincolnshire"&gt;Lincolnshire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The fire service, police and coast guards have attempted many rescues today with helicopters used to remove people from stranded houses to temporary shelters.

Areas also affected are along the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARiver%20Severn"&gt;River Severn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARiver%20Teme"&gt;River Teme&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARiver%20Aire"&gt;River Aire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The rain also affected the start of &lt;a href="Wimbledon%20Championships"&gt;Wimbledon&lt;/a&gt; and created more problems for the clear-up at the end of another "mud bath" &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGlastonbury%20festival"&gt;Glastonbury festival&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

<h1>Election of new 7 wonders of the world: deadline approaching</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Election%20of%20new%207%20wonders%20of%20the%20world%3A%20deadline%20approaching&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The New Open World Foundation will announce the results of the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Seven%20Wonders%20of%20the%20World"&gt;New Seven Wonders of the World&lt;/a&gt; election on July 7, 2007 (or 07.07.07). The ballot itself will close on midnight the day before. The Foundation proposes a revision of the ancient &lt;a href="w%3ASeven%20Wonders%20of%20the%20World"&gt;Seven Wonders of the World&lt;/a&gt;, of which only the &lt;a href="w%3APyramids%20of%20Giza"&gt;Great Pyramid of Giza&lt;/a&gt; still exist.

Among the 21 candidates left over after the previous election round ended on January 1, 2006, the &lt;a href="w%3AAcropolis"&gt;Acropolis&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AMaya%20civilization"&gt;Maya&lt;/a&gt; archeological site of &lt;a href="w%3AChichen%20Itza"&gt;Chichen Itza&lt;/a&gt; were doing well in earlier rankings. A spokeswoman for the Foundation said earlier this month that the result is wide open.

The election ceremony will be held in &lt;a href="w%3ALisbon"&gt;Lisbon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Portugal"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt;. Hollywood actress &lt;a href="w%3AHilary%20Swank"&gt;Hilary Swank&lt;/a&gt;, British actor &lt;a href="w%3ABen%20Kingsley"&gt;Sir Ben Kingsley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABollywood"&gt;Bollywood&lt;/a&gt; actress &lt;a href="w%3ABipasha%20Basu"&gt;Bipasha Basu&lt;/a&gt; have been announced as hosts, astronaut &lt;a href="w%3ANeil%20Armstrong"&gt;Neil Armstrong&lt;/a&gt; will be present, and performers will include &lt;a href="w%3AJennifer%20Lopez"&gt;Jennifer Lopez&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AChaka%20Khan"&gt;Chaka Khan&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Countries promote their monuments</h2>

Some in &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; fear however that the &lt;a href="w%3ATaj%20Mahal"&gt;Taj Mahal&lt;/a&gt; might not make the A-list. In the &lt;a href="w%3ABihar"&gt;Bihar&lt;/a&gt; town of &lt;a href="w%3AMuzaffarpur"&gt;Muzaffarpur&lt;/a&gt;, sex workers are asking people to cast their vote for the monument in &lt;a href="w%3AAgra"&gt;Agra&lt;/a&gt;. "We are doing it in our own small way to promote the 17th century monument of love," said prostitute Shahnaj Bano. &lt;a href="w%3AMughal%20Empire"&gt;Mughal&lt;/a&gt; Emperor &lt;a href="w%3AShah%20Jahan"&gt;Shah Jahan&lt;/a&gt; ordered the construction of the mausoleum when his favourite wife died. People of all walks of life have joined the campaign in India: for example, hundreds of lawyers in Rajkot collectively casted their vote to support the Taj in the world wonder poll.

India's Tourism and Culture Minister, &lt;a href="w%3AAmbika%20Soni"&gt;Ambika Soni&lt;/a&gt;, previously pitched in the campaign by personally voting for the Taj Mahal, but government officials confirmed that they did not officially support the initiative of the for-profit organisation. "The campaign is not backed by any government agency, though we feel it is good and in the interest of the tourism industry as a whole to promote the Taj Mahal," declared Sudhir Kumar, the Agra chief of the Indian government's tourism department, to the Indo-Asian News Service.

India is not the only country trying to get a monument elected. &lt;a href="Brazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;'s soccer team for example, urged Brazilians to vote for &lt;a href="w%3AChrist%20the%20Redeemer%20%28statue%29"&gt;Christ Redeemer&lt;/a&gt;, the statue in &lt;a href="w%3ARio%20de%20Janeiro"&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Criticism on methods</h2>
The campaign started in September 1999 with a website by &lt;a href="Switzerland"&gt;Swiss&lt;/a&gt; businessman Bernard Weber. One year later, one million votes had already been cast, and today the total number of internet, text message and telephone votes has surpassed 50 million -possibly the largest global poll ever.

Earlier on in the elections, promotional campaigns have been able to severely influence the top seven. An e-mail chain letter in &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt; caused the nation to set the voting record in February 2002. After the site had been noticed in &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, the country took the lead in weeks, according to the Foundation website.

The &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (&lt;a href="w%3AUNESCO"&gt;UNESCO&lt;/a&gt;) in a press release on July 20 reaffirmed that it has no link with the initiative, which it says would reflect "only the opinions of those with access to the &lt;a href="internet"&gt;internet&lt;/a&gt;". The Foundation 'Campaign Milestones page' however claims that "more than 25 percent of the world's population is now aware of the N7W campaign" after the media attention around the time the final round began on January 1, 2006. UNESCO also criticized the project's lack of scientific foundation, when compared to its own World Heritage Sites selection method.

<h2>The candidates</h2>
Originally the Pyramids of Giza had to compete against the others in the election, but after criticism in Egypt, they were removed from the election list and made an honorary candidate. The 20 other candidates are:

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
At least four families have been left homeless after a fire ripped through an apartment in a four-apartment building at 630-632 Plymouth Avenue in &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt;. One person had to jump out of a second floor window to get to safety and one firefighter was injured while fighting the blaze.

At approximately 4:30 p.m. (&lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20American%20Eastern%20Time%20Zone"&gt;Eastern time&lt;/a&gt;) firefighters were called to the building after initial calls reported that an oven had caught on fire after grease had spilled in Apt. #4. When firefighters arrived, Apt. #4 was completely engulfed in flames.

"When [the firefighters] arrived, one person was trapped on the second floor, but jumped out of a window to the neighbors second floor porch. The fire started in a kitchen oven, maybe by grease, but an investigation is being conducted," said Buffalo Fire Department Chief Joe Fahey.

"One firefighter was injured," added Fahey. Catalano, the injured firefighter, and whose first name is not known, received a small cut under his left eye, but did not require hospitalization and was treated at the scene by paramedics.

It is estimated that there is at least "US$100,000 in damage. $60,000 damage to the building and $40,000 to the contents," said Fahey. At least three floors and two apartments were severely damaged by the fire.

All of the building's occupants made it out safely, and none were injured. Arson is not believed to be the cause.

&lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aprofessional%20wrestling"&gt;professional wrestler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Benoit"&gt;Chris Benoit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who performed for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Wrestling%20Entertainment"&gt;World Wrestling Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (WWE), was found dead, along with his wife &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANancy%20Daus"&gt;Nancy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , 43, and their son Daniel, 7, in their home in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAtlanta%2C%20Georgia"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt; on Monday. Police are calling the deaths a "double murder-&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Asuicide"&gt;suicide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ."

"There are no further details at this time, other than the Benoit family residence is currently being investigated by local authorities. WWE extends its sincerest thoughts and prayers to the Benoit family's relatives and loved ones in this time of tragedy," said a statement posted on the WWE website.

Scott Ballard, Fayette County District Attorney, says that "the details (of the incident), when they come out, are going to prove a little bizarre."

Fayette County Sheriff deputy Lt. Tommy Pope stated that police found the family at about 2:30 p.m. (eastern time) when the WWE called police and asked them to do a "welfare check" after friends stated that Benoit sent them "curious text messages." It is reported that Benoit missed several meetings which prompted the call to police. Pope also stated that police were "not actively searching for any suspects outside of the house."

In a press conference, the Sheriff's Office released the details that Benoit's wife and son had both died of asphyxiation. He also hinted that the wife had been bound. ♡❤TMZ.com♡❤ is reporting that Benoit strangled his wife on Friday, smothered his son on late Friday or early Saturday, and then hanged himself inside his weight room on late Saturday, Sunday, or Monday.

Benoit was scheduled to wrestle in &lt;a href="Houston%2C%20Texas"&gt;Houston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; for a match at WWE's ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWWE%20Vengeance%232007"&gt;Vengeance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ pay-per-view event on June 24. However, Benoit flew home due to "personal reasons," said Jim Ross, the announcer for WWE events.

Benoit was a professional wrestler with the nickname ♡❤The Canadian Crippler,♡❤ who wrestled for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Japan%20Pro%20Wrestling"&gt;New Japan Pro Wrestling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AExtreme%20Championship%20Wrestling"&gt;Extreme Championship Wrestling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Championship%20Wrestling"&gt;World Championship Wrestling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Wrestling%20Entertainment"&gt;World Wrestling Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . His wife Nancy was known in the wrestling ring as ♡❤Woman♡❤ and ♡❤Fallen Angel♡❤. She was a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AManager%20%28professional%20wrestling%29"&gt;valet and manager&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and also wrestled for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Crockett%20Promotions"&gt;Jim Crockett Promotions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Extreme Championship Wrestling and World Championship Wrestling.

The &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;U.K.&lt;/a&gt; government defined &lt;a href="w%3AIntelligent%20Design"&gt;Intelligent Design&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href="w%3Acreationism"&gt;creationism&lt;/a&gt; as religion and ruled that neither has a place within the country's school science curriculum.

This was in reaction to an electronic petition launched by James Rocks of the "Science, Just Science" campaign, a group formed to oppose "Truth in Science" and other groups in the anti-evolution lobby in the UK. The petition was signed by 1,505 people.

In the petition details, Rocks wrote, "Creationism &amp; Intelligent design are greatly featured in the media and are being used disingenuously to portray science &amp; the theory of evolution as being in crisis when they are not. Moreover groups such as Truth in Science are targeting our nation's children and their science education with material that is not only non-scientific but have been rejected by the scientific community. These ideas therefore do not constitute science, cannot be considered scientific education and therefore do not belong in the nation's science classrooms."

A spokesperson for the Prime Minister's office wrote: "The (UK) Government is aware that a number of concerns have been raised in the media and elsewhere as to whether creationism and intelligent design have a place in science lessons. The [UK] Government is clear that creationism and intelligent design are not part of the science National Curriculum programmes of study and should not be taught as science."

The government will also be "publishing guidance for schools, on the way creationism and intelligent design relate to science teaching".

In the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Future%20Cup"&gt;2007 Future Cup&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20African%20cricket%20team"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; beat &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20cricket%20team"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; in the first &lt;a href="w%3AOne-Day%20International"&gt;One-Day International&lt;/a&gt; (ODI) held at the Civil Service Cricket Club Ground, Belfast, Ireland. After South Africa won the toss and chose to field first, &lt;a href="w%3ASachin%20Tendulkar"&gt;Sachin Tendulkar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASourav%20Ganguly"&gt;Sourav Ganguly&lt;/a&gt; opened India's innings. Ganguly left quickly and &lt;a href="w%3AGautam%20Gambhir"&gt;Gautam Gambhir&lt;/a&gt; left without troubling the scorers. However, Tendulkar found some long term company with &lt;a href="w%3ARahul%20Dravid"&gt;Rahul Dravid&lt;/a&gt; and pushed the score to 194/2 before Dravid left on 74. It wasn't long before Tendulkar himself found himself runout by &lt;a href="w%3AMorne%20van%20Wyk"&gt;Morne van Wyk&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Boucher"&gt;Mark Boucher&lt;/a&gt; for 99 with the score on 211. A batting collapse ensued and at the end of the innings, India's score was 242/8. South Africa's reply started with a steady opening partnership of &lt;a href="w%3AAB%20de%20Villiers"&gt;AB de Villiers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMorne%20van%20Wyk"&gt;Morne van Wyk&lt;/a&gt; which added 56 before de Villiers departed with a catch to the keeper. &lt;a href="w%3AJacques%20Kallis"&gt;Jacques Kallis&lt;/a&gt; then came in and scored 91. Even though partnerships didn't last long, Kallis battled secured India's fate.

<h1>Paris Hilton released from jail</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Paris%20Hilton%20released%20from%20jail&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3AParis%20Hilton"&gt;Paris Hilton&lt;/a&gt; is out of jail, after serving three weeks in the same. She was imprisoned due to a violation of her probation, which came as a result of a &lt;a href="w%3ADrunk%20driving%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Driving Under the Influence&lt;/a&gt; (DUI) charge.

♡❤Reuters♡❤ reported that her face expressed joy at her release as she left the Century Regional Detention Facility in &lt;a href="w%3ALynwood%2C%20California"&gt;Lynwood, California&lt;/a&gt;, where she served 23 days, at 12:15 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Time%20Zone"&gt;PT&lt;/a&gt;. Hilton also reportedly left the jail looking a few pounds thinner than when she entered.

Ignoring the questions from the surrounding &lt;a href="w%3APaparazzi"&gt;paparazzi&lt;/a&gt; and photographers, Hilton climbed into a white sport utility vehicle where her parents, &lt;a href="w%3AKathy%20Hilton"&gt;Kathy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Hilton"&gt;Rick Hilton&lt;/a&gt;, were waiting. Dodging the photographers on the street, they then went to Hilton's grandparents' house located in &lt;a href="w%3AHolmby%20Hills%2C%20Los%20Angeles%2C%20California"&gt;Holmby Hills&lt;/a&gt;, one of the richest neighbourhoods in the state of California. The way to their destination was not clear, though; cars full of paparazzi were following them all the way. 

The &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20County%20Sheriff%27s%20Department"&gt;L.A. Sheriff's Department&lt;/a&gt; spokesman, Steve Whitmore, said "she fulfilled her debt. She was obviously in good spirits. She thanked people as she left."

While Paris's original sentence was 45 days long, she was released early based on "a standard credit applied for good behavior." 

&lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ALarry%20King"&gt;Larry King&lt;/a&gt; will be hosting an exclusive, "post-jail" interview with Paris Hilton on Wednesday, on CNN.

The discussion on the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AComprehensive%20Immigration%20Reform%20Act%20of%202007"&gt;Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which, if passed, would result in a temporary worker program, was put back on the political agenda. The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; voted 64&amp;ndash;35, which, though not sufficient to pass the bill, was enough to resume debate on the subject.

&lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; has been working to get the bill back into the agenda, making a trip to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Congress"&gt;Capitol Hill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to "twist a few arms" according to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . He also gave a speech on the subject on Tuesday morning. 

The bill faces stiff opposition from &lt;a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republicans&lt;/a&gt; in Congress, who say that "it would do little to stem the flow of illegal immigration into the United States."

President Bush spoke about the issue, saying that, "I view this as a historic opportunity for Congress to act... This is a moment for people who have been elected to come together, focus on a problem and show the American people we can fix a problem."

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATeam%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Team New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have won the third yacht race in the bid for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAmerica%27s%20Cup"&gt;America's Cup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , beating the defending champion, &lt;a href="Switzerland"&gt;Swiss&lt;/a&gt; syndicate &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAlinghi"&gt;Alinghi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Sport commentators and yachties are describing the win as one of the greatest races in the history of the Cup.

Team New Zealand finished the race 25 seconds ahead of Alinghi, despite the leader changing three times throughout the race. This new win for Team New Zealand puts the overall score at 2 wins for Team New Zealand and one win for Alinghi. The winner of the America's Cup will be the first to reach five wins.

By the first mark of the race, Team New Zealand had a lead of one minute and 23 seconds. However, at this turn, their spinnaker got caught in the genoa gear and Richard Meacham, mid bowman, almost went over board. Due to this mistake, Alinghi were able to catch up and lead the second mark by 15 seconds. Grant Dalton, head of Team New Zealand, said, "The trouble we had at the leeward mark let [Alinghi] back into the race and [Team New Zealand] paid the price."

But Team New Zealand managed to win, 25 seconds in front. Team New Zealand navigator Kevin Hall said, "My heart rate would be doing about 180 right now but it's nice to be towing in and looking at them back there instead of in front of us like they were in the second beat."

The head of Alinghi, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AErnesto%20Bertarelli"&gt;Ernesto Bertarelli&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , believes that the race committee should not have started the race, which it did so at 4:59 p.m.. The race cannot be announced after 5.00 p.m.. "We waited for two hours..."

Team New Zealand strategist Ray Davies said, "There was certainly a bit of dice rolling."

President of the Nelson Marlborough Yachting Association Doug Mckee described the race as the most exciting one since &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; winning the America's Cup when the Australians won the Auld Mug from the New York Yacht Club who had held it for 132 years. "We are definitely good enough to win the cup."

Hall said, "It probably hasn't happened very often that you see three passes in an America's Cup race. It's a testament to the strength of both teams."

The wind speed was around 8&amp;ndash;9 knots.

Alinghi beat Team New Zealand in 2003, also winning the America's Cup in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAuckland"&gt;Auckland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;.

<h3>German Wikipedia receives state funding</h3>

&lt;a href="Germany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; authorities will dedicate resources of the federal budget to improve information about renewable resources on the German version of &lt;a href="Wikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;. Entries on this topic will be managed by a private-sector body.

The challenge will be to motivate experts to get involved in the community lexicon. Such expert are used to publish in the normal newspapers. But Wikipedia is radically different: articles there continually grow with input from numerous authors, who often remain anonymous. The end product is constantly changing, and third parties can publish their own texts or even change them.

&lt;a href="w%3AGordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt; has become &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AElizabeth%20II%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom"&gt;Queen Elizabeth II&lt;/a&gt; invited him to form a government in a meeting at Buckingham Palace on Wednesday afternoon.

Brown, who has been &lt;a href="w%3AChancellor_of_the_Exchequer"&gt;Chancellor of the Exchequer&lt;/a&gt; for the past ten years, succeeds &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; who tendered his resignation to the Queen earlier on Wednesday. In an emotional &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%27s%20Questions"&gt;Prime Minister's Questions&lt;/a&gt;, Blair received a standing ovation from MPs and tributes from opposition leaders. 

Tony Blair has led the &lt;a href="w%3ALabour%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Labour Party&lt;/a&gt; since 1994 and became Prime Minister following a landslide victory in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201997"&gt;1997 general election&lt;/a&gt;. 

Gordon Brown was confirmed as leader of the Labour Party on 24th June after running unopposed in the recent &lt;a href="w%3ALabour%20Party%20%28UK%29%20leadership%20election%2C%202007"&gt;leadership election&lt;/a&gt;. He is expected to announce appointments to the &lt;a href="w%3ACabinet%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom"&gt;Cabinet&lt;/a&gt; over the next few days.

Later in the day, Tony Blair resigned his parliamentary seat for the constituency of &lt;a href="w%3ASedgefield%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29"&gt;Sedgefield&lt;/a&gt; to become an envoy to the Middle East for the &lt;a href="w%3AQuartet%20on%20the%20Middle%20East"&gt;Quartet&lt;/a&gt;, the nations and entities involved in seeking a resolution in the Middle East peace process (the United States, United Nations, European Union and Russia).

The &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Space%20Agency"&gt;European Space Agency&lt;/a&gt; (ESA) is seeking volunteers who would be ready to take a part on three simulated missions to &lt;a href="w%3AMars"&gt;Mars&lt;/a&gt;.

The anticipated missions will be a joint effort from ESA and the &lt;a href="w%3ARussian%20Federal%20Space%20Agency"&gt;Russian Federal Space Agency&lt;/a&gt;. Each crew will consist of six persons - two &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;ans and four &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;ns. The ESA is looking for 2 crewmembers and two backups that must come from ESA member nations that participate in the ELIPS program.

The flight simulation should last between 105 to 520 days in a closed modules set of total space of 500 &lt;a href="w%3ACubic%20metre"&gt;m³&lt;/a&gt;. The goal of the mission is to test the psychological stress of the long-distance travel. To make the experience as realistic as possible, the contact with the external world shall exist only via the radio with a time-delay of 40 minutes (simulating the time required for signals to travel between the Earth and Mars).

The first test of 105 days should start in middle of 2008 and the last one should start at the end 2008 or the beginning of 2009.

Interested persons can apply via an application form published on the ESA website.

The match started out poorly for the &lt;a href="Bangladesh"&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;is as they were bowled out for 89 in the first innings. The main cause of this was the outstanding bowling of Muralitharan who took a five wicket haul. The &lt;a href="Sri%20Lanka"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;ns capitalised on this and started building a mammoth of an innings of 577 before declaring six wickets down. Centuries from Michael Vandort, Mahela Jayawardene, Prasanna Jayawardene, and Chaminda Vaas , and a huge 7th wicket partnership of 223 runs, helped Sri Lanka post the total. 

Bangladesh started out their second innings positively and showed resistance to Sri Lanka's bowlers to get to 233/5 at the end of Day 3. Early on Day 4 however, Lasith Malinga turned Sri Lanka's fortunes around and ripped through the tail end of Bangladesh's lineup with 3 wickets in 30 minutes to wrap up a one-sided Test with a comprehensive innings and 234 runs victory.

&lt;b&gt;Toss: &lt;/b&gt;Sri Lanka won, and chose to field first.

The &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; would like to make it easier to dismiss employees. At the same time, social security should be improved. Then, thanks to the improved flexibility of the market, it should be simpler to find a job. Surveys show that Europeans mostly seem to agree with the need to adapt and change.

The concept of &lt;a href="w%3AFlexicurity"&gt;flexicurity&lt;/a&gt;, preached by the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Commission"&gt;European Commission&lt;/a&gt;, is aimed to encourage EU governments to unfasten their employment policies. According to &lt;a href="w%3AVladim%C3%ADr%20%C5%A0pidla"&gt;Vladimír Špidla&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Commissioner%20for%20Employment%2C%20Social%20Affairs%20%26amp%3B%20Equal%20Opportunities"&gt;European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs &amp; Equal Opportunities&lt;/a&gt;, a too protective employment policy may paralyze the labour-market. Such a policy "extends the time needed for jobseeking and the period of unemployment", writes the Commission in its report.

On its paper, the Commission is inspired by the social model of the Scandinavian countries - namely by the social system established in Denmark in the late 1990's.

♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ has learned through an investigation that anonymous edits on the Wikipedia article &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Benoit"&gt;Chris Benoit&lt;/a&gt; were added about the death of his wife &lt;a href="w%3ANancy%20Benoit"&gt;Nancy Benoit&lt;/a&gt; 14 hours before police entered the Benoit home to find the former professional &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Wrestling%20Entertainment"&gt;World Wrestling Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; (WWE) &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; wrestler and his family dead.

An anonymous edit from &lt;a href="w%3AIP%20address"&gt;IP address&lt;/a&gt; 69.120.111.23 using the Internet service provider ♡❤Optimum Online♡❤ was made at 04:01 &lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated%20Universal%20Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php%3Ftitle%3DChris_Benoit%26amp%3Bdiff%3Dprev%26amp%3Boldid%3D140442953"&gt;Chris Benoit's Wikipedia article&lt;/a&gt;. On a paragraph about an earlier fight: "However, Chris Benoit was replaced… due to personal issues,…", the anonymous editor added " ♡❤stemming from the death of his wife Nancy.♡❤" The edit was reversed just under one hour later with the comment: "Need a reliable source. Saying that his wife died is a pretty big statement, you need to back it up with something."

Then just one hour later after the first edit reversion, another anonymous edit by 125.63.148.173 using ♡❤unwiredAustralia.com.au,♡❤ a wireless Internet service provider, was made adding about the aforementioned personal issues: "♡❤which according to several pro wrestling websites is attributed to the passing of Benoit's wife, Nancy.♡❤" That edit was reverted just under 20 minutes later, with the comment: "Saying 'several pro wrestling websites' is still not reliable information."

Further investigation shows that the IP address used to make the first edit is located in &lt;a href="Connecticut"&gt;Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;, but the IP address is not linked to any computers or servers used by the WWE, but according to Cary Bass, Volunteer Coordinator for the Wikimedia Foundation, the IP address matches a location in &lt;a href="w%3AStamford%20Connecticut"&gt;Stamford, Connecticut&lt;/a&gt; where the WWE headquarters is located. Bass also informed the local authorities in Atlanta about the unusual edits, but it is not known if the edits were investigated by the police. The second edit was made by a computer in &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; from a wireless network.

"It didn't become apparent until someone put the pieces together and realized that the comment was made by someone who apparently knew about the murders," added Bass.

Fayette County Sheriff deputy Lt. Tommy Pope stated that police found the family at about 2:30 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Time%20Zone%20%28North%20America%29"&gt;ET&lt;/a&gt;, which is 18:30 UTC, on Monday when the WWE called police and asked them to do a "welfare check" after employees of WWE received calls and text messages from Chris Benoit. Early Sunday, Benoit sent repeated text messages that read "My physical address is 130 Green Meadow Lane, Fayetteville Georgia. 30215." Another text message reportedly said "The dogs are in the enclosed pool area. Garage side door is open." The messages were sent around 4:00 a.m. ET.

Earlier, on Saturday afternoon, Chris Benoit placed a series of calls that explained why he missed his flight to Houston. The stories he told were mostly about his wife and son being sick with food poisoning and vomiting. Although, in one call he said that he and Nancy were at the hospital to be with Daniel who was hospitalized. Throughout he insisted that he would attend that live event in Houston.

When he missed the live event on Sunday, and the WWE couldn't get hold of him, they contacted authorities. Police say that Benoit strangled his wife on Friday, smothered his son on late Friday or early Saturday, and then hanged himself inside his weight room on Sunday or Monday.

The Wikinews investigation is unable to conclude whether the anonymous editors had inside information about the death of Nancy Benoit.

This is not the first time Benoit's article has been edited to show false or unsourced information, as the article's edit history indicates a long history of promotional spam and vandalism. Around the time of the edits, the article contained a hidden warning to editors of the section mentioned, warning against adding rumours and speculations. For the time being, Benoit's article has been protected in an attempt to stop the addition of fraudulent information.

<h1>Sydney Opera House listed on World Heritage List</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Sydney%20Opera%20House%20listed%20on%20World%20Heritage%20List&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The World Heritage Committee of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Education%2C%20Scientific%20and%20Cultural%20Organisation"&gt;United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organisation&lt;/a&gt; has today announced in &lt;a href="w%3AChristchurch"&gt;Christchurch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;a href="w%3ASydney%20Opera%20House"&gt;Sydney Opera House&lt;/a&gt; has been added to the World Heritage List of culturally significant sites.

It is the third time that a bid has been made to include the Opera House in the list, after failing to receive enough votes in 1981 and 1996. Roni Amelan, UNESCO spokesman said the decision to list the Opera House was unanimous. 

"There was consensus that it was a truly outstanding, iconic building that was a defining moment in 20 century architecture," said Mr Amelan.

The committee described the Opera House as daring and influential. "It is a daring and visionary experiment that has had an enduring influence on the emergent architecture of the late 20th-century," claimed the committee. "The building is a great artistic monument and an icon."

The Sydney Opera House becomes the youngest building to be listed on the register, being built in October 1973. It joins other landmarks such as the &lt;a href="w%3ATaj%20Mahal"&gt;Taj Mahal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AStatue%20of%20Liberty"&gt;Statue of Liberty&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AEgyptian%20Pyramids"&gt;Egyptian Pyramids&lt;/a&gt;. The Opera House becomes only the second Australian building on the list, joining the &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Exhibition%20Building"&gt;Melbourne Royal Exhibition Building&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACarlton%20Gardens%2C%20Melbourne"&gt;Carlton Gardens&lt;/a&gt;, which were added in 2004.

As a result of the listing, a 2.5 kilometre buffer will be enforced around the Opera House to protect views to and from the building. If the World Heritage values of the site are breached, the site can be placed on an endangered list and removed from the register.

Australian &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; said the Opera House is treasured throughout the world. "The Opera House, and its setting at Bennelong Point on Sydney Harbour, is an iconic and treasured place, not just for Australians but also internationally," he said. 

An excited &lt;a href="w%3APremier%20of%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;NSW Premier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMorris%20Iemma"&gt;Morris Iemma&lt;/a&gt; informed state parliament of the UNESCO's decision.

&lt;a href="w%3AJorn%20Utzon"&gt;Jorn Utzon&lt;/a&gt;, the architect of the Opera House gave a statement from his home in &lt;a href="w%3ADenmark"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt; expressing the honour of having one of his buildings listed on the register.

"World Heritage listing gives the building ... a completely new value," Mr Utzon said. "It is a gift to the city of Sydney." Mr Utzon said it was the vision of those who worked on the construction of the Opera House for it to be Sydney's greatest landmark.

<h3>New pictures from Mars</h3>
The space probe &lt;a href="w%3AMars%20Express"&gt;Mars Express&lt;/a&gt; has provided new pictures - with ground resolution of approximately 13 metres per pixel - of the &lt;a href="w%3AMensa%20%28geology%29"&gt;Aeolis Mensae&lt;/a&gt; region.

This &lt;a href="w%3AMars"&gt;Martian&lt;/a&gt; area is currently subject of discussion for unexplained features.
According some theories, the shaping of the surface could be result also of aeolian, wind-erosion, glacial or other activities.

<h3>Testing the theory of relativity on the existence of gravitational waves</h3>

The European laser interferometer (&lt;a href="w%3AVirgo%20interferometer"&gt;VIRGO&lt;/a&gt;) is going to test the Albert Einstein's theory on the existence of gravitational waves.

The VIRGO teams cooperates with the &lt;a href="w%3ALIGO"&gt;LIGO&lt;/a&gt; (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory) in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AGEO%20600"&gt;GEO 600&lt;/a&gt; (German-UK Gravitation Wave Detector).

Pope &lt;a href="Pope%20Benedict%20XVI"&gt;Benedict XVI&lt;/a&gt; has approved a document that would allow greater use of the &lt;a href="w%3ATridentine%20Mass"&gt;Tridentine Mass&lt;/a&gt; (also known as the Latin Mass). 

The Latin Mass was used almost universally by Catholic Churches prior to the &lt;a href="w%3ASecond%20Vatican%20Council"&gt;Vatican II&lt;/a&gt; council in the 1960s which promulgated many different reforms, including options for churches to use vernacular in some parts of the liturgy. 

Under the current rules, priests must obtain permission from their local bishop to use Tridentine Mass while the new rules will allow priests to make the decision themselves. 

According to Cardinal &lt;a href="w%3ADar%C3%ADo%20Castrill%C3%B3n%20Hoyos"&gt;Darío Castrillón Hoyos&lt;/a&gt;, the move towards widening the use of the Tridentine Mass was done in part to help bring back to the main church body various schismatic groups, such as the &lt;a href="w%3ASociety%20of%20St.%20Pius%20X"&gt;Society of St. Pius X&lt;/a&gt; that reject Vatican II's reforms. 

The proposal has met with concern from the liberal end of the Catholic Church who worry that it signals the beginning of a return to pre-Vatican II church policies and theology while Jewish groups have expressed concern over elements of the Tridentine Mass which they see as offensive or possibly worrisome, such as parts which call for the conversion of the Jews.

<h1>Indonesia shuts down 4 airlines and grounds 5 others over safety concerns</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Indonesia%20shuts%20down%204%20airlines%20and%20grounds%205%20others%20over%20safety%20concerns&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; has shut down four airlines and grounded five others with the potential of similar licence revocations for failing to meet safety standards.

The largest company to lose its licence is &lt;a href="w%3AJatayu%20Gelang%20Sejahtera"&gt;Jatayu Gelang Sejahtera&lt;/a&gt;. The other companies are all small airlines operating only aircraft with a passenger capacity of fewer than thirty, and are Aviasi Upataraksa, Alfa Trans Dirgantara and Prodexim. The companies that were grounded pending either improvements or licence revokation are Germania Trisila Air, Atlas Delta Setia, Survey Udara Penas, Kura-kura Aviation and SMAC, all of which also operate only aircraft with under-30 passenger capacities. They have three months to improve, or their licences will be revoked.

Jatayu had already ceased operations in August, but had intended to restart with a 150-seat &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20737"&gt;Boeing 737&lt;/a&gt;. The licence was revoked because the state requires at least two aircraft to be commercially operated and because of the fact that it "was lacking in pilots and human resources". Also, the age of the jetliner meant that it would require a test called a 'C-Check' before it could begin commercial services, at a cost of $120,000.

The action comes as the result of a number of air crashes, namely the &lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20Air%20Flight%20574"&gt;Adam Air Flight 574&lt;/a&gt; disaster in which 102 people were killed, and the &lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20Air%20Flight%20172"&gt;Adam Air Flight 172&lt;/a&gt; accident, in which a plane snapped in half during a hard landing, but managed to hold together, thus preventing any serious injuries. As a result, all 54 of Indonesia's airlines were given a safety rating, with a level-1 rating meaning no action was needed, a level-2 rating meaning the airline needed to make some improvements, and a level-3 rating requiring that the airline be shut down unless improvements were made within three months. Most airlines received a level-2 rating, while none received the top rating. &lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20Air"&gt;Adam Air&lt;/a&gt; was among the airlines to receive the level-3 rating, but was upgraded to tier 2 at the same time as the groundings.

Meanwhile, state-owned &lt;a href="w%3AGaruda%20Indonesia"&gt;Garuda Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; is now the only airline to have a type-1 rating, despite the fatal crash of &lt;a href="w%3AGaruda%20Indonesia%20Flight%20200"&gt;Garuda Indonesia Flight 200&lt;/a&gt; in March. According to the Indonesian Transport Ministry's Director General for Aviation Budi Mulyawan Suyitno, Garuda now satisfied 84 percent of civil aviation standards.

The ratings have been based on such criteria as surveillance, ramp checks, personnel, department safety, number of accidents and number of serious incidents, according to the &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, ♡❤Flight Global♡❤ is reporting that, according to Directorate General of Air Communications (DGAC) director of air certification office, Yurlis Hasibuan “20 criteria including whether the airline has developed [better] safety and human resources” are checked.

The &lt;a href="w%3AComprehensive%20Immigration%20Reform%20Act%20of%202007"&gt;Comprehensive Immigration Reform Bill&lt;/a&gt; backed by both &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Massachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; Senator &lt;a href="w%3ATed%20Kennedy"&gt;Ted Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; failed to receive enough cloture votes to overcome a possible filibuster and move on to a final vote in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;United States Senate&lt;/a&gt;. The cloture vote was 53 votes against and 46 votes in favor; 60 votes are needed to invoke cloture in the Senate.

The large, complex bill was a compromise referred to as the "grand bargain" that would have made many changes to American immigration laws, including an expanded "guest worker" plan and a "path to citizenship" for immigrants currently residing illegally in America. The bill was largely drafted behind closed doors in negotiations between the White House and Senate leaders of both parties.

Proponents argued that the bill would have fixed enforcement problems with current immigration policy and that it was a reasonable compromise, while opponents charged that it amounted to an "illegal alien amnesty". Public opinion polls showed that the bill was unpopular among Americans surveyed, many of whom believed it would make things worse. According to &lt;a href="w%3ARasmussen%20Reports"&gt;Rasmussen Reports&lt;/a&gt;, only 22% of Americans favored the bill as of June 25.

"Bush wanted to do something good, but the Senate wouldn't let him. It's disappointing," Miguel Gonzalez told ♡❤Reuters♡❤. Gonzales has been in the United States for five years.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Indies%20cricket%20team"&gt;West Indies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have beaten &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEngland%20cricket%20team"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by 15 runs in the first &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATwenty20"&gt;Twenty20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; international of their &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Indian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%202007"&gt;tour of England&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Oval"&gt;The Oval&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEngland"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The West Indian innings started off badly by losing Gayle early, however they turned their fortunes around with some attacking and aggressive cricket and posted a huge total of 208. A bigger total could have been posted if it had not been for a late innings batting collapse. England started their reply by getting off to a flyer, but lost some early wickets that slowed down the run-rate. Leading the charge was Paul Collingwood with a fast 79 with 5 4's and 4 6's. In the end, England fell short by 15 runs. Had they not have lost the early wickets, England would have probably won the match to take a 1-0 lead in the series. Instead, it is West Indies that have taken a 1-0 lead in the series.

Former First Lady "Lady Bird" Johnson was released Thursday after a week at Seton Hospital after being admitted for tests because she was not feeling well. She is the widow of &lt;a href="w%3ALyndon%20B.%20Johnson"&gt;Lyndon B. Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, President of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; from 1963 to 1969. She is best known for her conservation and beautification efforts involving wildflowers and roadsides.

As President Johnson and his wife, &lt;a href="w%3ALady%20Bird%20Johnson"&gt;Lady Bird Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, criss-crossed States by road during the 1964 presidential campaign, she informed her husband of her feelings about the roadside junkyards they saw along the way. Inspired by her comments and enthusiasm from audiences, he observed "If it's beautifying they want, it's beautifying they'll get." Recognizing that "ours is an automobile society," the President did not want to curtail roads. He wanted to make roads the "highways to the enjoyment of nature and beauty." Lady Bird thought that her love of seeing Texas highways in spring had influenced her husband. She enjoyed the results of Texan wildflower conservation programs which began in the 1930s.

One of the most prominent results of the President's beauty initiative was the &lt;a href="w%3AHighway%20Beautification%20Act%20of%201965"&gt;Highway Beautification Act of 1965&lt;/a&gt;. It created restrictions on billboards and junkyards. As expected, it had been controversial. When the House considered its version of the bill on October 7, the debate lasted into the early morning hours of October 8. A pointed but tongue-in-cheek amendment by Representative Robert Dole (R-Kan.) to strike out the term "Secretary of Commerce" wherever it appeared in the bill and insert the words "Lady Bird" lost by a voice vote. Saying, "Beauty belongs to all the people," the President signed the bill and gave the first pen to Lady Bird, along with a kiss on the cheek.

In 1982, she founded the National Wildflower Research Center to continue the mission of changing public attitudes toward native plants. In 1997 it was renamed the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center.

The anonymous individual responsible for suggesting, 14 hours before police discovered the body, that &lt;a href="w%3AWWE"&gt;WWE&lt;/a&gt; wrestler &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Benoit"&gt;Chris Benoit's&lt;/a&gt; wife was dead is saying his/her comment was a "terrible coincidence."
In a post made at 12:26 AM EDT Friday morning to the of a ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ article headlined as the "&lt;a href="Death%20of%20Nancy%20Benoit%20rumour%20posted%20on%20Wikipedia%20hours%20prior%20to%20body%20being%20found"&gt;Death of Nancy Benoit rumour posted on Wikipedia hours prior to body being found&lt;/a&gt;", the user admitted to writing that &lt;a href="w%3ANancy%20Benoit"&gt;Nancy Benoit&lt;/a&gt; was dead at the Wikipedia article page for Benoit came from information that was garnered from "rumors and speculation online." 

The &lt;a href="w%3AIP%20address"&gt;IP Address&lt;/a&gt; of the individual making the apology was identical to that of the one who posted the Nancy Benoit rumor, a strong confirmation of the admission's authenticity. The lengthy apology was not signed, with the individual claiming, "I am just an everyday individual who posted a wrongful remark at the time that received so much attention because it turned out to actually happen." 

Wikinews originally broke the story about the suspicious edit after receiving a tip from Wikipedia administrators. The fact the edit originated from a computer in Stamford, Connecticut (the site of WWE headquarters) appears to be another coincidence.

The anonymous editor left a lengthy apology to the Wikimedia community, explaining, "I hope this puts an end to this speculation that someone knew about the tragedy before it was discovered."

Wikinews is continuing to follow the story, but the anonymous user has declined an interview.

Below is the full, unedited apology:

A car containing an large explosive device has been defused in &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Haymarket"&gt;the Haymarket&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;. A second device was later found in a car park in &lt;a href="w%3APark%20Lane%20%28road%29"&gt;Park Lane&lt;/a&gt;.

A car, a light metallic green &lt;a href="w%3AMercedes-Benz%20E%20Class"&gt;Mercedes-Benz E Class&lt;/a&gt; saloon (produced 1984-1995), parked near the nightclub 'TigerTiger', contained &lt;a href="w%3Apetrol"&gt;petrol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Agas%20cylinders"&gt;gas cylinders&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANail%20%28engineering%29"&gt;nails&lt;/a&gt;. Police described it as a "potentially viable explosive device". 

Police carried out a controlled explosion at 2:00 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20European%20Summer%20Time"&gt;BST&lt;/a&gt; and the car has been taken to a forensic explosives laboratory for further investigation.

Eyewitnesses saw the car driving "erratically" and colliding with bins before being abandoned. An ambulance crew in the area alerted police after seeing smoke inside the car.

Deputy Assistant Police Commissioner Peter Clarke said there could have been "significant injury or loss of life". 

A meeting of &lt;a href="w%3ACabinet%20Office%20Briefing%20Rooms"&gt;COBRA&lt;/a&gt;, chaired by new &lt;a href="w%3AHome%20Secretary"&gt;Home Secretary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJacqui%20Smith"&gt;Jacqui Smith&lt;/a&gt; was held about the incident.

Police say it is too early to tell who is behind the threat. Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AGordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt; said the country faces a "serious and continued security threat" and urged people to "be vigilant at all times".

Disruption has been caused to transport in the area with roads closed and bus routes diverted. &lt;a href="w%3APiccadilly%20Circus%20tube%20station"&gt;Piccadilly Circus tube station&lt;/a&gt; has reopened after an earlier closure

Police are reviewing major events to be held in London over the weekend.

♡❤CBS News♡❤ has reported that a message appeared on the widely used &lt;a href="w%3Ajihad"&gt;jihad&lt;/a&gt;ist &lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20forum"&gt;Internet forum&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAl-Hesbah"&gt;Al-Hesbah&lt;/a&gt; at 8:09 a.m. June 28, saying: "Today I say: Rejoice, by Allah, London shall be bombed." The message went on to mention the recently announced &lt;a href="w%3AKnighthood%20of%20Salman%20Rushdie"&gt;knighthood&lt;/a&gt; of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Satanic%20Verses"&gt;Satanic Verses&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ author &lt;a href="w%3ASalman%20Rushdie"&gt;Salman Rushdie&lt;/a&gt;.

Following an &lt;a href="Car%20driven%20into%20Glasgow%20International%20Airport"&gt;incident at Glasgow airport&lt;/a&gt;, Home Secretary Jacqui Smith announced the elevation of the UK's national threat level from "Severe" to "Critical", indicating that an attack could be expected "imminently". 

Two people have been arrested in &lt;a href="w%3ACheshire"&gt;Cheshire&lt;/a&gt; in connection with the Glasgow International Airport attack and attempted London car bombings.

<h3>Park Lane</h3>
&lt;a href="w%3APark%20Lane%20%28road%29"&gt;Park Lane&lt;/a&gt; was closed to the public due to a suspicious car parked in the underground car park beneath Hyde Park. Police, who believed the two incidents to be linked, cordoned off Park Lane and Hyde Park to allow the bomb disposal unit access to the vehicle. The car was illegally parked on &lt;a href="w%3ACockspur%20Street"&gt;Cockspur Street&lt;/a&gt; and was towed to the pound on Park Lane, it was then discovered that the car contained an explosive device.

Stock in the &lt;a href="w%3ABlackstone%20Group"&gt;Blackstone Group&lt;/a&gt;, a major &lt;a href="w%3APrivate%20equity"&gt;private equity&lt;/a&gt; founded by &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20George%20Peterson"&gt;Peter G. Peterson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20A.%20Schwarzman"&gt;Stephen Schwarzman&lt;/a&gt;, has fallen below its &lt;a href="w%3AInitial%20public%20offering"&gt;initial public offering&lt;/a&gt; price of US$31.00. 

Blackstone L.P. (&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Stock%20Exchange"&gt;NYSE&lt;/a&gt; symbol: BX) initially soared 13 percent after being offered on the New York Stock Exchange last week. However, lately the stock has dropped to below $30. The stock was issued to brokerages for $31 a share. 

Some fear that the so-called "Private Equity Boom" may be at its peak. Others attribute the falling price to recent discussions in Washington of changing laws that critics call "loopholes," which allow such firms to pay capital gains tax instead of income tax.

Jo Hovind, wife of &lt;a href="w%3AKent%20Hovind"&gt;Kent Hovind&lt;/a&gt;, was sentenced to one year and one day in prison for 44 counts of evading bank reporting requirements. In November 2006 Jo was convicted of 44 counts and Kent was convicted of 58 counts, and both decided not to present a defense at trial. 

Kent Hovind, self-styled as ♡❤Dr. Dino♡❤ despite lacking any degrees from accredited schools, is currently incarcerated at &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Correctional%20Institution%2C%20Edgefield"&gt;Federal Correctional Institution, Edgefield&lt;/a&gt;, and according to the &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Bureau%20of%20Prisons"&gt;Federal Bureau of Prisons&lt;/a&gt; is scheduled for release in July 2015.

In addition to the prison time Jo Hovind, 51, was ordered to pay US$8,000 in fines and serve three years supervision when released from prison. In January 2007 Kent was ordered to pay $640,000 in owed funds to the &lt;a href="w%3AInternal%20Revenue%20Service"&gt;Internal Revenue Service&lt;/a&gt; (IRS), pay prosecution's court costs of $7,078, and serve three years parole once released.

Though the couple were indicted on these charges last summer in July 2006, they had a long history of &lt;a href="w%3ATax%20protester"&gt;tax protesting&lt;/a&gt; and running the &lt;a href="w%3AKent%20Hovind%23Creation%20Science%20Evangelism%20Ministry"&gt;Creation Science Evangelism Ministry&lt;/a&gt; without proper licensing. According to the IRS, Kent Hovind had never filed any income taxes with the agency.

Mrs. Hovind was found guilty in November on 44 counts of evading bank-reporting requirements. The same jury found her husband guilty on 58 federal counts, including failure to pay $845,000 in employee-related taxes. He was sentenced in January to ten years in federal prison.

According to the &lt;a href="w%3APensacola%20News%20Journal"&gt;Pensacola News Journal&lt;/a&gt;, Jo Hovind’s attorney, Jerry Barringer, plans to appeal the guilty verdict as well as the prison sentence.

The &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; banned all of &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;'s air carriers yesterday, none of which presently operate services to &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;, as well as several from &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Ukraine"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Angola"&gt;Angola&lt;/a&gt;. They are the latest additions to the already extensive &lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20air%20carriers%20banned%20in%20the%20EU"&gt;List of air carriers banned in the EU&lt;/a&gt;. The ban is scheduled to come into effect on July 6. Just hours after the ban a &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20737"&gt;Boeing 737&lt;/a&gt; operated by one of the blacklisted airlines, &lt;a href="w%3ATAAG%20Angola%20Airlines"&gt;TAAG Angola Airlines&lt;/a&gt;, crashed into a house during landing, causing at least six fatalities in Northern Angola.

Indonesia currently has 51 airlines, having grounded several and revoked the licences of others on June 25. The EU said that substandard maintenance and operation and a slow reaction by Indonesia to solve the problem were the main causes of the ban. EU holidaymakers who have booked flights with banned airlines via &lt;a href="w%3Atravel%20agent"&gt;travel agent&lt;/a&gt;s will be refunded for the services. 

EU transport commissioner Jacques Barrot said of the ban "Once more, the EU blacklist will prove to be an essential tool not only to prevent unsafe airlines from flying to Europe and to inform passengers travelling worldwide, but also to make sure that airlines and civil aviation authorities take appropriate actions to improve safety."

Operations and safety editor at ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AFlight%20International"&gt;Flight International&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ David Learmount commented that Indonesia, whose airline industry was deregulated the early 1990s, is one of a handful of cases where deregulation has lowered safety standards instead of improving them, saying of the move by the EU "Standards in aviation safety have been going up dramatically on a worldwide basis, but there are still places where they are [of the standards of] the 70s and 80s. In Indonesia the safety watchdog was told earlier this year to pull its socks up, but the EU is clearly convinced that it has not done so." 

One unnamed EU official was reported by ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Guardian"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ to have described Indonesia's civil aviation authority as "not very reliable", referring to a lack of reaction to warnings of an imminent ban and requests that Indonesia reassured officials that the problem was being dealt with. 

Indonesia has responded to the ban by saying that, according to information unseen by the EU, Indonesian safety standards are rising. Director-general of civil aviation at the Indonesian transport ministry &lt;a href="w%3ABudhi%20Mulyawan%20Suyitno"&gt;Budhi Mulyawan Suyitno&lt;/a&gt; told ♡❤Reuters♡❤ new agency that, "Our data can show them that we have improved on every line. The US had already downgraded Indonesia's safety rating earlier this year.

Also affected by the bans are Ukraine's &lt;a href="w%3AVolare%20Aviation"&gt;Volare Aviation&lt;/a&gt;, while Russia has imposed bans on four of its airlines after consulting the EU and restricted six others, &lt;a href="Bulgaria"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt; has revoked the licences of six cargo airlines and &lt;a href="Moldova"&gt;Moldova&lt;/a&gt; has banned eight airlines.

Meanwhile, &lt;a href="w%3APakistan%20International%20Airlines"&gt;Pakistan International Airlines&lt;/a&gt;, subject of a controversial EU ban earlier this year, had restrictions on some of its aircraft lifted. The airline's fleet of &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20777"&gt;Boeing 777&lt;/a&gt;s and some of their &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20747"&gt;Boeing 747&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href="w%3AAirbus%20310"&gt;Airbus 310&lt;/a&gt;s will now be allowed back into European airspace.

The announcements come after three accidents involving Indonesian airliners - the New Year's Day crash of &lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20Air%20Flight%20574"&gt;Adam Air Flight 574&lt;/a&gt;, which killed 102 people, the subsequent accident involving &lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20Air%20Flight%20172"&gt;Adam Air Flight 172&lt;/a&gt;, which cracked in half on a hard landing but held together, preventing serious injury, and the March crash of state-run &lt;a href="w%3AGaruda%20Indonesia%20Flight%20200"&gt;Garuda Indonesia Flight 200&lt;/a&gt;, which claimed 23 lives. All the accidents involved ageing Boeing 737 aircraft.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANFL"&gt;NFL&lt;/a&gt; has announced that its "farmer-league" &lt;a href="w%3ANFL%20Europa"&gt;NFL Europa&lt;/a&gt; has been discontinued after 15 seasons. Instead, the NFL will change "the focus of its international business strategy to presenting the NFL to the widest possible global audience, including broader media visibility and the staging of international regular-season games." "The time is right to re-focus the NFL's strategy on initiatives with global impact, including worldwide media coverage of our sport and the staging of live regular-season NFL games,'" said Mark Waller, senior vice president of NFL International, to NFL.com

The NFL is focusing on the international market now. In October, the owners passed a resolution to set up to two regular-season games in international stadiums per year. The first of these games will be played at &lt;a href="w%3AWembley%20Stadium"&gt;Wembley Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; on October 28 when the &lt;a href="w%3AMiami%20Dolphins"&gt;Miami Dolphins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Giants"&gt;New York Giants&lt;/a&gt; meet.

In 2006, NFL Europa changed its name from NFL Europe to NFL Europa to focus more on the German and Dutch markets. When NFL Europa shut down, it had six teams based in Holland and Germany. The &lt;a href="w%3AHamburg%20Sea%20Devils"&gt;Hamburg Sea Devils&lt;/a&gt; won the last &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Bowl"&gt;World Bowl&lt;/a&gt; (number 15) last Saturday. Two of the players that were developed in NFL Europa were Arizona Cardinals QB Kurt Warner and Indianapolis Colts K Adam Vinatieri.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEngland%20cricket%20team"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have beaten &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Indies%20cricket%20team"&gt;West Indies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by five wickets in the second &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATwenty20"&gt;Twenty20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; international of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Indian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%202007"&gt;West Indies tour of England&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Oval"&gt;The Oval&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;.

England's victory tied the two match series 1-1 after West Indies won the &lt;a href="West%20Indies%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%202007-1st%20Twenty20"&gt;first Twenty20&lt;/a&gt; yesterday.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Gayle"&gt;Chris Gayle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; got the West Indies off to a good start with 61 runs off 37 balls, but the England bowlers and fielders restricted their score to 169-7 after 20 overs despite some big hits from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMarlon%20Samuels"&gt;Marlon Samuels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

In reply, England faltered, losing three wickets in 14 balls followed by the dismissal of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Pietersen"&gt;Kevin Pietersen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for 19. However &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOwais%20Shah"&gt;Owais Shah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; scored 55 to help England past the target.

The tour now moves on to a series of three &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOne-Day%20International"&gt;One-Day International&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; matches starting on 1st July. Earlier in the tour, England won a four match &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATest%20cricket"&gt;Test&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; series 3-0.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=America%27s%20Cup%3A%20Alinghi%20are%20fifth%20race%20victors&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The Swiss yachting team, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAlinghi"&gt;Alinghi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , have defeated &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATeam%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Team New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the fifth race for the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A32nd%20America%27s%20Cup"&gt;32nd America's Cup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The overall score is now 3-2 to Alinghi.

Alinghi won the race by 19 seconds, though throughout the pre-start race each yacht was within close distance of each other. Team New Zealand, racing with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANZL-92"&gt;NZL-92&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , crossed the start line first and reached a 12 second lead at the first mark. But when Team New Zealand were preparing to fly a new kite, their spinnaker ripped in two and went flying into the air. Their second spinnaker was not tied on properly and the third one got tangled half way up.

Team New Zealand managed to free the first two and untangle the third to continue the race, making up some of the 140 metres Alinghi had created in the three minute hold up.

Grant Dalton, managing director of Team New Zealand, said, "That was an important race and it wasn't one we should have lost on a mistake on a move we've practised time and again."

The team first to five wins, wins the "&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAuld%20Mug"&gt;Auld Mug&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ".

Police have detonated a suspicious package in the airport of &lt;a href="w%3AIbiza"&gt;Ibiza&lt;/a&gt;, (&lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;), which had been evacuated after a newspaper received a bomb threat made in the name of &lt;a href="w%3ABasque"&gt;Basque&lt;/a&gt; separatist group &lt;a href="w%3AETA"&gt;ETA&lt;/a&gt;. About 3,000 tourists were evacuated from the airport, and hundreds of flights have either been delayed or cancelled.

Spain has been on a heightened alert since ETA declared an end to a unilateral ceasefire on June 5.

Ibiza is a very popular tourist destination, especially due to its legendary nightlife. Thousands of people flood in during the summer for the big summer club nights.

Yaderlin (Hiraldo) Jimenez, the wife of missing &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; soldier Spc. &lt;a href="w%3AMay%202007%20abduction%20of%20US%20soldiers%20in%20Iraq"&gt;Alex Jimenez&lt;/a&gt;, who was due to be deported has been granted a Green Card by &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Citizenship%20and%20Immigration%20Services"&gt;U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services&lt;/a&gt;.

Mrs. Jimenez's Immigration troubles began shortly after her wedding to Spc. Jimenez on June 14, 2004, at Fort Drum, NY where his U.S. Army unit was stationed. When the couple attempted to cross the border between the U.S. and Canada on their honeymoon, the newlyweds were detained, held for several hours and released.

In 2006, the couple were granted a deferment of immigration proceedings until Spc. Jimenez returned from his second tour of duty in Iraq. However on June 20 the government announced its intent to deport Yaderlin Jimenez, despite the fact that her husband was declared missing along with two other soldiers, last month.

The case quickly received national attention and the involvement of influential U.S. Senators &lt;a href="w%3ATed%20Kennedy"&gt;Ted Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Kerry"&gt;John Kerry&lt;/a&gt;. Two days later, Homeland Security Chief &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Chertoff"&gt;Michael Chertoff&lt;/a&gt; announced that he had instructed immigration authorities to take immediate action to resolve the case of Yaderlin Jimenez.

Yesterday, while standing victorious with his client on the steps of &lt;a href="w%3ACitizenship%20and%20Naturalization%20Services"&gt;Citizenship and Naturalization Services&lt;/a&gt; building in downtown Buffalo, NY, Jimenez's attorney Matthew Kolken said now that this ordeal is behind her, she can return to "using all of her focus and energies to hope and pray that her husband's going to come home alive."

&lt;a href="w%3AGlasgow%20International%20Airport"&gt;Glasgow International Airport&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ARenfrewshire"&gt;Renfrewshire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AScotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; was evacuated after a green &lt;a href="w%3AJeep%20Cherokee%20%28XJ%29"&gt;Jeep Cherokee&lt;/a&gt; struck the airport's terminal building and burst into flames at 1511 BST. 

An eyewitness told the &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; that "[A] man was on fire." All flights are grounded, and two men have been arrested and the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; has raised the national threat level to "critical" which means another terror attack is imminent.

Eyewitnesses described a Jeep speeding toward the building with flames coming out from underneath. They also reported seeing two Asian men in the car, one of whom was on fire.
The BBC quoted an eyewitness as saying that two attempts were made to ram the Jeep through the wall, and that the passenger was holding a lit &lt;a href="w%3AMolotov%20Cocktail"&gt;Molotov Cocktail&lt;/a&gt; and made several attempts to throw the bottle.

The &lt;a href="w%3AStrathclyde"&gt;Strathclyde&lt;/a&gt; Police Chief announced that the event is being linked to the earlier attempted &lt;a href="Car%20bomb%20defused%20in%20central%20London"&gt;car bombings in London&lt;/a&gt;, and as such is being treated as a terrorist investigation.

Eyewitnesses are now saying that one of the two men was pouring bottles of petrol into the car's interior and onto himself, before running from the car, on fire, into the main terminal building. Witnesses have also reported that gas cylinders were removed by bystanders from the burning vehicle.

According to the BBC, the driver of the vehicle put up a violent struggle before being overpowered by the police and public. One person who tackled him was Stephen Clarkson, a member of the public.

Richard Gray, an eyewitness to the event, stated "There was an Asian guy who was pulled out of the car by two police officers."

Seven people have been taken to local hospitals with injuries.

Police said that this incident was a deliberate attempt and not a road accident. Officials have also said that the incident is connected to earlier attempted car bombings in London the day before. 

Two people have been arrested, one of whom was badly burned. Seven known casualties, including the Asian male have been taken to the &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Alexandra%20Hospital"&gt;Royal Alexandra Hospital&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APaisley"&gt;Paisley&lt;/a&gt;.

While the suspect was being treated in the hospital, a suspect device was discovered in the hospital, resulting in the partial evacuation of the building while the device was moved to a safe area. This object later turned out to be mundane, although initial reports believed it to be a suicide belt.
The BBC announced that the &lt;a href="Gordon%20Brown"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; is being kept fully informed. He chaired a meeting of &lt;a href="w%3ACivil%20Contingencies%20Committee"&gt;Civil Contingencies Committee&lt;/a&gt; (COBRA) at 1900 (BST), after which the Home Secretary, &lt;a href="w%3AJacqui%20Smith"&gt;Jacqui Smith&lt;/a&gt;, announced that the national threat level been elevated from "Severe" to "Critical", meaning another attack is expected "imminently."

Officials at &lt;a href="w%3AEdinburgh%20Airport"&gt;Edinburgh Airport&lt;/a&gt; have said that all cars are being turned away from the airport, and at &lt;a href="w%3AHeathrow%20airport"&gt;Heathrow&lt;/a&gt; in London, passengers are being advised not to bring private cars near to the terminal buildings. Some passengers were kept waiting in planes while the area was secured.

The first bomber, who was taken to Govan high security prison, has now been interviewed, though no further statements from Strathclyde police have been forthcoming. The second bomber, who was taken to the Royal Alexandria hospital in Paisley, is listed in critical condition tonight, and is being kept under 24-hour guard.

2,300 passengers who were due to set off from Glasgow Airport today have been driven by coach to a conference centre, where a reception area has been set up for them.

Two people were arrested by &lt;a href="w%3AMetropolitan%20Police%20Anti-Terrorist%20Branch"&gt;The Metropolitan Police Anti-Terrorist Branch&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="w%3AM6%20motorway"&gt;M6 motorway&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ACheshire"&gt;Cheshire&lt;/a&gt; in connection with the Glasgow International Airport attack and attempted London car bombings.

The &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt; is expected to hold another COBRA meeting with other members of the Cabinet today. This will be the fifth COBRA meeting in 48 hours.

Many of the 302 million people living in the United States celebrated &lt;a href="w%3AFourth%20of%20July"&gt;Independence Day&lt;/a&gt; today. 

<h2>Formal observations</h2>

There often are public ceremonies and declarations by officials.
<ul>
BULLET::::- President Bush's Independence Day message was:
<dl>
BULLET::::- "I send greetings to Americans everywhere celebrating Independence Day.
BULLET::::- "Two hundred thirty-one years ago, 56 brave men signed their names to a bold creed of freedom that set the course of our Nation and changed the history of the world. On this anniversary, we remember the great courage and conviction of our Founders, and we celebrate the enduring principles of our Declaration of Independence.
BULLET::::- "Through selfless sacrifice and unrelenting determination, the patriots of the American Revolution ensured that our Nation's claim to liberty and equality would not be dismissed or forgotten. The ideals they fought for and the country they helped establish are lasting symbols of hope to the entire world.
BULLET::::- "Our commitment to America's founding truths remains steadfast. We believe that freedom is a blessing from the Almighty and the birthright of every man and woman. As our Nation faces new challenges, we are answering history's call with confidence that our legacy of freedom will always prevail. On Independence Day, we express our gratitude to the generations of courageous Americans who have defended us and those who continue to serve in our country's hour of need, and we celebrate the liberty that makes America a light to the nations.
BULLET::::- "Laura and I wish you a Happy Fourth of July. May God bless you, and may He bless our wonderful country."
</dl>
BULLET::::- Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi promised to make the day "Energy Independence Day".

</ul>
<h2>Public events</h2>
There were many public events, including parades and public festivals with various entertainment and food attractions.

<h3>Fireworks</h3>
The day is traditionally celebrated with fireworks, often with large performances by social and government organizations.

<ul>
BULLET::::- Cancellation of Mount Rushmore's July 3 fireworks show was considered due to dry conditions, but it was decided at 9 p.m. to proceed. 5,200 shells and pyrotechnics were used in the 27 minute show. The fireworks were preceded by a day filled with music and dance for visitors at the park.
BULLET::::- The finale for events in the nation's capitol was musical events, with cannon fire by the U.S. Presidential Salute Battery, and a fireworks display.
BULLET::::- The Boston Pops 2007 event was on the Esplanade in Boston, with a concert preceding a fireworks display.

</ul>
<h2>Family activities</h2>

Occurring well into summer, this federal holiday was celebrated by many during family events and activities. It was expected that many would take vacation time from work during the week, particularly as the holiday being in mid-week allows five days of vacation by only taking two days off from work. Among the activities of July 4, the most common activities are picnics in the daytime, barbeques at evening, and fireworks at night.

In recent years, more and more Americans have gained interests in setting off their own fireworks. Consumer fireworks are banned in many places due to their perceived dangers, but fireworks enthusiasts cite that fireworks are safe when used properly. According to the &lt;a href="w%3ACPSC"&gt;CPSC&lt;/a&gt;, the amount of imported fireworks have roughly tripled during the last ten years, while the rate of injuries has gone down.

The &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJoint%20Terrorism%20Analysis%20Centre"&gt;Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre&lt;/a&gt; (JTAC), a division of the security agency &lt;a href="w%3AMI5"&gt;MI5&lt;/a&gt;, has raised its threat level to critical. Critical denotes that a terrorist attack is expected imminently. The threat is noted as being from &lt;a href="w%3AAl-Qaida"&gt;al-Qaida&lt;/a&gt;, groups associated with al-Qaida, and other Islamic extremists. The change was made as a result of an earlier incident where a burning jeep drove into Glasgow Airport, which has been linked to the attempted London car bombings of the previous day.

MI5 also indicated that, although the threat comes principally from al-Qaida and related networks, Northern Ireland-related terrorism remains a threat.

In a press release Saturday, &lt;a href="w%3AHome%20Secretary"&gt;Home Secretary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJacqui%20Smith"&gt;Jacqui Smith&lt;/a&gt; said, "I can confirm that JTAC has raised the national threat level to critical. This is in response to the events of the last 48 hours. Critical is the highest level of threat, and the threat level will be closely reviewed on a regular basis. Appropriate security measures have been put in place."

A terror alert system was set up by the UK government to keep the public informed about the level of threat to the UK from terrorism. According to the Home Office, the likelihood of a terrorist attack taking place in the UK is identified in following threat levels:

<ul>
BULLET::::- critical - an attack is expected imminently
BULLET::::- severe - an attack is highly likely
BULLET::::- substantial - an attack is a strong possibility
BULLET::::- moderate - an attack is possible but not likely
BULLET::::- low - an attack is unlikely

After "Elmo Makes Music" played for four days at the Everett Events Center in &lt;a href="w%3AEverett%2C%20Washington"&gt;Everett, Washington&lt;/a&gt;, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASesame%20Street%20Live"&gt;Sesame Street Live&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ wrapped up all of its North American dates in its 27th season.

After a three week break, ♡❤Sesame Street Live♡❤ will start the new season in &lt;a href="w%3ARochester%2C%20Minnesota"&gt;Rochester, Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; on August 24.

By far the longest running touring stage show, ♡❤Sesame Street Live♡❤ has played in 19 countries worldwide since its debut in 1980. During the summer, "Super Grover! Ready for Action" will tour &lt;a href="w%3ABangkok"&gt;Bangkok&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMetro%20Manila"&gt;Metro Manila&lt;/a&gt;. The performances star professional dancers in character costumes based on the ever-popular ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASesame%20Street"&gt;Sesame Street&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ &lt;a href="w%3AMuppets"&gt;Muppets&lt;/a&gt;.

Next year VEE Corporation, which runs ♡❤SSL♡❤, will launch a new show: "When Elmo Grows Up". The show's first performance will be in La Crosse, Wisconsin on August 23 this year. "Super Grover! Ready for Action" will become a theatre tour, allowing it to play in cities without an arena large enough for the original production. "Elmo Makes Music" will continue to tour arenas across the continent.

<h1>Lawsuit reveals Bush Administration attempts to suppress dissent</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Lawsuit%20reveals%20Bush%20Administration%20attempts%20to%20suppress%20dissent&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
A manual from the Bush Administration detailing protest suppression tactics has been revealed.

A new lawsuit has been filed against a former high level staffer in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; Presidential Administration of &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;. It was filed by the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union"&gt;American Civil Liberties Union&lt;/a&gt; on behalf of two individuals forcibly removed from a presidential 'Town Hall Meeting', and has brought to light a White House manual detailing tactics aimed at suppressing demonstrations and barring those identifiably opposed to Bush Administration policy access to presidential events.

Leslie Weise, Karen Bauer and Alexander Young, all of Colorado, and often referred to as 'The Denver Three' were ejected from the March 21, 2005 presidential 'Town Hall Meeting' billed as 'A Conversation on Social Security' after it was discovered that their vehicle displayed a bumper sticker reading 'no blood for oil'.

Weise and Young filed an earlier lawsuit against two volunteers at the event for their collaboration with an unidentified man who has been charged with impersonating a &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Secret%20Service"&gt;US Secret Service&lt;/a&gt; agent while ejecting them. This case is now in the hands of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited_States_Department_of_Justice"&gt;Justice Department&lt;/a&gt;.

The 2002 manual titled the 'Presidential Advance Manual' from the 'Office of Presidential Advance' bears the Presidential Seal, and is marked 'sensitive'. Its dissemination was restricted to the ♡❤Executive Office of the President♡❤, ♡❤White House Military Office♡❤ and the ♡❤Secret Service♡❤. A heavily redacted version of the once secret manual was released under the &lt;a href="w%3AFreedom_of_Information_Act_%2528United_States%2529"&gt;Freedom of Information Act&lt;/a&gt;.

The non-redacted parts of the manual detail strategies designed to suppress demonstrations and bar those identifiably opposed to Bush Administration policy access to presidential events.

The manual advises local Republicans, who are charged with filling such events, to form 'Rally Squads' from "college/young republican organizations, local athletic teams, and fraternities/sororities". A section titled ♡❤Preventing Demonstrators♡❤ (sic) directs: "The rally squad's task is to use their signs and banners as shields between the demonstrators and the main press platform. If the demonstrators are yelling, rally squads can begin and lead supportive chants to drown out the protesters (USA! USA! USA!) As a last resort, security should remove the protesters from the event site." Another part urges: "It is important to have your volunteers at a checkpoint before the [Metal Detectors] in order to stop a demonstrator from getting into the event."

Chris Hansen a senior ACLU attorney and lead counsel for the case remarked "The White House has gone too far in its attempt to make dissent invisible," "When taxpayers foot the bill for a public event, the president does not have the right to use a partisan litmus test to stack the audience with his political supporters."

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=America%27s%20Cup%3A%20Alinghi%20one%20race%20away%20from%20winning&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The Switzerland-based yachting team, &lt;a href="w%3AAlinghi"&gt;Alinghi&lt;/a&gt; have defeated &lt;a href="w%3ATeam%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Team New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; to bring their overall wins to four, with New Zealand left on two wins. If Alinghi wins the next race, they will win the "&lt;a href="w%3AAuld%20Mug"&gt;Auld Mug&lt;/a&gt;", which they currently hold.

Alinghi crossed the line 28 seconds before Team New Zealand, despite having winds favourable to Team New Zealand, 8-9 knots.

Yesterday's race was filled with flaws with Team New Zealand having trouble with spinnakers. This race was the opposite, Team New Zealand yachting without flaw, and leading for much of the race. At the first mark, Team New Zealand led by 14 seconds. Though SUI-100, skippered by New Zealander &lt;a href="w%3ABrad%20Butterworth"&gt;Brad Butterworth&lt;/a&gt;, managed to overtake &lt;a href="w%3ANZL-92"&gt;NZL-92&lt;/a&gt;, skippered by &lt;a href="w%3ADean%20Barker"&gt;Dean Barker&lt;/a&gt;, to get a 28 second lead by the end of the race.

During the pre-start race, Team New Zealand crossed in front of the path of Alinghi, leading to a denied appeal by Butterworth. Neither team led the start of the race.

Yachties and sport commentators have labelled the challenge for the &lt;a href="w%3A32nd%20America%27s%20Cup"&gt;32nd America's Cup&lt;/a&gt; the most exciting ever. Defeating the trend of whoever leads the start of the race firsts, wins the race.

Managing director of Team New Zealand, Grant Dalton had previously ruled out crew changes for the next race if such a scenario was to present itself in the future.

The next race, and the possible final race, will be on Sunday.

In 2003, when Team New Zealand was defending the America's Cup in Auckland, New Zealand, Alinghi were the victors, becoming the first European team to win the "Auld Mug".

A wildfire in the &lt;a href="w%3AAshley%20National%20Forest"&gt;Ashley National Forest&lt;/a&gt; has been blamed for three deaths and has led to the evacuation of about 500 residents of the communities of &lt;a href="w%3AWhiterocks"&gt;Whiterocks&lt;/a&gt;, Farm Creek, Paradise and Tridell in eastern &lt;a href="Utah"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt;.

The fire broke out on Friday, June 29 at around 9:00 a.m. local time in &lt;a href="w%3ADuschene%20county"&gt;Duschene county&lt;/a&gt;, north of Neola by state route 121, and proceeded to spread westward into &lt;a href="w%3AUintah%20county"&gt;Uintah county&lt;/a&gt;. 

To date, the cause of the wildfire is unknown. An early report by public safety officials claimed it was caused by a faulty power line or transformer. However, a later announcement by &lt;a href="w%3AMoon%20Lake%20Electric%20Association"&gt;Moon Lake Electric Association&lt;/a&gt; CEO Grant Earl disputed this.

By Saturday morning, the fire had spread across approximately 46 square miles of land and been blamed for three fatalities: George Houston, his son Tracy Houston, and Roger Roberson, all from Farm Creek. Eleven year old Duane Houston, George's grandson, was able to escape the fire with only minor injuries.

The communities of &lt;a href="w%3AWhiterocks"&gt;Whiterocks&lt;/a&gt;, Farm Creek, Paradise and Tridell, consisting of approximately 500 local residents, were evacuated by Sunday, and at least five homes are known to have been destroyed. Those without family or friends to provide lodging have been relocated to the &lt;a href="w%3AUte"&gt;Ute&lt;/a&gt; Indian Tribe's auditorium in &lt;a href="w%3AFort%20Duchesne"&gt;Fort Duchesne&lt;/a&gt; and Union High School in &lt;a href="w%3ARoosevelt%2C%20Utah"&gt;Roosevelt&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Emergency%20Management%20Agency"&gt;Federal Emergency Management Agency&lt;/a&gt; became involved in the management of fire fighting efforts on Sunday, and a specialized regional wildland fire team, the Rocky Mountain Type One Management Team, had begun to converge on the Uinta Basin to assist with the firefighting, along with about 100 members of the Utah National Guard.

Reports that same day claimed the fire was 5% contained, but that it had split into at least two separate smaller fires. Authorities declared their intention to prevent the fire from moving eastwards into Dry Fork Canyon and the town of Tridell.

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George Bush&lt;/a&gt; yesterday lost the power to unilaterally approve or 'fast-track' trade deals, bypassing congressional approval. Fast-track authority originated in 1975 during the Ford Administration. President Bush and Bill Clinton are the only presidents to lose this authority.

On Friday, &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;Democratic members&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Ways%20and%20Means"&gt;Ways and Means committee&lt;/a&gt; stated that their priorities "do not include the renewal of fast track authority" and complained that Bush had "pushed too many trade deals through at the expense of worker rights and environmental protections" and costing American jobs.

Administration official Susan Schwab urged renewal of this presidential authority warning that the United States could lose the race to exploit new markets without it. The Bush Administration has approved trade deals, without congressional oversight, with &lt;a href="Singapore"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Chile"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Morocco"&gt;Morocco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Bahrain"&gt;Bahrain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Oman"&gt;Oman&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="Dominican%20Republic"&gt;Dominican Republic&lt;/a&gt;, and the Central America Union, since winning approval in 2002. 

Democrats have complained that these deals have resulted in the export of American jobs and in American companies moving off-shore to capitalize on tax and trade breaks, along with weaker labor and environmental laws. Republicans stress the market-opening benefits of such trade deals.

Younger &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;Americans&lt;/a&gt; may be more receptive to traditionally liberal social policy than their parents, according to a recent poll conducted by the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Times"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACBS%20News%2C"&gt;CBS News,&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMTV"&gt;MTV&lt;/a&gt;. The survey found those ages 17 to 29 to be substantially more interested in Presidential politics, with nearly 60 percent expressing interest in the 2008 race, compared to 35 percent at approximately the same point in the 2004 campaign.

&lt;a href="w%3ASingle-payer_health_care"&gt;Government-sponsored health&lt;/a&gt; care received strong support among the younger voters polled, at 62 percent, compared with just 47 percent support across voters of all ages. Younger voters appear more supportive of same-sex marriage, legalization of marijuana, and liberalized immigration policy as well. 

Optimism about the outcome of the war in Iraq was higher among the young, with 51 percent of those surveyed predicting a successful outcome, although 87 percent opposed the institution of a draft. Among all adults, 45 percent envision a successful outcome of the war. 

In stark contrast, younger Americans expressed a generally pessimistic attitude about their future personally and the direction of the country in general. Nearly half predict that they will not enjoy the same success as their parents, and 70 percent felt that the country was on the wrong track.

Despite differences on social policy, some similarities emerged in the poll. Survey data indicated that just 28 percent of those polled approved of the Bush administration's performance, which is fairly consistent with other polls of the President's performance, hovering around 30 percent. Support for abortion was also similar between youth and voters in general.

A majority of younger voters indicated that they would vote for a Democrat for President in 2008, reflecting previous trends. Voter turnout among the young has historically lagged turnout rates for all adults, although 2004 saw sharp increases in young voter participation. That year, 47 percent of 18 to 24-year-olds voted, compared with 36 percent in the 2000 election. A majority of the young have cast votes for the Democratic nominee in every Presidential race since 1992.

The poll surveyed 659 participants via telephone in mid-June, and has a margin of error of four percent.

<h1>Smoking ban in England comes into force</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Smoking%20ban%20in%20England%20comes%20into%20force&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A ban on smoking in enclosed public places in &lt;a href="w%3AEngland"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; is in effect as of 0600 &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Summer%20Time"&gt;BST&lt;/a&gt; today, bringing the country into line with similar laws already introduced in other parts of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. 

The aims of the ban are to reduce the risks associated with &lt;a href="w%3Apassive%20smoking"&gt;passive smoking&lt;/a&gt; and to reduce the number of smokers overall. The government estimates that 600,000 of the 10 million smokers in Britain will give up as a result.

Health Secretary &lt;a href="w%3AAlan%20Johnson"&gt;Alan Johnson&lt;/a&gt; welcomes the ban, saying that "A smoke-free country will improve the health of thousands of people, reduce the temptation to smoke, and encourage smokers to quit."

The ban is not being welcomed by all citizens, however. Activist group Freedom To Choose is challenging the law at the &lt;a href="w%3AHigh%20Court%20of%20Justice"&gt;High Court&lt;/a&gt; saying it is in violation of the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Convention%20on%20Human%20Rights"&gt;European Convention on Human Rights&lt;/a&gt;.

The business community is expressing concerns about the impact on &lt;a href="w%3Apub"&gt;pubs&lt;/a&gt; and similar establishments. Research by &lt;a href="w%3ANielsen%20Company"&gt;Nielsen&lt;/a&gt; estimates that the sale of &lt;a href="w%3Abeer"&gt;beer&lt;/a&gt; in England and &lt;a href="w%3AWales"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt; could fall by 200 million pints yearly. However, a survey by the &lt;a href="w%3ACampaign%20for%20Real%20Ale"&gt;Campaign for Real Ale&lt;/a&gt; suggests 840,000 people who do not regularly go to the pub would do so following the introduction of the ban and that England's 6.2 million regular drinkers would be more likely to visit pubs and bars. 

Smoking kills 100,000 people in Britain each year through cancer, lung conditions, and heart problems. Approximately 1,000 people a day in England are admitted to hospital with an illness related to smoking, costing the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Health%20Service"&gt;National Health Service&lt;/a&gt; an estimated £1.5 billion.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEngland%20cricket%20team"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have beaten &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Indies%20cricket%20team"&gt;West Indies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by 79 runs in the first &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOne-Day%20International"&gt;One-Day International&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Indian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%202007"&gt;West Indies tour of England&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALord%27s%20Cricket%20Ground"&gt;Lord's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEngland"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , giving &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Collingwood"&gt;Paul Collingwood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; victory in his first match as England's one-day captain.

England started their innings slowly, scoring just 26 runs off the first 10 overs. Although &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIan%20Bell%20%28cricketer%29"&gt;Ian Bell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; hit 56 runs, the England batsmen struggled, restricted to 255 by the West Indies bowling attack with just 12 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABoundary%20%28cricket%29"&gt;boundaries&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; being scored and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFidel%20Edwards"&gt;Fidel Edwards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; taking five wickets.

In reply, West Indies had a disastrous start losing four wickets for just thirteen runs. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AShivnarine%20Chanderpaul"&gt;Shivnarine Chanderpaul&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; scored 53 not out, and shared a 61 run partnership with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADwayne%20Bravo"&gt;Dwayne Bravo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (29). However &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Anderson"&gt;James Anderson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , taking two wickets in two balls, and wickets from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStuart%20Broad"&gt;Stuart Broad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (3-20) and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALiam%20Plunkett"&gt;Liam Plunkett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (2-38) reduced West Indies to 146 all out.

Play was suspended for about fifty minutes after 42.4 overs of the England innings due to rain, with England at 181-4.

This is the first ODI in a three match series, with the others due to take place at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEdgbaston%20Cricket%20Ground"&gt;Edgbaston&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on 4th July and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATrent%20Bridge"&gt;Trent Bridge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on 7th July. England lead the series 1-0.

Previously on the tour, England won a four match &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATest%20cricket"&gt;Test&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; series 3-0 and drew the two match &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATwenty20"&gt;Twenty20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; series 1-1.

On July 1, 2007 &lt;a href="w%3AGlasgow%20International%20Airport"&gt;Glasgow International Airport&lt;/a&gt; began to reopen after a &lt;a href="Car%20driven%20into%20Glasgow%20International%20Airport"&gt;car was driven into the airport by terrorists&lt;/a&gt;, with flights from &lt;a href="Orlando"&gt;Orlando&lt;/a&gt; and Ibiza arriving during the day. By the end of the day, the airport was reported to be operating largely as usual, but passengers continued to be advised to confirm their flights with operators before coming to the airport. Tight security precautions remain in force across UK airports today, although most flights are operating as normal.

Several houses have been searched in the area of &lt;a href="w%3ARenfrewshire"&gt;Renfrewshire&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ANeuk%20Crescent"&gt;Neuk Crescent&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHouston%2C%20Scotland"&gt;Houston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Scotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;. Five arrests have been made following the incident in Glasgow: two in &lt;a href="Glasgow"&gt;Glasgow&lt;/a&gt;, Scotland, two on the &lt;a href="w%3AM6%20motorway"&gt;M6 motorway&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ACheshire"&gt;Cheshire&lt;/a&gt;, and one in &lt;a href="Liverpool"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;). The police are continuing house searches and inquiries throughout the country, including in &lt;a href="w%3AMerseyside"&gt;Merseyside&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AStaffordshire"&gt;Staffordshire&lt;/a&gt;, with one suspect identified to "still be at large".

Sky News reports that two of the arrested men are doctors, working in British hospitals. 

A suspicious car has undergone a &lt;a href="w%3AControlled%20explosion"&gt;controlled explosion&lt;/a&gt; outside the &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Alexandra%20Hospital%20%28Paisley%29"&gt;Royal Alexandra Hospital&lt;/a&gt;, to which a suspect of the attack at the airport had been taken for treatment as a result of burns. A 200 m cordon was set up around the hospital as a precautionary measure, with ambulances being turned away from the &lt;a href="w%3AEmergency%20department"&gt;accident and emergency department&lt;/a&gt;. Police have stated that they believe that the suspicious vehicle was connected to the earlier attack at Glasgow International Airport, but that they do not believe it to have contained any explosives. 

During a press conference &lt;a href="w%3AStrathclyde%20police"&gt;Strathclyde police&lt;/a&gt; revealed that they believe the two men had been living in &lt;a href="w%3ARenfrew"&gt;Renfrew&lt;/a&gt; for at least six weeks prior to the attacks of yesterday. The green Cherokee jeep is "possibly" a second hand, rather than stolen, car with &lt;a href="w%3AVehicle%20registration%20plate"&gt;registration&lt;/a&gt; L808 RDT. Questions were raised during the conference concerning whether the &lt;a href="USA"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt; had, as had been reported in certain circles, published a report predicting that there may be an attack on Glasgow Airport. This was not confirmed and considered as speculation. The police issued an appeal for any details about sightings of the vehicle prior to the event.

His teammate &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFelipe%20Massa"&gt;Felipe Massa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , starting from pole, was unable to hold back Kimi and finished second.

His teammate &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFernando%20Alonso"&gt;Fernando Alonso&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who started in the 10th position, suffered a gearbox problem in Q3 but managed to climb to 7th place on the back of his former &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARenault%20F1"&gt;Renault&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; teammate &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGiancarlo%20Fisicella"&gt;Giancarlo Fisicella&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The &lt;a href="w%3AOne-Day%20International"&gt;One-Day International&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACricket"&gt;cricket&lt;/a&gt; match between &lt;a href="w%3APakistan%20national%20cricket%20team"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AScotland%20national%20cricket%20team"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Grange%2C%20Edinburgh%20%28cricket%20and%20sports%20club%29"&gt;Grange Cricket Club Ground&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AEdinburgh"&gt;Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Scotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; was called off due to rain.

Due to a waterlogged field caused by overnight rain, and a poor weather forecast for the rest of the day, the match was first delayed from a 10:45 &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20European%20Summer%20Time"&gt;BST&lt;/a&gt; start and then abandoned after a pitch inspection at 12:00.

Roddy Smith, chief executive of &lt;a href="w%3ACricket%20Scotland"&gt;Cricket Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, said "It's disappointing to lose the chance to play against a &lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20International%20Cricket%20Council%20members%23Full%20Members"&gt;full member&lt;/a&gt; country".

Scotland is an &lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20International%20Cricket%20Council%20members%23Associate%20Members"&gt;associate member&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Cricket%20Council"&gt;ICC&lt;/a&gt;, awarded ODI status until 2009 by qualifying for the semi-finals of the &lt;a href="w%3A2005%20ICC%20Trophy"&gt;2005 ICC Trophy&lt;/a&gt;.

The match was the only ODI that Pakistan would have played against the hosts in the brief tour. Pakistan will play an ODI against &lt;a href="w%3AIndia%20national%20cricket%20team"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3AClydesdale%20Cricket%20Club"&gt;Titwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGlasgow"&gt;Glasgow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AScotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, while Scotland will play an ODI against India in August during the latter's &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%202007"&gt;tour of England&lt;/a&gt;.

In 2005, an ODI between Scotland and &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia%20national%20cricket%20team"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; was also abandoned because of rain.

In the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Future%20Cup"&gt;2007 Future Cup&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20cricket%20team"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; have beaten &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20African%20cricket%20team"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; by six wickets in the third and final &lt;a href="w%3AOne-Day%20International"&gt;One-Day International&lt;/a&gt; (ODI) held at the &lt;a href="w%3ACivil%20Service%20Cricket%20Club"&gt;Civil Service Cricket Club Ground&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AStormont"&gt;Stormont&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABelfast"&gt;Belfast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Ireland"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. India win the three match series 2-1.

South Africa's batting order collapsed to 28-4, but 56 from &lt;a href="w%3AHerschelle%20Gibbs"&gt;Herschelle Gibbs&lt;/a&gt; and 61 from &lt;a href="w%3AJustin%20Kemp"&gt;Justin Kemp&lt;/a&gt; rescued a score of 148 for them.

In reply, India were reduced to 35-3. However &lt;a href="w%3AYuvraj%20Singh"&gt;Yuvraj Singh&lt;/a&gt; posted a score of 61 not out and India reached the target with four balls remaining.

The match was reduced to 31 overs per side due to damp weather conditions.

A young woman was killed Friday night after an accident occurred on a gyrating ride at the &lt;a href="w%3APlayland%20%28New%20York%29"&gt;Playland&lt;/a&gt; amusement park in &lt;a href="w%3ARye%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Rye, New York&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. The woman, Gabriela Garin, was a worker at the amusement park, and had worked there for the past seven years. 

The accident occurred near the end of Garin's shift; as she was loading riders onto the ride. The ride's new operator, unaware of Garin's presence, started the ride while Garin was still on it. The new operator then noticed Garin, and shut the ride down in 20 seconds, but Garin had already been ejected from the ride and killed, according to a park spokesperson. 

The ride is an attraction that spins people around in two-seat cars, inside a darkened tent to flashing lights and music. 

This incident is not the first in the ride's history. In 2004, a seven-year-old from Connecticut managed to free herself from the ride's restraining bars, and climb onto the front edge of her seat. She fell soon after the ride started. A safety precaution was put in place after this incident, however, the spokesperson acknowledged that it was not followed when Garin was killed.

The company which owns the ride shut it down, along with two other rides it owns at the park. 

This is the fourth fatality in the park's history. The park features more than 50 rides, a pool, and a beach. It attracts more than 1 million visitors annually.

According to reports, a terminal at &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20F.%20Kennedy%20International%20Airport"&gt;John F. Kennedy International Airport&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%2C%20New%20York"&gt;New York, New York&lt;/a&gt; was evacuated after authorities found a suspicious package outside the main &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Airlines"&gt;American Airlines&lt;/a&gt; terminal.

Reports say that the package was found outside the terminal on a street curb just before 10:30 a.m. (eastern time), and turned out to be men's cologne.

"There was a suspicious package that was found at 10:20 a.m. curbside at Terminal 9, which is American Airlines. It turned out to be a package containing cologne," said Steve Coleman, a spokesman for American Airlines.

At approximately 11:35 a.m. (eastern time) authorities began to let passengers back into the terminal, giving it the all clear.

No flights were affected by the incident.

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; had raised the presence of police and bomb sniffing dogs at airports across the U.S. after a terrorist attack in &lt;a href="w%3AGlasgow"&gt;Glasgow, Scotland&lt;/a&gt;.

An estimated 200,000 iPhones were sold in the US in the first few days of release. Over 400 of those have been put up for sale on the online auction site eBay, by individuals hoping to profit from the demand.

Trip Chowdhry, an analyst with San Francisco-based Global Equities, estimated Apple stores sold about 128,000 on the first day, while AT&amp;T stores sold about 72,000.

The pre-release frenzy that preceded the coming of the iPhone was climaxed by hundreds of people camping outside many Apple stores across the United States.

The iPhone acts as a mobile phone, MP3 player, and wireless web browser/email client.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Leahy"&gt;Patrick Leahy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;D&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVermont"&gt;VT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ), chairman of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Judiciary Committee, remarked today that &lt;a href="US%20Congress"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt; was ready to go to court if the White House continues to refuse to comply with subpoenas for information regarding the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADismissal%20of%20U.S.%20attorneys%20controversy"&gt;firing of federal prosecutors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Leahy said that the committee could seek to charge the &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush&lt;/a&gt; Administration with criminal contempt of Congress if it did not provide public testimony in the matter.

"They’ve chosen confrontation rather than compromise or cooperation," said Leahy on the '&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMeet%20the%20Press"&gt;Meet the Press&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ' news program. "The bottom line is in the U.S. attorney investigation, we have people manipulating law enforcement. Law enforcement can’t be partisan." 

The investigation questions whether the White House illegally exerted undue political influence in the firing of 8 federal prosecutors. The Democratic-led investigation could result in a Constitutional showdown over issues of executive privilege and congressional oversight.

The Senate has also subpoenaed the White House and Vice President &lt;a href="Dick%20Cheney"&gt;Dick Cheney&lt;/a&gt;’s office for documents related to the administration’s &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANSA%20warrantless%20surveillance%20controversy"&gt;'Warrantless Wiretapping'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; within the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. In this case, lawyers for Vice President Cheney first argued that the Vice President's role in the Senate meant that Cheney wasn't part of the Executive Branch. This legal claim generated substantial criticism and a failed attempt to get funding for Cheney's executive role cut off. White House lawyer David Addington and others in the administration have since backed away from this argument. 

A number of procedural matters remain before criminal contempt proceedings can begin. The committee must formally reject claims of executive privilege and then must vote to find the President in contempt of Congress. Such a vote must be confirmed by the whole Senate before being sent to a U.S. attorney, who must also concur before a formal charge can be established. The House of Representatives may also bring contempt charges independent of the Senate if it so chooses. Such charges are rarely brought by either body of Congress: just ten cases since 1975, and most result in settlement agreements prior to the commencement of a trial.

Performances by &lt;a href="w%3AElton%20John"&gt;Sir Elton John&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AEnglish%20National%20Ballet"&gt;English National Ballet&lt;/a&gt; featured in the &lt;a href="w%3AConcert%20for%20Diana"&gt;Concert for Diana&lt;/a&gt;, held in &lt;a href="w%3AWembley%20Stadium"&gt;Wembley Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday to commemorate the late &lt;a href="w%3ADiana%2C%20Princess%20of%20Wales"&gt;Diana, Princess of Wales&lt;/a&gt; life on what would have been her 46th birthday. 

As a result of the terror attacks in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; on the days prior to the event, heightened security precautions were in force, with a high police presence around the venue, and bag searches taking place. Despite the security fears, over 63,000 attended the concert. It was televised to 120 countries around the world, with a potential audience of 500 million.

The concert, broadcast by &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;the BBC&lt;/a&gt;, featured acts from many groups and individuals including Sir Elton John, and the English National Ballet. It was hosted by Princes &lt;a href="w%3APrince%20William"&gt;William&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APrince%20Harry"&gt;Harry&lt;/a&gt; and opened and closed by Sir Elton John, who is remembered for having played a unique rendition of &lt;a href="w%3ACandle%20in%20the%20Wind"&gt;Candle in the Wind&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3ADeath_of_Diana%252C_Princess_of_Wales%23Funeral_and_public_reaction"&gt;Princess' funeral&lt;/a&gt;. 

Performances were interspersed with tributes from various public figures including &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt;, the former &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom"&gt;Prime Minister of the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ANelson%20Mandela"&gt;Nelson Mandela&lt;/a&gt;, the former President of &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;. Films showing parts of Diana's life, with testimony from those who worked with her, were also aired, publicising the Princess' work around the world, which was to be supported by profits from the concert.

The seventh race in the challenge for the 32nd &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAmerica%27s%20Cup"&gt;America's Cup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has been postponed due to unfair and unstable race conditions. This race could have been the last and final race as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAlinghi"&gt;Alinghi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are currently on match point on four wins, while &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATeam%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Team New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are only on two wins in the best of nine competition.

At 12.30 a.m. (NZST) there was already speculation gathering that there could be a delay due to the wind being all over the place. The principal race officer also confirmed that there was a very real possibility that there would be a delay.

The delayed flag was flown at 12.55 a.m., five minutes before the yachting race was due to begin. This was due to unstable weather conditions, which could lead to an unfair race.

At 1.20 a.m., 20 minutes after the race was scheduled to start, there had still been no word from the race committee on a possible racing time. The wind speeds were around five knots near the starting line, but the wind direction still wasn't stable and fair.

The wind speed was starting to get higher into more acceptable conditions with the wind at the start line around seven knots. But the wind direction was still unstable.

At 2.10 a.m., the principal race officer announced that there would be "no more racing today". Tomorrow is a guaranteed rest day, so the next possible day for racing will be early Wednesday morning (NZST).

During this America's Cup challenge and other previous ones, discussion has been raised that a new boat design is needed, as to make the race more interesting with faster boats and more takeovers throughout the race.

It was also Grant Dalton's, managing director of Team New Zealand, 50th birthday.

The visit of Chavez to &lt;a href="w%3ATehran"&gt;Tehran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;, followed earlier ones to Russia and Belarus. Iran's state-run television reported that Hugo Chavez stated to Khamenei that Iran was an apt model for other nations to emulate.

Chavez said that the two nations' ties in the petroleum, gasoline, and petrochemical sectors will be expanded. 

In a reference to the recent political development in various parts of &lt;a href="w%3ALatin%20America"&gt;Latin America&lt;/a&gt; where anti-American leaders have attained political control, Chavez said, "U.S. imperialism is declining, and independent countries are viewing the future with hope and optimism."

Both Venezuela and Iran are members of &lt;a href="w%3AOPEC"&gt;OPEC&lt;/a&gt;. 

Last month, &lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Ortega"&gt;Daniel Ortega&lt;/a&gt;, the president of &lt;a href="Nicaragua"&gt;Nicaragua&lt;/a&gt;, came to Iran. In the following months, &lt;a href="w%3AEvo%20Morales"&gt;Evo Morales&lt;/a&gt;, the president of &lt;a href="Bolivia"&gt;Bolivia&lt;/a&gt;, is expected in Tehran.

Police have arrested three more men in connection with the failed terror attacks of the past few days on London and Glasgow bringing the total number of arrests to eight.

&lt;a href="w%3ASky%20News"&gt;Sky News&lt;/a&gt; has revealed the identity of one of the practising doctors arrested yesterday as Dr Mohammed Asha, who trained in &lt;a href="w%3AJordan"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt; before coming to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; to practise. Police are continuing house raids throughout the country, in &lt;a href="w%3APaisley"&gt;Paisley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMerseyside"&gt;Merseyside&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AStaffordshire"&gt;Staffordshire&lt;/a&gt;. One suspect, badly burned after the attack on Glasgow airport, is currently receiving treatment at the &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Alexandra%20Hospital%20%28Paisley%29"&gt;Royal Alexandra Hospital&lt;/a&gt;.

The eighth suspect was arrested abroad this evening, but police are refusing to reveal details of the country in which the arrest took place. It has been revealed that five of those arrested are qualified doctors, practising in the UK, three of those in the Royal Alexandra Hospital. 
The UK's terror threat warning level remains ♡❤"critical"♡❤, meaning that an attack could be ♡❤imminent♡❤. Heavy security is in evidence at airports and public transport centres, with many airports asking passengers not to bring vehicles close to the terminal buildings. This evening, at around 1900 BST, &lt;a href="w%3AStansted%20Airport"&gt;Stansted Airport&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AEssex"&gt;Essex&lt;/a&gt;. was closed for a short time following the discovery of a suspicious bag. The owner of the bag was arrested while the airport closed its doors, not allowing passengers into or out of it. The &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; reports that, by 2035, the airport had been fully re-opened. The owner of the bag remains under arrest, but not for terrorism related offences.

&lt;a href="w%3AStrathclyde%20Police"&gt;Strathclyde Police&lt;/a&gt; is continuing its appeal for any details of earlier movements of the green &lt;a href="w%3AJeep%20Cherokee%20%28XJ%29"&gt;Jeep Cherokee&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="w%3AVehicle%20registration%20plate"&gt;registration&lt;/a&gt; L808 RDT, which was driven into the terminal building at &lt;a href="w%3AGlasgow%20International%20Airport"&gt;Glasgow International Airport&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3AMetropolitan%20Police"&gt;Metropolitan Police&lt;/a&gt; has now taken over the inquiry, with suspects held in Scotland to be moved to London.

The Citizen's Committee for the Free Beach (♡❤Comitato Civico per la Spiaggia Libera♡❤) of &lt;a href="w%3AMaiori"&gt;Maiori&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, collected signatures on July 1, 2007 in order to defend the right of its citizens to have a free beach. On Sunday morning alone approximately 250 signatures were collected.

One part of the beach has additional services, where people have to pay for sunshades and sun loungers. This side is also less crowded than the part without services. Fees amount to &lt;a href="w%3AEuro"&gt;€&lt;/a&gt;20 for a sunshade and two sun loungers, with residents of Maiori paying €8. The committee contends that this is prohibitively expensive for working families and those on fixed income. As a town near the beach, most people work in the tourism industry and earn most of their living during the summer season. 

Two &lt;a href="w%3ALido%20%28swimming%20pool%29"&gt;lido&lt;/a&gt; areas are also installed along the shore. The administrators of one of the two lidos try to inhibit people who don't pay for additional services from using the public stairs to access the beach. The Committee protests that they forbid people who want to go swimming to sit on the beach near the water, although it is their legal rights. Italian law states that the shore line is public property.

Additional acts of protest events are planned for Saturday and Sunday.

&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Moore"&gt;Michael Moore&lt;/a&gt;'s controversial new &lt;a href="w%3ADocumentary%20film"&gt;documentary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASiCKO"&gt;SiCKO&lt;/a&gt; opened to strong box office numbers in limited release over the weekend. The biting and sometimes humorous expose of America's health system earned weekend totals of &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;4.5 Million on 441 screens, the second highest opening weekend numbers for a documentary ever, after Moore's own &lt;a href="w%3AFahrenheit%209/11"&gt;Fahrenheit 9/11&lt;/a&gt;.

This follows last weekend's 'sneak preview' screenings of the film in 43 major markets. ♡❤Fox News♡❤ reports that all of these screenings were sold out. The latest documentary from &lt;a href="w%3AAcademy%20Award"&gt;Academy Award&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACannes%20Film%20Festival"&gt;Cannes Film Festival&lt;/a&gt; winning filmmaker Moore earned US$10,200 per screen, second in the weekend averages, and ninth in total sales. &lt;a href="w%3ARatatouille%20%28film%29"&gt;Ratatouille&lt;/a&gt; was the weekend's number one film with US$11,935 per screen (3940 screens) and top earnings of $47 Million. After only one weekend's limited release, SiCKO is now the fifth most successful political documentary ever, behind Fahrenheit 9/11, Al Gore's &lt;a href="w%3AAn%20Inconvenient%20Truth"&gt;An Inconvenient Truth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABowling%20for%20Columbine"&gt;Bowling for Columbine&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ARoger%20and%20Me"&gt;Roger and Me&lt;/a&gt;. Four of the top five are now by documentarian Moore.

SiCKO first opened at the &lt;a href="w%3AAMC%20Theatres"&gt;AMC Lincoln Square&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AFox%20News%20Channel"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt; reported that the first screening's take was "possibly a record for an exclusive showing." Moore attended one of the &lt;a href="w%3ALincoln%20Square%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Lincoln Square&lt;/a&gt; screenings; his presence not known until he revealed himself during the standing ovation that the film garnered. The ensuing melee of enthusiastic fans resulted in a NYC fire marshal being called in to clear the theater, with Moore then participating in an informal question and answer session on the street.

Moore has appeared on numerous talk shows in support of the film, which &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Weinstein%20Company"&gt;The Weinstein Company&lt;/a&gt; will roll out to 200 more theaters this week.

Libby is the former chief of staff for U.S. Vice President &lt;a href="Dick%20Cheney"&gt;Dick Cheney&lt;/a&gt;, and was at the center of the CIA leak scandal, where the identity of former &lt;a href="CIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; agent &lt;a href="w%3AValerie%20Plame"&gt;Valerie Plame&lt;/a&gt; was allegedly leaked to the media by &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; officials. 

Bush's intervention ensures that Libby will not serve jail time, however Libby must still pay a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;250,000 fine and undergo two years of probation. In a statement, Bush said, "I respect the jury's verdict. But I have concluded that the prison sentence given to Mr. Libby is excessive. Therefore, I am commuting the portion of Mr. Libby's sentence that required him to spend thirty months in prison."

He continued, "My decision to commute his prison sentence leaves in place a harsh punishment for Mr. Libby. The reputation he gained through his years of public service and professional work in the legal community is forever damaged. His wife and young children have also suffered immensely. He will remain on probation. The significant fines imposed by the judge will remain in effect. The consequences of his felony conviction on his former life as a lawyer, public servant, and private citizen will be long-lasting."

A federal court convicted Libby of perjury and obstruction of justice on March 6, 2007, and sentenced him to 2 1/2 years in prison. Bush issued the order to commute Libby's prison term after a federal appeals court ruled that Libby could not delay his prison term while his case was on appeal. 

Article II, Section 2 of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Constitution"&gt;United States Constitution&lt;/a&gt; grants the President authority to fully or partially commute the sentences of those convicted in federal courts, however acceptance of a pardon also requires the party to admit guilt in the matter.

Reports say that authorities in &lt;a href="w%3ABrisbane"&gt;Brisbane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; have arrested an individual connected with the failed &lt;a href="w%3AGlasgow"&gt;Glasgow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%2C%20England"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; bombings in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; on June 29 and June 30. Australian media reports that the man was arrested at &lt;a href="w%3ABrisbane%20Airport"&gt;Brisbane International Airport&lt;/a&gt; yesterday at 11:00 p.m. (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC%2B10"&gt;UTC+10&lt;/a&gt;).

The man has since be named as Mohammed Haneef and Australian Attorney-General Philip Ruddock says that Haneef is cooperating with authorities and has not been charged with any crime as of yet.

Police in the U.K. confirm that the arrest has been made saying, "he remains in custody."

"Yes there was an arrest last night but I will stress at no stage was there any threat to the Brisbane Airport," said Jim Carden, a spokesman for the airport.

Mohammed Haneef is being described as a 27 year-old male who is a qualified medical doctor and reports say that he was leaving the airport and had a one-way ticket to &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;.

Haneef is employed at the Gold Coast Hospital in &lt;a href="w%3AQueensland"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt;. Haneef is not an Australian citizen. It is reported that Haneef is from &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;.

A total of eight suspects have been arrested, six of which are doctors or studying to be doctors.

The terror threat level in the UK remains ♡❤critical♡❤, indicating that an attack could be expected imminently and high security is in evidence on mass transport routes, while the police continue their investigations.

Earlier this morning, a &lt;a href="w%3Acontrolled%20explosion"&gt;controlled explosion&lt;/a&gt; took place on a suspicious package discovered outside &lt;a href="w%3AHammersmith%20tube%20station"&gt;Hammersmith Station&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Underground"&gt;London Underground&lt;/a&gt; system. The scare led to the closure of Hammersmith and &lt;a href="w%3ABarons%20Court"&gt;Barons Court&lt;/a&gt; stations for one hour. 

Two other stations, &lt;a href="w%3ATower%20Hill%20tube%20station"&gt;Tower Hill&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Ham%20tube%20station"&gt;East Ham&lt;/a&gt;, were closed in similar circumstances. All four stations have now been reopened.

Soprano &lt;a href="w%3ABeverly%20Sills"&gt;Beverly Sills&lt;/a&gt;, who brought opera to &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; popular culture through frequent television appearances, died last night at her home in &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;. She was 78.
Born Belle Miriam Silverman on May 25, 1929 in Brooklyn, she was nicknamed "Bubbles", and started singing at age three, winning talent contests and singing on the radio.

She made her professional stage debut in 1945, with a touring &lt;a href="w%3AGilbert%20and%20Sullivan"&gt;Gilbert and Sullivan&lt;/a&gt; show, and in 1947, started singing opera as Frasquite in ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACarmen"&gt;Carmen&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ with the Philadelphia City Opera. She sang with the &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco%20Opera"&gt;San Francisco Opera&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City%20Opera"&gt;New York City Opera&lt;/a&gt;.

She married in 1956 to journalist and ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACleveland%20Plain%20Dealer"&gt;Cleveland Plain Dealer&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ publishing heir &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Greenough"&gt;Peter Greenough&lt;/a&gt;, and had two children with him. One was deaf and the other mentally retarded, so Sills curtailed her performances to care for them.

She returned to opera in 1962, with the &lt;a href="w%3AOpera%20Company%20of%20Boston"&gt;Opera Company of Boston&lt;/a&gt;, and then reached her peak singing years in the mid- and late-1960s, singing with the New York City Opera.

She made her debut with the &lt;a href="w%3AMetropolitan%20Opera"&gt;Metropolitan Opera&lt;/a&gt; in April 1975, receiving an 18-minute ovation for her performance in ♡❤The Siege of Corinth♡❤.

At the height of her popularity in the 1970s, she was a regular guest on television variety shows with &lt;a href="w%3ADanny%20Kaye"&gt;Danny Kaye&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACarol%20Burnett"&gt;Carol Burnett&lt;/a&gt; and ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Muppet%20Show"&gt;The Muppet Show&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. She was even a guest host on &lt;a href="w%3AJohnny%20Carson"&gt;Johnny Carson&lt;/a&gt;'s ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Tonight%20Show"&gt;The Tonight Show&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. For two years, she had her own weekly talk show. Sills graced magazine covers, such as ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ATime%20%28magazine%29"&gt;Time&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANewsweek"&gt;Newsweek&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, as an example of an American who conquered the European-dominated world of &lt;a href="w%3AClassical%20music"&gt;classical music&lt;/a&gt;.

After retiring from performing in 1980, Sills became the general manager of the New York City Opera. She became the chairman of &lt;a href="w%3ALincoln%20Center%20for%20the%20Performing%20Arts"&gt;Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts&lt;/a&gt; in 1994, and 2002 was appointed head of the Metropolitan Opera.

Sills had surgery for cancer in 1974, but it had been revealed last month that she was ill with an aggressive form of lung cancer, though she never smoked. She died about 9 p.m. ET yesterday at her home in Manhattan with her family and doctor at her side.

<h1>New Ghanaian currency introduced</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=New%20Ghanaian%20currency%20introduced&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

New currency notes are being introduced in &lt;a href="Ghana"&gt;Ghana&lt;/a&gt; today. The new currency, to be called the &lt;a href="w%3AGhanaian%20cedi"&gt;Ghanaian cedi&lt;/a&gt;, replaces the previous &lt;a href="w%3Acedi"&gt;cedi&lt;/a&gt; which has been in circulation since 17 February, 1967. 

The Ghanaian cedi will be exchanged at 10,000 old cedis to one new Ghanaian cedi. The exchange rate against the U.S. dollar starts at GH¢0.92 to one U.S. dollar. The new &lt;a href="w%3AISO%204217%20Code"&gt;ISO code&lt;/a&gt; for the currency is GHS, and the new symbol, GH¢.

The change, which was originally scheduled by the &lt;a href="w%3ABank%20of%20Ghana"&gt;Bank of Ghana&lt;/a&gt; to start on July 1, 2007, will instead start on Tuesday July 3, as the original date is Ghana's &lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20Day"&gt;Republic Day&lt;/a&gt;. 

Monday, July 2, was declared a public holiday as the actual Republic Day fell on a Sunday. July 3, is thus the first day that the currency will be available to the public as banks open to the general public. This is because &lt;a href="w%3AAutomated%20teller%20machine"&gt;ATM&lt;/a&gt;s were shut down over the weekend so that the currencies could be checked and replaced in all of them nationwide. The old and new currencies will be used concurrently until the end of December 2007, when the old currency will cease to be legal tender. 

This is the third Ghanaian cedi to be introduced in the country since 1965.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Controlled%20explosions%20take%20place%20as%20police%20enquiry%20into%20UK%20bombings%20continues&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A suspicious bag has undergone a controlled explosion outside a &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Underground"&gt;London Underground&lt;/a&gt; station, as has a car outside a &lt;a href="w%3Amosque"&gt;mosque&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AGlasgow"&gt;Glasgow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AScotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;.

These police actions come in the wake of failed terror attacks involving car bombs in &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; and at &lt;a href="w%3AGlasgow%20International%20Airport"&gt;Glasgow International Airport&lt;/a&gt; on 29th and 30th June. 

The terror threat level in the UK remains ♡❤critical♡❤, indicating that an attack could be expected imminently and high security is in evidence on mass transport routes, while the police continue their investigations. Earlier this morning, a &lt;a href="w%3Acontrolled%20explosion"&gt;controlled explosion&lt;/a&gt; took place on a suspicious package discovered outside &lt;a href="w%3AHammersmith%20tube%20station"&gt;Hammersmith Station&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Underground"&gt;London Underground&lt;/a&gt; system. The scare led to the closure of Hammersmith and &lt;a href="w%3ABarons%20Court"&gt;Barons Court&lt;/a&gt; stations for one hour. 

Two other stations, &lt;a href="w%3ATower%20Hill%20tube%20station"&gt;Tower Hill&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Ham%20tube%20station"&gt;East Ham&lt;/a&gt;, were closed in similar circumstances. All four stations have now been reopened.

Sky news reports that three controlled explosions took place on a car outside a mosque in Glasgow, in order to allow police to gain entry to it. The mosque itself is not being linked to the terror attacks.

&lt;a href="w%3AMuslim%20Council%20of%20Britain"&gt;The Muslim Council of Britain&lt;/a&gt; has condemned the attacks, and has urged &lt;a href="w%3AMuslim"&gt;Muslims&lt;/a&gt; throughout the country to assist in police investigations.

The &lt;a href="w%3AMetropolitan%20Police"&gt;police force&lt;/a&gt; is continuing its investigations throughout the country, with an open appeal to the country for vigilance in reporting anything suspicious.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Hempleman-Adams"&gt;David Hempleman-Adams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; left St. John's at approximately 9:30 p.m. local time on July 2, 2007 from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20John%27s%2C%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador"&gt;St. John's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador"&gt;Newfoundland and Labrador&lt;/a&gt; in a small helium filed balloon in an attempt to make the Trans-&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAtlantic%20Ocean"&gt;Atlantic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; crossing in the smallest balloon ever to make such a crossing. The final destination of the landing is not known and will be determined as the flight nears its end. The craft is made of light weight material with just enough space for necessary equipment and cooking implements. The basket is small and has openings in the side for Hempleman-Adams to extend his legs as he sleeps. Hempleman-Adams is hoping to make the crossing in three to four days and reach &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; by July 5 or 6th.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAlinghi"&gt;Alinghi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has defeated &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATeam%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Team New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by one second in the seventh race to win the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2007%20America%27s%20Cup"&gt;32nd America's Cup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in a close run race. The final score was five wins for Alinghi and two for Team New Zealand in the best of nine challenge.

Skipper Brad Butterworth, coincidently a &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;er, led the Switzerland-based boat to a second straight "Auld Mug" trophy.

The race started with Team New Zealand, skippered by Dean Barker, having a slight advantage. This was soon lost to Alinghi however, ending the first mark with a seven second lead. Nearing the end of the second mark, Team New Zealand managed to overtake Alinghi to gain a 14 second lead.

However, when SUI-100 were catching up to NZL-92, Team New Zealand were penalised for port-starboard incident. Team New Zealand then lost the lead.

&lt;a href="Switzerland"&gt;Swiss&lt;/a&gt; President Micheline Calmy-Rey congratulated the team, sending a telegram that read: "We Swiss find our way at sea, not just in the mountains."

Micheline Calmy-Rey, president of Switzerland, sent a telegram to the team congratulating them of their win. "We Swiss find our way at sea, not just in the mountains," referring to Switzerland being most popular for Alpine skiing.

Managing director of Team New Zealand, Grant Dalton, said, "All credit to Alinghi. They kept it close when we got past them on the first run they just kept on sailing the way they do and beat us fair and square in the end."

"It don’t think the margin today really matters. They still won it."

The New Zealand Government has announced that it is setting aside NZ$10 million to help retain key yachties. This is just under double what the government gave them after the loss in 2003.

Sports and recreation minister for New Zealand, Trevor Mallard, said, "It is the view of the government that the team should continue, that it should be based in New Zealand and that Auckland should host an America's Cup regatta again."

Yesterday Wikinews reported that the prison sentence of &lt;a href="w%3ALewis%20Libby"&gt;I. Lewis 'Scooter' Libby&lt;/a&gt; was commuted by US President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;. Today Senator &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Biden"&gt;Joe Biden&lt;/a&gt; of Delaware, a &lt;a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; hopeful for the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202008"&gt;2008 Presidential election&lt;/a&gt;, has issued a statement on his blog critical of the President's actions.

Libby is the former chief of staff for U.S. Vice President &lt;a href="Dick%20Cheney"&gt;Dick Cheney&lt;/a&gt;, and was at the center of the CIA leak scandal, where the identity of former &lt;a href="CIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; agent &lt;a href="w%3AValerie%20Plame"&gt;Valerie Plame&lt;/a&gt; was allegedly leaked to the media by &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; officials. Bush's intervention ensures that Libby will not serve jail time, however Libby must still pay a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;250,000 fine and undergo two years of probation.

Biden goes on to suggest that "George Bush's disregard for the rule of law is truly unbecoming a President. In 2000, when you ran for president, you promised to 'uphold the honor and dignity' of the office of President of the United States—we're still waiting."

According to ♡❤The Journal News♡❤ the road was closed in both directions. Police and workers from the utility company, &lt;a href="w%3AConsolidated%20Edison"&gt;Con Edison&lt;/a&gt;, were on the scene inspecting the damage. The utility pole had snapped at the bottom and it was leaning on the bus.

♡❤Wikinews♡❤ went to the crash site and found that Con Edison crews were still working to replace the pole. Nearly five hours after the crash, a new pole had been installed and the old one was being held parallel up against it. Workers were transferring the wires onto the new pole.

Kensico Road had been reopened, but only in one lane. Workers let traffic pass alternating between one direction and then the other. Ironically, the green sign that is affixed to the pole reads "DMV test site starts here."

&lt;a href="w%3AHamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt; has begun to use force to release captured &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20news"&gt;BBC news&lt;/a&gt; reporter &lt;a href="Alan%20Johnston"&gt;Alan Johnston&lt;/a&gt;. Hamas also plans to release ten of its soldiers who were captured on Monday.

Johnston was kidnapped in &lt;a href="w%3AGaza%20City"&gt;Gaza City&lt;/a&gt; on March 12, and has since been kept in captivity by a group calling itself ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AArmy%20of%20Islam%20%28Gaza%20Strip%29"&gt;The Army of Islam&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. Despite mounting diplomatic pressure from Hamas and the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Government"&gt;British Government&lt;/a&gt;, Johnston has not yet been released.

The actions by Hamas come after reports that The Army of Islam planned to capture more journalists in order to strengthen their position, bargaining for the release of &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraqi&lt;/a&gt; Sajeda Rishawi, imprisoned in &lt;a href="w%3AJordan"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt;. 

Hamas' armed division is reported to have surrounded the neighbourhood of &lt;a href="w%3ASabra"&gt;Sabra&lt;/a&gt; in Gaza, taking control of the suburb. The Army of Islam has threatened to kill Johnston should any rescue attempt be made using force. One civilian fatality has been reported as a result of the fighting between Hamas militants and The Army of Islam.

However, a spokesperson for Hamas said, "This operation is not aimed at freeing Johnston," suggesting the primary objective is freeing its own men.

<h1>New 'clean water' funding for Djibouti's drought-stricken rural areas</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=New%20%27clean%20water%27%20funding%20for%20Djibouti%27s%20drought-stricken%20rural%20areas&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

With the announcement Monday of &lt;a href="w%3AEuro"&gt;€&lt;/a&gt;2 million in new funding from the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; (EU), the &lt;a href="w%3ADjibouti"&gt;Republic of Djibouti's&lt;/a&gt; Ministry of Agriculture hopes to provide some relief to an estimated 25,000 rural inhabitants suffering through severe drought conditions. The money, to be channeled through &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Children%27s%20Fund"&gt;UNICEF&lt;/a&gt; for its water and sanitation program, will be used to develop new wells and improve existing ones.

UNICEF is to contribute a further €60,000, as well as technical expertise to the Ministry of Agriculture, who will carry out the bulk of the work.

“The two-year water supply project targeting rural districts is very significant since people living in 45 villages and their 40,000 heads of cattle will have access to clean drinking water,” said Joaquin Gonzalez, EU Representative in Djibouti.

At the same time, the UN aid agency &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Food%20Programme"&gt;World Food Program&lt;/a&gt; (WFP) indicated that it is working with the Ministry of Agriculture and UNICEF to gradually shift Djibouti's reliance on emergency aid to a Food for Work program, which it hopes will assist nomadic herders in Djibouti with long-term sustainability. "What we are trying to do together with the Ministry of Agriculture and UNICEF is, for example to dig wells so that despite drought, these herders will be able to irrigate their fields," said Simon Pluess, WFP spokesman. "And, together with the &lt;a href="w%3AFood%20and%20Agriculture%20Organization"&gt;UN Food and Agriculture Organization&lt;/a&gt;, we will try and promote vegetable gardens."

Djibouti has survived harsh drought conditions for the past 5 years. Groundwater is the primary source of water for drinking and irrigation, but has been difficult to exploit and is often contaminated. Almost 50 percent of people in rural Djibouti do not have ready access to properly developed source of drinking water. And, due to the ongoing drought, water availability for livestock is limited. Livestock have shown signs of distress and, subsequently, milk production is down substantially. 

Nearly half of all families in Djibouti's northwest were forced to migrate to find pasture for their livestock. As the droughts continue, the importance of properly maintained wells has become apparent. “Life is harder and harder for us. Years ago there were more rains and also more pastureland for cattle. Now it is good for us to have functioning wells so that we can keep cattle here,” said Anou Amada, farmer in the village of Andoli.

A 2006 survey indicated that only 15 percent of wells in Djibouti were equipped with a protective concrete wall to prevent contamination. Andoli's well is one of many undergoing repair through WFP's Food for Work project.

“WFP couldn’t do this alone, so we work with the Ministry of Agriculture and UNICEF to dig wells and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization for vegetable gardens,” said Benoit Thiry, Director, WFP in Djibouti.

When the project is completed in 2008, it will have increased Djibouti's water pump capacity by adding 25 solar-power pumps, which would compliment the current 61 diesel-powered pumps. "The advantage of solar...is that it is much cheaper and requires less maintenance," said Omar Habib, UNICEF communication specialist. "We want the people to participate and to appropriate these pumping stations. The government’s role in the long term should be as restricted as possible," he added.

The BBC's correspondent &lt;a href="Alan%20Johnston"&gt;Alan Johnston&lt;/a&gt; based in &lt;a href="w%3AGaza"&gt;Gaza&lt;/a&gt; has been freed after almost four months in captivity. The &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; broadcast images of Alan Johnston leaving a building in Gaza and entering a white car.

Hamas police surrounded a building where it was believed Johnston was being held. Earlier, Hamas had captured several members of the Army of Islam and continued to put pressure, by threat of force, on the captors. An intervention by another militant group, the &lt;a href="w%3APopular%20Resistance%20Committees"&gt;Popular Resistance Committees&lt;/a&gt;, led to a breakthrough in negotiations between Hamas and the Army of Islam.

Rallies were held worldwide and an online petition calling for Johnston's release was signed by over 200,000 people. On Johnston's appearance after his release a witness said that he appeared healthy, but had lost weight.

"We have been able to close this chapter which has harmed the image of our people greatly," said &lt;a href="w%3AKhaled%20Mashal"&gt;Khaled Meshaal&lt;/a&gt;, leader of &lt;a href="w%3AHamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt;. "The efforts by Hamas have produced the freedom of Alan Johnston." 

On the subject of &lt;a href="w%3AFatah"&gt;Fatah&lt;/a&gt;, Meshaal told Reuters, "It showed the difference between the era in which a group used to encourage and commit security anarchy and chaos and the current situation in which Hamas is seeking to stabilise security." Hamas had stated that they were anxious to have Johnston freed to highlight differences in their ability to provide security in Gaza as compared to Fatah.

Alan Johnston was the only western correspondent working full-time in Gaza. He went missing on March 12th 2007. Concern for his safety grew last month as a video released by the Army of Islam showed Johnston wearing a vest packed with explosives.

In a press conference with Hamas Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AIsmail%20Haniya"&gt;Ismail Haniya&lt;/a&gt;, Alan Johnston said he felt 'buried alive and detached from the world' and that he gained hope through listening to the radio and the support that he has received from around the world. He also thanked the &lt;a href="w%3AHamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt; leader and security services.

His parents held a press conference just after 7 a.m. (BST) on the 4th of July. The parents said that they never gave up hope over the 114 days. They received a phone call late last night where he told them briefly that he was okay. The parents ended wanting to thank people for helping them get through this difficult time and for keeping their spirits up.

&lt;a href="w%3AGordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister of Britain issued a statement on the release of Alan Johnston at his first &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%27s%20Questions"&gt;Prime Minister's Questions&lt;/a&gt;. "I welcome the good news of Alan Johnston's release. This will come as a great relief to his family and friends, and all those who have worked to see him freed."

At 2:15 p.m. (BST) a rally was held at &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20Television%20Centre"&gt;BBC Television Centre&lt;/a&gt; which over one hundred BBC staff attended. At the same time the 'Free Alan Johnston' poster which was attached to the side of the Television Centre was taken down. Alan Johnston also thanked the people at the rally and was amazed at the support he has been given.

The 9th summit of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAssembly%20of%20the%20African%20Union"&gt;Assembly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the &lt;a href="African%20Union"&gt;African Union&lt;/a&gt; ended in &lt;a href="Accra"&gt;Accra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Ghana"&gt;Ghana&lt;/a&gt; just before midnight yesterday. The three day summit, which was scheduled to last until the afternoon of July 3 overran, ending just before midnight.

The main issue discussed was the call for the setting up of a Pan-African government. The &lt;a href="Libya"&gt;Libya&lt;/a&gt;n leader, &lt;a href="Muamar%20al-Gaddafi"&gt;Muamar al-Gaddafi&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="Senegal"&gt;Senegal&lt;/a&gt;ese President, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAbdoulaye%20Wade"&gt;Abdoulaye Wade&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , were advocates for its establishment as soon as possible. Gaddafi was in favor of a single African army, foreign policy and government. Others such as &lt;a href="Robert%20Mugabe"&gt;Robert Mugabe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Thabo%20Mbeki"&gt;Thabo Mbeki&lt;/a&gt; were more inclined to a more gradual process of integration. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AYoweri%20Museveni"&gt;Yoweri Museveni&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , of &lt;a href="Uganda"&gt;Uganda&lt;/a&gt;, preferred more economic integration to political union, as he felt Africa was too diverse to be under one government.

The African leaders put out a unanimous declaration agreeing to set up a Ministerial Committee to examine the relationship between an African Union government and the various national governments. The committee would also be expected to look at the impact on the sovereignty of member states and to provide a time frame and road map for the process.

The idea of a continental government was first advocated by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKwame%20Nkrumah"&gt;Kwame Nkrumah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of Ghana in the mid fifties and sixties when he was the Ghanaian president. It however received very little support at the time.

The host of the summit, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Kufuor"&gt;John Kufuor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of Ghana, Chairman of the Union, said there had been no winners or losers and that the debate had been characterised by tolerance and mutual respect. He said Africa's union was not being modelled on that of the &lt;a href="US"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt; nor the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; but rather on model that would be unique to the continent. He was also keen on the rationalization of the various Regional Economic Commissions towards the realization of an African Economic Commission.

The next summit is scheduled for &lt;a href="Addis%20Ababa"&gt;Addis Ababa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Ethiopia"&gt;Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt; in 2008.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Indies%20cricket%20team"&gt;West Indies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have beaten &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEngland%20cricket%20team"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by 61 runs in the second &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOne-Day%20International"&gt;One-Day International&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Indian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%202007"&gt;West Indies tour of England&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEdgbaston%20Cricket%20Ground"&gt;Edgbaston&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABirmingham"&gt;Birmingham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;.

West Indies recorded a challenging total of 278-5. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AShivnarine%20Chanderpaul"&gt;Shivnarine Chanderpaul&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; scored 116 not out off 122 balls to post his seventh century in One-Day Internationals. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMarlon%20Samuels"&gt;Marlon Samuels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; scored 77, while &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Gayle"&gt;Chris Gayle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADevon%20Smith"&gt;Devon Smith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; shared an opening partnership of 50.

The England batsmen struggled in comparison, with opener &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAlastair%20Cook"&gt;Alastair Cook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; departing for just 19 and a controversial &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALeg%20before%20wicket"&gt;LBW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; decision for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIan%20Bell%20%28cricketer%29"&gt;Ian Bell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; reducing them to 30-2. Top scorers for England were &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMatt%20Prior"&gt;Matt Prior&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with 52 and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOwais%20Shah"&gt;Owais Shah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with 45. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARavi%20Rampaul"&gt;Ravi Rampaul&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was the pick of the West Indian bowlers with 4-41.

Conditions at Edgbaston were damp, with rain interrupting the match on three occasions.

The three match series is now tied at 1-1. The third and final ODI, and series decider, will be played at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATrent%20Bridge"&gt;Trent Bridge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANottingham"&gt;Nottingham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on 7th July.

Previously on the tour, England won a four match &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATest%20cricket"&gt;Test&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; series 3-0 and drew a two match &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATwenty20"&gt;Twenty20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; series 1-1.

<h1>Pittsburgh playwrights pen furry musical, invite Anthrocon attendees to observe reading</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Pittsburgh%20playwrights%20pen%20furry%20musical%2C%20invite%20Anthrocon%20attendees%20to%20observe%20reading&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

When &lt;a href="w%3APittsburgh"&gt;Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Alyricist"&gt;lyricist&lt;/a&gt; Bill Medica and musician JC Carter saw the influx of furries for the first Anthrocon in their city, they were mystified. But as they observed &lt;a href="w%3AAnthrocon"&gt;Anthrocon&lt;/a&gt; 2006, their thoughts on furries changed.

"They're not afraid to be themselves," said Carter. "When they left, the magic left."

"They were such a force," added Medica.

Inspired by their experience, they decided to write a play entitled ♡❤Furry Tales♡❤. It is the story of four friends: BlueWolf22, MisoKitty2, HuggyBunny and Gorillanator. They met online and agree to meet at a furry convention. As it turns out, BlueWolf22 is an imposter, sent by an online magazine called "everythingawful.com" (an obvious play on Something Awful, a site frowned on by the sub-culture &lt;a href="http%3A//www.somethingawful.com/d/awful-links/awful-link-2207.php"&gt;for their coverage&lt;/a&gt;) in an effort to get some steamy content on the debauchery that supposedly permeates the furry fandom. However, BlueWolf's opinions change, and he discovers he is a peer to his new furry friends.

Wikipedia describes &lt;a href="w%3Afurry%20fandom"&gt;furry fandom&lt;/a&gt; as "a fandom distinguished by its enjoyment of anthropomorphic, often humanoid, animal characters. Examples of anthropomorphism in the furry fandom include the attribution of human intelligence, facial expressions, and sometimes anatomy, speech, bipedalism, and the wearing of clothes."

The world's largest furry convention, Anthrocon takes place in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania each July. Its focus is on furries: fictional anthropomorphized animal characters in art and literature.

The first staged reading of Furry Tales will occur on July 5, 2007, on the first day of festivities for Anthrocon 2007, at the CLO Cabaret. Medica and Carter planned it for July 5 in the hopes that furries attending Anthrocon will provide input for improving the final product. The Chairman of Anthrocon Dr. Samuel Conway has been invited to the reading, and he has confirmed plans to attend.

Tickets may be reserved online for $15 each plus a service charge of at least $7.50 from Pittsburgh Cultural District.

In related news, Anthrocon has selected local no-kill animal shelter Animal Friends as its 2007 charity. The shelter will benefit from the proceeds of Anthrocon's annual charity auction, which raised $5,845 for the Western Pennsylvania National Wild Animal Orphanage last year (the charity's total revenue was $8,400). Representatives of the charity will also be available as in the dealers room.

Hovind filed an appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals claiming he was prevented from challenging the amount of his tax liability. According to the &lt;a href="w%3APensacola%20News%20Journal"&gt;Pensacola News Journal&lt;/a&gt;, "the three-judge panel ruled that Hovind failed to raise the issue at the right time, so he waived his rights to contest his tax liability."

On July 7, 2006 in (Docket number 011894-05L) the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Tax%20Court"&gt;United States Tax Court&lt;/a&gt; found that Hovind was deficient in paying his federal income taxes in tax years 1995-97 in the amount of $504,957.24. The Tax Court ruled that the IRS had a valid, perfected lien on Hovind's property in that amount. In the Memorandum Opinion the judge noted that Hovind's defense was based on "bizarre arguments" and "some of which constitute &lt;a href="w%3Atax%20protester%20arguments"&gt;tax protester arguments&lt;/a&gt; involving excise taxes and the alleged '&lt;a href="w%3ATax%20protester%20statutory%20arguments"&gt;100% voluntary&lt;/a&gt;' nature of the income tax."

In the November 2006 case Kent was convicted of 58 counts while Jo Hovind, his wife, was convicted of 44 counts, and both decided not to present a defense at trial. In January Hovind was sentenced to ten years plus fines and probation, and last Friday June 29, 2007, Jo Hovind was sentence to one year and one day plus probation and fines.

Though the couple were indicted on the November charges last summer in July 2006, they had a long history of &lt;a href="w%3ATax%20protester"&gt;tax protesting&lt;/a&gt;, filing false bankruptcy claims, filing frivolous lawsuits, and running the &lt;a href="w%3AKent%20Hovind%23Creation%20Science%20Evangelism%20Ministry"&gt;Creation Science Evangelism Ministry&lt;/a&gt; (CSE) without proper licensing. In court the IRS noted Kent Hovind had never filed any income taxes with the agency.

According to the &lt;a href="w%3APensacola%20News%20Journal"&gt;Pensacola News Journal&lt;/a&gt;, in court last Friday Eric Hovind, the couple's son, said of his mother "She did what she was told" and she was "a submissive wife." Jo spoke to the court saying, "I had no intention of evading the IRS." She continued, "I really did not have a leadership role in CSE" and finished "I would never knowingly do anything illegal." But the prosecutor said Jo Hovind's statement contradicted the evidence. "I do not believe she's being truthful to the court," the prosecutor told the judge.

At the hearing the judge explained that while "Mr. Hovind was the decision-making authority" at CSE and &lt;a href="w%3AKent_Hovind%23Dinosaur_Adventure_Land"&gt;Dinosaur Adventure Land&lt;/a&gt; in four years Jo Hovind cashed some 200 checks, all under $10,000, for a total of $1.5 million. The judge further noted, the frequent use of cash was "their attempt to keep the ministry under the radar screen of the IRS" and not provide a traceable record. In the end the judge concluded, "Mrs. Hovind was in charge of the payroll," when handing down the sentence. 

The judge said a sentence must be handed down so that it will "promote respect for the law" and deter others who might be tempted to break the law. Jo Hovind received a year and a day in prison, followed by three years probation upon release, and ordered her to pay $8,000 in fines and costs. Kent Hovind received ten years, followed by three years probation upon release, and ordered to pay over $600,000. 

The &lt;a href="w%3APensacola%20News%20Journal"&gt;Pensacola News Journal&lt;/a&gt; further added, "the government also has taken 10 properties from the Hovinds" for money owed.

The &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJoint%20Terrorism%20Analysis%20Centre"&gt;Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (JTAC), a division of the security agency &lt;a href="MI5"&gt;MI5&lt;/a&gt;, has now reduced the United Kingdom threat level from 'critical' to 'severe'.

Since the terrorist attacks in &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Glasgow"&gt;Glasgow&lt;/a&gt; the threat level in the United Kingdom was at 'critical' meaning an "attack was imminent", however the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHome%20Secretary"&gt;Home Secretary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJacqui%20Smith"&gt;Jacqui Smith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , today announced the level was to be reduced.

She said, "There is no intelligence to suggest that an attack is expected imminently. However, the reduction of the threat level to severe does not mean the overall threat has gone away."

The MI5 website stated, "This means that future terrorist attacks are still highly likely, but no longer thought to be imminent. The decision has been made by JTAC based on a review of the latest intelligence."

This reduction comes after eight arrests were made in connection to the terror attacks.

The &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Olympic%20Committee"&gt;International Olympic Committee&lt;/a&gt; awarded the &lt;a href="w%3A2014%20Olympics"&gt;XXII Winter Olympics&lt;/a&gt;, to be held in &lt;a href="w%3A2014"&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href="w%3ASochi%2C%20Russia"&gt;Sochi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, a resort city near the Black Sea, in &lt;a href="w%3AGuatemala%20City"&gt;Guatemala City&lt;/a&gt; yesterday defeating &lt;a href="w%3APyeongchang%2C%20South%20Korea"&gt;Pyeongchang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;, by just four votes. &lt;a href="w%3ASalzburg%2C%20Austria"&gt;Salzburg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Austria"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt;, was eliminated in the first round by 25 votes.

According to the Associated Press, several factors played a part in Sochi's win. One factor was that of &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20Russia"&gt;Russian president&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AVladimir%20Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; himself. Putin, an avid skier and a black belt in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ajudo"&gt;judo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , traveled to &lt;a href="w%3AGuatemala"&gt;Guatemala&lt;/a&gt; to lobby IOC members and headed up the final presentation of Sochi's bid to the assembly. 

"Putin being here was very important, he worked very hard at it. He was nice. He spoke French -- he never speaks French. He spoke English -- he never speaks English," said French IOC member and former ski champion Jean-Claude Killy. 

Patrick Hickey, an Irish member of the IOC agreed. "There's no doubt that President Putin's presence was a massive influence, his performance was superb. He was humble. He spoke in English and French. The second most powerful man in the world said everything will be delivered."

&lt;a href="w%3AJuan%20Antonio%20Samaranch"&gt;Juan Antonio Samaranch&lt;/a&gt;, former IOC president and Spanish ambassador to Russia made a big push for Sochi, which may have swung some key votes according to some IOC members.

"This is, without doubt, not just a recognition of Russia's sporting achievements but it is, beyond any doubt, a judgment on our country, it is a recognition of our growing capability, first of all economically and socially," Putin stated upon his return to Russia. 

Another factor is Russia's brand new wealth from exports of Russian natural gas and oil, which provided over $12 billion for Putin to invest in the Games and the infrastructure around Sochi.

Russia last hosted the games in &lt;a href="w%3A1980%20Summer%20Olympics"&gt;1980&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AMoscow"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt;, when the country was known as the &lt;a href="w%3ASoviet%20Union"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;. The games were &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican-led%20boycott%20of%20the%201980%20Summer%20Olympics"&gt;boycotted&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and some of its allies over the &lt;a href="w%3ASoviet%20invasion%20of%20Afghanistan"&gt;Soviet invasion of Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;.

The United States continues to spar with Russia over human rights abuses and the subjugation of democratic freedoms.

U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack spoke in Washington to reporters stating, "Well, it's a proud moment for Russia and I am sure it's a proud moment for him so he can characterize it as he sees fit, I'm not sure that the selection of Russia to host the Winter Olympics really, at this point, changes our view or others' views -- or concerns -- about the direction of democracy and related issues: human rights, respect for freedom of speech, freedom of assembly and to be able to peaceably organize opposition democratic parties."

Meanwhile, Sochi has announced that progress of construction on venues in Sochi will be offered online. Dmitri Chernyshenko, Sochi 2014's bid leader said, "The IOC will be online every single moment in terms of construction, there will be live video from all construction sites."

The next Olympic bid is for the 2016 Summer Olympics which includes bids from &lt;a href="w%3AChicago"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATokyo%2C%20Japan"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMadrid%2C%20Spain"&gt;Madrid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARio%20de%20Janeiro%2C%20Brazil"&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADoha%2C%20Qatar"&gt;Doha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABaku%2C%20Azerbaijan"&gt;Baku&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3APrague%2C%20Czech%20Republic"&gt;Prague&lt;/a&gt;.

A westbound &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Underground"&gt;London Underground&lt;/a&gt; train has derailed between &lt;a href="w%3AMile%20End%20tube%20station"&gt;Mile End&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABethnal%20Green%20tube%20station"&gt;Bethnal Green&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Line"&gt;Central Line&lt;/a&gt; shortly after 9am &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Summer%20Time"&gt;BST&lt;/a&gt; during the morning rush-hour leaving hundreds of passengers stranded who had to walk along the tracks to leave at the nearest station.

&lt;a href="w%3ATransport%20for%20London"&gt;Transport for London&lt;/a&gt; have said that 20 people received medical attention with five taken to hospital with minor injuries including breathing difficulties. A lot of dust is said to have been disturbed during the incident.

A London Underground spokesman said that "We are investigating a report that at around 9am this morning a Central Line train derailed in a tunnel between Mile End and Bethnal Green. LU is looking into reports that there was an obstruction on the track."

Passengers initially feared that a bomb had exploded but a TfL employee on the train was able to calm the situation by suggesting that he thought it was a derailment. This was later confirmed by the train driver.

Chris Christofi who was on the train described what had happened to the BBC: "We felt a massive jolt underneath the train which caused the train to move up and down and sideways. There were some windows that seemed to blow in and explode and there was some soot that came into the carriage. There was a lot of people crying and upset, a lot of people falling over. We thought there'd been a bomb." 

In a statement, &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Transport%20Police"&gt;British Transport Police&lt;/a&gt; Chief Superintendent Ellie Bird said that "there is nothing to suggest that this a terrorist-related incident".

Central Line services remain suspended between &lt;a href="w%3ALeytonstone%20tube%20station"&gt;Leytonstone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALiverpool%20Street%20tube%20station"&gt;Liverpool Street&lt;/a&gt; causing severe delays on the rest of the line.

At least five to ten police officers in &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; have been killed and at least 11 others were wounded after a suicide bombing in the southern part of the country in the town of &lt;a href="w%3ASpin%20Boldak"&gt;Spin Boldak&lt;/a&gt; at a checkpoint.

Police officers were having lunch inside a room at the checkpoint when the bomber, who was also dressed in a police officer's uniform, walked in and detonated his explosives. At least two rooms were destroyed, according to police.

"We were eating lunch around 1330, when a suicide attacker wearing police uniform entered the post and blew himself up," said Bismillah Khan, commander of the local police in Spin Boldak who could only confirm that "five border police are killed and 11 are injured."

No one has claimed responsibility for the attack.

"I believe this will be the most spectacular Grand Départ the Tour has ever seen and the weekend will underline London’s great sporting reputation," said &lt;a href="w%3AKen%20Livingstone"&gt;Ken Livingstone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMayor"&gt;mayor&lt;/a&gt; of London.

The parts of the Tour that London will be hosting are the ♡❤Prologue♡❤ and ♡❤Stage One♡❤. The ♡❤Prologue♡❤ will be on Saturday, the 7th of July, starting in Trafalgar Square at 15:00 BST and finishing at 18:20 BST. ♡❤Stage One♡❤ will be on the following day, starting in &lt;a href="w%3AGreenwich"&gt;Greenwich&lt;/a&gt; at 11:00 BST and finishing in &lt;a href="w%3ACanterbury"&gt;Canterbury&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AKent"&gt;Kent&lt;/a&gt;.

Over the years the Tour de France has seen 52 &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; riders; the first being Charley Holland and Bill Burl in 1937. Londoners may get to see today's riders on their two wheels, but they will be followed by 1,500 vehicles, 13,000 policemen and women patrolling the route and 2,300 members of the world press.

During the event many roads will be closed along the route and off it. The official website provides detailed information.

To promote &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Simpsons%20Movie"&gt;The Simpsons Movie&lt;/a&gt; that will be released July 26, 2007, over a dozen &lt;a href="w%3A7-Eleven"&gt;7-Elevens&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; have been transformed into &lt;a href="w%3AKwik-E-Mart"&gt;Kwik-E-Marts&lt;/a&gt;, the grocery store from the popular TV series. Most of the other 7-Eleven stores will also sell products with brands reminding of &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Simpsons"&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/a&gt;, such as Buzz Cola, Krustyo's cereal, squishees, and &lt;a href="w%3ABart%20Simpson"&gt;Bart Simpson's&lt;/a&gt; favourite comic book &lt;a href="w%3ARadioactive%20Man"&gt;Radioactive Man&lt;/a&gt;, but not &lt;a href="w%3ADuff%20Beer"&gt;Duff Beer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHomer%20Simpson"&gt;Homer's&lt;/a&gt; favourite drink.

Inside the outlets are employees dressed like Simpsons characters such as &lt;a href="w%3AMarge%20Simpson"&gt;Marge&lt;/a&gt;, Homer and Bart Simpson.

In the &lt;a href="w%3A20th%20Century%20Fox"&gt;20th Century Fox&lt;/a&gt; series, the &lt;a href="w%3ASpringfield%20%28The%20Simpsons%29"&gt;Springfield&lt;/a&gt; Kwik-E-Mart is run by &lt;a href="w%3AApu%20Nahasapeemapetilon"&gt;Apu Nahasapeemapetilon&lt;/a&gt;, a stereotypical &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;n shopkeeper who always greets his customers with "Thank you, come again", lives for his store but also changes the expiration dates on Kwik-E-Mart products.

&lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney's&lt;/a&gt; transport systems fell into chaos on Friday after gale force winds caused damage to an overhead train line on the &lt;a href="w%3ASydney%20Harbour%20Bridge"&gt;Sydney Harbour Bridge&lt;/a&gt;. Services on the &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Shore%20railway%20line%2C%20Sydney"&gt;North Shore Line&lt;/a&gt; were cancelled, leaving commuters stranded in the city.

Just after 2:30 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3ATime%20in%20Australia"&gt;AEST&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC%2B10"&gt;UTC+10&lt;/a&gt;), a maintenance hatch blew from a train travelling North on the Harbour Bridge hitting overhead lines and landing in northbound traffic lanes. The hatch caused damage to around 300 metres of overhead line, causing &lt;a href="w%3ACityrail"&gt;Cityrail&lt;/a&gt; to cancel services between &lt;a href="w%3AWynyard%20railway%20station%2C%20Sydney"&gt;Wynyard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Sydney%20railway%20station%2C%20Sydney"&gt;North Sydney&lt;/a&gt; stations.

The 30 passengers aboard the train were evacuated and placed onto buses shortly after 3:00 p.m. AEST. The Daily Telegraph reported that passengers feared electrocution, as it was uncertain whether or not the fallen lines had come into contact with the bridge. There were also fears for bridge climbers who were on top of the bridge.

The incident causes transport chaos, with bus services replacing trains, traffic congestion on the bridge and the refusal of taxis to carry passengers into the city.

Commuters reported queues of up to one &lt;a href="w%3AKilometre"&gt;kilometre&lt;/a&gt; long in North Sydney waiting for buses and around 200 people waiting for buses at Wynyard. It is believed that passengers at Wynyard had to wait some 45 minutes before buses arrived.

Commuters criticised the government over the way the incident was handled. Commuters said they felt as if nobody knew what was going on and Cityrail transit officers did not seem to be in control. The government responded with Transport Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Watkins"&gt;John Watkins&lt;/a&gt; saying that the government did the best it could under the circumstances.

Mr Watkins said that the government had arranged "an extra 50 buses to run a shuttle service between North Sydney station and Wynard,"

"But when you have a major problem like this, a major breakdown in our rail system, it is going to put pressure on our road system and on other public transport."

Train services were resumed at around 9:00 p.m. AEST between Wynyard and North Sydney, with Cityrail warning that delays should be expected.

On Wednesday &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Boston%20Globe"&gt;♡❤The Boston Globe♡❤&lt;/a&gt; reported that, during the &lt;a href="w%3AWatergate%20scandal"&gt;Watergate scandal&lt;/a&gt;, presidential hopeful &lt;a href="w%3AFred%20Thompson"&gt;Fred Thompson&lt;/a&gt; telephoned &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20M.%20Nixon"&gt;President Nixon's&lt;/a&gt; lawyer informing the administration that the &lt;a href="w%3ASenate%20Watergate%20Committee"&gt;Senate Watergate Committee&lt;/a&gt; "knew about the taping system and would be making the information public." The &lt;a href="w%3AWatergate%20tapes"&gt;Watergate tapes&lt;/a&gt; eventually led to Nixon's resignation, which staved off &lt;a href="w%3Aimpeachment"&gt;impeachment&lt;/a&gt;.

The ♡❤Globe♡❤ reported, "In his all-but-forgotten Watergate memoir, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAt%20That%20Point%20in%20Time"&gt;At That Point in Time&lt;/a&gt;,♡❤ Thompson said he acted with 'no authority' in divulging the committee's knowledge of the tapes, which provided the evidence that led to Nixon's resignation." One of the former investigators for Democrats on the committee, Scott Armstrong, remains upset at Thompson's actions, claiming "Thompson was a &lt;a href="w%3AMole%20%28espionage%29"&gt;mole&lt;/a&gt; for the White House."

&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Dean"&gt;John Dean&lt;/a&gt;, Nixon's former &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House%20counsel"&gt;White House counsel&lt;/a&gt;, said he believed that former &lt;a href="w%3AParty%20leaders%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Senate"&gt;Senate Majority Leader&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House%20Chief%20of%20Staff"&gt;White House Chief of Staff&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AHoward%20Baker"&gt;Howard Baker&lt;/a&gt; and Thompson "were anything but impartial players" in the Watergate investigation. "I knew that Thompson would be Baker's man, trying to protect Nixon," said Dean.

When asked by the ♡❤Globe♡❤ about the story, Thompson responded via e-mail stating: "I'm glad all of this has finally caused someone to read my Watergate book, even though it's taken them over thirty years."

In a related issue, Howard Baker insisted that Thompson be allowed to question presidential aide &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Butterfield"&gt;Alexander Butterfield&lt;/a&gt; about the taping system in a public session on July 16, 1973, which was three days after the committee had learned about the system. &lt;a href="w%3ASamuel%20Dash"&gt;Samuel Dash&lt;/a&gt; expressed concern at the choice of Thompson, since the information was revealed in private sessions by another investigator prior to the public session.

Regarding the leak, ♡❤the Globe♡❤ wrote, "The view of Thompson as a Nixon mole is strikingly at odds with the former Tennessee senator's longtime image as an independent-minded prosecutor who helped bring down the president he admired."

Thompson has long been seen as a Washington "insider" who began his lobbying career in 1975. Lobbying accounts for approximately 80 percent of Thompson's total income and lobbying the federal government alone has earned him more than US$1 million. On behalf of one of his clients, the &lt;a href="w%3ATennessee%20Savings%20and%20Loan%20League"&gt;Tennessee Savings and Loan League&lt;/a&gt;, Thompson lobbied for the bill that deregulated the savings-and-loan industry. According to CNN, "Experts say the final version of that bill played a large role in the &lt;a href="w%3ASavings%20and%20Loan%20crisis"&gt;savings-and-loan crisis&lt;/a&gt; of the late 1980s, opening the door to widespread fraud and mismanagement." Thompson most recently helped raise money for &lt;a href="w%3ALewis%20Libby"&gt;Lewis "Scooter" Libby's&lt;/a&gt; recent defense for perjury and obstruction of justice. Thompson held a fundraising party at his house for Libby.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; police have questioned four more people in connection with the failed bombing attempts in &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGlasgow"&gt;Glasgow&lt;/a&gt;, seizing computers and other evidence in several raids.

The four being questioned are all doctors, working in hospitals in &lt;a href="w%3APerth"&gt;Perth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AKalgoorlie"&gt;Kalgoorlie&lt;/a&gt;. They are reported to be of &lt;a href="w%3AIndian"&gt;Indian&lt;/a&gt; origin, and have all been linked to the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Health%20Service"&gt;UK's National Health Service&lt;/a&gt;. Two of the men arrested in the UK have similarly been linked to Western Australian hospitals, to which they had applied for jobs, receiving multiple rejections.

Police have been granted an extra 96 hours to question Mohammed Haneef, who was arrested at &lt;a href="w%3ABrisbane%20Airport"&gt;Brisbane International Airport&lt;/a&gt; on July 3. They will be examining several thousand files stored on Haneef's laptop and a mobile telephone &lt;a href="w%3ASIM%20card"&gt;SIM card&lt;/a&gt; which had been left with a suspect.

Raids have also taken place in &lt;a href="w%3ACambridge"&gt;Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUK"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;, at which four of the arrested suspects are believed to have lived and met in 2005.

The four men being questioned in Australia have not currently been placed under arrest, but are described as having links to the UK by the Federal Police Commissioner, &lt;a href="w%3AMick%20Keelty"&gt;Mick Keelty&lt;/a&gt;.

Ice samples retrieved from 1.2 miles (2 km) beneath the surface of &lt;a href="Greenland"&gt;Greenland&lt;/a&gt; have uncovered the oldest known samples of &lt;a href="w%3ADNA"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt; from insects. The samples, estimated to be 450,000-900,000 years old, have also shown that no more than one million years ago, Greenland was once home to forests and animal life.

"We have shown for the first time that southern Greenland, which is hidden under 2 km of ice, was once very different to the Greenland we see today. Back then, it was inhabited by a diverse array of conifer trees and insects," said Professor and leader of the team who made the discovery, at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Copenhagen"&gt;University of Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Denmark"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt;, Eske Willerslev.

"This genetic material presents a biological environment which is completely different to today. We have found grain, pine, yew and alder. These correspond to the landscapes we find in eastern &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href="Sweden"&gt;Swedish&lt;/a&gt; forests today," added Willerslev.

Willerslev also says that because of the presence of the yews, the temperatures in that area of Greenland could not have been "lower than -17 degrees Celsius" and that with the variety of other trees, the summer temperatures were no lower than "10 degrees Celsius."

These findings could change the history of Greenland. The current theory is that Greenland was free from its ice no more than 125,000 years ago. The results of the findings now suggest that Greenland may have been covered with ice for at least 450,000 years.

During a flight Friday from &lt;a href="w%3AIslamabad%20International%20Airport"&gt;Chaklala Airbase&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ARawalpindi"&gt;Rawalpindi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3ABalochistan%20%28Pakistan%29"&gt;Balochistan province&lt;/a&gt;, President &lt;a href="Pervez%20Musharraf"&gt;Pervez Musharraf&lt;/a&gt;'s plane was shot at from a rooftop near the flight path. Musharraf was flying to Balochistan province to observe the effects of recent flooding in the area.

The Pakistani government has officially denied the plane came under fire, but a Paksitani intelligence officer indicated, off the record, that an attempt of Mushaffaf's life had occurred. Musharraf's plane arrived safely at its destination. However, sources say that Intelligence agencies in Pakistan are investigating into possible connection between attack on the plane and the siege of Lal Masjid.

Police have cordoned off a house in Rawalpindi to investigate the incident. ♡❤Reuters♡❤ news agency had a photographer in the area at the time, and reported seeing two guns on the roof of the house, one of them an anti-aircraft gun, which had been mounted on the roof. The other gun was reported to be a machinegun. Deputy Inspector General of police Marwat Ali Shah confirmed that an anti-aircraft gun, a machine gun and ammunition had been recovered from the home. 

Local residents reported hearing the sound of gunfire. "Everyone heard a firing sound," Ishaq Ahmed told ♡❤BBC News♡❤. "The firing sound was like a bomb blast. It was that kind of sound." Some witnesses claimed that they saw a person along with a woman and two kids escaping on a motorbike after the incident.

General Musharraf has survived two previous attempts on his life, carried out on December 14, 2003 by &lt;a href="al-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;-linked militants. There is no indication or claim of responsibility, as yet, as to who carried out the latest attack.

Authorities from the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFBI"&gt;Federal Bureau of Investigation&lt;/a&gt; are currently investigating death threats targeted towards the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; investment firm &lt;a href="w%3AGoldman%20Sachs"&gt;Goldman Sachs&lt;/a&gt;. Threatening letters were sent to 20 U.S. newspapers, stating: "Goldman Sachs. Hundreds will die. We are inside. You cannot stop us."

The letter was described as being neatly written in red ink on blue-lined loose-leaf paper, and was signed "A.Q.U.S.A". The letters were believed to have been mailed from &lt;a href="w%3AQueens%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Queens, New York&lt;/a&gt;. The bank is working closely with law enforcement authorities, however, it was told by Goldman Sachs that the threat is not likely to be credible.

A spokesperson for the bank says they take any threat very seriously. "We have a broad range of security measures in place to counter all likely threats and we're monitoring the situation closely."

Goldman Sachs is headquartered in New York and maintains offices in London, Frankfurt, Tokyo, Hong Kong and other major financial centers. More than 3,000 of its employees work in &lt;a href="w%3AJersey%20City"&gt;Jersey City, New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;, in the state's tallest building.

&lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; has extended the warranty on its &lt;a href="w%3AXbox%20360"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Avideo%20game%20console"&gt;video game console&lt;/a&gt; to three years from the date of purchase following a large number of problems with the console and "an unacceptable number of repairs", costing the company more than one billion &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20dollar"&gt;US dollar&lt;/a&gt;s.

The fault, which has been dubbed the "red ring of death", causes the console to fail completely. 

In an open letter to owners of the Xbox 360, &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Moore%20%28Microsoft%29"&gt;Peter Moore&lt;/a&gt; of Microsoft said, "As of today, all Xbox 360 consoles are covered by an enhanced warranty program to address specifically the general hardware failures indicated by the three flashing red lights on the console. This applies to new and previously-sold consoles." The extended warranty covers repairing and shipping of the console and the company has promised to reimburse those owners who have already had to pay for repairs.

Microsoft has not released details of the number of units that have suffered from the problem but has said it is "bigger than we are comfortable with".

The Xbox 360 was launched by Microsoft in 2005 and in January of this year the company lowered its sales expectations to 12 million units for the year ending June 2007.

<h1>New avian flu outbreaks reported in western Europe</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=New%20avian%20flu%20outbreaks%20reported%20in%20western%20Europe&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

German scientists discovered the outbreak after receiving 38 confirmed cases, all of which came from the eastern states of &lt;a href="w%3ASaxony-Anhalt"&gt;Saxony-Anhalt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AThuringia"&gt;Thuringia&lt;/a&gt;.

In France, three swans have been found dead in an &lt;a href="w%3AAssenoncourt"&gt;Assenoncourt&lt;/a&gt; pond sparking a massive response from French authorities. Most bird related activities have been banned and a control zone half a mile (c. 800 metres) in radius has been placed around the pond. Careful monitoring will take place for any further deaths or signs of illness in this area.

Many commercial poultry owners have been told to keep their birds inside as a precaution to prevent the disease from spreading further through &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;.

French health minister &lt;a href="w%3ARoselyn%20Bachelot"&gt;Roselyn Bachelot&lt;/a&gt; has stated that the current state of alert is appropriate, given the potential risk to human life posed by influenza.

Authorities fear the virus may spread across Europe and cause a &lt;a href="w%3Apandemic"&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, as was seen in &lt;a href="Asia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt; and Europe last year. 

Following the outbreak of 2006, 13 &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;EU&lt;/a&gt; members (namely &lt;a href="w%3AAustria"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABritain"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACzech%20Republic"&gt;the Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADenmark"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt;, France, Germany, &lt;a href="w%3AGreece"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHungary"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APoland"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASlovakia"&gt;Slovakia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASlovenia"&gt;Slovenia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;) had all confirmed cases of bird flu.

In April last year, France found that more than 60 wild birds at a farm with 11,000 &lt;a href="w%3Aturkey"&gt;turkeys&lt;/a&gt; were infected with H5N1. Globally, where it has spread to humans, the virus has killed almost two thirds of the 300 reported cases, according to the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organisation"&gt;WHO&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; Toshiba Transatlantic Challenge pilot, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Hempleman-Adams"&gt;David Hempleman-Adams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , successfully crossed the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;Atlantic&lt;/span&gt; and in doing so broke 5 world records. His &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ahelium"&gt;helium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; gas balloon landed safely in the &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; countryside on Friday evening.

The explorer is known for the grueling challenges he undertakes. Having created the "Adventurers' Grand Slam" in which he visited both geographical and magnetic poles and climbed the highest peaks in each of the seven continents, this is his latest undertaking.

Monday saw Hempleman-Adams leave &lt;a href="Newfoundland"&gt;Newfoundland&lt;/a&gt; in his balloon. The successful crossing netted him the record for distance travelled in that size of balloon, although he battled with sleep deprivation in the latter stages of the journey.

Just days after the introduction of the partial ban on smoking in &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Democrats"&gt;Liberal Democrats&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMember%20of%20Parliament"&gt;Member of Parliament&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Kennedy"&gt;Charles Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; has been caught smoking on a train today. The incident occurred on the 1105 &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20European%20Summer%20Time"&gt;BST&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC%2B1"&gt;UTC+1&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href="w%3APaddington"&gt;Paddington&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3APlymouth"&gt;Plymouth&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFirst%20Great%20Western"&gt;First Great Western&lt;/a&gt; service.

The train manager is reported to have contacted the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Transport%20Police"&gt;British Transport Police&lt;/a&gt;, who met the train when it arrived in Plymouth, and has said that "the matter was resolved informally". A police spokesman said, "He basically said he thought it was OK because he was leaning out of a window". Kennedy was informed that this wasn't the case and was not arrested.

Kennedy has tried to quit smoking for a while and, speaking before the birth of his son said "I am determined that it is going to be phased out altogether - particularly since the arrival of the new one."

A ban on smoking in indoor public places came into force on July 1 in England and anyone caught smoking illegally can be fined up to &lt;a href="w%3APound%20sterling"&gt;£&lt;/a&gt;200.

Charles Kennedy was the leader of the Liberal Democrats until January 2006 when he resigned after admitting he was suffering from a problem with alcohol.

A 51-year-old man fired 16 rounds from a semiautomatic handgun from a balcony overlooking the floor of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York-New%20York%20Hotel%20%26amp%3B%20Casino"&gt;New York New York Hotel &amp; Casino&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALas%20Vegas"&gt;Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Nevada"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt;. The shooting left four people with non-life threatening injuries. They were treated and released from a local hospital later that morning.
Steven Zegrean was tackled by two off-duty military reservists who held him down until Las Vegas police reached the scene. The incident occurred at 12:15 a.m. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Time%20Zone"&gt;PST&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUTC-7"&gt;UTC-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ).

Mr. Zegrean was quickly arrested on felony charges including attempted murder, battery with a deadly weapon and discharging a firearm in an occupied structure. It is believed that he was emotionally distraught.

<h1>Fort Lee, Virginia adopts RAPIDGate for fast civilian access</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Fort%20Lee%2C%20Virginia%20adopts%20RAPIDGate%20for%20fast%20civilian%20access&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The U.S. Army installation at &lt;a href="w%3A%20Fort%20Lee%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Fort Lee&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Virginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; will begin using a program called RAPIDGate that will replace passes issued to non-military persons who regularly require access to the facility. The program will take effect July 10, when the practice of issuing 90-day passes to people who present a valid driver’s license, vehicle registration, and proof of insurance for the vehicle used for access ends. Those passes will be grandfathered out as they expire.

The RAPIDGate program for fast entry into Fort Lee replaces what was once access privileges performed by the installation itself, which came free of cost. The new outsourced program administered by &lt;a href="w%3A%20Portland%2C%20Oregon"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Oregon"&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt;-based Eid Passport, Inc. enhances security to the installation by performing background checks. Their service comes at a price. The screening process makes a ten-year felony background check, performs a check against terrorist and sexual offender watch lists, and does a social security cross reference to validate a person’s identity.

Qualified applicants are issued a pass that enables them to bypass inspection pits and use any of the facility’s seven gates for access. Businesses whose employees would benefit by this are required to contact the program provider and have "point of contact" persons who can validate an applicant's employment. Enrollment in the program costs the business US$199. A pass for each employee of the business costs $159 annually. The pass for employees expires after a year, when a new background check is required by the program. 

The program is a voluntary alternative for civilians to conform with new access policies mandated by the Department of Defense and the U.S. Army, according to an information pamphlet distributed by the base. A kiosk will be set up at Fort Lee to accept applications that process a photograph, social security number, and fingerprint.

Those without a RAPIDGate pass will need to enter the fort at locations where their vehicle can be inspected. A rigorous inspection involves armed guards asking the driver to place keys on the dash board, pop the hood and the trunk, open the glove box, and have all occupants exit the vehicle and open all doors, including the hood and trunk. While the vehicle is inspected inside, another guard uses a mirror attached to a wand to inspect under the chassis of the vehicle's undercarriage.

Eid Passport, Inc. specializes in identity authentication and background screening. Fort Lee will be the 12th military installation out of an estimated 250 military installations on U.S soil to implement identity screening as part of new policies mandated by the Department of Defense (DoD).

"The pass contains no personal information," said David Smith, the director of marketing for Eid Passport. It does contain a barcode which is scanned at entry. The RAPIDGate program database includes a &lt;a href="w%3AAutomatic%20Fingerprint%20Identification%20System"&gt;biometric fingerprint&lt;/a&gt; that might be checked by the scanning device against the presenter of the pass in times of elevated security. The pass is also embedded with an active &lt;a href="w%3ARadio-frequency%20identification"&gt;RFID&lt;/a&gt; transmitter. The pass is scanned on entry to the fort at the gate check point, but not upon exit. If the RFID transmitter works properly, movement into and out of the base will be recorded.

The Fort Lee pamphlet mentions a "a new mandate" by the DoD. That mention appears to be in reference to portion of the language found in an Instruction issued in October last year by the DoD that states, "Implement a verification process, whether through background checks or other similar processes, that enables the U.S. Government to attest to the trustworthiness of DoD contractors and sub-contractors."

The Instruction stems from a Directive signed by &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; in August of 2004. That Directive, from the Department of Homeland Security, says in part, "Wide variations in the quality and security of forms of identification used to gain access to secure Federal and other facilities where there is potential for terrorist attacks need to be eliminated."

&lt;a href="w%3A%20Fort%20Lewis"&gt;Fort Lewis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Washington"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; state was the first U.S. military installation to adopt the RAPIDGate program as a test in 2004. Since then, &lt;a href="w%3AFort%20Sam%20Houston"&gt;Fort Sam Houston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFort%20Carson"&gt;Fort Carson&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AFort%20Bragg"&gt;Fort Bragg&lt;/a&gt;, among other installations have adopted the program. 

"What happened at Fort Dix, [New Jersey], as we look at it, is a Fort Dix issue," Laura Arenschield reported spokesman for the 18th Airborne, Tom McCollum, as saying in June. "That should not be taken as an invitation for someone to try it here at Fort Bragg, but (security) is a living, breathing entity. You have to constantly change it just to keep those who are trying to penetrate it on their toes." The new security measures will go into effect at &lt;a href="w%3A%20Fort%20Bragg%2C%20North%20Carolina"&gt;Fort Bragg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="North%20Carolina"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, which is among the largest of domestic military bases, starting July 8.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Indies%20cricket%20team"&gt;West Indies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have beaten &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEngland%20cricket%20team"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by 93 runs in the third and final &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOne-Day%20International"&gt;One-Day International&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Indian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%202007"&gt;West Indies tour of England&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATrent%20Bridge"&gt;Trent Bridge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANottingham"&gt;Nottingham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;. West Indies win the three match series 2-1.

England's bowlers fared poorly, despite removing &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADevon%20Smith"&gt;Devon Smith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; early on, with the West Indies batsmen scoring 116 runs off the last ten overs. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARunako%20Morton"&gt;Runako Morton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (82 not out), &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Gayle"&gt;Chris Gayle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (82) and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADwayne%20Bravo"&gt;Dwayne Bravo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (42 off 24 balls) helped the West Indies to an imposing total of 289-5. The only wickets for England were taken by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALiam%20Plunkett"&gt;Liam Plunkett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (3-59) and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Anderson"&gt;James Anderson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (2-51).

In response, England's batting performance was no better than their fielding. Although &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOwais%20Shah"&gt;Owais Shah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; scored 51, England lost too many batsmen cheaply including &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Pietersen"&gt;Kevin Pietersen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for 0. They were reduced to 196 all out, far short of the 290 runs needed. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFidel%20Edwards"&gt;Fidel Edwards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; took 3-30 and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADaren%20Powell"&gt;Daren Powell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; took 4-40 for the West Indies.

Previously on the tour, England won a four match &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATest%20cricket"&gt;Test&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; series 3-0 and drew a two match &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATwenty20"&gt;Twenty20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; series 1-1.

In an ongoing labor dispute from May of this year in &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, Teamsters Local 952, which represents the &lt;a href="w%3AOCTA"&gt;Orange County Transportation Authority&lt;/a&gt;'s 1,200 coach operators, went on strike at 12:35 a.m. (0035 hrs) PDT Saturday morning after a cooling-off period declared by State Governor &lt;a href="w%3AArnold%20Schwarzenegger"&gt;Arnold Schwarzenegger&lt;/a&gt; expired.

Sanctioned picket lines have been formed outside Authority facilities in Garden Grove, Anaheim, and Santa Ana. About 200,000 regular passengers are affected. 

Major sticking points in the negotiation appear to be related to cost-of-living increases and pension funding allocations. The strike was declared after the Authority's bargaining agent said he lacked authority to approve a union counter proposal, which he said had to be taken before the OCTA's board of directors, who will not be available to meet until Monday the 9th at the earliest.

&lt;a href="w%3AVenus%20Williams"&gt;Venus Williams&lt;/a&gt; triumphed over &lt;a href="w%3AMarion%20Bartoli"&gt;Marion Bartoli&lt;/a&gt; of France 6-4, 6-1 yesterday to win the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Wimbledon%20Championships%20-%20Women%27s%20Singles"&gt;Women's Singles event&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Wimbledon%20Championships"&gt;2007 Wimbledon Championships&lt;/a&gt;.

For the first time, an American and Frenchwoman were matched up to compete for the British women's singles title. A &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Championships%2C%20Wimbledon"&gt;Wimbledon&lt;/a&gt; champion in 2000, 2001 and 2005, Williams was not the favorite to win the title again this year. Currently ranked 23rd in the world, she entered the tournament in the shadow of her sister, &lt;a href="w%3ASerena%20Williams"&gt;Serena Williams&lt;/a&gt;. 

At the beginning of the tennis season, Serena stated her own determination to reclaim the No. 1 ranking. Serena showed better than Venus at the French Open by reaching the quarter finals, and won the Australian Open in January (Venus dropped out due to an injury). In spite of her initial strength, Serena's hopes to dominate the tournament were cut short when she lost to No. 1 seeded &lt;a href="w%3AJustine%20Henin"&gt;Justine Henin&lt;/a&gt; in the quarterfinals.

Bartoli, the eighteenth seed for this year's championships, had never progressed past the fourth round of any Grand Slam event. However, she progressed to the final by defeating third seed &lt;a href="w%3AJelena%20Jankovi%C4%87"&gt;Jelena Janković&lt;/a&gt; in the fourth round and Justine Henin in the semifinals in one of the major upsets of Wimbledon history.

As Henin lost to Bartoli in the semifinals, Venus Williams was poised to become the lowest seeded player in recorded history to win the Wimbledon singles title. With powerhouse serves and an aggressive ground strokes battle, she did just that. Williams comfortably knocked out Bartoli in two straight sets, with match point accidentally striking Bartoli in the wrist. 
Venus was reunited with the Venus Rosewater Dish on Centre Court during the trophy ceremony. Another first, the All England Club is paying men's and women's singles champions equal prize money. Venus was paid $1.407 million, to which she replied "Thank you, All England Club - we're playing under equal terms."

The &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Wimbledon%20Championships%20-%20Men%27s%20Singles"&gt;men's final&lt;/a&gt; takes place later today with first seed and defending champion &lt;a href="w%3ARoger%20Federer"&gt;Roger Federer&lt;/a&gt; taking on second seed &lt;a href="w%3ARafael%20Nadal"&gt;Rafael Nadal&lt;/a&gt; in a repeat of last year's final.

<h1>Group claims Fred Thompson lobbied for abortion-rights, Thompson denies</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Group%20claims%20Fred%20Thompson%20lobbied%20for%20abortion-rights%2C%20Thompson%20denies&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Two days after presidential hopeful &lt;a href="Fred%20Thompson"&gt;Fred Thompson&lt;/a&gt; was branded a 'Mole' for warning &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20M.%20Nixon"&gt;President Nixon's&lt;/a&gt; White House about information the investigating committee had on the &lt;a href="w%3AWatergate%20scandal"&gt;Watergate scandal&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="abortion"&gt;abortion&lt;/a&gt;-rights group claimed that Thompson lobbied for them in the past. A spokesman for Thompson "flatly denied" the claim.

According to the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Family%20Planning%20and%20Reproductive%20Health%20Association"&gt;National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association&lt;/a&gt;, it hired Thompson "to lobby the administration of President &lt;a href="George%20H.W.%20Bush"&gt;George H.W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; to ease a regulation that prevented clinics that received federal money from offering any abortion counseling."

Judith DeSarno, the association’s president at the time, provided the ♡❤LA Times♡❤ with the group’s board minutes of September 1991. In the documents Thompson was hired to "aid us in discussions with the administration." Ms. DeSarno said in an interview that Mr. Thompson served as the group’s liaison to the &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;.

Former Rep. &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20D.%20Barnes"&gt;Michael D. Barnes&lt;/a&gt; who recommended Thompson for the lobbying job, remarked that Thompson's denial is "absolutely bizarre".

The ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20Times"&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ opined that "Thompson's lobbying then would clash directly with the anti-abortion movement he now seeks to rally as a conservative candidate." Thompson has positioned himself as a conservative opponent of abortion rights.

Previously, the &lt;a href="w%3AGannett%20News%20Service"&gt;Gannett News Service&lt;/a&gt; reported that on Thompson’s 1994 campaign questionnaire it contained a handwritten note that stated: "I do not believe abortion should be criminalized. This battle will be won in the hearts and souls of the American people." While in another questionnaire for his 1994 Senate campaign in Tennessee, "Mr. Thompson or his campaign staff checked a box stating that he believed abortion should be legal under any circumstance during the first three months of a pregnancy." Meanwhile in a televised debate the same year, Mr. Thompson told the moderator that he disagreed with outlawing abortion: "Should the government come in and criminalize let’s say a young girl and her parents and her doctor?" Mr. Thompson said. "I think not."

According to the ♡❤LA Times♡❤, while Thompson "sided with antiabortion advocates on most key issues" as Senator (1994 to January 2003) and publicly criticizes the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ARoe%20v%20Wade"&gt;Roe v Wade&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ decision, the article noted "Some conservatives said the [abortion] lobbying claims added to anxieties" about Thomspon.

In 1999, Bernard Weber started the New7Wonders foundation, and eight years, 200 candidates and 100 million votes later, seven man-made structures now have something in common - they all hold the title of 'Wonder'. Weber claims he started the foundation to ensure that "everybody can decide what the new seven wonders should be and not some government, not some individuals, not some institutions."

Nominated structures had to be built or discovered before the year 2000, and out of the 200 nominations, only twenty-one were left by the early part of last year. Voting had been taking place for six months, but only recently did voting result in server crashes, causing the foundation to encourage text message voting.

The results were announced at a ceremony hosted by &lt;a href="w%3AHilary%20Swank"&gt;Hilary Swank&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABen%20Kingsley"&gt;Ben Kingsley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABollywood"&gt;Bollywood&lt;/a&gt; star &lt;a href="w%3ABipasha%20Basu"&gt;Bipasha Basu&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ALisbon"&gt;Lisbon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Portugal"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt;. Out of the twenty-one, the following seven were announced as the new 'Wonders of the World':

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡&lt;a href="w%3AGreat%20Wall%20of%20China"&gt;Great Wall of China&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡, in northern &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;. It was created in the &lt;a href="w%3A5th%20century%20BC"&gt;5th century BC&lt;/a&gt; to protect the northern borders of the &lt;a href="w%3AChinese%20Empire"&gt;Chinese Empire&lt;/a&gt;. The Wall is the world's longest human-made structure, stretching over 6,400 km (4,000 mi).
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡&lt;a href="w%3AChrist%20the%20Redeemer%20%28statue%29"&gt;Christ the Redeemer&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ in &lt;a href="w%3ARio%20de%20Janeiro"&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Brazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;. The giant statue of &lt;a href="w%3AJesus%20Christ"&gt;Jesus Christ&lt;/a&gt; is 38 m (105 ft) tall and weighs 700 tonnes. The statue is located at the peak of the 700 m (2296 ft) &lt;a href="w%3ACorcovado"&gt;Corcovado mountain&lt;/a&gt;, overlooking the city of Rio.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡&lt;a href="w%3AMachu%20Picchu"&gt;Machu Picchu&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡, above the &lt;a href="w%3AUrubamba%20Valley"&gt;Urubamba Valley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Peru"&gt;Peru&lt;/a&gt;. It is a city created by the &lt;a href="w%3AInca%20Empire"&gt;Inca Empire&lt;/a&gt;, located on a mountain ridge. Machu Picchu was forgotten for centuries by the outside world, however not by the locals. It was brought to international attention by archaeologist &lt;a href="w%3AHiram%20Bingham"&gt;Hiram Bingham&lt;/a&gt; in 1911.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡&lt;a href="w%3APetra"&gt;Petra&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡, in &lt;a href="Jordan"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt;. It is famous for having many giant stone structures carved into the rock. The site was revealed to the Western world by the Swiss explorer &lt;a href="w%3AJohann%20Ludwig%20Burckhardt"&gt;Johann Ludwig Burckhardt&lt;/a&gt; in 1812, but remained accessible only to Europeans until after &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20War%20I"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡&lt;a href="w%3AChichen%20Itza"&gt;Chichen Itza&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡, on the &lt;a href="w%3AYucat%C3%A1n%20Peninsula"&gt;Yucatán Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Mexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. It is a large archaeological site originally built by the &lt;a href="w%3AMaya"&gt;Maya&lt;/a&gt; civilization. Chichen Itza was a major regional center in the northern Maya lowlands. Archaeological data suggest that Chichen Itza's collapse was violent.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡&lt;a href="w%3ATaj%20Mahal"&gt;Taj Mahal&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡, in &lt;a href="w%3AAgra"&gt;Agra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;. It is a white marble &lt;a href="w%3Amausoleum"&gt;mausoleum&lt;/a&gt; generally considered the finest example of &lt;a href="w%3AMughal%20architecture"&gt;Mughal architecture&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AMughal%20Empire"&gt;Mughal&lt;/a&gt; Emperor &lt;a href="w%3AShah%20Jahan"&gt;Shah Jahan&lt;/a&gt; commissioned it for his favorite wife, &lt;a href="w%3AMumtaz%20Mahal"&gt;Mumtaz Mahal&lt;/a&gt;, and it was constructed between 1632 and 1648.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡&lt;a href="w%3AColosseum"&gt;Colosseum&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡, in &lt;a href="w%3ARome"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;. It is a giant &lt;a href="w%3Aamphitheatre"&gt;amphitheatre&lt;/a&gt; located in the centre of the city, and was capable of seating around 50,000 spectators. It was constructed between 70 AD and 80 AD, and used for nearly 500 years for a variety of events.

</ul>
Although the foundation had large amounts of public support, &lt;a href="w%3AUNESCO"&gt;UNESCO&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; cultural program, distanced themselves from the project, saying it had "no link whatsoever" to the project. UNESCO currently keeps tabs on 851 places in its '&lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Heritage%20Sites"&gt;World Heritage Sites&lt;/a&gt;' program.

Left out of the Seven are the &lt;a href="w%3APyramids%20of%20Giza"&gt;Pyramids of Giza&lt;/a&gt;, to which a respected Egyptian antiquities expert replied that the pyramids are a "symbol of the genius of the ancient people." The foundation announced that the pyramids would have "honorary status" with the seven. The pyramids were the only remaining of the &lt;a href="w%3ASeven%20Wonders%20of%20the%20World"&gt;original Seven Wonders&lt;/a&gt;.

Weber claims that now that the man-made wonders have been chosen he has a new task: choosing the seven natural wonders of the world. He says he will start his new project immediately.

The &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20AFC%20Asian%20Cup"&gt;2007 AFC Asian Cup&lt;/a&gt; has begun in &lt;a href="w%3ASouth-East%20Asia"&gt;South-East Asia&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href="w%3AThailand%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt; drawing 1-1 with &lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; in the opening match of the tournament.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAFC%20Asian%20Cup"&gt;Asian Cup&lt;/a&gt; is the premier international competition for the &lt;a href="w%3AAsian%20Football%20Confederation"&gt;Asian Football Confederation&lt;/a&gt; (AFC). The 2007 tournament will run from July 7 to July 29, featuring a group stage and then four progressive knock-out rounds.

The 2007 Asian Cup is the first in its' 43-year history to be co-hosted by four nations. &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMalaysia"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AVietnam"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt; will each host one of the four groups, and will take two games each in the knockout rounds. The final is scheduled for &lt;a href="w%3ABung%20Karno%20Stadium"&gt;Bung Karno Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AJakarta"&gt;Jakarta&lt;/a&gt;, Indonesia on July 29.

Heavy rain caused the opening ceremony of the Cup, held at the &lt;a href="w%3ARajamangala%20Stadium"&gt;Rajamangala Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ABangkok"&gt;Bangkok&lt;/a&gt; prior to the Group A match, to be delayed. 

Hosts Thailand took the lead in the sixth minute when &lt;a href="w%3AReferee"&gt;referee&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AKwon%20Jung-Chul"&gt;Kwon Jung-Chul&lt;/a&gt; awarded them a &lt;a href="w%3APenalty%20kick"&gt;penalty&lt;/a&gt; kick. Striker &lt;a href="w%3AKiatisuk%20Senamuang"&gt;Kiatisuk Senamuang&lt;/a&gt; was deemed to have been fouled when brought to ground by Iraqi defender &lt;a href="w%3AAli%20Rehema"&gt;Ali Rehema&lt;/a&gt;.

Iraq nearly equalised in the sixteenth minute after a spectacular overhead '&lt;a href="w%3ABicycle%20kick"&gt;bicycle kick&lt;/a&gt;' by &lt;a href="w%3ASalir%20Sadwn"&gt;Salir Sadwn&lt;/a&gt; was saved by Thailand goalkeeper &lt;a href="w%3AKosin%20Hathairattanakool"&gt;Kosin Hathairattanakool&lt;/a&gt;, who pushed the ball onto the post and eventually cleared. 

Iraq equalised in the thirty-second minute when captain &lt;a href="w%3AYounis%20Mahmoud"&gt;Younis Mahmoud&lt;/a&gt; headed a ball over 'keeper Kosin and into the net from a free kick by Sadwn. Despite dominating the first half, Iraq went into half-time level at 1-1.
Both teams tired in the second half, but the three best chances to take the lead fell to the hosts. &lt;a href="w%3ATherdsak%20Chaiman"&gt;Therdsak Chaiman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ADatsakorn%20Thonglao"&gt;Datsakorn Thonglao&lt;/a&gt; both shot just wide either side of the hour mark, and &lt;a href="w%3ASubstitute"&gt;substitute&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATeeratep%20Winothai"&gt;Teeratep Winothai&lt;/a&gt; forced a save out of Iraqi goalkeeper &lt;a href="w%3ANoor%20Hassan"&gt;Noor Hassan&lt;/a&gt; with an effort from outside the &lt;a href="w%3APenalty%20box"&gt;penalty box&lt;/a&gt; five minutes from the end. 

The game ended at 1-1, however, and means both Thailand and Iraq move to one point each in the Group A ladder after one match played. &lt;a href="w%3AOman%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Oman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia%20national%20football%20%28soccer%29%20team"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; are the other two teams in the goup. Australia will make their Asian Cup debut later today after moving from the &lt;a href="w%3AOceania%20Football%20Confederation"&gt;Oceania Confederation&lt;/a&gt; to the AFC at the start of 2006.

The Australians are considered favourites, along with defending champions &lt;a href="w%3AJapan%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, to win the tournament in their first outing, following their impressive show in the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup"&gt;2006 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt;. They reached the second round after qualifying from Group F, including a 3-1 win over Japan, before losing by the single goal - an &lt;a href="w%3AInjury%20time"&gt;injury time&lt;/a&gt; penalty - to eventual champions &lt;a href="w%3AItaly%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>UN calls on international community to increase aid for Iraqi refugees</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=UN%20calls%20on%20international%20community%20to%20increase%20aid%20for%20Iraqi%20refugees&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20High%20Commissioner%20for%20Refugees"&gt;United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (UNHCR) called on the international community to increase aid and assistance to the two countries shouldering the bulk of displaced &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;is. &lt;a href="Syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Jordan"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt; have received the largest number of Iraqi &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARefugee"&gt;refugees&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and are having difficulty coping with the numbers. 

The appeal was made by UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond at a press conference on Friday at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APalais%20des%20Nations"&gt;Palais des Nations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeneva"&gt;Geneva&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Switzerland"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;. He criticized governments for earlier expressing concern and pledging support for the refugees but not following through on promises. "Syria and Jordan have still received next to nothing in bilateral help from the world community," said Redmond.

There are an estimated 2 million Iraqi refugees total in Syria and Jordan with the numbers increasing daily. Each day, Syria receives approximately 2,000 Iraqis and, of those, about 1,000 will stay for an extended time. There are a further 2 million displaced Iraqis who move and settle in safer areas within Iraq.

The large numbers of refugees is putting pressure on the infrastructure of the host countries, resulting in difficult living conditions for the inhabitants. Ron Redmond acknowledges that some US$70 million in donations have been received by the UNHCR, and a further $10 million promised since the Iraq displacement conference in April, 2007. He points out, however, that much more is required. "We stressed then and we say it again, donors must provide direct bilateral support to these host countries whose schools, hospitals, public services and infrastructure are seriously overstretched because of the presence of millions of Iraqis they have so generously welcomed," said Redmond.
Schools are particularly difficult to set up and staff in a refugee situation. Syria has currently hundreds of thousands of Iraqi refugee children, but only has resources for 32,000 students. Syria offers free access to public schools for refugees, but doesn't have the infrastructure to cope. Some 14,000 Iraqi refugee children in Jordan attend school, out of the possible 250,000. The refugee children in Jordan don't have access to public schools and instead go to private schools. UNHCR is partnering with UNICEF to provide 150,000 classroom spots in Syria, Jordan and Lebanon, but the coordination of the required resources, such as buildings, teachers, and school supplies is proving difficult.

Health issues for the refugees is also a concern. UNHCR has set up three primary care medical facilities in Syria, with two more in the works. But approximately 10,000 Iraqis per month require a doctor's attention, 3,000 of which require serious medical treatment.
"It is unconscionable that generous host countries be left on their own to deal with such a huge crisis," said Ron Redmond at the press conference. "We strongly urge governments to step forward now to support them in dealing with this situation and renew our call for international solidarity and burden sharing."

The president of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARefugees%20International"&gt;Refugees International&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Ken Bacon, agrees that a more comprehensive approach to the situation is required and believes that it would be good investment for the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; to increase its aid to the region. "The United States ought to be pumping money into Jordan and Syria," Bacon suggests. He feels that the sheer numbers of refugees can have a destabilizing influence in the &lt;a href="Middle%20East"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt;. However, the complicated diplomatic relationship between the U.S. and Syria has resulted in slow progress, according to Bacon, as bilateral discussions have not taken place and the UN is forced to mediate.

<h3>Jordan and Syria impose restrictions on refugees</h3>

Both Jordan and Syria have put in place new entry and residency conditions, which has resulted in thousands of refugees being stranded on Iraq's borders. Families have been separated based on a person's age and type of passport held. Jordan and Syria have not signed on to the UN &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AConvention%20Relating%20to%20the%20Status%20of%20Refugees"&gt;Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The non-governmental organization &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHuman%20Rights%20Watch"&gt;Human Rights Watch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has been critical of Jordan and Syria on their policy of returning refugees, saying they "are violating on a daily basis the most fundamental principle of refugee protection – &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANon-refoulement"&gt;nonrefoulement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which prohibits the return of refugees to persecution or serious harm."

To gain access to Jordan, Iraqi refugees must be over 40 or under 20, and must prove they have sufficient funds to support themselves in the country. They must also be in possession of a new generation passport.

Nasser Hikmat Jaafar drove 900 km from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with his family to reach Jordan in mid-June, 2007. Half of his family was refused entry to Jordan. "They allowed entry just for my wife and two daughters and denied me and my three sons. They didn't tell us the reasons, but just said they are fed up with men of such ages [between 20 and 40 years old]," said Jaafar. He changed plans and traveled with all his family to the Syrian border, a distance of approximately 500 km from Iraq's Jordanian border.

Syria has less restrictions on gaining entry, but has imposed residency conditions. Refugees can only stay up to three months and must then leave Syria and re-enter to be eligible to stay for another period.

<h3>United States Government resettlement program</h3>

The United States government has a program set up for Iraqi asylum seekers in Jordan who meet specific criteria. If they meet the requirements, listed below, they may be eligible for resettlement under the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAsylum%20in%20the%20United%20States"&gt;United States Refugee Admissions Program&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (USRAP).

Interested asylum seekers are encouraged to apply directly with the U.S. Overseas Processing Entity (OPE) in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAmman"&gt;Amman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Jordan, which is operated by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Organization%20for%20Migration"&gt;International Organization for Migration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (IOM). Individual Iraqis and their immediate family that meet one of the conditions below may seek access through the direct program:

<ul>
BULLET::::- Individuals who worked on a full-time basis as interpreters/translators for the U.S. Government or Multi-National Forces (MNF-I);
BULLET::::- Locally Employed Staff (LES) engaged by the U.S. Government under the authority of the Chief of Mission or the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA); or
BULLET::::- Surviving immediate family members of interpreters/translators or LES.

</ul>
According to the U.S. government information on the process, those individuals initiating a case with the OPE will not be guaranteed an interview for resettlement in the United States. Applicants would be screened for eligibility as per the requirements listed above and are subject to approval. 

In a February 14, 2007 press briefing, U.S. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnder%20Secretary%20for%20Democracy%20and%20Global%20Affairs"&gt;Under Secretary for Democracy and Global Affairs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APaula%20Dobriansky"&gt;Paula J. Dobriansky&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; addressed the Iraq refugee crisis. "Our key immediate objectives are to assist internally displaced Iraqis and Iraqi refugees by building up the capacities of UN agencies and NGOs," said Dobriansky. "This includes increasing opportunities for permanent resettlement for the most vulnerable Iraqis, to establish specialized programs to assist Iraqis who are at risk because of their employment or close association with the United States Government, to work diplomatically with regional governments through bilateral and multilateral channels to uphold the principle of first asylum," she continued.

In the February press briefing, the U.S. committed to receive 7,000 Iraqi refugees by fiscal year end, September 30, but clarified that perhaps only half that number would be "travel-ready" subsequent to the interview process as described above. The U.S. could accommodate 20,000 to 30,000 Iraqi refugees per year without difficulty, according to Ken Bacon of Refugees International.

To date, the U.S. has allowed 750 Iraqi refugees into the country.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALondon%2C%20England"&gt;London, England&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
For the second time in two days, the sun and the crowds came out to welcome the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Tour%20de%20France"&gt;Tour de France&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;.

The winner, Australian &lt;a href="w%3ARobbie%20McEwan"&gt;Robbie McEwan&lt;/a&gt;, claimed the Green jersey while &lt;a href="w%3AFabian%20Cancellara"&gt;Fabian Cancellara&lt;/a&gt; held onto the leaders yellow jersey.

Fellow Briton &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Cavendish"&gt;Mark Cavendish&lt;/a&gt; suffered bike troubles throughout the whole stage. Millar did not go without, he was awarded the polka dot jersey for king of the mountains.

<h2>Atmosphere at Jubilee Gardens</h2>
 The show got underway as the &lt;a href="w%3ATour_de_France%23Culture"&gt;caravane&lt;/a&gt; set off from the Mall at half eight. Dance beats, giant cows, and &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; tinged words of encouragement, momentarily woke the early birds from their patient wait for the main event. As they waited curious by-passers swapped photography tips, and thoughts on cycling as the youngest members wondered what the fuss was all about. Council workmen commented on how easy it was to get work done, with no car traffic on the roads.

Again the policing was low key and friendly with the Gendarme Nationale cutting a dash amongst their &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; colleagues. British bobbies rode in French vehicles, and French argents in British ones. Riding well in advance of the Tour, French and British motorcycle policemen swapped tips and compared notes as they passed. The Frenchmen bringing more than a little Gallic charm and swagger to the proceedings.

The crowd behind &lt;a href="w%3AJubilee%20Gardens%2C%20South%20Bank"&gt;Jubilee Gardens&lt;/a&gt; grew as the start time of twenty-five past ten approached, an event presaged by an ever increasing number of press and support vehicles. As &lt;a href="w%3AClock%20Tower%2C%20Palace%20of%20Westminster"&gt;Big Ben&lt;/a&gt; chimed the hour in the background a quartet of helicopters in the sky above the River Thames began to jostle for position; a dance mirrored on the ground as anticipation grew. Slowly the dribble that was the vanguard of press and support vehicles became a torrent. A wave of cheers rung out, announcing finally the arrival of the riders. Despite their being almost 190 riders the speeding cyclists had come and gone in a matter of minutes, however the show was not yet over. For a quarter of an hour afterwards tour buses, and still yet more support vehicles followed in the wake of the cyclists. As the police began to remove their restrictions on the crowds and traffic, a final rear guard of race fans emulating their heroes brought up the rear. Despite some not being in the best of condition and some riding rather rickety bikes, these fans still managed to get an enthusiastic cheer of encouragement from the remaining onlookers.

With the Tour continuing on its way and it still not yet 11, some amongst the myriad of spectators began to make their way to the large outside video screens to continue watching the race, others preferring to sample the shops, sights, smells and tastes of the waking City. With some others choosing to sit in the sun, and lie in the park, no doubt making up for an early start.

Police officers and government officials met on Friday in &lt;a href="Morocco"&gt;Morocco&lt;/a&gt; and say that a "serious threat of a terrorist act" by &lt;a href="al-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; exists in the country and has raised their terrorist attack threat level to "maximum."

"[Intelligence] indicates a serious threat of a terrorist act and demands extreme mobilization by the bodies concerned," said a statement by Morocco's interior Ministry. The statement did not cite specific targets or dates. The statement also said that "reliable intelligence information" exists to issue the alert.

"Reliable information relayed in recent days to the interior ministry described the preparation of acts of terrorism in Morocco. Morocco is cooperating fully with foreign police services,” the source said, adding that in the face of the threat, Morocco is putting itself in a situation of extreme vigilance," said an unnamed security official in Morocco.

Prior to raising the level, &lt;a href="w%3ANicolas%20Sarkozy"&gt;Nicolas Sarkozy&lt;/a&gt;, the newly elected president of &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, was scheduled to visit the country, but those plans have since been canceled citing "scheduling reasons," said David Martinon, a spokesman for Sarkozy. Martinon did not state that security concerns played a role in canceling the trip.

The triumphant &lt;a href="w%3ALewis%20Hamilton"&gt;Lewis Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;, who won the &lt;a href="w%3Apole%20position"&gt;pole&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="Lewis%20Hamilton%20on%20top%20for%202007%20British%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;qualification yesterday&lt;/a&gt; was able to maintain his position on the first part of the race, but lose it on his first pit-stop. Moreover, his teammate for &lt;a href="w%3ATeam%20McLaren"&gt;McLaren&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3AMercedes-Benz"&gt;Mercedes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFernando%20Alonso"&gt;Fernando Alonso&lt;/a&gt; passed Kimi in the same way while Finn was on his first pit-stop and was in the lead before the Spaniard's second pit-stop. After McLaren drivers refuel themselves just a few very fast laps became decisive to secure Kimi's podium. Lewis was unable to overtake Fernando thus finishing third.

Another Ferrari driver &lt;a href="w%3AFelipe%20Massa"&gt;Felipe Massa&lt;/a&gt; had a problem on the start causing him to start from the pit-lane, but broke through to the fifth place, finishing right on the back of &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Kubica"&gt;Robert Kubica&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3ABMW%20Sauber"&gt;BMW Sauber&lt;/a&gt;. Felipe was pushing on the Poland driver through the whole third part of the race.

With the 6th place of &lt;a href="w%3ANick%20Heidfeld"&gt;Nick Heidfeld&lt;/a&gt;, another BMW driver, the BMW Sauber team once again overtook &lt;a href="w%3ARenault%20F1"&gt;Renault&lt;/a&gt; drivers. 

Both &lt;a href="w%3AHeikki%20Kovalainen"&gt;Heikki Kovalainen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGiancarlo%20Fisichella"&gt;Giancarlo Fisichella&lt;/a&gt; were the first in one lap behind the leaders closing the top eight.

&lt;a href="w%3AHonda%20Racing%20F1"&gt;Honda&lt;/a&gt; drivers finished 9th and 10th.

This race became the 9th consecutive podium finish for Lewis Hamilton in his rookie season who is leading the Drivers' Championship with 70 pts, 12 ahead of Alonso.

<h1>Boeing unveils new 787 Dreamliner</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Boeing%20unveils%20new%20787%20Dreamliner&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
Aircraft manufacturer &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing"&gt;Boeing&lt;/a&gt; have unveiled their new &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20787"&gt;787 Dreamliner&lt;/a&gt; at their &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20Everett%20Factory"&gt;Everett Factory&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href="w%3ASeattle%2C%20Washington"&gt;Seattle, Washington&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. Sunday was chosen as its date matches the aircraft's designation number when written in the American format, 7/8/07.

The event was attended by 15,000 people including employees, customers, suppliers and officials from government and the local community. 

Scott Carson, president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes said, "This has been a wonderful and exciting day to celebrate this breakthrough airplane with our customers, employees, supplier partners and our communities."

The mid-sized 787 will seat between 210 and 330 passengers, and will be the first commercial airliner of a mostly &lt;a href="w%3Acarbon%20fibre"&gt;carbon fibre&lt;/a&gt; composites construction. Boeing claims that the resulting reduction of weight compared to the traditional &lt;a href="w%3Aaluminium"&gt;aluminium&lt;/a&gt; will offer enhanced fuel efficiency, benefiting both operators and the environment. According to the company, the 787 Dreamliner will use 20 percent less fuel per passenger than similarly sized aircraft.

On Saturday, Boeing announced 35 new orders from &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; airline &lt;a href="w%3AAir%20Berlin"&gt;Air Berlin&lt;/a&gt; and ALAFCO Aviation Lease &amp; Finance of &lt;a href="w%3AKuwait"&gt;Kuwait&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the total to 677 orders from 47 customers. At the list price, these orders are worth &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;5.62 billion.

The first flight is expected to take place in August or September of this year, with the first customer, &lt;a href="w%3AAll%20Nippon%20Airways"&gt;All Nippon Airways&lt;/a&gt;, due to receive their first aircraft in May 2008.

The 787 illustrates the differing strategies adopted by Boeing and &lt;a href="w%3AAirbus"&gt;Airbus&lt;/a&gt; whose double-decker &lt;a href="w%3AAirbus%20A380"&gt;A380&lt;/a&gt; first flew in April 2005 and is expected to enter service later this year. Whereas the Airbus A380 is aimed at flying large passenger numbers between major hubs, the Dreamliner is targeted at smaller airports where Boeing predicts will be an area of growth in the industry.

Earlier in the day, Boeing received a congratulatory letter from Airbus. The company president and CEO &lt;a href="w%3ALouis%20Gallois"&gt;Louis Gallois&lt;/a&gt; said, "Today is a great day in aviation history. For, whenever such a milestone is reached in our industry, it always is a reflection of hard work by dedicated people inspired by the wonder of flight. Even if tomorrow Airbus will get back to the business of competing vigorously, today is Boeing's day -- a day to celebrate the 787."

The fire threatened homes, businesses and a power substation. Lightning strikes are believed to have started the blaze.

Since last Tuesday, following violent confrontations with Pakistan's army, up to 1800 clerics and students are still holed up in Islamabad's &lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Mosque"&gt;Red Mosque&lt;/a&gt;. Clashes began last week following mounting antagonism between the mosques hard-line leaders and the government lead by President Pervez Musharraf. 

The mosque has been accused of enforcing its own Islamic law in the capital, notably the illegal detention of Chinese foreign nationals working in massage parlors.

20 people have been reported killed over the past six days, which have seen multiple gun battles and demolition of the mosques exterior walls. Currently, there seems little chance of a negotiated resolution. A delegation of Islamic leaders were refused access, and the mosques leader Abdul Rashid Ghazi has declared suicide a favourable option to surrender.

The mosques leaders follow the &lt;a href="w%3AHanafi"&gt;Hanafi&lt;/a&gt; school of thought, believing that the Koran is the authority by which justice should be metered. Historically the mosque has had close links with the Pakistan leadership, and members of the current administration have resisted calls for a crackdown on the mosques provocative behaviour.

The stand-off represents a decisive ideological challenge to the president who is walking a fine-line between Islamic extremists at home and foreign pressure to crack-down on militancy in the lawless tribal regions.

<h1>AFC Asian Cup: Australia draw with Oman, hosts Vietnam upset UAE</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=AFC%20Asian%20Cup%3A%20Australia%20draw%20with%20Oman%2C%20hosts%20Vietnam%20upset%20UAE&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Tournament favourites and debutants &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia%20national%20football%20%28soccer%29%20team"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; have drawn 1-1 with a skillful &lt;a href="w%3AOman%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Oman&lt;/a&gt; in the second match in Group A of the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20AFC%20Asian%20Cup"&gt;2007 AFC Asian Cup&lt;/a&gt;. 

Oman shocked the Socceroos when they scored on thirty-two minutes, after some enterprising play on their left-hand flank. A ball cut back made its' way through the Australian defence to Omani striker Badar Mubarak, who slotted the ball low into the left-hand corner of the goal.

Oman very nearly had a second goal on three separate occasions in the second half. They were only denied by three world-class saves by Australian goalkeeper &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Schwarzer"&gt;Mark Schwarzer&lt;/a&gt;, including a low save from a driving volley by &lt;a href="w%3AAhmed%20Mubarak"&gt;Ahmed Mubarak&lt;/a&gt;, a reflex save to stop a point-blank header in the seventieth minute, and then another low-down save minutes later from Fawi Bashir's driving shot.

A heavy downpour began ten minutes prior to the final whistle, and it appeared to reinvigorate Australia. They pressed forward in numbers, and were rewarded in injury time with a goal to &lt;a href="w%3AEverton%20FC"&gt;Everton&lt;/a&gt; midfielder &lt;a href="w%3ATim%20Cahill"&gt;Tim Cahill&lt;/a&gt;, after a low volley by &lt;a href="w%3AMarco%20Bresciano"&gt;Marco Bresciano&lt;/a&gt; was well-saved by Omani keeper Suleiman Al Mazroui.

Cahill achieved the remarkable double of scoring both Australia's first Asian Cup and World Cup goals, after he scored in the eighty-third minute of their match against &lt;a href="w%3AJapan%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup"&gt;2006 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt;. He and &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Aloisi"&gt;John Aloisi&lt;/a&gt; capped off the comeback by scoring twice late to defeat Japan 3-1.

The Australian players were visibly frustrated by Oman's play-acting tactics, which saw the stretcher used four times in the first half alone. &lt;a href="England"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; match commentator &lt;a href="w%3ASimon%20Hill"&gt;Simon Hill&lt;/a&gt; described the tactics as "a blight to the game" and "absolutely rubbish", the latter in relation to one incident where no contact was made whatsoever. When queried about it after the game, Arnold said cynically "welcome to Asia".
The Australians were flat and their defending was poor, said coach &lt;a href="w%3AGraham%20Arnold"&gt;Graham Arnold&lt;/a&gt; at the post-match media conference. He also commented on goalkeeper Schwarzer's three fantastic saves, saying "Mark Schwarzer's got us out of jail. Schwarzer's made two unbelievable saves, otherwise it's 2-0 and all over".

The draw leaves all four Group A teams equal on the table on one point, with one goal for and one against, following &lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; 1-1 draw with hosts &lt;a href="w%3AThailand%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt; yesterday.

In the other game played yesterday (UTC), co-hosts &lt;a href="w%3AVietnam%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt; caused a major shock by defeating &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Arab%20Emirates%20national%20football%20team"&gt;United Arab Emirates&lt;/a&gt; in their Group B fixture.

The Emirates are the current &lt;a href="w%3AGulf%20Cup%20of%20Nations"&gt;Gulf Cup&lt;/a&gt; champions, and the hosts were expected to struggle to win this match, or progress from Group B which includes two-time Asian champions Japan and Asian Games gold medallists Qatar. Vietnam is playing at Asian Cup level for the first time in nearly half a century.

UAE had the better of the chances in an otherwise-even first half, with the best &lt;a href="w%3AFaisal%20Khalil"&gt;Faisal Khalil&lt;/a&gt;'s shot in the thirtieth minute, which was well-saved by Vietnamese goalkeeper Duong Hong Son who managed to turn the ball around the post for a corner.

However, they scored two second half goals to take the three points from the &lt;a href="w%3AMy%20Dinh%20National%20Stadium"&gt;My Dinh National Stadium&lt;/a&gt;. On sixty-three minutes, a counter-attack from the half-way line involving three Vietnamese players resulted in defender &lt;a href="w%3AHuynh%20Quang%20Thanh"&gt;Huynh Quang Thanh&lt;/a&gt; putting the ball in the back of the net.

Vietnamese player of the year &lt;a href="w%3ALe%20Cong%20Vinh"&gt;Le Cong Vinh&lt;/a&gt; made it 2-0 nine minutes later when he chased down a long ball and calmly lobbed it over Emirates goalkeeper Majed Nasser, who had come off his line to try and avert the danger.

&lt;a href="w%3ABruno%20Metsu"&gt;Bruno Metsu&lt;/a&gt;, coach of the United Arab Emirates, substituted players and launched an all-out attack to try and salvage something, but failed to find the goals he needed.

World number one in &lt;a href="tennis"&gt;tennis&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Roger%20Federer"&gt;Roger Federer&lt;/a&gt; has defeated &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spaniard&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Rafael%20Nadal"&gt;Rafael Nadal&lt;/a&gt; to win his fifth consecutive &lt;a href="Wimbledon%20Championships"&gt;Wimbledon&lt;/a&gt; mens single title.

The 25-year-old Swiss maestro overcame the second-seeded Nadal in five sets, 7-6, 4-6, 7-6, 2-6, 6-2. The final took 3 hours and 45 minutes to complete.

Federer, who lost to Nadal in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2007%20French%20Open"&gt;2007 French Open&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; final less than a month ago, equalled &lt;a href="Sweden"&gt;Swede&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABj%C3%B6rn%20Borg"&gt;Bjorn Borg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's record of five straight Wimbledon titles. Borg was men singles champions at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAll%20England%20Lawn%20Tennis%20and%20Croquet%20Club"&gt;All England Club&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; between 1976 and 1980. Borg attended the match and met with Federer afterwards to offer his congratulations.

The match was very evenly contested throughout all five sets. Federer won the first set in a tiebreak, 9-7, which featured a series of uncharacteristic errors from both players. Both players had broken each other early in the first set.

Federer was in trouble on serve twice in the second set. He managed to recover from 15-40 down in the sixth game with three successive aces - Federer ended up serving 24 aces in the match to Nadal's one. However, he couldn't repeat the effort in the tenth game, and Nadal broke to close the set out 6-4.

The third set went on serve for all twelve games, with no breaks leaving the score at 6-all. Federer won the tiebreak 7-3.

The fourth set was entirely different again. Nadal charged out to a 4-0 lead, aided by the assistance of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHawk-Eye"&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; appeals system. Federer, who has been an outspoken critic of the technology, snapped at the end of the third game after a Nadal ball was called 'out' but overturned after Hawkeye revealed that 2 mm of the ball had touched the back of the line. "How in the world was that ball in? ... Look at the score now. This system is killing me," he said in the direction of the umpire. Nadal went on to win the set 6-2 with no further breaks of serve.

The players entered the final set, the first for Federer in his five-year reign as Wimbledon champion, and the defending champion had to scrap to save his first two service games. Down 15-40 in both, he managed to hold on, and it appeared to deflate Nadal. Nadal was then broken by Federer - his first break since the first set - in the sixth game to lead 4-2, with Federer producing some high-quality shots to break the serve. He held serve to love to lead 5-2, and then broke Nadal on his second match point to win the final. 

The match was the third-longest men's final, at 3 hours 45 minutes, in the history of the Wimbledon championships. Federer has now won eleven Grand Slam titles, and has a record of 11-2 in Grand Slam finals. The two losses were both against Nadal and both at the French Open, the only one of the four Grand Slams he is yet to win.

<h1>Rower Tuijn halfway across Pacific in record attempt</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Rower%20Tuijn%20halfway%20across%20Pacific%20in%20record%20attempt&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt; adventurer &lt;a href="w%3ARalph%20Tuijn"&gt;Ralph Tuijn&lt;/a&gt; has reached the halfway point of his attempt to be the first person to row across the &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Ocean"&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt; unaided.

The 16,000 kilometre journey from the coast of &lt;a href="Peru"&gt;Peru&lt;/a&gt; to the seaside city of &lt;a href="w%3ABrisbane"&gt;Brisbane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, the widest section of the Pacific, has never been crossed absolutely unaided by a rower, and Tuijn says just nine people have rowed it even with assistance.

Tuijn reached the central point of his crossing, an insignificant point of water in the ocean, 111 days after setting off from Peru in March. He has been making good progress, and has since cut his estimated time of arrival in Brisbane by a month.

The Dutchman, who now expects to reach his destination on October 20, has kept in touch with those tracking his movements through daily internet postings from his laptop computer, including his wife Winnie. His boat, the ♡❤Zeeman Challenger♡❤, is a seven-metre custom &lt;a href="w%3Aplywood"&gt;plywood&lt;/a&gt; vessel.

Tuijn has overcome a variety of obstacles to reach the halfway point. He is suffering from the constant attention of sharks, who often bump his boat and disrupt his attempts at sleep. One particular shark, dubbed 'Gomulka' by Tuijn, has been trailing the adventurer's boat for extended periods.

He has also accidentally burnt himself when he spilled hot water on his foot whilst trying to make coffee, apparently also from a shark 'bump'. He is also forced to manually pump water for cooking and drinking after his automatic water pump broke down not long into his journey.
His vessel has no motors or sails, but relies on his physical rowing power to move. The boat does have a solar power system to provide energy for his laptop, a telephone and a &lt;a href="w%3Aglobal%20positioning%20system"&gt;global positioning system&lt;/a&gt;.

Tujin, who is raising money for a children's home in &lt;a href="w%3AMumbai"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, is rowing at an average speed of 58 kilometres each day. His diet consists of freeze-dried foods and fish, which are keeping him physically well-conditioned despite tiring mentally.

Tuijn is a serial adventurer and experienced rower. He has rowed across the &lt;a href="w%3AAtlantic%20Ocean"&gt;Atlantic Ocean&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Sea"&gt;North Sea&lt;/a&gt;, as well as cycled across &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; and the icy terrain of &lt;a href="w%3AGreenland"&gt;Greenland&lt;/a&gt;.

An eighty-eighth minute goal has given &lt;a href="w%3AGulf%20Cup%20of%20Nations"&gt;Gulf Cup&lt;/a&gt; champions &lt;a href="w%3AQatar%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Qatar&lt;/a&gt; a 1-1 draw with &lt;a href="w%3AJapan%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; in their &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20AFC%20Asian%20Cup"&gt;2007 AFC Asian Cup&lt;/a&gt; Group B match at the &lt;a href="w%3AMy%20Dinh%20National%20Stadium"&gt;My Dinh National Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHanoi"&gt;Hanoi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Vietnam"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;.

Three-time champions and current defending champions of the Asian Cup competition, Japan scored in the sixty-first minute through prolific striker &lt;a href="w%3ANaohiro%20Takahara"&gt;Naohiro Takahara&lt;/a&gt;. They held the lead for nearly half an hour before &lt;a href="w%3ASebasti%C3%A1n%20Quintana"&gt;Sebastián Quintana&lt;/a&gt; levelled the scores at 1-1 for Qatar.

Japan's goal was the result of a clever finish by Takahara after getting on the end of a &lt;a href="w%3AYasuyuki%20Konno"&gt;Yasuyuki Konno&lt;/a&gt; cross from the left-hand wing. A series of passes around the edge of Qatar's penalty area ended up with a through-ball for Konno on the left, who precisely drilled his left-footed cross for Takahara to smartly strike on the half-turn into the net.

Japanese midfielder &lt;a href="w%3AYuki%20Abe"&gt;Yuki Abe&lt;/a&gt; fouled Quintana two metres outside the box, and Quintana sweetly struck the ball to the right of the defensive wall and past Japanese goalkeeper and captain &lt;a href="w%3AYoshikatsu%20Kawaguchi"&gt;Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi&lt;/a&gt; on eighty-eight minutes.

The drama-packed last few minutes included the goal as well as a straight &lt;a href="w%3ARed%20card%20%28sports%29"&gt;red card&lt;/a&gt; against Qatar defender &lt;a href="w%3AHussain%20Yasser"&gt;Hussain Yasser&lt;/a&gt; for a &lt;a href="w%3AMisconduct%20%28football%29%23Sending-off%20offences%20%28Red%20Card%29"&gt;reckless tackle&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n referee &lt;a href="w%3AMatthew%20Breeze"&gt;Matthew Breeze&lt;/a&gt; adjudged Yasser to have dangerously lunged at Japanese midfielder &lt;a href="w%3AHideo%20Hashimoto"&gt;Hideo Hashimoto&lt;/a&gt; with the studs showing, collecting him both late and above the ball, two minutes into &lt;a href="w%3AInjury%20time"&gt;injury time&lt;/a&gt;.

Qatar coach &lt;a href="w%3AD%C5%BEemaludin%20Mu%C5%A1ovi%C4%87"&gt;Džemaludin Mušović&lt;/a&gt; was sent away from the sideline by Breeze immediately following Yasser's dismissal, after overzealously protesting the referee's decision to send his player off. When Mušović initially failed to leave, the sideline-based fourth official intervened and he made his way to the grandstand.

The result leaves underdog hosts &lt;a href="w%3AVietnam%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt; on top of Group B after their upset victory over the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Arab%20Emirates%20national%20football%20team"&gt;United Arab Emirates&lt;/a&gt; yesterday.

<h3>Nigerian gunmen release British toddler</h3>

&lt;a href="Nigeria"&gt;Nigerian&lt;/a&gt; gunmen have released three-year-old Margaret Hill, after holding her captive for four days. The toddler has since been reunited with her parents. She is reportedly in good health but covered with mosquito bites and also hungry, having not eaten recently.

The kidnappers had threatened to kill the toddler unless a ransom was paid or Mr. Hill came to take her place. The family claims no ransom was paid for her freedom. She was kidnapped from her car on July 5, on her way to school. Her driver was stabbed trying to protect Margaret.

More than a ton of &lt;a href="w%3ATNT"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; stored illegally in the basement of a karaoke bar caused the recent explosion that killed 25 people and injured 41 more in the north-eastern &lt;a href="China"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; town of &lt;a href="w%3ATianshifu"&gt;Tianshifu&lt;/a&gt;, news reports say. 

Qu Yujie or Yijie (known locally as Qu Hua), owner of the two-storey Tianying Karaoke Hall and Bath House which was levelled by the blast was amongst those killed. He was described as "a successful businessman" who owned a local &lt;a href="w%3Acolliery"&gt;colliery&lt;/a&gt;. Many residents of Tianshifu, where the blast occurred stated that he regularly used the basement of the building as a storage site for his explosives. His elder brother and his elder brother's wife were also among the deceased according to &lt;a href="w%3ABenxi"&gt;Benxi&lt;/a&gt; county government spokesman Fu Qingbin. 

As part of a short statement regarding investigative results made available to state news agency ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AXinhua"&gt;Xinhua&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ on Sunday, the following conclusion as in to the cause of the disaster was given: "After more than three days' efforts, we found self-ignition of the explosives led to the explosion,".

Reports state that there were many students celebrating the end of exams at the bar when the explosion occurred - eight teenage girls who were part of a group of 13 from a local department store celebrating a the 19th birthday of Sun Bo, including Bo herself, and several pedestrians outside the building were amongst the casualties of the disaster. The drivers of a truck and a motorcycle passing the building when it exploded were also killed, as were a couple who owned a car wash near to the site. The explosion also buried a number of cars under tons of concrete and blew out windows in nearby buildings.

Police estimated that over a ton of TNT was required given the force of the explosion, and noted that the explosives had been manufactured by a factory in the local area. This was backed up by the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABeijing%20News"&gt;Beijing News&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ quoting an investigator as saying "The explosion was so powerful that there must have been about one tonne of explosives,". 

The coal mine the explosives were intended for is one of around 3-400 in the local area, which operate both legally with licences and illegally without. &lt;a href="w%3Adetonator"&gt;Detonator&lt;/a&gt;s were also recovered from &lt;a href="w%3Aground%20zero"&gt;ground zero&lt;/a&gt;.

Relatives of the deceased are currently being put up at local hotels in preparation for compensation discusions with the authorities. Of the 41 injured survivors, all are still being treated in local hospitals, four with "serious injuries" and the remaining 37 with "fractures, chest injuries and broken ribs", according to one &lt;a href="w%3Aphysician"&gt;physician&lt;/a&gt;. One person suffered injuries of a severity that required him to be taken to the &lt;a href="w%3ABenxi%20City"&gt;Benxi City&lt;/a&gt; Central Hospital, while the rest are in either Benxi County No. 1 hospital or at a hospital in Tianshifu itself, according to deputy director of the Benxi County Health Bureau Jiang Yongcheng. A dozen extra medical experts have also gone to Benxi County to help treat the victims.

&lt;a href="Belgium"&gt;Belgian&lt;/a&gt; riders, &lt;a href="w%3AGert%20Steegmans"&gt;Gert Steegmans&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Boonen"&gt;Tom Boonen&lt;/a&gt;, finished one-two in stage 2 of the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Tour%20de%20France"&gt;2007 Tour de France&lt;/a&gt; that ran mostly in their home country.

Starting in &lt;a href="w%3ADunkirk"&gt;Dunkirk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, and ending in &lt;a href="w%3AGhent"&gt;Ghent&lt;/a&gt;, Belgium, the 168.5 &lt;a href="w%3AKilometre"&gt;km&lt;/a&gt; (104.7 &lt;a href="w%3AMile"&gt;mile&lt;/a&gt;) stage is considered a flat stage. The roads were wet with rain today.

"What an explosion of emotion it was after the finish," Steegmans said. "It was really important for the team. You could feel this enormous pressure because we're a Belgian team." Boonen thought that the picture of the photo finish in Ghent was "the most beautiful picture of the year."

Steegmans and Boonen are not only countrymen, but also team-mates on the Belgian-sponsored &lt;a href="w%3AQuick%20Step-Innergetic"&gt;Quick Step-Innergetic&lt;/a&gt; team. Boonen took the green jersey from &lt;a href="w%3ARobbie%20McEwen"&gt;Robbie McEwen&lt;/a&gt;, who came in sixth.

There was a large crash with less than 3 km to the finish. A cyclist from the team &lt;a href="w%3ATeam%20Milram"&gt;Milram&lt;/a&gt; hit the wheel of Tom Boonen and fell, dragging everyone behind him into his fall. &lt;a href="Switzerland"&gt;Swiss&lt;/a&gt; rider &lt;a href="w%3AFabian%20Cancellara"&gt;Fabian Cancellara&lt;/a&gt; was involved in the crash, but maintained the overall lead. The overall consequences were limited: &lt;a href="w%3ATomas%20Vaitkus"&gt;Tomas Vaitkus&lt;/a&gt; broke his thumb, &lt;a href="w%3AFred%20Rodriguez"&gt;Fred Rodriguez&lt;/a&gt; sustained several rib fractures.

After 18 km in the race, &lt;a href="w%3AMarcel%20Sieberg"&gt;Marcel Sieberg&lt;/a&gt; (Milram), &lt;a href="w%3ARuben%20Perez"&gt;Ruben Perez&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AEuskaltel-Euskadi"&gt;Euskaltel&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href="w%3AC%C3%A9dric%20Herve"&gt;Cédric Herve&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AAgritubel"&gt;Agritubel&lt;/a&gt;) escaped and took the lead and soon rode five minutes before the peleton, but 3 km before the finish the trio was caught again.

<h1>Political pundits debate Fred Thompson's younger wife</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Political%20pundits%20debate%20Fred%20Thompson%27s%20younger%20wife&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Political analysts widely regard &lt;a href="w%3AFred%20Thompson"&gt;Fred Thompson&lt;/a&gt; as a potential, if not likely, candidate in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202008"&gt;United States presidential election in 2008&lt;/a&gt;. Thompson is a lawyer, lobbyist, character actor and former &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;Senator&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="Tennessee"&gt;Tennessee&lt;/a&gt; now residing in McLean, &lt;a href="Virginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20D.C."&gt;Washington D.C.&lt;/a&gt;

A recent article in ♡❤The New York Times♡❤ (NYT) labelled his wife, &lt;a href="w%3AJeri%20Kehn%20Thompson"&gt;Jeri Kehn Thompson&lt;/a&gt; as a "&lt;a href="w%3Atrophy%20wife"&gt;trophy wife&lt;/a&gt;" and a potential liability in the 2008 race. The NYT article described her as having "youthfulness, permanent tan and bleached blonde hair" and wonders if "so-called values voters" would "accept this union." 

Thompson and Kehn, married in June 2002, when he was 60 years old and she 35. 

Television commentator and former Republican congressman &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Scarborough"&gt;Joe Scarborough&lt;/a&gt; compared Kehn to a stripper and asked if "she works the pole." 

According to the ♡❤Associated Press♡❤, "trophy wife" originally "meant the second (or third) wife of a corporate titan, a woman who was younger, beautiful and — equally important — accomplished in her own right."

♡❤ABC News♡❤ says that the current definition of "trophy wife" suggests &lt;a href="w%3ADonald%20Trump"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;'s ex-wife &lt;a href="w%3AMarla%20Maples"&gt;Marla Maples&lt;/a&gt; and the late &lt;a href="w%3AAnna%20Nicole%20Smith"&gt;Anna Nicole Smith&lt;/a&gt; as examples.

However, ♡❤ABC News♡❤ also questions whether Kehn fits this definition. "Though she's blond, beautiful and nearly 25 years younger than her husband, Kehn Thompson, a political media consultant who previously worked for the Senate Republican Conference and a prestigious Washington law firm, doesn't appear to fit the typical description," wrote Emily Friedman.

Karen O'Connor, a political scientist and the director of the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20University"&gt;Women &amp; Politics Institute at American University&lt;/a&gt;, said Thompson may lose support from Republican women, a group he needs. It may also make it difficult to gain the support of the "value voters", already skeptical after the report that he lobbied for an abortion-rights group.

"You have a situation where a candidate happens to have an attractive wife, therefore it’s open season for smutty thoughts and lowbrow humor, and no concern for the fact that this is a wife and mother, a professional woman?" said Mark Corallo, a former &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice"&gt;Justice Department&lt;/a&gt; official who is a consultant and the chief media adviser to the Thompson campaign. "One picture on the Internet and all of a sudden she’s reduced to being a bimbo?"

After failed last-minute negotiations, &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;i troops have moved in to end the nearly one-week standoff at the &lt;a href="w%3ALal%20Masjid"&gt;Lal Masjid&lt;/a&gt; (Red Mosque) in &lt;a href="w%3AIslamabad"&gt;Islamabad&lt;/a&gt;. There have been reports of an initial round of explosions early Tuesday morning (4:00 a.m. local time) followed by sounds of ongoing gunfire. As many as 1,800 clerics and followers had remained in the mosque.

"The militants are using small arms and grenades," said Major-General Waheed Arshad, a Pakistani military spokesman. "They are in the basement, we have covered the rooftop." According to Major-General Arshad, five Pakistani troops had been wounded in the military incursion. He expected the operation to be wrapped up in three or four hours.

Up until the latest military procedure, as many as 21 people had been killed in violence related to the standoff, which began a week ago when Pakistani forces first moved on the mosque.

Tensions had been rising between mosque clerics and the Pakistani government for the past few months as militants at the mosque led a movement, in Islamabad, pushing for implementation of sharia law. Tensions reached a peak when students of the mosque detained seven &lt;a href="China"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; nationals that they alleged had been working in brothels.

Several people, including former prime minister &lt;a href="w%3AChaudhry%20Shujaat%20Hussain"&gt;Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain&lt;/a&gt;, intervened and tried to broker a deal to end the standoff. "I am returning very disappointed," said Hussain on his return from the mosque.

At least 50 militants and eight soldiers have been killed or injured as result of the military offensive. &lt;a href="w%3AAbdul%20Rashid%20Ghazi"&gt;Abdul Rashid Ghazi&lt;/a&gt;'s body has been found, according to interior ministry spokesperson, Javed Iqbal Cheema.

&lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; technicians are beginning final launch preparations on the &lt;a href="w%3APhoenix%20%28spacecraft%29"&gt;Phoenix Mars Lander spacecraft&lt;/a&gt; destined for the planet &lt;a href="w%3AMars"&gt;Mars&lt;/a&gt;. The unmanned spacecraft is scheduled to launch from &lt;a href="w%3ACape%20Canaveral%20Air%20Force%20Station"&gt;Cape Canaveral Air Force Station&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="w%3AFlorida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;'s east coast on August 3, at around 5:35 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Time%20Zone%20%28North%20America%29"&gt;EST&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC-4"&gt;9.35 UTC&lt;/a&gt;). Phoenix will land in the Red Planet's northern &lt;a href="w%3APolar%20ice%20cap"&gt;polar region&lt;/a&gt; to search for signs of life, and analyze the Martian climate from a polar perspective. 

The launch period for Phoenix extends from August 3, 2007 until August 24, 2007 and consists of two launch windows per day. A &lt;a href="w%3ADelta%20II"&gt;Delta II&lt;/a&gt; rocket will carry the spacecraft into Earth's orbit to begin its 122 million &lt;a href="w%3Amile"&gt;mile&lt;/a&gt; journey to Mars. 

The journey is expected to last about 9 months, ending around May 28 at a landing site called &lt;a href="w%3AVastitas%20Borealis"&gt;Vastitas Borealis&lt;/a&gt; in the northern Arctic plains region of Mars. The site was identified in 2002 by the &lt;a href="w%3A2001%20Mars%20Odyssey"&gt;Mars Odyssey&lt;/a&gt; orbiter as having large amounts of water ice just below the surface. The high concentration is necessary to ensure that Phoenix will find water ice within reach of its instruments after landing. 

Phoenix will remain on the surface of Mars for about 92 Earth days examining the water ice expected to lie a few inches beneath the rocky surface. The lander contains instruments that will help scientists to determine if life as we know it has ever existed, or currently exists, on this barren planet. The lander will study the atmosphere, surface and subsurface to determine if the Martian Arctic soil could have ever supported life. A detailed analysis of the weather will help scientists determine the Martian climate as well as aid in planning future un-manned and eventually manned missions to our planetary neighbor.

At least five people have been killed, and several others injured, after a &lt;a href="w%3ACessna%20310"&gt;Cessna 310&lt;/a&gt; crashed into a neighborhood in &lt;a href="w%3ASanford%2C%20Florida"&gt;Sanford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. Two people on the plane and three others on the ground were reported to be killed in the crash.

The plane was attempting to make an emergency landing at the &lt;a href="w%3AOrlando-Sanford%20International%20Airport"&gt;Orlando-Sanford International Airport&lt;/a&gt; when it crashed into two houses, causing a massive fire. The aircraft is registered to Competitor Liaison Bureau Inc. of &lt;a href="w%3ADaytona%20Beach%2C%20FL"&gt;Daytona Beach&lt;/a&gt;, and is linked to &lt;a href="NASCAR"&gt;NASCAR&lt;/a&gt;'s late chairman. The plane was traveling from Daytona Beach to Lakeland in Florida when the pilot declared smoke in the cockpit, and attempted an emergency landing.

The 310 is a twin-engine plane that is often used for &lt;a href="w%3Aair%20shuttle"&gt;air taxi&lt;/a&gt; services, and for personal use. It seats six people, including the pilot.

The top two aides in &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; presidential candidate &lt;a href="John%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt;'s campaign have resigned from their posts today.

The resignation of campaign manager &lt;a href="w%3ATerry%20Nelson"&gt;Terry Nelson&lt;/a&gt; and long-standing chief strategist &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Weaver"&gt;John Weaver&lt;/a&gt; was announced while McCain was on the floor of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; debating strategy in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;.

Nelson said, "It has been a tremendous honor to serve Senator McCain and work on his campaign," and "I believe John McCain is the most experienced and prepared candidate to represent the Republican Party and defeat the Democratic nominee next year."

Weaver's statement echoed that of Nelson: "It has been my honor and a distinct privilege to serve someone who has always put our country first. I believe that most Americans will come to the conclusion that I have long known there is only one person equipped to serve as our nation's chief executive and deal with the challenges we face, and that person is John McCain."

In a statement, McCain said the resignations were "accepted with regret and deep gratitude for their dedication, hard work and friendship." He further said, "I will continue to address the issues of greatest concern to the American people, laying out my vision for a secure and prosperous America."

&lt;a href="w%3ARick%20Davis"&gt;Rick Davis&lt;/a&gt; will step in as campaign manager. Davis served in this capacity during McCain's 2000 presidential bid.

McCain has not performed well in recent opinion polls. He usually trails &lt;a href="Rudy%20Giuliani"&gt;Rudy Giuliani&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Mitt%20Romney"&gt;Mitt Romney&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Fred%20Thompson"&gt;Fred Thompson&lt;/a&gt;, pulling only single digits in some surveys.

Last week, McCain announced financial information for his campaign. The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;11.2 million that were raised in the last three months placed him third among &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republicans&lt;/a&gt;. The $2 million the campaign reported as cash-on-hand was viewed as a relatively small sum by analysts.

The only condition is to show "so-called serious proofs" of his guilt until this Friday. The crisis has media speculating that Poland's coalition government may fail and early elections be required.

Lepper told the journalists on his press conference that he want the so-called proofs to be shown:
&lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASelf-Defense%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Poland"&gt;Self-Defence&lt;/a&gt; stays on in the government, but, as he said, without him. He didn't want to disclose the name of his successor on the position of the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development. 

In an interview for Polish news-only channel TVN24 Lepper said that the whole situation was faked by the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ACentral%20Anticorruption%20Bureau"&gt;Central Anticorruption Bureau&lt;/a&gt; and that there is no connection with him. He repeated also that he won't come back to the government again.
He explained why Self-Defence stays on in the governing coalition as well:

The &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACouncil%20of%20the%20European%20Union"&gt;Council of Ministers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has approved the entry of Mediterranean islands &lt;a href="Cyprus"&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Malta"&gt;Malta&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEurozone"&gt;Eurozone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . They will begin to use the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aeuro"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from January 1, 2008.

European finance ministers (collectively known as Ecofin) set fixed rates of one euro to 0.585274 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACypriot%20pounds"&gt;Cypriot pounds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and 0.4293 to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMaltese%20lira"&gt;Maltese lira&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . &lt;a href="Slovenia"&gt;Slovenia&lt;/a&gt; was the first new country to join, which adopted it in January of 2007. No other country has yet met the strict entry criteria into the Eurozone, including inflation, which prevented the entry of states such as &lt;a href="Estonia"&gt;Estonia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Latvia"&gt;Latvia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Lithuania"&gt;Lithuania&lt;/a&gt;.

The news comes amid a rising value of the euro, on the same day it reached a new all-time high of 1.37 &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; dollars.

Yesterday, amid the celebration of the &lt;a href="w%3AArgentine%20Declaration%20of%20Independence"&gt;Argentinian Independence Day&lt;/a&gt;, snow and sleet surprised many in the greater area of &lt;a href="w%3ABuenos%20Aires"&gt;Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt; and other parts of &lt;a href="Argentina"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;. It was the first snowfall there since June 22, 1918. The National Weather Service even doubted to announce the predicted snowfall, because it is a phenomenon that occurs only about every hundred years.

"It's the first time that sleet falls here since the sixties, and it hasn't snowed since 1918 –I wasn't even born yet," said Diana Morinelli, a resident of the Olivos locality.

The snow fell mostly during the night and when the inhabitants of the capital city left their homes in the morning, many began to play with the snow. In 1918, the snowfall inspired composer Agustín Bardi's ¿Qué noche! (What a night!) tango.

Argentine daily &lt;a href="w%3ALa%20Naci%C3%B3n"&gt;♡❤La Nación♡❤&lt;/a&gt; reported that at least two homeless persons died because of the unusual cold. In &lt;a href="w%3ASanta%20Rosa%2C%20La%20Pampa"&gt;Santa Rosa, La Pampa&lt;/a&gt;, the temperature was -10°C, with the perceived temperature as low as -15°C in some cities. Late May, the lowest temperatures in Buenos Aires in 40 years caused 23 deaths due to &lt;a href="w%3Ahypothermia"&gt;hypothermia&lt;/a&gt;, and an energy crisis.

The Argentinian version of &lt;a href="Google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; decorated its main page with an Argentinian flag to celebrate the Independence day.

In the third and longest stage of the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Tour%20de%20France"&gt;Tour de France&lt;/a&gt; today, the &lt;a href="Switzerland"&gt;Swiss&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href="w%3AFabian%20Cancellara"&gt;Fabian Cancellara&lt;/a&gt; didn't wait to compete with the sprinters, and used his time trial qualities to just hold them off and haul in a second victory.

The riders had 236.5 &lt;a href="w%3AKilometre"&gt;km&lt;/a&gt; in front of them when they started around 11 a.m. this morning in &lt;a href="w%3AWaregem"&gt;Waregem&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Belgium"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;, heading for the &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; town &lt;a href="w%3ACompi%C3%A8gne"&gt;Compiègne&lt;/a&gt;, which is known also as the start of the race &lt;a href="w%3AParis-Roubaix"&gt;Paris-Roubaix&lt;/a&gt;. Remarkably, the riders didn't go faster than 30 km/hour most of the stage, so they came in an hour behind schedule after almost seven hours in the saddle.

After an early escape, &lt;a href="w%3ANicolas%20Vogondy"&gt;Nicolas Vogondy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMatthieu%20Ladagnous"&gt;Matthieu Ladagnous&lt;/a&gt; were joined by &lt;a href="w%3AStephane%20Auge"&gt;Stephane Auge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AFrederik%20Willems"&gt;Frederik Willems&lt;/a&gt; (the first three French, the latter Belgian) at 42 km of the finish. The former duo had a maximum lead of around 13 minutes 45 seconds, but the quartet of escapees was caught by the peleton just 500 m from the finish.
The yellow jersey and winner of the prologue took an early shot at the finale and managed to keep off &lt;a href="w%3AErik%20Zabel"&gt;Erik Zabel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADanilo%20Napolitano"&gt;Danilo Napolitano&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Boonen"&gt;Tom Boonen&lt;/a&gt;, among others. The bonus seconds expand Canchellara's lead from 13 to 33 seconds. In the climbing ranking, &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Millar"&gt;David Millar&lt;/a&gt; lost the &lt;a href="w%3APolka%20dot%20jersey"&gt;polka dot jersey&lt;/a&gt; to Stephane Auge but remains third, 43 seconds behind Cancellara.

&lt;a href="w%3AAl-Qaeda"&gt;Al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;'s No.2 &lt;a href="w%3AAyman%20al-Zawahiri"&gt;Ayman al-Zawahiri&lt;/a&gt; warned in a 20-minute audiotaped message that the &lt;a href="w%3AKnighthood%20of%20Salman%20Rushdie"&gt;knighthood&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ASalman%20Rushdie"&gt;Salman Rushdie&lt;/a&gt; was defying the Islamic world by granting the honour to the author of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Satanic%20Verses"&gt;The Satanic Verses&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, which was deemed an insult to &lt;a href="w%3AIslam"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;.

Al-Zawahri said in the message that a "very precise response" is in preparation to retaliate against this offence, "And if you did not understand, listen, we are ready to repeat it for you."

Rushdie was given the &lt;a href="w%3AKnight"&gt;knighthood&lt;/a&gt; last month by &lt;a href="w%3AElizabeth%20II%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom"&gt;Queen Elizabeth II&lt;/a&gt;.

On Friday, anonymous threats were sent to the evolutionary biology labs at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Colorado%20at%20Boulder"&gt;University of Colorado at Boulder&lt;/a&gt; by email and workers returned to their labs Monday morning to find threatening messages slipped under their doors. The threats mention a group affiliated with &lt;a href="w%3AYoung%20Earth%20Creationism"&gt;creationism&lt;/a&gt;, but police did not release the name of the group as it is still investigating if the threats were sent by them.

Currently, the University of Colorado police are not providing further details as they investigate the threats. Police have in the meantime increased patrols around the campus and threatened buildings. 

Although the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; has had vigorous debate over the &lt;a href="w%3ACreation-evolution%20controversy"&gt;Creation-evolution controversy&lt;/a&gt; to date there have been no serious violent incidents, aside from an attack on &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Mirecki"&gt;Paul Mirecki&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Kansas"&gt;University of Kansas&lt;/a&gt;, in 2005.

Hundreds of legal, highly-skilled workers in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; sent hundreds of flowers to the Director of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Citizenship%20and%20Immigration%20Services"&gt;United States Citizenship and Immigration Services&lt;/a&gt; (USCIS), Emilio Gonzalez as part of a symbolic and peaceful protest over what they said was a "flip-flop" by the State Department and the USCIS on eliminating &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Permanent%20Resident%20Card"&gt;Green card&lt;/a&gt; processing delays.

Dr. Gonzalez announced on the USCIS website late last night that the flowers will be forwarded to the injured service members recuperating at &lt;a href="w%3AWalter%20Reed%20Army%20Medical%20Center"&gt;Walter Reed Army Medical Center&lt;/a&gt; and at Bethesda Naval Hospital. 

In response, Immigration Voice, a non-profit organization representing skilled, legal immigrants, said that they welcome the fact that Dr. Gonzalez acknowledged the symbolic gesture of our protest and are overjoyed that these flowers will brighten the day of the injured service brethren. 

Immigration Voice also said that it is their sacrifice for American freedom that has made this country great and such a desirable destination for multitude of people from around the world and that they wanted to say "Thank you and god bless you" to the servicemen.

The &lt;a href="w%3AFBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJackson%20County%2C%20Texas"&gt;Jackson County&lt;/a&gt; police have tracked down the people who videotaped a two year old girl, unsecured and unresponsive in the back seat floorboard of a moving van. In the video, it is suggested that the child had been given the drug &lt;a href="w%3AMDMA"&gt;ecstasy&lt;/a&gt;.

In the video which was taken off &lt;a href="YouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, the toddler was not in a child seat, appeared unresponsive and was rolling her eyes so only her whites showed. There were comments made in the video that the little girl may have been given ecstasy - one teen in the van said "Cookie, stop rolling, girl" and "you shouldn't have popped no x". 'X' is a slang term for ecstasy. 

Police tracked down the people involved via the &lt;a href="MySpace"&gt;MySpace&lt;/a&gt; and YouTube accounts used to post the video. The local police say it will be hard to prove if she was really given ecstasy since the drug is metabolised by the body within 48 hours. 

In addition to the infant, three adults and four teens are seen in the video, with the camera being passed around between them. The van was being driven by the 21-year-old mother of the child. The mother, adults and teens are being questioned by the local police while the children are being taken care of by other family members.

&lt;a href="w%3AWMAQ-TV"&gt;WMAQ-TV NBC 5 Chicago&lt;/a&gt; announced yesterday that reporter &lt;a href="w%3AAmy%20Jacobson"&gt;Amy Jacobson&lt;/a&gt; was leaving her job after being videotaped in a bikini with her two sons at the home of Craig Stebic. Jacobson has been covering the story of Stebic's wife Lisa, who has been missing since April 30. 

Jacobson says that she took her children on a social visit on her day off, following an invitation from Stebic's family.

Jacobson has reported at WMAQ for the last ten years. 

The video of her at Craig Stebic's home was either taken by or given to CBS 2 WBBM-TV Chicago, the CBS affiliate. The entire six minute video of Jacobson is available at cbs2chicago.com. 

The WMAQ President and General Manager Larry Wert stated "Amy has been one of our most valued reporters for over ten years The decision to part ways has been a difficult one. We wish her the very best."

Speaking with WGN Radio on Wednesday morning, Jacobson described WBBM-TV's releasing of the video a "cheap shot". 

She told Spike O'Dell that she is sickened by the entire ordeal and may pursue legal action against the people who took the video of her at Craig Stebic's house. Jacobson said her attorney told her it is illegal to videotape people on private property and she said she "is looking at all of her legal options." 

A press release was sent to the WMAQ-TV Newsroom staff on July 10, 2007.

Jacobson came to WMAQ-TV in 1996 from Fox affiliate WJBK located in Detroit. Jacobson is a native of Mount Prospect. She began her career at KSAX and also worked in El Paso and Tucson, AZ. She started at WMAQ as a freelance reporter and moved up to general assignment reporter. She and her husband have two children and live on the north side of Chicago.
