The &lt;a href="w%3AWHO"&gt;World Health Organization's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABeijing"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt; spokesman has said that the &lt;a href="w%3APRC"&gt;People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; has withheld vital information regarding &lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt; outbreaks, a type of &lt;a href="w%3Abird%20flu"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt; that is infecting animals throughout Asia. The animals most affected by the disease are those among &lt;a href="w%3AWaterfowl"&gt;waterfowl&lt;/a&gt; and poultry, however in recents months it has infected humans and has also been discovered in &lt;a href="w%3ATiger"&gt;tigers&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href="w%3ASwine"&gt;swine&lt;/a&gt;. ♡❤The Nation♡❤ magazine quotes WHO officials as saying that the strain has the potential of causing a human &lt;a href="w%3Apandemic"&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt; (global epidemic) resulting in tens of millions of deaths. 

The first appearance of this type of flu was in Hong Kong during 1997. As of July 21, 2005, one hundred and nine cases of human infection have been confirmed resulting in fifty five deaths outside of China reports the Centers for Disease Control. China has reported no deaths in the recent outbreaks, leading to speculation of a cover up. ♡❤The Economist♡❤ says eleven countries across Asia have been affected, and more than one hundred and twenty million birds have died from infection or been culled. Although this week a case was found in Russia making it the first European country with an infection and twelfth in the world.

Usually these flu viruses are carried worldwide by wild bird populations in their intestines and are non-lethal. However this variant has mutated into the most lethal strain of influenza ever recorded says Mike Davis, author of ♡❤The Monster at Our Door: The Global Threat of Avian Flu♡❤. Such occurrences are natural and have happened in the past as in the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic.

The current virus is morphing into a type that is spread among humans with the first human-to-human cases found in Vietnam during 2005. When avian influenza subtypes adapt for this mode of transmission the effect is deadly for humans as the immune system has no natural immunities for it and the production of appropriate antibodies to fight the infection takes some time.

Further complicating the effort to combat H5N1, it was reported in the Washington Post that the People's Republic of China has been administering the medication &lt;a href="w%3AAmantadine"&gt;Amantadine&lt;/a&gt; to poultry in violation of international livestock regulations that state it is for human use only since the late-1990s (all the time officially denying any cases of bird flu among its poultry); the result has been that the virus is now largely immune to the medication and is significantly deadlier. World Health Organization officials had been preparing to use the drug to fight a future pandemic and now it has been rendered useless.

Chinese government officials have said more than 1,000 migratory birds have been found dead during 2005 and there have been unofficial Internet reports of one hundred and twenty related human fatalities that are strongly denied by Beijing. 

China has previously irked international agencies for its handling of public and agricultural health crises, notably the SARS epidemic that began in 2002. China's health minister was fired after the government acknowledged it had covered up the extent of the SARS outbreak by preventing reports about the illness for months and by minimizing its seriousness says the Washgington Post.

Margaret Chan, WHO director of pandemic influenza preparedness is pressing China to allow laboratories to examine specimens from birds in Qinghai, where the H5N1 virus has killed more than 5,000 birds from five species. Recombinomics has found Chinese message boards indicating part of Qinghai province may be under martial law and quarantine. 

Three outbreaks of H5N1 have affected China in recent months but the World Health Organization has not received the information or the virus samples from infected birds that they requested. "It is a matter of urgency," said Roy Wadia, the WHO's speaker in China. "We stress that this virus is highly unpredictable and versatile and can change any time. It is highly dangerous."

On Sunday, a group of 80 people from &lt;a href="w%3ABeijing"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AShanghai"&gt;Shanghai&lt;/a&gt; landed at &lt;a href="w%3AHeathrow"&gt;Heathrow&lt;/a&gt; to become the first Chinese to arrive in the United Kingdom on tourist visas.

After protracted negotiations last year, the UK was granted "Approved Destination Status" (ADS) by the &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; in January 2005. The agreement will also allow travel companies to establish offices in China to promote tourism to the UK.

Before the signing of the agreement, China allowed only students and people on business trips to visit the country. It is estimated that 135,000 people visited the UK last year &amp;mdash; just 0.6% of China's external tourism market.

The 80 tourists are expected to visit London, &lt;a href="w%3AOxfordshire"&gt;Oxfordshire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AStratford-upon-Avon"&gt;Stratford-upon-Avon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AScotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, where they will meet the First Minister, &lt;a href="w%3AJack%20McConnell"&gt;Jack McConnell&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href="w%3AEdinburgh%20Castle"&gt;Edinburgh Castle&lt;/a&gt;. The Duke of York is expected to greet the tourists at the &lt;a href="w%3ATower%20of%20London"&gt;Tower of London&lt;/a&gt; later today. Other destinations will include Liverpool (twinned with Shanghai) and Manchester's &lt;a href="w%3AOld%20Trafford"&gt;Old Trafford&lt;/a&gt; stadium, where the football team &lt;a href="w%3AManchester%20United"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt; play. They have a large following in China and are currently on a Far East tour. They are to play &lt;a href="w%3ABeijing%20Hyundai"&gt;Beijing Hyundai&lt;/a&gt; in a friendly match tomorrow. 

The visit comes after the London attacks earlier this month provoked fears by the British tourist industry of a reduction in tourism to the UK.

The UK tourist industry hopes that by 2020, Chinese tourism to the UK will bring £500 million pounds (about $878 million US dollars) annually to the UK economy.

A suspect package discovered in Little Wormwood Scrubs, west London is apparently a fifth bomb made to the same design as those used in the 21 July attacks. The device was subjected to controlled explosion by the police over the weekend and its discovery has led to speculation that a fifth bombing attempt may have been intended that day. The device was apparently a &lt;a href="w%3Anail%20bomb"&gt;nail bomb&lt;/a&gt;.

Little Wormwood Scrubs is just north of Shepherd's Bush (scene of one of Thursday's bombing attempts) and White City (the location of the BBC's TV centre). It also borders on North Pole sidings, which are used by the Eurostar cross-channel train which travels through the Channel Tunnel.

Australia has won the first test of &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Ashes"&gt;The Ashes&lt;/a&gt; series against England by 239 runs at Lords in London. 

Rain threatened to halt the Australia's charge towards victory on Day Four but it held off long enough for Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne to together pick up the five required wickets for victory. 

Earlier, Australia's 9th and 10th wicket partnerships put on 95 runs between them, leaving England with the unlikely chase of 420 runs. 

McGrath bowled superbly in the test and finished with match figures of 9-82. The 35 year-old claimed his 500th test wicket in the first innings, placing him fourth on the all-time list. For the home team, debutant Kevin Pieterson scored 57 and 64 not out to ensure England were not thrashed.

Scores: Australia 190 and 384, England 155 and 180

The &lt;a href="http%3A//www.peacetaxseven.com/"&gt;Peace Tax Seven&lt;/a&gt;, who are campaigning to have the 10 per cent of their taxes which go to Britain's defence budget diverted to non-military uses, have had their case rejected by a &lt;a href="w%3AUK%20High%20Court"&gt;High Court&lt;/a&gt; judge. 

The judicial review was called for under article 9 of the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Convention%20on%20Human%20Rights"&gt;European Convention on Human Rights&lt;/a&gt; which guarantees freedom 'to manifest one's religion or beliefs' and which was made a part of British law in 1998. The Convention includes the right to conscientious objection and the campaigners claim that this gives them the right not to pay other people to go to war on their behalf.

Their statement to the court said: "We want to make a positive contribution to society by paying our tax in full. We object in conscience to paying others to kill on our behalf, but current tax policy forces us to do just that."

The courtroom had to be enlarged to make room for supporters and the judge listened to the case for three hours. 
Roy Prockter, an accountant and campaign member as well as a &lt;a href="w%3AQuaker"&gt;Quaker&lt;/a&gt;, said that the judge told them that "our case has no possibility of being resolved in the British courts". According to the Guardian, the judge suggested they take the case to Strasbourg. Roy said that the members were going to take time for reflection as they awaited the written judgment from the judge.

With the problem with the fuel gauge still unexplained &lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; has announced that in may bend some of its long-standing safety rules to launch the &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Discovery"&gt;Space Shuttle Discovery&lt;/a&gt; on time. NASA managers have decided to launch with just three of the four fuel gauges working if the problem reappears Tuesday, however this would mean disregarding the rule created in 1986 after the &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Challenger"&gt;Challenger&lt;/a&gt; explosion. In a press conference on July 13, NASA officials commented that they have never in the past flown a shuttle with less than four sensors working.

"There's very little in life that is 100 percent guaranteed, and there's probably less in rocket science that's 100 percent guaranteed," deputy shuttle program manager &lt;a href="w%3AWayne%20Hale"&gt;Wayne Hale&lt;/a&gt; said over the weekend. "That is part of the risk we take."

Discovery and the crew of 7 are set to blast-off for the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Space%20Station"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt; at 10:39 a.m. Tuesday morning. This will be the first launch since the &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Columbia%20disaster"&gt;Space Shuttle Columbia disaster&lt;/a&gt; two and a half years ago.

Windsor Castle, one of &lt;a href="w%3AElizabeth%20II%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom"&gt;Queen Elizabeth II&lt;/a&gt; of the United Kingdom's official residences, is to get a &lt;a href="w%3AHydroelectricity"&gt;hydro-electric&lt;/a&gt; power scheme.

The £1 million project will consist of a series of under-water turbines to be installed at Romney Weir in the nearby &lt;a href="w%3ARiver%20Thames"&gt;River Thames&lt;/a&gt;. The system will generate 200kW, enough to meet approximately one third of the castle's electricity needs.

The electricity from the four turbines will not be sold into the local electricity grid, but will instead be directly connected to &lt;a href="w%3AWindsor%20Castle"&gt;Windsor Castle's&lt;/a&gt; electrical system. It will save 600 tonnes of carbon dioxide from being released into the atmosphere every year.

The scheme was announced after it gained planning permission from the local council, the plans having been submitted in February of last year. A feasability study will now be conducted, with construction scheduled to start next year.

The Windsor Castle is not the only environmentally-friendly Royal scheme. A borehole beneath &lt;a href="w%3ABuckingham%20Palace"&gt;Buckingham Palace&lt;/a&gt; provides cold water for air-conditioning and the &lt;a href="w%3APrince%20Philip%2C%20Duke%20of%20Edinburgh"&gt;Duke of Edinburgh's&lt;/a&gt; taxi runs on liquid petroleum gas.

As the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;US Senate&lt;/a&gt; is about to take its annual August recess, they have not yet taken action on the controversial &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; ambassador nomination of &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Bolton"&gt;John Bolton&lt;/a&gt;. With &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Congress"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt; gone and &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; at his ranch in Texas, White House press secretary &lt;a href="w%3AScott%20McClellan"&gt;Scott McClellan&lt;/a&gt;, speaking unofficially, hinted that Bush might exercise his constitutional authority and post him to the U.N. by use of a &lt;a href="w%3Arecess%20appointment"&gt;recess appointment&lt;/a&gt;.

The appointment would stand until January 2007 before it would once again become subject to Senate confirmation. 

The Bolton nomination was passed on to the full Senate for consideration on March 17. This was done without a favorable recommendation from the &lt;a href="w%3A%20U.S.%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Foreign%20Relations"&gt;Senate Foreign Relations Committee&lt;/a&gt;. 

Senators &lt;a href="w%3AJoseph%20Biden"&gt;Joseph Biden&lt;/a&gt; (D-&lt;a href="w%3ADelaware"&gt;DE&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href="w%3A%20Christopher%20Dodd"&gt;Christopher Dodd&lt;/a&gt; (D-&lt;a href="w%3AConnecticut"&gt;CT&lt;/a&gt;) succeeded twice in leading Democrats to block efforts of Republican chamber leaders to bring the matter to a vote. Democrats raised questions on whether Bolton abused subordinates while acting in his role as undersecretary of state, and whether he tried to pressure intelligence analysts to issue reports that conformed to his views. There was also the question of Bolton's past criticisms of the body of the United Nations itself.

Democratic &lt;a href="w%3A%20filibuster"&gt;filibusters&lt;/a&gt; demanded of the Bush administration that it release classified information regarding the involvements of Bolton in his position as the Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security since May 11, 2001. In the past, however, Senate confirmation was granted him to fill positions in government posts on four occasions.

With a week to go before recess, there are no signs of a Senate breakthrough.

In 1998, former President &lt;a href="w%3A%20Bill%20Clinton"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt; selected &lt;a href="w%3A%20Richard%20Holbrooke"&gt;Richard Holbrooke&lt;/a&gt;. In what some have called "partisan bickering", Republicans blocked Holbrooke for 14 months, before he was finally confirmed in August 1999.

The death of &lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazilian&lt;/a&gt;-born &lt;a href="w%3AJean%20Charles%20de%20Menezes"&gt;Jean Charles de Menezes&lt;/a&gt; in London on the 21st of July at the hands of British police, who mistook him for a terrorist, is being called an "assassination" by the mayor of Gonzaga, Brazil. "It's easy for Blair to apologize, but it doesn't mean very much," said Mayor Julio de Souza, referring to Metropolitan Police commissioner Sir Ian Blair's description of the incident as a "tragedy". "What happened to English justice and England, a place where police patrol unarmed?"

Brazil's Foreign Minister, Celso Amorin, came to London and said president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva asked him "to take firm measures to defend the interests of the family of a Brazilian who died in an absurd manner."

Brazilian protesters called for the arrest of the policemen who shot Menezes, and are also demanding the immediate return of the victim's body, as traditionally in Brazil bodies are buried within 24 hours of death. 

According to witnesses, police pursued the fleeing Menezes into a subway station and held him to the ground before shooting him. London was on heightened alert after the 7th of July's deadly bombings.

Chinese officials have ceased the export of pork from two cities after at least 31 individuals died and 152 were taken ill after contracting a mysterious disease related to pigs. China leads the world in the production of pork products.

Symptoms of the illness include fatigue, headache, high fever, vomiting, and eventually coma. Subcutaneous bruising has also been observed in some patients.

Initial reports indicated that those becoming sick had recently butchered sick sheep or pigs. Lab tests in China have revealed that victims may be suffering an infection of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AStreptococcus%20suis"&gt;Streptococcus suis&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ -- a bacteria found in many pork producing countries.

Serious cases of ♡❤Streptococcus suis♡❤ infection can lead to &lt;a href="w%3Acoma"&gt;coma&lt;/a&gt; and eventually &lt;a href="w%3Ameningitis"&gt;meningitis&lt;/a&gt;. Thus far, no human-to-human transmissions have been observed.

A moderate earthquake shook western &lt;a href="w%3AMontana"&gt;Montana&lt;/a&gt; at 10:08 p.m. on Monday. No immediate reports of damage have been received by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and its National Earthquake Information Center.

The Burundian authorities have forcibly shut down one of &lt;a href="w%3ABurundi"&gt;Burundi's&lt;/a&gt; most popular independent radio stations, Radio Publique Africain. The move came despite &lt;a href="Press%20freedom%20groups%20condemn%20two-day%20radio%20station%20ban%20in%20Burundi"&gt;a compromise deal agreed last week between RPA and the Burundian authorities&lt;/a&gt;. 

Burundi's National Communications Council (CNC) had ordered the indefinite suspension of RPA on July 15th, claiming that its coverage of recent elections had been biased, and that the radio station had insulted them. The station's Director Alexis Sinduhije rejected the allegations, and Burundian media groups accused the CNC of acting as a tool of political repression. Following negotiations, the authorities lifted the indefinite ban, after RPA agreed to a 2-day suspension. 

RPA went off air on Monday July 18th. Broadcasts were resumed on Thursday morning, but less than 48 hours later the authorities were attempting to shut down the station again. 

Bujumbura journalist Gregoire Wakana, writing on the African news website abarundi.org, reported a tense stand-off outside the radio station on Friday afternoon, as around 30 soldiers, led by Colonel Ildephonse Mushwabure, tried to gain entry. "The suspense lasted several hours, and a large crowd gathered, with several Burundian journalists coming to watch the fate of their RPA colleagues". 

Abarundi.org reports "widespread indignation" over RPA's closure, with onlookers shouting angrily at the authorities as they moved in on the station. Some later threw stones at a nearby building owned by the Burundian President Domitien Ndayizeye. 

Abarundi.org notes that Colonel Mushwabure is a controversial figure in Burundi, after giving contradictory statements to a UN inquiry over his whereabouts during the 1993 coup led to the assassination of the country's first democratic president, Melchior &lt;a href="w%3ANdadaye"&gt;Ndadaye&lt;/a&gt;. Last month's elections were the first since the coup, which plunged Burundi into more than a decade of vicious, ethnically-charged civil war. 

Earlier this week, the head of the UN's electoral unit in Burundi praised the country's media, saying it had "masterfully played its role of democratic watchdog by helping Burundians to allay their fears and go to the polls".

The dispute between RPA and the Burundian government has been monitored by the international press freedom watchdog the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). 

"RPA fell silent around 5 p.m. local time as police broke into the station compound, padlocked its studios, and cut off its transmitter. It was not immediately clear if any RPA staff had been arrested, although one journalist told the CPJ in a brief phone call, "they are taking us to the police station", they announced in a press release on Friday. 

"No one is above the law. Sanctions must be taken against whoever breaks the law... African Public Radio continues to show its lack of respect towards the authorities", the National Communications Council chairman Jean-Pierre Manda was quoted by Reuters as saying on Saturday.

The council had accused RPA of giving disproportionate coverage to the opposition FDD party in recent elections. 

The FDD heavily defeated President &lt;a href="w%3ADomitien%20Ndayizeye"&gt;Domitien Ndayizeye&lt;/a&gt;'s FRODEBU party, gaining a majority of seats in the country's National Assembly, with 58% of the popular vote. The party is now expected to form the next government.

Abarundi.org reports that the men who broke into the radio station were unable to produce any kind of warrant. RPA's director Alexis Sinduhije told Reuters he had evidence Ndayizeye issued the order to shut down the radio station, calling it "an abuse of power". 

"If they (the communication council) believe I have insulted them, they must go to court, but not punish the radio and the public audience," Reuters quoted him as saying.

"CPJ is outraged at the Burundian authorities' failure to deliver on their promise,", said CPJ Executive Director Ann Cooper, in a press release. "We call on President Ndayizeye to ensure that RPA can resume broadcasting immediately, allowing journalists to work freely without fear of reprisal."

Quoting Burundi National Radio and Television, BBC monitoring has reported that President &lt;a href="w%3ADomitien%20Ndayizeye"&gt;Domitien Ndayizeye&lt;/a&gt; met representatives of a media organization on Saturday to discuss the reopening of Radio Publique Africaine.

The president reportedly decided to close the radio in order to "safeguard the integrity of state institutions."

<h1>Inter lead race to snap-up Figo</h1>

&lt;a href="w%3AInternazionale"&gt;Internazionale&lt;/a&gt; are understood to be on the brink of snapping up &lt;a href="w%3AReal%20Madrid"&gt;Real Madrid&lt;/a&gt; star, &lt;a href="w%3ALuis%20Figo"&gt;Luis Figo&lt;/a&gt; and are also thought to be leading the race to sign him.

According to the Italian newspapwer &lt;a href="w%3AGazzetta%20dello%20Sport"&gt;Gazzetta dello Sport&lt;/a&gt;, the 32-year-old &lt;a href="w%3APortuguese"&gt;Portuguese&lt;/a&gt; right-side midfielder, who has been a &lt;a href="w%3ALiverpool%20F.C"&gt;Liverpool F.C&lt;/a&gt; transfer target for quite some time, is close to agreeing a deal with Inter.

Reports in &lt;a href="w%3ASpain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, however, suggest Figo will finally resolve his dispute with the Madrid giants when he returns from the club's pre-season tour of &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; later this week, clearing the way for a move to &lt;a href="w%3AMerseyside"&gt;Merseyside&lt;/a&gt;. 
Liverpool F.C. manager &lt;a href="w%3ARafael%20Benitez"&gt;Rafael Benitez&lt;/a&gt; has also revealed that he will buy a right-sided midfielder before the start of the new &lt;a href="w%3AFA%20Premier%20League"&gt;Premiership&lt;/a&gt; campaign. 
"We are waiting for news, we have heard nothing as yet," he said. "We are in Lithuania and he is flying from Japan so maybe we will hear something later in the week." 
Figo has been in dispute with Real over the payment of the final year of his contract. 
Liverpool are likely to offer Figo wages of around £60,000 a week, if he does sign, but Inter are also stepping up by stating that they would give him around €3.5 Million &lt;a href="w%3AEuros"&gt;Euros&lt;/a&gt; a year.

&lt;a href="w%3AMohammed%20Bouyeri"&gt;Mohammed Bouyeri&lt;/a&gt;, a radical Islamist who was a member of the &lt;a href="w%3AHofstad%20Network"&gt;Hofstad Network&lt;/a&gt;, was sentenced to life in prison by a court in &lt;a href="w%3AAmsterdam"&gt;Amsterdam&lt;/a&gt; for the killing of the controversial filmmaker &lt;a href="w%3ATheo%20van%20Gogh%20%28film%20director%29"&gt;Theo van Gogh&lt;/a&gt; in November 2004.

Van Gogh was ambushed on an Amsterdam street and shot repeatedly in the chest before Bouyeri stabbed him and slit his throat. The judgment said that Bouyeri showed "complete disregard for human life" and butchered Van Gogh "mercilessly".

Bouyeri, a 27 year who holds joint &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Netherlands"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3AMorocco"&gt;Moroccan&lt;/a&gt; citizenship, claimed he acted on behalf of Islam. He made a confession in the courtroom and vowed he would "do it again" if he had the chance.

Van Gogh had been a staunch critic of Islam and its perceived mistreatment of women. Van Gogh directed several movies critical of Islam, most notably ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASubmission%20%28movie%29"&gt;Submission&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ in which verses of the &lt;a href="w%3AQur%27an"&gt;Qur'an&lt;/a&gt; were written on naked women's bodies.

The &lt;a href="NASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle"&gt;Space Shuttle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Discovery"&gt;Discovery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; roared into the &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; sky at 10:39AM ET (14:39 UTC), 2 weeks after the launch was scrubbed due to a faulty sensor. The launch was the start of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASTS-114"&gt;STS-114&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; mission, which is planned to be completed on August 7, 2005.
Solid rocket booster separation was triggered two minutes and five seconds into the flight after burnout of the putty-like fuel packed inside each rocket. The firing of explosive bolts freed the twin boosters from the side of the external tank, allowing them to peel away from the space shuttle. Parachutes were then automatically deployed from the boosters, allowing them to slowly descend into the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;Atlantic Ocean&lt;/span&gt; where they will be towed back to shore.
&lt;br style="clear: both;"&gt;

Discovery initiated the command for main engine cutoff, or MECO, at the 8-minute, 23-second mark. MECO shuts down the orbiter's three powerful engines in the rear of Discovery after completing the "uphill" climb into space.

With the ascent into space complete and fuel in the external tank exhausted, Discovery jettisoned the orange canister. Following jettison, Commander &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEileen%20Collins"&gt;Eileen Collins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; pitched the orbiter up until the tank could be sighted through the orbiter´s upper windows. Mission Specialist &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASoichi%20Noguchi"&gt;Soichi Noguchi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; then took digital photographs and video of the external tank from a distance of just 1,500 feet.

The confidence of American consumers in their economy has slipped unexpectedly in July after it had risen the previous three months.

The &lt;a href="w%3AIndex%20of%20Consumer%20Confidencew"&gt;Consumer Confidence Index&lt;/a&gt; dropped from 106.2 in June to 103.2 this July, the ♡❤Conference Board♡❤ said in New York. Analysts blame it on Amercians' increased fear over job security, wage perspectives, and rising gas prices.

But Lynn Franco, director of the board's ♡❤Consumer Research Center♡❤, is unconcerned: "The overall state of the economy remains healthy and consumers' outlook suggests no storm clouds on the short-term horizon."

In the last months, several large American corporations have announced job cuts. Among them are &lt;a href="w%3AEastman%20Kodak"&gt;Eastman Kodak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHewlett-Packard"&gt;Hewlett-Packard&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AKimberly-Clark"&gt;Kimberly-Clark&lt;/a&gt;.

Private consumer spending is considered to be the backbone of the U.S. economy since it accounts for two-thirds of its &lt;a href="w%3AGross%20Domestic%20Product"&gt;Gross Domestic Product&lt;/a&gt;. However, in the last few years, the correlation between consumer confidence and actual retail sales has been questioned since consumers were spending money even when survey figures said they wouldn't.

&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Shields"&gt;Michael Shields&lt;/a&gt;, an 18-year old &lt;a href="Liverpool%20Football%20Club"&gt;Liverpool Football Club&lt;/a&gt; supporter, has been jailed for the &lt;a href="w%3Aattempted%20murder"&gt;attempted murder&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href="Bulgaria"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt;n barman, despite another man from Liverpool admitting full responsibility.

Shields, 18 from &lt;a href="w%3AWavertree"&gt;Wavertree&lt;/a&gt; was charged with the attempted murder of Martin Georgiev, 25, after being accused of throwing a brick at the barman's head in the city of &lt;a href="w%3AVarna"&gt;Varna&lt;/a&gt;, where he was celebrating Liverpool football club's win over &lt;a href="w%3AAC%20Milan"&gt;AC Milan&lt;/a&gt; in the final of the &lt;a href="w%3AUEFA%20Champions%20League"&gt;Champions League&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AIstanbul"&gt;Istanbul&lt;/a&gt; in May.

Before being charged, a 20 year old man from &lt;a href="w%3AAnfield"&gt;Anfield&lt;/a&gt; came forward and claimed responsibility for the attack - Graham Sankey, made a statement through his &lt;a href="w%3Alawyer"&gt;lawyer&lt;/a&gt; David Kirwan.

Mr Kirwan said: "Graham believed the case against Michael would either be thrown or adjourned after he came forward to make his confession." Despite the confession, Shields was convicted of attempted murder.

Shields' uncle, Joey Graney, was in court when the sentence was passed and said: "Michael was sobbing. He's an 18-year-old lad, quiet as a mouse, on his own, going back to a Bulgarian jail. What's he going to do? As far as the Bulgarians were concerned, a local lad had been attacked and they wanted their scapegoat. They did not care that Graham Sankey has confessed to carrying out the attack. They just tossed that aside."

The family have said they will do everything in their power to clear Michael's name. Meanwhile, &lt;a href="w%3ALiverpool%20Riverside"&gt;Liverpool Riverside&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMP"&gt;MP&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ALouise%20Ellman"&gt;Louise Ellman&lt;/a&gt;, has backed the family's campaign calling the incident a "travesty of justice".

"Graham Sankey has admitted he was guilty of the crime that Michael Shields is now convicted of, but he did so in a way that was inadmissible to the Bulgarian court," added Mrs Ellman, who is planning to speak to his defence team.

A British &lt;a href="w%3AForeign%20Office"&gt;Foreign Office&lt;/a&gt; spokesman said it could not comment on the verdict but said it would continue offering consular help to Michael Shields.

Bulgarian government officials have since agreed to begin the process of releasing Michael Shields, in exchange for the arrest of Graham Sankey.

The development came after long-time justice campaigner Stephen Jakobi held closed talks with Bulgarian ambassador Lachezar Matev at the Bulgarian Embassy in London.

Mr. Jakobi announced that Michael could be free in the next "few months".

"It's been a good day and we have achieved an important breakthrough.

"We have got an agreement with the Bulgarian government that they are going to take up our proposed course of action - that is issuing an arrest warrant for Graham Sankey.

"The government is independent of the judiciary in that country but they can hold talks with them to get the ball rolling as soon as possible.

"The arrest warrant will means the extradition process will begin."

Home Secretary Jack Straw has also agreed to meet with Shield's family to discuss the situation with them.

After years of declining subscription rates, the owners of U.S. magazine ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ATV%20Guide"&gt;TV Guide&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ ordered a complete overhaul of the 52-year-old publication. &lt;a href="w%3AGemstar-TV%20Guide%20International"&gt;Gemstar-TV Guide International&lt;/a&gt;, the corporate parent of the magazine says the current format of the magazine has caused it to become unprofitable.

The changes will be effective with the October 15 issue. Lack of profitability has been a point of contention between Gemstar management and its largest shareholder, &lt;a href="w%3ARupert%20Murdoch"&gt;Rupert Murdoch&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ANews%20Corporation"&gt;News Corporation&lt;/a&gt;. 

Included in the new design is a shift away from detailed listings to more of a ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3APeople%20magazine"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ or ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AEntertainment%20Weekly"&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ celebrity-focused format. Included in that change will be the elimination of the 140 localized editions of ♡❤TV Guide♡❤ in favor of one national publication with only "Eastern" and "Pacific" times listed for program listings. 

The magazine's owners noted that with the advent of digital cable and satellite TV, more viewers rely upon electronic program guides provided free by the television service provider than printed listings.

TV Guide officials say the current magazine is made up of 25 percent news content printed on glossy paper and 75 percent TV listings printed on newsprint and in black-and-white. The new version of the magazine will be completely four-color and on glossy paper. Additionally, the news-to-listing ratio will flip with 75 percent of future content being feature articles on celebrities and television programs.

A second change will be the magazine's size as it moves from a digest-sized publication to a full-sized glossy. The company expects the larger edition will be more profitable against competition such as ♡❤People♡❤ and ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Weekly"&gt;US Weekly&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. But that profitability may be at the expense of national reach.

Although the magazine is getting physically larger, according to reports, the readership is expected to shrink. Gemstar expects many of is subscribers not to renew with the new format. Currently the TV Guide guarantees 9 million subscribers to its national advertisers. According to reports, it is only guaranteeing 3.2 million subscribers to its revamped publication once it hits newsstands.

&lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Chibitty"&gt;Charles Chibitty&lt;/a&gt;, the last surviving member of the group of 17 who served in World War II as the &lt;a href="w%3AComanche"&gt;Comanche&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACode%20talker"&gt;"code talkers"&lt;/a&gt; died in a &lt;a href="w%3ATulsa%2C%20Oklahoma"&gt;Tulsa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AOklahoma"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt; nursing home July 20. He was 83.

Chibitty was among the 14 Comanches who landed with the &lt;a href="w%3AD-Day"&gt;D-Day&lt;/a&gt; invasion of Normandy Beaches where they reported by radio to division headquarters on the progress of the landings. The Comanche were dubbed ♡❤code talkers♡❤ because the &lt;a href="w%3ANative%20Americans"&gt;American Indian&lt;/a&gt; language has no written record, and it was never broken by the Germans during the war.
One of the first messages transmitted in Comanche language during the landings was "right beach, wrong place". It warned soldiers they landed about a half mile from their intended target. Chibitty served with a unit that landed on &lt;a href="w%3AUtah%20Beach"&gt;Utah Beach&lt;/a&gt; on June 6, 1944.

Mr.Chibitty served with the rank of a Corporal in the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%204th%20Infantry%20Division"&gt;4th Infantry Division&lt;/a&gt; that engaged in the breakthrough of the &lt;a href="w%3ASiegfried%20line"&gt;Siegfried line&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ABattle%20of%20Hurtgen%20Forest"&gt;Hurtgen Forest&lt;/a&gt;. His division also saw action in the &lt;a href="w%3ABattle%20of%20the%20Bulge"&gt;Battle of the Bulge&lt;/a&gt; and the rescue of the &lt;a href="w%3ALost%20Battalion"&gt;"Lost Battalion"&lt;/a&gt;. His division was among the first to undertake the liberation of Paris. Then later, the 4th Infantry was the first to enter Germany.

The Comanches, who came from the &lt;a href="w%3ALawton%2C%20Oklahoma"&gt;Lawton&lt;/a&gt; area in Oklahoma, heard rumors of a military plan to organize a native speaking unit. He enlisted in 1941, and along with 19 others, they were trained for special duty by the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Army%20Signal%20Corps"&gt;U.S. Army Signal Corps&lt;/a&gt;. All were sent to &lt;a href="w%3AFort%20Benning"&gt;Fort Benning&lt;/a&gt;, but three remained state-side because they had dependents and deployment in the mission was dangerous.

The U.S. declassified the code talker program in 1968. Only three remained living at the time. The French Government gave special honors to the Comanches by bestowing them with the Chevalier of the National Order of Merit in 1989. Mr. Chibitty was honored in 1999 when the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense"&gt;Pentagon&lt;/a&gt; bestowed on him the Knowlton Award.

In a 1999 interview with the Armed Forces Information Center, Chibitty said: "The Navajo did the same thing. The Navajos became code talkers about a year after the Comanches, but there were over a hundred of them because they had so much territory [in the Pacific Theater] to cover."

Joe Holley of the ♡❤Washington Post♡❤ recalled this quote from Mr. Chibitty in 2002: &lt;blockquote&gt;"It’s strange, but growing up as a child I was forbidden speak my native language at school. Later my country asked me to. My language helped win the war, and that makes me very proud. Very proud."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The funeral service was held Tuesday at 10 a.m. He has three surviving grandchildren.

The Reds were a goal down through Giedrius Barevicius who scored a close range shot aganist José Reina. Within minutes, Liverpool were back in the game with a Steven Gerrard effort, headed by Crouch and finished off by Cisse. Liverpool soon found their scoring touch through a corner converted into a goal by Jamie Carragher. It was his first in around 6 years.

The start of the second half saw captain Steven Gerrard fouled in the box and awarded a penalty. He took full advantage of the opportunity and converted it into a goal which saw Liverpool, with three goals up, looking likely for the win.

The game also marked the competitive debut of Peter Crouch who signed with Liverpool for around £7 million. Mohamed Sissoko, a former star, marked his competitive debut for Liverpool with much impact.

The game ended 3 - 1. With 3 straight away goals, it looks like Liverpool have a great chance of winning this leg.

The second leg is at on Tuesday, 2 August 2005.

A food crisis is threatening three other countries in the region of &lt;a href="w%3ANiger"&gt;Niger&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; a country facing severe food shortages after drought and plagues of locusts &amp;mdash; the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has warned.

The three &amp;mdash; &lt;a href="w%3ABurkina%20Faso"&gt;Burkina Faso&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMali"&gt;Mali&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMauritania"&gt;Mauritania&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; have been affected by drought and plagues of locusts that engulfed the &lt;a href="w%3ASahel"&gt;Sahel&lt;/a&gt; region of West Africa last August.

About 6 million are short of food and require food aid: 3.5 million from Niger; 1.1 million from Mali; 750,000 from Mauritania; and 500,000 from Burkina Faso. 

The United Nations &amp;mdash; which has a Consolidated Appeal for West Africa of just under £196 million US dollars in aid for the region this year &amp;mdash; is expecting to feed 250,000 people shortly. In May, OCHA made an additional flash appeal for $16,191,000 US dollars.

Over the past few weeks, the media has shown graphic images of the situation in Niger. &lt;a href="w%3AJan%20Egelend"&gt;Jan Egelend&lt;/a&gt;, OCHA Under-Secerary General and Emergency Relief Coordinator, claims that the situation in the region prior to this was largely ignored by the international community, saying that: "Over the last few days, the world has finally woken up, but it took graphic images of dying children for this to happen."

<h1>Windows Vista faces possible trademark challenges</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Windows%20Vista%20faces%20possible%20trademark%20challenges&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Microsoft, the world's largest software company, announced the name of its forthcoming version of the &lt;a href="w%3AWindows%20operating%20system"&gt;Windows operating system&lt;/a&gt; from its headquarters in &lt;a href="w%3ARedmond%2C%20Washington"&gt;Redmond, Washington&lt;/a&gt; Friday. But in choosing the name "Vista," Microsoft may find itself in a legal fight.

Microsoft has made a name for itself in legal circles as a company that fiercely defends its trademarks and other intellectual property. With the choice of "Vista," the tables may turn as it may face allegations of swiping another company's trademark.

It appears the Vista name has already been taken by another high-tech company, coincidentally also based in Redmond. A few miles from the sprawling Microsoft campus is &lt;a href="w%3AVista%20Incorporated"&gt;Vista Incorporated&lt;/a&gt;, which has operated a small business internet interchange since it was founded by Wall Data founder, John Wall in 2000. He was surprised by his larger neighbor's move.

"We are going to consider our options and talk to Microsoft," Wall said in an interview with the ♡❤Seattle Times♡❤. Wall reportedly has not yet filed suit against Microsoft to stop it from using the "Vista" name. An investor in &lt;a href="w%3ASCO%20Group"&gt;SCO&lt;/a&gt;, he does have other legal options aside from law suits. Instead, he may offer to sell the rights to the "Vista" name.

However, John Wall's company is not the only business with claims on the name "Vista." Many other tech companies use "Vista" as product names. Additionally, a wide-range of non-computer businesses have the name reserved, including branded products for sewing machines, elevators and the dairy industry.

The &lt;a href="w%3AIrish%20Minister%20for%20Justice%2C%20Equality%20and%20Law%20Reform"&gt;Irish Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20McDowell"&gt;Michael McDowell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATeachta%20D%C3%A1la"&gt;TD&lt;/a&gt;, announced yesterday that he understands that &lt;a href="w%3AGerry%20Adams"&gt;Gerry Adams&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20McGuinness"&gt;Martin McGuinness&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20Ferris"&gt;Martin Ferris&lt;/a&gt;, senior members of the &lt;a href="w%3AIreland"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AIrish%20republicanism"&gt;republican&lt;/a&gt; party &lt;a href="w%3ASinn%20F%C3%A9in"&gt;Sinn Féin&lt;/a&gt;, have resigned from the &lt;a href="w%3AIRA%20Army%20Council"&gt;Army Council&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="Provisional%20IRA"&gt;Provisional Irish Republican Army&lt;/a&gt;.

Mr. McDowell, who most recently accused the three of being members during a radio debate on the 20th of February this year, expressed his belief that the three had resigned seats on the IRA Army Council, the paramilitary organisation's ruling body, within the past fortnight, but he did not think that this "by itself amounts to a severance between the two organisations." Adams, the Sinn Féin president, McGuinness, the party's chief negotiator, and Ferris, a representative in &lt;a href="w%3AD%C3%A1il%20%C3%89ireann"&gt;Dáil Éireann&lt;/a&gt; (the Irish lower house of parliament), have however consistently dismissed all such allegations of membership of the seven-man Council.

The comment comes as expectation grows that the IRA will issue a statement this week concerning its future, following a plea by Adams in April for the organisation to "take courageous initiatives which will achieve [its] aims by purely political and democratic activity." Mr McDowell said he was looking forward to the statement, but said that was "no question of governments on either side of the border tolerating the continued existence of an unlawful organisation", and that the IRA must decommission its arsenal "down to the last bullet".

Claims that Sinn Féin members have left the Army Council have been described by some &lt;a href="w%3AUnionists%20%28Ireland%29"&gt;unionist&lt;/a&gt; politicians, such as &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Unionist%20Party"&gt;DUP&lt;/a&gt; spokesperson &lt;a href="w%3AIan%20Paisley%2C%20Jr."&gt;Ian Paisley, Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, as a "stunt" ahead of the expected statement from the IRA. On Monday, new &lt;a href="w%3AUlster%20Unionists"&gt;Ulster Unionist&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href="w%3AReg%20Empey"&gt;Sir Reg Empey&lt;/a&gt; expressed his opinion that "The only thing that is going to matter is what the republican movement actually do."

McGuinness is expected to travel today to the United States with senior Sinn Féin member Rita O'Hare to brief the Irish American community on the current situation.

Senator &lt;a href="Rick%20Santorum"&gt;Rick Santorum&lt;/a&gt; wrote Monday that his "intention is not to run" in the &lt;a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;GOP&lt;/a&gt; nomination for president. The two-term senator from Pennsylvania was among names mentioned as a contender to the White House in the next presidential election in 2008. 

Santorum faces a tough re-election challenge in his home state during the upcoming mid-term elections next year, where he is considered vulnerable against &lt;a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;Democratic&lt;/a&gt; challenger and state treasurer &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Patrick%20Casey%2C%20Jr."&gt;Robert P. Casey Jr.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 

Santorum authored the book "It takes a Family: Conservatism and the Common Good" which further established views of him as a near ultra-conservative. 

On the ♡❤WashingtonPost.com♡❤ on-line discussion forum, the lawmaker said, "I have six children ages 4-14. And the idea of coming off a race of the intensity that I am engaged with at this point [in Pennsylavania] and turning around and running another two-year campaign for president is not something that I believe is in the best interest of my family."

Voters in the city of &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Diego%2C%20California"&gt;San Diego, California&lt;/a&gt; went to the polls Tuesday to pick a mayor to lead the financially-troubled city. Officially mayor-less since Dick Murphy resigned on July 15, the city of San Diego also lost two councilmen to convictions on charges of corruption. The largest issue facing the next mayor of this major bio-tech hub and military town on the U.S. border with Mexico, however, is the paralysis and red ink produced by two years of underfunding the pension fund for city employees. The municipal employee unions had pushed for massive benefit expanion during the booming '90s, but once the dot-com bubble burst, San Diego, home to high-tech corporate players like Qualcomm Corp., rapidly lost revenue. The result was a $2bn pension deficit, "junk" status for the city's bonds on Wall Street, and the dubious designation of "Enron-by-the-Sea" from The New York Times. 

Incredibly, 11 candidates are on the ballot to lead the city that calls itself "America's Finest". 
The front-runner is Councilwoman Donna Frye, 53. She is expected to win a plurality of all votes cast, at the least. The city's former chief of police, Jerry Sanders, and businessman Steve Francis are dueling for the second place slot. The winner of that would face Frye again, in a run-off election slated for Nov. 8.

As of 10 pm Pacific Daylight Time July 26, Donna Frye led with 43.32%, and Jerry Sanders was leading in the contest for second place, with 27.01% to Steve Francis' 23.50%. No other candidate broke into the double-digits.

Mountain View, CA - Users of the beta &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle%20Maps"&gt;Google Maps&lt;/a&gt; service may see the world in a new way with the introduction of the "hybrid view." Here, hybrid means offering a combined satellite and map view, the hybrid button that appears on map search queries adds new functionality to the map service, combining the other choices of either map or satellite views.

The competing and similar service launched July 25 by Microsoft, also offers a hybrid-type view. Both services offer hybrid map and satellite views and scrollable images.

Initial public response to both services on &lt;a href="w%3ASlashdot"&gt;Slashdot&lt;/a&gt; has been generally positive, but users noted glitches that need to be worked out, including discrepancies between satellite and map data.

Four men were arrested at 04:30 BST (4:30 a.m.) in police raids at two addresses in Birmingham, West Midlands in relation to the failed London bombings of 21st July. 

One of the four men, arrested in Heybarnes Road in the Hay Mills area, is thought to be suspected of being one of &lt;a href="Four%20small%20explosions%20strike%20London%27s%20transport%20system"&gt;last Thursday's bombers&lt;/a&gt;, and has been taken to the high security Paddington Green police station in London. Police have acknowledged using a Taser stun gun in the arrest, but no firearms were used.

The other three arrests were made shortly afterwards in Bankdale Road, Washwood Heath. Police said a suspect package was found at one of the addresses and local residents were evacuated. 

Two men were also arrested at &lt;a href="w%3AGrantham"&gt;Grantham&lt;/a&gt; railway station after information was received from off-duty policemen on a &lt;a href="w%3AGNER"&gt;GNER&lt;/a&gt; train travelling between &lt;a href="w%3ANewcastle"&gt;Newcastle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AKings%20Cross%20railway%20station"&gt;Kings Cross&lt;/a&gt;.

The first ever Olympic lottery scheme has been launched to the public in Britain, seven years to the day that the Olympics will be hosted to the City of London. 

A scratch card game will be one of the schemes that would be used to help make money for the Olympic Games in 2012. It is called "Go for Gold" and it costs £1 to buy. The actual amount that the National Lottery could give would be £1.5 billion pounds, but the lottery games would raise an estimated £750 million for sporting infrastructure.

Olympics Minister and Culture Secretary said the game was needed now to raise the cash necessary to develop the venues that will host the event.

She stated: "The Lottery needs to raise altogether £1.5 billion of which we estimate that £750 million over the seven years between now and the Games will come from the new Olympic lottery game." 

The games went on sale on Thursday.

&lt;a href="Mumbai"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;'s largest city and financial capital, received a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2005%20Maharashtra%20floods"&gt;record-high rainfall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on Tuesday, July 26. The rain left many parts of the city flooded. Landslides and other related effects of the rain claimed more than 100 lives in Mumbai and the surrounding areas.

Transportation was seriously affected, as the two main highways, railway lines, and the runways at Mumbai International airport remain submerged. 
Trains and city buses were shut down for 24 hours, and have not yet resumed full service. Domestic and international flights have been diverted out of Mumbai. Residents of buildings in low-lying areas are being rescued with boats and navy helicopters. Large numbers of Mumbai residents did not make it home from work, or spent the night in cars that were stranded on the road. The All India Radio reported that 150,000 people were stranded across different railway stations of the Mumbai Suburban Railway, which is considered the life line of Mumbai. Mumbai Suburban Railway partially commenced operating after thirty-six hours, from late evening on July 27.

The rainfall received in Mumbai's suburbs on Tuesday totaled 37.1 inches, which exceeds the world's record for highest rainfall in a single day (33.0 inches at Cherrapunji, Meghalaya, India).

The heavy rainfall has taken its toll on historic buildings as well. A building on Marine drive has been drowned up to the first floor. Mackichan Knight from IIMC mourns this irreparable damage.

As per Vilasrao Deshmukh, Chief Minister of &lt;a href="Maharashtra"&gt;Maharashtra&lt;/a&gt;, the rainfall cost the state $110m in damages.

♡❤♡Correction:♡❤♡ This does not exceed the world's record for highest rainfall in a single day, but it does exceed India's previous record. (33.0 inches at Cherrapunji, Meghalaya, India).

The world record for rainfall in a 24-hour period was 75.98in which fell during a hurricane on &lt;a href="Reunion%20Island"&gt;Reunion Island&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href="Madagascar"&gt;Madagascar&lt;/a&gt;.

The crew of the Space shuttle ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Discovery"&gt;Discovery&lt;/a&gt;♡❤&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; which &lt;a href="Space%20Shuttle%20Discovery%20launches"&gt;launched successfully yesterday&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; have begun to make inspections of the exterior of the Orbiter.

They are checking for any damage that may have occurred during take-off&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Columbia"&gt;Columbia&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Columbia%20disaster"&gt;was destroyed&lt;/a&gt; after a piece of &lt;a href="w%3Afoam"&gt;foam&lt;/a&gt; falling from the external fuel tank split open a wing, allowing super-heated &lt;a href="w%3Agas"&gt;gas&lt;/a&gt; to enter the craft upon &lt;a href="w%3AAtmospheric%20reentry"&gt;reentry&lt;/a&gt;, leading to its break-up.

The crew of ♡❤Discovery♡❤ are using a &lt;a href="w%3Alaser"&gt;laser&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3Ascanner"&gt;scanner&lt;/a&gt; mounted on the end of the shuttle's 15&amp;nbsp;m (49.2 ft) long &lt;a href="w%3Arobot"&gt;robotic&lt;/a&gt; arm. The inspection will consist of 90 minute sessions, during which a &lt;a href="w%3A3-D"&gt;three-dimensional&lt;/a&gt; image of the surface of the nosecone and the leading edges of the wings will be built up.

&lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; engineers are studying footage taken from a camera mounted on the external fuel tank, which appears to show a 1.5" (3.8&amp;nbsp;cm) piece of tile falling away from on or near the nose landing-gear doors. There is also footage of an unidentified piece of debris which fell away as the solid &lt;a href="w%3Abooster%20rocket"&gt;rocket boosters&lt;/a&gt; were jettisoned, and did not appear to strike the shuttle.

&lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; is lobbying the &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="US%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; to pass the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20America%20Free%20Trade%20Agreement"&gt;Central America Free Trade Agreement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (CAFTA), which is scheduled for a vote Wednesday night. The U.S. &lt;a href="US%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; passed the treaty in June.

Similar to the existing &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20American%20Free%20Trade%20Agreement"&gt;North American Free Trade Agreement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (NAFTA) among the U.S., &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Mexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, CAFTA would create a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Afree%20trade%20zone"&gt;free trade zone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; putting an end to most trade barriers between the United States and six additional countries, including &lt;a href="Costa%20Rica"&gt;Costa Rica&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="El%20Salvador"&gt;El Salvador&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Honduras"&gt;Honduras&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Guatemala"&gt;Guatemala&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Nicaragua"&gt;Nicaragua&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="Dominican%20Republic"&gt;Dominican Republic&lt;/a&gt;.

The free trade agreement faces stiff opposition among Democrats. Many Republicans who represent agricultural &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACorn%20Belt"&gt;Corn Belt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; or industrial &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARust%20Belt"&gt;Rust Belt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and southern textile states in Congress also have stated opposition to the bill. But with a Republican majority in the House large enough to ensure passage of CAFTA, party leaders are trying to shore up enough votes to ensure CAFTA's passage.

This has prompted last minute action by the President to lobby individual members of the House, reminding them that Central American countries have committed troops and other resources to fight the U.S. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWar%20on%20Terror"&gt;War on Terror&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Other Republican leaders have been using the party's traditional pro-business message and linking it to homeland security issues.

"Trade creates jobs and lifts people out of poverty and there's nothing like a stable society to fight terrorism and strengthen democracy, freedom and rule of law," &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADennis%20Hastert"&gt;Dennis Hastert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Speaker of the House, reportedly said at a news conference Tuesday. 

But the opposition disagrees. CAFTA is "a bad deal for Central Americans and also for Latinos in this community... (with CAFTA) the exploitation of workers will continue in Central America," Democrat Representative &lt;a href="Hilda%20Solis"&gt;Hilda Solis&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Los%20Angeles"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; said. Her views are common among Democrats, who are overwhelmingly against the treaty.

According to opponents of CAFTA, the current trend of American jobs being sent to foreign countries, particularly in the information technology sector, would greatly expand under the treaty.

"This will be a vote in the middle of the night. They'll keep the vote open for several hours, in violation of the rules. If it passes, it will be by fewer than five votes," predicted Rep. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASherrod%20Brown"&gt;Sherrod Brown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a Democrat from Ohio, according to a ♡❤Washington Post♡❤ report.

First leg of the second qualifications round of &lt;a href="w%3AUEFA%20Champions%20League"&gt;UEFA Champions League&lt;/a&gt; is now over. Second leg games will be played on August 2 and August 3. 

<h3>Selected match reports</h3>

The biggest surprise of the leg is probably Artmedia Bratislava's (also known as Artmedia Petrzalka) easy victory over Glasgow Celtic of 5 - 0. According to IFFHS' ratings, Celtic is 43rd on the list, while Slovakians are on position 200. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.iffhs.de/main/ranking/clubweltrangliste/%3Fsprache%3Ddeutsch"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

RSC Anderlacht secured an almost certain victory in the second round, as they won 5 - 0 at home against PFC Neftchi. 

Another clear favorite is Liverpool, which beat Kaunas in an with a final result of 1 - 3. Kaunas will have to score at least three goals at Anfield next week to stay in game.

Anorthosis made the same result against Trabzonspor, but at home, which can still give Turks realistic hope to make it up next week.

Dudelange lost at home to Rapid Vienna with 1 - 6. Strikers were on a goaling spree in the first ten minutes of the game, leaving Rapid with a steady advantage of 1 - 3. Akagündüz scored his second goal of the game in 16' for Rapid. Two more goals in the second half secured an easy home game for the Austrians.

<h3>Partizan boycotted by fans</h3>

Partizan Belgrade managed to beat Moldavian Sheriff at home, with 1 - 0, but the organized fans among 15,000 present at the stadium did not cheer for their team. Fans were protesting against the club management, as they banned any banners from the stadium. Most fans only chanted "Management out!" every few minutes.

Partizan's stadium has a capacity of 32,710 seats, but last season games avaraged only about 2000 spectators in domestic matches. There is a long standing conflict between Partizan's fans and the managament, as fans accuse the club leadership of manipulation of club's funds and favoring certain fan groups.

Dr. &lt;a href="w%3ATewolde%20Berhan%20Gebre%20Egziabher"&gt;Tewolde Berhan Gebre Egziabher&lt;/a&gt;, the Ethiopian government's chief scientist and its representative to the Montreal-based UN &lt;a href="w%3AConvention%20on%20Biological%20Diversity"&gt;Convention on Biological Diversity&lt;/a&gt; (CBD) had his passport returned without the requested Canadian visa, and without explanation. Dr. Tewolde is Africa's chief negotiator for the &lt;a href="w%3ACartagena%20Protocol%20on%20Biosafety"&gt;Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety&lt;/a&gt;. 

Tewolde had announced he would be visiting Montreal the first week of August to lobby for the labeling of &lt;a href="w%3AGenetically%20modified%20food"&gt;genetically modified&lt;/a&gt; (GM) seeds and food products and urge companies and governments to accept liability for environmental contamination their seeds could lead to. Canada has yet to ratify the UN biosafety protocol and opposes compulsory genetically modified labeling and liability.

Dr. Tewolde has worked against terminator technology (genetically-modified seed rendered sterile at harvest time, forcing farmers to buy new seeds each growing season). In the past, Dr. Tewolde has disagreed with Canadian scientists on proposed methods to regulate GM products.

"Dr. Tewolde is one of the most respected scientists in his field," said Pat Mooney, representative for the conservationist &lt;a href="http%3A//www.etcgroup.org/about.asp"&gt;ETC Group&lt;/a&gt; in Ottawa, "If the Canadian government can't make sure Dr. Tewolde has his visa for the opening of the meetings, Canada does not deserve to host the Convention on Biological Diversity."

Dr. Tewolde himself is concerned that Canada's actions signal a pattern, "Now that I have been prevented from coming to Montreal, who knows which ones of you will be prevented next time?" he wrote.

This closely mirrors another more recent incident where 12 Ugandans (mainly youths) were denied visas by the Canadian High Commission in Kenya. After making two applications and having met all the requirements asked by the commission, the Ugandan delegation was still denied visas.

The biggest &lt;a href="w%3Achild%20abuse"&gt;child abuse&lt;/a&gt; case in the history of &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, involving 45 abused children and 65 defendants, ended today with the conviction of all but three of the accused.

The court in &lt;a href="w%3AAngers"&gt;Angers&lt;/a&gt; handed down sentences ranging from four months suspended to 28 years for, among others, Philppe V., the key accused. The court found that he, along with his son Franck V. and Franck's former spouse, Patricia M., was one the instigators of a sex ring that abused 45 children, mostly in the couple's flat.

The abuses of children aged between six months and 12 years took place in a poor and deprived area of the western french town of Angers. Many of the defendants were poor and lived on benefits and some were mentally impaired. About 20 of them admitted to the charges, while others claimed to have never heard of a sex ring.

The &lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20Public%20Service%20Employees%20Union"&gt;Ontario Public Service Employees Union&lt;/a&gt; said it received a commitment that the provincially run liquor stores would not be sold, which was the main issue. Last week, workers voted 84 per cent against the latest contract offer from the LCBO, which called for raises of 11 per cent over four years to full-time staff.

<h1>Ties found between Abu Ghraib prison abuse and Guantanamo Bay</h1>

In testimony at a military hearing yesterday on abuses at the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; prison camp in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, the former warden of &lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Ghraib"&gt;Abu Ghraib&lt;/a&gt;, Maj. David Dinenna, said he attended in September 2003 a meeting with Maj. Gen. Geoffrey D. Miller, who was then commander of the &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20Bay"&gt;Guantanamo Bay&lt;/a&gt; prison camp. Maj. Dinenna said Gen. Miller recommended using dogs, because of their effectiveness. 

Two dog handler soldiers at Abu Ghraib stand accused in the hearing. Sgt. Santos A. Cardona, 31, and Sgt. Michael J. Smith, 24, are alleged to have used the dogs to threaten and intimidate prisoners. During the defendants' testimony on Tuesday, they said the interrogation techniques used by them on prisoners was learned from a team of interrogators that was dispatched to Iraq from the Guantanamo Bay military base in &lt;a href="w%3ACuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUniform%20Code%20of%20Military%20Justice"&gt;Article 32&lt;/a&gt; military court proceeding, which concluded Wednesday in &lt;a href="w%3AFort%20Meade"&gt;Fort Meade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMaryland"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt;, is a preliminary hearing to hear prosecution and defense arguments in the case. The Prosecution is seeking a court-martial with claims that the defendants acted criminally. The Defense contends the soldiers were following orders, and that the charges should be dropped.

The investigating officer of the military court, Maj. Glenn Simpkins, has two weeks to weigh the evidence that was presented. Some or all charges could be dropped, but if some charges stand, he will make a recommendation on how Sgts. Cardona and Smith should be dealt with when it goes to trial.

The two accused said in yesterday’s testimony that Col. Thomas M. Pappas, the top military intelligence officer at Abu Ghraib, approved the use of the dogs. Testimony was also heard from &lt;a href="w%3AIvan%20Frederick"&gt;Pvt. Ivan L. “Chip” Frederick&lt;/a&gt;, now serving an 8-year sentence in &lt;a href="w%3AFort%20Leavenworth"&gt;Fort Leavenworth&lt;/a&gt; for his role as ringleader in the abuse, who testified by phone from prison that approval was given to use the dogs, and that a civilian interrogator was also sometimes involved in directing which prisoner cells were to be visited by dog handlers.

In addition to the use of dogs, aggressive interrogation techniques such as clothing removal and sleep deprivation were also part of the series of abuses. Staff Sgt. James Vincent Lucas previously had told Army investigators in Guantanamo that he left Cuba in 2003 to go to Iraq where he, as a member of a 6-man team, taught the “lessons learned” at Guantanamo, and served to “provide guidelines” to interrogators at Abu Ghraib. 

Legislation sponsored by several &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republicans&lt;/a&gt; seeks to specifically regulate the treatment of prisoners at Guantanamo and other military prisons. A co-sponsor of the bill, &lt;a href="w%3ALindsey%20Graham"&gt;Lindsey Graham&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Carolina"&gt;SC&lt;/a&gt;), recently released declassified internal memos dating from 2003 and written by top military lawyers. They warned the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Depart%20of%20Defense"&gt;Pentagon&lt;/a&gt; about the aggressive tactics at Guantanamo. The memos noted it would heighten the dangers for U.S. troops caught by the enemy.

Army charge sheets accuse Cardona and Smith with maltreating detainees from November 15, 2003, to January 15, 2004 by "directing, encouraging, or permitting [their] unmuzzled military working dog[s] to bark and growl at detainees in order to unlawfully harass and threaten the detainees and in order to make the detainees urinate or defecate on themselves."

Cardona, of Fullerton, with the 42nd Military Police Detachment in Ft. Bragg, N.C., was charged with nine counts. Smith, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., with the 523rd Military Police Detachment in Ft. Riley, Kan., was charged with 14 counts.

<h1>Australian refugee activists plan protest during minister's speech</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Australian%20refugee%20activists%20plan%20protest%20during%20minister%27s%20speech&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Sydney refugee activists say that they will rally outside the building where Immigration Minister &lt;a href="w%3AAmanda%20Vanstone"&gt;Amanda Vanstone&lt;/a&gt; is giving a speech today. The minister will be speaking at the launch of an Immigrants’ Rights Kit.

Mark Goudkamp of the &lt;a href="w%3ARefugee%20Action%20Collective"&gt;Refugee Action Collective&lt;/a&gt;, quoted in a press release, argued that it was ironic that the minister was releasing a rights kit when she was responsible for violating the rights of asylum seekers.

"Vanstone oversees the denial of basic human rights for asylum seekers and refugees," he said. "How dare she offer her services at the launch of a publication advocating a better deal for migrants."

The Immigration Department has always maintained that Australia's &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20immigration%20detention%20facilities"&gt;immigration detention program&lt;/a&gt; and treatment of asylum seekers does not intentionally violate their rights, and in fact benefits a large number of people. On July 22 Senator Vanstone announced figures for the Government's Refugee and Humanitarian program, which included 13,100 visas for the 2004-2005 period.

"This demonstrates the Government’s strong and continuing commitment to providing new lives for refugees and those in humanitarian need under the Refugee and Humanitarian Program," the Minister said.

"Ninety two percent, or 12 096 visas, were granted offshore in 2004-05, ensuring that the majority of our efforts target those in the greatest need of resettlement, as determined by the United Nation’s High Commissioner for Refugees. This represents the largest offshore program since 1995-96"

Mr Goudkamp criticised the minister over recent scandals.
"Vanstone is in hot water over &lt;a href="w%3ACornelia%20Rau"&gt;Cornelia Rau&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AVivian%20Solon"&gt;Vivian Solon&lt;/a&gt;, the Hwang children and upwards of 200 other cases of wrongful detention," he said.

"Now we hear that Mahabub Alam, a Bangladeshi student with a valid visa, was subjected to a search without a warrant, arrest, interrogation and incarceration by immigration officers."

"Vanstone addressing this forum is sheer hypocrisy. Her reputation as immigration minister is beyond repair. &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; seems to be the only person in the country defending her."

He also called for the resignation of Senator Vanstone and her predecessor, current Attorney-General &lt;a href="w%3APhillip%20Ruddock"&gt;Phillip Ruddock&lt;/a&gt;.

"She must step down, taking Philip Ruddock, who was the hardline minister when many of these debacles occurred, with her," he said.

The Department also recently released figures on its skilled migration program, emphasising the benefits to the Australian economy, while not compromising other programs such as family reunion. 

"The 77,880 skill stream migrants in 2004-05 account for about 65 per cent of the total program. At 120,060, the overall Migration (non-Humanitarian) Program was the largest since the late 1980s," Senator Vanstone said.

"The Government's focus on skilled migration continues to benefit Australia’s economy, while it maintained a sizable level of family reunion," she said.

The rally will begin at the Market St entrance of the Queen Victoria Building at 5:30pm.

After intense discussion with a top Guard official, Dunn threatened to issue &lt;a href="w%3ASubpoena"&gt;subpoenas&lt;/a&gt; against numerous top National Guard officials in what he called "stonewalling" by the Guard.

At the capitol hearing, Dunn asked outside counsel for the Guard George O'Connell, "Does the Guard have files on U.S. citizens?" O'Connel responded, "Senator, I don't understand what you mean by files."

Dunn then repeated his question to National Guard Lt. Col. Joseph Righello. "I don't know," Righello responded.

The &lt;a href="U.S.%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;U.S. House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; approved the &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20American%20Free%20Trade%20Agreement"&gt;Central American Free Trade Agreement&lt;/a&gt; (CAFTA) early morning Thursday, with a narrow vote of 217 in favor, 215 against. Voting was held open for an hour, 45 minutes past the House's 15-minute voting rule as the &lt;a href="w%3APresident"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; along with other supporters lobbied into the night.

The vote was so close, if one House member changed a "Yea" vote to a "Nay" vote, CAFTA would have failed in a 216-216 tie. 

<h3>Republican vote breakdown</h3>
In tallying the votes, 25 &lt;a href="w%3ARepublicans"&gt;Republicans&lt;/a&gt;, mostly from &lt;a href="w%3AMidwest"&gt;Midwest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACorn%20Belt"&gt;Corn Belt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARust%20Belt"&gt;Rust Belt&lt;/a&gt; states and the Southeast &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;'s textile industrial belt, broke party line to vote against the measure. Two Republicans were present, but refused to vote. 

<h3>Democrat and Independent vote breakdown</h3>
The &lt;a href="w%3ADemocrats"&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt; presented a more united front. All but 15 Democrats present voted against the treaty. Independent House members, who usually vote with the Democrats also voted against the measure. 

Supporters of the measure include President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;, Vice President &lt;a href="Dick%20Cheney"&gt;Dick Cheney&lt;/a&gt;, U.S. Trade Representative Rob Portman and Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez. Opponents included most House Democrats.

The trade agreement already passed the &lt;a href="US%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; in June. President Bush has said he will sign it into law.

<ul>

Yasin Hassan Omar, 24 &amp;mdash; suspected of the attempted attack on Warren Street Tube Station &amp;mdash; has been arrested by police in Birmingham in a raid yesterday.

After being informed by a member of the public, police &amp;mdash; supported by an army bomb disposal team from the &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Logistic%20Corps"&gt;Royal Logistic Corps&lt;/a&gt; (RLC) &amp;mdash; launched a dawn raid at 04:30 am BST on a ground floor flat in Heybarnes Road that Omar was apparently staying in alone. According to the British tabloid newspaper "The Daily Mirror", Omar allegedly shouted at police to "Get back or I'll take you with me".

After a struggle ensued involving, it is believed, a rucksack that police feared was a bomb, Omar was shot in the bathroom by a 50,000-volt taser stun gun that temporarily disabled him. The rucksack was apparently thrown outside the window by police officers.

Around 100 homes were subsequently evacuated as a precautionary measure on the orders of the RLC bomb disposal team. The team then made a controlled explosion of the suspect package.

In a house in nearby Bankdale Road, three men, thought to be Somalis, were arrested and taken to a local police station.

Omar was later taken to &lt;a href="w%3APaddington%20Green%20police%20station"&gt;Paddington Green&lt;/a&gt;, West London, the Metropolitan Police's only high-security police station.

The flat in Birmingham remained guarded by police while forensic tests continued. 

Elsewhere, three women were arrested in Blair House in Stockwell, London in connection with the investigations into the attempted attacks on 21 July.
Early this morning, nine people were arrested under the Terrorism Act 2000 in raids on two houses in &lt;a href="w%3ATooting"&gt;Tooting&lt;/a&gt;, south London. None are believed to be the three remaining 21 July bombers at large.

<h1>Burundi radio station ban lifted as media council chair resigns</h1>

One of &lt;a href="w%3ABurundi"&gt;Burundi's&lt;/a&gt; most popular radio stations, "Radio Publique Africain", has been allowed to re-open. 

RPA was &lt;a href="Press%20freedom%20watchdog%20%27outraged%27%20by%20closure%20of%20Burundi%20radio%20station"&gt;forcibly shut down on Friday July 22&lt;/a&gt;, allegedly on the orders of President &lt;a href="w%3ADomitien%20Ndayizeye"&gt;Domitien Ndayizeye&lt;/a&gt;.

The move came just a day after RPA resumed broadcasting, having observed an earlier two-day ban, following a disagreement with Burundi's "National Communications Council" (CNC). 

The CNC had accused RPA of giving disproportionate coverage to the opposition FDD party, who heavily defeated Ndayizeye's FRODEBU party in last month's national elections. Ndayizeye is due to relinquish power in August. 

The radio station's Director, Alexis Sinduhije, had denied the CNC's charges. President Ndayizeye was quoted by BBC monitoring as saying that he had decided to close the radio station to "safeguard the integrity of state institutions."

The closure of RPA was condemned in Burundi, where the radio station, founded in 2001 to promote reconciliation between the &lt;a href="w%3AHutu"&gt;Hutu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATutsi"&gt;Tutsi&lt;/a&gt; ethnic groups, has a wide following. The US-based "&lt;a href="w%3ACommittee%20to%20Protect%20Journalists"&gt;Committee to Protect Journalists&lt;/a&gt;" led international condemnation of the ban, which Burundi's "Collectif des Professionels des Médias de la Diaspora Burundaise" described as an "abuse of power", setting up an online petition in protest. 

"The National Council of Communication judged that RPA has respected council sanctions, but we have also allowed the radio to reopen because a lot of people requested it," CNC chairman Jean Pierre Manda told Reuters, earlier this week.

Manda has now resigned, although he denies that the move is connected with the row over RPA, and cites "personal reasons". The Committee to Protect Journalists reports that the CNC is to be reformed, with Radio Publique Africain's Deputy Director sitting on the board in future. 

There is some confusion over when the ban was lifted, with Reporters Sans Frontieres and the Committee to Protect Journalists reporting that it remained in place until Wednesday this week, while Reuters claims that the ban was lifted on Monday. 

RPA Director Alexis Sinduhije has told Reuters that some of the radio station's material has been destroyed by the Burundian police, and suggested that broadcasting will not resume until a damage inventory has been taken.

This week's row is merely the latest manifestation of a long-running personal dispute between President Ndayizeye and the RPA Director Alexis Sinduhije, says journalist Gratien Rukindikiza, writing on the Burundian news website Burundi.news.free.fr. Rukindikiza traces the root of the affair to a telephone call last year in which Ndayizeye tried, unsuccessfully, to persuade Sinduhije to endorse his campaign, through Radio Publique Africain, to amend Burundi's constitution. The amendment would have allowed Ndayizeye to seek a second term in power, in contravention of a 2003 peace agreement.

&lt;a href="Real%20Madrid"&gt;Real Madrid&lt;/a&gt; star &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALuis%20Figo"&gt;Luis Figo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has stated that his move to &lt;a href="Liverpool%20F.C."&gt;Liverpool F.C.&lt;/a&gt; would be highly unlikely this summer.

Both Liverpool and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternazionale"&gt;Inter Milan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have been hard-hitting targets for the Portuguese midfielder this summer but it looks like Liverpool's bid to get the 32-year-old player, with contract and wages talks have been broken down "irrevocably", according to today's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Times"&gt;The Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

But it does look like Inter Milan do have the upper hand, in this Figo Saga, according to many newspapers.

Providing an update regarding his situation, Figo said: "With the English side (Liverpool), everything has ended but I'm happy many other big clubs have put their eyes on me - about Inter I have no news. 
"My situation is strange. I only want to play football, possibly with Real, but if I have no possibilities here it's better that I leave." 

This has come to a time where Figo, has flown with Real Madrid to there World Tour, in Japan and America.

The move comes after international pressure to decommission weapons and cease all violent activity, particularly after allegations regarding the murder of &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20McCartney%20%28murder%20victim%29"&gt;Robert McCartney&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AShort%20Strand"&gt;Short Strand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABelfast"&gt;Belfast&lt;/a&gt;, and a burglary of the &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Bank"&gt;Northern Bank&lt;/a&gt; in December of last year.

Members have been ordered to dump all arms and cease all paramilitary activity as of 16.00 BST (15.00 UTC) today, and the organisation's leadership states that it will pursue its aims through exclusively peaceful means. The statement reaffirms the IRA's view that its "armed struggle was entirely legitimate" as a means of pursuing the organisation's goal of a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Ireland"&gt;united Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, but states that many suffered during this conflict and that society is now compelled to build a lasting peace.

In its statement the IRA also appealed to the British government and Northern Irish Protestants to renew negotiations with them.

<h3>Reaction</h3>
 
Reaction to the statement has been mixed. 
<ul>
BULLET::::- "I think it has all the clarity that people have looked for this past 12 months. Of course there are lots of other issues in the peace process, which we have to continue to build on and build confidence on" &amp;mdash; &lt;a href="w%3ABertie%20Ahern"&gt;Bertie Ahern&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATaoiseach"&gt;Taoiseach&lt;/a&gt; (Irish Prime Minister)
BULLET::::- "This may be the day when finally, after all the false dawns and dashed hopes, peace replaced war, politics replaces terror on the island of Ireland. [...] It is what we have striven for and worked for throughout the eight years since the Good Friday Agreement." &amp;mdash; &lt;a href="Tony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom"&gt;Prime Minister of the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;
BULLET::::- "For the first time we have heard directly from the IRA not Sinn Fein that henceforward they are going to adopt peaceful means in seeking their political objectives" &amp;mdash; &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Mandelson"&gt;Peter Mandelson&lt;/a&gt;, European Union Commissioner, former Northern Ireland Secretary
BULLET::::- "11 years after the first IRA ceasefire these are the words that we needed and wanted to hear." &amp;mdash; &lt;a href="w%3AAlex%20Attwood"&gt;Alex Attwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASDLP"&gt;SDLP&lt;/a&gt;
BULLET::::- "I know there have been some who have been sceptical about whether republicans, the IRA in particular, were really interested in this process. I think today's statement shows that they are. The IRA doesn't have to do this. It is only doing this to try and give some assurance to those who are nervous or who are genuinely concerned. The IRA is not just stretching itself. It is actually overstretching itself to try to bring about the restoration of the peace process." &amp;mdash; &lt;a href="Gerry%20Adams"&gt;Gerry Adams&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASinn%20F%C3%A9in"&gt;Sinn Fein&lt;/a&gt; President

A doctor who worked at Children's Hospital of &lt;a href="w%3APittsburgh%2C%20Pennsylvania"&gt;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; will be charged with aggravated murder after her mother was found dead in the trunk of her car Wednesday, authorities in Ohio say. Dr. Malar Balasubramanian, 29, was found in &lt;a href="w%3ABlue%20Ash%2C%20Ohio"&gt;Blue Ash, Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, a suburb approximately 15 miles north of &lt;a href="w%3ACincinnati%2C%20Ohio"&gt;Cincinnati&lt;/a&gt; lying on the ground beside the road in a T-shirt and underwear in an apparently heavily medicated state. She directed officers to her black Oldsmobile Intrigue which was 500 feet away. There, they found the body of Saroja Balasubramanian, 53, covered with blood-stained blankets. Police said that the body appeared to have been there for about a day.

Dr. Malar Balasubramanian, formerly of the &lt;a href="w%3ASquirrel%20Hill"&gt;Squirrel Hill&lt;/a&gt; neighborhood of Pittsburgh, worked at Children's Hospital from June 2001 to June 2004, according to Melanie Finnigan, a hospital spokeswoman. She had recently returned from work in &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;'s unemployment rate fell by 0.1 percent in July, the Federal Labour Office said.

The number of jobless Germans dropped by 42 thousand to 4.8 million, but without seasonal adjustments, including summer breaks in job training and jobseeker holidays, it grew by 68 thousand and is close to a post-war record. Unemployment is projected to rise by 370 thousand by year end, according to German research institute IAB. 

Labour-market problems remain the main issue of the Bundestag election campaign. &lt;a href="w%3AChancellor%20of%20Germany"&gt;Chancellor&lt;/a&gt; Schröder's government is blamed for the failure of his social policy reform known as Hartz IV and growing unemployment. In recent polls the ruling &lt;a href="w%3ASocial%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany"&gt;Social Democrats&lt;/a&gt; (SPD) got 27 percent of the vote whilst the opposition &lt;a href="w%3AChristian-Democratic%20Union%20of%20Germany"&gt;Christian Democrats&lt;/a&gt; got 44 percent.

As a result of IBM's officially setting the withdrawal date of its &lt;a href="w%3AOS/2"&gt;OS/2&lt;/a&gt; operating system from the market, as well as its withdrawal of support, many OS/2 fans hope that the computer giant will release most or all of the operating system as &lt;a href="w%3Aopen%20source%20software"&gt;open source software&lt;/a&gt;.

Called the "&lt;a href="w%3ACarrie%20Bradshaw"&gt;Carrie Bradshaw&lt;/a&gt;" of bloggers by the ♡❤New York Times♡❤, Manhattanite &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New Yorker&lt;/a&gt; Stephanie Klein's online musings in her personal blog, ♡❤Greek Tragedy♡❤, has gained the attention of &lt;a href="w%3AHollywood"&gt;Hollywood&lt;/a&gt; and the book industry while it draws comparisons to former &lt;a href="w%3AHBO"&gt;HBO&lt;/a&gt; television series, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASex%20and%20the%20City"&gt;Sex and the City&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

Since January 2004, Klein has written her blog which goes into the intimate details of her life as a 29-year-old professional divorced single woman living on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, one of New York City's most upscale neighborhoods. Since then her blog has become among the top 1 percent most-read blogs in the world, according to &lt;a href="w%3ATechnorati"&gt;Technorati&lt;/a&gt;'s "net attention" ratings system.

That popularity grabbed the attention of two international media conglomerates, &lt;a href="w%3ANews%20Corporation"&gt;News Corporation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANBC%20Universal"&gt;NBC Universal&lt;/a&gt;. News Corp.'s &lt;a href="w%3AHarperCollins"&gt;HarperCollins&lt;/a&gt; book division struck a book deal with Klein valued at more than $500,000. The book is scheduled to debut in April 2006.

Comparisons to ♡❤Sex and the City♡❤ may continue, as NBC Universal is developing the blog-based book into a fictionalized weekly sitcom version of Klein’s life for its &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Broadcasting%20Company"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt; television network.

Environmental groups have condemned the deal, claiming that, as it is not legally binding, it is no substitute for the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKyoto%20Protocol"&gt;Kyoto Protocol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which the US and Australia refuse to sign. China and India - along with some 140 other countries - have already ratified the Kyoto agreement, but did not have to set a target for reducing gas emissions due to their status as developing countries. The Kyoto Protocol has the firm target of reducing emissions by 5.2% on 1990 levels before 2010.

Answering critics, the Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said, "We are not trying to detract from Kyoto and the commitments that a number of countries have made under the Kyoto Protocol. This partnership will complement and not replace the Kyoto Protocol."

The Australian Prime Minister John Howard also said that his country should not pursue renewable technologies, but should instead concentrate in reducing emissions from the use of coal. Australia is the world's largest exporter of coal, and Howard said that "Australia [should not be] unreasonably penalising herself by saying, in effect, we're going to try to move away from the use of fuels in which Australia has a natural advantage."

However part of the deal includes setting up a fund to further research cleaner energy technologies, including more efficient use of fossil fuels as well as renewable technologies, and also methods of trapping and storing greenhouse gasses rather than releasing them to the atmosphere. It is hoped that this will aid China, India and other developing countries to adopt cleaner energy solutions.

The details will be worked out at a meeting between the six countries in November, shortly before the next UN summit on climate change.

The countries believe the deal is fairer and more effective than the Kyoto Protocol. However, a &lt;a href="Greenpeace"&gt;Greenpeace&lt;/a&gt; spokesperson said, "The suggested scheme is, unlike Kyoto, a voluntary scheme, and all evidence shows that voluntary schemes do not work. Skulking around making secretive, selective deals will not accomplish a reduction in emissions ."

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUN"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIntergovernmental%20Panel%20on%20Climate%20Change"&gt;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has warned that global temperatures could rise by 1.4C to as much as 5.8C by 2100. The US and China are the two biggest producers of carbon dioxide (a major greenhouse gas) in the world.

&lt;a href="NASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; has said that preliminary investigations show that ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Discovery"&gt;Discovery&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ is safe to fly home. 

Final findings will not be available for several days as a team of 200 experts study all video and stills footage taken of the shuttle during launch, and on approach to the &lt;a href="International%20Space%20Station"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt; (ISS), with which ♡❤Discovery♡❤ docked earlier today.

Images from new cameras have revealed that a section of &lt;a href="w%3AFoam"&gt;foam&lt;/a&gt; weighing some 250&amp;nbsp;g fell away from the &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20shuttle%20external%20tank"&gt;external fuel tank&lt;/a&gt; during launch, but did not strike the Orbiter. However, NASA has announced the grounding of all further planned Shuttle launches until they have a firm understanding of why the foam comes away, and what to do about it.

A piece of foam striking the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Columbia"&gt;Columbia&lt;/a&gt;♡❤&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s wing during take-off in January 2003 was responsible for the &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Columbia%20disaster"&gt;loss of the craft&lt;/a&gt; as it made its &lt;a href="w%3AAtmospheric%20reentry"&gt;reentry&lt;/a&gt; to Earth's atmosphere.

As part of the check for damage the crew of ♡❤Discovery♡❤ used a laser-scanner on the robotic arm to inspect the &lt;a href="Crew%20of%20Discovery%20inspect%20Shuttle%20for%20launch%20damage"&gt;craft's wing leading-edges and nosecone&lt;/a&gt;. The belly of the Orbiter will be checked later this week.

In a first, the Shuttle also performed a slow back-flip in some 180&amp;nbsp;m from the ISS enabling the two-man crew of the space station to take high-resolution images of the underside of the Orbiter.

Sir John's pro Anglo-Saxon rhetoric has not gone unnoticed. Ekow Eshun of the Newstatesman writes that Major's comments belong on the dustheap of history along with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acricket"&gt;cricket&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The former British leader has also been recently quoted as saying in reference to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazilian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; citizen killed by police; "I rather prefer the expression shoot to protect rather than shoot to kill &amp;mdash; I think that is a more accurate description of what happened."

In addition Sir John has come out as an advocate of deportation for people who express distaste for the "Anglo-Saxon way of life". The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASaudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ambassador to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Prince &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATurki%20al-Faisal"&gt;Turki al-Faisal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , is voicing the same position as Major regarding the need for deporting some of the Muslim clerics. In the 1960s there was born a somewhat similar "America, love it or leave it" viewpoint among &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; conservatives, a viewpoint that is still the subject of debate today.

Officials said that at least 20 people were injured as a mini-&lt;a href="w%3Atornado"&gt;tornado&lt;/a&gt; (more correctly, a &lt;a href="w%3AWhirlwind"&gt;whirlwind&lt;/a&gt;) swept through &lt;a href="w%3ABirmingham"&gt;Birmingham&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday. People made temporarily homeless by the storm sought shelter at a local university. 

Some homes could be beyond repair, and may have to be bulldozed.

The British Meteorological Office has estimated that the tornado had either a T3 or a T4 &lt;a href="w%3ATORRO%20scale"&gt;rating&lt;/a&gt; (Or F1 on the &lt;a href="w%3AFujita%20scale"&gt;Fujita Scale&lt;/a&gt;), which would mean that wind speeds of between 93 and 130 miles per hour swept through the UK's second-largest city. An area of approximately one km² in &lt;a href="w%3AKings%20Heath"&gt;Kings Heath&lt;/a&gt; was damaged.

A Met Office spokesperson told the BBC: "We have an average of 33 reports of tornadoes in the UK each year but these are especially rare in built-up areas and there has not been one of this strength in many years."

Birmingham City Council set up emergency shelters in &lt;a href="w%3AAston%20University"&gt;Aston University&lt;/a&gt; for those whose homes were damaged. According to a spokesperson from the Ambulance Service, 20 patients were removed to Heartlands Hospital, Selly Oak Hospital, and &lt;a href="w%3ADudley"&gt;Dudley&lt;/a&gt;.

The student visa of &lt;a href="w%3AJean%20Charles%20de%20Menezes"&gt;Jean Charles de Menezes&lt;/a&gt;, 27, had expired two-years ago, according to the British Home Office.

Government officials state that he arrived in the UK on 13 March 2002 and was granted a six-month tourist visa and later applied for a student visa which was granted, allowing him to stay in the country until 30 June 2003. 

It is also suggested in the Home Office statement that the visa had a forged "indefinite leave to remain" stamp on it, saying that the style of the stamp was not in use at the time it was apparently meant to have been issued.

This has led to speculation that this may be a reason why de Menezes &amp;mdash; who was mistakenly believed to have terrorist connections &amp;mdash; fled after being confronted by police (not in uniform) at Stockwell tube station. He was shot eight times by the police &amp;mdash; seven times in the head and once in the shoulder.

His family had said that they believed that de Menezes' visa had been renewed for an additional five-years.

In the statement made by the Home Office spokeswoman, it was denied that the information released would influence the investigation, saying: "This information is not intended in any way to prejudice or influence the independent investigation into the circumstances of Mr De Menezes' death, or any possible future proceedings."
The killing of de Menezes is being investigated by the &lt;a href="w%3AIndependent%20Police%20Complaints%20Commission"&gt;Independent Police Complaints Commission&lt;/a&gt; (IPCC), standard procedure for fatal shootings.

The body of Mr de Menezes was returned to Brazil on 27 July.

He is to be buried today in his home town of &lt;a href="w%3AGonzaga%2C%20Minas%20Gerais"&gt;Gonzaga&lt;/a&gt; in the state of &lt;a href="w%3AMinas%20Gerais"&gt;Minas Gerais&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Medical%20Association"&gt;Australian Medical Association&lt;/a&gt; (A.M.A.), an independent organization representing over 27,000 doctors, has written a letter to the Australian Government's Biofuels Taskforce supporting the mandatory use of ethanol blends.

“The A.M.A. is a strong advocate on initiatives related to environmental impacts on human health such as &lt;a href="w%3Aglobal%20warming"&gt;global warming&lt;/a&gt;,” wrote Dr Haikerwal, President of the A.M.A. .

“In our opinion, there is incontrovertible evidence that the addition of &lt;a href="w%3Aethanol"&gt;ethanol&lt;/a&gt; to petrol and &lt;a href="w%3Abiodiesel"&gt;biodiesel&lt;/a&gt; to diesel will reduce the deaths and ill-health associated with the emissions produced by burning those fuels.” The A.M.A. has recommended the use of petrol with 10% ethanol and diesel with 20% biodiesel.

The A.M.A. also indicated its support for the reduction of toxic &lt;a href="w%3Aaromatics"&gt;aromatics&lt;/a&gt; (such as &lt;a href="w%3Abenzene"&gt;benzene&lt;/a&gt;), increased use of &lt;a href="w%3Aliquified%20petroleum%20gas"&gt;liquid petroleum gas&lt;/a&gt; (LPG) or &lt;a href="w%3Acompressed%20natural%20gas"&gt;compressed natural gas&lt;/a&gt; (CNG), and the use of filters and gas-detoxification systems in vehicle tunnels.

Two days of ministerial talks have ended without agreement and evidence of a possible deadlock between developing and developed countries. 

148 member countries are trying to reach a consensus on how to proceed with the Doha round of talks which are scheduled to be agreed in 2006. However, they are now behind the deadlines they set and the Geneva meeting saw no progress. 

Richer countries are being accused of demanding too many concessions in return for opening up trade and reducing subsidies while they say that the poorer countries are holding them to ransom by blocking progress.

Armed police officers from &lt;a href="w%3ASO19"&gt;SO19&lt;/a&gt; have raided properties in the &lt;a href="w%3ANotting%20Hill"&gt;Notting Hill&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Kensington"&gt;North Kensington&lt;/a&gt; areas of London and Italian forces have arrested the fourth bombing suspect at a property in &lt;a href="w%3ARome"&gt;Rome, Italy&lt;/a&gt;. The raids were in connection with the &lt;a href="Four%20small%20explosions%20strike%20London%27s%20transport%20system"&gt;failed bombings on July 21&lt;/a&gt;.

Scotland Yard have announced that a number of arrests have been made, and that three of the suspected July 21 bombers are now in custody. The most recently arrested suspects are reported to be those wanted in connection with the Oval tube and London bus bombing attempts &lt;a href="http%3A//news.bbc.co.uk./1/hi/uk/4727975.stm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Officers in full body armour, helmets and gas masks and armed with shotguns and assault rifles were seen moving in. Small explosions were heard soon after, and &lt;a href="w%3ACS%20gas"&gt;CS gas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AStun%20grenade%23Concussion%20grenades"&gt;stun grenades&lt;/a&gt; are also believed to have been used. Police are cautioning that CS grenade launchers and explosive entries could be mistaken for shots, and have said that no shots were fired.

Police at one point described the raid as entering a "challenging phase". Eyewitnesses said that the police asked one person in a building that was surrounded to give himself up. They apparently addressed the person as "Muhammad" &lt;a href="http%3A//news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4727975.stm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AMuktar%20Said%20Ibrahim"&gt;Muktar Said Ibrahim&lt;/a&gt;, one of two suspects named after the failed 21 July bombing attempts, is also known as Muhammad. The other officially-named suspect has already been &lt;a href="21%20July%20London%20bombing%20suspect%20held"&gt;arrested in Birmingham&lt;/a&gt;.

At one point the cordon around the area was expanded, cutting off TV news stations from their broadcast vehicles which were caught inside the sealed-off area.

Two weeks before the failed attacks of July 21, a &lt;a href="Coordinated%20terrorist%20attack%20hits%20London"&gt;series of bombs&lt;/a&gt; on July 7 killed 56 people, including four suicide bombers.

<h3>More arrests</h3>
Two women have also been arrested at Liverpool Street station, but it is not clear if the arrests are in connection with terrorism. Both the surface and underground stations were evacuated and were searched, but have now re-opened.

According to three news wires, the fourth London bombing suspect &amp;mdash; just named as &lt;a href="w%3AHussain%20Osman"&gt;Hussain Osman&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; has been arrested by Italian police in Rome.

The arrest has been confirmed by the Italian Minister of the Interior. Hussein is a UK citizen who was born in Somalia, and later moved to Britain and naturalized. 

It comes as &lt;a href="Armed%20police%20arrest%20two%20more%20July%2021%20bombing%20suspects%20in%20dramatic%20raids"&gt;two bombing suspects were arrested today in West London&lt;/a&gt;, and one &lt;a href="21%20July%20London%20bombing%20suspect%20held"&gt;in Birmingham on 27 July&lt;/a&gt;.

In what some consider a tasteless follow-up to the recent bombs in the London transport system, misleading stories are circulating by email of a "new facility" which allegedly would allow mobile phones to operate from the underground tunnels in case of an emergency. This is, of course, not true, as no "leeky feeder" system or similar is currently installed on the system.

Fuller details are now available from BBC website.

The definition of what is and what is not a planet is being challenged by a newly announced discovery Friday. Astronomers from the &lt;a href="w%3APalomar%20Observatory"&gt;Palomar Observatory&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Diego%2C%20California"&gt;San Diego, California&lt;/a&gt; said they found a chunk of ice and rock in the solar system larger than &lt;a href="w%3APluto%20%28planet%29"&gt;Pluto&lt;/a&gt;.

The object, given the temporary generic name of &lt;a href="w%3A2003%20UB313"&gt;2003 UB&lt;/a&gt;, is about 9 billion miles away from the sun. It was first photographed in 2003 using the &lt;a href="w%3AGemini%20Observatory"&gt;Gemini Observatory&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AHawaii"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;. But it was an indistinguishable bright spot among a field of stars in an area of the sky where astronomers don't usually look at for planets or planet-type objects.

Solar system bodies found beyond the orbit of &lt;a href="w%3ANeptune%20%28planet%29"&gt;Neptune&lt;/a&gt; are called "&lt;a href="w%3Atrans-Neptunian%20object"&gt;trans-Neptunian objects&lt;/a&gt;". One of them, &lt;a href="w%3APluto%20%28planet%29"&gt;Pluto&lt;/a&gt;, is also classified as a planet. Up until now all other planet-like discoveries beyond Neptune, including &lt;a href="w%3ASedna%20%28planet%29"&gt;Sedna&lt;/a&gt;, found by the same Palomar team in 2004, are called &lt;a href="w%3AKuiper%20Belt%20object"&gt;Kuiper Belt object&lt;/a&gt;s, or minor planets.

<h3>Size matters</h3>
Using a photo taken on January 8, the Palomar team compared it with previous 2003 UB photos to triangulate the object's distance, brightness and orbit.

Using mathematical formulas, they found a range of sizes for 2003 UB, with an estimated average showing the approximate diameter of the new body to be about 2,600 kilometers. But even at the smallest estimate scientists are certain 2003 UB is larger than Pluto's 2,250 kilometer diameter.

To determine size, Scientists deduce the relative size of a solar system object by its brightness, just as one can infer the size of a faraway light bulb if one knows its wattage. The reflectance of 2003 UB is not yet known for sure. Scientists can not yet tell how much light from the sun is reflected away from its surface, but the amount of light the planet does reflect puts a lower limit on its size.

"Even if it reflected 100 percent of the light reaching it, it would still be as big as Pluto," Michael E. Brown, a professor of planetary astronomy at the California Institute of Technology said in a NASA press release. "I'd say it's probably one and a half times the size of Pluto, but we're not sure yet of the final size."

"We are 100 percent confident that this is the first object bigger than Pluto ever found in the outer solar system," Brown added.

<h3>Why wasn't it discovered earlier?</h3>

The object is inclined by a whopping 45 degrees to the main plane of the solar system, where most of the other planets orbit. That's why it eluded discovery: nobody was looking there until now, Brown said.

Most objects in the solar system are just a few degrees from the main plane of the solar system, called the &lt;a href="w%3AEcliptic"&gt;Ecliptic&lt;/a&gt;. Pluto, which is considered substantially different from the rest of the planets, is only 17 degrees from this main plane. Astronomers who study the sky for asteroids and comets usually look in the region of the sky that the rest of the planets occupy.

The brightness of this object is just barely fainter than the telescopes from earlier sky surveys were able to identify, so new advances in the making of telescopes has also played a part in this discovery.

<h3>The name</h3>

Now that the discovery data has been released, the scientists will turn over their work to the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Astronomical%20Union"&gt;International Astronomical Union&lt;/a&gt; (IAU), which will review it, classify the object and approve a new name to replace the temporary 2003 UB. 

Sometimes the discoverers of a new planetary body get to choose its name, but not always. "We have a name we really like, and we want it to stick," Brown told reporters at a press conference. He said the team has submitted the name to the IAU but would not disclose their choice. In the 2004 naming of Sedna, Brown noted objects found in the Kuiper Belt are usually named after deities of the Underworld. 

The astronomers have been using a code name of sorts for the discovery. The tongue-in-cheek nickname is "&lt;a href="w%3AXena"&gt;Xena&lt;/a&gt;" after the fictional main character of the television series of the same name. "Because we always wanted to name something Xena," Dr. Brown said in a ♡❤New York Times♡❤ report.

<h3>Defining 'planet'</h3>
There has been controversy in the scientific community about what is and what is not a planet. Some purists insist the Solar system has only eight planets and that Kuiper Belt object including Pluto, Sedna and 2003 UB cannot be listed among the major planets.

A minor furor erupted when the IAU suggested removing Pluto from the pantheon of planets a few years ago. Because of that Pluto's status as a "planet" in addition to being a Kuiper Belt object was cemented. But with the discovery of 2003 UB the "planet or not" debate may rekindle.

"Pluto has been a planet for so long that the world is comfortable with that," Brown said in the teleconference. "It seems to me a logical extension that anything bigger than Pluto and farther out is a planet."

Offering additional justification, Brown said 2003 UB appears to be surfaced with methane ice, as is Pluto. That's not the case with other large Kuiper Belt objects, however.

"This object is in a class very much like Pluto," he said.

<h3>A second object found</h3>
The new "10th planet" was not the only new discovery in the Kuiper Belt this past week. &lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9-Luis%20Ortiz"&gt;José-Luis Ortiz&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3ASierra%20Nevada%20Observatory"&gt;Sierra Nevada Observatory&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASpain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; announced the discovery of an object called &lt;a href="w%3A2003%20EL61"&gt;2003 EL&lt;/a&gt;. This object, thought to be larger than Sedna, is the brightest trans-Neptune object next to Pluto.

Although some news media confused the discovery of 2003 EL with 2003 UB, they are different objects.

2003 EL is so bright, it can be seen with high-end amateur-grade telescopes equipped with &lt;a href="w%3ACCD%20camera"&gt;CCD camera&lt;/a&gt;s. Although this second discovery may not be as large as 2003 UB, scientists have confirmed that 2003 EL has its own moon.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense"&gt;U.S. Department of Defense (DoD)&lt;/a&gt; has announced that eleven bases in &lt;a href="w%3ABavaria"&gt;Bavaria&lt;/a&gt; are to close by 2007, with two further bases being handed over later. The closures are the first step that will see 50,000 troops withdrawn from Europe and South Korea. The U.S. has 181,061 troops stationed in Western Europe and the Far East. 
&lt;a href="w%3ANATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; has been present in Germany since the end of World War II and its presence played an important role in the Cold War, when Germany was split into &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Germany"&gt;West Germany&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Germany"&gt;East Germany&lt;/a&gt;.

The U.S. and U.K. are the only remaining powers that maintain large forces in the country. The U.S. presently has 75,603 personnel in southern Germany while the British have some 55,000 personnel based in &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Rhine-Westphalia"&gt;North Rhine-Westphalia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALower%20Saxony"&gt;Lower Saxony&lt;/a&gt; as part of &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Forces%20Germany"&gt;British Forces Germany&lt;/a&gt;. 

It is planned that the U.S. Army's &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%201st%20Infantry%20Division"&gt;1st Infantry Division&lt;/a&gt; will move back to the U.S. in 2006. Some units of &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20V%20Corps"&gt;V Corps&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Seventh%20Army"&gt;U.S. Army Europe&lt;/a&gt; will also be returned. It is estimated that the move will affect 6,100 soldiers, 11,000 family members, 1,000 Department of the Army civilians and 1,000 locally employed civilians.

The DoD said in its statement that: "These changes are part of the Department of Defense’s overall plan (the Integrated Global Presence and Basing Strategy) to transform the military to increase strategic responsiveness and flexibility in the face of current and anticipated future threats, and are the result of extensive consultation with our German allies."

It has been confirmed by a British consulate spokeswoman in Iraq that an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) attack on a British consulate convoy took place at 09:30 am local time.

The attack happened on the outskirts of Basra and is reported to have killed two British security contractors and wounded two Iraqi civilians.

The two British contractors were killed in the first blast that took place in close proximity to the vehicle they were in. According to the BBC World Affairs correspondent &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Simpson"&gt;John Simpson&lt;/a&gt;, two Iraqi children were injured after a second explosion occurred while Iraqi civilians were attempting to help the convoy. 

The nationality the two contractors was confirmed by their employers, Control Risks Group.
At least one car was destroyed and British Army soldiers later arrived to secure the scene.

, has won a record European lottery win on the EuroMillions cross-European lottery draw. Delores McNamara won €115.6 million, tax-free in the game, after the jackpot had rolled over un-won for 9 weeks.

The Garryowen woman will have to wait until at least Tuesday, August 2nd, to claim her winnings, as the Irish National Lottery offices are closed for the August Bank Holiday.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUFCW"&gt;United Food and Commercial Workers International Union&lt;/a&gt; broke away from the &lt;a href="w%3AAFL-CIO"&gt;American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations&lt;/a&gt; (AFL-CIO), making it the third union to split from the AFL-CIO this week over disagreements about how to revive labor's diminishing influence.

The departure of the &lt;a href="w%3AUFCW"&gt;UFCW&lt;/a&gt;, along with two other unions, the&lt;a href="w%3ATeamsters"&gt;Teamsters&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AService%20Employees%20International%20Union"&gt;Service Employees International&lt;/a&gt; unions from the AFL-CIO means it is losing more than 4 million of its 13 million members.

Union membership in the U.S. has been declining for many years, and the breakaway unions want to commit more money to recruiting members. They complain that the AFL-CIO has spent too much money on backing political candidates, particularly Democrats, instead of organizing labor.

UFCW President Joe Hansen wrote to AFL-CIO President &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20J.%20Sweeney"&gt;John J. Sweeney&lt;/a&gt; saying: "Tradition and past success are not sufficient to meet the new challenges."

AFL-CIO spokeswoman Lane Windham responded, saying "The UFCW leadership decision to leave the AFL-CIO, especially when working people are up against the most powerful, anti-worker corporate and governmental forces in 80 years, is a tragedy for working families. Only unions' enemies win when unions split our strength."

"The unions that split from the AFL-CIO now face the challenge of having to work together to maximize the power of labor," predicted Harley Shaiken, a professor of labor issues at UC Berkley.

Their clearest difference is in how they want a national labor organization to operate, Shaiken said. The breakaway unions favor a more authoritative federation that can compel member unions to act on its directives.

The departure is part of the biggest rift in organized labor &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Federation%20of%20Labor%23The%20CIO"&gt;since 1938&lt;/a&gt;, when the &lt;a href="w%3ACongress%20of%20Industrial%20Organizations"&gt;CIO&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACongress%20of%20Industrial%20Organizations%23Founding%20of%20the%20CIO"&gt;split&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Federation%20of%20Labor"&gt;AFL&lt;/a&gt;. 

When the groups &lt;a href="w%3ACongress%20of%20Industrial%20Organizations%23Merger%20with%20the%20AFL"&gt;merged&lt;/a&gt; to form the AFL-CIO in the 1950s, one of every three private-sector workers belonged to a labor union. Today, fewer than 8 percent of private-sector workers are unionized.

&lt;a href="w%3ALibya"&gt;Libya&lt;/a&gt; gave &lt;a href="w%3AUS"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href="w%3AOccidental%20Petroleum%20Corporation"&gt;Occidental Petroleum Corporation&lt;/a&gt; permission to resume business there for the first time in 19 years. 

The company abandoned operations in the mid 1980's due to &lt;a href="w%3Asanctions"&gt;sanctions&lt;/a&gt; imposed on Libya by the United States.

The sanctions, enforced by &lt;a href="w%3ARonald%20Reagan"&gt;Ronald Reagan&lt;/a&gt;'s administration in &lt;a href="w%3A1986"&gt;1986&lt;/a&gt;, were in response to Libya's backing of &lt;a href="w%3Aterrorist"&gt;terrorist&lt;/a&gt; activities. The sanctions were lifted in &lt;a href="w%3A2004"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;, giving the &lt;a href="w%3AUS"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; companies opportunity to return.

&lt;a href="w%3AOccidental%20Petroleum"&gt;Occidental&lt;/a&gt; is the first US oil company to resume operations in &lt;a href="w%3ALibya"&gt;Libya&lt;/a&gt;. Daily output from their &lt;a href="w%3AOil%20well"&gt;wells&lt;/a&gt; is expected to be 12,000 - 15,000 barrels per day.

Beginning May 28, 2005, ultra-marathon cyclist Arvid Loewen cycled 7,000 km in 30 days across &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; raising money and awareness for an orphanage, MCF, in . Cycling 240 km a day, Arvid began in &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20Rock%2C%20British%20Columbia"&gt;White Rock, British Columbia&lt;/a&gt;, and finished on June 26 in &lt;a href="w%3AHalifax%2C%20Nova%20Scotia"&gt;Halifax, Nova Scotia&lt;/a&gt;. 

MCF, or Mully Children's Family, was founded by Charles Mulli, a man who was abandoned on the streets in Kenya at the age of six. He fought through life on the streets and subsequently became wealthy. He sold all his wealth and businesses and began an orphanage in his own home. That orphanage is now home to over 800 children. 

Loewen, 48, cycled 12-14 hours a day, pushing through just about every weather possible. His biggest challenge to date has raised close to $100,000 (CA) and will hopefully continue. Riding on the back of his specially modified tandem bicycle was a rotating group of three Kenyan orphans, just 3 of the many whose lives have been changed. They took turns being pulled across the country by Loewen.

The Metropolitan Police Service has questioned the suspects of the foiled July 21 bombing attacks. They are also seeking extradition of a fifth suspect from Rome.

Osman Hussain, 27, the suspect in Rome allegedly told investigators that the explosives he was carrying was not enough to even "harm people nearby." He also is reported to have said that "We were supposed to blow ourselves up."

The suspected bombers in the attacks were all from the war-torn East African countries of &lt;a href="w%3AEritrea"&gt;Eritrea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AEthiopia"&gt;Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASomalia"&gt;Somalia&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;a href="Egypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;ian &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ariot%20police"&gt;riot police&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and government supporters have dispersed Saturday demonstration against President &lt;a href="Hosni%20Mubarak"&gt;Hosni Mubarak&lt;/a&gt;'s fifth re-election campaign.

Several hundred demonstrators from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKifaya"&gt;Kifaya&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a movement against re-election of Mr Mubarak, as well as from other pro-reform organisations were to gather in &lt;a href="Cairo"&gt;Cairo&lt;/a&gt;'s main square, but they were attacked by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Asecurity%20forces"&gt;security forces&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aplain-clothes%20police"&gt;plain-clothes police&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on their way.

Eyewitnesses reported that the protesters were beaten, kicked in the head, and finally thrown into police trucks.

19 members of Kifaya were arrested and they are still held, according to the organisation statement. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAyman%20Barakat"&gt;Ayman Barakat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Mr Mubarak's most serious opponent in the upcoming election was among those arrested, but is now freed.

Mr Mubarak announced that he would stand in the election on Thursday. Under international pressure he introduced several serious &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aconstitutional%20reforms"&gt;constitutional reforms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , including first in 24 years presidential elections with more than one candidate. However, opposition leaders say that is 'no guarantee' the elections will be fair.

U.S. president released the results of high annual medical checkup July 31. The doctors said the president was in "excellent health".

The doctors did note some minor skin lesions from spending too much time in the sun and suggested sunscreen for the President. 

It is U.S. tradition for sitting presidents to make public the results of their annual health exams.

Wim Duisenberg, the former head of the European Central Bank, has been found dead in his swimming pool at his house in south-east France, the French police say. No details were given about the cause of 70-year-old Mr Duisenberg's death. 

However this was disputed by his wife, Gretta Duisenberg. She says she found her husband just outside the study in their villa and not in their swimming pool. 

The former Dutch finance minister was the ECB's first president, and oversaw the introduction of the single European currency, the euro.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Garang"&gt;John Garang&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , recently sworn in as Vice President of the &lt;a href="Sudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt;, was confirmed dead after his helicopter disappeared yesterday. Sudanese state television initially reported him to be alive but it now appears Mr. Garang died after his helicopter crashed.

Garang became Vice President in a historic deal, which ended the southern rebellion after 20 years of fighting. The deal created a government of national unity, giving hope to many that problems endemic to the region, including the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJanjaweed"&gt;Janjaweed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; militia in &lt;a href="Darfur"&gt;Darfur&lt;/a&gt;, could finally be solved and that the &lt;a href="Muslim"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; north could come to liveable terms with the &lt;a href="Christian"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Sudan"&gt;south&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Garang was making an official trip to &lt;a href="Uganda"&gt;Uganda&lt;/a&gt; when bad weather struck; his helicopter had not arrived at its destination and was out of contact leading many to fear the worst.

The BBC reports that "large-scale" rioting has broken out in the Sudanese capital &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKhartoum"&gt;Khartoum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , with supporters of Mr. Garang battling armed police. Disturbances are also reported in the south of the country. Some southerners believe that the Sudanese authorities were behind the crash, according to USA Today, which draws parallels with the shooting down of a plane carrying &lt;a href="Rwanda"&gt;Rwanda&lt;/a&gt;'s President Habyarimana in 1994. Habyarimana's assassination helped trigger Rwanda's infamous &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARwandan%20Genocide"&gt;genocide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , recently portrayed in the movie "Hotel Rwanda". 

Garang's party, the Sudan People's Liberation Movement, has appealed for calm, insisting that his death was an accident.

In a press release published on the website Allafrica.com, Uganda's President Museveni appeared to be keeping an open mind about the circumstances of the crash, which he says took place on the Ugandan-Sudanese border. "The helicopter was a recently overhauled executive helicopter that has served us well for the last 8 Years", he is quoted as saying, detailing a number of technical improvements recently made to the craft. In the same statement, Museveni announces the creation of a panel of experts to investigate the crash. "We have also approached a certain foreign government to rule out any form of sabotage or terrorism", he says.

According to the Sunday Times, &lt;a href="w%3ASlobodan%20Milo%C5%A1evi%C4%87"&gt;Slobodan Milošević&lt;/a&gt;, a former Serbian President currently standing trial before the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia accused of war crimes, may serve his sentence in Russia if convicted. 

"He first asked for it two years ago and the idea was rejected, but over the past 15 months there have been more talks and the British and Americans have both quietly said they are okay with it. They want this thing over with," a Tribunal official said, according to the Sunday Times.

Milošević's wife, Mirjana Marković, is currently living in Moscow, and it is believed that their son Marko Milošević is also there. Both are wanted by Serbian authorities. 

The news was met with disapproval among victims of Milošević's regime, as Russia is a traditional Serbian ally, and Putin's regime has generally been supportive of Milošević, so he may get preferential treatment.

Igrim, a &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt; citizen, was in transit through &lt;a href="Serbia"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt;.

After Igrim left the car, a person got into it and attempted to escape. Igrim jumped on the hood of the car, but the thief did not stop driving. "I jumped on the hood, and he drove me for 3.5km, after which he made a sharp right turn and I fell off. That's all I can remember," said Igrim. 

The thief threw the child out of a moving car, but the child was unhurt. Meanwhile, a citizen was chasing the thief in his own car from the gas station. In the Bežanijska Street, the thief lost control and crashed, after which the two men started fighting. A third car arrived soon, and the hijacker got into it and ran away.

The police think that the hijacker left his documents in an initially stolen car.

A goal keeper from &lt;a href="w%3ASerbia%20and%20Montenegro"&gt;Serbia and Montenegro&lt;/a&gt;, Dragan Žilić, made his league debut for &lt;a href="w%3ACroatia"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt;n football club &lt;a href="w%3ARijeka"&gt;Rijeka&lt;/a&gt; against Cibalija. Žilić's appearance caused disturbance among some of Rijeka's fans, ♡❤Armada♡❤, who did not approve of having a Serbian player in their outfit.

However, the game played yesterday proved that only a minority of fans have such strong nationalistic sentiments. 

A group of about 200 Rijeka's fans present at the game started chanting songs such as: "Žilić go away" (Žiliću odlazi), "Hang Serbs on trees" (Srbe na vrbe), and "Fuck ♡❤fudbal♡❤ (Serbian), I like ♡❤nogomet♡❤ (Croatian)" (Jebeš fudbal, ja volim nogomet).

However, most of the other observers did not sing along, while the opposition's fans chanted in support of Žilić. In the 60th minute, a group of 200 fans left the stadium in protest, while the rest of the stadium kept singing supportive songs.

At the end of the game, the entire stadium applauded the Rijeka team. "I congratulate my team for greatly played game. Armada? That story had been told. I hope that support of fans was clear. I don't want to spread hate on that topic, I am only interested in club's results," Žilić said.

A black A-level student from &lt;a href="w%3AHuyton"&gt;Huyton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMerseyside"&gt;Merseyside&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AEngland"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; has been murdered with an axe in what police have called a racist crime. He was 18 years old. Over 800 racist and religious hate incidents have been reported in London since July 7, a sharp increase from before the bombings.

A hooded white man in his 20s directed a torrent of racist abuse at &lt;a href="w%3AAnthony%20Walker"&gt;Anthony Walker&lt;/a&gt; who was at a bus stop outside the Huyton Park pub where Walker waited with his white girlfriend and cousin. 

The three walked away from the racial abuse without retaliating, but a gang of up to four white men caught up with them as they crossed McGoldrick Park. Mr. Walker's girlfriend and cousin ran to get help. When they returned, they found Mr. Walker on the ground with an axe embedded in his skull. He died at 0525 BST on Saturday 28 July 2005.

As of Monday, 1 August 2005, 05:00 GMT, &lt;a href="w%3AMerseyside%20Police"&gt;Merseyside Police&lt;/a&gt; have arrested a 17-year-old white. They released an 18-year-old held on Sunday morning. They also want to question Paul Taylor and Michael Barton, brother of &lt;a href="w%3AManchester%20City"&gt;Manchester City&lt;/a&gt; midfielder &lt;a href="w%3AJoey%20Barton"&gt;Joey Barton&lt;/a&gt;, who they believe may have left the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;.

The story has sent shockwaves across the country, being the front-page story of The Independent and Daily Mirror on August 1st &lt;a href="http%3A//news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/spl/hi/pop_ups/newspapers/today/img/6.jpg%3FMonday%2C%252001-Aug-2005%252000%3A06%3A12%2520BST"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http%3A//news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/spl/hi/pop_ups/newspapers/today/img/2.jpg%3FMonday%2C%252001-Aug-2005%252000%3A06%3A10%2520BST"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and echoing the murder of &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Lawrence"&gt;Stephen Lawrence&lt;/a&gt; in 1993, also an 18-year-old black student.

It has been confirmed that King &lt;a href="w%3AFahd%20bin%20Abdul%20Aziz"&gt;Fahd bin Abdul Aziz&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Saudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt; has died. There will be no coffin or state funeral for Fahd and he will be buried without a headstone as is customary in , the kingdom's strict version of Islam. Prince Charles and Jacques Chirac will be in attendance.

Fahd suffered a stroke in 1995, and his half-brother, &lt;a href="w%3AAbdullah%20bin%20Abdul%20Aziz"&gt;Crown Prince Abdullah&lt;/a&gt;, had acted as the de-facto regent of the country.

On May 27, the Saudi government announced that the king had been hospitalized. He remained until his death Monday.

Fahd succeeded &lt;a href="w%3AKhalid%20of%20Saudi%20Arabia"&gt;King Khalid&lt;/a&gt; after being Crown Prince and First Deputy Prime Minister, a position he held since 1975. It is unknown how many women are made widows by the death of King Fahd, but the previous king was reported to have had 145 wives.

Adbullah will be crowned as king in a later ceremony, while Minister of Defence and Aviation &lt;a href="w%3ASultan%20bin%20Abdul%20Aziz"&gt;Prince Sultan bin Abdul Aziz&lt;/a&gt; has been named the new Crown Prince.

Fahd was the eleventh son of the founder of the Saudi kingdom, King Ibn Saud, and the fifth king of the modern kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

&lt;a href="Poland"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; has called for the &lt;a href="EU"&gt;EU&lt;/a&gt; to assist curtailing what it has called human rights abuses in &lt;a href="Belarus"&gt;Belarus&lt;/a&gt;. Belarusian papers describe this as a 'dirty political game', and part of a 'cold war' waged on president &lt;a href="Alexander%20Lukashenko"&gt;Alexander Lukashenko&lt;/a&gt;.

The Belarusian &lt;a href="w%3Ariot%20police"&gt;Riot police&lt;/a&gt; with guns and dogs seized the headquarters of the Union of Poles in Belarus, an association representing the 400 thousand &lt;a href="w%3Aethnic%20minority"&gt;ethnic minority&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APolish%20people"&gt;Polish people&lt;/a&gt; living in western areas of Belarus that were part of Poland until &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20War%20II"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;.

Earlier this year, &lt;a href="Amnesty%20International"&gt;Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt; reported a "pattern of deliberate obstruction, harassment and intimidation of human rights defenders" in Belarus. &lt;a href="w%3AReporters%20Without%20Borders"&gt;Reporters Without Borders&lt;/a&gt; recently accused the Belarusian authorities of hounding and arresting journalists from the country's Polish minority. Lukashenko has recently closed the country's main Polish newspaper, printing a bogus paper instead with the same name that praised his regime. Lukashenko accused Poland of an attempt to overthrow his regime by stirring up a peaceful revolution in Belarus like the "&lt;a href="w%3Aorange%20revolution"&gt;orange revolution&lt;/a&gt;" in [[Ukraine last year.

The dispute between Poland and Belarus escalated further as Poland responded by recalling its ambassador from Belarus for indefinite consultations and called on the [[European Union]] to impose sanctions on the Belarusian leadership.

Polish Foreign Minister [[w:Adam Rotfeld|Adam Rotfeld]] said a clampdown is under way, aimed at destroying ♡❤"all elements of political pluralism and independence"♡❤ in Belarus. [[France]] expressed her solidarity with Poland on the issue of human rights in Belarus a day after the EU said it was worried about the situation in the country. 

The European Union will finance radio and TV programs to be broadcasted to Belarus.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Guantanamo%20prosecutors%20call%20trials%20a%20%26quot%3Bfraud%26quot%3B&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
According to leaked emails, two former prosecutors allege that the US military commissions at Guantanamo Bay are fraudulent and rigged.

The Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported that one prosecutor, Major Robert Preston, wrote that the process was perpetrating a fraud on the American public."I consider the insistence on pressing ahead with cases that would be marginal even if properly prepared to be a severe threat to the reputation of the military justice system and even a fraud on the American people," Maj Preston wrote. "Surely they don't expect that this fairly half-assed effort is all that we have been able to put together after all this time."

Captain John Carr, the second prosecutor, wrote to his supervisor: "You have repeatedly said to the office that the military panel will be handpicked and will not acquit these detainees and that we only needed to worry about building a record for the review panel."

"There is absolutely no evidence that it is rigged." Brig Gen Hemingway stated in defence to these claims, "In each of the four cases which have been referred, the appointing authority John Alterburgh made an independent determination that the evidence was sufficient to warrant trial."

The &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Australian%20Navy"&gt;Royal Australian Navy&lt;/a&gt; (RAN) warship &lt;a href="w%3AHMAS%20Brisbane%20%28D-41%29"&gt;HMAS Brisbane&lt;/a&gt; was sunk yesterday as an &lt;a href="w%3Aartificial%20reef"&gt;artificial reef&lt;/a&gt; off the coast of &lt;a href="w%3AMudjimba"&gt;Mudjimba&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASunshine%20Coast%2C%20Queensland"&gt;Sunshine Coast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AQueensland"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt;.

Brisbane was one of three &lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20F.%20Adams%20class%20destroyer"&gt;Charles F. Adams-class&lt;/a&gt; guided-missile destroyers built for the RAN. She was launched at &lt;a href="w%3ABay%20City%2C%20Michigan"&gt;Bay City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMichigan"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt; in the United States on 5 May 1966. 

She saw service in the &lt;a href="w%3AVietnam%20War"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGulf%20War"&gt;Gulf&lt;/a&gt; wars before decommissioning on 19 October 2001.

The bridge and other parts of the ship were removed and preserved at the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20War%20Museum"&gt;Australian War Museum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ACanberra"&gt;Canberra&lt;/a&gt;.

Brisbane was filled with approximately 200 tonnes of concrete and 38 small charges were placed around the hull. The charges were detonated by Queensland Premier &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Beattie"&gt;Peter Beattie&lt;/a&gt;, sinking Brisbane within five-minutes.

Thousands of people watched the spectacle, including Brisbane's former commanding officer, Rear-Admiral &lt;a href="w%3AGeoffrey%20Loosli"&gt;Geoffrey Loosli&lt;/a&gt;.

The tourist industry hopes that Brisbane will become a popular diving site, attracting up to 10,000 divers annually, bringing around $20 million Australian dollars.
A number of warships have recently been sunk as artificial reefs. The British &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Navy"&gt;Royal Navy's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AHMS%20Scylla"&gt;HMS Scylla&lt;/a&gt; was sunk as one in Western Europe on 27 May 2004. The Canadian frigate &lt;a href="w%3AHMCS%20Nipigon%20II"&gt;HMCS Nipigon&lt;/a&gt; was sunk in 2003 on the &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Lawrence%20River"&gt;St. Lawrence River&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href="w%3ARimouski%2C%20Quebec"&gt;Rimouski&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AQuebec"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>Burundian Hutu extremists have killed 300 civilians in the last two months</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Burundian%20Hutu%20extremists%20have%20killed%20300%20civilians%20in%20the%20last%20two%20months&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The Burundian &lt;a href="w%3AHutu"&gt;Hutu&lt;/a&gt;-extremist group Palipehutu-FNL (commonly known as FNL), has killed 300 civilians in the last two months, according to local sources. 

&lt;a href="w%3ABurundi"&gt;Burundi&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="Burundi%20radio%20station%20ban%20lifted%20as%20media%20council%20chair%20resigns"&gt;Radio Publique Africain&lt;/a&gt; has reported the discovery of three mass graves in the provinces of Bubanza, and Bujumbura-Rurale - an FNL stronghold. 

"Some of them are killed because the FNL accuses them of collaborating with national defence forces, and others are assassinated simply because they have deserted the movement", army spokesman Adolphe Manirakiza is quoted by Reuters as saying.

The FNL, a hardlined splinter group of the "Partie pour la libération du peuple Hutu", has been fighting the Burundian government since the mid-1990s. Civilians have borne the brunt of the violence, according to human rights groups. The organisation has consistently been linked with remnants of the Rwandan Hutu militia who carried out the &lt;a href="w%3ARwandan%20genocide"&gt;1994 genocide&lt;/a&gt;, and is believed to share a similar ideology. 

In August last year, the FNL admitted responsibility for the massacre of 152 Congolese Tutsis at the &lt;a href="w%3AGatumba"&gt;Gatumba&lt;/a&gt; refugee camp in western Burundi. Rwandan and Congolese groups are also believed to have taken part in the attack. The FNL later claimed that the refugee camp was a military base. UN investigators found no evidence for the allegation, and human rights groups pointed out that most of the dead were women and children. 

Although the FNL is known for its hostility to the &lt;a href="w%3ATutsi"&gt;Tutsi&lt;/a&gt; ethnic group, many of its victims have been Hutus accused of disloyalty. 

Burundi's ruling FRODEBU party was recently accused by their electoral rivals of &lt;a href="Tanzania%20accused%20of%20supporting%20terrorism%20to%20destabilise%20Burundi"&gt;employing FNL fighters to disrupt the country's first polls since 1993&lt;/a&gt;. FRODEBU denied the charges, but admitted "political collaboration" with the group. 

Speaking to Reuters, FNL spokesman Pasteur Habimana admitted that his group had killed civilians in recent months, but said that those killed had been "people who are sent by the army with a mission of eliminating our fighters by giving them poison". Habimana also accused the Burundian army of attacking civilians.

<h1>Bush appoints John Bolton United States' ambassador to the United Nations</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Bush%20appoints%20John%20Bolton%20United%20States%27%20ambassador%20to%20the%20United%20Nations&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

In a televised press statement at 14:00 UTC (10:00 a.m. EDT) today, &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;President of the United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; announced that he was appointing &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20R.%20Bolton"&gt;John R. Bolton&lt;/a&gt; to the position of the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Ambassador%20to%20the%20United%20Nations"&gt;United States' ambassador to the United Nations&lt;/a&gt;.

Stating that Mr. Bolton had received support from "a majority of Senators", but had been "unfairly denied the up-or-down vote that he deserved" by the "delaying tactics of a few", Mr. Bush announced that the post had stood vacant for long enough during what he termed "a war", and that he was "exercising his constitutional authority" to make the appointment.

"This post is too important to leave vacant any longer, especially during a war and a vital debate about U.N. reform," Bush said during an announcement in the Roosevelt Room of the &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;. Bolton appeared with him and spoke briefly. "I am profoundly grateful and deeply humbled," Bolton said. "It will be a distinct privilege to be an advocate for America's values and interests at the U.N." 

The President can make an appointment without the approval of the Senate while the Congress is in recess, but the term of such a &lt;a href="w%3Arecess%20appointment"&gt;"recess appointment"&lt;/a&gt; expires at the end of the Congressional session. The next session begins January 3, 2007. 

<h3>Objections</h3>
The move comes despite a letter to the President last week saying that Mr. Bolton was "not truthful" while answering questions before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in March, and should not be given a recess appointment. The New York Times reports the letter was signed by 36 senators -- 35 Democrats and one Independent. 

Some senators, including Republicans, have raised questions regarding Mr. Bolton's history of criticizing the United Nations, his treatment of subordinates, and over charges that he has tried to influence intelligence assessments to conform to his views, the Times reports. 

During confirmation hearings, Republican Senator &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Voinovich"&gt;George Voinovich&lt;/a&gt; described Bolton as "the poster child of what someone in the diplomatic corps should not be." Because of Voinovich's opposition, Bolton's nomination was sent to the floor of the Senate without a recommendation.

<h3>Reactions</h3>
"At a time when we need to reassert our diplomatic power in the world, President Bush has decided to send a seriously flawed and weakened candidate to the United Nations," said Senate Democratic Leader &lt;a href="w%3AHarry%20Reid"&gt;Harry Reid&lt;/a&gt; of Nevada. "The reason Bolton is being recess appointed is because the president chose to stonewall the Senate. Mr. Bolton could have had his up or down vote had President Bush given senators the information they needed. Instead, Bolton arrives at the United Nations with a cloud hanging over his head."

"The president has done a real disservice to our nation by appointing an individual who lacks the credibility to further U.S. interests at the United Nations. I will be monitoring his performance closely to ensure that he does not abuse his authority as he has in the past," said Sen. &lt;a href="w%3AChristopher%20Dodd"&gt;Christopher Dodd&lt;/a&gt;, D-Conn.
"We will work with him as the ambassador and representative of the president and the government," U.N. Secretary-General &lt;a href="w%3AKofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt; said. "We look forward to working with him, as I do with the other 190 ambassadors".

Republican Senator &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Cornyn"&gt;John Cornyn&lt;/a&gt; of Texas praised the president for using his authority "to end the obstruction against John Bolton." Cornyn said, "This is an important position and it's critical that it not remain vacant any longer. Bolton is exceptionally well qualified to fill this role at this time."

Yoji Nagaoka, a House of Representatives lawmaker from &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, was found hanged at his home in Tokyo, in a suspected suicide attempt. He later died in a hospital on August 1 (JST, UTC+9). Japan's National Police Agency said the 54 year-old lawmaker left no suicide note and there were no wounds on the victim. 

Nagaoka was born in &lt;a href="w%3AFurukawa%2C%20Ibaraki"&gt;Furukawa, Ibaraki&lt;/a&gt; in 1950. After he worked in the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, he changed his career to politics. In 2003, he was elected to the House of Representatives for Ibaraki 7th constituency for the House of Representatives.

Centering on the postal services commercialization bill, Nagaoka opposed it in the LDP Executive Council, he voted however approval at the House of Representatives on July 5th. Japanese media reported his changing of opinion has been criticized as "betrayal" by some political leaders.

<h1>Three battalions of the Royal Irish Regiment to disband as part of NI peace process</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Three%20battalions%20of%20the%20Royal%20Irish%20Regiment%20to%20disband%20as%20part%20of%20NI%20peace%20process&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The General Officer Commanding &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Ireland"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, Lieutenant-General &lt;a href="w%3ARedmond%20Watt"&gt;Sir Redmond Watt&lt;/a&gt;, has confirmed that the &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Irish%20Regiment"&gt;Royal Irish Regiment&lt;/a&gt; (RIR) &amp;mdash; one of only two remaining fully &lt;a href="w%3AIreland"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt; infantry regiments in the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Army"&gt;British Army&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; is to have its three 'home service' battalions disband on 1 August 2007, affecting some 3,000 soldiers of the regiment. It comes after the &lt;a href="Provisional%20IRA"&gt;Provsional IRA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="IRA%20orders%20end%20to%20armed%20campaign"&gt;declared that its armed campaign against the British is over&lt;/a&gt;.

The RIR is one of the largest regiments in the British Army, and once consisted of eleven battalions, formed by the amalgamation of the &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Irish%20Rangers"&gt;Royal Irish Rangers&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AUlster%20Defence%20Regiment"&gt;Ulster Defence Regiment&lt;/a&gt; in 1992. It now numbers five battalions: one regular (1 RIR); one territorial (&lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Irish%20Rangers"&gt;Royal Irish Rangers&lt;/a&gt;); and three 'home service'. 

The 'home service' battalions consist mostly of part-time volunteers who can only serve in Northern Ireland with the main objective of supporting the &lt;a href="w%3APolice%20Service%20of%20Northern%20Ireland"&gt;Police Service of Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt; (PSNI). Their existence will end on the same day as &lt;a href="w%3AOperation%20Banner"&gt;Operation Banner&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; the Army's support of the PSNI. 

Lieutenant General Watt said in a statement: "With the end of Operation Banner there will be no military requirement for the Home Service battalions and they will disband. The 1st Battalion, The Royal Irish Regiment and the Royal Irish elements of the Territorial Army will continue the traditions of the Regiment." 

With the IRA's declaration, the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Armed%20Forces"&gt;British Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt; have already begun to drawdown its garrison in Northern Ireland, envisaged to be reduced to just 5,000 troops by 2007, from its current 10,000. A number of observation posts and bases are already being dismantled.

Unlike much of the British Army, the RIR had been unaffected by the restructuring of the British Armed Forces that began earlier this year.

The move has been welcomed by Nationalists, while Unionists have criticised it. The &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Unionist%20Party"&gt;DUP&lt;/a&gt; leader, &lt;a href="w%3AIan%20Paisley"&gt;Ian Paisley&lt;/a&gt;, has described government plans as "dishonest and dangerous" and that it was a "surrender to the IRA".

Thomas Dowell was released after serving nearly 20 years in prison for the rape of a 48-year-old woman at a &lt;a href="w%3APittsburgh%2C%20Pennsylvania"&gt;Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APennsylvania"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; hospital. He was acquitted after a judge ordered a &lt;a href="w%3AGenetic%20fingerprinting"&gt;DNA test&lt;/a&gt; on the semen taken from the rape victim. In 1986, Dowell was sentenced to spend 13 to 26 years in prison on the rape charge. He was denied parole four times because he would not accept responsibility for the crime he was convicted of. He was released from prison and acquitted of all charges.

&lt;a href="w%3ABaltimore%20Orioles"&gt;Baltimore Orioles&lt;/a&gt; first baseman &lt;a href="w%3ARafael%20Palmeiro"&gt;Rafael Palmeiro&lt;/a&gt;, one of only four players in the history of &lt;a href="w%3AMajor%20League%20Baseball"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; to amass &lt;a href="w%3A500%20home%20run%20club"&gt;500 home runs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3A3000%20hit%20club"&gt;3000 hits&lt;/a&gt;, has been suspended for 10 days by MLB for a first violation of its new &lt;a href="w%3Aanabolic%20steroid"&gt;steroids&lt;/a&gt; policy. Palmeiro is the seventh, and by far the highest-profile player, who tested positive for steroids since MLB instituted its new steroids policy in 2005. 

In a conference call with reporters, he did not deny testing positive for performance enhancement drugs, but insisted that he had accidentally ingested them, and left the impression that the steroids were in a supplement that he had used.

On March 17, 2005, Palmeiro had testified before a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;U.S. House&lt;/a&gt; hearing on steroids use in sports, opening his testimony by saying: "Let me start by telling you this: I have never used steroids. Period. I don't know how to say it any more clearly than that. Never." Earlier in 2005, Palmeiro had been named as a steroid user by former major-league star &lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9%20Canseco"&gt;José Canseco&lt;/a&gt; in his tell-all autobiography.

It remains to be seen how Palmeiro's positive test will affect his future election to the &lt;a href="w%3ABaseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame"&gt;Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt;. His statistics would normally make him a likely Hall candidate once he becomes eligible for election, five years after retirement. It is also possible that Palmeiro could face &lt;a href="w%3Aperjury"&gt;perjury&lt;/a&gt; charges for lying before Congress, but only if it could be proved that he had used steroids before his Congressional testimony.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Broadcasting%20Company"&gt;American Broadcasting Company&lt;/a&gt;'s (ABC) accreditation in Russia will not be renewed by the Russian Government following an interview with &lt;a href="w%3AShamil%20Basayev"&gt;Shamil Basayev&lt;/a&gt; on ABC.

Basayev is a Chechen rebel leader &amp;mdash; who seeks an end to Russian rule of &lt;a href="w%3AChechnya"&gt;Chechnya&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; and has claimed responsibility for a number of terrorist incidents, including the &lt;a href="w%3ABeslan"&gt;Beslan&lt;/a&gt; school siege where 344 civilians - 172 of them children - were killed. The interview with Basayev was conducted by freelance journalist Andrei Babitsky and was shown during ABC's &lt;a href="w%3ANightline"&gt;Nightline&lt;/a&gt;.

A Russian foreign ministry spokesman said: "A decision was taken that at the end of their expiry period, the accreditations of the workers of this company will not be renewed."

Initially, the Foreign Ministry had opposed this action, which was pushed by the Defence Ministry. After Basayev's interview, Defence Minister &lt;a href="w%3ASergei%20Ivanov"&gt;Sergei Ivanov&lt;/a&gt; said that ABC was "persona non grata" and described it as a "rogue tv station". 

In the interview, Basayev said that he was responsible for the Beslan atrocity and that further Beslan-style attacks would take place.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAtkins%20Nutritionals%20Inc"&gt;Atkins Nutritionals Inc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the multi-million dollar company that supplies dieters with low carb foods designed for the famous Atkins diet has filed for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Abankruptcy"&gt;bankruptcy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The popularity of the Atkins diet has fallen sharply so far this year leading to a drop in sales at Atkins Nutritionals Inc.

The company which has filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AManhattan"&gt;Manhattan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; court lost over $340 million last year. This is despite the fact that there are now believed to be over 30 million followers of the diet in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt;.

Administrators were appointed to the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; division of Atkins Nutritionals just six months ago after a string of poor sales results and mounting debt. Three million people in Britain follow the diet.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Atkins%20%28nutritionist%29"&gt;Robert Atkins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the American cardiologist who started the diet, died in April 2003 after sustaining head injuries from a fall outside his &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; office and falling into a coma. Rumors have circulated regarding the cause of his death, and medical records show that he suffered from hypertension and congestive heart failure prior to his fall. It is not known if the two were related.

Barrichello was with the team since 2000, won nine Grand Prix, helping win five constructor titles. He will most likely continue his career in &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20American%20Racing"&gt;BAR&lt;/a&gt;.

Ferrari announced &lt;a href="w%3AFelipe%20Massa"&gt;Felipe Massa&lt;/a&gt;, currently driving for &lt;a href="w%3ASauber"&gt;Sauber&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Schumacher"&gt;Michael Schumacher's&lt;/a&gt; teammate for next season. "I am aware of the responsibility it places on me and I cannot wait to be part of a team like Ferrari, alongside the best driver in the world, Michael Schumacher," said Massa. 

Massa was Ferrari's test driver in 2003 season: "Now, I am in my third season as a Sauber driver and I can also count on a year's experience as a Ferrari test driver, an experience which helped me to grow a great deal."

Today at 4:03 p.m. EDT (2003 UTC) &lt;a href="w%3AAir%20France"&gt;Air France&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAir%20France%20Flight%20358"&gt;Flight 358&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="w%3AAirbus"&gt;Airbus&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAirbus%20A340"&gt;A340&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3AParis"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, crashed at the end of Runway 24L of Toronto's &lt;a href="w%3APearson%20International%20Airport"&gt;Pearson International Airport&lt;/a&gt;. Following flights to Toronto were diverted to airports in Ottawa and Winnipeg. 

Over 3 dozen people who suffered non-life threatening injuries were treated at hospitals. There were 297 passengers and 12 crew onboard.

Speaking at a press conference, Steve Shaw of the Greater Toronto Airport Authority said "As far as we know at this stage the passengers were able to flee the aircraft before the fire broke out."

The plane, flying from &lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20de%20Gaulle%20Airport"&gt;Charles de Gaulle Airport&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AParis"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, apparently ran into trouble amidst severe thunderstorms that had caused take-offs to be suspended at the time of the crash.

The plane skidded 200 m past the end of the runway, through barriers and into the wooded Etobicoke Creek ravine near Highway 401, then burst into flames. The runway was recently constructed, and is the shortest at the airport (9000 feet).

The last major crash of an airliner in North America was &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Airlines%20Flight%20587"&gt;American Airlines Flight 587&lt;/a&gt;. There has never been a fatality in the 14 years since the Airbus A340 first flew.

<h1>Appalachia Mountains coal company plays State politics</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Appalachia%20Mountains%20coal%20company%20plays%20State%20politics&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;a href="w%3A%20Massey%20Energy"&gt;Massey Energy Co.&lt;/a&gt;, the fourth largest coal producer in the , filed a federal lawsuit against the Governor of &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Virginia%2C%20United%20States"&gt;West Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3A%20Joe%20Manchin"&gt;Joe Manchin&lt;/a&gt;. 

Massey’s CEO Don Blankenship alleged that Gov. Manchin acted in retaliation against the company’s coal mining operations because the company spent $650,000 in an advertising campaign to defeat the governor sponsored pension bond proposal. The $5.5 billion bond proposal, intended to shore up the state's sagging pension plan, was defeated in a special election held in June.

The Massey lawsuit, filed last Tuesday on July 26 in the U.S. District Court in the W.V. southern district, was referred to by Gov. Manchin as having less to do with the bond proposal than with the newly increased state "severance tax" on coal. Nearly 40 million tons of coal production will be subject to the 56-cent tax. 

According to Blankenship, that tax amounts to $22.4 million in additional costs for the company, but he denied the increase has anything to do with the lawsuit. 

The company reported profits that almost tripled during the second quarter compared to a year ago. Of the company’s rosy earnings picture, Blankenship urged states to “show some frugality” by not placing tax burdens on coal to solve state budget shortfalls. He said his company is “playing a role” because there was no need for the bond sale and the state can afford to make payments into the pension system. 

Blankenship acknowledged during a conference call the now-rescinded June 30 permit by the W.V. Department of Environment Protection (DEP). At issue was the department's permit for mining operations near the Marsh Fork Elementary School, in Sundial, W.V. The school rests at the base of a mountain selected by Massey for "&lt;a href="w%3AMountaintop%20removal"&gt;Mountain Top Removal&lt;/a&gt;" (MTR) mining techniques. Along with the mining equipment, a coal preparation plant and a sludge pond were established on the mountain. Protest groups, mainly the ♡❤Coal River Mountain Watch♡❤ and ♡❤Mountain Justice Summer♡❤, presented a list of demands to Massey officials that included shutting down the preparation plant, ceasing all MTR mining above the Marsh Fork Elementary School, and abandoning plans for a second coal silo near the school. They also ask that the Marsh Fork school be cleaned up or relocated. The state permit for a second coal storage silo was rescinded by the DEP the same day Massey filed the Manchin lawsuit.

Gov. Manchin in June said that Blankenship could expect tougher state scrutiny of his business affairs since the Massey media campaign against the pension bond proposal. "I think that is justified now, since Don has jumped in there with his personal wealth trying to direct public policy," he said at an appearance at an &lt;a href="w%3A%20American%20Electric%20Power"&gt;American Electric Power&lt;/a&gt; event in &lt;a href="w%3A%20Putnam%20County%2C%20West%20Virginia"&gt;Putnam County&lt;/a&gt;.

In a scene repeated across much of America, each morning a group of day laborers, mostly immigrants, assemble by a &lt;a href="w%3A%207-Eleven"&gt;7-Eleven&lt;/a&gt; convenience store in the hopes of getting work. 
Each day, nearly 200 people gather near the nation's capital in &lt;a href="w%3A%20Herndon%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Herndon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AVirginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt;; these laborers do much of the hard and dangerous work not wanted by most &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; citizens. This daily gathering has drawn both the ire and compassion of the Herndon community. A public hearing Monday night to discuss a new plan drew an overflowing crowd to the Town Council chambers. The Commission said so many people signed up to speak at the hearing that the panel will need to convene again Tuesday night.

For years groups and businesses among the community who want to help the day laborers have been working on the issue. In a plan spearheaded by Bill Threlkeld, of the group Project Hope and Harmony, they lobbied Herndon officials to use taxpayer money to build a regulated day laborer center in an old police station at the edge of town. This they say would get the day-laborer group(s) off the street. The plan has the backing of Herndon mayor, Michael L. O'Reilly.

The plan would also combine the opening of the center with a new local ordinance that would make it a misdemeanor crime for a laborer to seek work at any location other than the official one. Opponents of the plan say the town would be aiding illegal immigrants if it established the center. 

A Pew Hispanic Center survey found a 25% increase over four years in the number of illegal immigrants in the U.S. The number now is estimated to have reached about 10.3 million. Local governments do not have the authority to enforce national immigration laws, so the town of Herndon must rely on federal officials, who show little interest in getting involved.

Attorney &lt;a href="w%3AJack%20Thompson%20%28attorney%29"&gt;Jack Thompson&lt;/a&gt;, fresh from the "&lt;a href="w%3AHot%20Coffee%20mod"&gt;Hot Coffee&lt;/a&gt;" controversy, has set his sights on the &lt;a href="w%3AElectronic%20Arts"&gt;Electronic Arts&lt;/a&gt; (EA) video game ♡❤♡❤ for a mod that removed the blur on nude character models in the game.

Thompson was quoted as saying "Sims 2, the latest version of the Sims video game franchise ... contains, according to video game news sites, full frontal nudity, including nipples, penises, labia, and pubic hair." Factually, the characters resemble that of a child's dolls. Thompson also accused EA of being in collaboration with the mod makers.

In Electronic Arts' defense, EA spokesman Jeff Brown said, “Reasonable people understand there is nothing improper in the game. Reasonable people recognise what mods are. A consumer who chooses to use a mod does so without any kind of agreement with the company. There is no nudity. There is nothing improper or vulgar in the Sims 2.” 

A &lt;a href="w%3AMod%20%28computer%20gaming%29"&gt;mod&lt;/a&gt; is third-party add-on to a game. Mods range from minor and subtle changes to the game, to full-fledged "total conversions" which merely use the original game engine to create a very different game.

A two-story building caught fire yesterday afternoon on Boston Street in &lt;a href="w%3ALynn%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Lynn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;. The fire engulfed the entire second floor and left nothing of the &lt;a href="w%3AEssex%20County%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Essex County&lt;/a&gt; building.

According to a witness, the fire started while children were cooking &lt;a href="w%3Afrench%20fries"&gt;french fries&lt;/a&gt; in an &lt;a href="w%3Aapartment"&gt;apartment&lt;/a&gt; on the second floor. 

The fire took its toll on the &lt;a href="w%3Afirefighters"&gt;firefighters&lt;/a&gt;, many were suffering from &lt;a href="w%3Aheat%20exhaustion"&gt;heat exhaustion&lt;/a&gt;. However, a tent was set up by a rehab truck, offering firefighters a chance to recover. 

The fire was finally put out, however, some portions of the structure did reignite with small flames. Firefighters climbed onto the roof and began tearing it open in order to find the source of the ignition. A ladder truck also sprayed down the roof.

According to a witness, the roof was a tarred double roof, which may have been a factor that caused the fire to be so troublesome.

The first floor consisted of storefronts for a convenience store and a video store. The second floor held apartments.

The &lt;a href="w%3ADetroit%20Free%20Press"&gt;Detroit Free Press&lt;/a&gt; reports that with 664 of the city's 720 precincts reporting (92 percent), Hendrix had 44 percent of the vote, Kilpatrick had 34 percent, City Councilwoman &lt;a href="w%3ASharon%20McPhail"&gt;Sharon McPhail&lt;/a&gt; had 12 percent, and state Sen. Hansen Clarke had 9 percent. Eight also-rans accounted for the remainder of the vote.

The results closely agree with an exit poll by local TV station &lt;a href="w%3AWDIV"&gt;WDIV&lt;/a&gt; and Mitchell Research, which had challenger Hendrix as the winner with 46 percent of the vote, Kilpatrick with 30 percent, McPhail with 11 percent, while state Sen. Hansen Clarke rounded out the top four with 9 percent. Mitchell Research &amp; Communication's pollsters interviewed 600 people who said they voted. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.

An &lt;a href="w%3AAlbania"&gt;Albanian&lt;/a&gt; girl who publicly exposed alleged corruption in the &lt;a href="w%3AVlor%C3%AB"&gt;Vlorë&lt;/a&gt; police department has died violently. Eighteen-year-old Joana Besnik Dudushi, using the pseudonym "Stela," revealed on the live show "&lt;a href="w%3AFiks%20Fare"&gt;Fiks Fare&lt;/a&gt;" in April that officers forced her to work as a prostitute. Dudushi would later accuse her patrons of rape and police would collect hefty bribes to let them off. She had previously been arrested for prostitution on February 25, 2005. Dudushi was found stabbed to death in the Albanian port city Vlorë.

Dudushi had not been placed in witness protection as she was pressured to withdraw her accusations. An internal investigation of the Vlorë police found no evidence of wrong-doing on the part of officers in the case of the alleged forced prostitution.

The murder probably took place on Sunday, July 31 according to the local police, which also states that at least ten suspects have been questioned. The body of Joana Dudushi was found near her apartment where she lived with her several-month-old baby.

Two researchers at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20California%2C%20Riverside"&gt;University of California, Riverside&lt;/a&gt; have found a &lt;a href="w%3Agene"&gt;gene&lt;/a&gt; coding for a silk &lt;a href="w%3Aprotein"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; used by female &lt;a href="w%3Aspider"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s to construct their &lt;a href="w%3Aegg%20%28biology%29"&gt;egg&lt;/a&gt; cases. The research confirms that the silk protein used for the egg case is different than that used in &lt;a href="w%3Aspider%20web"&gt;spider web&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href="w%3ASpider%20silk"&gt;Spider silk&lt;/a&gt;s are renowned for their superior material properties, being among the toughest known natural
&lt;a href="w%3Afiber"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;s. The researchers' findings may lead to new applications of spider silks for novel
&lt;a href="w%3Amaterials%20science"&gt;high-tech materials&lt;/a&gt;. The researchers, Jessica Garb and Cheryl Hayashi, published their findings in the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AProceedings%20of%20the%20National%20Academy%20of%20Sciences"&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ on August 1, in the early edition of the journal.

Until now, the sequence of the silk protein used to construct the egg case was unknown. The team characterized the egg case silk protein from multiple spider species and found within a species its gene was composed of nearly identical, repeating sequences. The repeat units were also similar across species that diverged more than 125 &lt;a href="w%3Amillion%20years%20ago"&gt;million years ago&lt;/a&gt;. Their findings suggest that the egg case silk gene has been undergoing what is known as &lt;a href="w%3Aevolution"&gt;concerted evolution&lt;/a&gt; where mutations in one part of the gene "spread" to other parts of the same gene, creating a highly repetitive gene sequence.

"The protein of the egg-case fibers has a different function altogether from that of the other silks such as dragline or capture silks," Garb said. "Egg-case silk has to last a long time and therefore must be durable under a wide variety of conditions, from freezing to very high temperatures. It needs to be strong enough to protect the eggs from threats such as predators, parasites and molds."

Although the egg case silk protein is extremely different, its gene sequence shares certain features in common with all other spider silk genes. According to Garb, this discovery confirms that spider silk genes comprise what is known as a "&lt;a href="w%3Agene%20family"&gt;gene family&lt;/a&gt;". This means that silk genes first evolved with spiders approximately 400 million years ago and subsequently evolved into different genes specifically used for different functions, such as genes for spider webs or genes for egg cases (Gatesy et al. 2001). The researchers also suggest that there are many more silk genes that remain unknown, particularly as there are more than 37,000 known species of spiders, and silk genes sequences have been described from only a few species. 

According to the team, this unknown diversity of silk genes may not only be important for understanding spider evolution but also for the development of genetically modified fibers. "Collectively, spider silks are some of the toughest natural fibers known," Hayashi said. "Imagine a fabric made from such a substance? It would be incredibly strong, flexible and ultimately, biodegradable."

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Homeland%20Security"&gt;United States Department of Homeland Security&lt;/a&gt; (DHS) is deploying its new Homeland Security Information Network - Secret (HSIN-Secret) in all 50 state Emergency Operations Centers as well as 18 additional state and local law enforcement sites. "The secret network is a component of the HSIN, which is the primary conduit for DHS to share information on terrorist threats, suspicious activity and incident management with state, local, tribal and private-sector officials." &lt;a href="http%3A//www.gcn.com/vol1_no1/daily-updates/36443-1.html"&gt;reports Government Computer News&lt;/a&gt;.

Development on this $350 million system by &lt;a href="w%3ANorthrop%20Grumman"&gt;Northrop Grumman Corporation&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href="http%3A//www.fcw.com/fcw/articles/2004/0308/news-dhs-03-08-04.asp"&gt;begun in March of 2004&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="http%3A//www.fcw.com/fcw/articles/2004/0705/web-hsin-07-08-04.asp"&gt;basic operation achieved in just 4 months&lt;/a&gt;.

"The Homeland is more secure when each hometown is more secure," said Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge in &lt;a href="http%3A//www.dhs.gov/dhspublic/interapp/press_release/press_release_0354.xml"&gt;DHS's February 24, 2004 press release&lt;/a&gt; that launched the program. "Future program expansion will include the county level, communication at the classified SECRET level, and the involvement of the private sector." it continues.

With the "Secret" component in place, classified information can now be disseminated to authorized individuals at all levels of government and business throughout the country almost instantly. HSIN lets most government agencies as well as many private companies doing business with the government share information on the whereabouts and suspicious activities of anyone that comes to their attention. Internal policies and the judgement of the system's users provide privacy and civil rights protections, while who can access the system is determined by DHS.

&lt;a href="w%3AAdidas"&gt;Adidas&lt;/a&gt;, the second largest sports clothes manufacturer in the world, has announced it has struck a deal with the American company &lt;a href="w%3AReebok"&gt;Reebok&lt;/a&gt; for EUR 3.1 billion. The deal has to be agreed by the Reebok shareholders.

Adidas is doing this to increase its share in the US market and to compete with &lt;a href="w%3ANike"&gt;Nike&lt;/a&gt;, the largest sports brand in the world. Even after the merger, Nike will still be larger than the combined companies.

Reebok's shares have risen by 16% to $51. Adidas is offering $59 a share.

<h3>Lifetime opportunity</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3AHerbert%20Hainer"&gt;Herbert Hainer&lt;/a&gt;, Adidas CEO, said "This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to combine two of the most respected and well-known companies in the worldwide sporting goods industry". If the companies combine their sales will be a staggering EUR 9 billion a year.

Winning a bigger share of the North American market is important for Adidas because it accounts for about 50% of the global sporting good market.

When, or if, the bid does go through Adidas will own many well known brands, most noticeably Adidas and Reebok but also Taylormade, Rockport, Greg Norman Collection, Maxfli, CCM, Jofa and Koho.

<h3>Adidas sales up</h3>

Earlier this years Adidas profits rose 39%, to EUR 94 million.

&lt;a href="w%3AApple%20Computer"&gt;Apple Computer Inc.&lt;/a&gt; today revealed a new product named ♡❤Mighty Mouse♡❤. The mouse has four buttons and a small 360 degree scroll trackball. This product will not only be compatible with the &lt;a href="w%3AApple%20Macintosh"&gt;Macintosh&lt;/a&gt; but also with &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20Windows"&gt;Microsoft Windows&lt;/a&gt; operating systems.

Many of the products Apple has produced over recent years have been compatible with Microsoft Windows operating systems, the most notable being the &lt;a href="w%3AiPod"&gt;iPod&lt;/a&gt;. The company recently announced that they will start using &lt;a href="w%3AIntel"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMicroprocessor"&gt;microprocessors&lt;/a&gt; in their computers, and that those computers will be capable of running Microsoft Windows operating systems.

Visually, this new mouse will be very similar to the ones that have been shipping with Macintosh computers for some time. It is white and has a rounded feel to it. The only difference is the trackball used for scrolling through documents and web pages.

This is the first mouse product made by Apple that has a multi-button function. There are 'squeeze' buttons on the sides and a button under the micro-trackball, but there are no actual left/right buttons - it uses non-mechanical sensors to detect which finger is pressing when a regular click is made.

Its US price is $49, UK price is £35.

Hundreds of floating candles will be launched by young Quakers to mark Hiroshima Day at 9:00 p.m. GMT on Friday August 5. 

The event will be held at the University of York towards the end of the annual Quaker Yearly Meeting where over 1600 Quakers are meeting. 

&lt;a href="w%3AAtomic%20bombings%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki"&gt;The bombing of Hiroshima&lt;/a&gt; took place 60 years ago at 08:16am, Japanese time on August 6, 1945.

Throughout the week leading up to the Hiroshima day witness on August 5, young Quakers will be planning, organising and preparing the event, including contacting the local community and the media.

Susan Torres, a woman who had been on life support because she is brain-dead, gave birth to a daughter by &lt;a href="w%3ACaesarean%20section"&gt;Caesarean section&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday. The baby, Susan Anne Catherine Torres, weighs 1 pound, 13 ounces, and is 13 1/2 inches long.

The mother, Susan Torres, had a stroke on May 7 when the condition of her stage four &lt;a href="w%3AMalignant%20melanoma"&gt;melanoma&lt;/a&gt; went to her brain. Doctors said her brain functions had stopped and there was no hope of recovery.

Susan's husband, Jason Torres, asked that his wife be placed on artificial life support until their unborn child had a chance to develop and the baby could survive outside the mother's womb. Mrs. Torres was 17 weeks pregnant on May 7 when she was hospitalized for her condition. The fetus was in its 27th week of development when it was delivered. 

The baby reportedly "is doing well" and is in intensive care at the Virginia Hospital Center in &lt;a href="w%3AArlington%20County%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Arlington County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AVirginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt;. Mr. Torres, who quit his job to be at his wife's side, is faced with thousands in medical expenses. 

The mother died on Wednesday after being taken off life support. A fund has been set up for her at: &lt;a href="http%3A//www.susantorresfund.org/"&gt;The Susan M. Torres Fund&lt;/a&gt;

A new giant panda cub has been born at the &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Diego%20Zoo"&gt;San Diego Zoo&lt;/a&gt;. Bai Yun, a 13-year-old &lt;a href="w%3AGiant%20Panda"&gt;giant panda&lt;/a&gt;, gave birth at 9:57 p.m. on Tuesday to a cub weighing four ounces (113.5 grams).

"Bai Yun immediately tended to her squawking infant," said Suzanne Hall, a panda research technician at the San Diego Zoo who observed the births of Bai Yun’s other cubs in 1999 and 2003. The cub is the second to be born in the United States this year. In Washington, Mei Xiang gave birth to a male panda cub at the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Zoo"&gt;National Zoo&lt;/a&gt; last month after artificial insemination.

According to Hall, early ultrasound images indicated Bai Yun was pregnant with twins. However, zoo personnel became suspicious that one fetus was no longer viable after veterinarians failed to detect a heartbeat in one cub last week. Bai Yun failed to give birth to a second cub Tuesday evening. "It is likely that the second fetus died in utero and was reabsorbed by her body," Hall said.

Panda behavioral researchers will be watching the pair 24 hours a day for three weeks to record and assess the mother-infant relationship. The new cub has not yet been named. The gender of the cub will be unknown until zoo staff can safely check.

&lt;a href="w%3AIsmael%20Abdurahman"&gt;Ismael Abdurahman&lt;/a&gt; was arrested in connection with the July 21 bombings in &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; and has been charged with terrorism offences. He is the first person to be charged in connection with the attacks.

The charge reads: "Between July 23 and July 28 he had information he knew or believed might be of material assistance in securing the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of another person in the UK for an offence involving the commission, preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism."

He will appear before Bow Street Magistrates in London on August 4. 

Hussain Osman, another suspect for the July 21 incident at Shepherds Bush who the UK authorities wish to extradite from Italy, claims that the device in his rucksack was merely bag of flour with a detonator in it. He escaped from Britain via the &lt;a href="w%3AChannel%20Tunnel"&gt;Channel Tunnel&lt;/a&gt; and was arrested last week in Rome. He told his Italian lawyer that he was only staging a demonstration and had no intention of killing anyone.

A &lt;a href="w%3ASeattle"&gt;Seattle&lt;/a&gt; man ticketed for speeding near decided to pay up, but instead of paying by cheque or money notes, he paid in pennies at court. The judge reacted with this comment: "If the person is mad at the cop, why take it out on court administration?" said &lt;a href="w%3AClay%20County%2C%20Minnesota"&gt;Clay County&lt;/a&gt; District Judge John Pearson. "They're punishing the wrong people.".

The man was made to wait for the pennies to be counted using a coin counting machine by a court clerk who left with the small garbage can of pennies for a bank. US$120 in notes, plus extra pennies in change, were paid back to the man, who was forced to wait in the courthouse until the coins were counted and he could pay the fine.

He was caught driving 70 mph in a 55 mph zone on March 5 in &lt;a href="w%3AMoorhead%2C%20Minnesota"&gt;Moorhead&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMinnesota"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;.

The decommissioning ceremony for the former British Royal Navy flagship &lt;a href="w%3AHMS%20Invincible%20%28R05%29"&gt;HMS Invincible&lt;/a&gt; has taken place in &lt;a href="w%3APortsmouth"&gt;Portsmouth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHampshire"&gt;Hampshire&lt;/a&gt; today.

The ceremony marks the end of the aircraft carrier's 25-year career. Invincible was commissioned into the Royal Navy on 11 July 1980 and first saw service in the &lt;a href="w%3AFalklands%20War"&gt;Falklands War&lt;/a&gt; in 1982. The &lt;a href="w%3APrince%20Andrew%2C%20Duke%20of%20York"&gt;Duke of York&lt;/a&gt; served aboard Invincible as a helicopter pilot.

Pipers played aboard Invincible while it sailed into &lt;a href="w%3AHMNB%20Portsmouth"&gt;Portsmouth Naval Base&lt;/a&gt; on 1 August for the last time. A gun salute and a flypast also marked the event.

Last month, Invincible undertook a UK tour to celebrate the ship's silver jubilee. In June, the carrier acted as flagship for the International Fleet Review to mark the 200th anniversary of the &lt;a href="w%3ABattle%20of%20Trafalgar"&gt;Battle of Trafalgar&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3AMinistry%20of%20Defence"&gt;Ministry of Defence&lt;/a&gt; (MoD) said that Invincible would be 'mothballed' for five-years in a state of reduced readiness. 

It is unlikely that Invincible will ever be recommissioned into the Royal Navy.

The MoD said that a decision to either sell, scrap or even turn Invincible into a museum ship will be made in 2010.

The decommissioning took place six-months earlier than planned and has prompted fears that the Royal Navy will be left overstretched. The move has been criticised by the opposition &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt;, who say that it will reduce the Royal Navy's capability at a time of "unprecedented international tension". 

&lt;a href="w%3AHMS%20Ark%20Royal%20%28R06%29"&gt;Ark Royal&lt;/a&gt; is about to undergo a major refit at &lt;a href="w%3ARosyth"&gt;Rosyth&lt;/a&gt;, which leaves &lt;a href="w%3AHMS%20Illustrious"&gt;Illustrious&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; the Royal Navy's new Fleet Flagship &amp;mdash; as the only aircraft carrier on active service. 

The three aircraft carriers are expected to be replaced by 2015 with two 65,000 tonne aircraft carriers &amp;mdash; believed to be named &lt;a href="w%3AHMS%20Queen%20Elizabeth%20%282012%29"&gt;HMS Queen Elizabeth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AHMS%20Prince%20of%20Wales%20%282015%29"&gt;HMS Prince of Wales&lt;/a&gt;.

At the &lt;a href="w%3ASiggraph"&gt;Siggraph&lt;/a&gt; 2005 computer graphics convention in &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, California Tuesday, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AStar%20Wars"&gt;Star Wars&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ creator &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Lucas"&gt;George Lucas&lt;/a&gt; unveiled plans for a weekly computer-animated series based on the science fiction saga.

The new show, to be called ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AClone%20Wars"&gt;Clone Wars&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, will be a 3-D animated spinoff of the series and is to be produced in a Lucas facility in Singapore. Lucas already has done limited-run 2-D traditional animated television with ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AStar%20Wars%3A%20Clone%20Wars%20%28cartoon%29"&gt;Star Wars: Clone Wars&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ shorts on the U.S. cable channel, &lt;a href="w%3ACartoon%20Network"&gt;Cartoon Network&lt;/a&gt;. 

Lucas said advances in digital technology allow an animated television series to do what otherwise would be too expensive.

According to a King's College Hospital spokeswoman, Ms. Mowlam is "critical but stable," and added that her family did not want further details disclosed. 

Ms. Mowlam survived a brain tumour in the 1990s, which saw her lose her hair, forcing her to wear a wig. 

Many state that her charismatic personality played an important role in the &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Ireland"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt; peace talks, leading to the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 and an &lt;a href="w%3AIrish%20Republican%20Army"&gt;IRA&lt;/a&gt; ceasefire.

&lt;a href="w%3ARomania"&gt;Romania's&lt;/a&gt; level of foreign direct investment rose by 19% in the first six months (January-July) of 2005 when compared to the same period of 2004, according to the Romanian Agency for Foreign Investment (ARIS). The country recorded US$750 million of foreign investment in this period, and 56 total investment projects, in comparison to 40 projects between January and July 2004. The majority of the investments occurred in the &lt;a href="w%3ABucharest"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3AIlfov"&gt;Ilfov&lt;/a&gt; region, which includes the Romanian capital.

The rise in foreign investment is mainly attributed due to a more liberal taxation policy introduced by the Romanian government on January 1, 2005, which centres around a 16% &lt;a href="w%3Aflat%20tax"&gt;flat tax&lt;/a&gt; on personal income and corporate profit. Additionally, the country's expected membership of the European Union in 2007 and its relatively stable political climate also led to an increase in foreign investment in 2005.

The dog, named &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASnuppy"&gt;Snuppy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , was born on April 24. He is an &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAfghan%20hound"&gt;Afghan hound&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The issue presents a whole host of ethical questions for researchers in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Astem%20cell"&gt;stem cell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; field. 

Companies like &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAmgen"&gt;Amgen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are interested in the technology, as is accounted in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFortune%20Magazine"&gt;Fortune Magazine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for making human-safe pharmaceuticals. The business sector relies on &lt;a href="technology"&gt;technology&lt;/a&gt; improvements to make life saving realities.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20Times"&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has reported that Snuppy came from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADNA"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the tissue of the ear of the original canine. 

According to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AABC%20News"&gt;ABC News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="Associated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; reporter JI-SOO KIM, Korea has declared that we are still a long way from creating &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aclones"&gt;clones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Amonkeys"&gt;monkeys&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which have a great deal more human-like traits. 

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASlashdot"&gt;Slashdot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; actually reported an &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARSS%20feed"&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; yesterday at 4:15 p.m. regarding the &lt;a href="BBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AReuters%20News"&gt;Reuters News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; articles which told of the two successful terms of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Agestation"&gt;gestation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for Snuppy. "the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Korean"&gt;South Korean&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; team only obtained three pregnancies from more than 1,000 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aembryo"&gt;embryo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; transfers into 123 recipients." (BBC).

Kennel experts, according to the BBC, agree that there will be many moral issues to contend with, especially among pet lovers.

&lt;a href="w%3AHussain%20Osman"&gt;Hussain Osman&lt;/a&gt;, the suspect for the July 21 incident at Shepherds Bush who the UK authorities wish to extradite from Italy, claims that the device in his rucksack was merely a bag of flour with a detonator in it. 

Osman escaped from Britain via the &lt;a href="w%3AChannel%20Tunnel"&gt;Channel Tunnel&lt;/a&gt; and was arrested last week in Rome. He told his Italian lawyer that he was only staging a demonstration and had no intention of killing anyone.

Osman's claim contrasts starkly with &lt;a href="w%3AIan%20Blair"&gt;Sir Ian Blair&lt;/a&gt;'s statement shortly after the bombings. At that time Commissioner Blair said:

The weather forecast on Wednesday 27th July was poor which was unfortunate for Ross-on-Wye citizens, many of whom were dressed in historical costumes to greet the judges for the Heart of England in Bloom visit.

Friends faithfully turned up - women in their Quaker grey and white bonnets, and the Meeting House and burial ground were a hive of activity throughout the day. We welcomed Nelson and his lady, the Town Crier and John Kyrle, a well-known local benefactor from the 16th century as well as representatives from the Elizabethan, Victorian and Edwardian times right up to the world war two era. After some initial hesitation, our children entered into the fun of the day and looked very sweet in their Quaker costumes which they refused to take off at the end of the day.

Four short periods of Worship were held throughout the day and these were well-attended. Many enquiries about our ways followed and local people who had passed the outside gate frequently were surprised to find our 17th century building and the garden and burial ground at the rear. We were informed of a Gold award from Ross in Bloom for our ‘Secret’ garden and community involvement.

A display of old Quaker bonnets was offset by modern tee shirts and the Quakers Today exhibition from Friends House attracted much interest. Contents of a book box sold well and several people expressed their intention to worship with us. It was a good enlivening day.

A warning has been sent out by &lt;a href="w%3AOsama%20Bin%20Laden"&gt;Osama Bin Laden's&lt;/a&gt; lieutenant &lt;a href="w%3AAyman%20al-Zawahri"&gt;Ayman al-Zawahri&lt;/a&gt; saying that more attacks will be carried out because of &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair's&lt;/a&gt; foreign policy decisions.

The comments were from a videotape shown on the satellite television channel &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Jazeera"&gt;al-Jazeera&lt;/a&gt;. The message said was: "Blair has brought you destruction to the heart of London, and he will bring more destruction, God willing."

Al-Zawahri also warned other nations to leave Muslim lands to avoid further violence. He was quoted as saying: "What you have seen, O Americans, in New York and Washington and the losses you are having in Afghanistan and Iraq, in spite of all the media blackout, are only the losses of the initial clashes, If you continue the same policy of aggression against Muslims, God willing, you will see the horror that will make you forget what you had seen in Vietnam." 

Tony Blair has denied that his policies caused the &lt;a href="w%3A7%20July%202005%20London%20bombings"&gt;July 7&lt;/a&gt; bomb attacks. &lt;a href="w%3ADowning%20Street"&gt;Downing Street&lt;/a&gt; has refused to comment on the tape.

Police were on high alert today in London, with 6,000 officers watching for a repeat of the attacks two and four weeks ago and they continue to investigate the 7 July bombings and are holding 15 people in connection with the 21 July attempt.

Two were killed and at least four were injured in Thursday's explosion in &lt;a href="w%3APendik"&gt;Pendik&lt;/a&gt;, eastern &lt;a href="w%3AIstanbul"&gt;Istanbul&lt;/a&gt; suburb, &lt;a href="w%3ATurkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;. Some media reported that the blast occurred in a trash bin, while others say that it occurred in a moving vehicle.

A 21-year-old woman and her mother died in the blast. It is still unknown who is responsible.

This was the last of a series of explosions in Turkey, and trash bins have already been used for bombing. A similar explosion happened in &lt;a href="w%3AAntalya"&gt;Antalya&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, when two smaller explosions wounded nine people.

Other tourist resorts have been targeted as well. In July, mini-bus bombing killed five in &lt;a href="w%3AKusadasi"&gt;Kusadasi&lt;/a&gt;, and 20 were injured when a bomb in a dustbin exploded in &lt;a href="w%3ACesme"&gt;Cesme&lt;/a&gt;.

Speaking in &lt;a href="w%3ATexas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; in a Wednesday address to the &lt;a href="w%3A%20American%20Legislative%20Exchange%20Council"&gt;American Legislative Exchange Council&lt;/a&gt; in the city of &lt;a href="w%3A%20Grapevine%2C%20Texas"&gt;Grapevine&lt;/a&gt; said, "The violence in recent days in Iraq is a grim reminder of the enemies we face."
"After September the 11th, I made a commitment to the American people that the United States of America will not wait to be attacked again." Bush said. "We will take the fight to the enemy, and we will defend our freedom."

There has been debate within the Administration as to how to refer to the ongoing conflict. In recent appearances, Defense Secretary &lt;a href="w%3ADonald%20Rumsfeld"&gt;Donald Rumsfeld&lt;/a&gt; has avoided using the word "war", preferring the phrase "global struggle against violent extremism." Bush's speech marks a return to the existing phrase "war on terror". In the speech he acknowledged that the struggle is against those who use terror to achieve their goals, implicitly recognising that the term "war on terror" may be misleading. 

"Make no mistake about it, this is a war against people who profess an ideology, and they use terror as a means to achieve their objectives," he said.

Of the military strategy in Iraq, Bush said that coalition forces continue to hunt down terrorists, and the Iraqi security forces are being trained to take on more responsibility. "As Iraqis stand up, Americans and coalition forces will stand down," Bush said. "And we're making progress. More and more Iraqi units are more and more capable of defending themselves."

The return of American forces to U.S. soil will be event-driven decision, he said. A timetable for withdrawal is not practical because it would give the enemy a tactical event upon which to plan.

Politically, Iraq's National Assembly is working on a constitution that members pledged to have ready by August 15. The Iraqi people would then vote on the constitution October 15. If passed, the new Iraqi government under a constitution would be elected December 15.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; has lost twenty-one &lt;a href="w%3A%20United%20States%20Marine%20Corps"&gt;Marines&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; since August 1.

Wolfgang said,

"Being an occasional attender and in the process of learning more about Friends, I've been impressed with the &lt;a href="Quaker"&gt;Quaker&lt;/a&gt; tradition of putting one's beliefs into action. Groups like Quaker Social Action are living testimony to that practice. There is a direct connection between spiritual and social activity, that serves us as a constant reminder to live in the Here and Now. Not all of us are able or willing to commit time to social issues, others can or want to commit only money or support; both are essential to those helping and to those in need. 
That's why I decided to support QSA."

Judith Moran, QSA Director followed, "We are extremely grateful to Wolfgang, not only for donating the image but for his support in producing the card, we think it looks wonderful!"

In a speech in &lt;a href="w%3ATexas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday, &lt;a href="w%3Apresident"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; discussed the &lt;a href="w%3Atrade%20deficit"&gt;trade deficit&lt;/a&gt;, saying:

"We had a problem in our &lt;a href="w%3Ahemisphere"&gt;hemisphere&lt;/a&gt; about trade. I don't know if you realize it or not, but most of the goods from &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20America"&gt;Central America&lt;/a&gt; came into this country &lt;a href="w%3Aduty-free"&gt;duty-free&lt;/a&gt;. Yet eighty percent of our goods were taxed through &lt;a href="w%3Atariff"&gt;tariffs&lt;/a&gt; in Central American countries. That didn't seem to make sense to me; it certainly wasn't fair. All I say to people is you treat us the way we treat you. If your goods can come into our &lt;a href="w%3Amarket%20economy"&gt;markets&lt;/a&gt; duty-free, our goods ought to be able to go into your markets duty-free."

According to the &lt;a href="w%3ABureau%20of%20Economic%20Analysis"&gt;Bureau of Economic Analysis&lt;/a&gt; International Economic Accounts Balance of Payments,

"The deficit on goods increased to $186.3 billion from $182.2 billion, as goods imports increased more than exports. More than half the increase in imports was in &lt;a href="w%3Aconsumer%20goods"&gt;consumer goods&lt;/a&gt;. Much of the increase in exports was in &lt;a href="w%3Aindustry"&gt;industrial&lt;/a&gt; supplies and materials, in
consumer goods, and in &lt;a href="w%3Acapital%20goods"&gt;capital goods&lt;/a&gt;."

In the US, the DR-CAFTA (&lt;a href="w%3ADominican%20Republic-Central%20America%20Free%20Trade%20Agreement"&gt;Dominican Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement&lt;/a&gt;, or simply CAFTA) bill passed by two votes. At present in contention is the &lt;a href="w%3AAndean%20Free%20Trade%20Agreement"&gt;Andean Free Trade Agreement&lt;/a&gt;.

"The House passed H.R. 304, to implement the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement [CAFTA], by a recorded vote of 217 ayes to 215 noes, Roll No. 443." 

The bill passed by a slight &lt;a href="w%3Amajority"&gt;majority&lt;/a&gt; in both the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt;.

President Bush met for lunch with &lt;a href="w%3AColombia"&gt;Colombian&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="w%3AAlvaro%20Uribe"&gt;Alvaro Uribe&lt;/a&gt; at the Bush Ranch in &lt;a href="w%3ATexas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; and communicated his desire for the future prosperity of a Colombia free of &lt;a href="w%3AIllegal%20drug%20trade"&gt;drug trafficking&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aviolence"&gt;violence&lt;/a&gt;.

Afghan citizens currently held captive in &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; prisons at &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20Bay"&gt;Guantanamo Bay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABagram%20Air%20Base"&gt;Bagram&lt;/a&gt; will be transferred to the custody of &lt;a href="w%3AAfghanistan"&gt;Afghan&lt;/a&gt; authorities following an agreement reached Thursday between United States diplomats and &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20Afghanistan"&gt;Afghan President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AHamid%20Karzai"&gt;Hamid Karzai&lt;/a&gt;. The agreement did not immediately establish a timetable for the repatriation. None of the detainees have been charged with any crimes.

Karim Rahimi, the Afghani presidential spokesman said today, "Afghanistan and the United States reached an understanding that will allow for the gradual transfer of Afghan detainees to the exclusive custody and control of the Afghan government."

The U.S. government spokesman Lou Fintor said, "The United States intends to assist the government of Afghanistan in building its capacity to detain these individuals, this process is part of our ongoing efforts to transfer detainees to their home countries as appropriate and when we receive assurances that the country can and will take appropriate steps to ensure that these individuals do not pose a continuing threat."

Fintor said the decision was reached after, &lt;a href="w%3APierre-Richard%20Prosper"&gt;Pierre-Richard Prosper&lt;/a&gt;, U.S. ambassador-at-large for war crimes, and Matthew Waxman, the Pentagon's deputy assistant secretary of defense for detainee affairs, met with President Karzai on Thursday. There are still 520 detainees at the Guantanamo Bay prison facility.

Investigations continued Thursday after a prominent Iranian judge, Hassan Moghaddas, was assassinated in the middle of his evening commute Tuesday evening. Iranian police have so far attributed the killing to "...some mad gesture or a settling of accounts."

Judge Moghaddas presided over several controversial cases in his career, including the sentencing of Iranian reporter &lt;a href="w%3AAkbar%20Ganji"&gt;Akbar Ganji&lt;/a&gt; and was also unsuccessfully subpoenaed to testify in an investigation into the death of Canadian-Iranian reporter &lt;a href="w%3AZahra%20Kazemi"&gt;Zahra Kazemi&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>NATO to expand Afghanistan presence</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=NATO%20to%20expand%20Afghanistan%20presence&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

NATO has confirmed today that it intends to expand its presence in &lt;a href="w%3AAfghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; by sending forces into the south and east of the country in 2006. The move will see NATO take the lead role in Afghan security. 

Presently, much of NATO's 8,000-strong &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Security%20Assistance%20Force"&gt;International Security Assistance Force&lt;/a&gt; (ISAF) is based in the capital &lt;a href="w%3AKabul"&gt;Kabul&lt;/a&gt;, with units also based in the north and west of the country.

The NATO decision has been welcomed by the United States who hope that they will be able to withdraw some of its 19,000 troops from Afghanistan. The US forces are based in the south &amp;mdash; the centre of much of the violence against Coalition forces in the country &amp;mdash; and are not under NATO command.

Ironically, in the aftermath of the invasion of Afghanistan, the US opposed the move amid requests by Afghans for NATO to spread across the country. 
Today, Turkey handed over control of ISAF to an &lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;-led unit, commanded by Italian Liuetenant-General &lt;a href="w%3AMauro%20Del%20Vecchio"&gt;Mauro Del Vecchio&lt;/a&gt;. The deputy-commander is British Major-General &lt;a href="w%3ARoger%20Lane"&gt;Roger Lane&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Marines"&gt;Royal Marines&lt;/a&gt;, who previously served in the country in 2002.

Command of ISAF rotates every six-months. Previous ISAF commanders have been &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt;, British, &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt;.

A recent surge in violence against NATO and US forces &amp;mdash; blamed on &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Qaida"&gt;Al Qaida&lt;/a&gt; and the remnants of the deposed &lt;a href="w%3ATaliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt; regime &amp;mdash; has seen nearly 1000 people killed since March. 

NATO intends to send an additional 2,000 troops for the Afghanistan parliamentary elections scheduled to take place next month. &lt;a href="w%3AHamid%20Karzai"&gt;Hamid Karzai&lt;/a&gt; became the first democratically elected president of Afghanistan after presidential elections were held on 9 October 2004.

It is believed that the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Army"&gt;British Army&lt;/a&gt; will deploy up to 5,000 troops next year, likely to be made up of the élite &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%2016%20Air%20Assault%20Brigade"&gt;16 Air Assault Brigade&lt;/a&gt;.

Thirty-four summary executions were carried out in &lt;a href="w%3ABurundi"&gt;Burundi&lt;/a&gt; during July, says ONUB, the UN's mission to the war-torn country. The figures were announced at a press conference yesterday in the Burundian capital &lt;a href="w%3ABujumbura"&gt;Bujumbura&lt;/a&gt;. 

ONUB rights chief Ismael Diallo accused government forces and members of the hardlined Hutu rebel group Palipehutu-FNL of being behind most of the violence.

Diallo outlined a "grim picture", according to a &lt;a href="w%3AUN"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; press release, with human rights violations taking place every day, and no arrests ever being made. The violence is continuing despite the success of recent elections in the country. 

Analysts have argued that Burundi is in the grip of a "culture of &lt;a href="w%3Aimpunity"&gt;impunity&lt;/a&gt;", which perpetuates the cycle of violence. 

"For reasons of diplomacy, people are sitting at the exact same table as war criminals, and in some cases granting them immunity. If the atrocities are to end there must be at least some indications that justice will be done", &lt;a href="w%3AHuman%20Rights%20Watch"&gt;Human Rights Watch&lt;/a&gt; spokesman Stephan Van Praet told Reuters, following last year's &lt;a href="w%3AGatumba"&gt;Gatumba&lt;/a&gt; massacre.

August 13th will mark the first anniversary of the attack, in which 152 Congolese Tutsi refugees were shot, hacked and burned to death. Despite widespread international condemnation, no arrests have yet been made and a UN investigation has stalled.

An estimated 300,000 people, mostly &lt;a href="w%3Acivilians"&gt;civilians&lt;/a&gt;, have died in Burundi since civil war broke out in 1993.

I-Holding ehf, a Icelandic investment company owned by Baugur Group, Straumur investment bank, B2B Holdings and Birgis Bieltvedts, has bought 80% in Illum warehouse in Denmark from Merrill Lynch International Global Principal Investment. The same group recently bought Wessel &amp; Vett A/S and Magasin du Nord, so it already owned 20% in Illum.

Illum will be run separately from Magasin du Nord.

Illum reported a profit and 11% gain in sales the first three months of 2005.

Skarphéðni Berg Steinarssyni from Nordic Investment at Baugur Group said the Danish retail market is increasing and they believe in Illum because it's a well known brand in Denmark.

♡❤♡Icelanders invest in Denmark and UK♡❤♡

Icelandic companies have been investing heavily in Denmark for the last few years. Recently the Fons Investment ehf. bought the Danish airlines Sterling Air and Mearsk Air. Eimskip, a shipping company in Iceland, recently bought the shipping division of Mearsk. I-Holdings have been investing heavily in the Denish retailer market.

Baugur Group, as well as FL Group, have been investing in the UK market. FL Group has bought 11% in easyJet.com and has shown an interest in buying more. Baugur Group has been investing in the retailer market and has bought among other things Iceland supermarket chain as well as Hamleys, a well known toy store.

A uniformed &lt;a href="w%3AAWOL"&gt;AWOL&lt;/a&gt; Israeli private suddenly opened fire in a crowded bus, killing 4 &lt;a href="w%3AIsraeli%20Arab"&gt;Israeli Arab&lt;/a&gt;s and wounding 12. A mob stormed the bus and beat the shooter to death. The &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israeli&lt;/a&gt; government condemned the random shooting and mobilized troops in anticipation of &lt;a href="w%3Ariot"&gt;riot&lt;/a&gt;ing in northern Israel.

The attacker, Eden Natan-Zada, 19, boarded &lt;a href="w%3AEgged"&gt;Egged&lt;/a&gt; bus 165 en route from &lt;a href="w%3AHaifa"&gt;Haifa&lt;/a&gt; and sat mid-section. When the bus, carrying about 10&amp;ndash;15 passengers, neared the bus stop at the center of the &lt;a href="w%3ADruze"&gt;Druze&lt;/a&gt; neighborhood of the predominantly Israeli Arab town of &lt;a href="w%3AShefa-Amr"&gt;Shefa-Amr&lt;/a&gt; in lower Galilee, Natan-Zada, walked to the front. When the bus stopped he shot the driver in the head with his &lt;a href="w%3AM16%20%28rifle%29"&gt;M16&lt;/a&gt; and began systematically firing as passengers crouched behind seats. He repeatedly shot Hazar Turki, 23 and her sister, Dina, 21, apparently to make sure they were dead.

As Natan-Zada was reloading his rifle and a young girl pleaded with him to spare her, Ahayal Jahnawi, 28 began struggling with the gunman. He succeeded in pinning Natan-Zada to the floor until the crowd broke into the bus. At first the mob mistook Jahnawi for the perpetrator and began pummeling him. They then began kicking and hurling objects at Natan-Zada. The security officer of Shefa-Amr, Jamal Aliam reportedly told Army Radio that Zada had been attacked by dozens after he had been handcuffed and subdued by police. Police were unable to control the mob, which wounded 5 officers. &lt;a href="w%3AMagen%20David%20Adom"&gt;Magen David Adom&lt;/a&gt; ambulances evacuated the wounded to Rambam Medical Center in Haifa.

Natan-Zada had been absent without leave from his army unit since mid-June after refusing to participate in preparations for the &lt;a href="w%3AGaza"&gt;Gaza&lt;/a&gt; pullout. He moved to &lt;a href="w%3AKfar%20Tapuach"&gt;Kfar Tapuach&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Bank"&gt;West Bank&lt;/a&gt; Jewish settlement dominated by the militant &lt;a href="w%3AKach%20and%20Kahane%20Chai"&gt;Kach&lt;/a&gt; movement. His father Yitzhak Natan-Zada urged Eden to return his weapon and informed the army that his son was dangerous. Eden's mother Debbie, speaking from the family home in &lt;a href="w%3ARishon%20LeZion"&gt;Rishon LeZion&lt;/a&gt; was told that someone must be AWOL for 45 days to be officially considered a &lt;a href="w%3Adeserter"&gt;deserter&lt;/a&gt; and was advised to go herself to Kfar Tapuah to disarm her son.

Eden had recently become more &lt;a href="w%3Afanaticism"&gt;fanatical&lt;/a&gt; and encountered writings on the &lt;a href="w%3AInternet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href="w%3Arevenge"&gt;revenge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Azealot"&gt;zealot&lt;/a&gt;s in Judaism published by the outlawed &lt;a href="w%3Aterrorism"&gt;terrorist&lt;/a&gt; Kach group in ♡❤The Way of the Torah♡❤. He befriended people from Tapuah over the Internet and apparently became involved in resistance to plans to remove Jewish settlers from territory slated to be turned over to Palestinian control.

When called up into the &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael%20Defense%20Forces"&gt;Israel Defense Forces&lt;/a&gt; (IDF) for &lt;a href="w%3Arecruit%20training"&gt;basic training&lt;/a&gt; in May 2005 Natan-Zada went reluctantly, then refused to obey an order and was briefly imprisoned. He spurned advice to seek a psychiatric discharge under Section 21 of military regulations. According to his father, "When they told him to set up a tent city [next to Kibbutz Re'im] in opposition to his views, he deserted and went to Tapuah."

The airline &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Airways"&gt;British Airways&lt;/a&gt; have reported that they will start flying between Iceland and Gatwick airport, London. British Airways said they will provide the service five times a week; the first flight is scheduled March 26, 2006.

Until now, only two airlines have been flying between the UK and Iceland with passengers: &lt;a href="w%3AIcelandair"&gt;Icelandair&lt;/a&gt;, the oldest and biggest airline in Iceland, and &lt;a href="w%3AIceland%20Express"&gt;Iceland Express&lt;/a&gt;, a recent low-fare airline and the competition between them has been fierce.

Icelandair's PR, Guðjón Arngrímsson, said that Icelandair welcomes the competition and believes Icelandair can compete with BA: "This market has been growing rapidly. Iceland has been well marketed in London and Britain as a whole so number of passenger has been rising fast. We're always ready for more competition on every route between Iceland and other countries. We're ready and willing to compete here as we are on other routes" Arngrímsson said.

Birgir Jónsson at Iceland Express agrees. "Iceland Express welcomes the competition without a doubt." He then added, "The competition will benefit us all".

British Airways have reported the tickets will cost about €291.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACanberra%2C%20Australia"&gt;Canberra, Australia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 

An explosion and subsequent chemical fire at the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20National%20University"&gt;Australian National University&lt;/a&gt; this afternoon caused an estimated AU$1 million in damage and forced the evacuation of most of the main campus.

The initial explosion occurred on the top floor of the Research School of Chemistry in the early afternoon, and caused a fire which quickly spread throughout the rest of the floor. While no one was injured, the &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Courier-Mail"&gt;Brisbane Courier-Mail&lt;/a&gt; is reporting "widespread damage" to the laboratories. Furthermore, a number of computers containing postgraduate student theses were destroyed, causing the loss of months of work.

As the fire spread a cloud of potentially toxic smoke formed. A large number of fire personnel were called to the site and police, with limited success, attempted to cordon off access to the university. 

Buildings downwind were progressively evacuated, including the central union building and students association at approximately 3pm. 

Students in the buildings were asked to leave the campus entirely. There was a great deal of confusion afterwards. Police were able to clear the buildings successfully, but had some difficulty evacuating those who were already outside. 

The university sent an email message giving a brief explanation of the situation at around the same time, but this did not reach most students immediately, leading to widespread confusion as to what exactly was going on.

Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research) Lawrence Cram sent an follow-up email to the students at approximately 3.30 p.m. stating that the fire was under control and suggesting that the students in the affected areas should go home. 

There were reports of activities being cancelled at the other end of the campus late into the afternoon.

While the remainder of the university will reopen Saturday, it is not currently known when the Research School will reopen, or just how severely the fire will affect ongoing academic programs at the university.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Stranded%20Russian%20minisub%20is%20trapped%20by%2060%20tonne%20anchor&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInterfax"&gt;Interfax&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; news agency is reporting that a &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n minisub that was stranded underwater in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Ocean"&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is trapped by two 60 tonne anchors.

The submarine propeller has snagged on the antenna of a sonar underwater coastal defense station, (or perhaps very long low frequency arrays, which can be thousands of yards) 623 ft below the ocean 43 miles off &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKamchatka"&gt;Kamchatka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . "The anchor needs to be blown up" in order to be able to raise the AS-28 submarine, the commander of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Ocean%20Fleet%20%28Russia%29"&gt;Russian Pacific Fleet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; told Interfax.

"If the explosion is successful, the system will be raised to a depth of 100 meters and lit up by the Tiger [television camera], and we can at last be 100% sure that it's the submarine, and deepwater divers will be able to continue work," he continued.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAS-28"&gt;AS-28&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; submarine, with seven crew onboard, became entangled on Thursday while at a depth of 190 m.

Earlier reports that the submarine had been taken under tow have been proved false. Ships had attempted to trawl for the submarine in order to drag it into shallower water, but it is reported that they failed to capture the submarine.

The Pacific Fleet commander says that the crew have enough food and water to survive until Monday although oxygen will run out by Saturday. The three-man submarine was designed to supply the crew with a five day supply of oxygen, however with the seven man crew the supply has been greatly depleted.

Around ten Russian navy ships are attending, to be joined by four Japanese vessels on Monday. The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="UK"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; navies are also flying in specialist rescue equipment, including two U.S. navy owned remotely-operated underwater robots capable of cutting through steel lines up to 1" thick and one U.K. video array &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARemotely%20operated%20vehicle"&gt;ROV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . They will arrive on Saturday.

The crew have been using an underwater acoustic telephone to communicate with the surface, and are reported to be remaining calm. They have been told to keep still and to conserve the ship's power supplies.

The same class of vessel, which measures 13.5 m by 3.8 m, was used during the ill-fated rescue attempt on the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARussian%20submarine%20K-141%20Kursk"&gt;Kursk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which was lost with all hands almost exactly five years ago.

The journalist who first revealed in print the &lt;a href="w%3AValerie%20Plame"&gt;Valerie Plame&lt;/a&gt; CIA connection, &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Novak"&gt;Robert Novak&lt;/a&gt;, angrily left the set of an ♡❤Inside Politics♡❤ segment Thursday night.

The discussion, led by Ed Henry of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, centered on the &lt;a href="w%3AFlorida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; republican &lt;a href="w%3A%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House&lt;/a&gt; representative &lt;a href="w%3AKatherine%20Harris"&gt;Katherine Harris&lt;/a&gt; election prospects in a possible square-off against Florida’s democratic &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; representative &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Nelson%20%28politician%29"&gt;Bill Nelson&lt;/a&gt;. 

The ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AChicago%20Sun-Times"&gt;Chicago Sun-Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ syndicated columnist and ♡❤CNN♡❤ contributor, Novak took offense when co-appearing &lt;a href="w%3A%20James%20Carville"&gt;James Carville&lt;/a&gt; interrupted Novak when he was defending the Harris election victory chances. "Let me just finish, James, please," Novak said. "I know you hate to hear me, but you have to."

Carville countered with, "He's got to show these right-wingers that he's got a backbone, you know. It's why the Wall Street Journal editorial page is watching you. Show 'em that you're tough."

The discussion was shortened when Novak responded to Carville saying, "Well, I think that's bullshit, and I hate that." Then, with a wave of his hand to moderator Henry, Novak said, "Just let it go." Novak stood and then left the set. Henry never got to ask Novak about his role in the federal probe on the Plame leak led by &lt;a href="w%3A%20Patrick%20Fitzgerald"&gt;Patrick Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt;.

♡❤CNN♡❤ suspended Novak indefinitely, despite his apology to the organization. The network said in a statement. "Mr. Novak has apologized to CNN, and CNN apologizes to its viewers for his language and actions. We've asked Mr. Novak to take some time off."

A &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; lobbyist group, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUSA%20Next"&gt;United Seniors Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABoston%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to recover &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMedicare%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Medicare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; expenses related to tobacco smoking. The suit says there is a link between &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATobacco%20smoking"&gt;nicotine addiction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and smoking-related diseases. 

The first of its kind lawsuit seeks to recover as much as $60 billion in estimated Medicare expenses outlaid for treatment of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Alung%20cancer"&gt;lung cancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aemphysema"&gt;emphysema&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; patients.

The ♡❤Medicare Secondary Payer Statute♡❤ (MSP) allows someone to sue on behalf of Medicare. The medical expenses that another party was legally obligated to cover, in this case the tobacco companies if they are found liable in court, would be split between parties to the suit and Medicare. The MSP statute was entered in part because the government does not have the resources to prosecute every case under Medicare law.

Charles Jarvis, the CEO of the group said, "Our motivation is one of taxpayer protection." He added, "Considering how badly the taxpayers have been injured financially, we believe the responsible parties &amp;mdash; the tobacco companies &amp;mdash; should be reimbursing the taxpayer to the greatest amount possible under the law." 

Currently, U.S. employees are taxed by Medicare at 1.45% of their earnings. This payroll tax amount is matched by their employer when paid to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Internal%20Revenue%20Service"&gt;IRS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The lawsuit names &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APhilip%20Morris%20USA"&gt;Philip Morris USA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALoews%20Corporation"&gt;Lorillard Tobacco&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALiggett%20Group"&gt;Liggett Group&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AReynolds%20American%20Inc."&gt;R.J. Reynolds Tobacco&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and two of its subsidiaries as defendants. The United Seniors Association is asking for twice the amount paid by Medicare to treat smoking related illnesses since 1999.

A plane crash 13 km from &lt;a href="w%3APalermo"&gt;Palermo&lt;/a&gt; and 12 miles North East of Capo Gallo off the &lt;a href="w%3ASicily"&gt;Sicilian&lt;/a&gt; coast killed at least 14 people.

A &lt;a href="w%3ATuninter"&gt;Tuninter&lt;/a&gt; flight was carrying 39 people (34 passengers and 5 crew members) when it went down near Sicily.

A magistrate of Palermo said there were 20 survivors.

The Tunisian ATR-72 airliner had taken off from Bari and is believed to have developed a technical fault. All the passengers are reportedly Italian.

Ten passengers have reached land in Palermo, a city on the southern Italian island of Sicily. "It's a miracle we're alive," a survivor said, according to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAnsa"&gt;Ansa&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

The plane went into the sea after the captain asked for an emergency landing at &lt;a href="w%3APalermo%20International%20Airport"&gt;Palermo Punta Raisi&lt;/a&gt; airport. When the captain realized he could not reach the airport, he was forced to crash-land the plane at sea. The captain Chafik Garbis told ♡❤Ansa♡❤, "The engines have lost power and I have had to try to ditch."

Most of the survivors have been injured, and the majority have signs of serious burns. The casualties from the crash were worsened due to a fire spreading out before, or just after, the plane ditched.

The wreck of the airplane was found broken in three parts.

The number of the fatalities is not yet clearly known. A member of the Italian aviation reported to the Italian Radio ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ARai"&gt;Rai&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ while coming back to land from the area of the crash that some people are not yet found. 

The Italian ♡❤ANSV♡❤ (Agenzia nazionale sicurezza al volo, or National Agency for Flight Safety) opened an investigation into the crash. It will also involve France (where the ATR planes were built) and Tunisia.

The ♡❤Pubblico Ministero♡❤ of Palermo (the judge who is in charge of investigation) said to the Italian television ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ARai"&gt;Rai&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, "Luckly, and this is the most important thing, we can exclude that it is due to a terrorism attack." He then added that the investigation has not yet formally started so he needs more time to be sure.

U.S. airline passengers may need to brace for longer lines at security screening checkpoints as the &lt;a href="w%3ATransportation%20Security%20Administration"&gt;Transportation Security Administration&lt;/a&gt; (TSA) announced plans to reduce the number of security screeners in US airports. The cutbacks come despite an increased TSA budget for 2006 over 2005 and an overall increase in &lt;a href="w%3Aairport"&gt;airport&lt;/a&gt; traffic. 

The &lt;a href="w%3APortland%2C%20Oregon"&gt;Portland, Oregon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMedford%2C%20Oregon"&gt;Medford, Oregon&lt;/a&gt; airports were among the hardest-hit by cutbacks, with Portland seeing a 30% decline in security screeners.

Travellers are advised to check with the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.tsa.gov/public/index.jsp"&gt;TSA&lt;/a&gt; or the airport to plan for delays at check-in.

&lt;a href="w%3ARobin%20Cook"&gt;Robin Cook&lt;/a&gt;, the former British foreign secretary and current Member of Parliament, has died of a suspected heart attack after collapsing on a walk with his wife on &lt;a href="w%3ABen%20Stack"&gt;Ben Stack&lt;/a&gt; hill, &lt;a href="w%3AScotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;. Cook, aged 59, was flown to a hospital in &lt;a href="w%3AInverness"&gt;Inverness&lt;/a&gt; by a rescue service helicopter half an hour after collapsing. 

A spokesperson for NHS Highland said that Mr. Cook arrived at hospital 90 minutes after his collapse, and was reported dead five minutes later. A postmortem examination has concluded that he died from hypertensive heart disease.

Mr. Cook was buried on August 12 at St Giles Cathedral in &lt;a href="w%3AEdinburgh"&gt;Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt; in a service attended by close family, friends and political figures from across the world. British Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; however came under attack from Mr. Cooks friend and racing pundit John McCririck for his absence from the service. 

Robin Cook served as Foreign Secretary under New Labour and was a critic of the war in Iraq. He resigned as Leader of the House of Commons in 2003 in protest against Prime Minister Blair's foreign policies.

The 60th anniversary of the &lt;a href="w%3AAtomic%20bombings%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki"&gt;first use of an atomic bomb against people&lt;/a&gt; has been remembered in a ceremony yesterday in &lt;a href="w%3AHiroshima"&gt;Hiroshima&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;.

The atomic bomb, code-named "&lt;a href="w%3ALittle%20Boy"&gt;Little Boy&lt;/a&gt;", was dropped on Hiroshima at precisely 08:15 on August 6, 1945 by the specially converted &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Army%20Air%20Force"&gt;United States Army Air Force&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AB-29%20Superfortress"&gt;B-29 Superfortress&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AEnola%20Gay"&gt;Enola Gay&lt;/a&gt;.

The recommendation to drop the atomic bomb without warning was made by an eight-man committee headed by &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge_L._Harrison"&gt;George Harrison&lt;/a&gt; who was Secretary of War &lt;a href="w%3AHenry_L._Stimson"&gt;Henry Stimson's&lt;/a&gt; special assistant for matters relating to the development of the atomic bomb. Both Harrison and Stimson were members of &lt;a href="w%3ASkull%20and%20Bones"&gt;Skull and Bones&lt;/a&gt;

Three days later, another atomic bomb "&lt;a href="w%3AFat%20Man"&gt;Fat Man&lt;/a&gt;", was dropped on nearby &lt;a href="w%3ANagasaki"&gt;Nagasaki&lt;/a&gt;.

The Japanese Government surrendered unconditionally on 15 August, and signed the formal surrender on the &lt;a href="w%3AUSS%20Missouri%20%28BB-63%29"&gt;USS Missouri&lt;/a&gt; on 2 September in &lt;a href="w%3ATokyo%20Bay"&gt;Tokyo Bay&lt;/a&gt;.

The dropping of the bomb has been condemned by critics and anti-nuclear campaigners, who say other methods could have been used to end the war. Advocates, however, say that an invasion of Japan &amp;mdash; to be known as &lt;a href="w%3AOperation%20Downfall"&gt;Operation Downfall&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; would have cost millions of Allied and Japanese lives, citing the ferocity of fighting experienced during the &lt;a href="w%3ABattle%20of%20Okinawa"&gt;Battle of Okinawa&lt;/a&gt;, and that the bombings avoided this. 

Approximately 140,000 people died within days from the initial blast and during the following year from radiation. The total death toll was almost half of Hiroshima's population.

"As the years go by so many of my friends and relatives die. This must not be forgotten." Sunao Tsuboi, a survivor of the bombing, said. Now he is 80, and he recounted some of the details of what he witnessed that day:

"We were all barefoot. One woman's skin was hanging from her chest, another woman's eye was hanging from its socket and resting on her chin, and one young girl's guts had spilled out."

Tsuboi saw people jumping into a river which was already full of bodies. He said, "I was thinking that if I die here, I would feel so sad and alone. Everyone had given up; no help was coming.We were beyond pain." Tsuboi has since lost skin on his forehead and nose as well as part of his ears. He still goes to hospital every two weeks for treatment.

The &lt;a href="w%3AFinland"&gt;Finnish&lt;/a&gt; police isolated the ports of &lt;a href="w%3AKatajanokka"&gt;Katajanokka&lt;/a&gt; and Länsisatama on Saturday. The ports were isolated at around 9.30 p.m. local time and the isolation was called off at around 11.30 p.m.

Finnish police received reports from Estonia that a shipping container loaded with explosives could be coming from &lt;a href="w%3AEstonia"&gt;Estonia&lt;/a&gt; Saturday evening. They checked every truck that passed the ports with the assistance of the Border Guard Service. There are still two ships due to arrive in &lt;a href="w%3AHelsinki"&gt;Helsinki&lt;/a&gt; tonight, but they were already checked in &lt;a href="w%3ATallinn"&gt;Tallinn&lt;/a&gt;.

A Russian submarine trapped during a training exercise in Berezov Bay, 75 km south of Petropavlovsk in Kamchatka, has been rescued after it was cut free by a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Navy"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARemotely%20operated%20underwater%20vehicle"&gt;Remotely Operated Vehicle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (ROV). The crew of seven officers and midshipmen, who spent three days in temperatures around 6C and were running out of oxygen supplies, were unharmed. 

The submarine appeared on the surface at 4:15 p.m. local time. "The crew opened the hatch and climbed the rescue ship's deck on their own," said Admiral Victor Fyedorov. The first aid to the crew was given on ship ♡❤Alagez♡❤, and they were transferred to Petropavlovsk-Kamchatka hospital.

The British &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AScorpio%20ROV"&gt;Scorpio ROV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; cut fishing nets and debris, freeing the trapped submarine. "The rescue operation was completed successfully. We thank everyone, and especially the British rescue crew," said Fyedorov.

The submarine will be repaired and modernized. "After salvaging it, AS-28 will be carried on one of the rescue ship's decks to the coast, where specialists will examine it," said a spokesperson of VMS ("Company for secondary metal and boats"). Russian President &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVladimir%20Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has pledged an inquiry into the incident.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; also sent equipment to help in the rescue. However, it was not used.

On Thursday, August 4 Wikimedia opened its doors to the first ever &lt;a href="w%3AWikimania"&gt;Wikimania&lt;/a&gt; Conference, a five-day event put together by the &lt;a href="w%3AWikimedia"&gt;Wikimedia Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. 

The event, held in the Haus der Jugend in &lt;a href="w%3AFrankfurt%20am%20Main"&gt;Frankfurt am Main&lt;/a&gt;, Germany, featured discussion and interaction on all Wikimedia projects, including its well known &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; project, an online encyclopedia which touts figures of millions of articles in over 150 languages. 

Wikimania expressed that its purpose as a conference was to get wikimedians to meet each other face to face, to provide several workshops and talks on all aspects of Wikimedia sites, and to introduce Wikimedia and its projects to the press.

Wikimania, with a core organisation team of eight people and a staff of 23, drew in more than 100 members of press and 70 speakers, and at least 350 delegates from 52 countries were at the conference on Saturday, August 6. Among delegates, nine from developing countries were sponsored their travel and accommodation costs by &lt;a href="w%3AOpen%20Source%20Initiative"&gt;Open Source Initiative&lt;/a&gt;.

Users not directly at the conference were encouraged to listen in through Freematrix Radio's online broadcasts, which at the highest point drew 37 concurrent listeners. Users could also connect with the conference via &lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20Relay%20Chat"&gt;Internet Relay Chat&lt;/a&gt;, and interact with people physically present.

One of Sundays's speakers was &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Stallman"&gt;Richard Stallman&lt;/a&gt;, one of the leading lights of the &lt;a href="w%3AFree%20software"&gt;Free Software&lt;/a&gt; movement. &lt;a href="w%3AWard%20Cunningham"&gt;Ward Cunningham&lt;/a&gt;, inventor of the &lt;a href="w%3Awiki"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;, held a keynote about the past and future of wikis on Saturday morning. On Friday evening there was a keynote speech on wikis and politics as well as a panel discussion with the Foundation Board.

&lt;a href="w%3AJimmy%20Wales"&gt;Jimbo Wales&lt;/a&gt;, the founder of Wikipedia, was himself present, and gave a speech based on his concept of ♡❤Ten Things That Want To Be Free♡❤. Wales found himself swamped by press attention on the Saturday after a misquote in a Reuters article seemed to suggest that he believed Wikipedia may need to be locked from editing. Wales later issued a statement clarifying that this is ♡❤not♡❤ the case.

The conference was described by many as a professional, occasionally "laid back", but worthwhile event.

The 2002 collapse of the Antarctic &lt;a href="w%3ALarsen%20Ice%20Shelf"&gt;Larsen B Ice Shelf&lt;/a&gt;, which seemingly had remained stable for 10,000 years, has revealed a &lt;a href="w%3Acold%20seep"&gt;cold seep&lt;/a&gt; containing ecosystems that seem to have been isolated from the outside world for 10,000 years by a 600-foot ice shelf.

The discovery was made during an expedition led by Eugene Domack investigating the cause of the collapse. He concluded that the collapse was caused by long term gradual thinning of the shelf, followed by a recent increase in surface air temperature.

The cold seep is nearly 1.5 million square kilometers in area, and sits about 2,800 feet below the surface. The source of energy for the ecosystem has not yet been discovered, but Domack and his colleagues propose that it is methane, rather than sunlight or hot vents, that supplies energy to the system.

Domack warns that the collapse of the ice shelf may have disrupted and may possibly destroy the unusual ecosystem.

The famous Cuban singer and member of the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABuena%20Vista%20Social%20Club"&gt;Buena Vista Social Club&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, Ibrahim Ferrer, died Saturday in Havana, Cuba, at the age of 78. The cause was an illness with which he returned from a tour of Europe.

Ferrer was born February 20, 1927 near Santiago de Cuba. He became an orphan at 12 and started working in coffee fields, carried sugar, worked in shipyards, sold newspapers and candy, and cleaned shoes. He was also singing in local bars and Orquesta Chepin-Choven noticed him. They recorded a locally successful song ♡❤El Platanar de Bartolo♡❤, but he did not get much credit for it. 

He got world famous only when he got old, as a part of ♡❤Buena Vista Social Club♡❤. He recorded two solo albums: ♡❤Buena Vista Social Club presents Ibrahim Ferrer♡❤ and ♡❤Buenos Hermanos♡❤.

&lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israeli&lt;/a&gt; Finance Minster &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABenjamin%20Netanyahu"&gt;Benjamin Netanyahu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has resigned from the cabinet Sunday to protest against the upcoming Israeli withdrawal from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGaza%20Strip"&gt;Gaza Strip&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and part of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Bank"&gt;West Bank&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; according to a ministry spokesman.

Netanyahu submitted a resignation letter to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAriel%20Sharon"&gt;Ariel Sharon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that he said counts as his vote against the pullout plan. He also told reporters, "I understand the ambition to leave Gaza. I can't be part of a move that I believe is wrong, a move that will endanger security and divide the people."

Sharon pushed for the pullout within his highly split &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALikud"&gt;Likud Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which in a recent 17 to 5 vote, approved the evacuation plan. The Israeli Army will assist in evacuation efforts of the first group of settlers in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANetzarim"&gt;Netzarim&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKfar%20Darom"&gt;Kfar Darom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMorag"&gt;Morag&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Sharon named the Vice Prime Minister &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEhud%20Olmert"&gt;Ehud Olmert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as the new finance minister.

The forced evacuations, or "disengagement", of settlers is due to start after August 15. There are nearly 8,500 Jewish residents who live within fortified fences in Gaza. The settlements are surrounded by an Arab Palestinian population of approximately 1.5 million.

In a Sunday news conference, Netanyahu said the current evacuation plan has similarities to the 1993 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOslo%20Accords"&gt;Oslo Accords&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . In that accord, Netanyahu had drawn criticism in his role as Prime Minister for what some say was a failure to adequately insure Israeli security. The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APalestine"&gt;Palestinians&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; gained more autonomy over some parts of the occupied territories in the accords. 

Netanyahu said of the Gaza withdrawal, the Palestinian leadership is again being rewarded without concession.

The resignation is seen as a step by Netanyahu towards challenging Sharon for the leadership of the Likud party once the pullout is over. Netanyahu may have an opportunity to win back the party by placing himself in the national camp.

Netanyahu was one of the most vocal in claiming Saddam was preparing "Weapons of Mass Destruction" and he repeatedly urged America to invade Iraq on that basis.

Humar was on his paramount course mission on the 4700 meter high south rock wall of the 8125 meter high &lt;a href="w%3ANanga%20Parbat"&gt;Nanga Parbat&lt;/a&gt; mountain (the utmost west of the mountain chain) in the &lt;a href="w%3AHimalaya"&gt;Himalaya&lt;/a&gt; mountains, being trapped in the ice-hole at an approximate height of 5900 meters for five days. The rescue mission with the military helicopter is planned for Monday morning local time, August 8, 2005.

The rescue team managed to locate Humar on face on Sunday, but said they need a better helicopter for the actual rescue mission. Swiss Air Zermatt rescue pilots offered their help in the effort.

An investigation into the collapse of the Antarctic Larsen B Ice Shelf has revealed ecosystems previously unknown to the world. These ecosystems have most likely been isolated for about 10,000 years, during which the 600 foot shelf remained stable. Eugene Domack, who led the investigation, believes that methane gas has been fueling life beneath the some 2,800 feet of ice. Domack warns that the collapse of the ice shelf may have disrupted and could possibly destroy the recently-discovered ecosystem.

&lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Jennings"&gt;Peter Jennings&lt;/a&gt;, longtime anchor of ABC's ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20News%20Tonight"&gt;World News Tonight&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ died Sunday in &lt;a href="w%3AManhattan"&gt;Manhattan&lt;/a&gt; after a four month fight with &lt;a href="w%3Alung%20cancer"&gt;lung cancer&lt;/a&gt;. From the anchor desk or from the field, Jennings covered more than 40 years of national and international news including the erection and destruction of the Berlin Wall, the fall of apartheid, the demise of communism in Europe, the millennium, and the September 11 terrorist attacks.

Jennings was honored with numerous awards for journalism, including 16 Emmys, two George Foster Peabody Awards, several Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Awards and several Overseas Press Club Awards. 

Jennings told viewers back in April in a taped message that he had lung cancer and was going to start &lt;a href="w%3Achemotherapy"&gt;chemotherapy&lt;/a&gt; treatment for it. He stated he would continue to host ♡❤World News Tonight♡❤ when it was possible, although he never again appeared on the broadcast. During his absence, &lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Gibson"&gt;Charles Gibson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AElizabeth%20Vargas"&gt;Elizabeth Vargas&lt;/a&gt; filled in for Jennings. It is unknown who will replace Jennings at this time.

Jennings first broadcast experience came at age nine, when he hosted his own radio show for the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation"&gt;Canadian Broadcasting Corporation&lt;/a&gt;. Following many years of reporting from the Middle East, Jennings began appearing on ♡❤World News Tonight♡❤ in 1978, and became its sole anchor in 1983. During the 1980s and early 1990s, the broadcast became the most popular network news program in the US, surpassing the &lt;a href="w%3ACBS%20Evening%20News"&gt;CBS Evening News&lt;/a&gt; in 1986. Jennings followed in his father's footsteps: &lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Jennings"&gt;Charles Jennings&lt;/a&gt; served as Canada's first network news anchorman on the CBC.

A native of Canada, Jennings became a U.S. citizen in 2003. He is survived by his wife, Kayce, his daughter, Elizabeth (25), his son, Christopher (23), and his sister, Sarah.

Soon after he died his wife, &lt;a href="w%3AKayce%20Freed"&gt;Kayce Freed&lt;/a&gt;, issued this statement: "Peter died with his family around him, without pain and in peace. He knew he'd lived a good life."

The &lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20of%20Councillors"&gt;House of Councillors&lt;/a&gt;, the upper house of the &lt;a href="w%3ADiet%20of%20Japan"&gt;Diet of Japan&lt;/a&gt;, voted on the controversial bill that would have privatized the &lt;a href="w%3AJapan%20Post"&gt;Japanese Postal Service&lt;/a&gt; at around 1 p.m. (JST, UTC +8) on Monday, August 8. The bill was rejected by a slim margin – 108 for, 125 against, one abstention and two intentional absences – after a rebellion within the ruling Liberal Democractic Party (LDP).

The Prime Minister, &lt;a href="w%3AJunichiro%20Koizumi"&gt;Junichiro Koizumi&lt;/a&gt;, had promised that the privatization of the Postal Service, which is also Japan's largest savings bank, would "revitalize" the Japanese economy. He has also stated that the commercialization of the Postal Services was at the core of his policies, and threatened to dissolve the houses and call for an immediate election in case of a defeat.

As promised, the rejection led to an immediate call of the cabinet ministers at 3pm to dissolve the &lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20of%20Representatives%20of%20Japan"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;. For the dissolution to be valid all cabinet ministers must jointly sign an edict issued in the name of the Emperor. Cabinet minister Shimamura Yoshinobu, the Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, refused to sign the edict, and resigned. The dissolution was officially announced by Chair Kono at the Diet later in the evening.

The election is reported to be held on September 11.

NASA has postponed the landing of the Space Shuttle ♡❤Discovery♡❤ mission STS-114, planned for today.

Officials initially delayed the landing, but finally cancelled any attempts for today citing the reason as "unstable, unacceptable cloud cover [with the] potential for showers in vicinity of landing site."

Landing the space shuttle craft has been likened to landing a "&lt;a href="w%3ABrick"&gt;brick&lt;/a&gt;". The approach to the landing field is at a steep pitch (nose up) and a high rate of descent. The shuttle is not very maneuverable and has one shot at the correct landing approach. Pilots cannot re-fire the engines to circle around for another approach, which is why low cloud cover is of such concern.

Discovery has spent twelve days in orbit. On Tuesday, there will be six landing opportunities: two each at &lt;a href="w%3AKennedy%20Space%20Center"&gt;Kennedy Space Center&lt;/a&gt; in Florida, &lt;a href="w%3AEdwards%20Air%20Force%20Base"&gt;Edwards Air Force Base&lt;/a&gt; in California, and &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20Sands%20Missile%20Range"&gt;White Sands Space Harbor&lt;/a&gt; in New Mexico. Shuttle managers prefer a landing at Kennedy, but will consider the alternate sites if bad weather in Florida rules out landing there. NASA administrators insist that the shuttle will land tomorrow at one of the three sites, rather than spending yet another day in orbit.

The flight marked the first time a shuttle has been &lt;a href="Crew%20of%20Discovery%20inspect%20Shuttle%20for%20launch%20damage"&gt;inspected in orbit&lt;/a&gt;. The crew made two space walks to effect minor repairs to the Orbiter's thermal protection system as a result.

♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANewsweek"&gt;Newsweek&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ journalist &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Isikoff"&gt;Michael Isikoff&lt;/a&gt; reported that the &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; leak probe into revealing the &lt;a href="CIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; status of &lt;a href="Valerie%20Plame"&gt;Valerie Plame&lt;/a&gt; is likely to soon be under the oversight of one of &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush's&lt;/a&gt; fellow &lt;a href="w%3ASkull%20and%20Bones"&gt;Skull and Bones&lt;/a&gt; members, a man, Isikoff writes, who is an "old friend" of the president.

The investigation by special prosecutor &lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Fitzgerald"&gt;Patrick Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt; into the leak is on a timetable to conclude this October 2005, so the probe is nearing its final stages. Fitzgerald's current boss, Deputy Attorney General &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20B.%20Comey"&gt;James Comey&lt;/a&gt; gave Fitzgerald broad leeway to prosecute the case. Comey is leaving the government post to accept a position as general counsel at &lt;a href="w%3ALockheed%20Martin"&gt;Lockheed Martin&lt;/a&gt;. 

A possible candidate to replace Comey, Associate Attorney General Robert McCallum, was in the Bush 1968 Skull and Bones class, which consisted of 15 Yalesmen. McCallum was in the news headlines in June for his involvement with coming in at the last moment to push through a 90% reduction ($120 Billion) in the penalties requested against big tobacco companies.

In latest developments of the Fitzgerald investigation, &lt;a href="Karl%20Rove"&gt;Karl Rove&lt;/a&gt;'s secretary and Rove's former top aide are being asked why a recorded phone conversation between ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ATIME"&gt;TIME&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reporter &lt;a href="w%3AMatt%20Cooper"&gt;Matt Cooper&lt;/a&gt; and Rove was not available when the call went through the White House switchboard.

How the possible appointment of McCallum to oversee the investigation could affect it, is unknown, and controversial. U.S. Attorney General &lt;a href="Alberto%20Gonzales"&gt;Alberto Gonzales&lt;/a&gt; recused himself from involvement with the investigation.

One of Bush's very first meetings after being installed as President in the &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; was a Skull and Bones reunion. "I joined Skull and Bones, a secret society," Bush wrote in his autobiography, "so secret, I can't say anything more."

&lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; began another round of confidence building talks in the capital today. The focus of the talks is on improving contact and communication between the militaries of the two countries.

The two sides had reached an agreement over the weekend to share information with each other before any ballistic missile tests. Already there is an agreement for the two sides to inform each other before military exercises and violations of air space. There is also talk of upgrading those lines between Director General's Military Operations.

Participants will also review the progress made after the 2003 ceasefire at the borders.

<h1>Space Shuttle Discovery STS-114 landing postponed for weather/Brief</h1>
NASA has cancelled today's planned landing of the Space Shuttle Discovery. Officials initially delayed the landing, but finally cancelled any attempts for today citing the reason as being "unstable, unacceptable cloud cover [with the] potential for showers in vicinity of landing site."

Maj.-Gen. &lt;a href="w%3AAndrew%20Leslie"&gt;Andrew Leslie&lt;/a&gt;, one of Canada's top generals says Canadians should prepare for a long mission to Afghanistan in order to help it break out of "a cycle of warlords and tribalism." Leslie told the audience attending the 74 Annual Couchiching Summer Conference in Orillia, &lt;a href="Ontario"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; on ♡❤The Use of Force Within and Between Nations♡❤ that &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Armed%20Forces"&gt;Canada's troops&lt;/a&gt; will have casualties. As many as 1,250 Canadian soldiers will be serving in Afghanistan by February 2006. A 250-strong &lt;a href="w%3Aprovincial%20reconstruction%20team"&gt;provincial reconstruction team&lt;/a&gt; mission is currently gathering to stabilise the &lt;a href="w%3AKandahar"&gt;Kandahar&lt;/a&gt; region joining the nearly 700 troops already serving in &lt;a href="w%3AKabul"&gt;Kabul&lt;/a&gt;. "Every time you kill an angry young man overseas, you're creating 15 more who will come after you", he said. 

"There are things worth fighting for. There are things worth dying for. There are things worth killing for", Leslie told the conference and he said the end result would be worth the cost:

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=U.N.%20to%20begin%20forming%20response%20to%20Iranian%20nuclear%20program&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A meeting set for Tuesday by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Atomic%20Energy%20Agency"&gt;International Atomic Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (IAEA) could be a move closer to a showdown at the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; over the &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;ian plan to resume uranium conversion at its Isfahan nuclear facility.

Iran on Monday refused the weekend offer by the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; (EU) of economic incentives that included help with nuclear-energy generation. The EU, led by Britain and France, both of which in May 2005 &lt;a href="http%3A//www.un.org/events/npt2005/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were considered to have violated the ♡❤first pillar♡❤ of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty by failing to make serious efforts to dismantle their nuclear bomb stockpiles (preamble and Article VI of the treaty), and Germany, combined the offer with an exchange for Iran to verifiably give up all activities that could lead to a nuclear bomb.

Iranian officials insist their nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, and say it is part of Iran's right to develop nuclear power, as is legally agreed to in the ♡❤third pillar♡❤ of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which gives all states the right to peacefully use nuclear technology. "The proposals are unacceptable," Hossein Moussavian said. "They negate Iran's inalienable right," said the top Iranian nuclear negotiator. 

The Iranian refusal, coming from under the new leadership of &lt;a href="Mahmoud%20Ahmadinejad"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt;, would probably trigger the referral of Iran to the &lt;a href="UN%20Security%20Council"&gt;UN Security Council&lt;/a&gt;.

Iran began uranium conversion shortly after IAEA inspectors installed cameras and other surveillance equipment at their nuclear facility. The facility carried out an early stage of the fuel cycle, which includes turning raw uranium (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ayellowcake"&gt;yellowcake&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) into gas. France and Britain condemned Iran's actions.

The IAEA sealed sensitive equipment at Iran's uranium conversion facility at Isfahan and its uranium enrichment plant at Natanz, as part of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATehran"&gt;Tehran's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; earlier compliance with a Paris agreement. An ♡❤&lt;a href="Al-Jazeera"&gt;Al-Jazeera&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ report said the IAEA seals on the plants' sensitive equipment was recently removed.

In a IAEA statement issued Monday, ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ reports, "It should be noted that the sealed parts of the process line remain intact."

The Associated Press reported today Pope &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AJohn%20Paul%20II"&gt;John Paul II&lt;/a&gt; has been getting nutrition from a tube inserted through his nose. The tube was inserted shortly after the frail pontiff appeared at his window overlooking St. Peter’s Square and could manage only a raspy word or two.

A statement released by the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AVatican%20City"&gt;Vatican&lt;/a&gt; appeared to quash media rumors that the 84-year-old pope might be returning to hospital any time soon. Feeding tubes are a common form of supplemental nutrition for patients who cannot swallow normally.

The type of tube used, a &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Anasogastric%20tube"&gt;nasogastric tube&lt;/a&gt;, is threaded down the nose and throat into the stomach. Other types of tubes are implanted surgically, but this has not been deemed necessary at this stage, according to Dr. Barbara Paris, director of geriatrics at &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AMaimonides%20Medical%20Center"&gt;Maimonides Medical Center&lt;/a&gt; in New York.

She said it could be the step before the more permanent tube is implanted. Although somewhat uncomfortable when inserted, there is no anesthesia required for this procedure.

In this first report issued by the Vatican since March 10, three days before the Pope’s release from hospital, his aides also said John Paul spends "many hours" seated in an armchair, celebrates Mass in his private chapel and has work contacts with his aides "following directly the activities of the Holy See and the life of the church."

The ailing Pope also suffers from &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AParkinson%27s%20disease"&gt;Parkinson's disease&lt;/a&gt;, which makes it difficult for him to talk, and knee and hip ailments that are taking a serious toll on his mobility and follows by only a month the insertion of a breathing tube to help him breathe.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUN"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt;-appointed panel investigating the &lt;a href="w%3Aoil%20for%20food"&gt;oil for food&lt;/a&gt; scandal has released its third report. 

The report says that &lt;a href="w%3ABenon%20Sevan"&gt;Benon Sevan&lt;/a&gt; took nearly US$150,000 in cash bribes. Chef de Cabinet for Kofi Annan, Mark Malloch Brown, said that the UN would lift Sevan's immunity should an approach come from a law enforcement authority and that the UN had been in 'active collaboration' with the Southern District of New York. 

At the press conference responding to the report, Malloch Brown also said that there was will "a real need for serious, deep-rooted management reform of our organization, and that does not seem to be yet fully accepted by all member states."

Benon Sevan, who worked for the UN for nearly 40 years before resigning on Sunday, has denied the accusation. In his resignation letter to Kofi Annan, he wrote: "The charges are false and you, who have known me all these years, should know they are false... I fully understand the pressure you are under..., but sacrificing me for political expediency will never appease our critics or help you or the organisation."

A former UN procurement officer &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Yakovlev"&gt;Alexander Yakovlev&lt;/a&gt; has pleaded guilty to accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes from UN contractors.

The Space Shuttle Discovery STS-114 has been given a 'go' for landing at Edwards Air Force Base today. 

The de-orbit burn is expected at 6:06 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Daylight%20Time"&gt;Central Daylight Time&lt;/a&gt; (CDT) (Mission Control's local time), and landing is expected at 7:12 a.m. CDT. Weather conditions are clear at landing site, with scattered clouds at approximately 20,000 feet, with winds peaking at about 12 knots at the number 22 runway, which is where Discovery has been cleared to land. 

Shuttle Pilot Jim Kelly will be providing the human piloting for the main part of the flight, with Shuttle Commander Eileen Collins taking over most of the piloting duties as Discovery enters the subsonic range.

The US &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20program"&gt;Space Shuttle&lt;/a&gt; Orbiter &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Discovery"&gt;Discovery&lt;/a&gt; has returned to Earth safely, landing at &lt;a href="w%3AEdwards%20Air%20Force%20Base"&gt;Edwards Air Force Base&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, touching down on runway 22 at 8:11:22 am EDT (1211 GMT), and rolling to a stop. 

Commander &lt;a href="w%3AEileen%20Collins"&gt;Eileen Collins&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of her crew on Discovery are going through check-out procedures to secure the vehicle and assure safety. A convoy of specially-designed vehicles have parked near Discovery, ready to assist in debarkation of the &lt;a href="w%3AAstronaut"&gt;astronaut&lt;/a&gt;s from on-board the shuttle, and other initial post-flight processing of the orbiter.

The astronauts on board Discovery (Orbital Vehicle 103 (OV-103)) are expected to disembark at approximately 9 am EDT.

A press conference has been scheduled for 8:30 am CDT, including Dr. &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Griffin"&gt;Michael Griffin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; Administrator, among others. NASA-TV will be providing live coverage, among others.

On a ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ &lt;a href="w%3AWolf%20Blitzer"&gt;Wolf Blitzer&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤Late Edition♡❤ broadcast Sunday, U.S. Senators &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Allen%20%28politician%29"&gt;George Allen&lt;/a&gt; (R-&lt;a href="w%3AVirginia"&gt;VA&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href="w%3ABarbara%20Boxer"&gt;Barbara Boxer&lt;/a&gt; (D-&lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;CA&lt;/a&gt;) both told Blitzer that in the furore created by the protest that they believe President Bush should personally meet with &lt;a href="w%3ACindy%20Sheehan"&gt;Cindy Sheehan&lt;/a&gt;. She is the mother of a soldier son killed in Iraq in April 2004, and leader of a protest march now camped near the presidential ranch in &lt;a href="w%3ACrawford%2C%20Texas"&gt;Crawford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATexas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;.

After returning from commercial break, Blitzer told his guests that ♡❤CNN♡❤ had just received a news bulletin from the &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;. The bulletin said that Bush had met previously with Sheehan in the summer of 2004. Both Senators and Blitzer withheld further comment on the matter during the remaining segment of the show.

Later that day, Cindy Sheehan herself appeared on ♡❤CNN♡❤ Sunday with Blitzer and said she did meet with Bush in Seattle with fifteen or sixteen other families.

She defended her current protest by saying, "The whole meeting was simply bizarre and disgusting."

Sheehan said that Bush entered the meeting chamber with an insensitive comment to those present, "Who we'all honorin' today?" She added, "His mouth kept moving, but there was nothing in his eyes or anything else about him that showed me he really cared or had any real compassion at all. This is a human being totally disconnected from humanity and reality. His eyes were empty, hollow shells." 

The angry mother of the fallen &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; soldier on Saturday led a protest march of nearly 50 on the &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush&lt;/a&gt; ranch. Cindy Sheehan of &lt;a href="w%3AVacaville%2C%20California"&gt;Vacaville&lt;/a&gt;, California demanded, but was denied, the chance to speak with Bush and personally ask him, "'Why did you kill my son? What did my son die for?"

Sheehan was met outside the ranch, after progress of the march was stopped by Texas troopers and the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Secret%20Service"&gt;Secret Service&lt;/a&gt;, by national security adviser &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Hadley"&gt;Steve Hadley&lt;/a&gt; and deputy White House chief of staff Joe Hagin. They spoke with her approximately 45 minutes.

Sheehan, unsatisfied with the meeting, vowed to remain camped outside the ranch until she is granted a personal interview with Bush. Meanwhile, Bush arrived in &lt;a href="w%3AAlbuqerque%2C%20New%20Mexico"&gt;Albuqerque&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Mexico"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt; Monday where he signed into law the new energy bill. He will travel back to his Texas ranch this week to meet with his defense and economic advisers, then later, he will travel to &lt;a href="w%3AIllinois"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt; to sign a highway bill.

Cindy Sheehan said Sunday that she plans to hold the roadside peace protest near Bush's ranch until he talks to her again. "I'll follow him to D.C.," she said.

Cindy's current comments are a drastic change from her comments in a 2004 interview with THE REPORTER of Vacaville, CA. From the article:

"I now know he's sincere about wanting freedom for the Iraqis," Cindy said after their meeting. "I know he's sorry and feels some pain for our loss. And I know he's a man of faith."

<h1>Anti-gay church protests U.S. at military funerals</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Anti-gay%20church%20protests%20U.S.%20at%20military%20funerals&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

U.S. veterans groups and &lt;a href="w%3AMidwest"&gt;Midwest&lt;/a&gt; politicians are angered by the anti-gay &lt;a href="w%3AWestboro%20Baptist%20Church"&gt;Westboro Baptist Church&lt;/a&gt;'s recent practice of protesting at the funerals of U.S. soldiers killed in the &lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20War"&gt;Iraq War&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3ATopeka%2C%20Kansas"&gt;Topeka, Kansas&lt;/a&gt;-based church led by &lt;a href="w%3AFred%20Phelps"&gt;Fred Phelps&lt;/a&gt; sent 6 protestors with picket signs to the memorial service of 49 &lt;a href="w%3AOhio"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt; servicemen killed in Iraq. They were members of the Third Battalion, 25th Marine Regiment of &lt;a href="w%3ABrook%20Park%2C%20Ohio"&gt;Brook Park, Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, a suburb of &lt;a href="w%3ACleveland%2C%20Ohio"&gt;Cleveland&lt;/a&gt;. 

Last week at the August 5 funeral of Army Specialist Adam Harding in the &lt;a href="w%3AChicago"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt; suburb of &lt;a href="w%3APortage%2C%20Indiana"&gt;Portage, Indiana&lt;/a&gt;, the Westboro church sent ten protesters. Harding died in Iraq July 25 when the convoy he was in hit a roadside bomb.

According to reports, the picket signs at the funeral carried such messages as, "Thank God for 9/11," "God is U.S.A.’s Terrorist," "God hates you," "Thank God for dead soldiers" and "America is Doomed." Despite the tone of the messages, church members say they are not protesting against the Iraq War, but against &lt;a href="w%3Ahomosexuality"&gt;homosexuality&lt;/a&gt;. Neither Harding nor any of the 49 Ohio servicemen killed are reported to have been homosexual.

In Ohio, many of the funeral attendees cursed the protesters, according to a report in the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20Times"&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

A report from the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AChicago%20Tribune"&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ said Westboro church spokeswoman Shirley Phelps-Roper said the church is delivering the church's message that it believes America is doomed and that they single out military funerals because soldiers, like all Americans, are being taught to accept homosexual behavior and other acts it calls sinful.

"This nation has angered the Lord their God and the wrath of god is pouring out on them. God is dealing with this nation, and you can't do one thing to stop it or stop him from blowing those young people to pieces," Phelps Roper said in an interview with CBS affiliate WBBM-TV in Chicago.

Church members say they are expressing their &lt;a href="w%3AFirst%20Amendment"&gt;First Amendment&lt;/a&gt; rights to protest as they see fit.

But Chicago-area veterans associations held a press conference Monday denouncing the funeral protesters. "Those who are protecting our nation provide the fundamental right of the First Amendment. But to protest at funerals is wrong," Chicago Alderman &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Balcer"&gt;James Balcer&lt;/a&gt;, a veteran of the &lt;a href="w%3AVietnam%20War"&gt;Vietnam War&lt;/a&gt;, reportedly said.

Balcer said the Westboro church should apologize to veterans for its actions.

In a televised &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Defense"&gt;Pentagon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; press briefing Tuesday, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Secretary of Defense &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADonald%20Rumsfeld"&gt;Donald Rumsfeld&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; stood by a press release from the Pentagon on Monday that reported explosives and bombs crossed into &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from across the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iranian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; border. A weapons cache was said to have been intercepted. "It is true that weapons, clearly, unambiguously from Iran have been found in Iraq," Rumsfeld said today.

Evidence reportedly indicated the quality and sophistication of the weapons was such that they may have been manufactured in Iran, but Rumsfeld was unable or unwilling to describe the weapons further. Timing of the Pentagon release coincides with the controversy over Iran restarting its nuclear facilities.

Rumsfeld, with the Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staffs, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Myers"&gt;Richard Myers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , said the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJihad"&gt;jihadist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; effort in Iraq was aimed at inciting civil war, since they realize they cannot directly defeat the coalition. Speaking on the issue of border crossings of troops and munitions from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASyria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and Iran, Rumsfeld implied that those nations don't want progress in to be made in Iraq. He said, "... what are the Iranians doing? Are they going to be helpful or unhelpful? ... same with the Syrians... are they being helpful or unhelpful?" 

The two cited progress by the Iraqi government in working toward the August 15 deadline for drafting a new constitution. In a nod to the possibility that the deadline will be missed, it was said that the constitution could be amended, and that voting on ratification would occur in October of this year, with a general election to follow in December. Myers referred to a shift in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASunni"&gt;Sunni&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; participation in the process, saying, "All indications are that the Sunni leadership in Iraq has made a fundamental decision that they want to be part of the process." 

They reasserted previous &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; statements that there is no clear time-table for an Iraqi withdrawal because it depends on the situation at the time. "The drawdowns that will occur eventually will obviously be based on those conditions." Rumsfeld said. Further questions by reporters intending to pin down a clear withdrawal time-line were rebuffed.

Myers said, "You have economic progress that has to be made; you have political progress that has to be made." He added that "173,000 Iraqi security forces" are in place in the country, but along with work on the country's infrastructure, much remains to be done with the training and equipping of their security forces.

Explorers have just released information on the discovery and exploration of a new entrance to &lt;a href="w%3AKentucky"&gt;Kentucky's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMammoth%20Cave"&gt;Mammoth Cave&lt;/a&gt;. Located in the east central &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, the 579-kilometer-long (360 mile) &lt;a href="w%3Acave"&gt;cave&lt;/a&gt; is the longest known in the world. Despite its length and a 200 year exploration effort, only eight natural entrances have been located into the vast underground system.

The entrance was discovered in September 2003, and a route to known sections of Mammoth Cave was first discovered in March. The actual connection was made at 11:55 p.m. Central Standard Time, March 18, 2005 (4:55 UTC, March 19, 2005) by veteran cavers Alan Canon, John Feil, Dick Market, and James Wells. The latest mapping adds four kilometers (2.5 miles) to Mammoth Cave's total length.

Alan Glennon, a cave scientist at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20California%2C%20Santa%20Barbara"&gt;University of California, Santa Barbara&lt;/a&gt;, describes the find as "exciting". "Such significant discoveries show that we've still got a lot to learn about places right under our feet", he said. 

Exploration of Mammoth Cave is conducted by the &lt;a href="w%3ACave%20Research%20Foundation"&gt;Cave Research Foundation&lt;/a&gt; and Central Kentucky Karst Coalition. Both groups' membership is open to experienced cave surveyors. The explorers note that the new entrance is located far from the developed, tourist trails within &lt;a href="w%3AMammoth%20Cave%20National%20Park"&gt;Mammoth Cave National Park&lt;/a&gt;.

Mammoth Cave is located at &lt;a href="http%3A//maps.google.com/maps%3Fq%3D37.186%2B-86.100%26amp%3Bll%3D37.190955%2C-86.149979%26amp%3Bspn%3D0.123936%2C0.324200%26amp%3Bhl%3Den"&gt;37.186° N 86.100° W&lt;/a&gt;.

The province of &lt;a href="w%3AAlberta"&gt;Alberta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; is considering legal action against &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20National%20Railway"&gt;Canadian National Railway&lt;/a&gt; for failing to warn that a derailment last week contaminated &lt;a href="w%3AWabamun%20Lake"&gt;Wabamun Lake&lt;/a&gt; with a hazardous chemical.

The 700,000 &lt;a href="w%3Alitre"&gt;litre&lt;/a&gt;s of heavy Bunker C &lt;a href="w%3Afuel%20oil"&gt;fuel oil&lt;/a&gt; that spilled into the lake asphyxiated birds and killed fish.

In addition, one of the ruptured tanker cars sent 70,000 liters of Imperial Pole Treating Oil into the lake. This oil is a yellow mixture of &lt;a href="w%3Apolycyclic%20aromatic%20hydrocarbon"&gt;polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href="w%3Aaliphatic%20hydrocarbon"&gt;aliphatic hydrocarbon&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href="w%3ANaphthalene"&gt;Naphthalene&lt;/a&gt;, a component of this "very toxic material" is suspected of causing &lt;a href="w%3Askin%20cancer"&gt;skin cancer&lt;/a&gt; if touched and &lt;a href="w%3Alung%20cancer"&gt;lung&lt;/a&gt; or other cancers if inhaled. Inhalation is promoted by actions that cause splashing or foaming. The mineral oil is used in connection with &lt;a href="w%3Apentachlorophenol"&gt;pentachlorophenol&lt;/a&gt; for preserving wooden utility poles.

Wabamun Lake is a popular summertime recreational area about 65 kilometers (40 miles) west of &lt;a href="w%3AEdmonton"&gt;Edmonton&lt;/a&gt;, Alberta.

The 766-megawatt Keephills power generating plant, one of 3 in Wabamun, was shut down because the coal-fired plant uses water from the lake. Edmonton's health authority ordered people not to swim, boat or rescue animals in the lake and to stop using its water or any water from nearby wells for cooking, drinking, showering or brushing teeth. These warnings came 3 days after many residents, including children, had been wading into the oil slick without protective clothing to save wildlife injured by the spill and others had been routinely depending on the lakewater for home use. Why the alert was not issued sooner remains under investigation and may result in criminal charges. Canadian National Railway had been informed of the nature of the oil when it was loaded by &lt;a href="w%3AImperial%20Oil"&gt;Imperial Oil Ltd&lt;/a&gt;., Canada's largest petroleum company. Imperial Oil is posting informational updates on a special website &lt;a href="http%3A//www.cn.ca/about/media/en_index.shtml"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In addition The Wabamun Residents Committee has established an information website &lt;a href="http%3A//www.wabamunwatch.com"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

All residents within a half-mile radius of the EQ Resource Recovery chemical plant in southeastern &lt;a href="w%3AMichigan"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt; were asked to voluntarily evacuate on Tuesday due to a chemical plant explosion. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.clickondetroit.com"&gt;ClickOnDetroit&lt;/a&gt; reported that nearby residents who choose to stay were told to close their doors and windows.

The plant, located in &lt;a href="w%3ARomulus%2C%20Michigan"&gt;Romulus&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href="w%3AWayne%2C%20Michigan"&gt;Wayne&lt;/a&gt;, is about 15 miles southwest of &lt;a href="w%3ADetroit%2C%20Michigan"&gt;Detroit&lt;/a&gt;. Initial reports stated that a single explosion in a chemical tank was the cause of the fire. The cause of this explosion has not yet been determined. Detroit &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Broadcast%20Company"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt; affiliate WXYZ confirmed that all employees made it out of the plant before the explosion occurred, and that &lt;a href="w%3AHAZMAT"&gt;HAZMAT&lt;/a&gt; teams were on the scene of the fire. &lt;a href="w%3AWayne%20County%2C%20Michigan"&gt;Wayne County&lt;/a&gt; Sheriff Warren Evans announced that no injuries were reported in the initial explosion. However, approximately 32 people were treated for breathing problems at nearby Oakwood Annapolis Hospital, due to the subsequent fire. 

The Environmental Protection Agency (&lt;a href="w%3AEPA"&gt;EPA&lt;/a&gt;) analyzed soot in the area and determined that it did not pose a substantial health risk. The company in question has been the target of numerous enforcement actions by the EPA in the past, including a $240,000 fine in 1999. A major chemical processed at the plant is &lt;a href="w%3Aacetone"&gt;acetone&lt;/a&gt;, the main ingredient in nail polish remover, which is known to be toxic in high dosages, especially to those with lung conditions. Acetone is also an eye and skin irritant. Other chemicals, such as &lt;a href="w%3Aantifreeze%20%28coolant%29"&gt;antifreeze&lt;/a&gt;, are also processed there. Two Detroit-area law firms have filed class action lawsuits against EQ Resource Recovery on behalf of local residents, and a third is considering similar action.

Romulus is the site of the Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport (&lt;a href="w%3ADTW"&gt;DTW&lt;/a&gt;), the primary airport for the Detroit area and a hub for &lt;a href="w%3ANorthwest%20Airlines"&gt;Northwest Airlines&lt;/a&gt;. However, airport service was not affected. News of this explosion came as a chemical plant explosion in &lt;a href="w%3AStory%20City%2C%20Iowa"&gt;Story City, Iowa&lt;/a&gt; happened just a day before and three similar explosions in &lt;a href="w%3ATexas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; occurred July 28.

The EQ Resource Recovery Inc. and EQ Holding Company chemical processing plant near &lt;a href="w%3ARomulus%2C%20Michigan"&gt;Romulus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Michigan"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, about 15 miles southwest of &lt;a href="w%3ADetroit%2C%20Michigan"&gt;Detroit&lt;/a&gt;, was the scene of explosions and fire on Tuesday evening, continuing into Wednesday. The cause of the explosions and fire has not yet been determined. 

Firefighters announced their intention to let the fire burn itself out, which was estimated will take approximately 8 hours. However, parts of the fire continued to burn as of Wednesday evening. There were evacuations of approximately 3000 residents from the area, but no reports of any serious injuries or fatalities. However, approximately 20 people were treated for breathing problems at nearby Oakwood Annapolis Hospital.

The volcano on &lt;a href="w%3AHeard%20Island%20and%20McDonald%20Islands"&gt;McDonald Island&lt;/a&gt;, approximately 4,000 kilometres south-west of &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20Australia"&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt;, is erupting for the first time since 2001. &lt;a href="w%3AMagma"&gt;Magma&lt;/a&gt; is described as slowly "oozing" out of the volcano by Professor Michael Stoddart, chief scientist with the Australian Antarctic program, creating new land suitable for colonisation by local wildlife. The volcano is one of Australia's two active volcanos.

Senator &lt;a href="w%3AIan%20Campbell%20%28Australian%20politician%29"&gt;Ian Campbell&lt;/a&gt; unveiled satellite images of the island today at the opening of the annual &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Antarctic%20Division"&gt;Australian Antarctic Division&lt;/a&gt; exhibition at Parliament House. 

The small island group is rocky from its volcanic geological origins, and uninhabited. The recent activity on tiny McDonald Island caused it to almost double in size.

Fourteen people are presumed dead after a passenger helicopter of the &lt;a href="w%3AFinland"&gt;Finnish&lt;/a&gt; company &lt;a href="w%3ACopterline"&gt;Copterline&lt;/a&gt; crashed into the &lt;a href="w%3ABaltic%20Sea"&gt;Baltic Sea&lt;/a&gt;, 5 km off the coast of &lt;a href="w%3AEstonia"&gt;Estonia&lt;/a&gt;.

After hours of search, the wreck was found with a sonar at a depth of approximately 60 meters. The cabin is damaged but has remained in one piece, and passengers were found dead inside the cabin. Lifting of the wreckage is being planned at the moment.

The &lt;a href="w%3ASikorsky%20S-76"&gt;Sikorsky S-76&lt;/a&gt; was on a scheduled passenger flight to &lt;a href="w%3AHelsinki"&gt;Helsinki&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3ATallinn"&gt;Tallinn&lt;/a&gt;, the Estonian capital. The craft came down just three minutes after take-off at 12:43 pm (GMT+3). According to an eyewitness, two loud bangs were heard before the craft crashed down. No smoke or fire were seen after the bangs.

On board were six Finnish, four Estonian and two American passengers as well as two Finnish crew members.
Both of the pilots were experienced, with over 10 years of flight experience in the company.

Estonian rescue helicopters and boats have been sent, a Finnish rescue helicopter and mini submarines also at the scene.

Investigation of the causes of the accident is underway, but one possible reason is the bad weather as the area has been suffering from severe storms recently, the winds at the time are believed to have been 17-20 metres a second. "Many of the helicopters safety measures failed", said the spokesman from Copterline. The safety measures include the ability of the craft to glide down in case of engine failure and the ability to float on water, both of which seemed to have failed. Copterline, one of the largest helicopter airlines in Europe, has cancelled all upcoming flights today, but are continuing as scheduled tomorrow morning.

Early Wednesday morning (5:30 am local time), the military helicopter Lama III rescued alpinist &lt;a href="w%3AToma%C5%BE%20Humar"&gt;Tomaž Humar&lt;/a&gt;, who went up on a solo climb on one of the highest peaks in the Himalayas.

Humar became trapped by a bad weather and avalanches in a ice-cave on 5 August at an approximate height of 5900 meters with no food left for the last few days. After Mr. Humar was back in the base-camp, the mission medic Dr. Anda Perdan said he has some very beginning of chilblains on his toes, but she expects there will be no serious consequences. By one of the news-sites &lt;a href="http%3A//24ur.com/naslovnica/nangaparbat/20050810_2060123.php%3FArf%3D2i2"&gt;24ur.com - Srečen, na trdnih tleh&lt;/a&gt;, he decided to stay in the base-camp after the rescue mission (and not being taken to the hospital), however, by the , he has been later taken to a hospital located in the mountain town of Gilgit.

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; has lost another battle in the ongoing &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.-Canada%20softwood%20lumber%20dispute"&gt;U.S.-Canada softwood lumber dispute&lt;/a&gt;.

A &lt;a href="w%3ANAFTA"&gt;NAFTA&lt;/a&gt; Extraordinary Challenge Committee (ECC) rejected U.S. allegations that an earlier ruling in support of &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;'s position violated NAFTA rules. 

This is the latest of a string of failed U.S. attempts, to show before &lt;a href="w%3ANAFTA"&gt;NAFTA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AWTO"&gt;WTO&lt;/a&gt; tribunals, that the Canadian government has been subsidizing lumber. On several occasions, the U.S. has been told that its calculating methods were not valid. A NAFTA report of August 13, 2003 said the U.S. made a mistake in calculating its duties based on U.S. prices, and by not taking Canadian market conditions into consideration, and ordered Washington to recalculate them. NAFTA decisions are legally binding and must be put into effect within 60 days. 

Two weeks later, a WTO panel concluded that the U.S. wrongly applied harsh &lt;a href="w%3Aduties%23Economics"&gt;duties&lt;/a&gt; on Canadian softwood exports. They also found that provincial &lt;a href="w%3Astumpage"&gt;stumpage&lt;/a&gt; programs provide a "financial benefit" to Canadian producers. However, the panel made it clear that the benefit was not enough to constitute a subsidy, and did not justify the U.S. duties.

"We are extremely pleased that the ECC dismissed the claims of the United States," said Canada's International Trade Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Peterson"&gt;Jim Peterson&lt;/a&gt;. 

"This is a binding decision that clearly eliminates the basis for U.S.-imposed duties on Canadian softwood lumber. We fully expect the United States to abide by this ruling, stop collecting duties and refund the duties collected over the past three years," he said. 

Negotiations between Canada and the U.S. are expected to resume next week.

While there have been suggestions that the ruling could bring the softwood dispute to an end after more than four years, the issue may not be resolved. The United States could still file legal challenges outside of NAFTA. 

The United States has been collecting duties on Canadian softwood lumber since May 2002, after American lumber producers accused Ottawa of subsidizing lumber exports.

<h1>Greenpeace tries to thwart Chesapeake Bay fishing fleet</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Greenpeace%20tries%20to%20thwart%20Chesapeake%20Bay%20fishing%20fleet&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="Greenpeace"&gt;Greenpeace&lt;/a&gt; activists scattered schools of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Amenhaden"&gt;menhaden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Abait%20fish"&gt;bait fish&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChesapeake%20Bay"&gt;Chesapeake Bay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on Tuesday when fishing ships belonging to Omega Protein Corp. were about to drop their sceine nets.
The Omega fleet consisted of two spotter planes and four fishing boats with eight &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AShip%27s%20tender"&gt;tenders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Greenpeace arrived with four fast moving out-board motor boats, manned by thirteen activists, who attempted to drive away the fish. The Coast Guard was called in and ended the confrontation peacefully.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHouston%2C%20Texas"&gt;Houston&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -based Omega Protein Corporation is the largest processor and distributor of protein-rich menhaden and fish oil products in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. The company accounts for nearly 90% of the entire East Coast menhaden catch.

An Omega spokesman Toby Gascon said of Greenpeace, "They have now demonstrated that their real agenda is to put Omega out of business, even if it means risking the safety of Omega's fishermen." Their fleet is out of Reedville, &lt;a href="Virginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, now a top U.S. fishing port due to the recent Omega processing plant opened there.

Chesapeake Bay menhaden are considered an important food source for fish species popular with sports fisherman. They are also, next to oysters, a prime &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Afilter%20feeder"&gt;filter feeder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in bay waters. The bay oyster population has suffered drastic declines from disease over the last two decades. Studies of menhaden populations are still inconclusive as scientists try to determine the overall number of bay menhaden.
Greenpeace says the species is near historic lows and predators that depend on the fish as a food source, such as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Astriped%20bass"&gt;striped bass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , show signs of suffering from malnutrition and poor body condition. 

The ♡❤Chesapeake Bay Foundation♡❤, a not-for-profit organization, had praise for &lt;a href="Maryland"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt; Governor &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20L.%20Ehrlich"&gt;Robert Ehrlich&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and the state's Department of Natural Resources. They secured a commitment from the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC) to seek a cap on commercial harvesting of Atlantic Menhaden. 

A coalition of recreational anglers and environmentalists, called ♡❤Menhaden Matter♡❤, also joined the debate by saying coast-wide population of Atlantic Menhaden has fallen to near record lows. They are also against an encroachment by Omega into Chesapeake waters.

The issue is a cap proposed by ASMFC on the menhaden harvest. The Board recommended a Draft Addendum to limit the menhaden harvest to 110,400 metric tons, which is the average over five years of consecutive declines in harvests for the species. The limit would apply to Atlantic and in-land waters of the species. The proposed cap is for years 2006 and 2007 and open to public debate.

ASMFC recently rejected an offer by Omega that would voluntarily cap their harvest at 135,000 metric tons annually for the next four years. They noted Omega also seeks to reopen some waters in Maryland and &lt;a href="New%20Jersey"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; which are currently closed to industrial purse seine operations. A public hearing is scheduled in &lt;a href="Alexandria%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Alexandria&lt;/a&gt;, Virginia in the next few days.

Omega says that ASMFC's own reports indicate the population levels of Atlantic menhaden are healthy.

A ♡❤Chesapeake Bay Foundation♡❤ senior scientist, William J. Goldsborough, said, "I believe that a cap on the purse seine catch of menhaden at current levels, covering the total catch as well as removals from Chesapeake Bay, would be a prudent measure to adopt."

A week-long choking &lt;a href="w%3Asmog"&gt;smog-like haze&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;a href="w%3AMalaysia"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt; has prompted crisis talks with &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;. Lingering smoke from forest fires on the &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesian&lt;/a&gt; island of &lt;a href="w%3ASumatra"&gt;Sumatra&lt;/a&gt; are the primary cause. Farmers regularly burn scrub and forest to clear land during the dry season, but this is the worst haze since 1997.

Air quality in the Malaysian capital city of &lt;a href="w%3AKuala%20Lumpur"&gt;Kuala Lumpur&lt;/a&gt; is so poor, health officials are advising citizens to stay at home with doors closed. Some schools have been closed to keep children from being exposed to the haze. Schools that chose to remain open are keeping children indoors and require them to wear protective masks when they are forced to venture outdoors.

&lt;a href="w%3AKuala%20Lumpur%20International%20Airport"&gt;Kuala Lumpur International Airport&lt;/a&gt; was unaffected but smaller flights from Subang airport were suspended.

Malaysia's Environment Minister, &lt;a href="w%3AAdenan%20Satem"&gt;Adenan Satem&lt;/a&gt;, and Commodities Minister, &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Chin%20%28minister%29"&gt;Peter Chin&lt;/a&gt;, will meet with Indonesia's forestry minister and officials from its environment ministry in Medan, according to Malaysian media. Malaysia has offered to send firefighters to fight the forest and scrub fires estimated at numbering more than 300.

On Thursday, &lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; successfully tested their first &lt;a href="w%3Acruise%20missile"&gt;cruise missile&lt;/a&gt;, becoming the only country to test cruise missiles in the region.

The missile is named &lt;a href="w%3ABabur"&gt;Babur&lt;/a&gt;, it can carry either a &lt;a href="w%3Anuclear"&gt;nuclear&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="w%3Aconventional%20warhead"&gt;conventional warhead&lt;/a&gt;.

According to the military, the missile is a "terrain hugging" missile designed to evade radar. It flies parallel to the ground and has an advanced navigation and guidance system.

At a hackers conference in Las Vegas with the spoofed name of &lt;a href="w%3ADEFCON"&gt;Defcon&lt;/a&gt;, the Assistant Secretary of Defense &lt;a href="w%3ALinton%20Wells"&gt;Linton Wells&lt;/a&gt; made a pitch to attendees; "If you want to work on cutting-edge problems, if you want to be part of the truly great issues of our time ... we invite you to work with us."

Technology commentator Richard Thieme said that there are many Feds attending undercover; "You can't be deceived by the uniforms. I talked at the Pentagon, and one-third of the people in the audience I already knew from Defcon." Attendees who "out" the undercover ops are awarded free "T" shirts.

A "Meet the Feds" panel was attended by a man who demanded, "I would like to know why the federal government, especially some of the law enforcement agencies, are destroying this country."

Pentagon people would not comment on the rumours that they are looking for people to attack "foreign" networks. "I'm learning while I'm here but I'm also getting the names of people." said Don Blumenthal of the &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Trade%20Commission"&gt;Federal Trade Commission&lt;/a&gt;.

The Feds arrested a Russian programmer &lt;a href="w%3ADmitry%20Sklyarov"&gt;Dmitry Sklyarov&lt;/a&gt; at the annual 2001 Defcon conference. The gathering is attended by computer security experts, hackers and crackers of all types who celebrate the cutting edge of the technology.

A truck carrying 35,500 pounds (16,100 kg) of &lt;a href="w%3Aexplosives"&gt;explosives&lt;/a&gt; used in mining and seismic exploration overturned and exploded on a rural mountain section of &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Highway%206"&gt;U.S. Highway 6&lt;/a&gt; in Utah's Spanish Fork Canyon Thursday afternoon.

The wreck occurred shortly after 2 pm, as driver Travis Stewart, 30, of Rexburg, Idaho, was leaving Ensign-Bickford Co., a commercial explosives manufacturing plant at the mouth of the canyon. Company officials said the truck was destined for Oklahoma. 

Witnesses said Mr. Stewart appeared to lose control of the truck after entering a curve in the road at a high rate of speed. Utah Highway Patrol Lt. Ken Peay said, "speed was a factor" in the wreck of the truck but refused to speculate on how fast the truck was traveling when it wrecked. Lt. Peay said the posted speed limit on the road is 60 mph, but the advised speed is 40.

At least 17 people received minor injuries and the explosion left a 35 foot deep crater in the highway. The driver was transported via helicopter to a hospital, where he was listed in fair condition, and was later released. The co-driver Troy Lysfjord, 37, of Blackfoot, Idaho, was helped from the wreck by passers by and listed in fair condition at Utah Valley Regional Hospital in Provo.

The wreck site occurred on a major thoroughfare between &lt;a href="w%3ADenver"&gt;Denver&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASalt%20Lake%20City"&gt;Salt Lake City&lt;/a&gt; - about 60 miles south of Salt Lake City - was already under reconstruction by nightfall, as road crews began installing 10 inches of asphalt on the two lane road. 

Utah Department of Transportation spokesman Tom Hudachko said officials hoped to have the road fully repaired by Friday afternoon, adding that, "When you take a look at that hole that was there 24 hours ago, I think it's amazing the progress that was made." As of press time, the mouth of the canyon was reopened to traffic, while traffic at the accident site was impassible, and rerouted nearby. 

The explosion consumed all but about 60 pounds of explosives, and loosened some boulders on the north side of the highway, damaged railroad tracks and some fiber optic lines buried along the roadway. Amtrak and Union Pacific reported delays resulting from the wreck. Uinta National Forest spokesman Loyal Clark said forest firefighters were unable to respond to several small fires nearby that were apparently started by flying debris, and that helicopters dropped water to extinguish them. High humidity and lack of fuel from a previous fire delayed the fire's spread.

The cost of repairs, while paid immediately by the state, will ultimately be borne by the trucking company's insurance carrier. The truck is registered to R&amp;R Trucking of Duenweg, Missouri. 

UHP Lt. Peay said the investigation findings will be turned over to Utah County Attorney Kay Bryson whom would make any final decision about what charges, if any, would be pressed.

A new song by the British rock band &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Rolling%20Stones"&gt;The Rolling Stones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; titled "Sweet Neo Con" has been stirring a controversy over its lyrics, which are highly critical of the &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush administration&lt;/a&gt;.

"You call yourself a Christian, I call you a hypocrite" is among the verses in "Sweet Neo Con", according to the Magazine ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANewsweek"&gt;Newsweek&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤. Lead singer &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMick%20Jagger"&gt;Mick Jagger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; commented on the song, saying "It is certainly very critical of certain policies of the administration, but so what! Lots of people are critical." Jagger, however, denies the criticism is directed at Bush.

The song is scheduled for release September 5 on a CD entitled "A Bigger Bang". Jagger told music critic Jude Cole of ♡❤ExtraTV♡❤, "You can't make rock records without a lot of vitality." 

The band is scheduled to start a tour in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, starting in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABoston%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on August 21.

Tropical Storm Irene will increase in strength over the next several days, possibly developing into a hurricane that will hit the east coast of the United States, said the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Hurricane%20Center"&gt;National Hurricane Center&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AMiami"&gt;Miami, Florida&lt;/a&gt; in a report today.

Irene was located approximately 975 kilometers south-southeast of Bermuda at 16:00 UTC today. Forecasters say that the storm is now moving in a west-northwest direction with top sustained winds of 40 miles per hour.

Commenting on Irene's potential impact on the United States, James Franklin of the National Hurricane Center said, "It certainly doesn't look like the main threat is Florida, but stranger things have happened. ... It may well turn sharply enough (to the north) to not make landfall."

Irene is the ninth named storm in this year's Atlantic hurricane season. The average number of storms named by this point in the season is only two.

&lt;a href="w%3A%20Baltimore%20Orioles"&gt;Baltimore Orioles&lt;/a&gt; baseball fans had a chance to vote for their support of &lt;a href="w%3AMajor%20League%20Baseball"&gt;Major League Baseball's&lt;/a&gt; (MLB) &lt;a href="w%3A%20Anabolic%20steroid"&gt;steroid use&lt;/a&gt; and policies with their home game attendance Thursday night. &lt;a href="w%3ARafael%20Palmeiro"&gt;Rafael Palmeiro&lt;/a&gt;, back after serving a 10-game suspension for testing positive for &lt;a href="w%3A%20Stanozolol"&gt;stanozolol&lt;/a&gt;, was notably not in the starting line-up against the visiting &lt;a href="w%3A%20Tampa%20Bay%20Devil%20Rays"&gt;Tampa Bay Devil Rays&lt;/a&gt;. Attendance was on the thin side, around 27,000 attended at the 48,262 capacity stadium at &lt;a href="w%3AOriole%20Park%20at%20Camden%20Yards"&gt;Camden Yards&lt;/a&gt;.

The Orioles concluded a 3-game sweep of the Rays with tonight's 4-2 win. Rafael Palmeiro watched from the dugout.

Palmeiro, this season's embattled &lt;a href="w%3A%20designated%20hitter"&gt;designated hitter&lt;/a&gt; and sometimes &lt;a href="w%3A%20First%20baseman"&gt;first baseman&lt;/a&gt;, is an Orioles star who in March made finger wagging and emphatic denials of steroid use during his testimony before the &lt;a href="w%3A%20U.S.%20House%20Committee%20on%20Government%20Reform"&gt;House Committee on Government Reform&lt;/a&gt;. It was later learned that MLB officials had evidence of his drug use prior to the Palmeiro testimony, but none of that was known until the scandalous aftermath caused by their August 1 suspension of him.

Palmeiro responded to the suspension at a news conference that followed by saying he had no idea how traces of the steroid could be found in his urine, and that somehow he was an unwitting victim. The potent and easily detected steroid is almost always injected with a needle. 

The House committee chairman, Tom Davis (&lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3AVirginia"&gt;VA&lt;/a&gt;), said Palmeiro voluntarily turned over documents that are being reviewed during their stepped up perjury investigation. MLB said they would turn over their documents today.

The prospects currently look dim for a Palmeiro nomination to baseball's &lt;a href="w%3A%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame"&gt;Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt;. Previously, he was virtually assured a place.

In a short meeting with ballpark press reporters before the game, Palmeiro, who earlier insisted he would not talk to the press said, "It's been a tough time for me and my family over the last couple of weeks, and at this time, I've been instructed by my attorneys not to comment on the situation. The time will come soon, hopefully, that I can explain my situation." 

A local sportswriter David Steele called on fans to stay home and hit the sport in its money pockets. "Wondering what to do tonight, the official end of Palmeiro's insultingly brief punishment, when he suits up again at Camden Yards? Try this: stay home."

Methane is a &lt;a href="w%3AGreenhouse%20gas"&gt;greenhouse gas&lt;/a&gt; 22 times more powerful than &lt;a href="w%3Acarbon%20dioxide"&gt;carbon dioxide&lt;/a&gt;.

Sergei Kirpotin, of &lt;a href="w%3ATomsk%20State%20University"&gt;Tomsk State University&lt;/a&gt; warned ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Scientist"&gt;New Scientist&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that the event is an "ecological landslide that is probably irreversible and is undoubtedly connected to climatic warming".

David Viner, of the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20East%20Anglia"&gt;University of East Anglia&lt;/a&gt; told ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Guardian"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;♡❤: "When you start messing around with these natural systems, you can end up in situations where it's unstoppable". He also warns that this event was not considered by the &lt;a href="w%3AIntergovernmental%20Panel%20on%20Climate%20Change"&gt;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change&lt;/a&gt;.

In May, scientists from the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Alaska%20System"&gt;University of Alaska&lt;/a&gt; found methane "hotspots" in eastern Siberia where the gas bubbles out from thawing permafrost bogs at a rate that prevents the surface from freezing.

The permafrost has been intact for 11,000 years and started melting 3 to 4 years ago, according to Kirpotin.

The Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJulian%20McGauran"&gt;Julian McGauran&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href="Australian%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; had made an "unseemly" gesture across the floor of the Senate whilst it was in session on August 11, apparently as a result of interjections about a division taking place.

Whilst this was not immediately debated, Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Brown"&gt;Bob Brown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; had asked the Acting Deputy President of the Senate to look into the matter&lt;a href="http%3A//parlinfoweb.aph.gov.au/piweb/TranslateWIPILink.aspx%3FFolder%3DHANSARDS%26amp%3BCriteria%3DDOC_DATE%3A2005-08-11%253BSEQ_NUM%3A25%253B"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Later the President of the Senate ruled that the gesture was "unseemly but not obscene"&lt;a href="http%3A//parlinfoweb.aph.gov.au/piweb/TranslateWIPILink.aspx%3FFolder%3DHANSARDS%26amp%3BCriteria%3DDOC_DATE%3A2005-08-11%253BSEQ_NUM%3A64%253B"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. 

This ruling caused a fierce debate, with Senator Brown saying that McGauran's "arrogant and disgusting"&lt;a href="http%3A//parlinfoweb.aph.gov.au/piweb/TranslateWIPILink.aspx%3FFolder%3DHANSARDS%26amp%3BCriteria%3DDOC_DATE%3A2005-08-11%253BSEQ_NUM%3A66%253B"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; actions exemplified the Government's attitude towards its new-found Senate majority, whilst Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARon%20Boswell"&gt;Ron Boswell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;National Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Senate leader, had criticised Brown of hypocrisy, stating that Brown had "broken every law in Australia" and "every law in &lt;a href="Tasmania"&gt;Tasmania&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;a href="http%3A//parlinfoweb.aph.gov.au/piweb/TranslateWIPILink.aspx%3FFolder%3DHANSARDS%26amp%3BCriteria%3DDOC_DATE%3A2005-08-11%253BSEQ_NUM%3A69%253B"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (which Bartlett noted as a point of order as being hyperbole).

Senator McGauran then spoke, stating that he "regret[ted] his actions"&lt;a href="http%3A//parlinfoweb.aph.gov.au/piweb/TranslateWIPILink.aspx%3FFolder%3DHANSARDS%26amp%3BCriteria%3DDOC_DATE%3A2005-08-11%253BSEQ_NUM%3A72%253B"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Brown however noted that this was not an unqualified apology. A motion was then put that the President's ruling be dissented from, which debate was set for another sitting. Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Evans"&gt;Chris Evans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Labor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Senate leader and Senator Brown had called for McGauran's sacking as Chief Government whip; his National Party superiors have said that they will speak to McGauran about the incident.

What began as a ground crew strike on Thursday has escalated into the grounding of all flights from &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Heathrow%20Airport"&gt;Heathrow&lt;/a&gt;'s Terminal 4 until at least 8pm Friday.

The row began with a funding crisis of meal provider, Gate Gourmet, which resulted in the axing of 200 full-time staff earlier on Wednesday. In reaction, unions of ground crews and baggage handlers from &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Airways"&gt;British Airways&lt;/a&gt; announced a stop work from Friday, which escalated into a full close-down of Terminal 4 on Friday due to overcrowding and backlog.

British Airways grounded more than 100 flights on Thursday evening, and by Friday evening, around 550 flights look to be cancelled. Other airlines which utilise Terminal 4 are also affected, including &lt;a href="w%3AQantas"&gt;Qantas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASri%20Lankan%20Airlines"&gt;Sri Lankan Airlines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AFinnair"&gt;Finnair&lt;/a&gt;, with incoming longhaul flights now being redirected to other European airports, including &lt;a href="w%3AFrankfurt"&gt;Frankfurt&lt;/a&gt;.

On the 11th August, the former Prime Minister of Japan &lt;a href="w%3ARyutaro%20Hashimoto"&gt;Riyutaro Hashimoto&lt;/a&gt;, age 68, formally indicated he would not run for the Okayama 4th constituency of the House of Representatives, the Lower House of Japan, due to defectiveness of his physical condition, possibly nominally. Since the current prime minister &lt;a href="w%3AJunichiro%20Koizumi"&gt;Junichiro Koizumi&lt;/a&gt; had resolved that House, an election will be held on September 11. 

The next day of that announcement, on the 12th, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) executive committee showed they had no intention to recognize him as a candidate to proportional representative constituency. There might be no possibility for him to run for the coming election as the LDP candidate and his political career would inevitably end. 

On the July, 2004 it was reported that Hashimoto did not state the donation of 1 hundred million yen from a lobbist organisation in the annual political financial income and outgo report, which is legally mandatory to all minister and parliament speakers. Hashimoto had received that donation from the Japan Dental Political Federation, one of his main supporting organisations. His relation between medical and pharmacy lobbyists began at least in 1963 when he was appointed as a secretary of Minister of Health and Welfare. In the same year, he ran for a constituency for which his father had run since his death in that year. Later he was appointed to the Minister of Health and Welfare and played a roll as the representative of this ministry during his career.

Hashimoto had been a speaker of the House of Representatives since September 1963. He had not lost his seat until now. He was appointed to the Minister of Health and Welfare, and the Minister of Industrial Minister successively. He was the president of the LDP from 1995 until the party lost at the election of the House of Councillors in 1998. He was also the Prime Minister of Japan from 1996 till his resignation from LDP presidency. In 2001 he ran again for the presidency of the party, but was defeated by the present Prime Minister Koizumi Junichiro.

In a policy change prompted by activists staying in Gaza protesting Israel's plan to close Jewish settlements there, Israel announced that nonresidents will not be allowed into the territory.

Israel's Southern Command on Thursday announced "only residents of the Israeli communities in the Gaza Strip will be allowed [entry into Gaza]", where the Jewish state plans to end its decades-long presence. 

Israel also will stop issuing permits to close relatives of settlers.

Pro-democracy demonstrations took place throughout the atoll nation of &lt;a href="w%3AMaldives"&gt;Maldives&lt;/a&gt; today, endangering the rule of authoritarian president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom. Reports indicated that the president was unable to approach the capital to take control.

The protestors, led by members of the newly-registered Maldivian Democratic Party, reportedly were demanding the release of political prisoners and the president's resignation. 

Gayoom has been president since 1978, and brooked little dissent during his tenure.

In a nationally broadcast radio sermon by former &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;ian president &lt;a href="Akbar%20Hashemi%20Rafsanjani"&gt;Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani&lt;/a&gt; on Friday, he said of the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;U. N.&lt;/a&gt; watchdog group adopting the resolution for Iran to stop nuclear enrichment activities, "The decision was a cruel one."

The Thurday adoption in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVienna"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by the governing board of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Atomic%20Energy%20Agency"&gt;International Atomic Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (IAEA) was unanimous and legally non-binding in asking Iran to suspend all nuclear fuel related activities. The board also requested a report from the agency's chief, &lt;a href="Mohamed%20ElBaradei"&gt;Mohamed ElBaradei&lt;/a&gt;, on its compliance by Tehran.

On Thursday, an Iranian member of their nuclear negotiating team, Sirous Nasseri, read in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; a statement made by his republic at the emergency governing board meeting of the IAEA regarding the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20Non-Proliferation%20Treaty"&gt;Nuclear proliferation treaty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (NPT):&lt;blockquote&gt;How can this body be called to react to an act, which is in full conformity with the NPT and the safeguards and constitutes a limited manifestation of the exercise of an inalienable right? A right, which by its own simple meaning, cannot be alienated from anyone. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

IAEA spokeswoman Melissa Fleming, said yesterday, "The resolution on Iran was just adopted without a vote, by consensus. So, full consensus. All 35 members of the board agreed to the language of the resolution text."

International concern over the Iranian nuclear enrichment program was led by the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; countries of &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="UK"&gt;Great Britain&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; (EU-3), along with the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. The pressure brought by these nations succeeded in obtaining language calling for the re-instatement of seals that were removed at the Uranium Conversion Facility in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIsfahan%20province"&gt;Isfahan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The seals were removed during the recent installation of surveillance cameras by IAEA.

The agency is to monitor &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATehran"&gt;Tehran&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for compliance to halt uranium enrichment. After a September 3 deadline, Iran again faces a possible referral to the &lt;a href="U.N.%20Security%20Council"&gt;U.N. Security Council&lt;/a&gt; where it could be subject to economic sanctions.

Meanwhile, the United States is likely to grant an entry &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVisa%20%28document%29"&gt;visa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to Iranian President &lt;a href="Mahmoud%20Ahmadinejad"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt; to attend the United Nations opening session next month in &lt;a href="New%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;. 

The &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush&lt;/a&gt; administration probe into whether Ahmadinejad was connected to the 1979-1981 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIran%20hostage%20crisis"&gt;Iranian hostage crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is looking like it was a case of mistaken identity. The decision remains tentative as intelligence reports within the administration continue to circulate, according to ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Washington%20Post"&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ citing U.S. officials.

All this week, prices at the pump have been reaching record levels across the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. Since yesterday, the price for a gallon of gasoline increased by as much as fifteen cents in some places. Large cities in California, such as San Francisco and Los Angeles, have reported gas prices that top $3.00 a gallon for regular grade, twenty cents higher than the state's average of $2.80. Chicago is reporting gas prices beyond $2.80. These price hikes are a direct reflection of the record price of crude oil at $67 per barrel and the fact that 12 U.S. refineries have reported issues that have affected output.

These price increases are concerning some who worry that those with considerable financial hardships will endure more of a burden. A poll was conducted for The Associated Press and America Online News about whether or not these gas prices will cause problems with people's personal finances and the poll found that 64 percent say gas prices will cause money problems for them in the next six months, while 35 percent did not think so.

According to a &lt;a href="w%3AAAA"&gt;AAA&lt;/a&gt; Texas motor club spokesman, additional price increases will more than likely continue into the weekend.

The &lt;a href="w%3ATransport%20and%20General%20Workers%20Union"&gt;Transport and General Worker's Union&lt;/a&gt; and Gate Gourmet, the company that laid off 500 workers after workers staged unofficial strike action, will attend further talks held at a conciliation service by the Advisory Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) on Saturday.

The director of Gate Gourmet, Richard Wells, denied that he was being "heavy-handed" over the dismissals. He insisted that the people affected were spoken to, and given written warnings before they were sacked.

As a result of &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Airways"&gt;British Airways&lt;/a&gt; (BA) staff at Heathrow joining Gate Gourmet's staff in the strike action, BA are running 50% of their short-haul flights, and 40% of their long haul flights today from 0600 BST/UTC+1. They are expecting to add more flights to the schedule as the day progresses, so passengers are advised to check the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.ba.com/"&gt;British Airways website&lt;/a&gt;.

Analysts said that the disruption may lose BA next to £40m because of the refunds that the company are paying out, loss of flight revenue, and the costs of accommodating passengers in nearby hotels.

Only passengers with confirmed reservations have been allowed to board flights at Heathrow. Barriers have been placed around Terminal 4 to stop people without reservations from joining flights. There are limited catering services on-board the flights.

British Airways advises passengers to telephone +44 (0)800 727 800 or check their &lt;a href="http%3A//www.ba.com"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; before travelling to the airport. They also said that they would refund customers that had to stay in a hotel on Friday night up to £100.

It is noted by passengers, though, that the advice line can be engaged for long periods, so users of the telephone line need to be patient.

&lt;a href="w%3AQantas"&gt;Qantas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFinnair"&gt;Finnair&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGB%20Airways"&gt;GB Airways&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASri%20Lankan%20Airlines"&gt;Sri Lankan Airlines&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Mediterranean"&gt;British Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt; are also affected, as they were serviced by BA's ground staff.

A study in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; has found that a so called "health inequality gap" between rich and poor, measured by infant mortality and life expectancy, has increased. Progress in narrowing the gap has been made on child poverty and improving housing, as well as cancer and heart disease death rates. Still, the life expectancy in the wealthiest areas of Britain is seven to eight years longer than the poorest areas. 

The public health minister, Caroline Flint, said so-called "health trainers" would be provided for poorer areas (along with extra funding) in order to help people adopt "a healthier way of life". The government had pledged to reduce the inequality gap by 10% between 1997 and 2010.

Concerns have also been raised about the level of health care in &lt;a href="w%3AAustria"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt;. Cancer and heart specialists have criticised the Austrian system. They argue that, due to lack of funds, patients are not treated as well as in other countries. Critics see these developments as leading to two-class medical care systems. Health minister Maria Rauch-Kallat has denied the allegations, saying that "everyone gets what they need". In a related move, non-monetary remunerations by pharmaceutical companies for doctors prescribing certain drugs have also come under heavy criticism.

The Foreign Minister of &lt;a href="w%3ASri%20Lanka"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALakshman%20Kadirgamar"&gt;Lakshman Kadirgamar&lt;/a&gt;, was fatally shot in the chest and head at his home on &lt;a href="w%3AAugust%2012"&gt;August 12&lt;/a&gt;. Two people have been arrested in connection with the attack but their identities have not been released.

The Inspector General of Police, Chandra Fernando told reporters, "It's the Tigers," blaming The &lt;a href="w%3ATamil%20Tigers"&gt;Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam&lt;/a&gt; (LTTE), who have observed a ceasefire since 2002. The rebels currently deny involvement in the shooting.

Since the shooting Sri Lanka has declared a state of emergency. Many fear this assassination and resulting countrywide lock down could jeopardize the island's fragile peace process.

Under the emergency rule, the authorities can deploy troops whenever they wish, detain suspects of terrorist activities without charge, and search and demolish buildings at will.

Many world leaders including &lt;a href="w%3AJan%20Peterson"&gt;Jan Peterson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANorway"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt;'s foreign minister and &lt;a href="w%3ACondoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State"&gt;Secretary of State&lt;/a&gt; has called this a senseless crime. India has called the shooting a "&lt;a href="w%3ATerrorism"&gt;terrorist crime&lt;/a&gt;" and promised any help that is needed to end this crisis in Sri Lanka.

<h1>Iraqi constitution met by Sunni resistance</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Iraqi%20constitution%20met%20by%20Sunni%20resistance&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Most points of disagreement on &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq's&lt;/a&gt; new constitution have been ironed out, and the constitution should be ready before the Monday deadline, the President &lt;a href="w%3AJalal%20Talabani"&gt;Jalal Talabani&lt;/a&gt; said in an announcement Saturday morning.

"The meetings are still going on and we have gone forward," Talabani told reporters. "There is a meeting today and another meeting tomorrow and God willing we will finish the job tomorrow." 

The largest disagreement is over the governing the &lt;a href="w%3AKurdish%20people"&gt;Kurdish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AShiite"&gt;Shiite&lt;/a&gt; areas of central and southern Iraq, as well as the role of &lt;a href="w%3AIslam"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt; in the state. 

Constitutional committee members have said the remaining major stumbling blocks were &lt;a href="w%3Afederalism"&gt;federalism&lt;/a&gt;, a Kurds-style autonomy given sudden Shiite support by the call from its leading politician &lt;a href="w%3AAbdul%20Aziz%20al-Hakim"&gt;Abdul Aziz al-Hakim&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3ASunni%20Islam"&gt;Sunni&lt;/a&gt; groups have called the move for federalism a deal breaker.

The controversy caused by the sudden Sunni call for federalism cast doubt on the chances for approval of the constitution draft by Monday's deadline. Sunnis fear that federal-autonomy zones will keep them from a share of the world's second largest known oil reserves. Those are concentrated in the Kurdish north and Shiite south.

But a Sunni participant Saleh al-Mutlaq said on Saturday, "An in principle agreement has been reached late yesterday that Iraq's oil revenues will be shared between the Shia, the Kurds and the Sunnis." The federal government would receive a percentage of oil revenues, and the rest would go to each governorate according to its population size."

Sunnis have still not agreed to any of the main points of the constitutional draft, but Kurdish National Assembly member &lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud%20Othman"&gt;Mahmud Othman&lt;/a&gt; said that Kurdish and Shiite groups could use their majority in the parliament to get the charter approved by Iraq's legislature.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; has played a strong role in the 71-member constitution committee writing the document described as the &lt;a href="w%3ALaw%20of%20Administration%20for%20the%20State%20of%20Iraq%20for%20the%20Transitional%20Period"&gt;Transitional Administrative Law&lt;/a&gt;. U.S. Ambassador &lt;a href="w%3AZalmay%20Khalilzad"&gt;Zalmay Khalilzad&lt;/a&gt; has acted as a broker between the Kurdish, Sunni Arab and Shiite Arab blocs.

During overnight raids, &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israeli&lt;/a&gt; soldiers arrested 10 people, allegedly members of &lt;a href="w%3AIslamic%20Jihad"&gt;Islamic Jihad&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3APalestinian"&gt;Palestinian&lt;/a&gt; militant group. The raids were conducted during two operations near the towns of &lt;a href="w%3AJenin"&gt;Jenin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANablus"&gt;Nablus&lt;/a&gt;. An &lt;a href="w%3AM16%20%28rifle%29"&gt;M-16&lt;/a&gt; rifle was also discovered during the raid near Jenin.

Meanwhile, &lt;a href="w%3AHamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt;, a group friendly to Islamic Jihad, made a rare public appearance 2 days before the Israeli pull-out of settlers and troops from &lt;a href="w%3AGaza"&gt;The Gaza Strip&lt;/a&gt;. They defied the &lt;a href="w%3APalestinian%20National%20Authority"&gt;Palestinian Authority&lt;/a&gt; by draping themselves in the colours of the group. On Friday, Palestinian Authority officials said only the Palestinian banner of red, black, green and white should be used to celebrate the withdrawal of Israel from Palestinian territory.

Hamas are planning to run in the parliamentary elections to be held in January, next year.

<h1>Julian McGauran makes rude gesture to Australian Senate/Brief</h1>
The Senator Julian McGauran in the Australian Senate had made an "unseemly" gesture across the floor of the Senate whilst it was in session on August 11, apparently as a result of interjections about a division taking place. Whilst this was not immediately debated, Senator Bob Brown had asked the Acting Deputy President of the Senate to look into the matter. Later the President of the Senate ruled that the gesture was "unseemly but not obscene."

Human rights groups around the world are marking the first anniversary of the &lt;a href="w%3AGatumba"&gt;Gatumba&lt;/a&gt; massacre, in which more than 150 Congolese "Banyamulenge" &lt;a href="w%3ATutsis"&gt;Tutsis&lt;/a&gt; were killed, at a refugee camp in western Burundi. 

"On this first anniversary of this unspeakable atrocity, we have the moral obligation to honour the memory of these people who were killed just because of their Tutsi ethnic origins", said Emmanuel Nkurunziza of the Burundian campaign group "Action Contre &lt;a href="w%3AGenocide"&gt;Genocide&lt;/a&gt;".

"The search for those responsible for the massacre continues", said the UN's mission to Burundi (ONUB), in a statement. 

In the immediate aftermath of the Gatumba attack, the hardlined Hutu-extremist rebel group Palipehutu-FNL (FNL) claimed responsibility, saying that they had no fear of being held to account because they had become "untouchable". UN investigators suggest that Rwandan and Congolese milita groups may also have been involved in the attack. The FNL later claimed that the &lt;a href="w%3Arefugee"&gt;refugee&lt;/a&gt; camp was a military base. The UN has found no evidence for this claim, and human rights groups pointed out that nearly half of the dead were children.

2,000 people, including survivors and relatives of the dead, today attended a memorial service in Burundi, Reuters has reported. 

"What happened on August 13 was a genocide... One year after the massacre nothing has been done... We demand that justice be done", &lt;a href="w%3ABanyamulenge"&gt;Banyamulenge&lt;/a&gt; spokesman Binagana Amon is quoted as saying. Amon also criticised the United Nations for its "silence" over the attack. 

The London-based "International Action Network on Small Arms" (&lt;a href="w%3AIANSA"&gt;IANSA&lt;/a&gt;) today paid tribute to the 156 victims of Gatumba, who included a local member of the organisation, Pastor Jaques Rutekereza. 

"His deep faith gave him the courage to face his awful death, and the death of those he loved, with dignity and courage", IANSA said last year, in a statement honouring Rutekereza. "The world has lost a great man. It has lost a man of peace."

Rutekereza died with six of his children, according to IANSA. 

Members of the &lt;a href="w%3ACongolese"&gt;Congolese&lt;/a&gt; diaspora have been active in the commemorations. The community in Portland, Maine has organised a weekend of events, including public testimonies from those who lost loved ones in the attack, and a talk by John B. Robinson, who helped produce the film "&lt;a href="w%3AHotel%20Rwanda"&gt;Hotel Rwanda&lt;/a&gt;."

"We can't forget them", Georges Budagu told the Portland Press Herald. 

"We want to make sure the United Nations and the United States use their influence to bring those people... to justice". Three of Budagu's cousins died in the massacre. 

The UN, in turn, asked the Burundian authorities to do more to pursue the perpetrators:

"In the name of the victims, and as part of the effort to end impunity for the killings and massacres that have plagued this region for too many years, we urge the Government of &lt;a href="w%3ABurundi"&gt;Burundi&lt;/a&gt; to complete its investigation, issue the report of its findings and bring those responsible to justice."

The UN also repeated its call for Burundi to involve the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Criminal%20Court"&gt;International Criminal Court&lt;/a&gt; in the investigation. Previous efforts had stalled due to opposition to the Court within the UN Security Council.

Following the FNL's admission of responsibility for Gatumba, the Burundian government produced international arrest warrants for the group's leaders Agathon Rwasa and Pasteur Habimana. Regional heads condemned the group as a terrorist organisation, with South African's President &lt;a href="w%3AThabo%20Mbeki"&gt;Thabo Mbeki&lt;/a&gt; likening the FNL's ideology to that of the &lt;a href="w%3ANazis"&gt;Nazis&lt;/a&gt;. Yet when Rwasa held a press conference in Tanzania in May, no attempt was made to arrest him. A ceasefire deal signed soon afterwards broke down within days. 

Burundi's refugee minister Francoise Ngendahayo today said that her government is committed to seeing justice for the victims of Gatumba. 

"Those responsible will be arrested but Burundi cannot do this work alone, we need the collaboration of the DR Congo and the UN", she told Reuters.

Burundi's President-elect recently suggested that the FNL could be allowed to join his government. Some analysts believe that offering the group an amnesty might help bring peace to Burundi. Others argue that this could make the situation worse.

"For reasons of diplomacy, people are sitting at the exact same table as war criminals, and in some cases granting them immunity. If the atrocities are to end there must be at least some indications that justice will be done", &lt;a href="w%3AHuman%20Rights%20Watch"&gt;Human Rights Watch&lt;/a&gt; spokesman Stephan Van Praet told Reuters, in the aftermath of Gatumba.

Action Contre Genocide's Emmanuel Nkurunziza today criticised the UN for what he called a "paradoxical" response to the massacre. Despite widespread international condemnation of the attack, the UN representative in Burundi Carolyn McAskie held face-to-face meetings with the FNL in &lt;a href="w%3ANairobi"&gt;Nairobi&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year.

"There was no repentance from these killers prior to the meeting; nonetheless, she went on to relay their so-called demands", he said.

Local media recently reported 300 civilian deaths at the hands of the FNL during June and July. An estimated 300,000 people, mostly &lt;a href="w%3Acivilians"&gt;civilians&lt;/a&gt;, have died in Burundi since civil war broke out in 1993.

A last minute deal reached Saturday dictates that about 1,000 Israeli settler greenhouses located in the Gaza strip will not be dismantled after Monday's pullout. Instead, they will remain standing and be placed in Palestinian control.

The deal allows one of the Gaza strip's largest employers to remain intact. Greenhouses in the region currently employ more than 4,000 people.

The deal was pioneered by envoy James Wolfenson. Mr. Wolfenson will purchase the greenhouses using funds amounting to US$14 million. He will proceed to turn the properties over to Palestine.

Daniel Ayalon, Israeli ambassador to the United States, spoke optimistically of the greenhouse agreement. Said Mr. Ayalon, "As we leave Gaza, and some parts of the West Bank, we are not leaving scorched earth. On the contrary, we are leaving behind means for them to take over and immediately better their situation."

In Gaza, the median age is 15 and about 80% of the population live in poverty.

&lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice"&gt;Dept. of Justice&lt;/a&gt; attorney for 40 years, Dave Margolis, was assigned by James Comey on August 12 to take over his position as the acting Deputy Attorney General. The former assistant deputy replaces Comey as the acting boss of &lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Fitzgerald"&gt;Patrick Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt;, the lead prosecutor of the &lt;a href="Valerie%20Plame%20scandal"&gt;Plame&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="CIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; leak case. Comey left the post for the private sector as general council for &lt;a href="w%3ALockheed%20Martin"&gt;Lockheed Martin Corp.&lt;/a&gt;

Al Martin, ret. Navy Lt. Commander (who testified for Kerry's &lt;a href="w%3AIran-Contra%20Affair"&gt;Iran-Contra&lt;/a&gt; hearings) alleges that when David Margolis was the Domestic Criminal Section Chief, he helped limit the liability of &lt;a href="w%3ARonald%20Reagan"&gt;Ronald Reagan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20H.%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George H. W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; in the Iran-Contra affair. Martin is also on record as having alleged that Margolis was part of a "restricted access group" known as RAG-1, which "was first to develop and then to coordinate the CIA's policy of trafficking in narcotics on a large-scale basis, in order to produce ongoing covert revenue streams pursuant to the aid and sustenance of illegal operations of state," according to Martin.

&lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; nominated &lt;a href="w%3ATimothy%20Flanigan"&gt;Timothy E. Flanigan&lt;/a&gt; for Comey's job. The Comey departure, without Margolis stepping in, would have left two key posts at the Justice Department unfilled. The head of the Criminal Justice, formerly occupied by Christopher Wray, has been empty since May. 

Flanigan is facing tough questioning during his &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20the%20Judiciary"&gt;Senate Judiciary Committee&lt;/a&gt; confirmation process. &lt;a href="US%20Senate"&gt;Senator&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AArlen%20Specter"&gt;Arlen Specter&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="Pennsylvania"&gt;PA&lt;/a&gt;) said he is unsure whether he would vote for his confirmation. Flanigan's role in the aggressive interrogation techniques used on detainees from &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; and his ties to lobbyist &lt;a href="Jack%20Abramoff"&gt;Jack Abramoff&lt;/a&gt; are being probed.

&lt;a href="w%3AKurmanbek%20Bakiev"&gt;Kurmanbek Bakiev&lt;/a&gt; has been sworn in as the president of &lt;a href="w%3AKyrgyzstan"&gt;Kyrgyzstan&lt;/a&gt; after winning the elections one month ago with an 89% majority.

Following the exile of the previous president, &lt;a href="w%3AAskar%20Akayev"&gt;Askar Akayev&lt;/a&gt;, Bakiev was appointed acting president until elections were held.

Mr Bakiev's main competitor in the elections was &lt;a href="w%3AFelix%20Kulov"&gt;Felix Kulov&lt;/a&gt;. They agreed upon a power-sharing pact, meaning that Mr Kulov would become Prime Minister if Mr Bakiev became president.

Bakiev took his oath of office after a military parade, in front of diginitaries in &lt;a href="w%3ABishkek"&gt;Bishkek&lt;/a&gt;'s central square.

A &lt;a href="w%3AHelios%20Airways"&gt;Helios&lt;/a&gt; airliner (&lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20737"&gt;Boeing 737&lt;/a&gt;, flight HCY 522) with 115 passengers and 6 crew onboard has crashed into a mountain at 09:04 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt; (12:04 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3AEEST"&gt;EEST&lt;/a&gt;) near &lt;a href="w%3AGrammatiko"&gt;Grammatiko&lt;/a&gt;, 40 &lt;a href="w%3Akilometre"&gt;kilometre&lt;/a&gt;s (25 &lt;a href="w%3Amile"&gt;mile&lt;/a&gt;s) north of &lt;a href="w%3AAthens"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt;, while approaching the &lt;a href="w%3AAthens%20International%20Airport"&gt;capital's airport&lt;/a&gt;. All on board perished. The plane was travelling from &lt;a href="w%3ALarnaca"&gt;Larnaca&lt;/a&gt;, in the southeast of &lt;a href="w%3ACyprus"&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt; (Greek:Kypros, Κύπρος) and scheduled to arrive in &lt;a href="w%3APrague"&gt;Prague&lt;/a&gt; after a stop in Athens.

<h3>In-flight events</h3>

Immediately after take-off, the pilots reported a problem with the air conditioning system of the aircraft and requested to stay at a low altitude. A few minutes later, the pilots alerted the station that the problem had been fixed and requested permission to ascend. This information however has been denied by the Director of Helios Airways. As the plane approached Athens, all communication abruptly ceased, and the plane never issued a &lt;a href="w%3Amayday"&gt;mayday&lt;/a&gt; distress signal. Two Greek &lt;a href="w%3AF-16"&gt;F-16&lt;/a&gt; military aircraft were assigned to observe the plane. The pilots of the F-16s noted that one airliner pilot appeared to be unconscious and the other was not in the cockpit.

CBC reported the following: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;On Wednesday [August 17, 2005], state-run and private media, quoting anonymous defense ministry officials, said the two fighter pilots saw someone in the cockpit take control of the plane, which was flying in a gradually descending holding pattern apparently on autopilot. That person, probably a man who experts say must have had flight training, then banked the plane away from Athens, lowering it to 2,000 feet and then climbing back up to 7,000 feet before the plane apparently ran out of fuel and crashed. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The F-16s accompanied the airliner until it crashed.

<h3>Possible malfunctions and causes</h3>

The Greek F-16 pilots saw at least one of the aircraft's pilots may have become unconscious before the crash, causing control of the plane to be lost. The emergency oxygen masks were also reported to have dropped.

There had been speculation that an electrical fire or some other cause could have flooded the cabin with carbon monoxide or another gas that would render the passengers unconscious. However, the chief coroner of Athens, Greece, said that tests showed none of the passengers or crew had carbon monoxide in their blood. It was also speculated that the air-supply system of the aircraft may have failed, causing a loss of air pressure within the cockpit. This malfunction can cause a steep drop in air temperature. On &lt;a href="w%3ADecember%2016"&gt;December 16&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3A2004"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt; the same aircraft made an emergency landing after failure of the ventilation system at 35,000 feet and 3 passengers were hospitalized. However, an airline spokesman insisted that the plane was airworthy when it took off.

Tests showed that at least 26 people on the flight were still alive when it crashed. 

After a cabin decompression occurred onboard a &lt;a href="w%3ALearjet"&gt;Learjet&lt;/a&gt; carrying golf pro &lt;a href="w%3APayne%20Stewart"&gt;Payne Stewart&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3A1999"&gt;1999&lt;/a&gt;, all the travelers lost consciousness and the plane eventually crashed with no survivors.

<h3>Passengers</h3>

Helios Airlines was unable to supply a complete passenger list, having only first initials and surnames available for investigators. 

The official passenger list released by Cyprus Police, as reported by CNA, indicates that there were 22 young persons onboard aged 4-16. Most of the passengers were Cypriot, a small number were Greek and one of the pilots was German. There were 4 Armenian passengers who lived in Cyprus.

The complete list, in Greek, has been published by the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.in.gr/news/Reviews/Review497490/assets/HCY522.xls"&gt;Cyprus News Agency&lt;/a&gt;.

<h3>Post-crash events</h3>

After the crash, a fire started around the airliner. It was extinguished by firefighters after 2 hours. The fire burned most of the bodies that are now being collected by special firefighter units and transferred to the city of Shisto, near Athens. Meanwhile, the two F-16 pilots were transferred to Ministry of Defense to give their report.

The flight data recorder has been recovered. The cockpit voice recorder was found the following morning in bad condition. The two devices will be sent to Paris for examination.

Nektarios-Sotirios Voutas &lt;a href="http%3A//www.suntimes.com/output/news/cst-nws-jet15.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http%3A//www.turkishpress.com/news.asp%3Fid%3D65434"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported that a passenger (his cousin) sent a &lt;a href="w%3Ashort%20message%20service"&gt;text message&lt;/a&gt; that read: "The pilot has turned blue [in the face]. [F]arewell we're freezing". He was arrested the following day as it appeared to be a hoax &lt;a href="http%3A//www.news24.com/News24/World/News/0%2C%2C2-10-1462_1754456%2C00.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

<h3>Reactions from Helios Airways</h3>
Helios has informed the relatives of the victims; however, the company has been met with criticism for failing to release the passenger list quickly.

Helios Airways released a statement on their &lt;a href="http%3A//flyhelios.com/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; today, stating, "Our thoughts are with the families of those on board at this difficult time."

An emergency telephone number in &lt;a href="w%3ANicosia%2C%20Cyprus"&gt;Nicosia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACyprus"&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt; can be contacted at ♡❤♡+357/70003737, 22 – 446146♡❤♡.

<h3>Official reactions</h3>

The Cypriot government has declared three days of national mourning and ordered flags to be lowered on half-mast.

Upon allegations brought by the Communications and Works Minister and the chief of police, warrants were issued by the attorney general to search Helios Airways offices &lt;a href="http%3A//today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx%3Ftype%3DtopNews%26amp%3BstoryID%3D2005-08-15T183022Z_01_KWA433859_RTRIDST_0_NEWS-CRASH-GREECE-DC.XML"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

<h1>David Lange, former New Zealand prime minister, dies at 63</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=David%20Lange%2C%20former%20New%20Zealand%20prime%20minister%2C%20dies%20at%2063&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealanders&lt;/a&gt; woke up Sunday to learn of the death of one of their most notable leaders. &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Lange"&gt;David Lange&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; for just five years in the mid-1980s, but his administration left an indelible mark on the nation economically and socially, and also reoriented its foreign policy. 

Lange, 63, died of &lt;a href="w%3Arenal%20failure"&gt;renal failure&lt;/a&gt; at 10 p.m. on August 13, a day after his family decided to discontinue artificial life support. He had fought a long battle with multiple ailments. In 2002, he was diagnosed with &lt;a href="w%3Aamyloidosis"&gt;amyloidosis&lt;/a&gt;, a rare and incurable blood disorder. Lange defied his doctors' initial predictions that he had only four months to live, and following a round of chemotherapy, appeared to rally for a time, but in mid-2005 his condition took a sudden turn for the worse. He entered hospital in &lt;a href="w%3AAuckland"&gt;Auckland&lt;/a&gt; in mid July, 2005, to undergo nightly peritoneal dialysis and battled end-stage kidney failure. On August 2, he had his lower-right leg amputated without a general anaesthetic, as a result of diabetes complications.

His declining health resulted in the publication of his memoir ♡❤My Life♡❤ being brought forward to August 8. He lived to see this happen and gave his last interview on &lt;a href="w%3ATV3%20%28New%20Zealand%29"&gt;TV3&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Campbell%20%28broadcaster%29"&gt;John Campbell&lt;/a&gt; the same day.

Lange was first elected to the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Parliament"&gt;New Zealand Parliament&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href="w%3Abyelection"&gt;byelection&lt;/a&gt; in 1977. As a lawyer, he had built up a personal rapport with his &lt;a href="w%3AMangere"&gt;Mangere&lt;/a&gt; constituency by representing poor clients free of charge. In less than three years, he was elected Deputy Leader of the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Labour%20Party"&gt;Labour Party&lt;/a&gt;, and, after an initial failed bid for the leadership in 1980, was chosen to replace &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Rowling"&gt;Bill Rowling&lt;/a&gt; as the party leader in 1983. He went on to lead the party to a landslide victory in the general election held on 14 July, 1984, ousting the longtime Prime Minister, &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Muldoon"&gt;Robert Muldoon&lt;/a&gt;. 

Despite his nominal socialism, he initiated sweeping reforms to deregulate the economy and boost private enterprise, and his was regarded as a government of the left only in name. In &lt;a href="w%3AForeign%20relations%20of%20New%20Zealand"&gt;foreign policy&lt;/a&gt;, however, Lange remained somewhat further to the left: he banned nuclear-armed and powered warships from entering New Zealand's ports, straining a once-close relationship with the United States. In 1985 he took part in a widely-televised Oxford Union debate &lt;a href="http%3A//publicaddress.net/default%2C1578.sm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, arguing for the proposition that "nuclear weapons are morally indefensible", in opposition to U.S. televangelist &lt;a href="w%3AJerry%20Falwell"&gt;Jerry Falwell&lt;/a&gt;.

Lange won the 1987 election by an even greater margin than in 1984, but internal divisions within the Labour Party were weakening his position. Many rank and file members of the party felt that the government's economic reforms were a betrayal of Labour's socialist ideology. Attempting to appease the left, Lange fired his right-wing Finance Minister, &lt;a href="w%3ARoger%20Douglas"&gt;Roger Douglas&lt;/a&gt;, late in 1988. When the party caucus, which under Labour Party rules chooses the cabinet, insisted on his reinstatement to the cabinet in mid-1989, Lange resigned on 8 August, 1989.

Lange was widely regarded as a larger-than-life figure, who was never far from controversy. Once regarded as a fervent Methodist, Lange weathered a storm in 1990 after his decision to leave his first wife, Naomi, and move in with Margaret Pope, whom he later married. In 1996, Lange and Pope had a daughter, Edith; Lange, whose health was already in decline, said that his fondest hope was to see Edith grow up. Responding to questions about whether he was afraid of being "an old dad," he replied, "No ... but I'm afraid of being a dead dad." He said in another interview the same year, on announcing his final retirement from politics, that he hoped to spend more time with his family, to concentrate on lecturing and writing, "and to grow old." This last wish did not materialize.

Lange was remembered for his intelligence, his wit, and his loud booming voice. Supporters and opponents alike spoke warmly of Lange. Whether they agreed with his policies or not, they described him as a deeply compassionate man who would be sadly missed.

Some &lt;a href="w%3Acancer"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; specialists have stepped up calls for smokers and ex-smokers to undergo advanced &lt;a href="w%3Ascreening%20%28medicine%29"&gt;screen&lt;/a&gt;ing for &lt;a href="w%3Alung%20cancer"&gt;lung cancer&lt;/a&gt; . They reacted to the recent deaths of &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Jennings"&gt;Peter Jennings&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABarbara%20Bel%20Geddes"&gt;Barbara Bel Geddes&lt;/a&gt; and the disclosure that &lt;a href="w%3ADana%20Reeve"&gt;Dana Reeve&lt;/a&gt; has lung cancer by urging people to have their lungs screened with special helical &lt;a href="w%3Acomputer%20tomography"&gt;CT&lt;/a&gt; chest scans.

Because &lt;a href="w%3Ahealth%20insurance"&gt;health insurance&lt;/a&gt; plans do not cover such screening, anxious patients who can afford it are paying about $300 for the test out of pocket. The &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Cancer%20Society"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt; discourages using the advanced CT scan technique for screening because doctors do not yet know how to interpret findings of small &lt;a href="w%3Alesion"&gt;lesion&lt;/a&gt;s. A helical scan can show lumps as small as 2 &lt;a href="w%3Amillimetre"&gt;millimetre&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href="w%3Adiameter"&gt;diameter&lt;/a&gt;, but doctors do not know what to make of such lesions. The &lt;a href="w%3Atumor"&gt;tumor&lt;/a&gt;s may not actually be cancerous, and even small cancers may spontaneously remit or may grow so slowly that &lt;a href="w%3Asurgery"&gt;surgery&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Aradiation%20therapy"&gt;radiation&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3Achemotherapy"&gt;chemotherapy&lt;/a&gt; would do far more harm than good. Preliminary results of a large ongoing &lt;a href="w%3Amedical%20research"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, expected within a year, may provide tentative guidelines on when to perform a &lt;a href="w%3Abiopsy"&gt;biopsy&lt;/a&gt; and when CT screening would be worthwhile.

Smoking one pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years or more brings a 50 percent chance of dying from lung cancer. For any smoker, 10 years of abstinence cuts the risk in half. Women are more vulnerable than men even if they don't smoke. Environmental pollutants work with smoking to increase risk. People with affected parents or siblings are 2&amp;ndash;3 times more likely to fall ill with lung cancer. A &lt;a href="w%3Amalignant"&gt;malignant&lt;/a&gt; tumor can grow silently for years. In the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; by the time it is recognized a lung cancer has &lt;a href="w%3Ametastasis"&gt;spread&lt;/a&gt; in 3 out of 4 &lt;a href="w%3Apatient"&gt;patient&lt;/a&gt;s. Routine chest &lt;a href="w%3AX-ray%23Medical%20uses"&gt;X-ray&lt;/a&gt; screening does not improve survival rate. Although patients treated after their lung cancer has shown up in a highly sensitive helical (also called "spiral") CT scan are much more likely to survive, this may only be because small cancers grow very slowly or would cause no trouble even without treatment.

On the other hand, some cancer experts already strongly support performing the screening. They point out that prompt treatment of lung cancer clearly improves &lt;a href="w%3Aprognosis"&gt;prognosis&lt;/a&gt; and that an equivocal scan can be repeated after some months to see if a lesion has enlarged. Furthermore, a decision not to wait for conclusive science but to undergo a helical scan would be supported by consideration of a patient's age, family history, history of smoking and other &lt;a href="w%3Arisk%20factor"&gt;risk factor&lt;/a&gt;s. Annual scanning has been recommended for people over age 50 who have smoked 1 pack daily for 30 years or 2 packs for 15 and who also have a known lung condition.

<h1>Cypriot plane with 121 on board crashes in Greece, no passengers survive/Brief</h1>
A Helios Airways plane with 121 onboard has crashed into a mountain near the Greek island of Grammatikos, approximately 40 kilometres north of Athens. No survivors have been reported.

The crash occurred at 09:04 UTC this morning. After communication was lost with ground control twenty minutes after take-off, the aircraft was joined by two Greek F-16 military aircrafts until the plane crashed. The pilots of the F-16s noted that one airliner pilot appeared to be unconscious and the other was not in the cockpit. Immediatiately after take-off, the pilots reported a problem with the pressurization system of the aircraft, and later a passenger sent a text message communicating that it had become extremely cold in the cabin and that people were freezing to death. It is speculated that the air-supply system of the plane may have failed.

<h1>Paula Abdul cleared of sex scandal after 'American Idol' inquiry</h1>

Executives of the U.S. &lt;a href="w%3AFox%20network"&gt;Fox network&lt;/a&gt; said Friday that singer &lt;a href="w%3APaula%20Abdul"&gt;Paula Abdul&lt;/a&gt; was cleared of any wrongdoing in regard to charges that she had an improper relationship with former ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Idol"&gt;American Idol&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ contestant &lt;a href="w%3ACorey%20Clark"&gt;Corey Clark&lt;/a&gt;. The network cleared her to return to the show for its fifth season.

♡❤American Idol♡❤ has topped network television ratings as the most-watched program in the U.S. for the past three years. Abdul is one of the three judges of the talent/variety program, where she is popularly referred to as the "nice one" by contestants. 

Fox reportedly hired a former federal prosecutor to lead an investigation into whether Abdul compromised the integrity of its flagship series. After an investigation of more than three months, interviewing 43 people and looking over documents supplied by both Abdul and Clark, the investigation showed no proof that Abdul had a sexual relationship with Clark.

Clark was booted from the second season of ♡❤Idol♡❤ after it was discovered he hid a previous domestic violence arrest record from producers. Two years later, he told reporters that he had been involved in a secret romantic relationship with Abdul, which would have been a violation of the show's rules and Abdul's employment contract.

"I'm grateful this ordeal is over, and I'm so looking forward to getting back to the job I love," Abdul said in an Associated Press interview after the decision was announced to keep her on the show.

&lt;a href="Cindy%20Sheehan"&gt;Cindy Sheehan&lt;/a&gt;, the grieving mother of a fallen soldier in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, has gained national attention for her efforts to demand the &lt;a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; speak with her personally. "What I want to ask is, 'What noble cause did my son die for?' And if he says that it was to get rid of &lt;a href="Saddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam&lt;/a&gt; or liberate the Iraqi people, I'm not going to buy it." Mrs. Sheehan told &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASalon.com"&gt;Salon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; reporters. Prompted by President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;'s announcement that Americans in Iraq have died for a 'noble cause', Sheehan has been camping near Bush's &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; ranch for the past week to demand a private conversation with the President. "I don't want comfort," she told &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACox%20Newspapers"&gt;Cox Newspapers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , "I want the truth."

Mr. Bush said he was aware of the pleas of the grieving mothers, "But whether it be here or in &lt;a href="Washington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; or anywhere else, there's somebody who has got something to say to the President, that's part of the job. And I think it's important for me to be thoughtful and sensitive to those who have got something to say. But I think it's also important for me to go on with my life, to keep a balanced life."

Cindy has been joined in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACrawford%2C%20Texas"&gt;Crawford&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by hundreds of supporters, including many other mothers of fallen soldiers, who are camping out with her and joining her in calling "for the truth" about why their sons had to die. Rallies of support are also taking place and being scheduled across the nation, and contributions from citizens across the world are flowing into the "Peace House", a nearby cottage providing shelter and support for the mothers.

Casey's grandparents and other members of her extended family issued a statement emailed to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADrudge%20Report"&gt;Drudge Report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; website, which reveals their disagreement with the actions and statements that Mrs. Sheehan has made and accuses her of using her son's death to promote a personal agenda:

Mrs. Sheehan has responded by saying that political views within her extended family have always been diverse, but she is happy that her husband and children share her views and are supporting her efforts. She says her husband Pat, couldn't bear having Casey's things at home and put most of them in storage. "We grieved in totally different ways. He wanted to grieve by distracting himself. I wanted to immerse myself."

Mrs. Sheehan and her husband were part of a group that met with the President following her son's death last year; a meeting that President Bush began with what she thought was an insultingly insensitive greeting; "Who we'all gonna honor today." Mrs. Sheehan says she had mixed feelings about Bush's demeanor at the meeting, but kept quiet. When more information came out about the planning for the war, however, she started to feel utterly betrayed. "I want the kind of meeting that holds him accountable for the words he's actually said.", Sheehan told Time magazine reporters.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=60th%20anniversary%20of%20the%20end%20of%20the%20war%20in%20Asia%20and%20Pacific%20commemorated&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The 60th anniversary of the end of &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20War"&gt;Pacific War&lt;/a&gt;, has been commemorated by some people.

The first such commemoration was declared 60 years ago today, after Japan unconditionally surrendered following the &lt;a href="w%3AAtomic%20bombings%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki"&gt;atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href="w%3AVictory%20over%20Japan%20Day"&gt;VJ Day&lt;/a&gt; in the Allies. In Japan it is called "Commemoration Day of the End of the War". In Korea, one of former colonies of Japan, it has been celebrated as Independence Day, literally the Day when light was retreved. It is commemorated in the USA on 14 August, in most countries, on 15 August. 

At yesterday Japanese Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJunichiro%20Koizumi"&gt;Junichiro Koizumi&lt;/a&gt; laid a wreath at the Chidorigafuchi military ceremony and today expressed "deep remorse" and "heartfelt apology" for his country's past colonial rule and military aggression at the national commemoration ceremony. He also pledged co-operation with Japan's Asian neighbours to maintain peace and that his country would never go to war again. No such apologies were issued by Western governments for their past colonial rule or military aggressions at this or any other commemorations. There has been an apology made for imprisoning Japanese American citizens during WW2.

The Japanese ceremony was held at about noon, the exact time the surrender had been announced. Over 6000 people including the Emperor and Empress, political, industal, union and religious leaders as well as families of dead soldiers attended the ceremony in &lt;a href="w%3ABudokan"&gt;Budokan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATokyo"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt; with a wreath being laid. In Japan, this day is the Commemoration Day of the End of the War"; the dead during the war, mainly on the battlefield, are commemorated, not only from World War II, but also the Sino-Japanese War, which lasted for fifteen years from 1930. Flags were lowered to half-mast for their commemoration and at the noon bells, sirens and other means urged the people to pray for them in a minute of silence. 

The national commemoration ceremony this year in Japan was characterised by the absence of any parents of dead soldiers for the first time since 1946. The number of testimonies of that period has also declined. 

The Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi decided not to go to the &lt;a href="w%3AYasukuni%20Shrine"&gt;Yasukuni Shrine&lt;/a&gt; which commemorates Japan's war dead, including 14 indivuduals judged Class A war criminals by the Allies. Forty-one members of the Japanese &lt;a href="w%3ADiet%20of%20Japan"&gt;Diet&lt;/a&gt; did, however, visit the shrine, mostly to honour their own ancestors. Last year, Mr Koizumi's visit to the shrine sparked anti-Japanese riots in &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;.

Commemoration events have already taken place across the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, including a major event at &lt;a href="w%3ABlenheim%20Palace"&gt;Blenheim Palace&lt;/a&gt; -- home of the late Prime Minister, Sir &lt;a href="w%3AWinston%20Churchill"&gt;Winston Churchill&lt;/a&gt;. The UK previously marked the 60th &lt;a href="w%3AVictory%20in%20Europe%20Day"&gt;VE Day&lt;/a&gt; and VJ Day in a &lt;a href="UK%20remembers%20end%20of%20World%20War%20II%20sixty%20years%20on"&gt;combined national day of commemoration on 10 July&lt;/a&gt;.

Today, the &lt;a href="w%3APrince%20Philip%2C%20Duke%20of%20Edinburgh"&gt;Duke of Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash;. Patron of the &lt;a href="w%3ABurma%20Star%20Association"&gt;Burma Star Association&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Navy"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt; veteran of the war in the Mediterranean and Pacific &amp;mdash;. laid a wreath at the &lt;a href="w%3AMalta%20Siege%20Memoiral"&gt;Malta Siege Memorial&lt;/a&gt; in central London. He later met with veterans of the Far East conflict at a service in the &lt;a href="w%3AImperial%20War%20Museum"&gt;Imperial War Museum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;.

Prominent guests included &lt;a href="w%3AViscount%20Slim"&gt;Viscount Slim&lt;/a&gt; (son of the late &lt;a href="w%3AWilliam%20Slim%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Slim"&gt;Field Marshal Slim&lt;/a&gt;, commander of the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Fourteenth%20Army"&gt;British Fourteenth Army&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ABurma"&gt;Burma&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="w%3APatricia%20Knatchbull%2C%202nd%20Countess%20Mountbatten%20of%20Burma"&gt;Countess Mountbatten of Burma&lt;/a&gt; (daughter of the late &lt;a href="w%3ALouis%20Mountbatten%2C%201st%20Earl%20Mountbatten%20of%20Burma"&gt;Lord Louis Mountbatten&lt;/a&gt;, Supreme Allied Commander South East Asia Theatre), and &lt;a href="w%3AVera%20Lynn"&gt;Dame Vera Lynn&lt;/a&gt;. 

In &lt;a href="w%3ABangkok"&gt;Bangkok&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AThanpuying%20Poonsuk%20Phanomyong"&gt;Thanpuying Poonsuk Phanomyong&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APridi"&gt;Pridi&lt;/a&gt;'s widow, attended the unveling of a new memorial dedicated to the &lt;a href="w%3ASeri%20Thai"&gt;Seri Thai&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3AThammasat%20University"&gt;Thammasat University&lt;/a&gt;. An exhibition commemorating the end of the war was presided over by the Foreign Minister, Professor &lt;a href="w%3AEiji%20Murashima"&gt;Eiji Murashima&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAnand%20Panyarachun"&gt;Anand Panyarachun&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>Gaza Strip pullout under way</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Gaza%20Strip%20pullout%20under%20way&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israeli&lt;/a&gt; troops have begun implementing the historic pullout plan from the &lt;a href="w%3AGaza%20Strip"&gt;Gaza Strip&lt;/a&gt; by delivering eviction notices to the remaining settlers. They now have 48 hours, beginning this morning at 00:00 (UTC+3) to withdraw from their settlements before the army removes them by force.
Many settlers have vowed to resist their evacuation and promised fierce but nonviolent resistance. They have blocked the gate of &lt;a href="w%3ANeve%20Dekalim"&gt;Neve Dekalim&lt;/a&gt;, one of the largest settlements in the Strip, and called upon the soldiers to refuse their orders. "You're a partner to a crime," they screamed to army members.

Maj. Gen. Dan Harel, Israel's commander over the Gaza Strip, said the army will not waver in managing the pullout: "We will reach every settler, just as we have planned."

The &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael%20Defense%20Forces"&gt;IDF&lt;/a&gt; has sent about 55,000 troops to evacuate some 8,500 settlers.

The Israeli government believes that the withdrawal from the Gaza Strip is vital for the security of the country, although the decision to withdraw was very controversial, causing splits in Sharon's governing Likud party. Defence Minister &lt;a href="w%3AShaul%20Mofaz"&gt;Shaul Mofaz&lt;/a&gt; called it a "painful and difficult, but historic day".

In a televised prime time address, Israeli Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AAriel%20Sharon"&gt;Ariel Sharon&lt;/a&gt; outlined his reasons for the withdrawal: "This act is essential for Israel. Believe me, the pain I feel with this act is the full realisation that we must do it. [...] We cannot hold onto Gaza forever, more than a milion Palestinians live there [...] crowded in refugee camps, poverty and hotbeds of hatred with no hope on the horizon." Sharon also said that if any terrorist attacks by Palestinians were to occur after the pull-out his government would deliever the "harshest response ever". But he also stated that if the Palestians would stretch out their hand in peace "we will respond with an olive branch."

The &lt;a href="w%3APalestinian%20Authority"&gt;Palestinian Authority&lt;/a&gt; fully agrees with the Israeli actions. "We tell the Israeli people, `You have chosen the right path,'. Don't listen to the voices of the extremists who want a continuation of the occupation. I don't want — and I will not accept — any clashes with the army or the settlers," Palestinian President &lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud%20Abbas"&gt;Mahmoud Abbas&lt;/a&gt; told Channel 10 TV. Abbas also insisted that Israel must hand over control over the &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Bank"&gt;West Bank&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Jerusalem"&gt;East Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt; as well in the not so far future.

The PA itself has deployed some 7,500 security to prevent attacks by Palestinian extremists.

The Gaza Strip has been partially occupied by Jewish settlers for 38 years. The average per capita Palestinian annual income there in 2001 was $625 U.S. dollars and there are extreme dietary deficiencies among the Palestinian people. Israel has given no assurances that there will be a lessening of trade restrictions on goods coming out of the Gaza strip.

&lt;a href="w%3ARafael%20Palmeiro"&gt;Rafael Palmeiro&lt;/a&gt;, the Havana, Cuba born left-handed first baseman for the &lt;a href="w%3AMajor%20League%20Baseball"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; team &lt;a href="w%3A%20Baltimore%20Orioles"&gt;Baltimore Orioles&lt;/a&gt;, returned to play following a 10-game suspension after testing positive for banned &lt;a href="w%3A%20Anabolic%20steroid"&gt;steroids&lt;/a&gt;. Orioles interim manager &lt;a href="w%3ASam%20Perlozzo"&gt;Sam Perlozzo&lt;/a&gt; had Mr. Palmeiro wait three days in the &lt;a href="w%3ADugout%20%28baseball%29"&gt;dugout&lt;/a&gt; after his suspension before placing him in the play lineup.

His first appearance at bat at the Sunday contest in &lt;a href="w%3AOriole%20Park%20at%20Camden%20Yards"&gt;Camden Yards&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href="w%3AToronto%20Blue%20Jays"&gt;Toronto Blue Jays&lt;/a&gt; before a crowd of 30, 954 - a 64% capacity - was met with mixed reaction. 

Mr. Palmeiro is under investigation for possible perjury after he testified under oath to the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Government Reform on March 17, 2005 that, "I have never used steroids. Period." 

"Raffy", his nickname among fans, was sixth at bat and designated hitter during the first inning and was walked by Blue Jays pitcher Miguel Batista. 

Mr. Palmeiro, aged 40 and with a .277 batting average, is only the fourth baseball player to have at least 3,000 hits and more than 500 home runs during his career. He has earned the ire of fans and players alike because of contentions that his steroid usage enabled him to accomplish the rare feat. 

Mr. Palmeiro's four at-bat appearances were less than stellar. He hit three grounders mid-game after being walked in the first inning. 

Baltimore trailed the Blue Jays 7-6 with two men on base and two outs in the ninth inning when Mr. Palmeiro was sent to bat. He hit a fly ball which was caught by Blue Jay right-fielder Alex Rios, thus ending the game, making it the Blue Jays' fifth win in six games. 

Afterwards, Mr. Palmeiro told reporters, "I just wanted to get a hit. My timing was off." 

Coach Perlozzo commented about Mr. Palmeiro's appearance saying, "I'm sure it's a relief to get it out of the way. He's probably gone in there, taken a deep breath and gone, 'Whew, I'm glad that's over with. Now I can go ahead and play real baseball.' "

&lt;a href="w%3AOregon%20State%20University"&gt;Oregon State University&lt;/a&gt; (OSU) animal researchers in conjunction with the U.S. &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Agriculture"&gt;Department of Agriculture&lt;/a&gt;'s (USDA) &lt;a href="w%3ADubois%2C%20Idaho"&gt;Dubois, Idaho&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href="w%3ASheep"&gt;Sheep&lt;/a&gt; Experiment Station released a report on an OSU-USDA study which was initiated in 1995 after breeders asked the government to determine why some rams bought as breeding studs showed no interest in females. The researchers are working under a $2.8 million grant from the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Institutes%20of%20Health"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt; in hopes of developing a test which can determine the likelihood of a ram being female-oriented before it is sold as a stud.

By studying difference in the animal's brains after slaughter, the study also showed what could be a biological determiner for what makes a ram male-oriented instead of female-oriented sexually. The scientists' results showed that the anterior preoptic area of the rams' &lt;a href="w%3Ahypothalamus"&gt;hypothalamus&lt;/a&gt; was 50 percent smaller in male-oriented rams as opposed to female oriented rams. A 1991 study of human brains of &lt;a href="w%3AAIDS"&gt;AIDS&lt;/a&gt; victims showed a similar hypothalamus size difference between gay and heterosexual men.

The sheep researchers postulate that low levels of &lt;a href="w%3Aaromatase"&gt;aromatase&lt;/a&gt; hormones in the brain of a developing male sheep fetus may have kept the brain from fully masculinizing, leading to sexually male-oriented rams.

"This lends further support to the idea that homosexuality has biological underpinnings," Charles Roselli, a professor of physiology and pharmacology, said in an interview with the ♡❤Corvallis Gazette-Times♡❤.

Professor Stormshak believes that "understanding sexual drives and the continuum of sexual behavior could possibly help explain the scientific basis of sexual assault [and] put an end to assertions that homosexuality is a lifestyle choice."

Michael Essien will sign a contract worth £26 million (US$47 million, €38 million) with the London football club &lt;a href="w%3AChelsea%20F.C."&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt;. The record-breaking offer from Chelsea was accepted by the French club &lt;a href="w%3AOlympique%20Lyonnais"&gt;Lyon&lt;/a&gt; on Monday. Several of Chelsea's previous offers were rejected. 

Essien, the 22-year old Ghanian midlfielder, did not sign the 5-year contract on Tuesday as planned, because Lyon delayed sending the necessary forms to complete the transfer. Lyon will receive Chelsea player &lt;a href="w%3ATiago"&gt;Tiago&lt;/a&gt; along with the payment worth one third of Lyon's budget.

Essien will likely now arrive in London on Wednesday or Thursday for his medical.

Bernard Lacombe, a Lyon representative, describes playing in England as Essien's "dream". Lyon president Jean-Michael Aulas characterizes the loss of Essien as "a wrench but for the club this is a good deal".

The first findings from the preliminary investigations into &lt;a href="Cypriot%20plane%20with%20121%20on%20board%20crashes%20in%20Greece"&gt;Sunday's air disaster&lt;/a&gt; have been released. All 121 on board a Helios Boeing 737 died when it crashed near Athens after flying from Cyprus. A text message, reportedly sent from the doomed aircraft, has also been revealed as a hoax.

Greek Chief Coroner Philippos Koutsaftis stated "Until now I have done an autopsy on six bodies and first evidence is that when they were killed they had circulation in their heart and lungs. 

"That does not mean that they were conscious but that they had breath and circulation. They had circulation and heartbeat so they were alive."

Initial reports from the Greek Defence Ministry had suggested the bodies were "frozen solid" at the moment of impact.

The coroner stressed that as more post mortems were carried out new evidence may come to light.

Nothing is known about the cause of the disaster beyond the fact that everyone on board the airliner was incapacitated at some point, and that emergency oxygen masks had been used. Speculation abounds, with the theory that the airliner failed to maintain pressurisation at some point being the most popular theory.

Helios has said the aircraft was maintained in line with European regulations and had also received a standard inspection before take-off.

Greek police have also arrested a man who claimed his cousin texted him from the airliner, saying the pilots were blue in the face and that they were freezing. He was brought to the district attorney where two charges were filed against him, for lying to the authorities and for spreading false information, and a trial was scheduled. The man claimed that his intention was to gain publicity.

Police have also attended Helios's offices to requisition documents as part of the investigation into the disaster.

It has also been revealed that Helios is owned by a British company, Libra Holidays Group. Helios are giving the relatives of each victim €19,000 in initial compensation, as is required by the Montreal Convention and EU regulations.

Some infants are being prevented from boarding planes at U.S. airports because their names match or resemble those listed on the United States' "&lt;a href="w%3Ano-fly%20list"&gt;no-fly list&lt;/a&gt;".

The &lt;a href="w%3ATransport%20Safety%20Administration"&gt;Transport Safety Administration&lt;/a&gt;, which maintains the list, has told airlines that children under twelve should not be stopped from boarding or subjected to additional checks, even if their names are on the list. Despite this, infants whose names register with the "no-fly list" are being impeded at major airports across the nation.

The U.S. government has maintained a list of people who are barred from flying or required to pass additional security checks since before the &lt;a href="w%3A9/11"&gt;9/11&lt;/a&gt; attacks, but the list has grown from a few dozen to more than 100,000 since then. Critics of the list, such as the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union"&gt;American Civil Liberties Union&lt;/a&gt;, say not enough detail is provided on the list to accurately identify who it is meant to be targeting, resulting in innocents being snagged. The TSA is investigating 89 children who either complained themselves that their name is on the list, or had complaints filed on their behalf. Fourteen of them are babies under two.

Richard A. Altomare, Chairman of the Coalition for Luggage Security sees the babies debacle as indicative of more serious concerns; "We see articles daily about luggage and airport security. Each one contradicts what the TSA says it is doing to provide safer air travel for the public. The flying public is distracted by hopping on one foot with their shoes in one hand and their belt in another, or babies being held up because their names are the same as or similar to those of possible terrorists on the government's 'no-fly list.' But meanwhile, uninspected or minimally inspected cargo is loaded into the belly of the same plane. This just means there is no true reform, but rather a facade to give the illusion of real reform."

<h3>Reactions and effects</h3>
As a precaution, the &lt;a href="w%3ATohoku"&gt;Tohoku&lt;/a&gt; Electric &lt;a href="w%3Anuclear%20power"&gt;nuclear power&lt;/a&gt; plants have been shut down.

Electric supply ceased due to the earthquake in the &lt;a href="w%3AMiyagi%20Prefecture"&gt;Miyagi Prefecture&lt;/a&gt; and in its southern neighbor, &lt;a href="w%3AFukushima%20Prefecture"&gt;Fukushima Prefecture&lt;/a&gt;, and 17,000 households in total have been affected and lost power.

Railway transports including &lt;a href="w%3AT%C5%8Dhoku%20Shinkansen"&gt;Tōhoku Shinkansen&lt;/a&gt; have been stopped. &lt;a href="w%3ASendai%2C%20Miyagi"&gt;Sendai&lt;/a&gt; Airport has been temporally closed.

No casualties have been reported. So far over 69 people have been injured in Miyagi, &lt;a href="w%3AIwate%20Prefecture"&gt;Iwate&lt;/a&gt;, Fukushima, &lt;a href="w%3ASaitama%20Prefecture"&gt;Saitama&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATokyo"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt; Prefectures including 26 people who have been injured due to falling roof in an indoor swimming pool in Sendai. 687 houses in Tohoku region were destroyed to some extent. In addition, a house by wood in Saitama Prefecture. A female resident was trapped by this broken house and rescued after 50 minutes.

The hijackers of a ship carrying food aid to Somalia have demanded that the food be distributed to people in their home area. 

The ongoing crisis looked to be coming to an end when the WFP said an agreement had been made on 5 August, but the hijackers have told the UN IRIN news service that they have refused to sign the agreement.

Initially the hijackers asked for half a million dollars but have sinced claimed that people in their home communities have been neglected despite being badly affected by the tsunami. 

Food aid to Somalia has been suspended since the hijacking over a month ago.

It has been confirmed that a &lt;a href="w%3ANATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; helicopter of the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Security%20Assistance%20Force"&gt;International Security Assistance Force&lt;/a&gt; has crashed near &lt;a href="w%3AHerat"&gt;Herat&lt;/a&gt;, Western &lt;a href="w%3AAfghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;.

Two &lt;a href="w%3AEurocopter%20Cougar"&gt;Eurocopter Cougar&lt;/a&gt; helicopters were apparently on a training mission for the forthcoming Afghan parliamentary elections when one of the aircraft crashed, killing twelve &lt;a href="w%3ASpain"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; soldiers and five crew members. The second Cougar helicopter made a forced landing which injured five personnel. 

A rescue team from ISAF was sent to the scene, evacuating the dead and wounded to a military hospital in Herat.

It is presently unknown whether the crash was the result of an accident or an attack by the &lt;a href="w%3ATaliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Qaida"&gt;Al Qaida&lt;/a&gt;. 

Initial reports suggest that the crash may have been caused by a sandstorm. A spokesman for the Spanish prime minister told CNN that there were no indications that the chopper was brought down by enemy fire.

Taliban commander Mullah Daldullah claimed to news agency &lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt; that insurgents had shot the helicopter down.

Testimonial from one of the second helicopter soldiers would confirm the attack: "We felt a blast and fell down while turning"
NATO has currently some 8,500 ISAF soldiers stationed in Afghanistan, some 800 of them are Spanish.

It had been reported that the helicopter had experienced techinical problems before takeoff.

A &lt;a href="w%3AColombia"&gt;Colombian&lt;/a&gt; passenger jet carrying 152 passengers and 8 crewmembers has crashed in Western &lt;a href="w%3AVenezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;. Officials said the plane was travelling from &lt;a href="w%3APanama"&gt;Panama&lt;/a&gt;, headed for &lt;a href="w%3AMartinique"&gt;Martinique&lt;/a&gt; in the Caribbean when its pilot reported engine trouble to the &lt;a href="w%3ACaracas"&gt;Caracas&lt;/a&gt; airport just after 3 am (07:00 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;). The pilot reportedly asked for permission to land at &lt;a href="w%3AMaracaibo"&gt;Maracaibo&lt;/a&gt; airport shortly before the plane went missing in the remote state of &lt;a href="w%3AZulia"&gt;Zulia&lt;/a&gt;, close to the Colombian border. Locals have reported hearing explosions near the scene of the crash.

The crashed plane was a 19 year old &lt;a href="w%3AMD-80"&gt;MD-82&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Caribbean%20Airways"&gt;West Caribbean Airways&lt;/a&gt; based in &lt;a href="w%3AMedell%C3%ADn"&gt;Medellín&lt;/a&gt; carrying the registration number HK-4374X. which was delivered only back on 10 January &lt;a href="2005"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; news agency &lt;a href="w%3AAFP"&gt;AFP&lt;/a&gt; reports that all passengers and crew have perished. The crash comes just two days after &lt;a href="w%3AHelios%20Airways%20Flight%20522"&gt;an airplane crash&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AGreece"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;, which killed 121 people.

Documents, reportedly leaked from the investigation into the death of &lt;a href="w%3AJean%20Charles%20de%20Menezes"&gt;Jean Charles de Menezes&lt;/a&gt;, the Brazilian electrician &lt;a href="Armed%20police%20shoot%20man%20dead%20on%20London%20Underground"&gt;shot dead by British Police on the London Underground on 22 July&lt;/a&gt; reveal that Mr de Menezes was not acting suspiciously and was already restrained when shot. 

Furthermore, the documents reveal that the original report given by the police and recorded on the coroners report contained many false statements. The reports suggest the police shot &lt;a href="w%3AJean%20Charles%20de%20Menezes"&gt;Jean Charles de Menezes&lt;/a&gt; because they mistakenly identified him as &lt;a href="w%3AHussain%20Osman"&gt;Hussain Osman&lt;/a&gt;, and had agreed to shoot him if he ran. Hussain Osman was suspected of having placed a faulty or mock explosive in a train.

The original reports claimed that de Menezes was acting suspiciously, was wearing a padded jacket, and ran when challenged, even vaulting the ticket barriers. However, the leaked documents, which include statements from officers involved in the operation and photographs of the scene, show that he behaved like any other commuter, used his travel pass to enter the station, even picking up a newspaper on his way. He was not challenged by police, and appears to have been unaware of being followed until after he entered the train. Photographic stills show he was only wearing a light denim jacket. It appears that he only ran in order to reach a train that was about to leave the platform. 

The leaked document describes CCTV footage, which shows Mr de Menezes entered Stockwell station at a "normal walking pace" and descended slowly on an escalator.

The document said: "At some point near the bottom he is seen to run across the concourse and enter the carriage before sitting in an available seat."

An eye witness, who was sitting opposite de Menezes on the train, is quoted as saying: "Within a few seconds I saw a man coming into the double doors to my left. He was pointing a small black handgun towards a person sitting opposite me. He pointed the gun at the right hand side of the man's head. The gun was within 12 inches of the man's head when the first shot was fired."

This report is considerably different to initial reports that claimed de Menezes tripped as he fled onto the train, before being restrained by pursuing officers and shot. Photographs leaked to ITN appear to corroborate this new witness's report as they clearly show blood on the seat in which de Menezes is said to have been sitting.

Other statements suggest that the Brazilian was seated before being pinned down by a plain-clothed police officer. Plainclothed armed officers had entered the carriage at this point. Several shots were then fired and de Menezes was hit seven times in the head and once in the shoulder. Three further shots missed Mr Menezes.

A community officer's report (one of the leaked documents) confirms that Mr. de Menezes was seated and restrained at the time of being shot:

"I heard shouting which included the word ‘police’ and turned to face the male in the denim jacket.

"He immediately stood up and advanced towards me and the CO19 [the armed unit] officers …I grabbed the male in the denim jacket by wrapping both my arms around his torso, pinning his arms to his side.

"I then pushed him back onto the seat where he had been previously sitting … I then heard a gun shot very close to my left ear and was dragged away onto the floor of the carriage."

The leaked documents confirm that Police had been given permission to shoot if a suspect was non-compliant, having been told that "unusual tactics" may be required and if they "were deployed to intercept a subject and there was an opportunity to challenge, but if the subject was non compliant, a critical shot may be taken." It is thought that when he ran for the train officers felt this was suitable evidence of "non-compliance".

The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said its priority was to keep Mr de Menezes family informed and refused to comment on the details of the leak.

The commission said the family "will clearly be distressed that they have received information on television concerning his death".

In an interview with the Guardian Newspaper, Asad Rehman, spokesman for the family's campaign, called for a public inquiry. "This was not an accident," he said. "It was serious neglect. Clearly, there was a failure both in police intelligence and on an operational level."

Harriet Wistrich, the family's solicitor expressed concerns, during an interview with ITN, that the Police had withheld information from the investigation for a longer period than was permitted under UK law. Ms. Wistrich also claimed, in a separate interview with the BBC, that the documents suggest that the original information given to the pathologist who carried out the post-mortem examination on Mr de Menezes was incorrect and that the information the leaked documents contained was "shocking and terrifying". 

"What sort of society are we living in where we can execute suspects?" she asked in the BBC interview. 

An unnamed senior police source told the Guardian that the leaked documents and statements give an accurate picture of what was known so far about the shooting. Former Flying Squad commander John O'Connor told the BBC "had the normal procedures taken place in which a warning is given and officers wear specially marked clothing then this young man may not have been killed."

The IPCC statement added: "The IPCC made it clear that we would not speculate or release partial information about the investigation, and that others should not do so. That remains the case." 

Mark Oaten, Home Affairs Spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, said: "If true, these preliminary findings will create obvious concerns. It is in the best interests of the police and the community for the full report and any recommendations, to be published as quickly as possible."

<h1>Babies on U.S. no-fly lists holding up passengers/Brief</h1>
Some infants are being prevented from boarding planes at U.S. airports because their names match or resemble those listed on the United States' "no-fly list".

The Transport Safety Administration, which maintains the list, has told airlines that children under twelve should not be stopped from boarding or subjected to additional checks, even if their names are on the list. Despite this, infants whose names register with the "no-fly list" are being impeded at major airports across the nation.

<h1>Plane carrying 160 crashes in Venezuela/Brief</h1>
A Colombian passenger jet carrying 152 passengers and 8 crewmembers has crashed in Western Venezuela. Officials said the plane was travelling from Panama, headed for Martinique in the Caribbean when its pilot reported engine trouble to the Caracas airport shortly after 07:00 UTC time this morning. The pilot reportedly asked for permission to land at Maracaibo airport shortly before the plane went missing in the remote state of Zulia, close to the Colombian border. Locals have reported hearing explosions near the scene of the crash.

The current &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Space%20Station"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt; commander, Russian cosmonaut &lt;a href="w%3ASergei%20Krikalev"&gt;Sergei Krikalev&lt;/a&gt; has set a new record of a total of 748 days spent in orbit &amp;ndash; almost 2 years, as of Tuesday August 16th, 2005. This outstrips the record set by &lt;a href="w%3ASergei%20Avdeyev"&gt;Sergei Avdeyev&lt;/a&gt;'s missions on &lt;a href="w%3AMir"&gt;Mir&lt;/a&gt; station.

Being in space presents many health concerns &amp;ndash; both psychological and physiological difficulties, such as bone loss and radiation exposure. Krikalev's longterm experience of life in space could help to shed light on what physical and mental factors 
will be needed for future long-duration flights &amp;ndash; such as a manned mission to &lt;a href="w%3AMars"&gt;Mars&lt;/a&gt;. University of Texas, Austin psychology researcher David Musson is studying the phenomenon of irritability, fatigue, and lack of sleep which many
space-travellers experience. He hopes to determine which mental traits will help astronauts and cosmonauts deal with or avoid these problems. He also considers Krikalev's experience important for understanding ways to counter the physical side effects of space-travel, stating that "I imagine he's gotten pretty good over time in adhering to a countermeasure programme to minimise bone mass loss".

Krikalev and his American counterpart &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20L.%20Phillips"&gt;John L. Phillips&lt;/a&gt; are due to return to Earth on 7 October 2005, but not before celebrating Krikalev's 47th birthday in orbit. They are also expecting to perform two spacewalks. The first of these &lt;a href="w%3AExtra-vehicular%20activity"&gt;EVAs&lt;/a&gt; is intended to move equipment, install a television camera, and replace experiments.

&lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; television news gave extensive coverage starting around 5:30 PM EST today to a new computer virus, a worm dubbed . Its reporting suggested that it had the potential to become one of the most virulent and costly yet seen. This story was unique among cyber-attacks reports as the network apparently learned of the virus through becoming one of its early victims. Media organizations &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Broadcasting%20Company"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Times"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; were affected as well. Perhaps first-hand experience gave the studio more insight on the virus while providing an early notice. The coverage that followed, however, raises concerns that the network's perspective was skewed, and that perhaps the damage even diminished its reporting ability.

CNN treated the story as a potential global crisis in its manner of coverage as well as in the advice given to viewers. For over 45 minutes, by one viewer's tally, CNN devoted exclusive air-time to this topic. Home users were advised to turn off their computers for safety, while businesses were warned that if continued operations prevented this measure, they were at high risk. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.cnn.com"&gt;CNN.com&lt;/a&gt; sported a bold red headline above its usual content area, warning of the virus. CNN stated they were requesting reports from key sources across the nation, including &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; governor &lt;a href="w%3AArnold%20Schwarzenegger"&gt;Arnold Schwarzenegger&lt;/a&gt;.

After some time, the network eventually obtained a &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; statement describing the virus as "low-impact" and only affecting computers running &lt;a href="w%3AWindows%202000"&gt;Windows 2000&lt;/a&gt;. CNN also learned from Microsoft that there was &lt;a href="http%3A//www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS05-039.mspx"&gt;a patch&lt;/a&gt; available at Microsoft's web site. CNN's coverage contrasted with a lack of actual evidence of widespread infections, in this reporter's view. Much of the discussion and advice came from experts probably not officially associated with CNN, so there is a question of who is at fault.

Chris Carboni of &lt;a href="http%3A//isc.sans.org"&gt;the Internet Storm Center&lt;/a&gt; speculated that "The fact that CNN, ABC and the NYTimes got it may be as simple as reporters from these organizations visiting the same event and connecting to an infected network. While a &lt;a href="w%3Afirewall"&gt;firewall&lt;/a&gt; may have protected their office network up to now, these infected laptops were able to take out the network from the inside once they connected back to it."

&lt;a href="w%3Avassar%20Clements"&gt;Vassar Clements&lt;/a&gt;, age 77, a legendary &lt;a href="w%3Afiddle"&gt;fiddle&lt;/a&gt; player who took bluegrass music from an obscure cultural art form to a mainstream influence, and who played on over 2000 albums, passed away at his &lt;a href="w%3AGoodlettsville%2C%20Tennessee"&gt;Goodlettsville, Tennessee&lt;/a&gt; home August 16th 2005 at 8:35 am &lt;a href="w%3ANashville"&gt;Nashville&lt;/a&gt; time (CST) from lung cancer which had metastasized to his liver and brain. 

Mr. Clements taught himself to play the fiddle at age 7, and though he had no formal training was recognized as one of the world's most versatile fiddle players and was considered a virtuoso. The first song he learned was "There's an Old Spinning Wheel in the Parlor". He described his talent saying, "It was God's gift, something born in me. I was too dumb to learn it any other way. I listened to the (Grand Ole) Opry some. I'd pick it up one note at a time. I was young, with plenty of time and I didn't give up. You'd come home from school, do your lessons and that's it. No other distractions. I don't read music. I play what I hear." 

He didn't always earn his living playing music, though. In the mid-1960s he was employed briefly at the &lt;a href="w%3AKennedy%20Space%20Center"&gt;Kennedy Space Center&lt;/a&gt; in Florida, where he worked on plumbing. He also performed several other blue-collar jobs including work in a Georgia paper mill, as switchman for Atlantic Coast Railroad; he even sold insurance and once owned a potato chip franchise. 

In his 50 year career he played with artists ranging from &lt;a href="w%3AWoody%20Herman"&gt;Woody Herman&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="w%3ANitty%20Gritty%20Dirt%20Band"&gt;Nitty Gritty Dirt Band&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Grateful%20Dead"&gt;The Grateful Dead&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALinda%20Ronstadt"&gt;Linda Ronstadt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20McCartney"&gt;Paul McCartney&lt;/a&gt;, and earned at least five &lt;a href="w%3AGrammy"&gt;Grammy&lt;/a&gt; nominations and numerous professional accolades. He once recorded with the pop group &lt;a href="w%3Athe%20Monkees"&gt;the Monkees&lt;/a&gt; by happenstance, when he stayed behind after an earlier recording session. He also appeared in &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Altman"&gt;Robert Altman&lt;/a&gt;'s 1975 film "Nashville". 

His 2005 Grammy award for best country instrumental performance was for "Earl's Breakdown," by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, and featured Mr. Clements, &lt;a href="w%3AEarl%20Scruggs"&gt;Earl Scruggs&lt;/a&gt;, Randy Scruggs and &lt;a href="w%3AJerry%20Douglas"&gt;Jerry Douglas&lt;/a&gt;.

Mr. Clements, whose last performance was February 4 in Jamestown, N.Y., was hospitalized earlier this year for 18 days to receive chemotherapy and other treatment. He had been diagnosed in March 2005. 

Born in Kinard, South Carolina, his musical career began at age 14 when he associated with Bill Monroe, and later officially joined the Blue Grass Boys band where he remained for seven years. In 1957 he joined bluegrass band Jim &amp; Jesse McReynolds where he remained until 1962. In 1967 he returned to Nashville where he became a much sought after studio musician. 

After a brief touring stint with &lt;a href="w%3AFaron%20Young"&gt;Faron Young&lt;/a&gt; he joined &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Hartford"&gt;John Hartford&lt;/a&gt;'s Dobrolic Plectral Society in 1971 when he met guitarist &lt;a href="w%3ANorman%20Blake"&gt;Norman Blake&lt;/a&gt; and Dobro player Tut Taylor, and recorded ♡❤Aereo Plain♡❤, a widely acclaimed newgrass album that helped broaden the bluegrass market and sound. After less than a year he joined Earl Scruggs, who first earned widespread renown for playing the theme to sitcom ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Beverly%20Hillbillies"&gt;The Beverly Hillbillies&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. 

His 1972 work with the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band on their album ♡❤Will the Circle Be Unbroken♡❤ earned him even wider acclaim, and later worked with the Grateful Dead's ♡❤Wake of the Flood♡❤ and &lt;a href="w%3AJimmy%20Buffett"&gt;Jimmy Buffett&lt;/a&gt;'s ♡❤A White Sport Coat and a Pink Crustacean♡❤.

Though he played numerous instruments, Mr. Clements indicated that he chose the fiddle over guitar recalling that, "I picked up a guitar and fiddle and tried them both out. The guitar was pretty easy, but I couldn't get nothing out of the fiddle. So every time I'd see those instruments sitting side by side, I'd grab that fiddle."

&lt;a href="w%3ABig%20band"&gt;Big band&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aswing%20music"&gt;swing music&lt;/a&gt; were considerable influences upon his style and musical development, and he said that, “Bands like &lt;a href="w%3AGlenn%20Miller"&gt;Glenn Miller&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALes%20Brown"&gt;Les Brown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATommy%20Dorsey"&gt;Tommy Dorsey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHarry%20James"&gt;Harry James&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AArtie%20Shaw"&gt;Artie Shaw&lt;/a&gt; were very popular when I was a kid. I always loved rhythm, so I guess in the back of my mind the swing and jazz subconsciously comes out when I play, because when I was learning I was always trying to emulate the big-band sounds I heard on my fiddle.” 

His last album 'Livin' With the Blues', released in 2004, featured guest appearances by &lt;a href="w%3AElvin%20Bishop"&gt;Elvin Bishop&lt;/a&gt;, Norton Buffalo, &lt;a href="w%3AMaria%20Muldaur"&gt;Maria Muldaur&lt;/a&gt; and others. 

Mr. Clements' daughter Midge Cranor wrote on his website &lt;a href="http%3A//www.vassarclements.com/new.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that "As I was still holding his hand his breathing stopped. I looked at the clock and it was 7:20 am."

Mr. Clements' remains have been transported to Bond Memorial Chapel, 1098 Weston Drive, Mt. Juliet, TN 37122; (615) 773-2663.

<h1>Taizé ecumenical community founder Frère Roger assassinated</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Taiz%C3%A9%20ecumenical%20community%20founder%20Fr%C3%A8re%20Roger%20assassinated&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
90 year old &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARoger%20Louis%20Schutz-Marsauche"&gt;Frère Roger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who founded the international ecumenical community of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATaiz%C3%A9%20community"&gt;Taizé&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , was killed today after a knife attack during evening prayers at the community's church. 

According to media coverage, a mentally disturbed woman, supposedly a 36 year old from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARomania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , is responsible for the attack. 

Members of the community have said that at the evening prayer, during the first song, the woman joined the kids who sit with Frère Roger at these services. Then, at about 20:45 CET, she stabbed him with a knife or similar weapon, sources say. The founder of Taizé, who was sitting in a wheelchair, was carried out of the service still bleeding. 

One of the brothers of Taizé, a medical doctor, together with another doctor who was present at the evening service, tried to save the life of Taizé's founder, but didn't succeed and Frère Roger died just minutes after the knife attack. 

The community have reacted to the shocking events in their own way. While sisters tended to the guests who had been direct eye witnesses, young people took the seats the brothers had left. While a part of the church was blocked off, the evening prayer continued with the Taizé liturgy.

Anti-virus software publisher &lt;a href="w%3ASymantec"&gt;Symantec&lt;/a&gt; has reported that outbreaks of two varieties of &lt;a href="w%3Acomputer%20worm"&gt;worm&lt;/a&gt; are imminent following system failures on two unnamed major corporate networks in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. After receiving several eyewitness accounts from on-site personnel this reporter noted similarities to the &lt;a href="w%3AMSBlast"&gt;MSBlast&lt;/a&gt; worm which made headline news two years ago (on the 16th of July 2003) after causing massive outages. 

The worms are limited to Microsoft Windows products based on the NT architecture such as &lt;a href="w%3AWindows%202000"&gt;Windows 2000&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3AWindows%20XP"&gt;Windows XP&lt;/a&gt;, exploiting administrator services applets which shut a computer down when a certain service fails. The worms cause these "administrator services" to fail, provoking the computer into shutting down immediately. 

Microsoft has announced that a critical update is available for all users, even
for those who use pirated versions of Windows.

Chrysler, Kraft Foods and many other US corporations are feeling the brunt of the attack as the US was in the middle of the work day when new more virulent variants emerged.

<h1>Israeli Army begins forced evacuation of Gaza settlements</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Israeli%20Army%20begins%20forced%20evacuation%20of%20Gaza%20settlements&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AIsraeli%20Defence%20Forces"&gt;Israeli army&lt;/a&gt; has begun to forcibly remove settlers in &lt;a href="w%3AGaza%20Strip"&gt;Gaza Strip&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;a href="Gaza%20Strip%20pullout%20under%20way"&gt;deadline for voluntary evacuation&lt;/a&gt; passed at 00:00, local time, this morning (21:00 UTC Tuesday).

Soldiers entered the settlements of &lt;a href="w%3ANeve%20Dekalim"&gt;Neve Dekalim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMorag"&gt;Morag&lt;/a&gt;, Ganei Tal, and Bedolah in the early morning hours and have begun to carry settlers away. In Neve Dekalim over 1,000 settlers shut themselves inside the local synagogue while others did the same in their houses. In Morag a bulldozer was needed to break through a barricade constructed of trash containers. A soldier there was lightly wounded when a protester stabbed her in the arm with a needle. Prime minister &lt;a href="w%3AAriel%20Sharon"&gt;Ariel Sharon&lt;/a&gt; responded to the incident by saying "don't hurt them, hurt me". In Southern Israel a woman is in critical condition after she set herself on fire in protest over the evacuations.

The army claims more than half of the 8,500 settlers in the Strip have already left. However, those remaining vowed to stay as long as they can, telling the soldiers that they "should be ashamed at what [they] are doing".

A thin majority in the Israeli government believe the pullout from Gaza is vital for the security of the country. "I look with hope to the future, that the price we are paying [...] will in the end bring about a positive change in Israel's situation," said Defense Minister &lt;a href="w%3AShaul%20Mofaz"&gt;Shaul Mofaz&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3APalestinian%20Authority"&gt;Palestinian Authority&lt;/a&gt; welcomes the withdrawal from Gaza but believes it can only be a first step in the process of giving up all Israeli settlements, including in the &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Bank"&gt;West Bank&lt;/a&gt;.

Meanwhile, an Israeli settler from Shiloh, in the West Bank, killed four Palestinians and wounded another two when he opened fire in an industrial area of the settlement. The 38-year old reportedly stole the gun used in the shooting from a security guard. He was arrested. &lt;a href="w%3AHamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt; has vowed to avenge the killings.

Hamdi Issac, a suspect in the 21 July bombings in &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, has been ordered by an Italian court to return to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;. 

The Ethiopian national was arrested in &lt;a href="w%3ARome"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt; a few days after the July 21 failed terror attacks in London.

Despite today's decision by Rome's appeal court, Issac's attorneys are expected to immediately appeal, delaying his extradition by up to a month.

In Crawford, Texas, anti-war protesters led by American Cindy Sheehan, &lt;a href="Mother%27s%20plea%20to%20U.S.%20president%20gains%20widespread%20attention"&gt;mother of a fallen soldier&lt;/a&gt;, have found a new place to demonstrate. "A kind gentleman from down the road, closer to the Bush ranch, has offered us the use of his property," said Sheehan to the reporters, as the camp prepared a move to private land.

The property owner, U.S. Army veteran Fred Mattlage, said, "I just think people should have a right to protest without being harassed, and I'm against the war. I don't think it's a war we need to be in."

Sheehan continued to tell the reporters, "He offered it because he heard about the shots fired at us the other day and he didn't think that was right. He happens to be the third cousin of the person that fired the shots and so he came down and he said he supports us 100 percent."

The "shots fired" were those of nearby resident Larry Mattlage, whose land borders the protesters at their current location. After complaining about the proximity of the protesters, he fired a shotgun twice into the air Sunday - in order to prepare for duck hunting season, he said. Mattlage says at no time was he ever threatening the protesters with his shots.

Not all Americans agree with Mrs. Sheehan's position. On Monday, a man was arrested and charged with vandalism of Camp Casey's memorial for troops lost in Iraq. Around 10pm the previous night, authorities say the accused used his pickup truck to run over hundreds of small wooden crosses bearing names of U.S. soldiers killed in Iraq.

In comments to the press, Bush offered sympathy to Sheehan, "I sympathize with Mrs. Sheehan. She feels strongly about her -- about her position. And she has every right in the world to say what she believes.", he said. However, he has still declined to meet her. "I think it's important for me to be thoughtful and sensitive to those who have got something to say." Bush told reporters, "But, I think it's also important for me to go on with my life, to keep a balanced life."

Others have commented that Sheehan is being used by those with their own agendas, "What started out as a grieving mom that we all sympathized with has now turned into ... an orchestrated far-left campaign," commented Greg Mueller, a conservative public-relations executive.

A former FBI special agent, Rowley, and Becky Lourey, whose son was killed in Iraq, will leave for Texas on Thursday and camp at the site for a few days.

Rowley said, "It puts a human face on this issue; many people, if they don't have a personal connection to the troops, it's so easy for this to become a discussion that lacks seriousness and urgency. I think it's good to show that there are real people that are being affected."

"Our children are dying and I think it's time to go support Cindy and see if Bush will come out and we can say, 'President Bush, what is the mission exactly?'," Becky Lourey added. "Truth has been shifting all around and I think we need to rejoin the world community and not occupy another nation." Lourey said.

Sheehan wants the withdrawal of all troops from Iraq. President Bush claims that leaving Iraq now wouldn't be helpful for Iraqis or Americans, but only for terrorists.

The average retail price of gasoline in Canada surpassed the psychological barrier of &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20dollar"&gt;CAN $&lt;/a&gt;1 (US$0.84) per &lt;a href="w%3Alitre"&gt;litre&lt;/a&gt; during the past week, according to the &lt;a href="w%3ACalgary"&gt;Calgary&lt;/a&gt; firm &lt;a href="w%3AM.J.%20Ervin%20%26amp%3B%20Associates"&gt;M.J. Ervin &amp; Associates&lt;/a&gt;.

According to Ervin, the average price for a litre (.26 gallon) of regular unleaded gasoline is now C$1.04 (US$0.87, €0.71)

Fuel remains under a dollar a litre in some parts of the country, with retailers in &lt;a href="w%3AEdmonton%2C%20Alberta"&gt;Edmonton&lt;/a&gt; offering the cheapest prices of all the major cities at 93.3 cents/litre. Drivers in &lt;a href="w%3AMontreal"&gt;Montreal&lt;/a&gt; were paying $1.14/litre, the highest price in the country.

The surging price of crude oil has been cited by Ervin as the reason for the unprecedented prices. Rising demand coupled by ongoing political problems in the &lt;a href="w%3AMiddle%20East"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt; have pushed crude prices to new records at the close of each day of trading. The price at the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Mercantile%20Exchange"&gt;New York Mercantile Exchange&lt;/a&gt; is now averaging over US$65 per barrel, a full $20 a barrel higher than one year ago.

"The biggest factor playing into the current pump price is, without a doubt, the high crude oil prices," according to Ervin's Cathy Hay. But she added, "Layering in on top of that is very strong gasoline demand and a decline in inventories."

Hay's remarks echo the view of many analysts that despite the record prices, there is not yet any sign of major changes in Canadians' driving habits. 

"(Canadians) will basically grin and bear it. Well, maybe they won't grin, but they'll bear it." &lt;a href="w%3ABank%20of%20Montreal"&gt;Bank of Montreal&lt;/a&gt; economist Doug Porter said. "So far we really haven't seen any response whatsoever on the consumer spending front."

The rising fuel prices have prompted the country's major airlines, &lt;a href="w%3AAir%20Canada"&gt;Air Canada&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AWestJet"&gt;WestJet&lt;/a&gt; to levy fuel surcharges. Analysts expect the rising fuel costs to trigger a rise in the price of many goods and services as shipping costs rise. Concerns regarding the long-term effect of higher fuel prices are prompting demands by the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Taxpayers%20Federation"&gt;Canadian Taxpayers Federation&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Automobile%20Association"&gt;Canadian Automobile Association&lt;/a&gt; and others that the federal and provincial governments either lower or eliminate gasoline taxes.

&lt;a href="w%3ANova%20Scotia"&gt;Nova Scotian&lt;/a&gt; Finance Minister &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Christie"&gt;Peter Christie&lt;/a&gt; is considering such requests, although he emphasized that such steps would not be taken quickly. Nova Scotian &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Nova%20Scotia"&gt;New Democrat&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href="w%3ADarrell%20Dexter"&gt;Darrell Dexter&lt;/a&gt; said the province's &lt;a href="w%3AHarmonized%20Sales%20Tax"&gt;Harmonized Sales Tax&lt;/a&gt; should be removed from gasoline, asserting that since there are already both federal and provincial excise taxes on fuel, it is therefore immoral to charge what is effectively a double tax by adding HST (or the Goods and Services Tax and provincial sales taxes outside Atlantic Canada).

However, federal cabinet ministers were quick to reject calls to lower the federal excise tax to exempt GST. Federal &lt;a href="w%3ANatural%20Resources%20Minister%20%28Canada%29"&gt;Natural Resources Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Efford"&gt;John Efford&lt;/a&gt; said the price of gasoline was being driven up by demand for crude oil, not taxes.

Several cities and towns in Bangladesh have been rocked by around 459 small explosions occurring simultaneously. To date at least 125 people have been injured and two people have been killed. The two people killed were a bicycle rickshaw driver in the northern town of Chapainawabganj and a 10-year-old boy in the central town of Savar.

The attacks are being blamed on the Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen group. Leaflets bearing the Islamic group’s message were found near many of the homemade bombs. The group is said to want to establish an Islamic state in place of current secular laws. 

The bombs were apparently made to cause limited damage. The explosives were packed in small containers and wrapped in tape, paper or sawdust. Explosives created for high collateral damage would typically contain nails or other items that could be used as shrapnel.

Bangladesh currently has the world's third largest Muslim population in the world. The Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen was banned in February after a series of bombings against non-governmental groups including holy shrines and other targets.

"Total chaos" is how many described the melee that resulted from a sale of used &lt;a href="w%3AApple%20Computer"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AiBook"&gt;iBook&lt;/a&gt; laptop computers at the Richmond International Raceway (RIR) by the &lt;a href="w%3AHenrico%20County%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Henrico County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Virginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; school system. 

Officials estimated nearly 5,000 people thronged the sale for the $50, four-year-old computers. Among them were 17 injured, four requiring hospitalization - one for a leg injury, and three for heat-related illness, said Henrico County Police. Reports of trampling in the stampede were not uncommon, and one driver reportedly tried to drive through the throng of prospective buyers. 

Alice Jemerson, an elderly customer said, "They bum rushed the gates and I was knocked over, fighting for my life. All these people were on top of me."

Shortly after 7am EST officials opened the gates and many residents ran hysterically toward the building where the sale was to occur at 9am. 

At a post sale press conference, Henrico County Police spokesman Lieutenant Doug Perry told reporters, "A few bad apples found their way inside. It looked worse than it was."
Apple iBooks are the preferred computer for Henrico County schools, and Director of General Services of Henrico County Paul Proto, said changes were made to the event after tremendous interest was generated, some as far away as Europe and California. Officials closed and moved the sale from the Henrico county school warehouse to the RIR, after residents complained that their tax dollars were used to buy the computers, and they ought to have first right to repurchase them. The Henrico County Board of Supervisors voted to amend the County Code so that only residents could purchase the laptop computers. 

Although officials had prohibited camping out and overnight parking, some in attendance reported that people began arriving at midnight. 

Henrico Police Chief H.W. Stanley, Jr. said five patrol officers were originally planned for the event, a customary presence for an event the size authorities had estimated. But by 6 am, an enormous crowd was assembled at the front gate. 

Officials present before opening told the crowd that automobiles would be allowed to enter first, which prompted many to run to their cars. But while some were running back to their cars, others rushed the gate. The resulting confusion created much anger, and guards closed the gates shortly thereafter. 

Long lines encircling the sale building were commonplace, and one observer noted, "They're going to see themselves on the news tonight, and see what fools they are."

Some citizens, however, considered their wait worthwhile. Hairstylist and mother of two Sheress Blunt was one of the first hundred to buy one of the iBooks; she came with her mother and said they sneaked into the raceway through a side gate. 

Tonya Vaughan arrived at 5:30 a.m., also bought one of the first iBooks and said three people offered to buy it from her for as much as $200. She declined however, saying, "I told them no way! I had worked too hard for it."

Lt. Perry said many officers were complimented on the way they handled the crowd, adding that police were seen letting children who had been pushed aside, into the building. 

Mr. Proto said, "There are no plans right now to have another iBook sale." 

Henrico County Battalion Police Chief Steve Wood said no arrests were made and the iBooks were sold out by 1pm EST.

A robotic system at Stanford Medical Center was used to perform a &lt;a href="w%3Alaparoscopic"&gt;laparoscopic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Agastric%20bypass%20surgery"&gt;gastric bypass surgery&lt;/a&gt; successfully with a theoretically similar rate of complications to that seen in standard operations. However, as there were only 10 people in the experimental group (and another 10 in the control group), this is not a statistically significant sample. 

If this surgical procedure is as successful in large-scale studies, it may lead the way for the use of robotic surgery in even more delicate procedures, such as &lt;a href="w%3Aheart%20surgery"&gt;heart surgery&lt;/a&gt;. Note that this is not a fully automated system, as a human doctor controls the operation via remote control. Laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery is a treatment for obesity.

There were concerns that doctors, in the future, might only be trained in the remote control procedure. Ronald G. Latimer, M.D., of Santa Barbara, CA, warned "The fact that surgeons may have to open the patient or might actually need to revert to standard laparoscopic techniques demands that this basic training be a requirement before a robot is purchased. Robots do malfunction, so a backup system is imperative. We should not be seduced to buy this instrument to train surgeons if they are not able to do the primary operations themselves." 

There are precedents for just such a problem occurring. A previous "new technology", the &lt;a href="w%3Aelectrocardiogram"&gt;electrocardiogram&lt;/a&gt; (ECG), has lead to a lack of basic education on the older technology, the &lt;a href="w%3Astethoscope"&gt;stethoscope&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, many heart conditions now go undiagnosed, especially in children and others who rarely undergo an ECG procedure.

Two new schools have opened in the &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Ossetia-Alania"&gt;North Ossetian&lt;/a&gt; town of &lt;a href="w%3ABeslan"&gt;Beslan&lt;/a&gt; to replace ♡❤School Number One♡❤ that was destroyed in the &lt;a href="w%3ABeslan%20school%20siege"&gt;Beslan school siege&lt;/a&gt;.

The mayor of &lt;a href="w%3AMoscow"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AYuri%20Luzhkov"&gt;Yuri Luzhkov&lt;/a&gt;, attended the opening ceremony and symbolically handed over the keys to the buildings to the school directors. He said the construction of the schools is part of a general plan to help rebuild Beslan and hoped that "children go to school with a feeling that will help them in life in the future".

The construction was financed by the &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; government. The two schools, totalling 36,000 square meters, will house 600 pupils each. The first day of school in the new buildings will be on September 5th, 2005.

Beslan's ♡❤School Number One♡❤ was seized by terrorists in September 2004. The 3-day standoff claimed the lifes of 344 people, 172 of them children.

The bodies of over 1,000 civilians were brought to &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad's&lt;/a&gt; morgue last month, the highest recorded death toll for &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq's&lt;/a&gt; capital since the invasion began in &lt;a href="w%3AMarch%202003"&gt;March 2003&lt;/a&gt;.

Amid preparations for the new Iraqi constitution, the &lt;a href="w%3AInterim%20Government%20of%20Iraq"&gt;Interim Government&lt;/a&gt; has tried to suppress details of the growing number of civilian casualties, but the truth emerged after British veteran journalist &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Fisk"&gt;Robert Fisk&lt;/a&gt; paid a visit to the morgue and was shown the human cost of Iraq's security crisis:

'The July figures are the largest ever recorded in the history of the Baghdad Medical Institute,' one of the senior managers at the morgue said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

An estimated 1,100 bodies were received by the Baghdad mortuary in July, a rise of 85% compared with figures for the same month before the US-led invasion. The latest figures show a rising trend: in 2004 and 2003 the numbers in July were 800 and 700 respectively. By comparison, equivalent figures for 1997, 1998 and 1999 were all below 200.

All of last month's dead are civilians, the majority male and most aged between 15-44. Fisk, writing in &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Independent"&gt;The Independent&lt;/a&gt;, described how the task of identifying all of the bodies has been complicated because many have been tortured or otherwise disfigured. 'In many cases, the remains have been shattered by explosions &amp;mdash; possibly by suicide bombs &amp;mdash; or by deliberate disfigurement by their killers,' he wrote.

The medical authorities have buried 500 nameless bodies since January.

Two men were severely hurt in a transformer explosion around 1500h local time at a popular Toronto fairground. 

The explosion occurred during preparations for the opening of the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE), the largest fair of its kind in Canada.

The cause of the explosion is unknown and the unidentified men are both in hospital with life-threatening injuries.

Prosecuters say Tobin conspired with state GOP official &lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Mcgee"&gt;Charles Mcgee&lt;/a&gt; and consultant &lt;a href="w%3AAllen%20Raymond"&gt;Allen Raymond&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AVirginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, both of whom are cooperating with prosecutors, to have the consultant's telephone firm make repeated hang-up calls to Democratic and labor union get-out-the-vote phone banks, effectively jamming their phone lines. The New Hampshire Republican State Committee paid $15,600 to the firm. Callers requesting transportation to polling places were thus unable to receive any, allege prosecutors.

Republican &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20E.%20Sununu"&gt;John Sunonu&lt;/a&gt; won a close &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;US Senate&lt;/a&gt; race in New Hampshire following the phone-jammings which occurred in November 2002.

The &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20National%20Committee"&gt;RNC&lt;/a&gt; has been paying Tobin's legal fees, which have so far amounted to $722,382. The RNC did not specify that the payments were for Tobin's defense in reports with the FEC, but has since confirmed that they were. RNC Chairperson &lt;a href="w%3AKen%20Mehlman"&gt;Ken Mehlman&lt;/a&gt; said in a May 18, 2005 statement that he "strongly support[ed]" a "zero-tolerance policy" on election fraud.&lt;a href="http%3A//wid.ap.org/documents/rncletter.pdf"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Some have therefore criticized the GOP for making the payments to the powerful Williams and Connolly law firm. But on August 10, 2005, RNC spokesperson &lt;a href="w%3ATracey%20Schmitt"&gt;Tracey Schmitt&lt;/a&gt; said their support of Tobin through payment of his legal fees is "based on his assurance and our belief that Jim has not engaged in any wrongdoing."&lt;a href="http%3A//www.theunionleader.com/articles_showfast.html%3Farticle%3D59053"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Tobin's involvement is said to have been finding the firm to make the calls. Raymond told prosecutors Tobin explained the scheme to him and asked him to implement it, and his lawyers said that he had believed Tobin was acting under RNC sanction in his then capacity as policial director for New England. Tobin went on to work for the president's re-election campaign.

&lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Twomey"&gt;Paul Tworney&lt;/a&gt;, a volunteer lawyer for New Hampshire Democrats said the RNC's actions suggested more people may be involved. "It originally appeared to us that there were just certain rogue elements of the Republican Party who were willing to do anything to win control of the U.S. Senate, including depriving Americans of their ability to vote. But now that the RNC actually is bankrolling Mr. Tobin's defense, coupled with the fact that it has refused some discovery in the civil case, really raises the questions of who are they protecting, how high does this go and who was in on this," said Twoney.&lt;a href="http%3A//www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi%3Ffile%3D/n/a/2005/08/10/national/w231835D50.DTL"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairperson &lt;a href="w%3AKathy%20Sullivan"&gt;Kathy Sullivan&lt;/a&gt; demanded that the state Republican Chairperson &lt;a href="w%3AWarren%20Henderson"&gt;Warren Henderson&lt;/a&gt; resign.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Multiple%20computer%20worms%20released%20as%20%26quot%3Bbotwar%26quot%3B%20rages&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Security experts are calling it a "botwar". Multiple &lt;a href="w%3Acomputer%20worms"&gt;computer worms&lt;/a&gt;, with payloads that turn infected computers into sources of &lt;a href="w%3Aspam"&gt;spam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Aviruses"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt; and security attacks, are being released by at least two separate groups. Now newer versions of one group's worm include the ability to disable earlier versions of the other group's infection. "The W32/Zotob-F worms (also known as Bozori) attempts to remove infections by earlier versions of the &lt;a href="w%3AZotob"&gt;Zotob&lt;/a&gt; worm and other malware, so it can take control of the compromised computer for itself", a Sophos news item stated. F-secure's Weblog confirmed this and added "It seems there are two groups that are fighting: IRCBot and Bozori vs Zotobs and the other Bots."

Gregg Keizer of TechWeb News draws parallels between the current events and a prior example of criminal activity; "The most notable back-and-forth between [virus and worm writers] was in early 2004, when the writers of the &lt;a href="w%3ABagle"&gt;Bagle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANetsky"&gt;Netsky&lt;/a&gt; worm families engaged in a long-running tit-for-tat exchange where each tried to delete the other's code. The battle led to a veritable flood of malicious code that [lasted] weeks." While some see a repeat of those events, other experts indicate that the current situation is "business as normal" for the criminals that create these "&lt;a href="w%3ABotnet"&gt;bot networks&lt;/a&gt;".

A statement from &lt;a href="w%3AKaspersky"&gt;Kaspersky&lt;/a&gt; Lab stated that confusion over the naming of the worms has combined with overzealous reporting by infected news organisations to create confusion as to the magnitude of the attack. At this stage they are not calling it an epidemic.

All of these worms currently exploit the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms05-039.mspx"&gt;MS05-039 Plug and Play vulnerability&lt;/a&gt;, for which a patch has already been released.

Abdelmajid Bouchar, a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A11%20March%202004%20Madrid%20train%20bombings"&gt;March 2004 Madrid terrorist attack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; suspect, was arrested in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABelgrade"&gt;Belgrade&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Serbia%20and%20Montenegro"&gt;Serbia and Montenegro&lt;/a&gt;, the Ministry for Internal Affairs said yesterday.

He was arrested on June 23rd after he allegedly presented forged Iraqi identity documentation with a name "Midhat Salah" during a routine check by Serbian police. He is currently held in a prison in Padinska skela, near Belgrade.

Spanish interior minister, Jose Antonio Alonso, said &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; will seek extradition. The man is accused of presenting false documents and immigration violations and is currently being held in Serbia. 

The &lt;a href="Interpol"&gt;Interpol&lt;/a&gt; office in Madrid confirmed identity based on fingerprints.

Recent images from the &lt;a href="w%3AChandra%20X-Ray%20Observatory"&gt;Chandra X-Ray Observatory&lt;/a&gt; reveal details of the nature of the star that became &lt;a href="w%3ASN%201987A"&gt;Supernova 1987A&lt;/a&gt;. In the time just before the star exploded, solar winds created a cavity in a cloud of cool gas that surrounded it. The explosion first lit up the cooler gas with a burst of ultraviolet light, then created a shock wave that started travelling through this cavity.

"In 1999, Chandra imaged this shock wave, and astronomers have waited expectantly for the shock wave to hit the edge of the cavity, where it would encounter the much denser gas deposited by the red supergiant wind, and produce a dramatic increase in X-radiation. The latest data from Chandra and the &lt;a href="w%3AHubble%20Space%20Telescope"&gt;Hubble Space Telescope&lt;/a&gt; indicate that this much-anticipated event has begun." an article on the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics' Chandra website states.

These events confirm scientists' understanding of stars. As the shock wave continues it will travel through less understood material, hopefully allowing scientists to further their research into the birth and death of stars, and the overall behaviour of the universe.

Pope &lt;a href="w%3ABenedict%20XVI"&gt;Benedict XVI&lt;/a&gt; has arrived in &lt;a href="w%3ACologne"&gt;Cologne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Youth%20Day%202005"&gt;World Youth Day 2005&lt;/a&gt;, a Catholic festival. It is the new Pope's first foreign trip. His plane landed at 12 am (UTC+2) at &lt;a href="w%3ACologne%20Bonn%20Airport"&gt;Cologne/Bonn Airport&lt;/a&gt;. He was greeted by German president &lt;a href="w%3AHorst%20K%C3%B6hler"&gt;Horst Köhler&lt;/a&gt;, chancellor &lt;a href="w%3AGerhard%20Schr%C3%B6der"&gt;Gerhard Schröder&lt;/a&gt; and a cheering crowd. Later, the Pope boarded a cruise ship and sailed downstream the &lt;a href="w%3ARhine"&gt;Rhine&lt;/a&gt;, with hundreds of thousands of people cheering at the riverbanks. He addressed the crowd from the ship and said he feels great to see so many young people from countless countries and hopes they can "have a moving experience of prayer as dialogue with God". 

The four-day event began on Tuesday and will conclude with a big open-air mass on Sunday. Up to 1 milion people are expected there. 

While in Cologne, Benedict XVI will visit a synagogue and meet representatives from various religious groups, including members of the Muslim community.

Security guards at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Parliament%20House"&gt;Parliament House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACanberra%2C%20Australia"&gt;Canberra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have been advised by internal memo not to use the word '&lt;a href="wikt%3Amate"&gt;mate&lt;/a&gt;' when communicating with the public.

The Speaker of the &lt;a href="Australian%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; has been asked to look into the directive after it was rumoured that a member of &lt;a href="Australian%20Parliament"&gt;Parliament&lt;/a&gt; or a senior public servant complained about use of the common &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n term.

The Secretary for the Department of Parliamentary Services said on ABC TV: "There was a feeling that they perhaps just needed a reminder that some informality, while it may be appropriate for some people, it may not suit all our visitors."

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Australian Labor Party MP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Tanya Plibersek said the ban was un-Australian. "I can't tell you how offended I am by this," he said, while reaction from the Liberals and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;Nationals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was mixed.

"I think that people should get off their high horse and take a reality check," said Liberal backbencher Bob Baldwin, who believes the word should be treated as a badge of honour. "I have never seen anything so criminal in all my life. It's part of the Australian vernacular. It's a term of endearment and of mateship."

Nationals MP Paul Neville said "If they want to call me mate or buddy or something like that, I'm not the least bit offended."

A 17-year old Syrian-born youth was killed and his 19-year old brother seriously injured on Thursday by a bomb they are suspected of having been building in their &lt;a href="w%3AOslo"&gt;Oslo&lt;/a&gt; flat. Several youths were being questioned by the &lt;a href="w%3Apolice"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; for suspected involvement.

The 19-year old brother is described as being in stable condition.
Two women and one man, present but not injured when the suspected bomb exploded, are being questioned by investigators.

Police said they found instructions on making bombs downloaded from the internet at the scene. "At the scene we found written instructions on how to make explosives and some powder that the youngsters had mixed," said police inspector Vidar Hjulstad speaking to Norwegian public radio &lt;a href="w%3ANorsk%20Rikskringkasting"&gt;NRK&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http%3A//news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4162398.stm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

A 20-year old Pakistani-born friend has been charged with illegal handling of expolosives and is being questioned by police.

The 17-year old has a large criminal record including 17 car thefts, threats, robbing a store, drug abuse and violence against a civil servant. He had reportedly been studying chemistry at Sofienberg Technical College.

Police said the target of the bombs might have been ticket machines on the Oslo transportation system, with the purpose of stealing the money they contain. "It looks most like [the dead 17-year old] had made the explosives to blow up ticket machines on the Oslo transport system," said Oslo assistant chief of police Terje Kristiansen. He said a ticket machine in Oslo had recently been blown up. Police say they do not suspect any tie to Islamic extremism and Kristiansen said, "It looks like personal gain was the main cause."&lt;a href="http%3A//www.signonsandiego.com/news/world/20050818-1024-norway-blast.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

A couple living near by anonymously said they had previously reported bomb-making activity at the apartment to police but had been ignored. They said ten people in total were involved in making bombs at the Oslo flat. "This is not the first explosion. We have heard many bangs and smelled lead or gunpowder afterwards," the couple told ♡❤Dagsavisen♡❤ newspaper.&lt;a href="http%3A//www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article1099519.ece"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Kristiansen said he was not aware of their reports.

The entire apartment building has been evacuated as police investigate. They are said to be evaluating the risk of another accidental blast.

A new report indicates that while &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;'s economy remains in a shambles and the prospect of future growth is still dim, Iraqi citizens do enjoy some of the least expensive gas prices in the world. 

The &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Monetary%20Fund"&gt;International Monetary Fund&lt;/a&gt; says Iraqi drivers currently pay an average of 5 U.S. cents a gallon (1.32¢/L) for gasoline. This contrasts to averages of $2.55 (67.4¢/L) in the United States and $6.24 ($1.65/L) in Great Britain. Even neighboring Iran pays more at the pump than Iraq; 38 cents a gallon (10.0¢/L).

The low cost is due in large part to generous pre-war government subsidies on petroleum products that remain in place today.

In its report, the IMF warned the subsidies are a threat to economic growth in the country. The country still suffers near daily insurgent attacks, high unemployement, inflation, and frequent electrical, water, and sewage service disruptions.

Meanwhile, Iraqi &lt;a href="w%3APetroleum"&gt;oil&lt;/a&gt; output continues to recover. Prior to &lt;a href="w%3AOperation%20Iraqi%20Freedom"&gt;Operation Iraqi Freedom&lt;/a&gt;, Iraq's daily output of crude was 2.5 million barrels a day. This week, oil production is 1.6 million barrels per day. Iraq's oil reserves are estimated at nearly 115 billion barrels, the third largest in the world.

&lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; has revealed prices for the &lt;a href="w%3AXbox%20360"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt;, its new &lt;a href="w%3Agames%20console"&gt;games console&lt;/a&gt; which goes on sale later this year. Details were made public by Chris Lewis, the Regional Vice President of Xbox across Europe, the Middle East and Africa, in an interview with the console's official website, Xbox.com.

According to Lewis, the Xbox 360 will ship in two separate bundles &amp;mdash; the full system, and the Core System. The full system is the premium edition; it comes with the components and accessories &amp;mdash; including a detachable 20-gigabyte hard drive and wireless controller &amp;mdash; that Microsoft believes necessary for experiencing 'the ultimate digital entertainment thrill ride'. It will retail at $399.99 in the US, €399.99 in Europe and £279.99 in the UK. The Core System is essentially a stripped-down version, offering the full power of the Xbox 360 without the add-on features. This edition will retail at $299.99 in the US, €299.99 in Europe and £209.99 in the UK.

Rumours have been circulating about the price tag since the Xbox 360 was unveiled to a blaze of publicity at this year's &lt;a href="w%3AE3"&gt;E3&lt;/a&gt;. Yesterday's announcement confirmed early speculation by analysts at major investment bank UBS that Microsoft would sell its new console at a loss. The stand-alone Xbox 360 contains $375 worth of hardware. With the console set to retail at $299.99 (or $399.99 with $100 worth of add-ons) Microsoft stands to make a $76 loss on each unit sold. It is expected that 933,000 to 1.2 million units will be sold in 2005, which means that the Xbox 360 could cost its publisher up to $91.2 million for this year alone. Microsoft plans to make up the lost income with sales of its eagerly awaited launch titles.

A year before the 9/11 attacks, through &lt;a href="w%3Adata%20mining"&gt;data mining&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Army"&gt;U.S. Army&lt;/a&gt; intelligence group had identified two terrorist cells, including &lt;a href="w%3AMohamed%20Atta%20al%20Sayed"&gt;Mohammed Atta&lt;/a&gt; and three other 9/11 hijackers. Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Shaffer, a liaison officer of a unit called ♡❤♡&lt;a href="w%3AAble%20Danger"&gt;Able Danger&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡, has spoken on the topic. By analysis of non-military data, several of the terrorists with direct links to top &lt;a href="w%3AAl-Qaeda"&gt;Al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; leadership were identified.

Able Danger also used publicly available information from government immigration agencies.

Description on CNN of the technology involved:

On the &lt;a href="w%3ASean%20Hannity"&gt;Sean Hannity Show&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday, Shaffer said there were direct links to top Al-Qaeda leaders. He repeated that on Thursday.

Commander &lt;a href="w%3ASergei%20Krikalev"&gt;Sergei Krikalev&lt;/a&gt; and flight engineer &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Phillips%20%28astronaut%29"&gt;John Phillips&lt;/a&gt; began a planned six-hour spacewalk earlier today, their first in the four months both men have been on the station. This week Krikalev exceeded &lt;a href="w%3ASergei%20Avdeyev"&gt;Sergei Avdeyev&lt;/a&gt;'s record of 748 (non-consecutive) days in space.

Their tasks include retrieval and replacement of several experiments, photographing a materials science experiment, retrieving radiation sensors, installation of a television camera for the first arrival of Europe's new cargo vessel and relocation of a grapple fixture for a crane. This will make room for the next shuttle crew to deliver radiation shields.

However, that delivery is going to have to wait.

&lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; delayed the next Shuttle flight until next year so their engineers have time to address the foam problem that occurred during the most recent flight. A rushed timetable for the previous launch has been criticised as a major contributing factor to the "same behavioral problems that contributed to the Columbia tragedy," an AP story stated.

The &lt;a href="w%3AGovernment%20of%20Australia"&gt;Australian Federal Government&lt;/a&gt; has revealed today that it is going to give A$21 million (US $15.76 million) as compensation to approximately 600 former RAAF maintenance workers, who where exposed to highly toxic chemicals while working on the fuel tanks of the nation's &lt;a href="w%3AF-111"&gt;F-111&lt;/a&gt; fleet.

Under the government's proposal, depending on the amount of exposure, a worker can expect to receive between A$10,000 and A$40,000 (US $7,500 - $30,000) to help cope with the side effects. The aircraft maintenance program started in the 1970s and was suspended in the late 1990s when the former workers started to show signs of medical problems ranging from memory loss to neurological problems.

The F-111 Deseal/Reseal Support Group responded to the government's package with anger. The Group's president Ian Fraser said "A$40,000 for a ruined life is simply not enough ... We've already got people who have died, who are dying, people who have lost their homes." 

He went on to describe that his group, which supports the workers and contractors who where based at &lt;a href="w%3ARAAF%20Amberley"&gt;Amberley Air Base&lt;/a&gt;, was "at war" with Veterans' Affairs Minister De-Anne Kelly.

<h1>Former British Northern Ireland secretary Mo Mowlam dies</h1>

&lt;a href="w%3AMo%20Mowlam"&gt;Mo Mowlam&lt;/a&gt;, the former &lt;a href="w%3ASecretary%20of%20State%20for%20Northern%20Ireland"&gt;Secretary for Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, has died at 8.10am BST (07:10 UTC) in a hospice after a fall two weeks ago. She was 55. 

In a statement, prime minister &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; called her "one of the shrewdest political minds I ever encountered. She was a natural politician, could read a situation and analyse and assess it as fast as anyone."

Another former cabinet minister, &lt;a href="w%3AClare%20Short"&gt;Clare Short&lt;/a&gt;, said: "She was a very beautiful young woman, she survived ill health and helped bring peace to Northern Ireland and now she's gone far too young."

Mo Mowlam was central to the negotiations leading to the &lt;a href="w%3AGood%20Friday%20Agreement"&gt;Good Friday Agreement&lt;/a&gt; and was popular in Britain for her straightforward approach, informality and honesty.

Ms Mowlam even received a standing ovation during prime minister Blair's speech during the 1998 Labour Party Conference. 

Mo Mowlam retired from political life in 2001, but continued to make the headlines by realising her autobiography which was critical of Blair's presidential style of government.

It is thought that the fall that made her go to hospital, and then the hospice where she died, was due to a lack of balance caused by a brain tumour.

<h1>China and Russia continue joint army exercise</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=China%20and%20Russia%20continue%20joint%20army%20exercise&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; armed forces began their first ever joint military exercises since the &lt;a href="w%3AKorean%20War"&gt;Korean War&lt;/a&gt;, when Russia was still part of the &lt;a href="w%3ASoviet%20Union"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;, on Thursday. The exercises are expected to last for eight days. 

10,000 troops &amp;mdash; about 1800 Russians, the rest Chinese &amp;mdash; are participating in the war games. The exercises simulate &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;-mandated police action to restore order in a fictitious country torn by ethnic unrest. They began in the eastern Russian port-city of &lt;a href="w%3AVladivostok"&gt;Vladivostok&lt;/a&gt; and are supposed to culminate in a mock invasion involving beach landings and paratrooper drops off the coast of the &lt;a href="w%3AJiaodong"&gt;Jiaodong&lt;/a&gt; peninsula in eastern China.

Russian and Chinese officials have framed the exercises as promoting international cooperation, but some in the US and elsewhere see the exercises as preparation for a possible future invasion of &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;, and as a challenge to US dominance in Asia &amp;mdash; particularly in &lt;a href="w%3AAfghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;. The exercises come amid increasing speculation in the US that China may come to replace the US as the world's greatest superpower.

Russia and China are working together to help form of a world order that will be based on multipolarity, respect for international law, and a leading role for the UN, Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Alexeyev said on Monday, August 15, 2005.&lt;a href="http%3A//english.people.com.cn/200508/16/eng20050816_202747.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 

“The exercise will be carried out in the framework of the fight against international terrorism and extremism, to respond to new threats and challenges,” said Liang Guanglie, chief of staff of China’s armed forces.&lt;a href="http%3A//www.defensenews.com/story.php%3FF%3D1043611%26amp%3BC%3Dasiapac"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

But others citing the use in the operation of advanced aircraft atypical of a peacekeeping operation, say the countries have ulterior motives. "The main target is the US. Both sides want to improve their position for bargaining in terms of security, politics and economics," said Jin Canrong, professor of international relations at the &lt;a href="w%3ARenmin%20University%20of%20China"&gt;People's University of China&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href="http%3A//www.guardian.co.uk/china/story/0%2C7369%2C1551832%2C00.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

A Taiwanese official quoted by Mosnews.com said, China's involvement in the operations represents “the biggest security threat in the Asiatic-Pacific region.” &lt;a href="http%3A//www.mosnews.com/commentary/2005/08/18/china.shtml"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

However other analysts speculate that Russia's motivations for using the aircraft, including &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ATupolev%20Tu-95"&gt;Tu-95 strategic bombers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ATupolev%20Tu-22M"&gt;Tu-22M long-range bombers&lt;/a&gt;, in the exercises may be to promote their sale to the Chinese.

"Military cooperation is linked with political and economic cooperation as part of a bigger package," said Robert Karniol, Asia-Pacific editor for Jane's Defence Weekly. "It's not an adversarial posture."&lt;a href="http%3A//www.guardian.co.uk/china/story/0%2C7369%2C1551832%2C00.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Many have noted that the joint exercises are an emblem of increasingly warm relations between China and Russia since the dissolution of the Soviet Union. But writing In an editorial for the ♡❤International Herald Tribune♡❤, Phillip Bowring disagrees, saying that the primary purpose of the operations is as a warning to the US. "The current Russia-China joint military exercises are not so much a symbol of trust and friendship between the two as a symptom of American overstretch. The two are reminding the United States of the limits of its unilateral global power."&lt;a href="http%3A//www.iht.com/articles/2005/08/19/news/edbowring.php"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Despite speculation into the motives of Russia and China, the US has given at least token support to the idea that the exercises could promote international interests. “We are following the exercises,” U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said this week. “We expect that they will be conducted in a manner that supports some mutual goal of regional stability shared by the United States, China and Russia.”&lt;a href="http%3A//www.defensenews.com/story.php%3FF%3D1043611%26amp%3BC%3Dasiapac"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Others say the operations are mainly a response to separatism and Islamic extremism in Russian &lt;a href="w%3AChechnya"&gt;Chechnya&lt;/a&gt; and the Chinese &lt;a href="w%3AXinjiang"&gt;Xinjiang&lt;/a&gt;.

“The exercises are the logical continuation of the first signs of cooperation between Russia and China in the struggle against ‘orange revolutions,’ separatism and the dominant influence of the U.S. in the Euroasiatic sphere,” the Gazeta.ru news website wrote Thursday. Orange was the color adopted by supporters of last year’s revolution in Ukraine, which along with mass demonstrations in Georgia and Kyrgyzstan, brough pro-Western administrations to power. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.fortwayne.com/mld/journalgazette/news/nation/12424310.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The war games have been called "&lt;a href="w%3APeace%20Mission%202005"&gt;Peace Mission 2005&lt;/a&gt;".

Two &lt;a href="w%3AKatyusha"&gt;Katyusha&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Arocket"&gt;rockets&lt;/a&gt; exploded this morning (8:44 AM UTC+3) in &lt;a href="w%3AAqaba"&gt;Aqaba&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJordan"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt;, near the &lt;a href="w%3AUSS%20Ashland%20%28LSD-48%29"&gt;USS Ashland&lt;/a&gt;, which has been docking at the Aqaba port for the last ten days. One Jordanian soldier was killed. Another rocket exploded in &lt;a href="w%3AEilat"&gt;Eilat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;. 

One rocket narrowly missed the USS Ashland and struck a warehouse in the vicinity of the Ashland and the &lt;a href="w%3AUSS%20Kearsarge%20%28LHD-3%29"&gt;USS Kearsarge&lt;/a&gt;, killing a Jordanian soldier, Private Ahmad Alnajdawi, and injuring another. The two amphibious ships had been docking at the Aqaba port for the last ten days. The other missile fell near a Jordanian hospital but caused no injuries. 

Commander Jeff Breslau of the U.S. Fifth Fleet told reporters "♡❤I can confirm that a rocket flew over the bow of USS Ashland and the rocket impacted in the roof of a warehouse. No sailors or marines were injured. It’s pretty safe to conclude that they were probably trying to hit one or both of the ships♡❤".

The rocket that was aimed at Eilat exploded about 15 meters from the Eilat airport, near several hotels. An Israeli taxi driver, Meir Farhan (40), was lightly injured. Farhan told the press "♡❤I heard a noise, the car shook, and I kept driving for two more meters. I didn't realize what it was; when I went out of the car I saw a hole in the ground on the asphalt."

A branch of the Al-Qaeda linked terrorist organization &lt;a href="w%3AAbdullah%20Yusuf%20Azzam"&gt;Abdullah Azzam&lt;/a&gt; Brigades in &lt;a href="w%3AEgypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt; has claimed responsibility for the attack. They also claim responsibility for &lt;a href="Many%20dead%20in%20Egyptian%20resort%20blasts"&gt;last month's terror attack&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASharm%20el-Sheikh"&gt;Sharm el-Sheikh&lt;/a&gt;, Egypt and for the &lt;a href="w%3A2004%20Sinai%20bombings"&gt;2004 attack on Egyptian tourist resorts&lt;/a&gt;.

Immediately after the attack, the two &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; Navy Ships left the Aqaba port. All flights in the Eilat airport were briefly delayed before the explosion site was cleared of debris.

Jordanian security forces have located the launch site on a nearby rooftop. They are searching for three people with connection to the attack, two &lt;a href="w%3ASyria"&gt;Syrian&lt;/a&gt; nationals and one &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraqi&lt;/a&gt;.

Israeli Defense Minister, &lt;a href="w%3AShaul%20Mofaz"&gt;Shaul Mofaz&lt;/a&gt; said that Israeli and Jordanian security forces are cooperating. "♡❤We are certain the Jordanians are also acting to thwart such attacks♡❤" Mofaz said. "♡❤There were no prior warnings regarding this specific case, but we're alert.♡❤".

Eilat and Aqaba are both considered international tourist destinations in their respective countries.

&lt;a href="w%3APierre%20Nkurunziza"&gt;Pierre Nkurunziza&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the former rebel group &lt;a href="w%3ACNDD-FDD"&gt;CNDD-FDD&lt;/a&gt;, has been elected unopposed as President of &lt;a href="w%3ABurundi"&gt;Burundi&lt;/a&gt; by the country's Senate and National Assembly. The CNDD-FDD had won landslide victories in communal and national elections earlier this year, the first since the 1993 assassination of President &lt;a href="w%3AMelchior%20Ndadaye"&gt;Melchior Ndadaye&lt;/a&gt; plunged Burundi into more than a decade of ethnically-charged civil war. Nkurunziza replaces &lt;a href="w%3ADomitien%20Ndayizeye"&gt;Domitien Ndayizeye&lt;/a&gt;, who had served as head of a transitional government since 2003. 

One key challenge will be to resolve ongoing tension between the country's &lt;a href="w%3AHutu"&gt;Hutu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATutsi"&gt;Tutsi&lt;/a&gt; ethnic groups. More than 300,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed since 1993. Burundi's Tutsi-dominated army is believed to have killed thousands of Hutu civilians during the ten-year civil war, while Nkurunziza's own group, CNDD-FDD, has been accused of deliberately killing Tutsis. The extremist group Palipehutu-FNL continues to stage attacks, with this week seeing the first anniversary of the Gatumba massacre, in which more than 150 &lt;a href="w%3ACongo"&gt;Congolese&lt;/a&gt; Tutsi refugees were killed.

According to Online, 13 people were killed and over a hundred injured in armed clashes between rival political factions in &lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday August 18, 2005 local time. The attacks centered around polling stations throughout the country where elections for local offices were taking place.

The first of the clashes occurred in the &lt;a href="w%3ABannu%20%28district%29"&gt;Bannu district&lt;/a&gt; in Pakistan's &lt;a href="w%3ANorth-West%20Frontier%20Province%2C%20Pakistan"&gt;North-West Frontier Province&lt;/a&gt;. There three people directly participating in the armed clashes were shot dead. Their political ties are unclear. Many others were injured in the incident.

Two were killed in a clash in &lt;a href="w%3AKhiali"&gt;Khiali&lt;/a&gt; in the Punjabi district of &lt;a href="w%3AGujranwala"&gt;Gujranwala&lt;/a&gt; and more than fifteen were injured. One was killed in the &lt;a href="w%3AMultan"&gt;Multan district&lt;/a&gt; where another 15 were injured.

Three people were injured due to sporadic shooting in the &lt;a href="w%3ASialkot"&gt;Sialkot district&lt;/a&gt; in Punjab.

Seventeen were injured in the district of &lt;a href="w%3ALodhran"&gt;Lodhran&lt;/a&gt; in Punjab, including a candidate for the position of &lt;a href="w%3Anazim"&gt;nazim&lt;/a&gt;. There, four people were arrested.

In the southern &lt;a href="w%3ABalochistan"&gt;Balochistan&lt;/a&gt; district of Jafarabad, a scuffle occurred and at least nineteen people were injured, according to a BBC reporter. 

In &lt;a href="w%3ADera%20Allah%20Yar"&gt;Dera Allah Yar&lt;/a&gt; in Pakistan's &lt;a href="w%3AJaffrabad"&gt;Jaffrabad district&lt;/a&gt;, members of the &lt;a href="w%3AJamali"&gt;Jamali&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AImrani"&gt;Imrani&lt;/a&gt; ethnic groups exchanged fire two hours after polling began. Both groups used automatic weapons, and one person was killed at the scene of the clash. Two others died later while receiving medial care. Nineteen others were injured, three of whom are reported to be in critical condition.

Army personnel were called to maintain peace in ten of the Punjab's 17 districts. In total, 40 of Pakistan's 53 districts received army assistance in an attempt to keep the peace. Security was heightened in many areas of the country.

Pakistan has many sources of conflict, ranging from supporters of Al-Queda and the former Afghanistan Taliban government, to those involved in terrorist activities against India over disputed borders, to tensions between the numerous political, ethnic, tribal, and religious factions.

&lt;a href="w%3AMounir%20el-Motassadeq"&gt;Mounir el-Motassadeq&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="Morocco"&gt;Moroccan&lt;/a&gt; who was a friend of several &lt;a href="w%3A9/11"&gt;9/11&lt;/a&gt; hijackers, has been sentenced to seven years in prison for membership in a terrorist organisation by a court in &lt;a href="w%3AHamburg"&gt;Hamburg&lt;/a&gt;. The court, however, said that there is no proof that Motassadeq knew about the 9/11 plans or participated in them. 

Presiding judge Ernst-Rainer Schudt said that Motassadeq has played an important role in running the financial affairs of other cell members and covered their absence while they were in terror training camps. But he said that Motassadey wasn't "the same caliber as [Mohammed] &lt;a href="w%3AMohammed%20Atta"&gt;Atta&lt;/a&gt;", the leader of the 9/11 hijackers. Schudt also complained that the lack of cooperation by U.S. authorities in providing witnesses and delievering evidence left the court in "an unsatisfactory situation". U.S. authorities denied the court access to key witnesses in their custody such as &lt;a href="w%3ARamzi%20Binalshibh"&gt;Ramzi Binalshibh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AKhalid%20Shaikh%20Mohammed"&gt;Khalid Shaikh Mohammed&lt;/a&gt; and out of security concerns only provided written testimonies, which have very limited legal standing under German law.

Relatives of 9/11 victims who attended the trial are reportedly satisfied with the outcome. "This is a clear sign the rule of law can be an answer to terrorism" said Andreas Schulz, a lawyer representing relatives. Federal prosecutors are however unhappy with the ruling, since they also sought a conviction for accessory to murder. They, as well as Motassedeq who wanted acquittal, are going to appeal before Germany's Supreme Court.

Back in 2003, Motassadeq was sentenced to 15 years in jail for accessory to murder but that ruling was overturned by the Supreme Court, making this retrial necessary.

&lt;a href="Former%20British%20Northern%20Ireland%20secretary%20Mo%20Mowlam%20dies"&gt;Former British Northern Ireland secretary Mo Mowlam dies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Mo Mowlam, the former Secretary for Northern Ireland, died this morning at 07:10 UTC in a hospice after a fall two weeks ago. She was 55.

Mo Mowlam was central to the negotiations leading to the Good Friday Agreement and was popular in Britain for her straightforward approach, informality and honesty.

Two Katyusha rockets exploded this morning at 0844 UTC+3 in Aqaba, Jordan, near the USS Ashland, which has been docking at the Aqaba port for the last ten days. One Jordanian soldier was killed. Another rocket exploded in Eilat, Israel.

Commander Sergei Krikalev and flight engineer John Phillips began a planned six-hour spacewalk earlier today, their first in the four months both men have been on the station.

Meanwhile, NASA are delaying the next Shuttle flight until next year so their engineers have time to address the foam problem that occurred during the most recent flight.

An explosion from an underground utility chamber in downtown &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; severely injured a woman and shattered a window at a &lt;a href="w%3ARalph%20Lauren"&gt;Ralph Lauren&lt;/a&gt; clothing store shortly after 10:00 a.m. Pacific time Friday. According to a caller to KCBS radio, a woman was engulfed in flames after the explosion triggered a fire in the store. The fire was quickly put out.

A bomb squad is currently investigating the explosion, and the cause has yet to be determined. One official said the explosion may have been caused by an electrical transformer. A witness described a fireball coming out of the side of the building

&lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Gas%20and%20Electric%20Company"&gt;Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co.&lt;/a&gt; company spokesman Paul Moreno has stated that "there was no indication of a gas leak." Moreno also described the aftermath of the blast. "The explosion did displace manhole covers — two round steel ones — and it also displaced a concrete cover as well," Moreno said.

Some accounts have described a rift in the sidewalk caused by the explosion below.

Construction worker Tom Demartini, who was sitting in his truck outside the Ralph Lauren store, stated he saw the sidewalk rise up six or seven inches. "It sounded like a big poof, then there was a lot of smoke," Demartini said. "One woman looked like she was badly burned." 

The burned woman was taken to the emergency room at St. Francis Hospital. Hospital spokeswoman Linda Gillespie had no immediate comment on her condition. Her name was not released. 

Workers in a nearby office building described how the blast shook their buildings and that they thought it was an earthquake. According to one woman, the elevator in her building stopped. 

Scores of police have evacuated buildings several blocks around the explosion. Kearny street between Sutter and Market has been closed to both vehicles and pedestrians.

Drug maker &lt;a href="w%3AMerck%20%26amp%3B%20Co."&gt;Merck &amp; Co.&lt;/a&gt; was found liable for a person's death concerning the use of the pain medication &lt;a href="w%3AVioxx"&gt;Vioxx&lt;/a&gt;, according to a jury verdict in a Texas court. 

The plaintiff's case, headed by the widow of Robert Ernst, who died in 2001 of an &lt;a href="w%3Airregular%20heartbeat"&gt;irregular heartbeat&lt;/a&gt; and of clogged arteries while on the drug Vioxx, was successfully awarded $253.4 million dollars. Vioxx was pulled from the shelves in 2004 after a study discovered it could double the risk of a &lt;a href="w%3Aheart%20attack"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3Astroke"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt; if taken for longer than 1.5 years. However, the US government agency, the FDA, decided in February of this year to allow the product back on the shelves.

Merck's stock price dropped 10% within minutes of the verdict being announced, and continued to fall hours after. There are in excess of 4,200 other Vioxx-related lawsuits pending across the USA. 

The company plans to appeal the decision.

Administrators Ferrier Hodgson are working to get troubled EG Green and Sons, trading as Harvey Beef, back open in two weeks. Approximately 600 workers are directly employed by the company, which is both a major employer in the region and the region's largest meat exporter. South West Chamber of Commerce and Industries president Rolf Stene was quoted as saying "It could affect a lot of people, those 600 workers at the abattoir, farmers, shopkeepers, the service industry it would hit a lot of people right throughout the community." The employees have currently been forced to take annual leave.

Many beef producers are owed money by the company. The Pastoralists and Graziers Association (PGA) is still trying to identify creditors and EG Green and Sons are working with the administrators in order to "maximise returns to creditors". Despite the well known brand, the company has been trading at a loss in recent years. Recent expansions may be at the root of the sudden financial problems that forced the company to suspend operations.

Calls by the Opposition for a government enquiry were rebuffed by the Agriculture Minister's parliamentary secretary, Tony McRae, saying "an inquiry would be counter productive." The State Government has at this stage declined to assist EG Green and Sons.

<h1>Indonesian blackout caused by lack of generation capacity</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Indonesian%20blackout%20caused%20by%20lack%20of%20generation%20capacity&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A power outage in &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; that left about 100 million people without electricity has caused a political crisis. The country's state-owned energy monopoly, &lt;a href="w%3APerusahaan%20Listrik%20Negara"&gt;PLN&lt;/a&gt;, has not determined the immediate cause, and the country's &lt;a href="w%3ASusilo%20Bambang%20Yudhoyono"&gt;president&lt;/a&gt; has ordered the national intelligence agency and police to investigate.

The blackout appears related to deficiencies in Indonesia's power generation capacity.

The power failure follows attempts to deal with the country's growing energy crisis, including conservation and trying to allow private companies to provide energy, which was ruled unconstitutional in 2004. In January, the Indonesian government held a special energy summit to attract investment in their energy infrastructure. At the summit they set the goal of adding 22,000 &lt;a href="w%3Amegawatt"&gt;megawatts&lt;/a&gt; to Indonesia's present capacity of 23,000 megawatts, in order to support the country's growth.

The &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Bank"&gt;World Bank&lt;/a&gt; and others have warned that without more investment in the country's energy infrastructure an energy deficit will result. However, foreign investors remain wary of investing in Indonesia. "The power outage has resulted in worries over an energy crisis which could hurt the nation's industrial sector," said a trader on &lt;a href="w%3AIHSG"&gt;Indonesia's stock market&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href="http%3A//sg.biz.yahoo.com/050818/15/3uc28.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The outage began at 10:23 a.m. local time, August 18, 2005, when power failed along the electrical system that connects &lt;a href="w%3AJava"&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABali"&gt;Bali&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AMadura"&gt;Madura&lt;/a&gt;, causing outages in Java and Bali. Almost half of the country depends on the electrical grid that experienced failures. Some of the main lines on the grid are over 20 years old, according to PLN president Eddie Widiono.

The blackout caused traffic jams in &lt;a href="w%3AJakarta"&gt;Jakarta&lt;/a&gt;, forced cancellation of several international and domestic flights at Jakarta's &lt;a href="w%3ASoekarno-Hatta%20International%20Airport"&gt;Soekarno-Hatta International Airport&lt;/a&gt;, shut down Jakarta's electric train service, and disrupted hospital operations. Some larger hospitals were forced to delay surgeries while many smaller hospitals could not receive patients. About 1,800 officers were called into action by Jakarta's metropolitan police to deal with short-term problems caused by the power failure.

Candles used in place of electric lighting started six fires in Jakarta alone.

Mulyo Aji, a PLN official, said more power failures are likely in the future as energy demand increases, without any corresponding new supplies of electricity scheduled to come online soon.

The British newspaper &lt;a href="w%3ADaily%20Mail"&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/a&gt; claims that &lt;a href="w%3AScotland%20Yard"&gt;Scotland Yard&lt;/a&gt; has offered the family of &lt;a href="w%3AJean%20Charles%20de%20Menezes"&gt;Jean Charles de Menezes&lt;/a&gt;, who was mistaken for a suicide bomber and shot by British police on July 22nd, one million US$ (£560,000) in compensation. The paper quotes his parent as saying: "We will not be bought off. We will not be silenced. This is not about money, this is about justice."

According to Yasmin Khan, of the Justice4Jean campaign, John Yates, deputy assistant commissioner at Scotland Yard, flew to Brazil about two weeks ago and made the initial offer. Khan said: "Money was being bandied about but was not accepted. The family felt it was insulting and was not prepared to be bought off." She also stated that she considers Scotland Yard's alleged actions to be part of a cover-up. 

Menezes' cousin Alessandro Pereira told the Daily Mail: "The police knew Jean was innocent, yet they let my family suffer. They let us suffer. &lt;a href="w%3AIan%20Blair"&gt;Ian Blair&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AMetropolitan%20Police"&gt;Metropolitan Police&lt;/a&gt; commissioner) let us suffer. For three weeks, we have had to listen to lie after lie about Jean and how he was killed. The police met my family yet they still didn't tell us the truth. Did they think because we are poor Brazilians we do not deserve the truth?" 

Scotland Yard has denied the reports. A Spokesman said: "The only discussions we have had so far with the family of Jean Charles de Menezes have been about initial expenses. We strongly refute any suggestion that a figure anywhere in the region of one million dollars has been offered as compensation."

According to documents recently declassified by the &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20State%20Department"&gt;State Department&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , top U.S. and &lt;a href="Afghan%20Taliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt; officials discussed the potential assassination of &lt;a href="Osama%20bin%20Laden"&gt;Osama bin Laden&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A1998%20U.S.%20embassy%20bombings"&gt;bombings of U.S. embassies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 1998.

The documents were released on Thursday by the National Security Archive under the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFreedom%20of%20Information%20Act"&gt;Freedom of Information Act&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . They show that the deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan, Alan Eastham Jr., met with Wakil Ahmed, a close aide to Taliban leader &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMullah%20Omar"&gt;Mullah Omar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , on November 28 1998 at the Taliban embassy in &lt;a href="Islamabad"&gt;Islamabad&lt;/a&gt;. 

In that meeting Wakil Ahmed told Eastham Jr. that the Taliban would understand the U.S. desire to have bin Laden expelled from &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;. He said that one possibility to "resolve" the "bin Laden Situation" would be if the U.S. were to "kill him, or arrange for bin Laden to be assassinated".

Wakil said the Taliban wanted to resolve the "bin Laden problem" as quickly as possible because a failure to do so would result in American bombing of Afghanistan and the Taliban's "termination".

After months of rumor and speculation, the Colombian brewery &lt;a href="w%3AGrupo%20Bavaria"&gt;Grupo Bavaria&lt;/a&gt;, which was founded in &lt;a href="w%3A1889"&gt;1889&lt;/a&gt; and is the second largest in &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20America"&gt;South America&lt;/a&gt;, has been acquired by &lt;a href="w%3ASABMiller"&gt;SABMiller&lt;/a&gt; in the biggest merger in &lt;a href="w%3AColombia"&gt;Colombian&lt;/a&gt; history. In a &lt;a href="w%3AMerger%23Acquisition"&gt;buyout&lt;/a&gt; in which the &lt;a href="w%3Amnc"&gt;multinational&lt;/a&gt; with headquarters in &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; will obtain 71.8% of Grupo Bavaria's stock, previously owned by the &lt;a href="w%3ASanto%20Domingo%20family"&gt;Santo Domingo family&lt;/a&gt; (owner of &lt;a href="w%3ACaracol%20Televisi%C3%B3n"&gt;Caracol Televisión&lt;/a&gt; and, until recently, of &lt;a href="w%3AAvianca"&gt;Avianca&lt;/a&gt;). The Santo Domingo family is in turn to receive 225 million shares of SABMiller, which is equivalent to 15.1% of the company. SABMiller is to pay nearly $7.8 billion to complete the transaction. 

The news was announced Tuesday at dawn (Colombian local time). 

Thus SABMiller, the second largest brewery in the world &amp;mdash; surpassed only by Belgian &lt;a href="w%3AInBev"&gt;InBev&lt;/a&gt;, enters &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20America"&gt;South America&lt;/a&gt; through Bavaria's operations in Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, and Panama, where it controls between 79% and 99% of the beer market. 

Of the $7.8 billion paid by SABMiller, $3.5 billion worth is stock for the Santo Domingo family, $1.5 billion is cash to buy out the minority stockholders, and the rest, $1.8 billion, will cover the present debts of the Colombian brewing giant. 

During recent months, &lt;a href="w%3ARicardo%20Obreg%C3%B3n"&gt;Ricardo Obregón&lt;/a&gt;, president of Grupo Empresarial Bavaria, denied the persistent rumors of a possible sale. In addition to SABMiller, &lt;a href="w%3AHeineken"&gt;Heineken&lt;/a&gt; and InBev had been interested in the Colombian company. Obregón will have to inform the head of the Colombian stock market of the acquisition. 

Monday, when the international media reported the transaction, Grupo Bavaria's stock rose 5.36% in the Colombian stock market and reached a price of 49,100 &lt;a href="w%3AColombian%20peso"&gt;COP&lt;/a&gt; ($21.23).

The labour dispute between the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation"&gt;Canadian Broadcasting Corporation&lt;/a&gt; and its union the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Media%20Guild"&gt;Canadian Media Guild&lt;/a&gt; continues, with no sign that the sides will return to contract negotiations. The CBC has locked out about 5500 of its union employees, which include broadcasters and technicians. The main disagreement is over the proportion of permanent workers CBC hires.

CBC management wants to increase the number of employees hired under a fixed-term contract basis, as opposed to permanent staff, saying it will give them more flexibility. The Canadian Media Guild calls CBC management's contract offer "little more than a veiled attempt to buy off employees with their own money".

&lt;a href="w%3AInter%20Milan"&gt;Inter Milan&lt;/a&gt; won the &lt;a href="w%3AItalian%20Super%20Cup"&gt;Italian Super Cup&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday for the first time in sixteen years. The match took place at &lt;a href="w%3AStadio%20Delle%20Alpi"&gt;Stadio delle Alpi&lt;/a&gt; in Torino, Italy against the Serie A champions &lt;a href="w%3AJuventus"&gt;Juventus&lt;/a&gt;. The cup is the first opportunity to win a trophy in the Italian football season. 

Argentinian midfielder &lt;a href="w%3AJuan%20Sebastian%20Veron"&gt;Juan Sebastian Veron&lt;/a&gt; scored the only goal of the match. He received the assist from &lt;a href="w%3AAdriano"&gt;Adriano&lt;/a&gt; in the sixth minute of the first half of extra time. 

Roberto Mancini, coach of Inter Milan, described the match as "tough". Inter now prepare for a preliminary round match of the Champions' League against Shakhtar Donetsk on Wednesday. Serie A, the top division of Italian football, begins on August 27 with Inter being one of the teams favored to win.

The ban on using the term "mate" as a form of address for fellow Australian security officers has been overturned. The ban was previously reported here on Wikinews &lt;a href="No%20%27mates%27%20in%20Australia%27s%20Parliament%20House"&gt;3 days ago&lt;/a&gt;.
A daily email brief sent to security staff revoked the "mate" ban and suggested that security officers use their judgement about how to address visitors, employees and Parliamentarians.
The edit said: ♡❤"PSS officers are reminded to treat everyone in Parliament House with respect and courtesy, and to be sensitive to the expectations of visitors and building occupants. In particular, PSS officers need to be aware of when a degree of informality may be acceptable and when a more formal approach is required, and should not use colloquialisms where these might not be understood or appreciated."♡❤

The decision to ban the word "mate" provoked significant expressions of outrage from Australia's Prime Minister and many other Members of the Parliament.

The Catholic &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Youth%20Day%202005"&gt;World Youth Day 2005&lt;/a&gt; concluded today with a open-air mass by Pope &lt;a href="w%3ABenedict%20XVI"&gt;Benedict XVI&lt;/a&gt; at the Marienfeld, about 15 km west of &lt;a href="w%3ACologne"&gt;Cologne&lt;/a&gt;.

Speaking to some one million pilgrims from about 200 countries the Pope called for a "return to God" . In his sermon, he condemned the commercialisation of faith and said that "Religion constructed on a 'do-it-yourself' basis cannot ultimately help us".

He announced that the next World Youth Day will be held in &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; and concluded with short addresses in nine languages in which he called upon the faithful to "walk together in unity".

A journalist working for the German weekly magazine &lt;a href="w%3ADer%20Spiegel"&gt;Der Spiegel&lt;/a&gt; described the speech this way: "First faith, then morality".

The Pope has been in his native Germany since Thursday. During his visit he met with high ranking politicians, made the first ever visit of a Pope to a German synagogue and spoke to representatives of the Muslim community.

&lt;a href="w%3Ahttp%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English%20cricket%20team"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; squared the &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Ashes"&gt;Ashes&lt;/a&gt; series against &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20cricket%20team"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; by holding on for a 2 run victory at &lt;a href="w%3AEdgbaston"&gt;Edgbaston&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ABirmingham"&gt;Birmingham&lt;/a&gt;.

Australia came close to victory themselves, however Steven Harminson took the wicket of Michael Kasprovic to clinch victory on the fourth day of the game. 

The match looked to be in Englands hands following sterling batting from Kevin Pietersen (71, 20) and Andrew Flintoff (68, 73) which left the Australians needing to score 282 to win the match. The tourists were soon in trouble ending the third day at 175-8 with over 100 runs still to score and only 2 wickets in hand.

However on the fourth morning the Australian tailenders scored steadily and despite the loss of Shane Warne for 42 the final wicket pair closed in on the target.

The Edgbaston crowd were reduced to biting their nails as the match came down to the wire; Australia needing just 3 runs to win and England needing just one wicket.

Harmison produced a lifting delivery from just short of a length which Kasprovic could only fend off with a glove through to the England 'keeper Geraint Jones, leaving Australia agonisingly short of a memorable win and the series all square at one match each with three to play.

Scores: England 407 and 182, Australia 308 and 279

The Third Ashes test ended in a draw as England ended 1 wicket short of victory. A captain's innings of 156 by Ricky Ponting helped Australia save the game on the fifth day. 

When Ponting was dismissed with four overs to go a tense endgame ensued as England sought the final wicket but Brett Lee and Glenn McGrath fought to deny them that prize.

Earlier in the game the batsmen held sway as the third test saw the first centuries of the series from England's Michael Vaughan (166) and Andrew Strauss (106). 

With England setting Australia an unlikely 423 to win in just over a day it was Ponting's 156 that was the most significant contribution as he batted for six hours to deny England a second consecutive victory.

The series remains at 1-1 with two matches to play.

Scores: England 444 and 280-6 dec. Australia 302 and 371-9

The &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle"&gt;Space Shuttle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADiscovery"&gt;Discovery&lt;/a&gt; has returned to the &lt;a href="w%3AKennedy%20Space%20Center"&gt;Kennedy Space Center&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AFlorida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;.
The 109 ton vehicle was flown back from &lt;a href="w%3AEdwards%20Airforce%20Base"&gt;Edwards Airforce Base&lt;/a&gt; (AFB) in &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; on top of a modified &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20747"&gt;Boeing 747&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href="w%3AShuttle%20Carrier%20Aircraft"&gt;Shuttle Carrier Aircraft&lt;/a&gt;. The 3,591 km journey across the United States took 2 days and cost about one million dollars. The Shuttle Carrier Aircraft made pit-stops in &lt;a href="w%3AOklahoma"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALouisiana"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; before landing in Florida this morning.

On its way back from space, Discovery had to land at Edwards AFB on &lt;a href="w%3AAugust%209"&gt;August 9&lt;/a&gt; because its homebase in Florida reported bad weather.

About 90 law enforcement officers from multiple agencies broke up what they said was a &lt;a href="w%3Arave%20party"&gt;rave party&lt;/a&gt; on public and private property in the &lt;a href="http%3A//maps.google.com/maps%3Fll%3D40.114577%2C-111.629848%26amp%3Bspn%3D0.010634%2C0.014699%26amp%3Bz%3D1%26amp%3Bt%3Dk%26amp%3Bhl%3Den"&gt;Diamond Fork&lt;/a&gt; area of &lt;a href="w%3ASpanish%20Fork%2C%20Utah"&gt;Spanish Fork&lt;/a&gt; canyon, an hour outside of &lt;a href="w%3ASalt%20Lake%20City"&gt;Salt Lake City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUtah"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt;, at about 11:30 p.m. Saturday (5:30 Sunday &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;).

According to the county, the Sheriff's Office had been investigating similar parties since the beginning of the season. In a press release from the Sheriff's Office in Utah County, the department states that previous allegations of sexual abuse at other raves, as well as various firearm and theft violations, were reasons for the investigation. The release continues on to state that the proper permit was not obtained before the event started.
The promoters deny this allegation and insist that all permits were legally obtained before the event.
Armed with semi-automatic assault rifles, tasers, and tear gas, the police used dogs to sweep the crowd for narcotics. At least one helicopter was used in the operation, which served as a large spotlight for the ground teams. Prior to raiding the show, several unnamed police informants had reportedly told police that they had observed some "illegal activities". 

The promoter says the party took place on private property, named Child's Ranch, with express permission from the owner. The property owner has apparently had at least one previous lawsuit with police over a similar event. &lt;a href="w%3AUtah%20County%2C%20Utah"&gt;Utah County&lt;/a&gt; requires a permit, bond and county commission approval for all gatherings with more than 250 people present and which can be expected to continue for 12 hours or more. DJ time slots and Pro Audio and Lighting contracts show that the party was scheduled to go on for no more than ten hours. According to a DJ at the event, "They presold 700 tickets and they expected up to 3,000 people total." He added that by the time police arrived "the crowd was about 1,500". 

The police have publicly stated that only a permit from the health department was obtained, and that a Utah mass gathering permit was needed. The promoters have stated that they had the required permit, and have given a permit number (# 2005-11). Jay Stone, who handles mass gathering permits for the Utah County Health Department’s Bureau of Environmental Health Services, has confirmed that the permit was applied for and granted for the party. Officials also claim that the party had spilled over onto public land, and that more than 60 arrests were made in total - for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, underage drinking, drug possession and distribution, resisting arrest, assault on a police officer, disorderly conduct, and one instance of a weapons offense, a pistol which was found in the home of the private property owners. Among the confiscated items and drugs found were cocaine, ecstasy, marijuana, mushrooms, alcohol, and drug paraphernalia. Some of the drugs may include those confiscated from attendees by private security guards - who were also arrested. 

Amateur video from the scene shows a number of SWAT police (Sheriff's press release places the figure at 90) screaming orders at the DJs to "Shut it down ♡❤now♡❤!" and yelling at others to "get out now, or I'll kick your ass in jail." Armed police are also seen tackling two attendees, Alaisha Matagi and Paul Maka. It is unclear from the video footage whether these actions were provoked or not. However, those shown on the two-minute long footage that are being forced to the ground do not appear to be resisting arrest. Both Matagi and Maka are charged with failure to obey a police officer and resisting arrest - Maka is also charged with interfering with police. Sheriff Jim Tracy stated in an email that both of them were tackled and arrested after assaulting a deputy, however, neither of them are being charged with assaulting a police officer.

A first hand account from a DJ booked to play at the party stated that while police were arresting a man accused of possession, the suspect was beaten to the ground and continually "kicked in the ribs" by four armed "soldiers" dressed in camouflage. The item was not shown on the video footage. According to the account, nobody resisted the policemen, and the crowd was orderly, but tear gas was thrown at the partiers as they attempted to leave as instructed. The DJ also states that police were attempting to confiscate video equipment, but an amateur video has still surfaced on the internet (see sources below). The video appears to have been taken near the DJ stand before it was moved to show more of the action.

Several attendees felt they should have the right to attend an event where drugs may be present, so long as they don't personally use them. "While it may be true that some individuals choose to take drugs at said events like this, myself as well as many others choose to go for the music. Just like anything, you have bad apples, but you shouldn't cut down the tree," said one attendee. "Raves are not the only musical gatherings where drugs are used and distributed," said another.

Other event-goers felt that the use of force in the shutdown was excessive - numerous eyewitness accounts by concertgoers describe people being beaten, tasered, or attacked with dogs. An email from Sheriff Jim Tracy stated that dogs and tasers were present at the raid, however, he also states that the tasers were not used on anyone, and that no dogs were deployed against concertgoers.

One account from an attendee, identified as "Colby", states: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I saw at least two people being beaten on the ground while barking, snarling dogs are held just a few feet from them. Weapons were being pointed at unarmed, peaceful civilians. A friend of mine was forced at gunpoint to put his hands on his head and turn around, because he asked if he could get his things from the tent."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Utah County sheriff's Sergeant Darren Gilbert also alleged that a 17-year-old girl was found overdosed on ecstasy, and was treated and released to her parents. According to an &lt;a href="http%3A//www.slcdnb.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php%3Ft%3D34%26amp%3Bhighlight%3Dversus"&gt;advertisement&lt;/a&gt; for the event, an attorney was present at the party. The local sheriff is scheduled to appear on Utah TV.
