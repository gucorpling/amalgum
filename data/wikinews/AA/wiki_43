The Internet group &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAnonymous%20%28group%29"&gt;Project Chanology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; today held protests critical of the &lt;a href="Church%20of%20Scientology"&gt;Church of Scientology&lt;/a&gt;. The protests marked what would have been the 49th birthday of &lt;a href="Lisa%20McPherson"&gt;Lisa McPherson&lt;/a&gt;, who is claimed to be a victim of the Church of Scientology's practices. Lisa died in 1995 during a running of what Scientologists refer to as an &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIntrospection%20Rundown"&gt;Introspection Rundown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a procedure intended to help Church members deal with a psychotic or deeply traumatic event. 

Protests were planned throughout the day in 14 countries and over 50 different cities. The estimation of total protesters world wide for Feb. 10, 2008 is 9,250 people.

♡❤Wikinews♡❤ had correspondents at a number of protest locations to report on the events. This article was updated throughout the day with reports from around the globe.

<h2>Location Reports</h2>

<h3>&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAdelaide"&gt;Adelaide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;</h3>
About 150 anonymous protesters turned out in Adelaide to protest the Church of Scientology. Most wore masks, many also wearing suits or wigs. 
A on-the-spot-word was created centered around a Scientologist present at the start of the protests. 'Infiltrator', AdelRAID also had an Anon attacked by a Scientologist trying to remove an Anon's mask to take a photo of his face, who had his picture taken before and after the attack by many anons.

200+ members of Anonymous gathered in Atlanta. While riot police were called to the scene as well as the local media, only one incident occurred. A person from the Anonymous crowd tried to enter the church to talk to them but police temporarily detained him. He was later released without charges.

Protesters in Boston covered all four corners of the block surrounding the Church with 30-45 people on each side of the streets and corners. Most protesters ranged from 18 to 25 years old. Crowds soon swelled to numbers of about 250. The weather was of typical New England weather, where it quickly jumped from sunny weather at the start to slight drizzling rain then to a downpour and eventually a flurry that lasted about 15–20 minutes before dissipating. However, even that did not drive the protesters away.

<h3>&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABrisbane"&gt;Brisbane&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;</h3>

<h3>&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABrussels"&gt;Brussels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Belgium"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;</h3>
The Brussels protest organisers decided to take things one step further than the "mask" dress code - and introduce a formal dress code of "Black, and Red Tie".

Saturday saw the start of press coverage for the event with Dutch-language national paper &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADe%20Morgen"&gt;De Morgen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; devoting four columns in their ♡❤reporter♡❤ section to the protest and events that led up to it. Lisa McPherson, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Cruise"&gt;Tom Cruise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Sweeney"&gt;John Sweeney&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; were all covered along with images of the "Anonymous" advertising poster and the European Church of Scientology HQ in the Brussels city centre.

The protesters met up at Parc Royal metro station about 1&amp;nbsp;km away from the European H.Q. of the Church of Scientology and spent approximately an hour putting finishing touches to placards and cutting up leaflets, all under the watchful eye of a number of suspected Scientology "spies" equipped with cameras and cellphones. Following closely the advice from police the group of approximately 30 marched to 91 Wetstraat where the Church H.Q. is in a subdued manner with banners and placards turned down. As the group marched to their point where a static protest was permitted three film crews from Belgian TV ran round filming the group and walking backwards to interview those who were prepared to speak to the press. Protesters came from as far afield as &lt;a href="Luxembourg"&gt;Luxembourg&lt;/a&gt;.

The police presence for the protest was fairly light, upon arrival at the protest site, 91 Wetstraat (Rue De La Loi) one van and three officers were parked outside the Scientology HQ, approximately 15 minutes later two other police cars had turned up - delivering the Brussels Central chief of police and another four officers to monitor the protest. Instructions were given to protesters that they could not, under Belgian law, conceal their faces with masks, scarves or veils.

The signs in use by the protesters included a large "HONK!" which whenever a passing motorist hit the horn roused a large cheer from the crowd. Others read "Scientology kills", "Religion is free, Scientology is not", "XENU.NET", "All your Thetans are belong to us", "Hello Scientology, We are Anonymous", and "Alien souls inhabit you". Some were crudely done handwriting, others had been made at the pre-protest meeting with stencils and spray paint.

A chant was started early on, and repeated a few times throughout the day, "Brainwash! Brainwash! Brainwash!", this could likely be heard by people within the Church H.Q. as a number of upper floor windows were open.

Leaflets were handed out to passers by and motorists as they stopped at the nearest set of traffic lights. While highlighting that Christianity, Judaism, and Islam will freely give you details about their religion Scientology was starkly contrasted as "Ask a Scientologist about their texts, You will be answered. ♡❤After your check clears♡❤".

The protest went off with no problems, although concern was expressed by some participants that they were not better allowed to conceal their identities. This was made extra concerning with the belief that some of those taking photos from a distance were members of the Church cataloguing the protesters.

<h3>&lt;a href="Buffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;</h3>
As many as 50 people turned up to protest the Church in cold weather and wind driven snow. With temperatures ranging from 10 to just 15 degrees Fahrenheit and winds at nearly 45 miles an hour, protesters held signs and braved Mother Nature. Some lost their signs in the wind a few times, but managed to swipe them back up before they got lost in the weather.

Among the protesters attending was &lt;a href="http%3A//www.lermanet.com/chuck_beatty/"&gt;Chuck Beatty&lt;/a&gt;, a former Scientologist of 27 years from the Sea Org in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APittsburgh%2C%20Pennsylvania"&gt;Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Pennsylvania. Several passing cars showed their support by honking, including a big red semi-truck tow truck. 

The police were on scene to make sure protesters followed laws, but they were off duty officers hired by the Church because they "needed protection from Anonymous," said O. Casillas of the Buffalo police Department. Casillas also stated that protesters, "according to New York state law", had to be at least 100 feet from the Church, but because of a fence, protesters were allowed to picket across the street from the Church.

Casillas also took a flier with the rules and regulations for protesters stating, "I cannot take sides here, but the Church privately hired us."

At least three members of the Church were seen photographing, videotaping, and counting anyone who was gathered outside the Church. The protesters were not approached by any members of the Church.

♡❤Wikinews♡❤ attempted to get a statement from the church, but Casillas stated that "the Church knew what organization [I] was from" and that "Wikinews was not welcome there [at the Church]."

♡❤Wikinews♡❤ recently published several stories and interviews that do not favor the Church and the officer's quotes suggest the Church is aware of those articles.

The Chicago protest against the Church began slightly before 11:00 a.m. (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Time%20Zone"&gt;central time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) and concluded at roughly 4:30 p.m.. Upwards of 70 protesters gathered in support of the protest. 

Though temperatures remained in the sub-zero range throughout the day (0 degrees Fahrenheit, -22 wind chill), spirits remained high. 

Participants handed out literature and held signs at the intersection of Lincoln, Wellington and Southport until roughly 2:00 p.m.. During that time, a nearby &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACatholic%20Church"&gt;Catholic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; church dismissed, and numerous Church-goers welcomed the fliers. 

Protesters garnered a multitude of honks from supportive motorists. After 2:00 p.m., the large group splintered into multiple travelling squads which navigated the Lakeview and Lincoln Park neighbourhoods until 4:30 p.m.. 

Protesters had to follow legal restrictions and the Church conducted the Centre's counter-protest measures, such as blocking their windows and holding service from 11:00 a.m. straight through 6:00 p.m..

Approximately 200 people protested Scientology along Cleveland Street in Clearwater. They were photographed by 20-year-old Scientologist David Pendery, who seemed to believe that it was "unlawful to wear a mask and I wanted to document it." The Church also hired ten police officers to monitor the protest.

The protest was delayed by 30 minutes so the protesters would not interrupt a Presbyterian Church service. &lt;a href="http%3A//blogs.tampabay.com/breakingnews/2008/02/scientology-pro.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

More than 100 people picketed on a street corner in front of the Dallas Church of Scientology. Protestors held up signs with pictures of Lisa McPherson, who was a Dallas native. "We want people to know we are raising awareness, and that is one of our main tools to fight Scientology," said one masked protestor. A few signs read "Honk if you hate Scientology", and some cars could be heard honking their horns as they passed by. Police were on the scene to ensure that the demonstration was peaceful. The Dallas Church of Scientology released a statement regarding the group Anonymous, which read, "Using Scientology's prominence, Anonymous hopes to garner more attention ... Religious bigotry of any nature is deplorable and profoundly affects the entire community."

<h3>&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEdinburgh"&gt;Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Scotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;</h3>
Around 50 to 140 people turned up at the Church of Scientology centre in Edinburgh to protest. As protesters were not allowed directly opposite the centre a small police presence was visible in order to control the crowd.

Banners with "Scientology Kills" were placed at the front of the protesters and chants gradually began to start as the day progressed. Leaflets were handed out to members of the public passing by while people within the Church of Scientology were seen to be taking photographs from inside the church.

Access to the church was restricted during the protest, but several protesters made comment to a reporter from the Scotsman newspaper.

The Houston protest hosted an estimated 81 people. Between 8 and 12 Houston police officers and staff were on site though, but stood and watched the protesters. There were no reports of significant confrontation, though scientologists and protesters took photographs of each other. A CW 39 cameraman was on site taking footage and conducting interviews. Broadcast television reports of the protest were carried on KHOU CBS 11 and KHCW CW 39 later in the evening.

<h3>&lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;</h3>
The first London protest took place outside the Church of Scientology HQ in Queen Victoria Street. Upon arrival at 10:30, approximately 50 people were in attendance. This was complemented by a small team of police officers. Members of the Church of Scientology were handing out flyers outside the HQ, with the protesters on the other side of the road. Numerous members of the media, as well as tens of amateur photographers and videographers were in attendance.

By 11:00, the number of protesters had grown to between 300 and 500. A variety of signs were on display, bearing such slogans as "Ron is Gone but the Con goes On" (referring to L. Ron Hubbard, founder of Scientology) and "$cientology Kills" (referring to the claims that the Church of Scientology extorts money from its members). The police responded to this growth in numbers with riot vans, a large number of Community Support officers, and Police Horses, as well as a dog unit. 

The protest at Queen Victoria Street was peaceful. Members of Anonymous were respectful of Police orders. Inside the building, security officers could be seen. Members were seen videoing and photographing the protests from the upper windows of the HQ building, prompting responses from the crowd. Signs were held saying "Honk if you hate Scientology" - causing a cheer from the crowd every time a car used the horn.

The infamous bright yellow "/b/" van was seen driving past early in the protest. At around 1:00 the protesters moved on towards Tottenham Court Road's "Dianetics and Scientology Life Improvement Centre", where the police presence was even higher, and crowd barriers were set up. Half of Tottenham Court Road was closed for the demonstration, so a single-file line of traffic was all that flowed between the protesters (of which a significant majority of the original number turned up) and the Church of Scientology building.

Members of the Church of Scientology were handing out flyers, much like at Queen Victoria Street. However, the crowd this time shouted for passers-by to "tear it up" - some of whom did. Police reacted to those tearing up the material and throwing it down with the issue of a littering ticket. This road was much busier than the previous one, and a large crowd gathered to look. The crowd could be heard shouting "It's a trap!" when members of the public were offered free Stress Tests by the members of the Church of Scientology. There were a number of minor incidents involving protesters (who were quickly distanced by the majority crowd), but no major violations took place.

Estimates by Anonymous for the total numbers at the event range from 300 to 800 people, however the BBC and City of London Police report 200 people at the event.

<h3>&lt;a href="Los%20Angeles%2C%20California"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;</h3>
At least 250 people attended the anti-Scientology protest in Los Angeles, California. The protesters gathered in the morning at a central location and proceeded by subway to the site of the first protest, the ♡❤Church of Scientology - Los Angeles♡❤. For nearly two hours the protesters chanted "We are Anonymous" and other slogans, and responded with yells and upheaval to honking cars that were passing by. The protest spread over two city blocks, and at one point the entire group of protesters circled the city block containing various Scientology buildings.

The protest then proceeded via subway to the Church of Scientology International building in Hollywood. There the protesters continued chanting, and marched up and down the street. A group of protesters unfurled a banner in sympathy with the death of Lisa McPherson, and the crowd sang the happy birthday song for her.

The protest continued for an additional couple of hours as the crowd moved to a former Scientology recruiting building and then to the street level of a major mall and tourist attraction, Hollywood &amp; Highland.

After losing quite a few members the protest moved on to the front of the CNN building in hope of getting on news. 

Security was high at all Scientology installations, with security officers blocking all entrances to Church buildings, patrolling on foot and bicycle, and most taking pictures or videos of protesters (or even the Wikinews reporter). No police intervention was observed, though at least one or two officers were present at most times.

A protest in Manchester took place outside the Church of Scientology centre located on Deansgate, with around 100 people protesting at its peak. The protest was peaceful, with the protesters mainly sticking to waving banners and handing out flyers to passers-by. 

Protesters respected a request from the police that they should leave the area by 3pm in order to avoid blocking the area for patrons leaving the multiple bars along Deansgate at the end of the Manchester Derby (a football match between &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AManchester%20United"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AManchester%20City"&gt;Manchester City&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ).

There was a minimal police presence at the event and the Church of Scientology centre was closed by the end of the protest.

In a video posted on ♡❤YouTube♡❤, at least 75 to 100 protesters can be heard chanting "&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AXenu"&gt;Xenu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Xenu, Xenu" as they protest across the street from the Church. Cars driving by honk their horns in support of the protesters. Police can be seen parked in front of the Church.

The Scientology protest in New Orleans took place at 11:00am CST. There were 19 members of Anonymous that showed up to protest. Everything went smoothly. One police officer stopped by just to make sure that the crowd was demonstrating peacefully. Many pictures and video was taken by the assembled group as well as pictures being taken by the few Scientologists that showed up. One large woman drove incredibly fast to park behind the Scientology building at one point (the church was closed before some protesters arrived) and nearly hit two protesters. She was later spotted snapping countless pictures from the second floor. Over the course of the protests, about 5 cars ended up parked behind the building. One bald man came out to attempt to harass some protesters and was labeled a "Level 12 Paladin". He left soon after.

Eventually the two most interesting subjects of the Church of Scientology appeared, and were initially perceived as standard passerby's. When offered fliers the couple spat "What have you done?" and "What are your crimes?" at the protesters. One donned a Scientology vest and stood in front of the building, while his minion walked around taking pictures 5 inches from their faces.

There was some sparse foot traffic in the area and handouts were given to people passing by. A woman stopped by to talk to some Anonymous and stated that she had a family member who was trying to leave the CoS and was glad for the protests. A man in a truck parked and got some fliers, promising to return. About an hour later he arrived, wearing sunglasses and armed with a homemade sign, and joined the group.

An employee of the local newspaper, ♡❤The Times Picayune♡❤, stopped to speak with Anonymous for a little while. He stated that he was in the area on another story but was interested in finding out information about the protest. The Anonymous answered his questions, gave him handouts, but refused to share any personal contact information with him.

Near the end of the protest the two Scientologists decided to walk off.

An estimated 150 people separated into two primary groups protested the Church of Scientology in Philadelphia. Protests began in the area surrounding City Hall, eventually culminating around the Church located on Race Street. 

Pedestrian foot traffic was high due to a major event at the Convention Center. 

A police officer on the scene described the gathering as "the friendliest [protesters] I've ever seen."

The protesters read high level Scientology teaching that had been made public to Scientologists during the press conference and later in the day, with little visible success.

Several dozen protesters arrived across the street from the Scientology bookstore in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Side%20%28Pittsburgh%29"&gt;South Side&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to protest, carrying signs and handing out flyers. Protesters included many students, mostly hailing from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Pittsburgh"&gt;Pitt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACarnegie%20Mellon%20University"&gt;CMU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Cars honked in support, though pedestrian traffic was a bit more sparse. Two or three police officers kept an eye on protesters from inside the bookstore, but everything went smoothly.
As the high for the day was twenty degrees and with wind chill making it feel as though the temperatures were in the sub zeros; the anons cut their protest to only about four hours.

The protest in Portland seemed to have had a leader (or leader-like figure) or two, and was lawful and very well organized.

There was always yelling, sometimes intense, whenever someone entered the church. Some who entered did so smiling defiantly, some were hesitant and looked noticeably distressed.

Loud cheering erupted every time a passing by car honked (estimated 1 out of 5), this included even a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATrimet"&gt;Trimet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; bus.

8 people showed up and picketed in front of City Hall on the 2/10/2008. The reason why City Hall and not the traditional Church of Scientology is because San Antonio does not have a Scientology chapter. This being the reason many of the protesters of San Antonio went to Austin to support their cause. The protesters handed out fliers and held up informational posters and a "honk if you hate Scientology" poster. Many of the cars honked including but not limited to the Via bus system, SAPD, SAFD, and churchgoers.

San Diego drew about 80 protesters, starting an hour later than most of the other worldwide protests. The group started at the Horton Plaza shopping mall, and then moved on to the Church of Scientology building. After demonstrating there, the group moved back to the shopping mall, positioning itself on eight street corners, handing out information, flyers, and speaking with concerned bystanders. Not one, but two protesters dressed up as Xenu.

When 10 News showed up to cover the event, they refused to do an interview unless they could speak with a protester face to face. When none of the protesters agreed to this condition, a compromise was reached. A protester gave an audio interview for the station to use when putting together information about the protest.

After several protesters left, the protest moved back to the Church. Police presence was constant, but at the time of dispersal at the end of the protest several members reported being followed by Scientologists.

A worldwide day of protests against the Church of Scientology has begun in Sydney after an agglomeration of protesters at 11am in Hyde Park. A crowd of about 200 turned out to protest against the Church and its alleged violations of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ahuman%20rights"&gt;human rights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The group ♡❤Anonymous♡❤, who organized the rally, were handing out fliers to passers-by, and led various anti-Scientology chants by the crowd. The principal allegations made at the rally towards Scientology were the lack of freedom within the Church, and the excessive cost of their courses, which they believe doesn't warrant tax-exempt status. The Protest lasted until 1pm at the Church of Scientology Office in Town Hall and from there partially disbanded. The remaining protesters proceeded to the Scientology office in Broadway and started a lesser secondary protest lasting about 25 minutes.
The Church of Scientology was approached by the author for a response to the claims after the rally, but the church refused to comment.

The Toronto protest kicked off at 11:30 a.m. (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Time%20Zone"&gt;EST&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ). At least 300 attended the protest for the afternoon. Despite the wind chill of -22 at 11:00 and declining temperatures throughout the day, the protest was still robust at 2:00. The crowd later tapered down to fewer than 10 by 6:00 p.m..

One protester possessed a cap gun, however other protesters in his vicinity quickly pointed him out to the police, who confiscated it without charge.

A Church member was seen throwing rock salt at some protesters for a short period of time, but later went back into the Church.

Generally, the protest was peaceful and picketers were well behaved overall. Police allowed protesters to stand right outside the Scientology building. There were many people attempting to record the event with cameras, video cameras, and/or microphones, and several picketers were interviewed. 

The chants sometimes included "Xenu!", which left some passersby confused about whether the protest was for or against Scientology. However, the public was generally receptive to the protesters' message, particularly earlier in the day. Many cars passing by, especially taxis, honked in support, as did a fire truck and an ambulance. Most people offered flyers during the first couple of hours took them, though later on people seemed to grow tired of them. It was an enthusiastic, successful protest.

Over 200 people showed up and passed out pamphlets, chanted slogans, and covered the entire block at one point. Scientologists tried to counter-protest by unfurling a "Scientology For Peace" banner at one point, but protesters with signs blocked the banner from view. After 30 minutes, the Church took down their banner. 

People from all over the area came to support the protest. Vancouver Police sent a single cruiser on scene to monitor the situation, but after an hour it left without incident.

Another moment that should be noted is how after the crowd of protesters swelled from 20-200 participants within an hour, A van pulled up in the rear of the building where no protester was then present. Some people took notice and went down to investigate. What they saw was a number of church members piling boxes of documents and entire filing cabinets into the van. They then soon drove off with it. There were pictures taken of the van. It was as if they anticipated a break-in to their office where demonstrators could've seize documentation.

Church members, some in plain clothes and some wearing Church uniforms, videotaped protesters, tried to mingle with the protesters to disrupt the protest from within, and followed protesters away from the protest when they left.

About 20 people protested in front of the Scientology Center in Capistrangasse in Vienna's 6th district. At 12:30, half an hour after the demonstration started, individuals claiming to be
acting on government authority ordered the protest to disperse. Owing to an issue concerning
documentation the protestors decided to abandon the protest and dispersed peacefully.

<h3>&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWinnipeg"&gt;Winnipeg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;</h3>
At least 30 people showed up to protest the Church in Winnipeg. The temperature in Winnipeg on February 10 was -50 C with the wind chill.

Project Chanology states that people held signs stating, "Scientology destroys families, Why is [Lisa McPherson] dead?" and even "Honk if you think Scientology is a cult."

<h3>&lt;a href="Internet"&gt;The Internet&lt;/a&gt;</h3>
Although there was no official protest on the internet, thousands of people supported Anonymous by subscribing to the channel on the online video sharing site &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AYouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , where the numbers for the channel have doubled in 24 hours, making it the most subscribed channel on YouTube this month. However, there have also been a few comments against the protests and "Anonymous" in the comments section of the channel.

The protests were not confined to the above locations, however. Below is a selection of stories from other protests around the world.

<h1>Alan Keyes still in presidential race</h1>

&lt;a href="w%3AAlan%20Keyes"&gt;Alan Keyes&lt;/a&gt; wants everyone to know he still in the running for the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%27s"&gt;Republican Party's&lt;/a&gt; nomination for the &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20U.S.%20presidential%20election"&gt;2008 U.S. presidential election&lt;/a&gt;.

Saying that he thinks he still can win, the candidate's name has next to no recognition, a problem usually associated with independent or third party candidates. Keyes blames the media for his lack of recognition.

Keyes is centering his largely grassroots campaign in &lt;a href="w%3ATexas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, where he hopes to win the upcoming primary. At a recent campaign stop in &lt;a href="w%3ALubbock"&gt;Lubbock&lt;/a&gt;, Keyes asked voters to stick to their morals, vote for him, and let God perform a "miracle."

Dr. Keyes won no states on &lt;a href="w%3ASuper%20Tuesday"&gt;Super Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, and as of this writing has zero delegates.

Keyes is the former Ambassador to the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations. Other major candidates registered for the Republican nomination are &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Huckabee"&gt;Mike Huckabee&lt;/a&gt; (former Governor of Arkansas), &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt; (U.S. Senator from Arizona), and &lt;a href="w%3ARon%20Paul"&gt;Dr. Ron Paul&lt;/a&gt; (U.S. Representative from Texas and 1988 Libertarian Presidential nominee). Twenty-five others are also registered with the &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Elections%20Commission"&gt;Federal Elections Commission&lt;/a&gt; (FEC).

Today, &lt;a href="w%3AItaly%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; played &lt;a href="w%3AEngland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AStadio%20Flaminio"&gt;Stadio Flaminio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARome"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Wales vs. Scotland</h2>
Scotland's &lt;a href="w%3ADan%20Parks"&gt;Dan Parks&lt;/a&gt; kicked off the match at 1400 local time (&lt;a href="w%3AGreenwich%20Mean%20Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;). An error in the first line-out of the match by Scotland resulted in Wales kicking the ball along the ground to the Scotland try-line, almost leading to Wales's &lt;a href="w%3ARugby_union_positions%2310._Fly-half"&gt;fly-half&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Hook%20%28rugby%20player%29"&gt;James Hook&lt;/a&gt;, scoring a try within the first minute of the game, stopped only by Scotland's &lt;a href="w%3ARugby_union_positions%2315._Fullback"&gt;fullback&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHugo%20Southwell"&gt;Hugo Southwell&lt;/a&gt;. Scotland withstood the pressure from the following Welsh scrum, and went on to score the first points with a penalty from &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Paterson"&gt;Chris Paterson&lt;/a&gt; in the tenth minute. Wales struck back three minutes later with a try from &lt;a href="w%3AShane%20Williams"&gt;Shane Williams&lt;/a&gt;, converted by Hook, following a misjudged kick by Southwell that went straight to &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Phillips%20%28rugby%20player%29"&gt;Mike Phillips&lt;/a&gt;. Scotland were then disadvantaged by the sin-binning of &lt;a href="w%3ANathan%20Hines"&gt;Nathan Hines&lt;/a&gt;, for hitting out at &lt;a href="w%3ALee%20Byrne"&gt;Lee Byrne&lt;/a&gt; at a ruck. However, they survived their time without the &lt;a href="w%3ARugby_union_positions%234._%26amp%3B_5._Lock"&gt;lock&lt;/a&gt;, the next score not coming until a 30th minute penalty to Wales, kicked by Hook. The 32nd minute saw the loss of Scotland's skipper &lt;a href="w%3AJason%20White%20%28rugby%20player%29"&gt;Jason White&lt;/a&gt; to injury, being replaced by &lt;a href="w%3AAllister%20Hogg"&gt;Allister Hogg&lt;/a&gt;. The final points of the half came from a Paterson 43 metre penalty for Scotland, making the half-time score 10-6.

The second half began as the first had ended, with a Paterson penalty four minutes after the restart bringing Scotland to within a point of Wales. This didn't last long, however, as Hook scored and converted a try two minutes later, following a series of drives by the Welsh. Paterson kept the Scots in it with two further penalties, to make the difference only two points in the 56th minute. Wales replaced their half backs, Hook and Phillips, in the 58th minute, bringing on &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Jones%20%28rugby%20player%29"&gt;Stephen Jones&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ADwayne%20Peel"&gt;Dwayne Peel&lt;/a&gt;. Jones made his mark with a 65th minute penalty to give Wales a slightly more comfortable five point lead. Wales continued to pressure the Scots, and three minutes later, Williams grounded from mid-air with his body in touch to score a try, controversially given by the video referee, despite claims his foot had made contact with the touchline. Jones converted from this, and scored again with a 72nd minute penalty, which, despite late pressure from the Scots, proved to be the last points of the game, making the final score 30-15 to the home team.

<h2>France vs. Ireland</h2>
Ireland's &lt;a href="w%3ARonan%20O%27Gara"&gt;Ronan O'Gara&lt;/a&gt; kicked off the second match of the day at 1700 local time (&lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20European%20Time"&gt;UTC+1&lt;/a&gt;). France's first significant attack came in the third minute from a winding run by &lt;a href="w%3AAur%C3%A9lien%20Rougerie"&gt;Aurélien Rougerie&lt;/a&gt;, squeezing through the Irish line, picking up about 60 metres, forcing Ireland to give away a penalty only 25 metres out. However, &lt;a href="w%3AJean-Baptiste%20%C3%89lissalde"&gt;Jean-Baptiste Élissalde&lt;/a&gt; failed to capitalise on this early chance to score, kicking just wide. Within three minutes, France had got the ball over the try-line, but &lt;a href="w%3AJulien%20Bonnaire"&gt;Julien Bonnaire&lt;/a&gt; was held up by the Irish defence as he tried to ground. The first score came from a 15th minute turnover in a ruck, and a disguised kick from Élissalde deep into the Irish corner gave &lt;a href="w%3AVincent%20Clerc"&gt;Vincent Clerc&lt;/a&gt;, beating &lt;a href="w%3ADenis%20Leamy"&gt;Denis Leamy&lt;/a&gt; to the ball, a simple try. The conversion was kicked successfully by Élissalde. Ireland responded almost immediately, with an 18th minute penalty from O'Gara. The French again managed to break through the Irish defence only a minute later, this time a pass by &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Skrela"&gt;David Skrela&lt;/a&gt; setting up Clerc for his second try in five minutes in the same corner. This time Élissalde missed the conversion. The next points came from a second O'Gara penalty ten minutes later, to keep Ireland within a converted try's score of France. However, a 36th minute dropped pass by the fly-half led to another turnover, which initiated a move that gave Clerc his hat-trick try within the first half. The conversion was made, and no further points were scored, bringing the half-time score to 19-6.

The second half saw no score until the 49th minute of the game, when &lt;a href="w%3AC%C3%A9dric%20Heymans"&gt;Cédric Heymans&lt;/a&gt; easily gathered a ball that had rebounded off &lt;a href="w%3ABrian%20O%27Driscoll"&gt;Brian O'Driscoll&lt;/a&gt; from an Élissalde kick, bursting through the covering defence to score behind the posts, giving Élissalde an easy conversion. Seemingly out of the match, Ireland continued to battle, and were rewarded in the 58th minute with a penalty try awarded for persistent French infringing at scrums only metres from their line. O'Gara easily kicked the conversion to bring them within 13 points of the French. Ireland's hopes were raised further three minutes later when, following the introduction of &lt;a href="w%3AMick%20O%27Driscoll"&gt;Mick O'Driscoll&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARory%20Best"&gt;Rory Best&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Wallace%20%28rugby%20player%29"&gt;David Wallace&lt;/a&gt; was able to force the ball over the line. However, the conversion kick, that would've brought Ireland to within one converted try's score of France once again, was missed by O'Gara, leaving them eight points behind with 20 minutes to play. A 69th minute move by the Irish looked certain to result in another try, but it was not to be as a final pass by O'Gara to release Geordan Murphy was a foot too high and into touch. Ireland continued to put the French under intense pressure, culminating in a 75th minute penalty from O'Gara to bring the Irish score only five points behind the French. However, a tense last five minutes proved too short for the Irish, who, despite constant bombardment, were unable to break through the French line to score a final decisive try. The match ended 26-21.

<h2>Italy vs. England</h2>
Italy's &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Bortolussi"&gt;David Bortolussi&lt;/a&gt; kicked off the final match of the weekend at 1530 local time (UTC+1). England got off to a flying start when, after three minutes, &lt;a href="w%3AJonny%20Wilkinson"&gt;Jonny Wilkinson&lt;/a&gt; ran onto his own chipped ball, before passing out to &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Sackey"&gt;Paul Sackey&lt;/a&gt;, who sprinted through for the try in the Italian's corner. Wilkinson then converted to give England an early seven point lead. Italy's response came with two penalties, one in the sixth minute, the other in the 12th, scored by Bortolussi, to bring them back to within a point. The 15th minute brought a second England try, when &lt;a href="w%3AJamie%20Noon"&gt;Jamie Noon&lt;/a&gt; charged down and gathered a Bortolussi kick, before a short pass back to Wilkinson, himself making a short pass back to &lt;a href="w%3AToby%20Flood"&gt;Toby Flood&lt;/a&gt;, who ran for the corner, diving over the try-line, to set up the conversion that would take Wilkinson to a total of 1000 points for England. A missed penalty by Wilkinson in the 23rd minute kept the difference at eight points, but nine minutes later, he successfully scored his second penalty attempt, to widen the gap to 11 points. A final penalty scored by Wilkinson three minutes before the break meant the half-time score was 6-20.

The Italians began the second half well, putting pressure on England, and earning penalties, scored by Bortolussi, in the 44th and 55th minutes to bring Italy back into the game. England again increased their lead four minutes later with a third penalty score from Wilkinson. There were no more scores for the next 17 minutes, and in the 67th minute, England replaced Wilkinson with &lt;a href="w%3ADanny%20Cipriani"&gt;Danny Cipriani&lt;/a&gt;. Going into the last ten minutes, Italy were still trailing by 11 points, when &lt;a href="w%3AKaine%20Robertson"&gt;Kaine Robertson&lt;/a&gt; was stopped only by an ankle tap from Noon. Six minutes later, &lt;a href="w%3ASimon%20Picone"&gt;Simon Picone&lt;/a&gt; charged down a Cipriani kick, racing on to take the ball, running clear with it to score the try. The conversion, scored by Bortolussi, took Italy to within a try of victory, setting up an uncomfortable final three minutes for England. However, despite attempts by Italy to break through, they were unable to score the late try they needed, and the match finished 19-23.

<h1>Rebels shoot East Timor president</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Rebels%20shoot%20East%20Timor%20president&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9%20Ramos-Horta"&gt;José Ramos-Horta&lt;/a&gt;, President of &lt;a href="East%20Timor"&gt;East Timor&lt;/a&gt;, has been shot by rebel soldiers in an attack on his home near the capital of &lt;a href="w%3ADili"&gt;Dili&lt;/a&gt;. He is now undergoing treatment at the &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Darwin%20Hospital"&gt;Royal Darwin Hospital&lt;/a&gt;'s intensive care unit in &lt;a href="w%3ADarwin%2C%20Australia"&gt;Darwin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;. 

The military is blaming the shooting on rebel leader &lt;a href="w%3AAlfredo%20Reinado"&gt;Alfredo Reinado&lt;/a&gt;, who, along with another attacker, was shot and killed by the president's guards. "The attack was carried out by Alfredo's group," said military spokesman Domingos da Camara. Reinado, a former major, was charged with murder after leading rebel soldiers in the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20East%20Timor%20crisis"&gt;2006 East Timor crisis&lt;/a&gt;.

Camara said the shooting took place at 4:30 am local time, when two cars passed the president's residence in &lt;a href="w%3AAreia%20Branca"&gt;Areia Branca&lt;/a&gt;, two kilometers outside of the capital. According to Camara, the group "assaulted him, but after rapid reaction by security, his attackers fled". One of the president's guards was killed in the attack, Camara said.
Ramos-Horta's current condition is serious, but stable, according to doctors at the Royal Darwin Hospital. "This is a very traumatic and a nasty event - high-velocity, high-powered weapons shooting somebody in the chest in the abdomen are nasty injuries, but we would be very hopeful and cognoscente of a good recovery," said Len Notaras, the hospital superintendent. Notaras says he has found three bullet wounds, two in the stomach and one in the back.

The president was initially taken to a hospital at an Australian military base in Dili. He was then flown by airplane to Darwin and driven to the hospital under police escort. His sister and mother are in Darwin with him. Ramos-Horta is currently in an induced coma, and it is unclear when the doctors will begin operating.

Januario Freitas, a neighbor of the president, said his wound looked "serious". Maria Gabriela Carrascalao, the president's sister-in-law, said, "He was able to talk. We don't know how far is the damage, let's hope that he's not very, very serious."

Australian and East Timorean troops stepped up sercurity around the capital, while &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; police sealed off the road leading to Ramos-Horta's house. "UNPol is in a high state of alert in Dili," UN spokeswoman Allison Cooper said.

Local media reported that the home of Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AXanana%20Gusmao"&gt;Xanana Gusmao&lt;/a&gt; had also come under attack, but a statement released by the United Nations said Gusmao was safe in his office and working with international forces.

"The prime minister is in control of the situation," said East Timor foreign minister Zacarias da Costa. "I think the country is safe. We have the support of the Australian and &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; military here ... and I believe our own defenses are capable of handling those problems."

Australia agreed to send 120 more soldiers and up to 70 police to Dili. Australian foreign minister &lt;a href="w%3ASteven%20Smith"&gt;Steven Smith&lt;/a&gt; says the troops could be used to capture the other members of Reinado's group, who he believes attempted a coordinated assassination. "This wasn't a coincidence, this was a deliberate assassination attempt to take out the Prime Minister and the President - the two key figures in the duly elected East Timorese Government, and that's why the events of the day are effectively so shocking," Smith said.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Arab%20Emirates"&gt;United Arab Emirates&lt;/a&gt; (UAE) has started construction of its so called 'green &lt;a href="w%3Acity"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt;' which will be named &lt;a href="w%3AMasdar%20City"&gt;Masdar City&lt;/a&gt;. It is a city which is designed to have no &lt;a href="w%3ACarbon%20dioxide%20in%20the%20Earth%27s%20atmosphere"&gt;carbon emissions&lt;/a&gt;, cars, or waste. It will cost $22 billion (£11 billion) and take eight years to make. It will be able to hold a &lt;a href="w%3Apopulation"&gt;population&lt;/a&gt; of 50,000 people and 1,500 businesses. The city will cover 1,483 acres (6.00 km²).

The city was designed by &lt;a href="w%3AFoster%20and%20Partners"&gt;Foster and Partners&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3ABritish"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; company.

“No one has ever built a zero-carbon city before. Nor one producing zero waste or fully powered by renewable energy. Masdar City will accomplish all three,” said Sultan Al Jaber.

The city will have a personal electrical power supply mainly from two &lt;a href="w%3Arenewable%20energy"&gt;renewable energy&lt;/a&gt; sources: &lt;a href="w%3Awind%20turbines"&gt;wind turbines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Asolar%20panels"&gt;solar panels&lt;/a&gt;. Water will be provided through a solar-powered &lt;a href="w%3Adesalination%20plant"&gt;desalination plant&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aair%20conditioning"&gt;air conditioning&lt;/a&gt; will be provided naturally from &lt;a href="w%3Awind%20towers"&gt;wind towers&lt;/a&gt;.

It is planned to save more than $2 billion in oil over the next 25 years along with creating more than 70 000 jobs.
The immense project will be supported by a company created for it called 'Masdar Initiative', which will develop and commercialise clean energy technologies. It will also be supported by the &lt;a href="w%3AWWF"&gt;WWF&lt;/a&gt;, a global conservation charity, and it is hoped that international joint ventures will bring in more money.

Some people fear that Masdar will become a domain for the luxury development of the rich, because the city is located by &lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Dhabi"&gt;Abu Dhabi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Dhabi%20International%20Airport"&gt;Abu Dhabi International Airport&lt;/a&gt;.

Dr Al Jaber said, “We are often asked why we are setting our goal so high. Our answer is because someone must... Someone must push the envelope to create the solution that we, as a global community, so urgently require.”

In the sixth &lt;a href="w%3Aorbit"&gt;orbital&lt;/a&gt; launch of &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20in%20spaceflight"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Launch%20Services"&gt;International Launch Services&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AProton%20rocket"&gt;Proton-M&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="w%3ABriz-M"&gt;Briz-M&lt;/a&gt; rocket has launched from area 200/39 at the &lt;a href="w%3ABaikonur%20Cosmodrome"&gt;Baikonur Cosmodrome&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Kazakhstan"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt;, with the &lt;a href="Norway"&gt;Norwegian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AThor%205"&gt;Thor 5&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Acommunication%20satellite"&gt;communication satellite&lt;/a&gt; aboard. Liftoff of the 53 metre long &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n rocket occurred at 11:33 GMT, and the launch ended with the satellite's injection into a &lt;a href="w%3Ageosynchronous%20orbit"&gt;geosynchronous orbit&lt;/a&gt;, some 9 hours and 23 minutes later.

At 13:20, the second burn of the Briz-M upper stage was confirmed to have been successful. At 15:50, the third burn, and separation of the upper stage's auxiliary propellant tank, were reported to have been completed successfully. The fourth burn occurred about five hours later, and spacecraft separation followed at 20:57 GMT.

Thor 5 will be positioned at 1°W longitude, and will provide direct-to-home broadcasting services to &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;. The satellite was constructed by &lt;a href="w%3AOrbital%20Sciences%20Corporation"&gt;Orbital Sciences Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, and is based on the &lt;a href="w%3AStar-2"&gt;Star-2&lt;/a&gt; satellite bus. It will be operated by &lt;a href="w%3ATelenor"&gt;Telenor&lt;/a&gt;, and is equipped with 24 &lt;a href="w%3AKu-band"&gt;Ku-band&lt;/a&gt; transponders.

The launch was delayed from 2007 after the &lt;a href="Proton%20rocket%20fails%20during%20launch%20of%20JCSAT-11%20satellite"&gt;failure&lt;/a&gt; of another Proton rocket, and scrubbed yesterday due to a problem with the rocket's guidance system, detected shortly before fuelling.

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; presidential candidate &lt;a href="Mike%20Huckabee"&gt;Mike Huckabee&lt;/a&gt; won Saturday's &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;GOP&lt;/a&gt; caucuses in &lt;a href="Kansas"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Louisiana"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;, CNN reported earlier. Huckabee, a former minister and governor of &lt;a href="Arkansas"&gt;Arkansas&lt;/a&gt;, trailed party frontrunner &lt;a href="John%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt; by nearly 500 delegates at the beginning of the day. Kansas has pledged 36 delegates to the winner of today's contest.

Just days after winning several key states in the &lt;a href="w%3ASuper%20Tuesday%20%282008%29"&gt;Super Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; showdown, Huckabee has again demonstrated his ability to compete with McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee. Since Tuesday's surge, McCain has come under fire from various leaders of the conservative wing of his party. Some feel McCain can shore up his conservative flank by naming Huckabee his running mate for the general election in November. McCain has repeatedly called for conservative former governor &lt;a href="Mitt%20Romney"&gt;Mitt Romney&lt;/a&gt; to meet and work with him.

Though Romney, Huckabee's chief rival among conservative voters, suspended his campaign on Thursday, Huckabee says he has no plans to give McCain a clear path to the Republican nomination. Including Kansas, he has finished first in seven races this primary season.

According to CNN, Huckabee spoke at a Conservative Political Action Conference in &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; this morning and said, "I know the pundits, and I know what they say: The math doesn't work out. Well, I didn't major in math, I majored in miracles. And I still believe in those, too."

Military prosecutors at the &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20Bay%20detention%20camp"&gt;Guantanamo Bay detention camp&lt;/a&gt; announced charges on Monday against six captives they claim were involved in the planning of the &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%2C%202001%20attacks"&gt;September 11 attacks&lt;/a&gt;. The men, each facing the death penalty, will be tried in a single group.

The move could cause legal problems, since the &lt;a href="w%3APresidency%20of%20George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush Administration&lt;/a&gt; has admitted that at some of the confessions were given under torture. In 2006, a source in the Pentagon referred to several of the captives now facing prosecution as "unprosecutable" due to "the techniques" used to secure their confessions.

The administration confirmed last week that &lt;a href="w%3AKhalid%20Sheikh%20Mohammed"&gt;Khalid 
Sheikh Mohammed&lt;/a&gt; had been subjected to &lt;a href="w%3AWaterboarding"&gt;waterboarding&lt;/a&gt; - which it defines as an "&lt;a href="w%3AEnhanced%20interrogation%20techniques"&gt;Enhanced interrogation technique&lt;/a&gt;". The alleged planner of the September 11 attacks confessed to planning a number of other crimes. Included in his list of confessions were the &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Reid"&gt;failed shoe-bombing&lt;/a&gt; in England and 1993 bombing of the World Trade Centre, trying to assassinate &lt;a href="w%3AJimmy%20Carter"&gt;Jimmy Carter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Bill%20Clinton"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Pervez%20Musharraf"&gt;Pervez Musharraf&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Paul%20II"&gt;Pope John Paul II&lt;/a&gt;, the beheading of reporter &lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Pearl"&gt;Daniel Pearl&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3ABali%20nightclub%20bombing"&gt;Nightclub bombing&lt;/a&gt; in Bali, plots against oil tankers in Singapore and an oil company owned by &lt;a href="w%3AHenry%20Kissinger"&gt;Henry Kissinger&lt;/a&gt;, plans to blow up the &lt;a href="w%3APanama%20Canal"&gt;Panama Canal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHeathrow%20Airport"&gt;Heathrow Airport&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3ASears%20Tower"&gt;Sear Towers&lt;/a&gt; in Chicago, the &lt;a href="w%3AEmpire%20State%20Building"&gt;Empire State Building&lt;/a&gt; in New York and the &lt;a href="w%3ALibrary%20Tower"&gt;Library Tower&lt;/a&gt; in Los Angeles, attacks against a number of nightclubs in Thailand, shooting down an Israeli plane, destroying suspension bridges and bombing a hotel in Kenya and targets in South Korea. He also confessed to attacks and plots in Kuwait, Australia, Turkey, Japan, South Korea and Indonesia. &lt;a href="w%3AWilliam%20Glaberson"&gt;William Glaberson&lt;/a&gt; of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20New%20York%20Times"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ has suggested that the willingness to confess to every accusation presented against him might make it more difficult for prosecutors to establish the validity of his confessions.

&lt;a href="w%3AMohamed%20al-Kahtani"&gt;Mohamed al-Kahtani&lt;/a&gt;, one of sixteen people accused of being a "&lt;a href="w%3A20th%20hijacker"&gt;20th hijacker&lt;/a&gt;", has recanted his confessions that he had ties to Al Qaeda, had been sent to serve as a hijacker, and that he recognised thirty other captives as &lt;a href="w%3AOsama%20bin%20Laden%20bodyguard"&gt;bodyguards of Osama bin Laden&lt;/a&gt;. He has stated that he was tortured and his family was threatened - in order to force his confessions. A copy of his interrogation log documented that he had been subjected to almost two months of continuous sleep deprivation, with three shifts of interrogators working around the clock to keep him disoriented. His interrogation log documents that he was bound to chairs and force-fed, and administered &lt;a href="w%3Aenema"&gt;enemas&lt;/a&gt; and IVs, in order to keep his body functioning during his extended sessions..

&lt;a href="w%3AWalid%20Muhammad%20Salih%20Bin%20%27Attash"&gt;Walid bin 'Attash&lt;/a&gt; faces charges that he helped run a training camp in Lowgar, &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; that trained two of the hijackers, and that he observed airport security during a flight to &lt;a href="Malaysia"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;, to aid the hijackers.

&lt;a href="w%3ARamzi%20Binalshibh"&gt;Ramzi Binalshibh&lt;/a&gt; is accused of helping the attackers enroll in American flight schools, been in frequent communication with them helped finance their time in the United States.

&lt;a href="w%3AAli%20Abdul%20Aziz%20Ali"&gt;Ali Abdul Aziz Ali&lt;/a&gt; is alleged to have helped finance the hijackers' stay in the United States, teaching them to find hotels, use travellers' cheques and fit into Western culture.

&lt;a href="w%3AMustafa%20al-Hawsawi"&gt;Mustafa al-Hawsawi&lt;/a&gt;, originally thought to be another alias of Ali's, is likewise accused of helping the hijackers buy Western clothing, sign up for credit cards and financing their stay before the attacks.

The charges will be referred to &lt;a href="w%3ASusan%20Crawford%20%28Pentagon%29"&gt;Susan J. Crawford&lt;/a&gt;, appointed the convening authority of the &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20military%20commission"&gt;Guantanamo military commissions&lt;/a&gt; last year, to determine if there is &lt;a href="w%3AProbabale%20cause"&gt;probable cause&lt;/a&gt; for proceedings to continue.

The commissions were established in 2006, after the &lt;a href="w%3ASupreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; ruled in &lt;a href="w%3AHamdan%20v.%20Rumsfeld"&gt;Hamdan v. Rumsfeld&lt;/a&gt; that the system of tribunals was illegal, violating both International and American laws designed to ensure the fair treatment and trials of captives. The tribunals have been criticized for only being used against a handful of detainees, and not reaching a verdict on any of the cases.

A &lt;a href="w%3Aspacewalk"&gt;spacewalk&lt;/a&gt; was conducted today by &lt;a href="w%3Aastronaut"&gt;astronaut&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href="w%3ARex%20Walheim"&gt;Rex Walheim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AStanley%20G.%20Love"&gt;Stan Love&lt;/a&gt;, members of the &lt;a href="w%3ASTS-122"&gt;STS-122&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle"&gt;Space Shuttle&lt;/a&gt; crew, to install the new &lt;a href="w%3AColumbus%20module"&gt;Columbus module&lt;/a&gt; onto the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Space%20Station"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt;. 

The spacewalk, or &lt;a href="w%3Aextra-vehicular%20activity"&gt;extra-vehicular activity&lt;/a&gt; (EVA), began at 14:13 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;, with the astronauts leaving the ♡❤Quest♡❤ airlock of the Space Station, and starting work to install an attachment point on top of the ♡❤Columbus♡❤ module, to allow it to be moved by the Station's robotic arm. This was completed at 19:00, about an hour later than planned, owing to the installation taking longer than expected. ♡❤Columbus♡❤ was lifted out of the payload bay of &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Atlantis"&gt;♡❤Atlantis♡❤&lt;/a&gt; at 19:55 UTC, by the Space Station's robotic arm, &lt;a href="w%3ACanadarm2"&gt;Canadarm2&lt;/a&gt;. Astronaut &lt;a href="w%3ADan%20Tani"&gt;Dan Tani&lt;/a&gt;, controlling Canadarm2 from aboard the ISS remarked "Columbus has started its trip to the new world". At 21:29, ♡❤Columbus♡❤ soft-docked with the Space Station's &lt;a href="w%3AHarmony%20%28ISS%20module%29"&gt;♡❤Harmony♡❤&lt;/a&gt; node, and the module finished bolting itself in place by 21:44.

Meanwhile, the astronauts performed some tasks to prepare for the next spacewalk, which is currently scheduled for Wednesday. They loosened bolts holding a nitrogen tank in place on the port truss segment of the Station, ahead of its replacement. It was originally planned that they would also disconnect pipes and electrical connections, however these objectives were delayed to Wednesday's spacewalk, due to time constraints. The EVA finished at 22:12 UTC, having lasted seven hours and fifty-eight minutes

This marks the 102 spacewalk as part of the International Space Station programme, and the first of three planned for the STS-122 Shuttle mission. It was originally planned that &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; astronaut &lt;a href="w%3AHans%20Schlegel"&gt;Hans Schlegel&lt;/a&gt; would perform the EVA instead of Stan Love, however he was unable to do so due to an undisclosed medical problem.

The city of &lt;a href="w%3AKiryat%20Yam"&gt;Kiryat Yam&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; is suing Internet corporation &lt;a href="Google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; over an alleged inaccuracy in its &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle%20Earth"&gt;Google Earth&lt;/a&gt; software, which claims the city was built over the ruins of an &lt;a href="w%3AArab"&gt;Arab&lt;/a&gt; village.

A note added by Google Earth user Thameen Darby says Kiryat Yam was built on the site of the Palestinian village Ghawarina. 

However, town's spokesman Naty Key Zilberman says this "obviously cannot be true, because Kiryat Yam was founded in 1945". The &lt;a href="w%3A1948%20Palestinian%20exodus"&gt;Palestinian exodus&lt;/a&gt;, in which hundreds of thousands of Arabs abandoned their villages due to the &lt;a href="w%3A1948%20Arab-Israeli%20War"&gt;Arab-Israeli War&lt;/a&gt;, occurred in 1948, three years after Key zilberman says the city was founded. The city filed a slander complaint with Israel police, he says.

The city's claim is supported by Yossi Ben-Artzi, a history professor at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Haifa"&gt;University of Haifa&lt;/a&gt;, who said, "Kiryat Yam was built on sand dunes, and there wasn't any Palestinian village in the area. The lands were bought in 1939 by the Gav Yam construction company."

Darby, the Palestinian doctor who added the information, says his contributions are part of the "Nakhba — Palestinian Catastrophe" hub, which intends to help Palestinian refugees find the villages of their ancestors. "As far as I can know, the Arab Ghawarina locality was in the place depicted," Darby said, though he also says he will "be quick to reallocate it" if proven wrong by reliable sources.

An unnamed Google spokesman said in an email: "Content reflects what people contribute, not what Google believes to be true. ... While we recognize that some may find the user-generated content objectionable, we are careful to balance the integrity of an open forum with the legal requirements of local governments. If an overlay does not breach our Terms and Conditions and is not in any way illegal, it is our policy not to remove it."

A motion has been passed in the &lt;a href="w%3AParliament%20of%20Australia"&gt;Parliament of Australia&lt;/a&gt; to make a formal apology to the &lt;a href="w%3AStolen%20Generations"&gt;Stolen Generations&lt;/a&gt;. Thousands of people converged on &lt;a href="w%3ACanberra"&gt;Canberra&lt;/a&gt;, the capital city, to witness the event. Many Indigenous people set up camp on the lawns outside &lt;a href="w%3AOld%20Parliament%20House%2C%20Canberra"&gt;Old Parliament House&lt;/a&gt; at the site of the &lt;a href="w%3AAboriginal%20Tent%20Embassy"&gt;Tent Embassy&lt;/a&gt; which has been on the site since &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia%20Day"&gt;Australia Day&lt;/a&gt; 1972.

The front doors of Parliament House opened at 7:30 a.m. with many people queuing from before 7 a.m. to gain a place inside. With the House of Representatives public gallery packed, about a thousand people watched a live telecast of the event on screens that had been set up for the event in the Great Hall. A special area was set up at the front of the Hall for members of the Stolen Generation. Thousands of others watched outside Parliament House, gathering on the lawns of Federation Square. Some members of the crowds wore t-shirts with the word "Thanks" on the front. Many more people watched at venues across the country.

All living past Prime Ministers, with the exception of John Howard, were in the chamber to witness the apology.

The Prime Minister's speech was received warmly by the crowds and received a long standing ovation at its conclusion. During the Opposition Leader's speech, a majority of the audience in the Great Hall and Federation Square turned their backs. 
<h2>The Apology</h2>

The motion was presented to the house as the first item of business at 9 a.m. on the second day of the new Parliament. It was read by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and said (in part):

After the formal apology, Rudd gave a speech in which he referred to specific members of the Stolen Generation, and also addressed some common arguments against the apology. 

He told the story of Nanna Nungala Fejo, an Aboriginal woman born in the late 1920's. "She remembers her earliest childhood days living with her family and her community in a bush camp just outside Tennant Creek. She remembers the love and the warmth and the kinship of those days long ago, including traditional dancing around the camp fire at night. She loved the dancing," Mr Rudd said. "But then, sometime around 1932, when she was about four, she remembers the coming of the welfare men ... What they had not expected was that the white welfare men did not come alone. They brought a truck, two white men and an Aboriginal stockman on horseback cracking his stockwhip. The kids were found; they ran for their mothers, screaming, but they could not get away ... Tears flowing, her mum tried clinging to the sides of the truck as her children were taken away to the Bungalow in Alice, all in the name of protection."

Mr Rudd criticised the former government for refusing to apologise. "These stories cry out to be heard; they cry out for an apology. Instead, from the nation’s parliament there has been a stony, stubborn and deafening silence for more than a decade," he said.

<h2>Responses</h2>
Opposition Leader &lt;a href="Brendan%20Nelson"&gt;Brendan Nelson&lt;/a&gt; spoke in Parliament after Kevin Rudd. He reiterated the apology made by Rudd. "We formally offer an apology to those Aboriginal people forcibly removed from their families through the first seven decades of the twentieth century," he said. 

Nelson had a different take on the issue of inter-generational responsibility. "Our generation does not own these actions, nor should it feel guilt for what was done in many, but not all cases, with the best of intentions," he said. "But in saying we are sorry - and deeply so - we remind ourselves that each generation lives in ignorance of the long term consequences of its decisions and actions. Even when motivated by inherent humanity and decency to reach out to the dispossessed in extreme adversity, our actions can have unintended outcomes." 

Nelson spoke against compensation to children forcibly removed from their parents. "There is no compensation fund, nor should there be. How can any sum of money replace a life deprived of knowing your family?"

In the Great Hall the crowd grew uncomfortable during the Opposition Leader's speech and the majority of the audience stood and turned their backs to the screens on which he was being broadcast. As the speech progressed a slow clapping began which drowned out Dr. Nelson's speech.

The crowds in Federation Square, the gardens outside Parliament House, also turned their back on the Opposition Leader.

One of the first to stand and turn his back in the Great Hall was Chris Osborne, representing the State Executive of the United Services Union of N.S.W. Mr. Osborne told a Wikinews reporter that his son had Aboriginal heritage and his sister-in-law was a member of the Stolen Generations. Regarding Dr Nelson's speech he said that the Opposition Leader "had not learnt and understood the fundamental issues" and said that he had presented a "begrudging apology".

A member of the Stolen Generations interviewed by Wikinews said that she had personally resolved the issues in her life and had made a success of it, but was pleased that the Nation had made the apology. She said that she did not turn her back on the Opposition Leader as she believed that it was better to listen to what people said and then take from it what was useful. Another Indigenous person said that he felt that people would leave the event with a spirit of hope and optimism. Of Dr. Nelson's speech he said that the Opposition Leader: "...had us for a nano-second and then he lost us. He lost the spirit."

<h2>Live telecast</h2>

Thousands of people gathered throughout the country to watch a telecast of the apology. 

In Sydney, 1,000 people gathered the Redfern Community Centre in &lt;a href="w%3ARedfern%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Redfern&lt;/a&gt;, an inner city suburb that is a focal point for Sydney's aboriginal community. The event was organised by the &lt;a href="w%3ACity%20of%20Sydney"&gt;City of Sydney&lt;/a&gt; and number of Indigenous organisations.

An aboriginal &lt;a href="w%3Asmoking%20ceremony"&gt;smoking ceremony&lt;/a&gt; was performed before the telecast, and attendees were welcomed to the land by a member of the Metropolitan Local Aboriginal Land Council. 

As the live telecast began it started to rain. This didn't deter the participants, who sheltered under ponchos and umbrellas. Rudd's apology was met by cheers and applause. The crowd booed at the mention of former Prime Minister &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt;. 

The sound of the live telecast was turned down after Rudd's speech, so that the Lord Mayor of the &lt;a href="w%3ACity%20of%20Sydney"&gt;City of Sydney&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Clover%20Moore"&gt;Clover Moore&lt;/a&gt; could speak. She acknowledged the traditional owners of the land and declared her support for the apology, but also said that it was a first step only and that there was much work to be done on the way to reconciliation. "For the first time, we have acknowledged the history of this country, and the privilege to live in this country," she said. "But we have to ask ourselves: what's the cost of that privilege? Who paid the price?"

"In our hearts we know the costs, whether in child-abuse, in petrol sniffing in remote communities, and drugs, and alcohol in the city districts."

The &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n parliament will apologise tomorrow for past mistreatment of Australia's indigenous population. The wording of the apology will be revealed after 5pm &lt;a href="w%3ATime%20in%20Australia"&gt;AEDT&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC%2B11"&gt;UTC+11&lt;/a&gt;) today, and will be read in parliament tomorrow at 9am AEDT. 

Opposition leader &lt;a href="Brendan%20Nelson"&gt;Brendan Nelson&lt;/a&gt; has given in-principle support to an apology, but has criticised the government for the delay in releasing the wording. He has written his speech without seeing the apology. 

"If Mr Rudd wants to unify Australia, to bring our nation together, the most important person he should be negotiating with is me," Mr Nelson said yesterday. "We're two days away from this, for goodness sake. He should be sitting down with me and saying 'these are the words which we propose, what do you think?" 

Prime Minister &lt;a href="Kevin%20Rudd"&gt;Kevin Rudd&lt;/a&gt; said that the words must be tabled to parliament first. 

The Government's manager of business, &lt;a href="Anthony%20Albanese"&gt;Anthony Albanese&lt;/a&gt;, said that it was more important for members of the &lt;a href="w%3AStolen%20Generation"&gt;Stolen Generation&lt;/a&gt;s to approve of the apology. "Quite frankly, what's important is the people most affected are comfortable with that wording," he said. 

In an opinion piece in today's ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Sydney%20Morning%20Herald"&gt;The Sydney Morning Herald&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, &lt;a href="Tony%20Abbott"&gt;Tony Abbott&lt;/a&gt; defended &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt;'s legacy. "Its refusal to say 'sorry' meant that Howard never received the credit he deserved for groundbreaking policies such as the intervention in Northern Territory Aboriginal townships," Mr Abbott wrote. "The Liberal Party's decision to support an apology to stolen children is not a repudiation of John Howard. It should help us to defend a key part of his legacy, the Northern Territory intervention, and to pursue good policy without accusations of bad faith."

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
According to radio communications by the Buffalo, &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; Fire Department, at approximately 10:15 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Time%20Zone"&gt;EST&lt;/a&gt; two water pipes inside the &lt;a href="w%3ADarwin%20D.%20Martin%20House"&gt;Darwin D. Martin House&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Historic%20Landmark"&gt;National Historical Landmark&lt;/a&gt;, broke causing several rooms to flood.

The breaks were discovered in the gift shop area of the house but quickly began to flood other areas near the shop as firefighters had a difficult time locating the main shut off valves.

At 10:50 p.m., firefighters reported to have shut off "several main valves" stopping the flow of water. The cost of the water damage is not known, but covered several rooms. Recent sub-zero temperatures in the city is said to be the cause of the break. At the time of the call, the temperature was only 10°F with a wind chill of 4°F above zero. On Sunday the temperature was only 3°F with a wind chill of -23°F.

The house, designed by &lt;a href="w%3AFrank%20Lloyd%20Wright"&gt;Frank Lloyd Wright&lt;/a&gt;, has seen rough times over the years, experiencing problems such as vandalism. The first half of the complex was built in 1903 and finished in 1905. After the pergola, conservatory, and carriage were demolished, restoration and rebuild began in 1992 and is scheduled for completion in 2008 or 2009.

This year, four breeds of dogs are competing for the first time in the &lt;a href="w%3AWestminster%20Kennel%20Club%20Dog%20Show"&gt;Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show&lt;/a&gt;, at &lt;a href="w%3AMadison%20Square%20Garden"&gt;Madison Square Garden&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="New%20York%2C%20New%20York"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.

The new breeds making their Westminister debuts this year, are the &lt;a href="w%3APlott%20Hound"&gt;Plott&lt;/a&gt;, a hunting hound originally bred by two &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; immigrant brothers in &lt;a href="North%20Carolina"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a href="w%3ATibetan%20Mastiff"&gt;Tibetan Mastiff&lt;/a&gt;, once described by &lt;a href="w%3AMarco%20Polo"&gt;Marco Polo&lt;/a&gt; as "tall as a donkey with a voice as powerful as that of a lion."; the &lt;a href="w%3ABeauceron"&gt;Beauceron&lt;/a&gt;, a herding dog originally bred to herd flocks of sheep in &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, later used to sniff out landmines and send messages during the World Wars; and the &lt;a href="w%3ASwedish%20Vallhund"&gt;Swedish Vallhund&lt;/a&gt;, a breed dating back to the time of the &lt;a href="w%3AVikings"&gt;Vikings&lt;/a&gt;, used on farms to catch vermin, herd cattle, and as a guard dog, noted for its double coat and harness markings. 

This brings the number of unique breeds competing in the famous dog show to 169. 

The Plott, the Beauceron, and the Vallhund were shown on Monday. The Tibetan Mastiff will be shown tonight as part of the Working Group.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=2008%20Taipei%20International%20Book%20Exhibition%20Preview%3A%20An%20exposition%20with%20different%20cultures&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="2008%20Taipei%20International%20Book%20Exhibition"&gt;2008 Taipei International Book Exhibition&lt;/a&gt; (TIBE 2008), organized by the Taipei Book Fair Foundation (TBFF), will start tomorrow and end next Monday (Feb. 18) at the &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20World%20Trade%20Center"&gt;Taipei World Trade Center&lt;/a&gt; in Hall 1 &amp; 3 and in the Taipei Show (TWTC Hall 2). Before the opening of the main show, the TIBE changed significantly.

<h3>Return of the preview exhibition before the main show</h3>

Since the Preview Exhibition was held in 1992 in &lt;a href="w%3AJhonghe%20City"&gt;Jhonghe City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20County"&gt;Taipei County&lt;/a&gt; with the "History of books in China" theme, the preview exhibition wasn't eventually held before the main show every year.

This pre-main-show exhibition style was replaced by a consuming battle between bookstores from actual to virtual (via Internet) and reading festivals from municipal libraries in Taiwan that the &lt;a href="w%3AMinistry%20of%20Education%20%28Republic%20of%20China%29"&gt;Ministry of Education of the Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; promoted. But in 2008, after the TBFF was regrouped last year, the preview exhibition finally returned on Feb 2 &amp; 3 with the "Book Market" and "&lt;a href="w%3AArts%20and%20crafts"&gt;Arts and Crafts&lt;/a&gt;" in the &lt;a href="w%3Azh%3A%E8%8F%AF%E5%B1%B1%E6%96%87%E5%8C%96%E5%9C%92%E5%8D%80"&gt;Huashan Culture Park&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei"&gt;Taipei&lt;/a&gt;. With the preview exhibition, the reading population is expected to expand rapidly and widely in Taiwan.

<h3>Showcases with varied cultures in different countries</h3>

To gather on different cultures, the TBFF not only arranged a variety of seminars from book-cover designing, changes of publishing industry, publishing style, and strategies from global publishing industry, but also invited executives from the publishing industry worldwide such as &lt;a href="w%3Afr%3AMichel%20Le%20Bris"&gt;Michel Le Bris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Afr%3AGilles%20Lapouge"&gt;Gilles Lapouge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AShaun%20Tan"&gt;Shaun Tan&lt;/a&gt;, Markus Zusak, Tony Wheeler, and Maruen Wheeler and executives from the &lt;a href="w%3AFrankfurt%20Book%20Fair"&gt;Frankfurt Book Fair&lt;/a&gt;.

Apart from seminars and executives, the &lt;a href="w%3Ade%3AStiftung%20Buchkunst"&gt;Stiftung Buchkunst (Book Art Foundation)&lt;/a&gt; will showcase several awarded books from "Giant of Japanese Design" and some book design awards in the "Most Beautiful Book Designing" pavilion. Two book design awards by TBEE named the "2008 TIBE Prize" and "2008 Golden Butterfly Award" will be successively announced on Feb 13 &amp; 14.

Not only on book-designing and pavilions, even though &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; was named as the main international pavilion, the TBFF chose the opening movie ♡❤"What My Eyes Have Seen"♡❤ from &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; and a closing movie named ♡❤"&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Edge%20of%20Heaven%20%28film%29"&gt;The Edge of Heaven&lt;/a&gt;"♡❤ from &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, those selected movies including the opening and closing ones will be screened at the movie pavilion. The Travel Literature Pavilion will show a different style varied from the 2007 Taipei International Travel Fair, not only just about traveling but also mixed with cultures and literature.

As many publishing executives, companies, and world-wide media anticipated for the &lt;a href="2008%20Taipei%20International%20Book%20Exhibition"&gt;2008 Taipei International Book Exhibition&lt;/a&gt; (TIBE 2008), the fair joined the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Publishers%20Association"&gt;International Publishers Association&lt;/a&gt; (IPA) as their member after permission by the IPA last Tuesday (Feb. 5) and the Taipei Book Fair Foundation (TBFF) held a contract-signing ceremony today for the partnership program between IPA and TIBE at the press conference of TIBE 2008.

Director of the Government Information Office of the Republic of the China Jhy-Wey Shieh said after the signing:

After the contract-signing, members from the TBFF will have opportunities to gain experiences from publishing industry and world-class book expositions in several countries, and the publishing industry in Taiwan will be improved progressively in the future.

&lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt;, the junior senator from &lt;a href="Illinois"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt; and 2008 US presidential candidate has swept all three of today's Democratic contests in the "&lt;a href="w%3APotomac%20primaries"&gt;Potomac primaries&lt;/a&gt;" consisting of the nation's capital, &lt;a href="Washington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; and the bordering states of &lt;a href="Virginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Maryland"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt;. 

Obama led in the Virginia polls 67 percent, while in the District of Columbia, he lead 76 percent over opponent, &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; senator &lt;a href="Hillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt;'s 24 percent. This sweep gives him a slight lead over Clinton in the delegate count. Meanwhile, the Clinton campaign lost an aide today, as campaign aide Mike Henry resigned making light of a small staffing crisis within the campaign as Clinton just replaced her campaign manager &lt;a href="w%3APatty%20Solis%20Doyle"&gt;Patty Solis Doyle&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="w%3AMaggie%20Williams"&gt;Maggie Williams&lt;/a&gt;. Doyle remains with the campaign as a senior advisor.

Meanwhile, &lt;a href="John%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt;, the senator from &lt;a href="Arizona"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt; and 2008 US presidential candidate has swept all three of today's Republican contests in the Potomac primaries. McCain obtained a slim margin of victory over opponent, former &lt;a href="Arkansas"&gt;Arkansas&lt;/a&gt; Governor &lt;a href="Mike%20Huckabee"&gt;Mike Huckabee&lt;/a&gt; in Virginia and had a lead over Huckabee by nine points in the District.

In the early hours of Tuesday, &lt;a href="Denmark"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3APolitiets%20Efterretningstjeneste"&gt;Politiets Efterretningstjeneste&lt;/a&gt; (PET) (Danish Security Intelligence Service), arrested three people for their connection to an alleged plot to murder one of the cartoonists from the &lt;a href="w%3AJyllands-Posten%20Muhammad%20cartoons%20controversy"&gt;♡❤Jyllands-Posten♡❤ Muhammad cartoons controversy&lt;/a&gt;.

On September 30, 2005, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AJyllands-Posten"&gt;Jyllands-Posten&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ a Danish newspaper, published twelve cartoons depicting the prophet &lt;a href="w%3AMuhammad"&gt;Muhammad&lt;/a&gt;. The paper solicited the cartoons for an article that explored "self-censorship" with regards to &lt;a href="w%3ACriticism%20of%20Islam"&gt;criticism&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Islam"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;. One of the cartoonists that responded was &lt;a href="w%3AKurt%20Westergaard"&gt;Kurt Westergaard&lt;/a&gt;, who contributed an image of Muhammed with a &lt;a href="w%3Aturban"&gt;turban&lt;/a&gt; that looks like a bomb.

PET says that Westergaard was the target of an alleged plot to murder him. At 4:30 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20European%20Time"&gt;CET&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC%2B1"&gt;UTC+1&lt;/a&gt;), in a pre-dawn raid, they arrested three men in &lt;a href="w%3AAarhus"&gt;Aarhus&lt;/a&gt;, Denmark. The men, two &lt;a href="Tunisia"&gt;Tunisia&lt;/a&gt;ns and one Danish citizen of &lt;a href="Morocco"&gt;Moroccan&lt;/a&gt; origin, are suspected of planning to kill Westergaard.

PET commissioner Jakob Scharf said, "The purpose of the clampdown was to prevent a terror- related homicide. The clampdown occurred after a long period of surveillance."

The Danish citizen has been released. It is thought that this means that the evidence against him is not very strong. However, the 40-year-old man "will continue to be of interest for the PET" says Scharf.

The two other men, said to be 25 and 36 years of age, and who by all accounts were in Denmark legally, face deportation back to Tunisia. They are due to remain in custody until a judge can review their case on Thursday. "I have no idea about what is going to happen next. The ball is in the court of PET, and they are they ones who need to start talking and explain the meaning of all this. I have no idea what the next step is," said the public defender assigned to the Tunisians.

The government and the PET has yet to present their case in court. As a result, it is unknown what evidence there is of a plot. Also, it is unknown if the men were under orders from groups outside of Denmark, as has been speculated by media.

However, Scharf says that the pre-emptive police action "was to prevent a planned killing of one of the cartoonists behind the Muhammed-drawings." The primary objective was not to jail or deport anyone, but to prevent a murder.

The Prime Minister of Denmark, &lt;a href="w%3AAnders%20Fogh%20Rasmussen"&gt;Anders Fogh Rasmussen&lt;/a&gt;, commented: "Unfortunately, this case shows, that in Denmark, too, there are groups of extremists, who do not recognize and respect the founding principles upon which the Danish people's government is built."

Meanwhile, the editors-in-chief at the three biggest newspapers in Denmark have seen the alleged plot as a threat to their freedom of speech. These papers are ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AJyllands-Posten"&gt;Jyllands-Posten&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3APolitiken"&gt;Politiken&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ og ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABerlingske%20Tidende"&gt;Berlingske Tidende&lt;/a&gt;. ♡❤ To reassert their rights they all plan to republish the controversial Muhammad drawings on Wednesday.

"We must in Danish media send a clear and unambiguous message to all, that might get the same insane thoughts, as those who would attack Kurt Westergaard," says ♡❤Berlingske Tidende♡❤ chief-editor Lisbeth Knudsen.

Westergaard, who is 73 years old, has been under police protection since he received death-threats shortly after the original publication of the cartoons. "I fear for my life, when the police tell me there are certain people who are working with concrete plans to kill me," he says.

<h1>Finnish internet censorship critic blacklisted</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Finnish%20internet%20censorship%20critic%20blacklisted&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="Finland"&gt;Finnish&lt;/a&gt; police have added Finnish hacker Matti Nikki's website &lt;a href="w%3Alapsiporno.info"&gt;lapsiporno.info&lt;/a&gt; criticizing Internet censorship to Finland’s new national child porn filter. The blacklisting was noticed when Finland's second largest Internet service provider &lt;a href="w%3AElisa%20Oyj"&gt;Elisa&lt;/a&gt; started blocking the page today. More of the ISP's are expected to join the filtering when their blacklists are updated from the police's master list. 

The banned site has been a harsh critic of Internet censorship over the last three years. It contains information and news about how censorship has been discussed and developing in Finland. Although the site's provocative name is lapsiporno.info ("childporn.info") there is no child porn on the site - the content is mainly text.

Tekniikka &amp; Talous magazine asked Commissioner Lars Henriksson of Finland's &lt;a href="w%3AKeskusrikospoliisi"&gt;National Bureau of Investigation&lt;/a&gt; (NBI) why the page was censored. His answer was that he cannot discuss individual sites, but said that sites which are linking to child porn pages are also within the scope of the law. This interpretation, however, seems to conflict with the actual laws, the scope of which was supposed to be only sites with illegal pictures in foreign countries. 

On Wednesday, NBI confirmed that site was censored because it published and maintained an incomplete version of the Finnish child porn blacklist. Nikki's list contained roughly two-thirds of the 1500 blacklist entries, and it was created by scanning a large amount of sites and logging the censored pages. 

The scan also found that the top three results of a &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; search for "gay porn" are blacklisted, and that most of the blocked sites are actually physically located in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;. 

Leena Romppainen of &lt;a href="w%3AElectronic%20Frontier%20Finland"&gt;Electronic Frontier Finland&lt;/a&gt; commented that "The local authorities have taken no action on these sites. Therefore, either the sites do not contain child pornography or the NBI has not informed the local authorities. Both of the alternatives are equally scary." 

Matti Nikki's opinion is that the majority of the censored sites are legal adult sites and that the police are not doing that much research when they are deciding which sites to block. 

Internet censorship has been a hot topic in Finland as of late. There have been proposals of extending Internet filtering to Internet gambling sites, sites related to terrorism and violence, and torrent-tracker &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Pirate%20Bay"&gt;The Pirate Bay&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Lucas"&gt;George Lucas&lt;/a&gt; has announced that there will be one last ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AStar%20Wars"&gt;Star Wars&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ movie to end the saga, but it won't have any actors visible.

♡❤Star Wars: The Clone Wars♡❤, an animated film is scheduled to be released into theaters on August 15 of this year.

"I felt there were a lot more 'Star Wars' stories left to tell. I was eager to start telling some of them through animation and, at the same time, push the art of animation forward," said Lucas in a statement to the media.

Lucas says that although the film is animated, people can expect the same kind of galactic space battles and action that all the other ♡❤Star Wars♡❤ films have. The approximate running time of the film is 100 minutes.

The film is produced by &lt;a href="w%3AWarner%20Brothers"&gt;Warner Brothers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALucasfilm"&gt;Lucasfilm LTD&lt;/a&gt;. The new movie is also set to continue as an animated, 30 minute "mini-movie" series this &lt;a href="w%3Aautumn"&gt;autumn&lt;/a&gt;. The show can be seen on the &lt;a href="w%3ACartoon%20Network"&gt;Cartoon Network&lt;/a&gt;.

What is the fulcrum in Mr. West's life that led him to realize a talent to shape personalities with his voice, and how did the discovery of that gift shape him? Wikinews reporter found that like many great comedians, West faced more sour early in life than he did sweet. The sour came from a physically and emotionally abusive alcoholic father ("I could tell you the kind of night I was going to have from the sound of the key in the door or the way the car pulled up."), to his own problems with drug and alcohol use ("There is a point that you can reach in your life where you don’t want to live, but you haven’t made the decision to die.").
If sin, suffering and redemption feel like the stages of an endless cycle of American existence, West's own redemption from his brutalized childhood is what helped shape his gift. He performed little bits to cheer up his cowed mother, ravaged by the fact she could not stop her husband's abuse of young West. "I was the whipping boy and she would just be reduced to tears a lot of times, and I would come in and say stuff, and I would put out little bits just to pull her out of it."

But West has also enjoyed the sweet. His career blossomed as his talent for creating entire histories behind fictional characters and creatures simply by exploring nuance in his voice landed him at the top of his craft. You may never again be able to forget that behind the voice of your favorite character, there is often an extraordinary life. 

Below is 's interview with renowned voice actor Billy West, who for the first time publicly talks about the horrors he faced in his childhood; his misguided search for answers in anger, drugs and alcohol; and the peace he has achieved as one of America's most recognizable voice actors.

<h2>The use of celebrities for voiceovers</h2>
♡❤♡: You’re known for speaking about the use of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACelebrity"&gt;famous actors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to do &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVoice-over"&gt;voice-over&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . What is your central problem with their use?

♡❤♡DS: What standards are those?

♡❤♡DS: Like &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARobin%20Williams"&gt;Robin Williams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ?

♡❤♡DS: &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJerry%20Seinfeld"&gt;Jerry Seinfeld&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as well in ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABee%20Movie"&gt;Bee Movie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤?

♡❤♡DS: What’s the solution? Not to do characters around stars?

♡❤♡DS: They’ll have you come in, or someone of your caliber come in, and actually shape the voice around the character and then they’ll present it to the celebrity as the template?

♡❤♡DS: Are you paid for that?

♡❤♡DS: Are there legal remedies that you could pursue for that?

♡❤♡DS: There was a similar issue involved with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACrispin%20Glover"&gt;Crispin Glover&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . They had taken a likeness of one of his earlier roles. I think it was &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Zemeckis"&gt;Robert Zemeckis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Then they tried to pass it off later as him and he sued them for doing that. Are you familiar with that situation?

♡❤♡DS: He did.

♡❤♡DS: Has your speaking out on this issue hurt you in any way?

♡❤♡DS: In your career?

♡❤♡DS: There’s no reaction against it from the studios or from the ….?

<h2>Iconic characters and choosing projects</h2>
♡❤♡DS: You discussed in an interview issues about the weight of the character’s legacies, such as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APop-Eye"&gt;Pop-Eye&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABugs%20Bunny"&gt;Bugs Bunny&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . You had said that every time they do one of these they say, 'this time it’s going to be different. We’re putting the teeth back in those characters. Nobody is going to tell us what we can’t write and what we can write.' And you said they always blow it. How do they blow it?

♡❤♡DS: How do you choose a project, or does the project choose you?

♡❤♡DS: Where do you think voice acting is going? It doesn’t seem like it’s ever an art that’s going to lose its place, but do you see it diminishing? Is it on a downturn? Is it on an upturn? Is it idling?

♡❤♡DS: With computer animated voices?

<h2>Discovering his talent</h2>
♡❤♡DS: Do you remember a time in your life when you started recognizing your talent for being able to shape your voice into memorable characters?

♡❤♡DS: You had a talent that seemed very trite to you, but very few other people could do it and you didn't recognize that?

♡❤♡DS: You would feel a compulsion to do the plays in a voice?

♡❤♡DS: I’m not a voice actor, but there’s times I’ll hear a person say a phrase. I covered the &lt;a href="Protests%20mark%20Ahmadinejad%27s%20visit%20to%20Columbia%20University"&gt;Iranian president speaking at Colombia&lt;/a&gt; for ♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and I watched these dueling ideologues who were normal citizens. One of them was this large black woman with a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABible"&gt;Bible&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; yelling at this &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASecular%20Jew"&gt;secular Jewish&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; guy. I recorded these voices. She had one of those voices that I just couldn’t get out of my head. She just kept going, “You’re evil. You’re going to burn in Hell.” I found myself saying it aloud over and over and over again because her voice and what she said made such an impression on me that I wanted to imitate it. There was such a history behind that voice. She probably could have just said, “Buy &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATide%20detergent"&gt;Tide detergent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ,” and I would still be saying it over and over and over again.

<h2>"It was a horror chamber where I grew up"</h2>
♡❤♡DS: Is how you developed your talent when you were younger based upon imitating others? You would hear things that would leave impressions on you and you would want to imitate them? But ♡❤why♡❤ would you want to imitate them?

♡❤♡DS: It was escapism ...?

♡❤♡DS: So when you would escape into those voices, you felt a sense of safety?

♡❤♡DS: And things that you could control through your own voice.

♡❤♡DS: Whereas you couldn’t control what an alcoholic authority figure was going to do.

♡❤♡DS: What was your dad’s reaction to your doing voices?

♡❤♡DS: Where was your mom during all this?

<h2>West moves to Boston after his parents divorce</h2>
♡❤♡DS: It doesn’t sound like she was very successful.

♡❤♡DS: When did you come to a realization that your voice was something that you wanted to turn into a career?

♡❤♡DS: Did you say &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Afay"&gt;fay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Afaggot"&gt;faggot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ?

♡❤♡DS: Do you think that’s had any lasting effect on you?

♡❤♡DS: They say that all great comedians typically have extraordinary tragedy in their lives, and they develop their humor as a response to it.

♡❤♡DS: Even though you were hurting, it would hurt you to see her hurting over you.

♡❤♡DS: What made you the whipping boy?

♡❤♡DS: What would make you the one that he would unleash that upon as opposed to your brothers? 

♡❤♡DS: Like what?

♡❤♡DS: An &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aoedipal"&gt;oedipal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; issue?

♡❤♡DS: What is your relationship with your brothers like? Did they see this going on? Did they feel bad for you?

<h2>How West dealt with his father's abuse</h2>
♡❤♡DS: You said your father was a victim of abuse himself and that pattern often repeats. How did you stop that pattern? Was it through your voice work?

♡❤♡DS: How so?

<h2>Rehabilitation and sobriety</h2>
♡❤♡DS: How did you stop the fights and the drugs?

♡❤♡DS: Are you still &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASobriety"&gt;sober&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ?

♡❤♡DS: Were you at a point where you didn’t necessarily want to die, but you just didn’t care if you lived?

♡❤♡DS: Whatever happens happens.

♡❤♡DS: And that would almost egg you on?

♡❤♡DS: Now it’s all electronic.

<h2>Is West glad he experienced addiction?</h2>
♡❤♡DS: Are you in some way glad that you went through the drug and alcohol abuse?

♡❤♡DS: Do you believe in a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHigher%20Power"&gt;higher power&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ?

♡❤♡DS: Me too.

♡❤♡DS: I didn’t know the mass in Latin, but I was an altar boy and I had Catholicism shoved down my face, but I’m 33, so &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASecond%20Vatican%20Council"&gt;Vatican II&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; had happened.

♡❤♡DS: The priest at my church got a nun pregnant and my mother, who was the president of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AParent-Teacher%20Association"&gt;PTA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at my Catholic grade school, helped deliver the baby and keep the whole thing hidden.

♡❤♡DS: Yeah. And he’s still the priest.

<h2>West on his career</h2>
♡❤♡DS: Where do you see yourself now in your career?

♡❤♡DS: At what point was that for you?

<h2>West on politics</h2>
[♡❤continued from previous section♡❤]

♡❤♡DS: Well they are. It’s just things have changed.

♡❤♡DS: Who are you talking about?

♡❤♡DS: Yeah.

♡❤♡DS: It’s confusing because you look at somebody like &lt;a href="Dick%20Cheney"&gt;Dick Cheney&lt;/a&gt;, who has this &lt;a href="lesbian"&gt;lesbian&lt;/a&gt; daughter, who’s in a &lt;a href="gay%20marriage"&gt;gay marriage&lt;/a&gt; [♡❤Poe and Cheney have not entered into a formal union♡❤ - ♡❤ed♡❤] and now has a baby with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHeather%20Poe"&gt;her partner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and you just don’t know how the situation exists. It’s hard to comprehend. That &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMary%20Cheney"&gt;Mary Cheney&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; exists in the Republican party, and that she seems to be fine with that existence and even works for it. 

<h2>Billy West on modern American society</h2>
♡❤♡DS: Has the &lt;a href="Iraq%20War"&gt;Iraq War&lt;/a&gt; affected you much as a person?

♡❤♡DS: Teach the controversy. Make it appear there are two sides to every fact.

♡❤♡DS: Do you think we live in a fear-based society now?

♡❤♡DS: What is the reasoning behind questions like, 'Aren’t you afraid of saying such-and-such thing?'

♡❤♡DS: Are you optimistic?

♡❤♡DS: And you think that they are equal?

♡❤♡DS: You’re saying in today’s culture they are equal?

♡❤♡DS: I don’t have cable, so I know how you feel.

♡❤♡DS: It’s amazing when you hear the BBC interview British politicians. We find it shocking that they’ll say things like “Aren’t you essentially lying when you say that?”

♡❤♡DS: That's an argument on &lt;a href="Wikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;: people make the argument, 'let's present the information out there and ♡❤let the reader decide.♡❤
♡❤♡DS: Exactly,and it can be difficult to decide what to believe when reasonable minds can differ, but I think it's very problematic to ever argue "just let the reader decide." I don't know if Wikipedia is the place for that fight, but in the news media, that is the place for the fight. I interviewed Gay Talese, who quoted Norman Mailer who said the media is like a donkey, and you must feed the donkey every day; the donkey will eat anything: garbage, tin cans, slop. And report on whatever they are fed.

<h2>Billy West on telling it like it is</h2>
♡❤♡DS: Are your voices an attempt to understand reality?

♡❤♡DS: No you are. 

♡❤♡DS: Well it’s good.

♡❤♡DS: That's perfect. I will send you a link to the interview when it is published.

♡❤♡DS: It doesn’t say anything negative about the Stern show. It just mentions the characters that you did and that you were on there. And the only thing it says is that “Billy has since claimed that he left the Stern show because WXRK management refused to give him a sufficient pay raise.”

♡❤♡DS: There’s a link to your official web site on there. And there’s also a link to Voicechasers database and a link to Internet Movie database and a link to an interview with you on CNBC.

&lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;, president of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; met with the &lt;a href="Mali"&gt;Mali&lt;/a&gt;an &lt;a href="w%3AAmadou%20Toumani%20Tour%C3%A9"&gt;President Amadou Touré&lt;/a&gt; yesterday. Mr.Bush said that he "was touched by the [Malian] President's concern about the life of the average citizen in Mali," and that he is "proud to be standing side-by-side with you [Amadou Touré]." 
Mr.Bush started the press conference after the meeting by saying that one of the reasons he wants to work with Mali is "because they've agreed to fight corruption, and support the education and health of its citizens." He added that he believes Mali is "a country that's committed to the rights of its people," and that the United States is "proud to be standing side-by-side with you. [the Malian President]." Mr.Bush also thanked Touré "for his hard work in helping his citizens deal with HIV/AIDS."

Mr.Bush said that in the meeting they spent "a fair amount of time talking about the dangers of radicals and extremists associated with groups like &lt;a href="w%3Aal%20Qaeda"&gt;al Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;." He said that they also discussed the "need for close cooperation to protect the innocent people from those who murder the innocent in order to achieve their dark political vision."

Mr. Touré said in the press conference after the meeting that he "would like to convey to the President of the United States the sympathies and solidarity of the people of Mali because of the destruction caused by the tornados in some of the southern states of the United States." He continued by saying that "the [US] President had some initiatives not only for Mali, but also for &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;, which we [the Malian government] believe are historical initiatives."

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=2008%20Taipei%20International%20Book%20Exhibition%3A%20Opening%20day%20highlights&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Even though the weather was cold &amp; bad weather in &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei"&gt;Taipei&lt;/a&gt; the 2008 Taipei International Book Exhibition (TIBE 2008), anticipated by worldwide media, government executives, and publishing experts, started on February 13 at the &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20World%20Trade%20Center"&gt;Taipei World Trade Center&lt;/a&gt; Halls 1 to 3. The show organizer, the Taipei Book Fair Foundation (TBFF), presented a special book award named the "Taipei International Book Exhibition Prize" (TIBE Prize) to publishers and authors for the first time.
<h2>Comic fans crowded, cosplayers became a focus at Comic Hall</h2>
The &lt;a href="w%3AComic"&gt;Comic&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href="w%3AAnime"&gt;Anime&lt;/a&gt; Hall, located at the Taipei Show (Hall 2), held the first opening reception party with many cosplayers from "Romantic Versailles Star", spokespeople of its pavilion (Eddie Yu-yen Peng and Janine Chun-ning Chang), and several experts from the comic and anime industry like Rex How &amp; &lt;a href="w%3ARiyoko%20Ikeda"&gt;Riyoko Ikeda&lt;/a&gt;.

Two days ago many participants were still stocking goods for the main show, and the organizer (TBFF) set several warning and control lines to welcome comic and anime fans to the main show. As a result, fans and readers filled the booths in the opening hours. The comic pavilion suddenly became a hot center-stage in this exhibition.
<h2>First-ever Taipei international Book Exhibition Prize</h2>
This year the TBFF decided to award the "TIBE Prize" based off their experiences at the &lt;a href="w%3AFrankfurt%20Book%20Fair"&gt;Frankfurt Book Fair&lt;/a&gt;. The goal of the award was to choose the best books and promote them in the global publishing market.

According to the TBFF, this award is very important because it will be a kernel of the show. If a book wins this award it will win the rare opportunity of gaining visibility in a worldwide market.

<h2>Executives, officials, spokespeople, and readers gather over TWTC</h2>
The spokespeople in the Hall 2 and the TBFF also invited &lt;a href="w%3AAshin"&gt;Ashin&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3AMayday%20%28Taiwanese%20band%29"&gt;Mayday&lt;/a&gt; to become the spokesman of TIBE 2008. As many publishing executives worldwide, government officials in Taiwan, entertainers, and spokespeople from &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; gather for this show, the publishing industry will have a bright future with more international exchanges and trade opportunities.

<h1>'Top Model' winner Jaslene Gonzalez on her career and being a Latina role model</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=%27Top%20Model%27%20winner%20Jaslene%20Gonzalez%20on%20her%20career%20and%20being%20a%20Latina%20role%20model&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3AJaslene%20Gonzalez"&gt;Jaslene Gonzalez&lt;/a&gt; is not your typical model. She rose to fame after winning &lt;a href="w%3AAmerica%27s%20Next%20Top%20Model%2C%20Cycle%208"&gt;Cycle 8&lt;/a&gt; of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAmerica%27s%20Next%20Top%20Model"&gt;America's Next Top Model&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, and since then, has been aggressively tapping into the fashion industry. As a result of her Latin background, Gonzalez has been successful at marketing herself both in the English-speaking and Spanish-speaking worlds. However, Gonzalez is much much more – a fighter, a humanitarian, and a good Latin granddaughter. 

Born in Chicago to a Latina mother, and a Puerto Rican-born father, Gonzalez had, in many ways, a typical U.S. Latino experience – her tight knit family, grandparents, and spirituality played an intrinsic part in her upbringing. 

"I went to an all-girl Catholic school and grew up with tons of family...My family was very close knit and supportive. They were involved in my life everyday. So there was so much joy in every little occasion...Every Sunday we would go to my grandmother's house where we [the family] would hang out together...We enjoyed being around each other and being together," states Gonzalez. 

Her grandfather was the director of a local dance group, Viva La Gente, which Gonzalez credits with impacting her life positively. 

"I was a dancer for 12 years and life revolved around dancing. I was a very active girl, and was always involved with my grandfather's dance studio. The whole family was. My aunts, my cousins – everyone took part in performances and were involved in the group...That's how we spent our summers, and we looked forward to being outside, dancing salsa, hip hop, merengue," states Gonzalez. Through her involvement in the dance studio, Gonzalez's horizon was broadened significantly, and her humanitarian streak began to deepen. 

"We were always constantly traveling. We traveled to Mexico to poor villages where we gave performances to give back to the community," said Gonzalez. 

Ironically, ANTM gave her the opportunity to overcome her own difficulties and to further help those in need. "I went in there, without knowing that I was in an abusive relationship. They were the ones that brought that up to me...they felt I was emotionally destroyed, they wanted me to get support," commented Gonzalez. While the ANTM staff was supportive, she also credits her life long dream for helping her get out of the abusive relationship. 

"Having a dream and having a goal in life, is the most important thing I did in my life. Because of that I maneuvered my way to that dream. I knew I was better than that, I wanted to be happier,” stated Gonzalez. 

Soon after winning ANTM, Gonzalez became a spokesperson for Liz Claiborne and the National Domestic Violence Hotline, and began traveling the country reaching out to women. 

"We had several meetings, and they asked me to be a spokesperson. I was so happy and blessed to help women, to have that title. It's something I want to do, besides modelling...I enjoy sharing my personal experiences because I can educate them, but I can also save someone's life. It's something precious, it's a gift," stated Gonzalez. 

Abuse is not the only obstacle Jaslene has had to face. Growing up Latina had its own set of difficulties. "Being a minority is a challenge no matter what," states Gonzalez. 

However, Gonzalez also states that being a Latina has many positive aspects in regards to her profession. "As a Latina, you have the advantage of being a Latina. Not only do you have this corporate job, but you can relate to many groups as a person."

When asked if the fashion industry forces Latina models to change certain aspects about themselves, she remarks that she focuses on always staying true to herself. "Modeling is a difficult job because of what you go through. 80% of the time it's a no...When I go in, I go in like me, I don't have to change anything. Any time I get a chance to show who I am, I do. I am a Spanish girl, trying to pursue my dreams. I try to be the best I can be," remarked Gonzalez. 

It is that same confidence and will to succeed that she seems to appreciate in other woman. "I find women beautiful. I find a girl with no makeup, not worrying about her style and appearance, I find that sexy. I find confidence beautiful...Its so simple. It's being natural and confident," said Gonzalez. 

As a role model, she has two key pieces advice that she offers women: nurture your mind with positive thoughts, and identify and foster the principles in life you value. 

It is not surprising to see why Gonzalez's family is proud of her. "My family is so funny. They are so happy. I've never seen them so full of life. My mom acts like she won. My grandmother screams '&lt;a href="wikt%3Aflaca"&gt;mi flaca&lt;/a&gt;' every time she sees me. They are so proud. Especially my grandparents. I was practically raised by them. To see them see you so happy and successful, there couldn't be a better feeling," said Gonzalez. 

She adds that her grandparents would be extremely happy if she appeared on ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACristina%20Saralegui"&gt;Cristina&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, the Spanish-language talk show whose host is referred to as "the Spanish Oprah Winfrey."

<h1>Writers Guild of America ends strike</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Writers%20Guild%20of%20America%20ends%20strike&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Hollywood writers have voted to end a three-month strike that crippled film and television production. 

Yesterday, &lt;a href="w%3APatric%20Verrone"&gt;Patric Verrone&lt;/a&gt;, president of the &lt;a href="w%3AWriters%20Guild%20of%20America%20West"&gt;Writers Guild of America West&lt;/a&gt;, said they will end the 100-day strike. "The membership has voted. Writers can go back to work," Verrone said.

Nearly 3800 members of the guild, both the east and west coast unions cast their ballots in &lt;a href="New%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Los%20Angeles"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, with more than 92 percent voting to end the strike. The writers will be back to work today and new episodes of televisions series should come as early as four to six weeks.

The strike occurred over the streaming of television, movies and other creative work over the Internet and how writers should be paid for that content. Under a tentative agreement, the writers would get a maximum flat fee of $1,200 per program in the first two years, then two percent of a distributor's gross revenue in the third year.

The strike ended after entertainment company heads including, &lt;a href="w%3ALeslie%20Moonves"&gt;Leslie Moonves&lt;/a&gt;, the CEO of &lt;a href="w%3ACBS"&gt;CBS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Chernin"&gt;Peter Chernin&lt;/a&gt;, the president of &lt;a href="w%3ANews%20Corporation"&gt;News Corporation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20A.%20Iger"&gt;Robert A. Iger&lt;/a&gt;, the CEO of &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Walt%20Disney%20Company"&gt;The Walt Disney Company&lt;/a&gt; and union officials such as Verrone and executive director David Young worked out a deal.

Moonves said the deal was a fair one, according to the Associated Press. When speaking to the entertainment publication Variety, he said, "I think there was some miscommunication early on. It was important that we started speaking eye to eye. Ultimately, getting the percentage of streaming revenue was important to (WGA), and I understand it."

The end to the strike means Hollywood's annual celebration, the &lt;a href="w%3AAcademy%20Awards"&gt;Academy Awards&lt;/a&gt;, can go ahead as scheduled, February 24. The threat of picketing writers had reduced the Golden Globes last month to a news conference. &lt;a href="w%3ASid%20Ganis"&gt;Sid Ganis&lt;/a&gt;, the president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and the executive producer of this year's &lt;a href="w%3A80th%20Academy%20Awards"&gt;80th Academy Awards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGil%20Cates"&gt;Gil Cates&lt;/a&gt;, will hold a news conference today to reveal their plans for the award show since there will not a be picket line in front of the Kodak Theatre where the award show will be held.

The strike stopped production of dozens of television shows and slowed production on movies. One Los Angeles economist says it cost the local economy at least $3 billion. However, the city of Los Angeles believed losses to only be around $380 million.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Rhine-Westphalia"&gt;North Rhine-Westphalia&lt;/a&gt; Higher Administrative Court in &lt;a href="w%3AM%C3%BCnster"&gt;Münster&lt;/a&gt; ruled that there is enough information present to continue to allow Germany's intelligence agencies to monitor &lt;a href="w%3AScientology"&gt;Scientology&lt;/a&gt; activities, asserting that the organization and its members have ambitions contrary to Germany's democratic order. The agency which monitors Scientology in Germany is called the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, and has had the Church of Scientology under surveillance in Germany since 1997. 
The ruling stated: "There are concrete indications that Scientology's activities are to implement Scientology's program in Germany and to expand more and more Scientology's principles in government, economy and society". The court did not rule on whether or not the organization should be considered a religion, saying that was irrelevant to the ruling. The German government considers Scientology a business, and not a religion. 

The court cited "numerous indications" that "central constitutional values such as the dignity of mankind and the right to equal treatment would be suspended or restricted," in a Scientology society. The statement released along with the court's decision also said that "In particular, there is the suspicion that in a scientological society only Scientologists would enjoy civil rights". 

During the court proceedings the German court heard testimony concerning anti-democratic statements made by &lt;a href="w%3AL.%20Ron%20Hubbard"&gt;L. Ron Hubbard&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; founder of Scientology who died in 1986. The court did not find any evidence that the organization had distanced itself from Hubbard's statements. Certain statements made by Hubbard detail how to harass ex-members and critics of Scientology. Scientologists presented other writings by Hubbard, and asserted that he was a peaceful person and was being quoted out of context. 

Other evidence considered by the court included "&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Way%20to%20Happiness"&gt;The Way to Happiness&lt;/a&gt;" brochures, part of the organization's campaign to disseminate Scientology principles worldwide. The project is called "Operation Planetary Calm". A brochure was sent to the office of German Interior Minister &lt;a href="w%3AWolfgang%20Sch%C3%A4uble"&gt;Wolfgang Schäuble&lt;/a&gt;, whose office monitors Scientology and other groups deemed a threat to Germany's constitution.

When the Church of Scientology opened new headquarters in &lt;a href="w%3ABerlin"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt; in January, opponents of Scientology protested outside the building and accused the organization of brainwashing its members. In December, Germany's top security officials stated that they believe Scientology is in violation of the German constitution, and requested state officials to investigate whether they have sufficient information to ban the organization in Germany.
Scientology spokeswoman Sabine Weber said that the organization will appeal the ruling. Karin Pouw, public affairs director for the Church of Scientology International told the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;♡❤: "Despite over 10 years of intrusive investigation and harassment of Scientologists, not one shred of evidence has been uncovered to justify this politically motivated investigation". A statement released by the Church of Scientology in Germany said: "The German Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution should finally end this farce and turn its attention to real enemies of the Constitution and real danger so as to do what it is there for: to protect the German constitution and the basic rights of the people". 

The Church of Scientology took German authorities to court in March 2003, seeking to stop further surveillance of their organization. In a November 2004 ruling, a court in &lt;a href="w%3ACologne"&gt;Cologne&lt;/a&gt; upheld the legality of the German government's surveillance of the Church of Scientology.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20State"&gt;United States Department of State&lt;/a&gt; has criticized Germany for its surveillance of Scientology in its annual Human Rights Report.

♡❤Wikinews♡❤ held an exclusive interview with &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Jackson"&gt;Bob Jackson&lt;/a&gt;, one of the candidates for the &lt;a href="w%3ALibertarian%20Party"&gt;Libertarian Party&lt;/a&gt; nomination for the &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20U.S.%20presidential%20election"&gt;2008 U.S. presidential election&lt;/a&gt;.

Jackson, an engineer, believes that he can win the Libertarian nomination and, though it is unlikely, the White House as well.

He believes that the strength of America is based on the maximum freedom of citizens who are responsible for their actions. "This", he says, "is guaranteed by the Constitution and made possible by the rule of law and limited government."

He has plans for Iraq and the economy, as well as "correcting a dysfunctional government, a real energy policy and a better national defense."

Two astronauts have performed a spacewalk, or EVA, to replace a depleted &lt;a href="w%3Anitrogen"&gt;nitrogen&lt;/a&gt; tank in the &lt;a href="w%3AIntegrated%20Truss%20Structure"&gt;Integrated Truss Structure&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Space%20Station"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt;. The Space Station's Nitrogen Tank Assembly (NTA), was successfully replaced with a new one, launched aboard &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle"&gt;Space Shuttle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Atlantis"&gt;♡❤Atlantis♡❤&lt;/a&gt;, which is currently visiting the station, on mission &lt;a href="w%3ASTS-122"&gt;STS-122&lt;/a&gt;. The old tank will be returned to Earth aboard the Shuttle. The NTA forms part of the Space Station's cooling system.

The spacewalk was successful, and the primary task of changing the tank was completed ahead of schedule, allowing the astronauts to perform several secondary tasks, which included the installation of thermal covers on the newly installed ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AColumbus%20module"&gt;Columbus&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ module, and inspection of &lt;a href="w%3Amicrometeoroid"&gt;micrometeoroid&lt;/a&gt; shields on the &lt;a href="w%3ADestiny%20module"&gt;♡❤Destiny♡❤&lt;/a&gt; module.

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; astronaut &lt;a href="w%3ARex%20Walheim"&gt;Rex Walheim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; astronaut &lt;a href="w%3AHans%20Schlegel"&gt;Hans Schlegel&lt;/a&gt;, both of the STS-122 crew, left the ISS ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AQuest%20%28ISS%20module%29"&gt;Quest&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ airlock at 14:27 GMT, and re-entered it at 21:12, after six hours and 45 minutes of extra-vehicular activity. This is the 103 spacewalk to be made as part of the International Space Station programme, and the second of three planned for the STS-122 mission.

Meanwhile, NASA have announced that the STS-122 mission has been extended by one day. Landing is now scheduled for next Wednesday, at 13:59 GMT. The extension will give the astronauts extra time to finish activating the ♡❤Columbus♡❤ module, a process which has been delayed due to computer problems aboard the module.

There were 6 games played in the National Hockey League on February 13, 2008.

<h2>Game summaries</h2>

<h3>Ottawa Senators @ New Jersey Devils</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3ALuke%20Richardson"&gt;Luke Richardson&lt;/a&gt; put the Senators on the board early in the first period. &lt;a href="w%3AJamie%20Langenbrunner"&gt;Jamie Langenbrunner&lt;/a&gt; picked up a short-handed goal, assisted by &lt;a href="w%3APatrik%20Elias"&gt;Patrik Elias&lt;/a&gt; to tie it up 6:12 into the 2nd period. The Devils went ahead less than two minutes later on a &lt;a href="w%3AKarel%20Rachunek"&gt;Karel Rachunek&lt;/a&gt; goal which Elias also assisted in. The Senators would tie it up again later in the 2nd period with &lt;a href="w%3ARandy%20Robitaille"&gt;Randy Robitaille&lt;/a&gt; beating New Jersey's &lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20Brodeur"&gt;Martin Brodeur&lt;/a&gt; at 15:29. After a scoreless 3rd, the game went to overtime, where &lt;a href="w%3ABrian%20Gionta"&gt;Brian Gionta&lt;/a&gt; scored his first goal in 13 games off a rebound from Langenbrunner.

<h3>Washington Capitals @ Atlanta Thrashers</h3>

After a scoreless 1st period, &lt;a href="w%3AViktor%20Kozlov"&gt;Viktor Kozlov&lt;/a&gt; scored on an &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Ovechkin"&gt;Alexander Ovechkin&lt;/a&gt; feed to put the Caps up early. &lt;a href="w%3AEric%20Perrin"&gt;Eric Perrin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMarian%20Hossa"&gt;Marian Hossa&lt;/a&gt; then gave the Thrashers the lead with goals 2:34 apart late in the 2nd. Then Ovechkin scored his 48th goal of the season with just 1:21 left in the 3rd to send it into overtime. In the shootout, Perrin and &lt;a href="w%3ASlava%20Kozlov"&gt;Slava Kozlov&lt;/a&gt; each scored against Caps goaltender &lt;a href="w%3AOlaf%20Kolzig"&gt;Olaf Kolzig&lt;/a&gt;. Thrashers goalie &lt;a href="w%3AKari%20Lehtonen"&gt;Kari Lehtonen&lt;/a&gt; stopped both &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Semin"&gt;Alexander Semin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABoyd%20Gordon"&gt;Boyd Gordon&lt;/a&gt;'s attempts to pick up the win.
<h3>Chicago Blackhawks @ Columbus Blue Jackets</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Kane"&gt;Patrick Kane&lt;/a&gt; scored his first goal since January 18 when he scored on Chicago's first power play. &lt;a href="w%3ABrent%20Seabrook"&gt;Brent Seabrook&lt;/a&gt; added one for the Hawks less than 1:30 later. &lt;a href="w%3ADustin%20Byfuglien"&gt;Dustin Byfuglien&lt;/a&gt; scored twice for the Hawks in the 1st to give Chicago a 4 goal lead after 1 period of play. &lt;a href="w%3ADick%20Tarnstrom"&gt;Dick Tarnstrom&lt;/a&gt; put the Jackets on the board early in the 2nd with a power play goal, but Chicago would answer back with a &lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20Havlat"&gt;Martin Havlat&lt;/a&gt; goal to increase their lead back to 4. &lt;a href="w%3AFredrik%20Modin"&gt;Fredrik Modin&lt;/a&gt; would score at 13:06 in the 2nd on another Columbus power-play to again cut the deficit, but &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Wisniewski"&gt;James Wisniewski&lt;/a&gt; would put Chicago ahead by 4 once again just 2:17 later. &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Lang"&gt;Robert Lang&lt;/a&gt; would cap it off with an unassisted goal with less than a minute left in the game.
<h3>Toronto Maple Leafs @ Buffalo Sabres</h3>

In a real goaltender's duel, the Buffalo Sabers, who have seemed to catch a second wind after a 3-7-5 stretch leading into the all-star break, have rallied behind their star goaltender &lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Miller%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;Ryan Miller&lt;/a&gt;, who stopped 35 shots and picked up the shutout. The game's only goal was scored by &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Gaustad"&gt;Paul Gaustad&lt;/a&gt; at 8:56 in the 3rd period.
<h3>Boston Bruins @ Pittsburgh Penguins</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3APetteri%20Nokelainen"&gt;Petteri Nokelainen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AVladimir%20Sobotka"&gt;Vladimir Sobotka&lt;/a&gt; scored back-to-back goals in the first period to put the B's ahead by 2 early in the game. &lt;a href="w%3ATim%20Thomas%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;Tim Thomas&lt;/a&gt; didn't have to stop very many shots in the second period; only one shot actually went on goal through a 15 minute stretch. One goal did get by him in the 3rd, scored by &lt;a href="w%3AEvgeni%20Malkin"&gt;Evgeni Malkin&lt;/a&gt; on a Penguins power-play. Malkin has stepped up to fill the hole left by the injured &lt;a href="w%3ASidney%20Crosby"&gt;Sidney Crosby&lt;/a&gt;, scoring 16 points in the last 6 games.
<h3>Montreal Canadiens @ Florida Panthers</h3>

Teammate &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Zednik"&gt;Richard Zednik&lt;/a&gt; was on the minds of the Florida Panthers players in their first game since Zednik was cut in the neck by &lt;a href="w%3AOlli%20Jokinen"&gt;Olli Jokinen&lt;/a&gt;'s skate in Buffalo on Sunday. &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Montador"&gt;Steve Montador&lt;/a&gt; scored the first goal at 12:04 in the first period on a Florida power-play. &lt;a href="w%3AChristopher%20Higgins"&gt;Christopher Higgins&lt;/a&gt; would tie the game in the 3rd period on a pass from &lt;a href="w%3ASako%20Koivu"&gt;Sako Koivu&lt;/a&gt; to send the game into overtime, where &lt;a href="w%3AAlexei%20Kovalev"&gt;Alexei Kovalev&lt;/a&gt; scored the game winner at 1:43 to give Montreal the win.
<h2>Other news</h2>

Bruins defenseman &lt;a href="w%3AAaron%20Ward%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;Aaron Ward&lt;/a&gt; was taken to a hospital with a neck injury after being hit with a high stick early in the second period. Coach Claude Julien said that Ward had coughed up blood.

&lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Zednik"&gt;Richard Zednik&lt;/a&gt; is expected to be released from a Buffalo hospital in 24-48 hours, though he may not return to the ice before the end of the season.

<h1>International row after Spielberg quits 2008 Beijing Olympics</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=International%20row%20after%20Spielberg%20quits%202008%20Beijing%20Olympics&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
On Wednesday, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; film director &lt;a href="Steven%20Spielberg"&gt;Steven Spielberg&lt;/a&gt; withdrew from his position as artistic adviser to the &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20Summer%20Olympics"&gt;2008 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Beijing"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;. "Conscience will not allow me to continue with business as usual," he said.

"Sudan's government bears the bulk of the responsibility for these ongoing crimes but the international community, and particularly China, should be doing more to end the continuing human suffering there," Spielberg's statement said. "China's economic, military and diplomatic ties to the government of Sudan continue to provide it with the opportunity and obligation to press for change."

China immediately expressed regret over his decision and suggested that "ulterior motives" may be at play. "It is understandable if some people do not understand the Chinese government policy on Darfur, but I am afraid that some people may have ulterior motives, and this we cannot accept. ... China is also concerned about the humanitarian situation in Darfur. [But] empty rhetoric will not help. We hope that relevant people will be more pragmatic," said &lt;a href="w%3ALiu%20Jianchao"&gt;Liu Jianchao&lt;/a&gt;, the Deputy-Director General of the Information Department in &lt;a href="w%3AMinistry%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%20of%20the%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;China's foreign ministry&lt;/a&gt;.

Following Spielberg's withdrawal, other organizations called for boycott of the Games. However, &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMinister%20for%20the%20Olympics"&gt;Minister for the Olympics&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATessa%20Jowell"&gt;Tessa Jowell&lt;/a&gt; rejected such calls. "The world has known for the last seven years that Beijing would host the Olympics," Jowell told ♡❤The Times♡❤. "Most progressive governments accept that there are wholly unacceptable aspects of Chinese policy, but that did not stop the International Olympic Committee awarding them the games. A call for a boycott doesn't serve any purpose and it would be a great pity. This doesn't mean, however, we should be distracted from the urgency of Darfur."

"China is also concerned about the humanitarian issues there, but we have been playing a positive and constructive role in promoting peace in Darfur," Liu said, adding that China is working with the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; to provide aid and resolve the crisis.

Critics of China contend that China supports the &lt;a href="Islam"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;ic regime in &lt;a href="Sudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt; because it buys two-thirds of the country's oil exports and also sells it weapons. Further, China has been defending the government in &lt;a href="w%3AKhartoum"&gt;Khartoum&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Security%20Council"&gt;United Nations Security Council&lt;/a&gt;. Since 2003, fighting between government-backed militia and rebels in &lt;a href="Darfur"&gt;Darfur&lt;/a&gt; has led to the death of more than 200,000 people and displaced some 2.5 million others.

Meanwhile, United States President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; confirmed that he still plans to attend the Games in Beijing. "I view the Olympics as a sporting event. On the other hand, I have a different platform to Steven Spielberg, so I get to talk to &lt;a href="Hu%20Jintao"&gt;Hu Jintao&lt;/a&gt; [President of China] and I do remind him he can do more to relieve the suffering in Darfur."

Bush followed this by saying: "I’m not going to use the Olympics as an opportunity to express my opinions to the Chinese people in a public way because I do it all the time with the president."

Following the first day's events at the &lt;a href="2008%20Taipei%20International%20Book%20Exhibition"&gt;2008 Taipei International Book Exhibition&lt;/a&gt; (TIBE), organisers used today as an opportunity for a number of &lt;a href="w%3Aautograph"&gt;autograph sessions&lt;/a&gt;, the announcement of awards and a focus on the &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20World%20Trade%20Center"&gt;Taipei World Trade Center&lt;/a&gt;'s Hall 3 where children's activities and seminars were being held.

The Kids' Book Hall, which was created with cooperation from the Regional Association of Educational Materials, saw a new addition this year in the form of the "Taiwan Stationery" pavilion. The display included a variety of paper products not only for children, but for small-business and general usage. 

In order to promote some conceptions on environment and recycling, Yuen Foong Yu Paper Mfg. Co. Ltd. sponsored the exhibition with recycled poster container and corrugated-fiberboard, which was used to design several nature scenes, and the material will be reusable in the future.

Participants also held several seminars at TWTC Hall 1 for reading population promotion, for example, a Taiwanese version of a famous magazine named ♡❤"Kagakuru"♡❤. Aimed at science education, imported by Taiwan Mac Education, and promoted by several academic professionals in Taiwan, the magazine will be released on March 3, 2008.

A recently released report written by people from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Veterinary%20college"&gt;Royal Veterinary college&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Warwick"&gt;University of Warwick&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Bristol"&gt;University of Bristol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has found that 27.6% of chickens reared for human consumption struggle to walk, although a "considerable variation in walking ability between flocks," was reported. The study reported that "27.6 per cent of birds represented by this survey had a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGait%20Abnormality%20Rating%20Scale"&gt;gait score&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of three or above."

The study also stated that the month in which broiler chickens were least likely to have severely damaged legs was March, with it being most likely in the month of September. The study also said that the chickens which were tightly packed into a small area were more likely to have difficulties walking than chickens that were given more space.

The report finished by saying that "consumers currently know little about how broiler chickens are reared but can be shocked when presented with information about current commercial practices," and that "Since the sustainability of intensive broiler production depends on continued consumer acceptance of the farming practices involved, the broiler industry will need to work with the scientific community to develop more robust and healthier genotypes and to ensure that optimal husbandry and management practices are fully implemented."

Inflation in &lt;a href="Finland"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt; hit a 7-year-high in January, reaching 3.8%, it has emerged.

The agency said that economic policy was responsible, with researcher Juhani Pekkarinen saying "About a sixth of the (year-on-year) increase was caused by taxes," and going on to add that the low prices of vehicles and electronics had prevented inflation from rising further. Statistics Finland added that contributing factors included increases in food, alcohol and liquid fuel prices, higher interest rates and an increase to costs in restaurants and cafés.

Erkki Liikanen, governor at the &lt;a href="w%3ABank%20of%20Finland"&gt;Bank of Finland&lt;/a&gt;, also commented on the new figures. "It is a high figure and shows how important it is to strive for price stability... One of the basic functions of the central bank is secure price stability ... which, in turn, is necessary for improving growth and employment."

He went on to say the bank would monitor the situation across &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;, saying "We will be evaluating the risks facing economies from the angle of price stability and growth, and then when we next meet in March we'll see (if a response is required)."

Former &lt;a href="Rhode%20Island"&gt;Rhode Island&lt;/a&gt; Senator &lt;a href="w%3ALincoln%20Chafee"&gt;Lincoln Chafee&lt;/a&gt;, a lifelong &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Republican%20Party"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; who left the party in 2007 following a defeat in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate%20election%20in%20Rhode%20Island%2C%202006"&gt;2006 midterm elections&lt;/a&gt;, endorsed &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Democratic&lt;/a&gt; Senator &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; in his bid for the White House. Chafee said Obama is the "best candidate to restore American credibility, to restore our confidence to be moral and to bring people together to solve the complex issues". 

Chafee was considered a &lt;a href="w%3ALiberalism%20in%20the%20United%20States"&gt;liberal Republican&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; disagreeing with his party on issues such as the &lt;a href="w%3AWar%20in%20Iraq"&gt;War in Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, abortion, gay rights, global warming and taxes. During the 2006 Congressional elections, he was endorsed by &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; despite differences on issues, and current Republican front-runner &lt;a href="John%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt; even campaigned for Chafee. The Rhode Islander said he thinks McCain would "understand" his current endorsement. Chafee lost the 2006 election to Democrat &lt;a href="w%3ASheldon%20Whitehouse"&gt;Sheldon Whitehouse&lt;/a&gt;, who has endorsed Senator &lt;a href="Hillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt; for the presidency. 

For Obama, the endorsement marks the second former Republican Party member of Congress to support his campaign. In January, &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20B.%20Anderson"&gt;John B. Anderson&lt;/a&gt;, a 1980 presidential candidate and former Illinois Representative, endorsed Obama.

Six people were killed and 16 others injured in a shooting at the &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Illinois%20University"&gt;Northern Illinois University&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ADeKalb%2C%20Illinois"&gt;DeKalb&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Illinois"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. 

Reports indicate that the shooter emerged from a curtain or a screen at the front of an auditorium in Cole Hall armed with a shotgun and two pistols and began shooting.

Authorities have tentatively identified the shooter as &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Kazmierczak"&gt;Stephen Kazmierczak&lt;/a&gt;. NIU officials said the shooter was enrolled at the university as late as the spring semester of 2007, and was now a student at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign.

Many of the victims were taken to local hospitals. Kishwaukee Community Hospital reported a total of 18 patients brought to the hospital. Of the 18, only two were admitted. Eight of the patients were discharged later in the day, while seven were transferred to other regional hospitals for treatment. One victim died at Kishwaukee Hospital, another died after being transferred to St. Anthony's Hospital in Rockford, while the other four fatalities were confirmed at the scene.

News about the shooting emerged at 3:20 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Standard%20Time"&gt;CST&lt;/a&gt;, when a special campus notice was posted on the university's website, indicating the presence of a gunman on campus. Twenty minutes later, NIU announced the cancellation of all classes for the remainder of the evening, and ten minutes after that announcement, NIU officials confirmed there had been a shooting and that emergency personnel were handling the situation.

"The ambulance took away two students on the ground right outside my dorm," Dominique Broxton, a student at NIU, told the ♡❤Chicago Tribune♡❤. "I don't know them. They looked bloody. Where I am right now, there are a lot of police, at least a dozen. There are police cars and trucks everywhere." George Gaynor, a student in the lecture hall when the shooting occurred, added that the shooter looked like "a skinny white guy with a stocking cap on."

The DeKalb County coroner has released the names of all those killed in the attack. In addition to the shooter, those killed included Daniel Parmenter, 20; Catalina Garcia, 20; Ryanne Mace, 19; Julianna Gehant, 32, and Gayle Dubowski, 20. All were students at NIU. Chicago news outlets are also reporting names of four of the surviving victims:

<ul>
BULLET::::- Joseph Peterson, a graduate assistant and instructor of the course in session at the time of the shooting.
BULLET::::- Patrick Korellias, a student in the class at the time of the shooting.
BULLET::::- J.D. Donohue', a student in the class at the time of the shooting.
BULLET::::- Ah-Num Rahman, a student in the class at the time of the shooting.

</ul>
Rahman was transferred to Good Samaritan Hospital in &lt;a href="w%3ADowners%20Grove%2C%20Illinois"&gt;Downers Grove&lt;/a&gt; with shotgun wounds to both arms and the side of her face. The other three remain at Kishwaukee Community Hospital.

NIU president John Peters released some details about the shooter during a press conference following the shooting. Kazmierczak had been a student at NIU but transferred to the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Illinois%20at%20Urbana-Champaign"&gt;University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign&lt;/a&gt; for the current academic year. He was pursuing a graduate degree in sociology, with an emphasis in peace and social justice. Kazmierczak won a Dean's Award for a project in 2006, and was active in the student government while at NIU. Officials at a press conference also indicated that Kazmierczak was taking medication for an unspecified condition, and discontinued use of that medication approximately two weeks prior to the shooting.

The campus of Northern Illinois University is closed until further notice, and officials have announced the cancellation of all athletic events, home and away, through at least Sunday, February 17.

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; military has announced their intention to use a missile to destroy &lt;a href="w%3AUSA%20193"&gt;USA-193&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3Aspy%20satellite"&gt;spy satellite&lt;/a&gt; which failed immediately after launch in December &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20in%20spaceflight"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;. Since launch, the satellite's orbit has decayed and it is approaching the point at which it will re-enter the atmosphere and potentially fall to Earth. The missile will be used as a kinetic &lt;a href="w%3Aanti-satellite%20weapon"&gt;anti-satellite weapon&lt;/a&gt; (ASAT), and will destroy the satellite through hitting it at high speed.

The satellite potentially has hazardous materials on board, including &lt;a href="w%3Ahydrazine"&gt;hydrazine&lt;/a&gt;. Ordinarily, the hydrazine would be used as fuel, but since the satellite failed immediately after launch, this was never used. It is expected that about half of the satellite would be capable of surviving &lt;a href="w%3AAtmospheric%20re-entry"&gt;re-entry&lt;/a&gt;, potentially including the fuel tank. Since hydrazine is toxic, the satellite could pose a severe danger if it hits in a populated area, however it has been considered likely that the tank would probably rupture and explode during re-entry. Destroying the satellite on the grounds of safety is the stated purpose of shooting down the satellite. Officials have denied claims that it is to prevent secrets that the satellite is carrying from falling into the wrong hands, or that it is a demonstration in response to a Chinese ASAT test in January &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20in%20spaceflight"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;.

The missile which will be used to shoot down the satellite will be a &lt;a href="w%3AStandard%20Missile"&gt;Standard Missile 3&lt;/a&gt; (SM-3), which will be launched from the &lt;a href="w%3AUSS%20Lake%20Erie"&gt;USS Lake Erie&lt;/a&gt; in the North Pacific Ocean. The missile, which was designed to shoot down other missiles, will be modified slightly in order to allow it to recognise USA-193 as its target. 

If the attack is successful, the satellite will be broken into many small pieces. This will eliminate the hazard from the hydrazine and break into small enough pieces that nothing will survive reentry. Officials reported that the likelihood of success was "high". &lt;a href="NASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; Administrator &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20D.%20Griffin"&gt;Michael Griffin&lt;/a&gt; said that it was impossible to make the situation any worse. Missing the satellite would change nothing, while a slight blow would still result in the satellite returning to Earth, and a direct hit would destroy the satellite. It is believed that the missile will be aimed directly at the satellite's fuel tank.

While the debris will not pass near enough to the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Space%20Station"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt; to cause disruption, it is not clear whether it could affect spacecraft passing through the lower orbit in which USA-193 currently resides. For this reason, the satellite will not be destroyed until the &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle"&gt;Space Shuttle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Atlantis"&gt;♡❤Atlantis♡❤&lt;/a&gt;, which is currently conducting mission &lt;a href="w%3ASTS-122"&gt;STS-122&lt;/a&gt;, has landed. The debris caused by the satellite's destruction is expected to re-enter the atmosphere within a few weeks.

Presidential candidate &lt;a href="Hillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt;'s trip to &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Antonio%2C%20Texas"&gt;San Antonio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; renewed an intense debate about the &lt;a href="w%3AAbortion%20in%20the%20United%20States"&gt;abortion issue&lt;/a&gt;. 

The &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Democratic&lt;/a&gt; Senator held a rally at the &lt;a href="w%3ARoman%20Catholic"&gt;Roman Catholic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Mary%27s%20University%2C%20Texas"&gt;St. Mary's University&lt;/a&gt; after receiving an invitation from the school. San Antonio Archbishop &lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9%20Horacio%20G%C3%B3mez"&gt;Jose Gomez&lt;/a&gt; criticized the school for not consulting with him before offering the invitation. He stated that the candidate's &lt;a href="w%3APro-Choice"&gt;pro-choice&lt;/a&gt; position on abortion contradicts the religion's rejection of the practice and added that her "positions against the teachings of the church and life issues" should deem her ineligible for a campaign visit. The University is privately owned and separate from the Catholic Church on decision-making authority. It stated in an official press release that the University does not endorse candidates and that it understood the ideological differences between Senator Clinton and the Catholic Church. Despite this, Archbishop Gomez believed the event involved him since it occurred in his &lt;a href="wiktionary%3Aarchdiocese"&gt;archdiocese&lt;/a&gt;, and wondered why Senator Clinton decided to hold a rally at a Catholic University. 

Clinton's main strength in past primaries and caucuses have been among Latino voters who have propelled her to victories in &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Nevada"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;. Most Latinos are Roman Catholic, which might explain Clinton's visit to the University in conjunction with the upcoming March 4 Texas Primary.

<h2>Game summaries</h2>

<h3>Tampa Bay Lightning @ Philadelphia Flyers</h3>

The Lightning scored most, and first. A &lt;a href="w%3AVaclav%20Prospal"&gt;Vaclav Prospal&lt;/a&gt; goal in the first, assisted by &lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20St.%20Louis"&gt;Martin St. Louis&lt;/a&gt; started it off. The Flyers would tie the score with a &lt;a href="w%3AJoffrey%20Lupul"&gt;Joffrey Lupul&lt;/a&gt; goal, and eventually took their only lead of the game with a &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Downie"&gt;Steve Downie&lt;/a&gt; short-handed goal with 36 seconds left in the first period. The Lightning would answer back with a &lt;a href="w%3ADan%20Boyle%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;Dan Boyle&lt;/a&gt; power-play goal, also assisted by St. Louis, just two minutes into the second period; &lt;a href="w%3AJan%20Hlavac"&gt;Jan Hlavac&lt;/a&gt; would score another. St. Louis then earned his third point of the game, scoring a goal to give the Lightning a 2 goal lead after 40 minutes. Tampa Bay's &lt;a href="w%3AJason%20Ward"&gt;Jason Ward&lt;/a&gt; scored an un-assisted goal at 2:18 in the 3rd period, and &lt;a href="w%3AJeff%20Carter"&gt;Jeff Carter&lt;/a&gt; would add one for the Flyers a few minutes later, but it was too little too late.
<h3>Pittsburgh Penguins @ Carolina Hurricanes</h3>

Carolina special-teams played a huge part in their home victory against the &lt;a href="w%3ASidney%20Crosby"&gt;Sidney Crosby&lt;/a&gt;-less Penguins. &lt;a href="w%3AErik%20Cole"&gt;Erik Cole&lt;/a&gt; scored Carolina's first power-play goal 3:13 into the game. Pittsburgh's &lt;a href="w%3ABrooks%20Orpik"&gt;Brooks Orpik&lt;/a&gt; scored to tie it up by the end of 1 period. The second period started with &lt;a href="w%3AEvgeni%20Malkin"&gt;Evgeni Malkin&lt;/a&gt; extending his scoring streak to 7 games on a power-play goal. Carolina's all-star MVP &lt;a href="w%3AEric%20Staal"&gt;Eric Staal&lt;/a&gt; would tie the game on a short-handed goal to tie the score going into the second intermission. The third period was all Carolina; &lt;a href="w%3ARay%20Whitney%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;Ray Whitney&lt;/a&gt; scoring on the power play, his third point of the game. &lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Bayda"&gt;Ryan Bayda&lt;/a&gt; would add one more, assisted by &lt;a href="w%3AScott%20Walker%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;Scott Walker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGlen%20Wesley"&gt;Glen Wesley&lt;/a&gt;.

Hurricanes captain and team scoring leader &lt;a href="w%3ARod%20Brind%27Amour"&gt;Rod Brind'Amour&lt;/a&gt; left the game early after a collision with Penguins &lt;a href="w%3ANathan%20Smith%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;Nathan Smith&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGeorges%20Laraque"&gt;Georges Laraque&lt;/a&gt;. He is reported as having a torn &lt;a href="w%3AAnterior%20cruciate%20ligament"&gt;ACL&lt;/a&gt; in his left knee, and may not be able to take to the ice for 4-6 months.
<h3>New York Islanders @ Toronto Maple Leafs</h3>

The Islanders picked up their second straight victory against the struggling Leafs. The Islanders scored first on a &lt;a href="w%3ABryan%20Berard"&gt;Bryan Berard&lt;/a&gt; power-play goal late in the first period. Toronto would tie the score in the second period on a &lt;a href="w%3ADarcy%20Tucker"&gt;Darcy Tucker&lt;/a&gt; goal. Leafs captain &lt;a href="w%3AMats%20Sundin"&gt;Mats Sundin&lt;/a&gt; would also score to give Toronto their only lead of the game. &lt;a href="w%3ARuslan%20Fedotenko"&gt;Ruslan Fedotenko&lt;/a&gt; scored for the Islanders, his first of two power-play goals, followed by a &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Comrie"&gt;Mike Comrie&lt;/a&gt; power-play goal. In the third period, Fedotenko scored his second power-play goal at 4:29. Toronto would score a power-play goal of their own, but the Islanders would score late in the game with a &lt;a href="w%3AFreddy%20Meyer"&gt;Freddy Meyer&lt;/a&gt; goal, eventually the game-winning goal. A Leafs goal by &lt;a href="w%3AAlexei%20Ponikarovsky"&gt;Alexei Ponikarovsky&lt;/a&gt; would cut New York's lead by half, but with only 19 seconds left in the game, they couldn't put another puck past Islander goalie &lt;a href="w%3ARick%20DiPietro"&gt;Rick DiPietro&lt;/a&gt;, who stopped 16 of Toronto's 18 3rd period shots.
<h3>Chicago Blackhawks @ Nashville Predators</h3>

Chicago's offense has been coming up with goals everywhere lately, scoring 13 in their last two games while only allowing 3. &lt;a href="w%3ADuncan%20Keith"&gt;Duncan Keith&lt;/a&gt; scored first just over a minute into the first period. &lt;a href="w%3AJonathan%20Toews"&gt;Jonathan Toews&lt;/a&gt; would score a pair of goals later in the period, his 16th and 17th of the season. This would lead Nashville to replace their goaltender &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Mason"&gt;Chris Mason&lt;/a&gt;, who gave up 3 goals on 7 shots, with &lt;a href="w%3ADan%20Ellis"&gt;Dan Ellis&lt;/a&gt;, but he wouldn't do much better. &lt;a href="w%3ARene%20Bourque"&gt;Rene Bourque&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACameron%20Barker"&gt;Cameron Barker&lt;/a&gt; would add to the Blackhawk's lead with a pair of goals in the second period less than a minute apart. &lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Sharp"&gt;Patrick Sharp&lt;/a&gt; would also score in the third, his 27th of the season, which Towes assisted in, to put the Blackhawks up by 6. Nashville captain &lt;a href="w%3AJason%20Arnott"&gt;Jason Arnott&lt;/a&gt; would stop Chicago goaltender &lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Lalime"&gt;Patrick Lalime&lt;/a&gt;'s shutout attempt, scoring on the power-play at 6:12 in the third period, but that would be the only goal Nashville would score.
<h3>St. Louis Blues @ Colorado Avalanche</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Kariya"&gt;Paul Kariya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJay%20McClement"&gt;Jay McClement&lt;/a&gt; scored a goal each in the first period for the Blues. &lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Johnson%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;Ryan Johnson&lt;/a&gt; added to St. Louis' lead with a short-handed goal early in the second period. &lt;a href="w%3ABen%20Guite"&gt;Ben Guite&lt;/a&gt; would put the Avalanche on the board at 3:03 in the third period. &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Backes%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;David Backes&lt;/a&gt; scored on an empty net to salt the victory for the Blues. &lt;a href="w%3AManny%20Legace"&gt;Manny Legace&lt;/a&gt; made 39 saves, improving his record for the season to 21-15-5.
<h3>Dallas Stars @ Phoenix Coyotes</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3ASteven%20Reinprecht"&gt;Steven Reinprecht&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARadim%20Vrbata"&gt;Radim Vrbata&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AShane%20Doan"&gt;Shane Doan&lt;/a&gt; each had a three night as the Phoenix Coyotes picked up their first victory in five games, and their first since the reinstatement of associate coach &lt;a href="w%3ARick%20Tocchet"&gt;Rick Tocchet&lt;/a&gt;, who had taken a two-year leave of absence from the team following an involvement in an illegal gambling operation. Doan would score first for Phoenix on the power-play, with Reinprecht and Vrbata picking up the assists. Dallas would answer back with an unassisted goal by &lt;a href="w%3AJussi%20Jokinen"&gt;Jussi Jokinen&lt;/a&gt; just minutes later. Phoenix would again take the lead before the period was over on a &lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Carcillo"&gt;Daniel Carcillo&lt;/a&gt; goal, which was also assisted by Reinprecht and Vrbata. &lt;a href="w%3ANiko%20Kapanen"&gt;Niko Kapanen&lt;/a&gt; would increase Phoenix's lead late in the second period. Vrbata would score a short-handed goal, his third point of the night, which Doan assisted in. &lt;a href="w%3AMatt%20Niskanen"&gt;Matt Niskanen&lt;/a&gt; would cut the Coyotes' lead by 1 less than halfway through the final period. An empty net goal by &lt;a href="w%3ANick%20Boynton"&gt;Nick Boynton&lt;/a&gt; would put the icing on the cake, which was assisted by Reinprecht and Doan.
<h3>Minnesota Wild @ Vancouver Canucks</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3AStephane%20Veilleux%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;Stephane Veilleux&lt;/a&gt; had his first career two-goal game, scoring in both the first and second periods for the Wild. &lt;a href="w%3AAlex%20Burrows"&gt;Alex Burrows&lt;/a&gt; would cut the Minnesota lead in half before the second period ended. The Canucks would gain the lead early in the third, with two goals by &lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Kesler"&gt;Ryan Kesler&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Edler"&gt;Alexander Edler&lt;/a&gt;, which were scored just 16 seconds apart. The Wild would retake the lead about ten minutes later, after &lt;a href="w%3AKurtis%20Foster"&gt;Kurtis Foster&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMarian%20Gaborik"&gt;Marian Gaborik&lt;/a&gt; each scored, Gaborik's being his 30th of the season. Vancouver would tie the score late in the third period when Edler scored his second goal of the game right off a face-off to send the game into overtime, and after a scoreless 5 minutes, a shootout. Minnesota goalie &lt;a href="w%3ANicklas%20Backstrom"&gt;Nicklas Backstrom&lt;/a&gt; stopped Vancouver's first two attempts by Edler and &lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Shannon"&gt;Ryan Shannon&lt;/a&gt;, but allowed the third goal to &lt;a href="w%3ATrevor%20Linden"&gt;Trevor Linden&lt;/a&gt;. Canuck goaltender &lt;a href="w%3ARoberto%20Luongo"&gt;Roberto Luongo&lt;/a&gt; stopped Gaborik's attempt, but allowed goals from both &lt;a href="w%3ABrent%20Burns"&gt;Brent Burns&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMikko%20Koivu"&gt;Mikko Koivu&lt;/a&gt; to give Minnesota the extra point in the standings.
<h3>Edmonton Oilers @ San Jose Sharks</h3>

After a scoreless first, &lt;a href="w%3AAles%20Hemsky"&gt;Ales Hemsky&lt;/a&gt; scored a power-play goal early in the second period for Edmonton. &lt;a href="w%3AKyle%20Brodziak"&gt;Kyle Brodziak&lt;/a&gt; would increase their lead later in the period. &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Pavelski"&gt;Joe Pavelski&lt;/a&gt; would put the Sharks on the board later in the period to cut the Oilers' lead in half. The Oilers would get the two goal lead back at 3:33 in the third period on a &lt;a href="w%3AFernando%20Pisani"&gt;Fernando Pisani&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Grier"&gt;Mike Grier&lt;/a&gt; would answer back for the Sharks with a short-handed goals 5 minutes later. The Oilers' one goal lead would hold, giving Edmonton their 4th win in 5 games.
<h2>Other news</h2>

&lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Zednik"&gt;Richard Zednik&lt;/a&gt; is expected to be released from Buffalo General Hospital Saturday, after having his &lt;a href="w%3Acartoid%20artery"&gt;cartoid artery&lt;/a&gt; severed with a skate during a game on February 10.

The &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20Capitals"&gt;Washington Capitals&lt;/a&gt; signed left winger &lt;a href="w%3ATomas%20Fleischmann"&gt;Tomas Fleischmann&lt;/a&gt; to a two-year contract extension. Fleischmann has scored 6 goals and 15 assists this season.

&lt;a href="w%3ALake%20Kivu"&gt;Lake Kivu&lt;/a&gt;, which is on the border between the &lt;a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20Congo"&gt;Democratic Republic of Congo&lt;/a&gt; (DRC) and &lt;a href="Rwanda"&gt;Rwanda&lt;/a&gt;, has been hit by an earthquake that measured 5.4 on the &lt;a href="w%3ARichter%20Scale"&gt;Richter Scale&lt;/a&gt;. This earthquake is the third to hit the area this month and follows an earthquake that took place 11 days ago and killed almost 40 people.

"Some houses have collapsed and there are injuries, but I do not yet have the details," said the mayor of the city on the DRC side of the border. "A lot of people left their homes during the night," he said. The area is on the &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20African%20Rift%20System"&gt;East African Rift System&lt;/a&gt;, which is what causes the earthquake to form. The mayor of the town on the Rwandan side of the border said, "The houses that came down are mainly those devastated by the February 3 earthquake." 

This Earthquake has a lower magnitude than the two previous earthquakes, which measured 6.0 and 7.0 on the Richter scale.

Wikinews was notified last night that Frank Zilaitis is switching gears, by dumping his Presidential campaign, and going after a seat in Congress, for &lt;a href="w%3AFlorida%27s%2015th%20congressional%20district"&gt;Florida's District 15&lt;/a&gt;. He has launched a "Frankly Frank" campaign.

He says that he has always intended on running for the position, no matter whether the incumbent was returning or not.

Just weeks ago, Zilaitis told television reporters from Central &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; News 13 that "I actually believe -- and I have no choice but to believe -- that I can be the next 44th president of the United States of America."

Previously, in 2006, Zilaitis ran for circuit judge in Group 20 of the 18th Judicial Circuit, in Florida's Seminole and &lt;a href="Brevard%20County"&gt;Brevard&lt;/a&gt; counties.

At least three more Central Florida remain, and there are apparently 30 Floridians seeking the White House altogether.

&lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;n national Marwoto Komar has been released on bail having earlier been arrested over the March 7 crash of a &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing"&gt;Boeing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20737"&gt;737&lt;/a&gt; he was piloting. &lt;a href="w%3AGaruda%20Indonesia"&gt;Garuda Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGaruda%20Indonesia%20Flight%20200"&gt;Flight 200&lt;/a&gt; overshot the runway at &lt;a href="w%3AYogyakarta%20Airport"&gt;Yogyakarta Airport&lt;/a&gt; whilst landing after a scheduled domestic passenger flight, leaving 21 Indonesian and &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n passengers dead, out of 140 on board.

The subsequent investigation by the National Transport Safety Committee concluded with report released in November that found the aircraft had approached at far in excess of safe landing speeds, with Komar ignoring 15 activations of the &lt;a href="w%3AGround%20Proximity%20Warning%20System"&gt;Ground Proximity Warning System&lt;/a&gt; (GPWS) as well as his co-pilot requesting an emergency &lt;a href="w%3Ago-around"&gt;go-around&lt;/a&gt; as the plane touched down.

Muchtar Yudhi, legal representative of Mr Komar, told ♡❤El Shinta♡❤ radio today that authorities had accepted a request to release Komar on bail, he having been arrested nearly two weeks ago in &lt;a href="w%3AYogyakarta"&gt;Yogyakarta&lt;/a&gt;. He said Komar remains a suspect of manslaugher, but that he will continue to co-operate with police.

He also said that under global aviation law "if a plane crash occurred, the pilot cannot face criminal investigation".

The police say they intend to prosecute him for negligence and will now charge him when he returns to court. He is thought to be the first pilot to be prosecuted over a crash in Indonesian history, which also contains a poor aviation safety record.

The Indonesian Pilot's Association has also said that the criminal prosecution should be avoided, arguing that the only people who can judge whether mistakes were made in aviation are those professionally involved and not the police. There were protests in &lt;a href="w%3AJakarta"&gt;Jakarta&lt;/a&gt; demanding his release and dozens of pilots across the nation also campaigned. Two survivors, Adrianus Meliala and Retno Gunowati, went to the House of Representatives (DPR) on Wednesday to challenge those opposed to legal processes against the pilot.

The &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Federation%20of%20Air%20Line%20Pilots%20Associations"&gt;International Federation of Air Line Pilots Associations&lt;/a&gt; (IFALPA) commented that they were "saddened" to hear the news. IFALPA contends that further investigations are needed into the crash, and that criminal proceedings could prevent an accurate version of events from ever being known. A statement was released that read as follows: "The Federation expects that Capt. Komar will be released ... as he has agreed to fully cooperate with the police investigation and clearly poses no danger to society. He remains a professional who was involved in an unfortunate tragedy." 

, Australian foreign minister at the time of the crash, earlier said "...I am very glad that they have reached a point now where they have charged the captain of the aircraft." Several people involved were Australian journalists following Downer on a visit to Indonesia.

"Thanks to the chief of the Indonesian Police and the chief of Yogyakarta Police... I'm glad now that I can meet my family again." Komar said upon his release.

Komar has earlier been under police surveillance, during which time he was receiving psychological treatment. He has had his pilot's license suspended.

Star of one of the longest-running shows in television history, 79-year-old Chris Wedes is celebrating half a century since he became "Julius Pierpont Patches".

From 1958 to 1981, CBS affiliate &lt;a href="w%3AKIRO-TV"&gt;KIRO-TV&lt;/a&gt; produced ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AJ.%20P.%20Patches"&gt;The J.P. Patches Show&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. The show featured J.P., the Mayor of the City Dump, who lived in a shack with multiple characters visiting. Virtually the entire supporting cast, male and female, human or non-human, was played by the versatile Bob Newman.

The character itself is more than 50 years old.

J. P. Patches was created at NBC-affiliate &lt;a href="w%3AKARE"&gt;WTCN&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="w%3ADaryl%20Laub"&gt;Daryl Laub&lt;/a&gt;. When he left for &lt;a href="w%3AKSTP-TV"&gt;KSTP-TV&lt;/a&gt;, also in Minnesota, the character was taken over by Wedes. (Wedes was then an actor, DJ, and kids TV cook.) In 1958, Wedes moved to Seattle, to become the first floor director at KIRO-TV, bringing ♡❤The J.P. Patches Show♡❤ with him. (Laub, meanwhile, created T. N. Tatters at another station.) The show aired twice a day for 13 years, and once on Saturdays, for 8 more years just in the morning, and for the final two years only on Saturday morning. In total, an estimated 12,000 shows made the air, all of them live, with next to no budget.

Wedes told the ♡❤Everett Herald♡❤ that: "I'm still amazed at the longevity of the character. When I go on appearances, I get hugs, I get tears, I get laughter. The people are so in love with J.P. Patches. I can't believe it that it has hung on that long."

Businesses paid Wedes and the station to appear in character at grand openings, appeared at a &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing"&gt;Boeing&lt;/a&gt; Christmas party with an audience of 55,000, and appeared on Darigold milk containers, Sunbeam bread bags, and Dankens ice cream lids. Even still, the image has been licensed for bobble heads and an action figure. The book "J.P. Patches: Northwest Icon" was published in 2002.

While the cartoons were airing, Wedes' Patches would greet guest children; the waiting list was for a while six months long. Children who stopped by include now-billionaire &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Gates"&gt;Bill Gates&lt;/a&gt;, and former Washington Governor &lt;a href="w%3AGary%20Locke"&gt;Gary Locke&lt;/a&gt;.

Celebrities appearing on the show included politicians, Olympic medalists, comedian &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Allen"&gt;Steve Allen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABurt%20Ward"&gt;Burt "Robin" Ward&lt;/a&gt; of ♡❤Batman♡❤, folk singer &lt;a href="w%3ATiny%20Tim"&gt;Tiny Tim&lt;/a&gt;, actress &lt;a href="w%3ADebbie%20Reynolds"&gt;Debbie Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;, oceanographer &lt;a href="w%3AJacques%20Cousteau"&gt;Jacques Cousteau&lt;/a&gt;, and Colonel &lt;a href="w%3AHarland%20Sanders"&gt;Harland Sanders&lt;/a&gt;, the founder of &lt;a href="w%3AKentucky%20Fried%20Chicken"&gt;Kentucky Fried Chicken&lt;/a&gt;.

Some parents objected to KIRO-TV dropping the national series ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACaptain%20Kangaroo"&gt;Captain Kangaroo&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, three years into its run, to put in ♡❤Patches♡❤.

A minor controversy erupted when a local newspaper photographed Wedes, being taken in an ambulance when involved in a car crash, not of his own fault. The official site reads that "The picture distressed many local children and would remain an embarrassment to the local media if they actually had any shame."

There are still enough "Patches Pals", fans of the show, that a statue is planned for Seattle's Fremont neighborhood. To be completed this summer, the fundraiser is just $55,000 away from the $165,000 needed for the sculpture of Patches with Gertrude, the character's girlfriend.

They've so far donated $110,000 of $165,000 to cast a bronze statue of J.P. Patches and his sidekick Gertrude to be placed in the Fremont neighborhood of Seattle. More money is still needed for the statue, being made by a Sultan sculptor and completed this summer. Any money raised that isn't needed for the statue, coordinated by the local chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, goes to the &lt;a href="w%3AChildren%27s%20Hospital%20and%20Regional%20Medical%20Center%20%28Seattle%29"&gt;Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center&lt;/a&gt; in Seattle; the statue itself will have a slot to collect money for the hospital. Billboards around the region track the fundraising progress.

Wedes was diagnosed in October with a controllable but incurable blood cancer, "&lt;a href="w%3AMultiple%20myeloma"&gt;acute myeloma&lt;/a&gt;". He had to avoid public appearance until recently, due to the told of dialysis. He made seven county fair appearances in 2007, and 30 other gigs. Newman often joins him to perform, despite have &lt;a href="w%3Amultiple%20sclerosis"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; for the past 20 years.

The two will appear in "An Evening With JP Patches &amp; Gertrude: The Men Behind The Makeup", April 5 at The 7th Street Theatre in Hoquiam.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Wikinews%20interviews%20Frank%20McEnulty%2C%20independent%20candidate%20for%20US%20President&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
While nearly all cover of the 2008 Presidential election has focused on the Democratic and Republican candidates, there are small political parties offering candidates, and those who choose to run without a party behind them, independents.

Wikinews is interviewing some of these citizens who are looking to become the 43rd person elected to serve their nation from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW.

First off is Long Beach, California's ♡❤♡Frank McEnulty♡❤♡ (b. 1956), a married father of two with an MBA (Venture Management) and BS (Accounting/Finance).

<h2>Interview</h2>

♡❤♡Why do you want to be President?♡❤♡ 

♡❤♡Have you ever run for political office before? (President, senate, congress, city councillor, school trustee... etc.) Have you ever been a member of a political party, other than the one you're currently in?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Have you ever campaigned for another political candidate?♡❤♡

♡❤♡What is your current job?♡❤♡

♡❤♡What skills or ideas do you bring from this position, or previous positions, that will benefit the Oval Office?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Obviously, the next American President and his or her administration will face many diverse issues. But if you were to narrow identify the three most important issues, what would they be? How will you address these issues?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Campaigning for the American presidency is one of the most expensive exercises in the world. How do you deal with the cost and fundraising?♡❤♡

♡❤♡What are you/were you looking for in a running mate?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Can you win the 2008 Presidential election?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Can any third party or independent candidate ever win?♡❤♡

♡❤♡If you can't make it into the Oval Office, who would you prefer seeing taking the presidency?♡❤♡

♡❤♡What should the American people keep in mind, when heading to the polls this November?♡❤♡

<h1>STS-122 astronauts perform third spacewalk</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=STS-122%20astronauts%20perform%20third%20spacewalk&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Two astronauts have performed the third and final spacewalk, or &lt;a href="w%3AExtra-vehicular%20activity"&gt;Extra-vehicular activity&lt;/a&gt; (EVA), of the &lt;a href="w%3ASTS-%20122"&gt;STS- 122&lt;/a&gt; mission. &lt;a href="w%3ARex%20Walheim"&gt;Rex Walheim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AStan%20Love"&gt;Stan Love&lt;/a&gt; began the spacewalk at 13:07 GMT, departing the &lt;a href="w%3AQuest%20airlock"&gt;Quest airlock&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Space%20Station"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt; (ISS). The EVA ended with their return to the airlock, seven hours and 25 minutes later, at 20:32 GMT.

The goals of the spacewalk were to install two experiments onto the outside of the newly delivered &lt;a href="w%3AColumbus%20module"&gt;♡❤Columbus♡❤ module&lt;/a&gt; of the space station, and to load a failed gyroscope onto the visiting &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle"&gt;Space Shuttle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Atlantis"&gt;♡❤Atlantis♡❤&lt;/a&gt;, for return to Earth next Wednesday. The gyroscope, CMG-3 was one of four used to control the space station's attitude. It was replaced during an EVA made by the &lt;a href="w%3ASTS-118"&gt;STS-118&lt;/a&gt; crew during August 2007. It has been stored outside the Space Station since then, awaiting collection.

The experiments installed on the ♡❤Columbus♡❤ module are a solar observatory, SOLAR, and a materials research experiment, EuTEF. Subsequent to this, the astronauts fitted handrails to the ♡❤Columbus♡❤ module, to assist with future EVAs. Following the successful completion of these primary tasks, the astronauts performed several other tasks, which included collecting safety tethers from previous EVAs, and inspecting micrometeroite damage on a handrail.

This is the 104 spacewalk conducted as part of the &lt;a href="International%20Space%20Station"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt; programme.

<h2>Game summaries</h2>

<h3>Atlanta Thrashers @ New Jersey Devils</h3>

New Jersey scored first on a &lt;a href="w%3AZach%20Parise"&gt;Zach Parise&lt;/a&gt; goal late in the first period. &lt;a href="w%3ABrian%20Gionta"&gt;Brian Gionta&lt;/a&gt; would give the Devils a 2 goal lead in the second period, but Atlanta would cut their deficit in half less than a minute later with an &lt;a href="w%3AIlya%20Kovalchuk"&gt;Ilya Kovalchuk&lt;/a&gt; goal. &lt;a href="w%3ATodd%20White"&gt;Todd White&lt;/a&gt; would tie the score on a power-play goal. The Devils would retake the lead in the third period on a goal by &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Madden%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;John Madden&lt;/a&gt;, but the Thrashers would score on a &lt;a href="w%3AMarian%20Hossa"&gt;Marian Hossa&lt;/a&gt; goal with 19 seconds left to send the game to overtime. After a scoreless 5 minutes of 4-on-4 hockey, the game went into a shootout. After nine rounds ending with a tie, it was &lt;a href="w%3APascal%20Dupuis"&gt;Pascal Dupuis&lt;/a&gt; who scored on &lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20Brodeur"&gt;Martin Brodeur&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AJohan%20Hedberg"&gt;Johan Hedberg&lt;/a&gt; stopped &lt;a href="w%3AArron%20Asham"&gt;Arron Asham&lt;/a&gt; to give the Thrashers their first win against the Devils this season.
<h3>Washington Capitals @ Florida Panthers</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3ARostislav%20Olesz"&gt;Rostislav Olesz&lt;/a&gt; made his return to the Panthers lineup after injuring his hand on January 16, and scored the first goal 5:52 into the game. &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Semin"&gt;Alexander Semin&lt;/a&gt; would score on an a Washington power-play early in the second period to tie the score at one goal a piece. &lt;a href="w%3ATomas%20Fleischmann"&gt;Tomas Fleischmann&lt;/a&gt; earned his two-year contract extension by giving Washington their first lead of the game in the opening minute of the third period, his 7th of the season. &lt;a href="w%3ANathan%20Horton"&gt;Nathan Horton&lt;/a&gt; would re-tie the score 3 minutes later, but the Panthers would retake the lead on a &lt;a href="w%3AKamil%20Kreps"&gt;Kamil Kreps&lt;/a&gt; goal at 8:27 in the third. &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Booth"&gt;David Booth&lt;/a&gt; would salt the Panthers victory with an empty net goal in the final minute of the game. Florida now sits tied with two other teams, including Washington, with 60 points in the Southeast Division.
<h3>Columbus Blue Jackets @ Detroit Red Wings</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3ARick%20Nash"&gt;Rick Nash&lt;/a&gt; put the Jackets on the board first, and &lt;a href="w%3AFredrik%20Modin"&gt;Fredrik Modin&lt;/a&gt; added another for Columbus a few minutes later, assisted by Nash. It was then &lt;a href="w%3ANikolai%20Zherdev"&gt;Nikolai Zherdev&lt;/a&gt; who put the Blue Jackets ahead by 3 less than two minutes later. Modin would score his second goal of the night, and Nash his third point of the game with a second assist, at 11:18 in the second period to add to Columbus' lead. Detroit would then replace their goaltender &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Osgood"&gt;Chris Osgood&lt;/a&gt;, for the second straight game, with their backup goalie &lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Howard%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;Jim Howard&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ADominik%20Hasek"&gt;Dominik Hasek&lt;/a&gt;, who is usually Detroit's backup goaltender is out due to an injured hip flexor). &lt;a href="w%3APavel%20Datsyuk"&gt;Pavel Datsyuk&lt;/a&gt; would put Detroit on the board early in the 3rd period with a power-play goal. Columbus would answer with a &lt;a href="w%3ARon%20Hainsey"&gt;Ron Hainsey&lt;/a&gt; goal to put the Jackets back up by 4, a lead that would hold through the rest of the game, and give the Detroit Red Wings, the top ranked team in the NHL, their fifth straight loss.
<h3>Dallas Stars @ Anaheim Ducks</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3ATeemu%20Selanne"&gt;Teemu Selanne&lt;/a&gt; made his return to the Honda Center after coming out of retirement during Anaheim's 9 game road-trip. &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Kunitz"&gt;Chris Kunitz&lt;/a&gt; put the Ducks on the board first early in the game. &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Ribeiro"&gt;Mike Ribeiro&lt;/a&gt; scored on a 5-on-3 power-play to tie the score for the Stars. With Dallas on the power-play in the second period, &lt;a href="w%3AStephane%20Robidas"&gt;Stephane Robidas&lt;/a&gt; gave the Stars their first lead of the game with a slap-shot from just inside the blue-line that Anaheim goaltender &lt;a href="w%3AJean-Sebastien%20Giguere"&gt;Jean-Sebastien Giguere&lt;/a&gt; didn't see coming. Late in the second period, Dallas would take advantage of their second 5-on-3 power-play when Robidas scored his second goal of the game in the closing minutes of the second period. Kunitz would score his second goal, which deflected off the skate of Stars defender &lt;a href="w%3ANicklas%20Grossman"&gt;Nicklas Grossman&lt;/a&gt; and past goaltender &lt;a href="w%3AMarty%20Turco"&gt;Marty Turco&lt;/a&gt;, to cut the lead in half. An empty-net goal by &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Ott"&gt;Steve Ott&lt;/a&gt; in the final seconds of the game iced the Stars 8th victory in 9 games, and snapped Anaheim's 5 game winning streak.
<h3>Calgary Flames @ Los Angeles Kings</h3>

The Calgary Flames are 3-0-0 in their season series with the Los Angeles Kings. &lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Dallman"&gt;Kevin Dallman&lt;/a&gt; started the scoring for the Kings, his first goal of this NHL season, his second career goal as a King. &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Frolov"&gt;Alexander Frolov&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ADerek%20Armstrong"&gt;Derek Armstrong&lt;/a&gt; assisted. &lt;a href="w%3ADaymond%20Langkow"&gt;Daymond Langkow&lt;/a&gt; would tie the score just over a minute later, but Los Angeles would answer with a &lt;a href="w%3ABrian%20Boyle%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;Brian Boyle&lt;/a&gt; goal at 6:02 in the first period, also assisted by Frolov and Armstrong. &lt;a href="w%3ATeddy%20Purcell"&gt;Teddy Purcell&lt;/a&gt; scored his first career NHL goal at 8:59 to put the Kings up by 2. Dustin Boyd would cut Los Angeles' lead in half with a &lt;a href="w%3ADustin%20Boyd"&gt;Dustin Boyd&lt;/a&gt; goal at 12:59. &lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20O%27Sullivan%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;Patrick O'Sullivan&lt;/a&gt; would score a short-handed goal to increase the Los Angeles lead by 2. Armstrong would increase that lead a few minutes later, which was assisted by Frolov, to give each their 3rd points of the game. &lt;a href="w%3AAnze%20Kopitar"&gt;Anze Kopitar&lt;/a&gt; would also score for the Kings, assisted by O'Sullivan, to give Los Angeles a 4 goal lead just after the halfway point of the game. Calgary would answer with a goal by &lt;a href="w%3AOwen%20Nolan"&gt;Owen Nolan&lt;/a&gt; at 5:15 in the third period, but couldn't come up with more goals, despite outshooting the Kings 25-5 in the third period.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Gunman%20at%20Illinois%20campus%20said%20to%20have%20stopped%20taking%20medication&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

After the death of five students in &lt;a href="w%3AIllinois"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt; from the shooting Thursday, in which police say a former graduate student entered a university classroom at &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Illinois%20University"&gt;Northern Illinois University&lt;/a&gt; with several guns and opened fire, hitting over 20 people before taking his own life, a day later students are expressing shock.

Students today held a vigil for the 5 dead students, who died after the gunman entered the hall dressed in black and carrying a shotgun and three hand guns and began firing as students sought cover under desks. One student who escaped unharmed told reporters his life has changed as a result of what he experienced.

"I am going to be in class from now on, looking over my shoulder, because if he would have come through the back door, I would not be here right now. I would have been dead," he said.

Police say the gunman was &lt;a href="w%3ASteven%20Kazmierczak"&gt;Steven Kazmierczak&lt;/a&gt;, 27, a former graduate student in &lt;a href="w%3ASociology"&gt;Sociology&lt;/a&gt; at the school. Police say he purchased the shotgun and two of the handguns on Saturday, indicating he may have planned the attack in advance, but authorities have not determined a motive for the shooting.

Kazmierczak had no criminal record but had been a patient for a year at Thresholds-Mary Hill House, a psychiatric treatment center for teens. Under Illinois state law he would not have been able to purchase a weapon legally if there had been a record of arrests or mental problems, but police said he had stopped taking an unspecified medication recently and his behavior had become erratic. 

Kazmierczak received a Dean's Award from the university's Sociology Department in 2006. He served as a member of the school's Academic Criminal Justice Association and was considered a good student, but he was not enrolled this semester.

Thursday, police arrived on the scene of the shooting within two minutes, but they were too late. Witnesses say the gunman fired multiple shots in a matter of seconds, reloaded, fired some more and then took his own life. 

In Washington Friday, President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush&lt;/a&gt; reacted to the shooting. "This morning I spoke to the President of Northern Illinois University," said Mr. Bush. "I told the President that a lot of folks today will be praying for the families of the victims and for the Northern Illinois University community. Obviously a tragic situation on that campus, and I ask our fellow citizens to offer their blessings, blessings of comfort and blessings of strength."

This is the latest in a string of shootings at U.S. schools in recent years, the worst being the shooting at &lt;a href="w%3AVirginia%20Tech%20University"&gt;Virginia Tech University&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ABlacksburg"&gt;Blacksburg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Virginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; 10 months ago that left 32 students and teachers dead. That incident ranks as the deadliest armed rampage in U.S. history. The shooter also killed himself in that case.

&lt;a href="w%3AActivision"&gt;Activision&lt;/a&gt;, publisher of the popular ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AGuitar%20Hero%20%28series%29"&gt;Guitar Hero&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ series of video games which simulate the playing of &lt;a href="w%3Arock%20music"&gt;rock music&lt;/a&gt;, has unveiled the next title in the franchise: ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AGuitar%20Hero%3A%20Aerosmith"&gt;Guitar Hero: Aerosmith&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

The game, which will focus entirely on the top-selling American rock band &lt;a href="w%3AAerosmith"&gt;Aerosmith&lt;/a&gt;, is set to be released this June. The soundtrack will be composed of songs performed by Aerosmith or otherwise related to the band. Venues featured in the game will highlight different points in the band's career. 

"The premise is that it's going to cover the 30-plus years of the band, from high school all the way through the rock superstardom of today," said Kai Huang, head of &lt;a href="w%3ARedOctane"&gt;RedOctane&lt;/a&gt;, a subsidiary of Activision.

Developers even held motion-capture sessions with members of the band so they can appear in-game.

"We've put a lot of ideas into the game so that fans can have fun interacting with our music, getting inside our body of work and learning about the band's history," said Aerosmith guitarist, &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Perry"&gt;Joe Perry&lt;/a&gt;.

Perry also commented on the effect he hopes the game will have on the music business. "On a larger scale, it's cool for us to be pioneers helping to rebuild the music industry through a format like video games. It's great for rock since the record companies are struggling to make sense of how things are changing. Fans want to get and experience music in new formats--and there are going to be some of them who will play the game, then pick up the guitar for real and start bands. It's what's happening now, and it's only going to build more momentum in the future. It's a massive change for the music business."

The game will be released for &lt;a href="w%3AXbox%20360"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APlaystation%203"&gt;Playstation 3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AWii"&gt;Wii&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3APlaystation%202"&gt;Playstation 2&lt;/a&gt;. It has not yet been rated by the &lt;a href="w%3AESRB"&gt;ESRB&lt;/a&gt;.

Former President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20H.%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George H. W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; is reported to have offered his endorsement to Senator &lt;a href="John%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20U.S.%20presidential%20election"&gt;2008 U.S. presidential election&lt;/a&gt;. This comes as former Presidential candidate and Governor of Massachusetts &lt;a href="Mitt%20Romney"&gt;Mitt Romney&lt;/a&gt; announced his support for McCain on Friday after a bitter primary battle with the Senator, which ended after Romney exited the race following less than stellar results on &lt;a href="w%3ASuper%20Tuesday"&gt;Super Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. 

Romney, who once referred to McCain as a "liberal Democrat", had a change of heart as he stood by the Senator's side and described McCain as "...a man capable of leading our country at a dangerous hour." McCain accepted the endorsement and thanked the governor. Romney will hand McCain the 280 delegates he won while participating in primaries and caucuses during his campaign. 

The endorsement from the 83-year-old former president and father of current &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; ends his official neutrality on the 2008 presidential race. However, a correlation may exist from the proximity of the endorsements as the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20Post"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reports that Bush gave "indications" earlier in the race that he was on Romney's side, citing the facts that many Bush aides worked for Romney and that Romney's 2007 was set at the &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20H.%20W.%20Bush%20presidential%20library"&gt;George H. W. Bush presidential library&lt;/a&gt;. Nevertheless, the backing marks the second from a former President in the 2008 race, assuming that &lt;a href="Bill%20Clinton"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt; supports his wife, &lt;a href="Hillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary&lt;/a&gt;.

In the weekend of the &lt;a href="2008%20Taipei%20International%20Book%20Exhibition"&gt;2008 Taipei International Book Exhibition&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20World%20Trade%20Center"&gt;Taipei World Trade Center&lt;/a&gt;, several participating publishers from Comic Hall (Hall 2) and General Book Hall (TWTC Hall 1) successively held several signing, meeting, and seminar events for different reading populations. Especially in the Comic Hall, several fans had waited for a long time before the opening hour.

In the Signing Area of Comic Hall, due to several notable Japanese authors arriving for the signing events, the organizers restricted the flow of participants through the signing area. Not only the Comic Hall, since several entertainers from &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; came to the TWTC Hall 1, several media and drama fans expected some signing events in Hall 1.

With several signing, meeting, and seminar events this weekend, good weather in Taipei, and the 2008 Taipei Lantern Festival held in the Xinyi Shopping Area and Taipei City Hall Square, the TBFF predicted that the peak of visitors will be determined with those events above, weekend hours, and extensions of the opening hour.

Chemists modeling the structure of strongly &lt;a href="w%3Aacid"&gt;acidic&lt;/a&gt; solutions have found that &lt;a href="w%3Ahydronium"&gt;hydronium ions&lt;/a&gt; can associate into unusual &lt;a href="w%3Aion"&gt;ion&lt;/a&gt; pairs.

Hydronium ions form whenever an acid dissolves in water, but it had always been assumed that they would repel each other. This new work suggests that at certain &lt;a href="w%3Aconcentration"&gt;concentration&lt;/a&gt;s a fraction of the hydronium ions can in fact pair up. 

Gregory A. Voth and Sergei Izvekov of the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Utah"&gt;University of Utah&lt;/a&gt;, in collaboration with Feng Wang of &lt;a href="w%3ABoston%20University"&gt;Boston University&lt;/a&gt;, were examining the structure of highly acidic solutions (pH 0 to 1) of &lt;a href="w%3Ahydrochloric%20acid"&gt;hydrochloric acid&lt;/a&gt; using sophisticated computer modeling. It is known that in water such acids &lt;a href="w%3ADissociation%20%28chemistry%29"&gt;dissociate&lt;/a&gt; into positive ions (cations) and negative ions (anions), with the H part &lt;a href="w%3ASolvation"&gt;solvated&lt;/a&gt; by water molecules to form cations such as hydronium (HO). It might be expected that positive ions such as these would &lt;a href="w%3AElectromagnetic%20force"&gt;repel one another&lt;/a&gt;, but it turns out that some of these cations unexpectedly associate into pairs at acid concentrations of 0.43 - 0.85 &lt;a href="w%3Amolarity"&gt;M&lt;/a&gt; . The pairing disappears at even higher concentrations where larger aggregates of cations and anions instead begin to form. The authors note that "cation pairs are stabilized by a nonclassical charge delocalization of the excess proton charge defects over multiple water molecules". They explain the phenomenon in terms of the &lt;a href="w%3AAmphiphile"&gt;amphiphilic&lt;/a&gt; nature of the hydronium ion discovered in their 2004 work.

Recent work by Wallace ♡❤et al.♡❤ indicated the presence of hydronium ion pairs in crystals, but this is the first time such an association has been predicted for an aqueous solution.

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;, accompanied by his wife &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALaura%20Bush"&gt;Laura&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , began his five-nation trip to &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; today in &lt;a href="Benin"&gt;Benin&lt;/a&gt;, where he met with President &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AYayi%20Boni"&gt;Yayi Boni&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and participated in a joint press conference. This is Bush's second visit to Africa and the first time any US president has visited Benin. Topics that were discussed included &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Amalaria"&gt;malaria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acotton"&gt;cotton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and the crises in &lt;a href="Kenya"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Darfur"&gt;Darfur&lt;/a&gt;.

At the press conference, held at Cadjehoun International Airport in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACotonou"&gt;Cotonou&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Yayi thanked Bush for coming to visit and praised him for his "great concern for Africa, its well being, and of the development of its people." Bush then commended the government of Benin for their "fight against corruption" and "firm commitment to the investment in its people". 

"Your fight against corruption is visible and easy for the people to see," Bush said. "This is such a good lesson ... because leaders around the world have got to understand that the United States wants to partner with leaders and the people, but we're not going to do so with people that steal money, pure and simple." Benin is one of the recipients of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMillennium%20Challenge%20Account"&gt;Millennium Challenge Account&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which aims to foster economic growth in countries that are deemed to have effective governments and economic freedom.

On the topic of malaria, Bush mentioned the Malaria Initiative, which intends to provide a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Amosquito%20net"&gt;mosquito net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for every child to prevent the spread of the disease. He also mentioned initiatives to facilitate the spread of &lt;a href="HIV"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="AIDS"&gt;AIDS&lt;/a&gt;. "We can save lives with an aggressive, comprehensive strategy," Bush said. "And that's exactly what you're putting in place here in Benin."
The economy was also an important issue. President Yayi said he and President Bush discussed diversifying Benin's economy away from its dependence on cotton. "He shared his vision with us, and he is encouraging us to diversify the sources of solutions to the problem that we have today, namely the cotton industry." Yayi says it is hard competing with cotton markets in &lt;a href="Asia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt; and the United States. Bush said the &lt;a href="World%20Trade%20Organization"&gt;World Trade Organization&lt;/a&gt; is willing to help Benin's economy, but he also suggested exporting more cotton-based products in addition to raw cotton.

Bush said the United States will help facilitate a peacekeeping force in Darfur, but will not send troops to the region. "I made the decision not to [send troops], upon the recommendation of a lot of the groups involved in Darfur, as well as other folks ... once you make that decision, then there's not many other avenues except for the United Nations and the peacekeeping forces."

When asked about the situation in Kenya, Bush said he has sent Secretary of State &lt;a href="Condoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; to visit the country on Monday to support former UN Secretary General &lt;a href="Kofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt; in mediating the conflict. "Kenya is an issue ... and that's why I'm sending Secretary Rice there to help the Kofi Annan initiative - all aimed at having a clear message that there be no violence and that there ought to be a power-sharing agreement," said Bush. 

White House national security adviser Stephen Hadley said Rice's visit will only last a few hours. "It's basically to go in, give some impetus, but then step out and let Kofi Annan continue his diplomacy," he said. At a press briefing aboard &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAir%20Force%20One"&gt;Air Force One&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , one reporter questioned what could be accomplished in a few hours and asked why the President didn't go to Kenya instead. Ambassador Jendayi Frazer answered with, "Secretary Rice's engagement on Kenya has been much longer than a few hours. She has been talking to &lt;a href="Mwai%20Kibaki"&gt;President Kibaki&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Raila%20Odinga"&gt;Raila Odinga&lt;/a&gt; before the election, right on the eve of the announcement, immediately after that. And so she's been very much engaged over the last three or four months on dealing with electoral crisis."

"The purpose of her going is to back Kofi's mediation, it's not to take over that mediation," Frazer continued. "President Bush does not need to go to Kenya at this point. At the right moment in time, the President will engage, but right now it's occurring in a very systematic way to back Annan's mediation, not to try to supplant Annan's mediation."

After spending three hours in Benin, Bush flew to &lt;a href="Tanzania"&gt;Tanzania&lt;/a&gt;, where he will stay for three nights. He will then continue his trip in &lt;a href="Rwanda"&gt;Rwanda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Ghana"&gt;Ghana&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Liberia"&gt;Liberia&lt;/a&gt;.

There were 10 games played in the National Hockey League on February 16, 2008, including the New York Rangers, who hadn't played since the afternoon of February 10, taking on the Buffalo Sabres.

<h2>Game summaries</h2>

<h3>Buffalo Sabres @ New York Rangers</h3>

You could tell the Rangers were hungry to score goals, due to having 5 days off. A goal scored by &lt;a href="w%3ASean%20Avery"&gt;Sean Avery&lt;/a&gt; just ten seconds into the game could tell you that. In fact, three more goals would be scored by the Rangers by the time the first period ended; &lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Callahan"&gt;Ryan Callahan&lt;/a&gt; at 4:29, &lt;a href="w%3ABrandon%20Dubinsky"&gt;Brandon Dubinsky&lt;/a&gt; at 9:05, and &lt;a href="w%3ABrendan%20Shanahan"&gt;Brendan Shanahan&lt;/a&gt; at 12:25. In the second period, Avery would score his second goal. &lt;a href="w%3AThomas%20Vanek"&gt;Thomas Vanek&lt;/a&gt; would put Buffalo on the board with a power-play goal at 13:02 in the third period. By the time it was done, Dubinsky had three points, &lt;a href="w%3AJaromir%20Jagr"&gt;Jaromir Jagr&lt;/a&gt; had a pair of assists, and the Sabres' winning streak was over at three games.
<h3>Boston Bruins @ Toronto Maple Leafs</h3>

The struggling Leafs needed a win at home, after losing 6 of their last 9 games. Boston scored first on a &lt;a href="w%3AGlen%20Murray%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;Glen Murray&lt;/a&gt; goal 5:48 into the first period. &lt;a href="w%3ADominic%20Moore"&gt;Dominic Moore&lt;/a&gt; would tie the score up just over halfway through the period. The second period was where Toronto went on the offensive, outshooting the Bruins 12-3, but couldn't get any pucks past &lt;a href="w%3ATim%20Thomas%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;Tim Thomas&lt;/a&gt;. One of Boston's three shots did go past Toronto goalkeeper &lt;a href="w%3AVesa%20Toskala"&gt;Vesa Toskala&lt;/a&gt; though, to put them up by two. In the third period, &lt;a href="w%3ADarcy%20Tucker"&gt;Darcy Tucker&lt;/a&gt; scored to tie the score at two goals a piece. That was closely followed by a &lt;a href="w%3ANik%20Antropov"&gt;Nik Antropov&lt;/a&gt; goal which Tucker assisted in, to give Toronto their first lead of the game. In the closing minute of regulation, however, Boston captain &lt;a href="w%3AZdeno%20Chara"&gt;Zdeno Chara&lt;/a&gt; scored to send the game into overtime. Tucker would win the game 3:34 into 4-on-4 overtime to win it for the Leafs.
<h3>Philadelphia Flyers @ Montreal Canadiens</h3>

The Flyers lost their sixth straight game in this low scoring game. The only goal of the game came early in the second period, when Andrei Kostitsyn, while falling down, manages to send the puck slowly past Flyers goalie Antero Niittymaki and into the net. Despite outshooting the Canadiens 15-3 in the final period, including almost 2 minutes with a 5-on-3 disadvantage, the Flyers were continuously stopped by Montreal's goaltender Carey Price, who picked up his first career NHL shutout. The Flyers and Canadiens will play the second game of a weekend series Sunday, this time in Philadelphia.
<h3>New Jersey Devils @ Ottawa Senators</h3>

The Devils travel to Ottawa, after defeating the Senators 3-2 at home, to defeat them again 3-2. &lt;a href="w%3AArron%20Ashman"&gt;Arron Ashman&lt;/a&gt; scored in the first and second periods, his seventh and eighth of the year, and &lt;a href="w%3AZach%20Parise"&gt;Zach Parise&lt;/a&gt; would add a power play goal to put the Devils up by three by the halfway point of the game. &lt;a href="w%3AJason%20Spezza"&gt;Jason Spezza&lt;/a&gt; would put the Senators on the board at 16:37 in the second, &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Kelly%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;Chris Kelly&lt;/a&gt; would cut the New Jersey lead in half in the third, but it wasn't enough, as the Senators, who started the season winning 13 of their first 14 games, lose their 6th of 9 since the All-Star break.
<h3>Atlanta Thrashers @ New York Islanders</h3>

The Islanders have rebounded from losing 7 straight to picking up their third win in a row. &lt;a href="w%3AMiroslav%20Satan"&gt;Miroslav Satan&lt;/a&gt; scored off of a &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Park"&gt;Richard Park&lt;/a&gt; centering pass at 14:52 in the first period to put the Islanders on the board. &lt;a href="w%3ARuslan%20Fedotenko"&gt;Ruslan Fedotenko&lt;/a&gt; would increase the lead early in the second period, and &lt;a href="w%3AMarc-Andre%20Bergeron"&gt;Marc-Andre Bergeron&lt;/a&gt; would score on a power-play to make it a three-goal game by the second intermission. &lt;a href="w%3ASean%20Bergenheim"&gt;Sean Bergenheim&lt;/a&gt; would be assisted by &lt;a href="w%3AFreddy%20Meyer"&gt;Freddy Meyer&lt;/a&gt; and goalie &lt;a href="w%3ARick%20DiPietro"&gt;Rick DiPietro&lt;/a&gt; in the Islanders fourth goal at 7:50 in the third period. &lt;a href="w%3ATodd%20White"&gt;Todd White&lt;/a&gt; would spoil DiPietro's shutout attempt with a late power-play goal.
<h3>Florida Panthers @ Carolina Hurricanes</h3>

Carolina forward &lt;a href="w%3AMatt%20Cullen"&gt;Matt Cullen&lt;/a&gt; made his return to the active lineup after missing 7 games after experiencing distorted vision. He assisted &lt;a href="w%3AWade%20Brookbank"&gt;Wade Brookbank&lt;/a&gt; in his first goal of the season early in the game to give the Hurricanes their first goal of the game. Florida would answer back when &lt;a href="w%3ABrett%20McLean"&gt;Brett McLean&lt;/a&gt; scored on goalie &lt;a href="w%3ACam%20Ward"&gt;Cam Ward&lt;/a&gt; to tie the game at one goal a piece. The Panthers took their first lead at 8:08 in the second period, when &lt;a href="w%3ARostislav%20Olesz"&gt;Rostislav Olesz&lt;/a&gt; scored his second in two games. &lt;a href="w%3ASergei%20Samsonov"&gt;Sergei Samsonov&lt;/a&gt; evened the score less than two minutes later. Florida would retake the lead before the second period was done with a &lt;a href="w%3ANathan%20Horton"&gt;Nathan Horton&lt;/a&gt; goal. Horton would score his second goal, his 7th goal in the past 7 games, on a penalty shot to put the Panthers up by two goals in the third period, but Carolina scored the lead with three consecutive goals: &lt;a href="w%3AEric%20Staal"&gt;Eric Staal&lt;/a&gt; at 5:35, &lt;a href="w%3ATrevor%20Letowski"&gt;Trevor Letowski&lt;/a&gt; two minutes later, and &lt;a href="w%3ARay%20Whitney%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;Ray Whitney&lt;/a&gt;, the game winner, at 15:39.
<h3>Washington Capitals @ Tampa Bay Lightning</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3ATomas%20Fleischmann"&gt;Tomas Fleischmann&lt;/a&gt; would be assisted by &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Semin"&gt;Alexander Semin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANicklas%20Backstrom"&gt;Nicklas Backstrom&lt;/a&gt; to give the Capitals a 1-0 lead late in the first. After a scoreless 36 minutes of play, &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Steckel"&gt;David Steckel&lt;/a&gt; would score his 5th of the season to put Washington up by 2. Two Tampa Bay goals would even the score, when &lt;a href="w%3AVaclav%20Prospal"&gt;Vaclav Prospal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJan%20Hlavac"&gt;Jan Hlavac&lt;/a&gt; each scored 27 seconds apart. Semin would score the go-ahead goal 36 seconds later to give the Lightning their third loss in a row to the Capitals. Kolzig made 39 out of 41 saves to pick up his 22nd win of the year.
<h3>St. Louis Blues @ Nashville Predators</h3>

The Predators put 44 shots on goal, managing to put two of them past goaltender &lt;a href="w%3AManny%20Legace"&gt;Manny Legace&lt;/a&gt;, which was just enough to pick up a home victory. &lt;a href="w%3AYan%20Stastny"&gt;Yan Stastny&lt;/a&gt; made his Blues debut, and scored the first goal of the game to give them one goal lead late in the first period. They would hold on to it until a &lt;a href="w%3AScott%20Nichol"&gt;Scott Nichol&lt;/a&gt; goal tied the game and sent it into overtime. &lt;a href="w%3AShea%20Weber"&gt;Shea Weber&lt;/a&gt; scored a power play goal at 40 seconds to win it for the Predators.
<h3>Los Angeles Kings @ Phoenix Coyotes</h3>

Coach &lt;a href="w%3AWayne%20Gretzky"&gt;Wayne Gretzky&lt;/a&gt; picked up his 99th win as coach of the Phoenix Coyotes, who were playing Gretzky's former team, the Los Angeles Kings. &lt;a href="w%3AEd%20Jovanovski"&gt;Ed Jovanovski&lt;/a&gt; would score his 10th goal of the season on a first period power play to put the Coyotes on the scoreboard. &lt;a href="w%3ARaitis%20Ivanans"&gt;Raitis Ivanans&lt;/a&gt; would tie the game a few minutes later. &lt;a href="w%3AJoel%20Perrault"&gt;Joel Perrault&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Winnik"&gt;Daniel Winnik&lt;/a&gt; would each score a goal to give Phoenix a two goal advantage. Early in the third period, Los Angeles' a &lt;a href="w%3ADustin%20Brown"&gt;Dustin Brown&lt;/a&gt; power play goal would cut their deficit in half. &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Frolov"&gt;Alexander Frolov&lt;/a&gt; would beat Phoenix goalie &lt;a href="w%3AIlya%20Bryzgalov"&gt;Ilya Bryzgalov&lt;/a&gt; to even the score at three goals a piece. &lt;a href="w%3ARadim%20Vrbata"&gt;Radim Vrbata&lt;/a&gt; would give Phoenix the go-ahead goal, and game winner, at 12:54. &lt;a href="w%3AShane%20Doan"&gt;Shane Doan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANiko%20Kapanen"&gt;Niko Kapanen&lt;/a&gt; would each pick up two assists, Jovanoski would have a three point night, assisting on the Perrault and Vrbata goals.
<h3>Edmonton Oilers @ Vancouver Canucks</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Sedin"&gt;Daniel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AHenrik%20Sedin"&gt;Henrik Sedin&lt;/a&gt; assisted &lt;a href="w%3AMarkus%20Naslund"&gt;Markus Naslund&lt;/a&gt; in scoring first for the Canucks 3:08 into the opening period; Edmonton's &lt;a href="w%3AMarty%20Reasoner"&gt;Marty Reasoner&lt;/a&gt; would even the score later in the period. An early second period power play goal by &lt;a href="w%3ASami%20Salo"&gt;Sami Salo&lt;/a&gt; would retake the lead for Vancouver, but &lt;a href="w%3AKyle%20Brodziak"&gt;Kyle Brodziak&lt;/a&gt; would re-tie the game at 17:14. Daniel Sedin would score his 25th goal of the year, which was assisted by Henrik Sedin and Naslund, at 7:45 in the third period. Henrik would earn his 3rd point in the game by assisting &lt;a href="w%3AAlex%20Burrows"&gt;Alex Burrows&lt;/a&gt; in an empty net goal, which salted the Canucks win.

As part of the &lt;a href="w%3ANBA%20all-star%20weekend"&gt;NBA all-star weekend&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Basketball%20Development%20League"&gt;National Basketball Development League&lt;/a&gt; held its second annual all-star game featuring the stars of the league who hope to receive a break on an NBA team.

The game was held in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Orleans%2C%20Louisiana"&gt;New Orleans, Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; and broadcast on &lt;a href="w%3ANBA%20TV"&gt;NBA TV&lt;/a&gt;. The all-stars made up two teams, a blue team captioned by the winningest coach in NBA history &lt;a href="w%3ALenny%20Wilkins"&gt;Lenny Wilkins&lt;/a&gt; and a red team captioned by former &lt;a href="w%3AGolden%20State%20Warriors"&gt;Golden State Warriors&lt;/a&gt; great and member of the 50 greatest players of all-time, &lt;a href="w%3ARick%20Barry"&gt;Rick Barry&lt;/a&gt;. The blue team won the game by a score of 117-99 over the red team.

After the red team won the first quarter the blue team dominated the rest of the game, led by 22 points from the game’s &lt;a href="w%3AMost%20Valuable%20Player"&gt;Most Valuable Player&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJeremy%20Richardson"&gt;Jeremy Richardson&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AFort%20Wayne%20Mad%20Ants"&gt;Fort Wayne Mad Ants&lt;/a&gt; and formerly of the &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Antonio%20Spurs"&gt;San Antonio Spurs&lt;/a&gt;. The red team was led by 20 points and 10 rebounds from &lt;a href="w%3AElton%20Brown%20%28basketball%29"&gt;Elton Brown&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AColorado%2014ers"&gt;Colorado 14ers&lt;/a&gt;. 

The NBDL is made up of players assigned to teams based on affiliations from the NBA for further development needed to compete. Fifteen percent of all players now in the NBA came from the NBDL.

<h1>Kosovo declares independence from Serbia</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Kosovo%20declares%20independence%20from%20Serbia&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

At 15:00 GMT today, &lt;a href="Kosovo"&gt;Kosovo&lt;/a&gt; announced its independence from &lt;a href="Serbia"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt;. Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AHashim%20Tha%C3%A7i"&gt;Hashim Thaçi&lt;/a&gt; declared that Kosovo would become a democratic country and would respect the rights of all its communities. It is expected that several countries, including the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and most members of the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;, will recognise its independence on Monday. Serbia and &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; are against an independent Kosovo. Approximately 10% of Kosovars are of Serbian descent, the majority is &lt;a href="w%3AAlbania"&gt;Albania&lt;/a&gt;n.

The declaration was passed unanimously by the Kosovar parliament, who subsequently signed it. The Prime Minister told &lt;a href="w%3AMember%20of%20Parliament"&gt;MPs&lt;/a&gt; that "We have waited for this day for a very long time", and that "the independence of Kosovo marks the end of the dissolution of the former Yugoslavia". He also said that Kosovo would be working to follow the plan drawn up by former &lt;a href="Finland"&gt;Finnish&lt;/a&gt; president &lt;a href="w%3AMartti%20Ahtisaari"&gt;Martti Ahtisaari&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;. MPs have also selected a new flag (pictured on the right), showing the shape of the country in gold, on a blue background, with six white stars.

The Serbian Prime Minister, &lt;a href="w%3AVojislav%20Kostunica"&gt;Vojislav Kostunica&lt;/a&gt; said that the declaration made Kosovo a ♡❤"false state"♡❤. Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic had this to say about the declaration: 

He had previously said that if Kosovo were to declare independence, ♡❤"we shall undertake all diplomatic, political and economic measures designed to impede and reverse this direct and unprovoked attack on our sovereignty."♡❤

&lt;br clear="left"&gt;
<h2>International reaction</h2>

The British Foreign Office said that the declaration was "an important development which creates a new context for Kosovo status", and U.S. President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; said that he "strongly supported the Ahtisaari plan", which had resulted in the declaration.

&lt;a href="w%3AJavier%20Solana"&gt;Javier Solana&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;'s co-ordinator of foreign policy said that "stability in Kosovo as well as of the whole Balkan region is essential", and that he is "convinced that the Kosovar leaders will be up to their responsibilities in this crucial moment". &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; foreign minister &lt;a href="w%3ABernard%20Kouchner"&gt;Bernard Kouchner&lt;/a&gt; said that he wished Kosovo good luck.

The Russian Foreign Ministry, however, said that they expected UN and NATO peacekeeping forces to "out their mandate" and take "tough administrative measures" against the declaration. The President of &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Vladimir%20Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt;, has criticised European states that are backing the declaration by pointing out that other separatist groups like &lt;a href="w%3ABasque%20people"&gt;Basques&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; and Turks in &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Cyprus"&gt;Northern Cyprus&lt;/a&gt; are not granted the same support. He has said that supporting Kosovo's announcement ♡❤“...is not moral or legal”♡❤.

The &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; minister of Foreign Affairs, &lt;a href="w%3AMaxime%20Verhagen"&gt;Maxime Verhagen&lt;/a&gt;, said that he wanted to study the constitution and the declaration of independence before supporting the new nation. Belgium Foreign Minister Karel De Gucht also welcomed the Ahtisaari to secure safety and stability in the region.

&lt;a href="w%3AGrameen%20Bank"&gt;Grameen Bank&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Bangladesh"&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt; has made the first loans to &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; citizens who do not have a bank account. Grameen Bank is experienced in micro-financing in its home country, lending money to poor women that want to start small businesses. 

Since the start of the &lt;a href="w%3ASubprime%20mortgage%20crisis"&gt;mortgage-crisis&lt;/a&gt; more people in the U.S. tend to turn to fringe financial institutions bypassing the mainstream bank institutes. "Now is a good time because of ... the subprime crisis and that highlights the issue that the financial system is not perfect," , says the bank's founder and 2006 &lt;a href="w%3ANobel%20Peace%20Prize"&gt;Nobel Peace Prize&lt;/a&gt; winner &lt;a href="w%3AMuhammad%20Yunus"&gt;Muhammad Yunus&lt;/a&gt;. Grameen Bank started in 1976 by lending a total amount of $27.00 to 42 Bangladesh women. To date the bank has made over $6.5 billion in loans to 7 million people in Bangladesh.

Grameen Bank's first loans of approximately $50,000.00 in total in the U.S. was to a group of women in &lt;a href="w%3AJackson%20Heights%2C%20Queens"&gt;Jackson Heights, Queens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;. Garmeen Bank plans to offer $176 million in loans in New York City the next five years, and after that expanding into business as remittances and mortgages all over the U.S., as it has done in Bangladesh.

After a second election on Friday &lt;a href="w%3AV%C3%A1clav%20Klaus"&gt;Václav Klaus&lt;/a&gt;, a center-right conservative, has been re-elected to a five-year term as President of the &lt;a href="Czech%20Republic"&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt;. He was one of three candidates, opposing &lt;a href="w%3AJan%20%C5%A0vejnar"&gt;Jan Švejnar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJana%20Bobo%C5%A1%C3%ADkov%C3%A1"&gt;Jana Bobošíková&lt;/a&gt;. Needing 140 votes, his victory was narrow with 141 votes. 

Klaus' chances to be re-elected were boosted when &lt;a href="w%3ACzech%20Social%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;Czech Social Democratic Party (ČSSD)&lt;/a&gt; senator &lt;a href="w%3AEv%C5%BEen%20Sn%C3%ADtil%C3%BD"&gt;Evžen Snítilý&lt;/a&gt; announced he would vote for Klaus prior to the session. Snítilý had left the voting session in the third round of the first attempt on February 9, and he is reportedly suffering from threats and blackmail. 

Between the debate and the first voting round Bobošíková withdrew her candidacy, citing a lack of support for her.

Two recent polls have shown that the residents of the town of &lt;a href="w%3ABerwick-upon-Tweed"&gt;Berwick-upon-Tweed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; would prefer to live in &lt;a href="Scotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;. 

Located 57 miles from &lt;a href="w%3AEdinburgh"&gt;Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt;, Scotland and over 300 miles from &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, Berwick was a frequent bone of contention in the border wars between the independent kingdoms of England and Scotland, changing hands at least 13 times between 1147 and 1482. Under the &lt;a href="w%3ATreaty%20of%20Perpetual%20Peace%20%281502%29"&gt;Treaty of Perpetual Peace&lt;/a&gt; agreed in 1502 by the English &lt;a href="w%3AHenry%20VII%20of%20England"&gt;King Henry VII&lt;/a&gt; and the Scottish &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20IV%20of%20Scotland"&gt;King James IV&lt;/a&gt;, Berwick was declared to be "of the Kingdom of England but not in it". This resulted in Berwick having to be named individually in legislation until the British Parliament passed the &lt;a href="w%3AWales%20and%20Berwick%20Act%201746"&gt;Wales and Berwick Act&lt;/a&gt; in 1746 which stated that unless specially specified otherwise, the term "England" in laws included Berwick and Wales; in 1853 the declaration of &lt;a href="w%3ACrimean%20War"&gt;war on Russia&lt;/a&gt; specifically mentioned Berwick, but the 1856 &lt;a href="w%3ATreaty%20of%20Paris%20%281856%29"&gt;Treaty of Paris&lt;/a&gt; did not, leading to the urban legend that the town was still at war with Russia until the Mayor signed a peace treaty with a Soviet diplomat in 1966.

Since the creation of the &lt;a href="w%3AScottish%20Parliament"&gt;Scottish Parliament&lt;/a&gt; in 1999, Berwickers have noted that Scottish residents receive about £1500 more government expenditure each year than English residents, including free care for elderly people and free university tuition, both of which have to be paid for in England. 

The town already has a strong Scottish influence - famously both its &lt;a href="w%3AAssociation%20football"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABerwick%20Rangers%20F.C."&gt;team&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARugby%20union"&gt;rugby&lt;/a&gt; team play in the Scottish leagues, a minority of the town's banks are Scottish, and the &lt;a href="w%3AChurch%20of%20Scotland"&gt;Church of Scotland&lt;/a&gt; has a large congregation in the town. 

A poll conducted for the &lt;a href="w%3AITV1"&gt;ITV&lt;/a&gt; television programme, ♡❤Tonight♡❤, to be broadcast on February 18 has shown that 60% (1,182 for, 775 against) of those polled would prefer the town to be in Scotland, while a poll for ♡❤The Berwick Advertiser♡❤ newspaper showed 78% in favour. This has resulted in a motion being proposed by &lt;a href="w%3AScottish%20National%20Party"&gt;Scottish National Party&lt;/a&gt; MSP Christine Grahame, calling on the Scottish Government to negotiate for Berwick's "restoration" to Scotland. A spokesman for &lt;a href="w%3AFirst%20Minister%20of%20Scotland"&gt;Scottish First Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Alex%20Salmond"&gt;Alex Salmond&lt;/a&gt; said "The Scottish Government has no territorial demands on our friends in England. But it's clear most people in Berwick would rather be part of SNP-governed Scotland than Labour-run England."

Speaking in his radio address on Saturday, &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; said that the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; will lose its ability to carry out surveillance against suspected terrorists abroad as &lt;a href="US%20Congress"&gt;the US Congress&lt;/a&gt; did not approve a renewal of the law which allows the US Intelligence agencies to record phone calls without a warrant.

Mr. Bush started by saying that "At the stroke of midnight tonight, a vital intelligence law that is helping protect our nation will expire." Right from the opening of his speech, he made it clear that he believed Congress should have passed the bill. During the speech, Bush also said that he believes "Congress had the power to prevent this [the bill not being renewed] from happening, but chose not to."

In a statement, Senate Majority Leader &lt;a href="Harry%20Reid"&gt;Harry Reid&lt;/a&gt; and House Speaker &lt;a href="Nancy%20Pelosi"&gt;Nancy Pelosi&lt;/a&gt; responded to the speech by saying that "Their [George Bush's] true concern here is not national security." They said that Bush wants "to protect the financial interests of telecommunications companies and avoid judicial scrutiny of their warrantless wiretapping program."

The address comes as George Bush leaves on his trip to Africa, with the address being pre-recorded to allow him to make the visit to Africa.

Bush concluded the speech by stating that he believes "the Senate has shown the way by approving a good, bipartisan bill," and that "the House [of Representatives] must pass that bill as soon as they return to Washington from their latest recess." He added that he believes that "at this moment, somewhere in the world, terrorists are planning a new attack on America." and that "Congress has no higher responsibility than ensuring we have the tools to stop them."

Troubled &lt;a href="U.K."&gt;U.K.&lt;/a&gt; bank &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Rock"&gt;Northern Rock&lt;/a&gt; is to be nationalised, the first such move since the &lt;a href="w%3A1970s"&gt;1970s&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AHM%20Treasury"&gt;The Treasury&lt;/a&gt; made the decision after a long period of uncertainty which began in September 2007 when it was revealed that the bank had approached the &lt;a href="w%3ABank%20of%20England"&gt;Bank of England&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a href="w%3Alender%20of%20last%20resort"&gt;lender of last resort&lt;/a&gt; due to problems raising funds in the money markets.

The move means that bids from &lt;a href="w%3AVirgin%20Group"&gt;Virgin Group&lt;/a&gt; and a proposal for a &lt;a href="w%3Amanagement%20buyout"&gt;management buyout&lt;/a&gt; have been rejected.

Polls have already closed on the &lt;a href="Republic%20of%20Cyprus"&gt;Republic of Cyprus&lt;/a&gt; in a quite important closely fought &lt;a href="w%3Apresidential"&gt;presidential&lt;/a&gt; election. Official results are expected in a few hours, and two exit polls suggest the three leading candidates, current President &lt;a href="w%3ATassos%20Papadopoulos"&gt;Tassos Papadopoulos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADimitris%20Christofias"&gt;Dimitris Christofias&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIoannis%20Kasoulides"&gt;Ioannis Kasoulides&lt;/a&gt; are neck-and-neck. An exit poll on state television (&lt;a href="w%3ARIK"&gt;RIK&lt;/a&gt;) gave each candidate around a third of the vote, with left-wing's &lt;a href="w%3AAKEL"&gt;AKEL&lt;/a&gt; party leader Dimitris Christofias, marginally ahead. However, another exit poll for the TV channel &lt;a href="w%3AMega%20Channel"&gt;Mega&lt;/a&gt; suggested that president Papadopoulos is ahead of the other two candidates.

Mr.Papadopoulos, a lawyer and convervative politician, became President of the &lt;a href="w%3AGreek"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt;-controlled Republic of Cyprus in 2003. He had expressed his strong opposition to the 2004 UN plan for re-unification of the island and urged Greek Cypriots to vote against the plan in a referendum which took place on March 2004. Cypriot voters are calculated to around 570,000 across the south of the island, most of them voting in four major cities, &lt;a href="w%3ANicosia"&gt;Nicosia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALimassol"&gt;Limassol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALarnaca"&gt;Larnaca&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APaphos"&gt;Paphos&lt;/a&gt;.

Cyprus is a divided island since &lt;a href="w%3A1974"&gt;1974&lt;/a&gt;, after the Turkish military invasion in the north. Since then, the island remains divided in two parts, the Greek south Republic of Cyprus and the Turkish north (&lt;a href="w%3ATurkish%20Republic%20of%20Northern%20Cyprus"&gt;Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus&lt;/a&gt;). The Greek-controlled Republic of Cyprus is a member of the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; since 2004 and a member of the &lt;a href="w%3Aeuro%20zone"&gt;euro zone&lt;/a&gt; since January 1, 2008.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Belgian%20Indymedians%20discuss%20participatory%20journalism%20at%20open%20door%20day&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Volunteers and interested people could visit the &lt;a href="Belgium"&gt;Belgian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AIndymedia"&gt;Indymedia&lt;/a&gt; headquarters in &lt;a href="w%3ABrussels"&gt;Brussels&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday during their second open door day. Around 50 people came to hear about the organisation's evolution during 2007 and what's coming up for 2008. A book about &lt;a href="w%3Acitizen%20journalism"&gt;citizen journalism&lt;/a&gt;, with contributions from both mainstream journalists and several alternative media experts, was also presented. And the Indymedians mingled, with loungy &lt;a href="w%3ACreative%20Commons"&gt;Creative Commons&lt;/a&gt; music in the background.

Indymedia.be was founded in 2000, only a few months after Indymedia's inception at the &lt;a href="w%3Aalter-globalism"&gt;alter-globalist&lt;/a&gt; protests at the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Trade%20Organisation"&gt;World Trade Organisation&lt;/a&gt;'s summit in &lt;a href="w%3ASeattle"&gt;Seattle&lt;/a&gt;. This made them the first Indymedia on the European mainland. The ♡❤Independent Media Center♡❤♡s trademark is politically left, social reporting. The initial growth was slow, but during 2007, the organisation grew to around 110 regular contributors, with the first steps towards regional groups in Brussels and &lt;a href="w%3AAntwerp"&gt;Antwerp&lt;/a&gt;. The public today could also visit the brand new media centre with new equipment. And although readership has increased exponentially to around 7000 visitors per day (and with it, server costs), finances have not, leading to a fund raising campaign.

Several projects during 2007 aimed to increase the quality of the articles; research projects such as those on the &lt;a href="w%3ABelgian%20general%20election%2C%202007"&gt;Belgian elections&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Belgium%20still%20without%20government%2C%20new%20record%20set"&gt;formation crisis&lt;/a&gt; centred on social issues, where the mainstream media itself recognised that the political debate was often monotonous and lacking content.

Nevertheless, bringing analysis and background will continue a challenge during 2008. During the photographer's workshop, the possibilities for photo documentary and photo-based interviews vs. simple photo reporting were illustrated as an alternative to bringing "just a bunch of pictures from another street protest."

As a central player in the field of alternative media in Belgium, Indymedia also wants to stir the debate about participatory journalism. This has led to their first 'media reader' about the topic, and the creators hope more versions will follow.

<h2>Participation: a key concept for the 'new' media</h2>

The author of the book's introduction, Nico Carpentier, gave a lecture on participatory journalism and the challenges facing organisations like Indymedia. Carpentier is a researcher who teaches media studies at the &lt;a href="w%3AFree%20University%20of%20Brussels"&gt;Free University of Brussels&lt;/a&gt;, and has co-authored the book ♡❤Understanding Alternative Media♡❤ (Open University Press, 2007).

Carpentier started his talk by putting citizen journalism in its &lt;a href="w%3Aweb%202.0"&gt;web 2.0&lt;/a&gt; context to explain some common critiques. He referred to the central position of the individual, who can use blogs to disseminate any personal thought, as 'net narcissism'. Symptomatic of this trend is the shift from the classic media 'organisation' to 'communities' of citizen journalists, noted Carpentier.

He also warned against a reductionist view of 'participation', and used &lt;a href="YouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; to illustrate the lack of influence, shared ownership and responsibility contributors have in the dominant model of so-called participation -instead of creating media together, participation becomes 'posting something'.

He systematically used the term ♡❤participatory journalism♡❤, because he feels the term ♡❤citizen journalism♡❤ is loaded with the problematic image of the amateur journalist, and the idea that '&lt;a href="w%3AOhmyNews"&gt;Every Citizen is a Reporter&lt;/a&gt;'. Journalist Walter Zinzen argues fiercly in Indymedia's new book against would-be journalists who lack the skills that take traditional journalists years of training and experience.

Carpentier elaborated on the pitfalls for participatory journalism initiatives. Such as the balance between participation and efficacy; or how the horizontal structure tends to slow down journalistic 'communities', and more so the larger they get. There is also the general lack of interest in a two-way communication system about the news, in a world where media products are consumer goods. And of course, continuous financial and organisational problems. Carpentier explained how working in the alternative media is rarely a life-threatening hobby in the Western world, but that a lack of government support is still a logical consequence of being a forum for criticism. Some alternative media manage to find alternative funding, while others have to adapt to meet government targets or are taken over by corporations.

Carpentier concluded his lecture calling for more a network of alternative media which could foster collaboration with the mainstream media, based on mutual respect.

In a press release today, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href="w%3AHallmark/Westland%20Meat%20Packing%20Company"&gt;Hallmark/Westland Meat Packing Co.&lt;/a&gt; indicated that it has voluntarily recalled just over 143 million pounds (65 million kilograms) of raw and frozen beef products, which is considered to be the largest single recall of beef products in &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; history. The move follows an investigation by the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Agriculture"&gt;United States Department of Agriculture&lt;/a&gt; (USDA) into allegations of animal cruelty and mishandling of cattle destined for the human food chain.

The USDA's &lt;a href="w%3AFood%20Safety%20and%20Inspection%20Service"&gt;Food Safety and Inspection Service&lt;/a&gt; (FSIS) had determined that beef products produced by the &lt;a href="w%3AChino%2C%20California"&gt;Chino&lt;/a&gt;, California company were unfit for human consumption as the cattle had not received "complete and proper inspection."

The recall has been designated as Class II, which the USDA describes as "a health hazard situation where there is a remote probability of adverse health consequences from the use of the product."

On Friday, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Agriculture"&gt;Secretary of Agriculture&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AEd%20Schafer"&gt;Ed Schafer&lt;/a&gt; indicated that charges had been laid against employees of the plant alleged to have taken part in the mistreatment of cattle. "Today [Friday], the &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Bernardino%20County%2C%20California"&gt;San Bernardino&lt;/a&gt; District Attorney filed felony animal cruelty charges against two employees who were terminated by Hallmark/Westland Meat Packing Company," said Schafer. "It is regrettable that these animals were mistreated and I am encouraged and supportive of these actions by the San Bernardino District Attorney in response to this mistreatment."

The USDA learned of the possible inhumane handling of non-ambulatory (disabled) cattle at the packing plant on January 30 and has since suspended activities at the plant. "We continue to conduct a thorough investigation into whether any violations of food safety or additional humane handling regulations have occurred," said Secretary Schafer in a press release. "On February 8, our Office of the Inspector General took the lead on the investigation. At that time, USDA extended the administrative hold on Hallmark/Westland Meat Packing Company products for the National School Lunch Program, the Emergency Food Assistance Program and the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations while the investigation continues," said Schafer.

The FSIS reported that Hallmark/Westland had not contacted the FSIS public health veterinarian, as required, when cattle became ill or disabled after undergoing ante-mortem (slaughter) inspection, putting the company out of compliance with FSIS regulations. "Because the cattle did not receive complete and proper inspection FSIS has determined them to be unfit for human food and the company is conducting a recall," explained Secretary Schafer. 

The cruelty charges stem from an undercover video that reportedly showed sick cattle being moved by crews using forklifts.

"Words cannot accurately express how shocked and horrified I was at the depictions contained on the video that was taken by an individual who worked at our facility from October 3 thru November 14, 2007," said Steve Mendell, President, Westland Meat Co. and Hallmark Meat Packing. "We have taken swift action regarding the two employees identified on the video and have already implemented aggressive measures to ensure all employees follow our humane handling policies and procedures. We are also cooperating with the USDA investigators on the allegations of inhumane handling treatment which is a serious breech of our company’s policies and training."

The USDA stressed that it is "extremely unlikely" that the cattle involved were at risk for &lt;a href="w%3ABovine%20spongiform%20encephalopathy"&gt;Bovine spongiform encephalopathy&lt;/a&gt; (BSE) or mad-cow disease due to the employment of multiple safeguards. The USDA felt the recall was required, however, as the plant had allegedly violated USDA regulations.

The recall involves raw and frozen beef products produced on various dates from February 1, 2006 to February 2, 2008. For further information about the recall, consumers, media, and distributors are encouraged to contact Hallmark/Westland's Plant Manager Stan Mendell or Food Safety Consultant Steve Sayer at (909) 590-3340 or the FSIS website, www.fsis.usda.gov.

<h1>'Wikileaks.org' taken offline in many areas after fire, court injunction</h1>

The website &lt;a href="w%3AWikileaks"&gt;WikiLeaks.org&lt;/a&gt; has been taken off line in many parts of the world. Wikileaks is a website dedicated to leaking documents that are "anonymous, untraceable, uncensorable."

Several factors have taken the site off line including &lt;a href="w%3ADDoS"&gt;DDoS&lt;/a&gt; attacks, which was followed by a fire which took out the main servers hosting the site in &lt;a href="Sweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;, and a restraining order on the domain name 'WikiLeaks.org' issued in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.

According to the website ♡❤HongPong.com♡❤, ♡❤Wikileaks♡❤ experienced "a 500Mbps distributed denial of service attack" before the fire, but it is not known if the DDoS attack is connected to it.

After the attack, a fire was reported in the &lt;a href="w%3AUninterruptible%20power%20supply"&gt;Uninterruptible Power Supply&lt;/a&gt; of the servers which host the site.

The third and final factor taking the site off line is a permanent injunction granted in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Northern%20District%20of%20California"&gt;California Northern District Court&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco%2C%20California"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; to Bank Julius Baer, a Swiss Bank, which has caused the domain to be taken off line in the U.S.. Wikileaks previously published hundreds of documents obtained from a whistleblower of the Swiss Bank, "purportedly showing offshore tax evasion and money laundering by extremely wealthy and in some cases, politically sensitive, clients from the US, &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Peru"&gt;Peru&lt;/a&gt;."

According to a ♡❤Wikileaks♡❤ press release received by e-mail, the injunction issued by the court states, "Dynadot [Wikileaks host] shall immediately clear and remove all DNS hosting records for the wikileaks.org domain name and prevent the domain name from resolving to the wikileaks.org website or any other website or server other than a blank park page, until further order of this Court."

"The order was entirely written by Cayman Island's Bank Julius Baer lawyers and was accepted by judge White without amendment, or representations by Wikileaks or amicus. The case is over several Wikileaks articles, public commentary and documents dating prior to 2003. The documents allegedly reveal secret Julius Baer trust structures used for asset hiding, money laundering and tax evasion.
The bank alleges the documents were disclosed to Wikileaks by offshore banking whistleblower and former Vice President of the Cayman Island's operation, Rudolf Elmer. Unable to lawfully attack Wikileaks servers which are based in several countries, the order was served on Wikileaks's California registrar Dynadot ("the power company"). The order also enjoins every person who has heard about the order from even linking to the documents," said ♡❤Wikileaks♡❤ in the release.

Despite the injunction, ♡❤Wikileaks♡❤ states that they will "keep on publishing, in-fact, given the level of suppression involved in this case, Wikileaks will step up publication of documents pertaining to illegal or unethical banking practices."

Despite the injunction, the site can still be accessed at http://88.80.13.160/wiki/Wikileaks.

There were 8 games played in the National Hockey League on February 17, 2008, including the top two teams in the West, the Detroit Red Wings and the Dallas Stars, going head to head.

<h2>Game summaries</h2>

<h3>Colorado Avalanche @ Chicago Blackhawks</h3>

Chicago scored first with a &lt;a href="w%3ADustin%20Byfuglien"&gt;Dustin Byfuglien&lt;/a&gt; goal 4:48 into the first period. &lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20Havlat"&gt;Martin Havlat&lt;/a&gt; would put the Blackhawks up early in the second period. A late game goal by Colorado would ruin the shutout for Chicago goaltender &lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Lalime"&gt;Patrick Lalime&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href="w%3AJaroslav%20Hlinka"&gt;Jaroslav Hlinka&lt;/a&gt; managed to beat Lalime at 17:35 in the third period. Lalime, who stopped 21 of 22 shots, picked up a win, his 11th of the season. Chicago picked up their third straight victory; Colorado picked up their third straight loss.
<h3>San Jose Sharks @ New York Rangers</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3AJonathan%20Cheechoo"&gt;Jonathan Cheechoo&lt;/a&gt; scored first for the Sharks to give them an early 1-0 lead. &lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Callahan"&gt;Ryan Callahan&lt;/a&gt; would tie the score at 11:34 in the first period to tie the score. &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Drury"&gt;Chris Drury&lt;/a&gt; would score a goal on a Rangers power play to put New York up by 1 in the second period. Callahan would score his second goal of the game by shooting a puck into an empty net with two seconds left in the third period.
<h3>Detroit Red Wings @ Dallas Stars</h3>

Who would've thought that two teams, who have combined to score 375 goals this season, would only manage one in this game? &lt;a href="w%3ANiklas%20Hagman"&gt;Niklas Hagman&lt;/a&gt; beat Detroit goaltender &lt;a href="w%3AJimmy%20Howard"&gt;Jimmy Howard&lt;/a&gt; to break the scoreless tie 3:13 into the third period. That would be the only goal in the game, as Dallas, who have now won nine of their last ten games, give Detroit their sixth straight loss. Stars goalie &lt;a href="w%3AMarty%20Turco"&gt;Marty Turco&lt;/a&gt; picked up the shutout after stopping 28 shots.
<h3>Columbus Blue Jackets @ St. Louis Blues</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3AMatt%20Walker%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;Matt Walker&lt;/a&gt; scored his first career NHL goal to put the Blues ahead in the first period. Columbus' &lt;a href="w%3ARick%20Nash"&gt;Rick Nash&lt;/a&gt; would score his 31st goal of the season short handed to tie the score at 1 goal a piece. &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Perron"&gt;David Perron&lt;/a&gt; put St. Louis back in the lead early in the second period. Then, &lt;a href="w%3ABrad%20Boyes"&gt;Brad Boyes&lt;/a&gt; scored on the power play to give St. Louis a two goal advantage. &lt;a href="w%3AAndy%20McDonald"&gt;Andy McDonald&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AKeith%20Tkachuk"&gt;Keith Tkachuk&lt;/a&gt; each scored a power play goal to extend St. Louis' lead by 3. &lt;a href="w%3AManny%20Legace"&gt;Manny Legace&lt;/a&gt; made 19 saves, and picked up an assist in the McDonald goal, in his 22nd win of the year. &lt;a href="w%3AEric%20Brewer%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;Eric Brewer&lt;/a&gt; had four assists, &lt;a href="w%3AErik%20Johnson"&gt;Erik Johnson&lt;/a&gt; had 2, and the Blues tied the season series with Columbus at three games each.
<h3>Pittsburgh Penguins @ Buffalo Sabres</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3AJarkko%20Ruutu"&gt;Jarkko Ruutu&lt;/a&gt; broke the scoreless tie at 7:28 in the second period to put Pittsburgh on the board first. &lt;a href="w%3APetr%20Sykora"&gt;Petr Sykora&lt;/a&gt; would score two minutes later on a power play to put the Penguins up by 2 goals. Buffalo's only goal would come from &lt;a href="w%3AThomas%20Vanek"&gt;Thomas Vanek&lt;/a&gt; at 14:45 in the second period to cut Pittsburgh's lead in half. &lt;a href="w%3AEvgeni%20Malkin"&gt;Evgeni Malkin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AColby%20Armstrong"&gt;Colby Armstrong&lt;/a&gt; each scored in the third period, and the Penguins took their third victory against the Sabres this season. Penguin goaltender &lt;a href="w%3ATy%20Conklin"&gt;Ty Conklin&lt;/a&gt; stopped 36 shots, and earned his 15th win of the season.
<h3>Montreal Canadiens @ Philadelphia Flyers</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Kovalev"&gt;Alexander Kovalev&lt;/a&gt; scored first for the Canadiens to give them the lead 6:18 into the game. &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Richards"&gt;Mike Richards&lt;/a&gt; would put the Flyers on the board on a short handed goal at 9:30 in the first. &lt;a href="w%3AFrancis%20Bouillon"&gt;Francis Bouillon&lt;/a&gt; put Montreal in the lead with two seconds left in the first period. Philadelphia would tie the game at two goals a piece early in the second period when &lt;a href="w%3ABraydon%20Coburn"&gt;Braydon Coburn&lt;/a&gt; scored his 5th goal of the season. &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Ryder"&gt;Michael Ryder&lt;/a&gt; would re-take the lead for Montreal when he scored less than two minutes later. &lt;a href="w%3ASaku%20Koivu"&gt;Saku Koivu&lt;/a&gt; would extend the Canadiens' lead to 2 on a power-play goal just past the halfway point of the game. &lt;a href="w%3AMaxim%20Lapierre"&gt;Maxim Lapierre&lt;/a&gt; would score a goal on an empty net at 18:36 in the third period. &lt;a href="w%3ARiley%20Cote"&gt;Riley Cote&lt;/a&gt; would add a Philadelphia goal about a minute later, but the damage was already done, as the Montreal Canadiens took their third straight victory and handed Philly their seventh straight loss.
<h3>Calgary Flames @ Anaheim Ducks</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3ADaymond%20Langkow"&gt;Daymond Langkow&lt;/a&gt; would give the Flames their only lead of the game at 15:10 in the first period on a power play goal. &lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Getzlaf"&gt;Ryan Getzlaf&lt;/a&gt; would score in the opening minute of the second period to tie the game. &lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Carter"&gt;Ryan Carter&lt;/a&gt; would give the Ducks their first lead of the game 4:26 into the second period. That was followed by power play goals by &lt;a href="w%3AScott%20Niedermayer"&gt;Scott Niedermayer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Pronger"&gt;Chris Pronger&lt;/a&gt; to give Anaheim a 3 goal lead by the end of the second period. &lt;a href="w%3AWayne%20Primeau"&gt;Wayne Primeau&lt;/a&gt; would cut the Flames' deficit to two goals at 1:54 into the third period. Anaheim's two goal lead would hold as they pick up the victory at home. &lt;a href="w%3ATeemu%20Selanne"&gt;Teemu Selanne&lt;/a&gt; assisted in the Carter goal, his 670th point as a Duck, and his fourth point since returning to the Ducks on February 5. &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Kunitz"&gt;Chris Kunitz&lt;/a&gt; picked up a pair of assists, and Getzlaf had two points, assisting on Niedermeyer's game winning goal.
<h3>Nashville Predators @ Minnesota Wild</h3>

A goal by &lt;a href="w%3AJerred%20Smithson"&gt;Jerred Smithson&lt;/a&gt; put the Predators on the board early, his 5th goal of the season. &lt;a href="w%3APetteri%20Nummelin"&gt;Petteri Nummelin&lt;/a&gt; would put the Wild on the scoreboard just past the half-way point of the first period on a break-away, assisted by &lt;a href="w%3AEric%20Belanger"&gt;Eric Belanger&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Parrish"&gt;Mark Parrish&lt;/a&gt; would give Minnesota their first lead of the game with 23 seconds left in the opening period. &lt;a href="w%3APierre-Marc%20Bouchard"&gt;Pierre-Marc Bouchard&lt;/a&gt; would add to the Wild lead at 14:19 in the second period with a power play goal. &lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20Erat"&gt;Martin Erat&lt;/a&gt; would cut the Wild's lead in half at 4:05 in the third, but &lt;a href="w%3AMarian%20Gaborik"&gt;Marian Gaborik&lt;/a&gt; would score his 31st goal of the season on a delayed penalty to put the Wild back ahead by two moments later. Nashville would tie the game when &lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Suter"&gt;Ryan Suter&lt;/a&gt; scored at 8:54 in the third period, and &lt;a href="w%3AShea%20Weber"&gt;Shea Weber&lt;/a&gt; scored on a Predator power play at 14:05. No goals would be scored through the rest of regulation, so the game was sent into overtime. &lt;a href="w%3APavol%20Demitra"&gt;Pavol Demitra&lt;/a&gt; passed across to Gaborik, who beat Nashville goalie &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Mason"&gt;Chris Mason&lt;/a&gt;, to win it for the Wild with 4 seconds left in the 4-on-4 overtime. Gaborik had a three point night, with two goals and an assist on the Parrish goal.
<h2>Other news</h2>

The Blue Jackets activated &lt;a href="w%3ASergei%20Fedorov"&gt;Sergei Fedorov&lt;/a&gt; from injured reserve. Fedorov missed 13 games due to a concussion he suffered on January 17 in a game against the Phoenix Coyotes.

The Rangers signed defenseman &lt;a href="w%3AFedor%20Tyutin"&gt;Fedor Tyutin&lt;/a&gt; to a contract extension. Tyutin, who was drafted by the Rangers in 2001, has played in 228 games with New York, scored 14 goals, and assisted in 46. The Rangers have also inked contract extensions for defenseman &lt;a href="w%3ADan%20Girardi"&gt;Dan Girardi&lt;/a&gt; and goaltender &lt;a href="w%3AHenrik%20Lundqvist"&gt;Henrik Lundqvist&lt;/a&gt; this week.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
Part of the facade at the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AKarpeles%20Manuscript%20Library%20Museum"&gt;Karpeles Manuscript Library Museum&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ located at 220 North Street in Buffalo has crumbled causing bricks to fall into Elmwood Avenue.

At approximately 11:20 p.m. (&lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Time%20Zone"&gt;eastern time&lt;/a&gt;) on Sunday night February 17, a call was placed into &lt;a href="w%3A9-1-1"&gt;911&lt;/a&gt; stating that bricks from a wall, a nearly 150 foot section of the upper facade, were lying in the middle of Elmwood after falling off the building. The fire department had to shut down Elmwood from North Street to Allen at 11:30 p.m. until further notice due to the debris and risk to public safety.

No one was injured in the incident, but at least one parked car was damaged by falling bricks.

Though no weather warnings have been issued for the City, winds with gusts up to 50 miles per hour have been reported through the night. It is not known if the wind played a factor in the damage to the building.

City engineers were on scene discussing how to handle the situation and clean up what has already fallen.

The museum is the world's largest collection of documents which are owned privately. The Buffalo building was originally a Church of Christ built in 1911.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Eastern%20Conference%20wins%202008%20NBA%20All-Star%20Game&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Conference%20%28NBA%29"&gt;Eastern Conference&lt;/a&gt; defeated their &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20Conference%20%28NBA%29"&gt;Western Conference&lt;/a&gt; counterparts at the &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20National%20Basketball%20Association%20All-Star%20Game"&gt;2008 National Basketball Association All-Star Game&lt;/a&gt; held at &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Orleans%20Arena"&gt;New Orleans Arena&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Orleans%2C%20Louisiana"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Louisiana"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday. The final score was 134-128. 

The East took an early 11 point lead in the first 5 minutes, due to an injured &lt;a href="w%3AKobe%20Bryant"&gt;Kobe Bryant&lt;/a&gt; only playing 2 minutes before sitting on the bench for the rest of the game. "There's one player we really, really missed, and that was Kobe," said West coach &lt;a href="w%3AByron%20Scott"&gt;Byron Scott&lt;/a&gt;. The West later reduced the lead to 2 points, but at halftime, the East led 74-65.

The West trailed by 13 at the beginning of the fourth quarter, but rallied behind &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Orleans%20Hornets"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt; point guard &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Paul"&gt;Chris Paul&lt;/a&gt;, who had seven assists in the final period. With 2:48 remaining, &lt;a href="w%3ABrandon%20Roy"&gt;Brandon Roy&lt;/a&gt; scored a layup on an assist from Paul, giving the West a 122-119 lead, their biggest lead of the game.

The East then answered back with two three-pointers from &lt;a href="w%3ARay%20Allen"&gt;Ray Allen&lt;/a&gt;, before Chris Paul tied the game with a three-pointer of his own. However, the East would then take the lead and the game with layups from &lt;a href="w%3ADwyane%20Wade"&gt;Dwyane Wade&lt;/a&gt; and Allen, as well as a driving dunk from &lt;a href="w%3ALeBron%20James"&gt;LeBron James&lt;/a&gt;. A Brandon Roy three-pointer put the game within three points with 8.7 seconds left, but 3 free throws from Ray Allen sealed the win for the East.

"The fourth quarter was crazy," said Chris Paul. "We were down 13. We picked up the intensity. We took the lead a few times but Ray Allen was unbelievable the way he shot the ball. And that last dunk by LeBron, we had two people on him but that still wasn't enough."

With 27 points, 8 rebounds, and 9 assists, James was named the All-Star Game's &lt;a href="w%3ANBA%20All-Star%20MVP"&gt;Most Valuable Player&lt;/a&gt; for the second time in his career. Some television commentators also considered Ray Allen a likely choice for the award, with 14 of his 28 points coming in the final 3 minutes of the game. "I think Ray Allen had a heck of a shooting night," James said after being presented the award.

<h2>Other All-Star events</h2>
Although the All-Star game itself is the highlight of the All-Star festivities, the weekend would not be complete without the league's best players showing their skills in other events, including the &lt;a href="w%3ARookie%20Challenge"&gt;Rookie Challenge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AThree-Point%20Shootout"&gt;Three-Point Shootout&lt;/a&gt;, and the fan-favorite &lt;a href="w%3ASlam%20Dunk%20Contest"&gt;Slam Dunk Contest&lt;/a&gt;.

<h3>T-Mobile Rookie Challenge</h3>
The Sophomores defeated the Rookies 136-109 in this game featuring the best young players in the league. &lt;a href="w%3ACleveland%20Cavaliers"&gt;Cleveland Cavaliers&lt;/a&gt; guard &lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Gibson"&gt;Daniel Gibson&lt;/a&gt; was named the game's MVP, with all 33 of his points coming from 3 point shots. He broke &lt;a href="w%3AKyle%20Korver"&gt;Kyle Korver&lt;/a&gt;'s Rookie Challenge record of seven three-pointers, set in 2005. This was the sixth straight victory for the Sophomores.
<h3>Haier Shooting Stars Competition</h3>
Team &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Antonio"&gt;San Antonio&lt;/a&gt; won this shooting competition featuring current and former &lt;a href="w%3ANBA"&gt;NBA&lt;/a&gt; stars, as well as &lt;a href="w%3AWNBA"&gt;WNBA&lt;/a&gt; players. Team San Antonio, which consisted of &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Antonio%20Spurs"&gt;Spurs&lt;/a&gt; forward &lt;a href="w%3ATim%20Duncan"&gt;Tim Duncan&lt;/a&gt;, former Spurs center &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Robinson"&gt;David Robinson&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Antonio%20Silver%20Stars"&gt;Silver Stars&lt;/a&gt; guard &lt;a href="w%3ABecky%20Hammon"&gt;Becky Hammon&lt;/a&gt;, defeated Team &lt;a href="w%3AChicago"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt; in the finals on a halfcourt shot by Duncan.

<h3>Playstation Skills Challenge</h3>
&lt;a href="w%3ADeron%20Williams"&gt;Deron Williams&lt;/a&gt; passed, shot, and dribbled his way through the obstacle course to win the Playstation Skills Challenge with a record time of 25.5 seconds in the final round. &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Paul"&gt;Chris Paul&lt;/a&gt;'s time of 31.2 seconds was strong, but no match for Williams' performance. Dwyane Wade, who had won the challenge for the past two years in a row, struggled through the first round with a time of 53.9 seconds. Also eliminated in the first round was &lt;a href="w%3AJason%20Kidd"&gt;Jason Kidd&lt;/a&gt;, who finished the course in 39.7 seconds.
<h3>Foot Locker Three-Point Shootout</h3>
&lt;a href="w%3AToronto%20Raptors"&gt;Toronto Raptors&lt;/a&gt; guard &lt;a href="w%3AJason%20Kapono"&gt;Jason Kapono&lt;/a&gt; won the shootout for the second year in row, making him the first back-to-back winner since &lt;a href="w%3APeja%20Stojakovic"&gt;Peja Stojakovic&lt;/a&gt; won in 2002 and 2003. Kapono's final round score of 25 tied the record set by &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Price"&gt;Mark Price&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACraig%20Hodges"&gt;Craig Hodges&lt;/a&gt; in the 1986 competition. Also in the final round were Daniel Gibson, who scored 17 points in the final round, and &lt;a href="w%3ADirk%20Nowitzki"&gt;Dirk Nowitzki&lt;/a&gt;, the 2006 Shootout champion, who scored 14. Eliminated in the first round were Stojakovic, &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Hamilton"&gt;Richard Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Nash"&gt;Steve Nash&lt;/a&gt;.

<h3>Sprite Slam Dunk Contest</h3>
"I don't think people want to see the same old dunks. They want to see something else, see some spice." 

These were &lt;a href="w%3ADwight%20Howard"&gt;Dwight Howard&lt;/a&gt;'s words after winning the Slam Dunk Contest on Saturday. In the first year where fans were able to vote for the winner through &lt;a href="w%3Atext%20messaging"&gt;text messaging&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AInternet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt;, Howard received 78% of the vote, beating out &lt;a href="w%3AGerald%20Green"&gt;Gerald Green&lt;/a&gt; for the slam dunk trophy.

In one of the more notable dunks of the contest, Howard donned a &lt;a href="w%3ASuperman"&gt;Superman&lt;/a&gt; costume, complete with a red cape. He then took off from just inside the free throw line and threw the ball down without even touching the rim. In Howard's first dunk of the night, he tossed the ball off the reverse side of the backboard, caught it, and dunked left-handed.

Gerald Green impressed the fans and the judges when his teammate &lt;a href="w%3ARashad%20McCants"&gt;Rashad McCants&lt;/a&gt; placed a cupcake with a lit candle on the back of the rim; Green then jumped up, blew out the candle, and threw down a left handed dunk.

"At first I thought he was going to take the cupcake, eat it and then dunk it," said Howard. "I thought he would have won with that."

<h2>New offensive against Taliban in Orūzgān</h2>
The &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt; army started, in co-operation with &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghan&lt;/a&gt; soldiers a new &lt;a href="w%3Aoffensive%20%28military%29"&gt;offensive&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href="w%3ATaliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AOr%C5%ABzg%C4%81n%20Province"&gt;Orūzgān province&lt;/a&gt; of Afghanistan. The Dutch hope to secure safety and security in the area of &lt;a href="w%3ADeh%20Rawood"&gt;Deh Rawood&lt;/a&gt;, says a spokesman of the Dutch ministry of Defence. Enemy troops have gained strength in the area. "Because of this, the rebuilding was slowed down, and the local population were under bigger pressure," the spokesman says.

<h2>Women think about sex too</h2>

Women think about sex just as often as men, says &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; dating-site "Dating Direct". Common perception is that men are more occupied with sex than women, but women think about sex 34 times a day, which is every 14th minute. 

Dating Direct performed a survey on 1,000 women asking, questions about their sexlife. Almost 50% of them are not satisfied, making them think of sex more, especially when they are at work.

&lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle"&gt;Space Shuttle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Atlantis"&gt;♡❤Atlantis♡❤&lt;/a&gt; today undocked from the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Space%20Station"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt;, beginning its return to Earth. The Shuttle, which had been visiting the station for mission &lt;a href="w%3ASTS-122"&gt;STS-122&lt;/a&gt;, delivering the &lt;a href="w%3AColumbus%20module"&gt;♡❤Columbus♡❤ laboratory&lt;/a&gt; to the orbital outpost. Undocking occurred at 09:24 GMT, after connecting hatches between the spacecraft were closed at 18:03 GMT yesterday evening.

♡❤Atlantis♡❤ is scheduled to land on Wednesday. While NASA hope that it can land at the &lt;a href="w%3AKennedy%20Space%20Center"&gt;Kennedy Space Center&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AShuttle%20Landing%20Facility"&gt;Shuttle Landing Facility&lt;/a&gt; (SLF), they are prepared to use their backup site at &lt;a href="w%3AEdwards%20Air%20Force%20Base"&gt;Edwards Air Force Base&lt;/a&gt;, should the conditions at the SLF be unacceptable for landing. The backup site is not usually considered for the first landing attempt, but is being considered an option for STS-122 because of the US Navy's intention to &lt;a href="US%20military%20to%20shoot%20down%20errant%20spy%20satellite"&gt;destroy a failed spy satellite in orbit&lt;/a&gt;. This is expected to create debris, which could potentially damage spacecraft passing through the orbit that the spy satellite is in, such as a re-entering Shuttle.
During STS-122, the ♡❤Columbus♡❤ module was added to the ISS, and a nitrogen coolant tank was replaced. ♡❤Atlantis♡❤ also collected a failed control gyroscope from the station, which had been replaced during the earlier &lt;a href="w%3ASTS-118"&gt;STS-118&lt;/a&gt; mission. A crew rotation also occurred, with &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; astronaut &lt;a href="w%3AL%C3%A9opold%20Eyharts"&gt;Léopold Eyharts&lt;/a&gt; replacing &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20M.%20Tani"&gt;Daniel M. Tani&lt;/a&gt; as a member of the Station's &lt;a href="w%3AExpedition%2016"&gt;Expedition 16&lt;/a&gt; crew.

Meanwhile, &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Endeavour"&gt;♡❤Endeavour♡❤&lt;/a&gt;, which is scheduled to fly the next Shuttle Mission, has been moved to the launch pad. The fully-stacked Shuttle and &lt;a href="w%3AMobile%20Launch%20Platform"&gt;Mobile Launch Platform&lt;/a&gt; rolled out of the Kennedy Space Center's &lt;a href="w%3AVehicle%20Assembly%20Building"&gt;Vehicle Assembly Building&lt;/a&gt; at 04:26 GMT, and is made its way down the &lt;a href="w%3ACrawlerway"&gt;Crawlerway&lt;/a&gt;, arriving at &lt;a href="w%3AKennedy%20Space%20Center%20Launch%20Complex%2039"&gt;Launch Complex 39A&lt;/a&gt; at about 09:45 GMT, and had been secured in place by 11:22. The &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Air%20Force"&gt;US Air Force&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Air%20Force%20Thunderbirds"&gt;♡❤Thunderbirds♡❤ display team&lt;/a&gt; performed a flyby of the Shuttle at 15:15 GMT. ♡❤Endeavour♡❤ is scheduled to begin the &lt;a href="w%3ASTS-123"&gt;STS-123&lt;/a&gt; mission in early-mid March, with a component for the &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;ese &lt;a href="w%3AJapanese%20Experiment%20Module"&gt;Experiment Module&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASpecial%20Purpose%20Dexterous%20Manipulator"&gt;♡❤Dextre♡❤&lt;/a&gt; component for the Space Station's robotic arm.

At the &lt;a href="2008%20Taipei%20International%20Book%20Exhibition"&gt;2008 Taipei International Book Exhibition&lt;/a&gt;, comic books and fiction books presented different authoring styles in formatting, story construction, and background settings. Examples of these were highlighted at two seminars entitled "On Trends in Creative &lt;a href="w%3AChinese%20language"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; Literature" and "From '&lt;i&gt;Shao Nu Xiao Yu&lt;/i&gt;' (少女小漁, meaning in &lt;a href="w%3AEnglish%20language"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; as "A Young Girl - Little Fish") to '&lt;i&gt;The Banquet Bug&lt;/i&gt;' (赴宴者)", as well as through recent fiction released by several publishers in &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;.

In the seminar about 'The Banquet Bug', a book, which has drawn by international media attention from ♡❤"&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Times"&gt;The Times&lt;/a&gt;"♡❤, ♡❤"&lt;a href="w%3ADaily%20Mail"&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/a&gt;"♡❤, and ♡❤"&lt;a href="w%3ATime%20%28magazine%29"&gt;TIME Magazine&lt;/a&gt;"♡❤, was recently translated into the Chinese language by John Chiang-sheng Kuo (郭強生). Taiwanese literature commentator Nan Fang Shou (南方朔, pen-name by Xin-ching Wang, 王杏慶) said the following at the seminar:

At the other seminar, "On Trends in Creative Chinese Literature", which focused on &lt;a href="w%3Awuxia"&gt;wuxia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Anovel"&gt;novels&lt;/a&gt;, famous Taiwanese novelist Da-chuen Chang (張大春) commented with some specialists on wuxia novels and said:
In fact, the novel and fiction authoring in Taiwan has generally been steady and varied with such examples and the maturation of independent authoring.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Kosovo%20seeks%20recognition%20as%20independent%20state&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A day after declaring independence from &lt;a href="Serbia"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Kosovo"&gt;Kosovo&lt;/a&gt; is hoping for recognition from the global community, especially the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.

"We expect to be recognized by the first countries any minute," said Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AHashim%20Thaci"&gt;Hashim Thaci&lt;/a&gt; to his cabinet. Most of the EU's 27-member nations are expected to recognize Kosovo. The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; is prepared to recognize Kosovo as well; President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; supported their actions during his trip to &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;. In an interview broadcast live from &lt;a href="Tanzania"&gt;Tanzania&lt;/a&gt;, Bush said, "The Kosovans are now independent. It's something I've advocated along with my government."

Meanwhile, Serbia continued to oppose Kosovo, and has now taken legal action against its leaders. Serbian lawmakers rejected the proclamation as "invalid" and "illegal". The President, Prime Minister, and Speaker of Kosovo were charged with "a serious criminal act against the constitutional order and security of Serbia", according to the Interior Ministry.

Serbia will also attempt to prevent Kosovo from gaining admission into the U.N. and other international organizations, with the help of &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;. "The so-called Kosovo state will never be a member of the United Nations," said Serbian foreign minister Vuk Jeremic. "Serbia will use all diplomatic means at its disposal to block Kosovo's recognition."

Russia, which has historically been against Kosovan independence, reiterated their opposition to the act. "Our position is that this declaration should be disregarded by the international community," said Vitaly Churkin, Russia's &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; ambassador. Churkin said he worried for the safety of the Serb minority in Kosovo. "We'll strongly warn against any attempts at repressive measures should Serbs in Kosovo decide not to comply with this unilateral proclamation of independence," he said.

Several thousand ethnic Serbs living in Kosovo went to rallies to protest the declaration, where chants of "This is Serbia!" could be heard. &lt;a href="w%3AMarko%20Jaksic"&gt;Marko Jaksic&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the Serbian Assembly of Kosovo and Metohija, showed up at one of the rallies. "America is no longer the single world power," he said. "The Russians are coming. As long as there is Russia and Serbia, there will never be an independent Kosovo."

Protests held in the &lt;a href="Bosnia"&gt;Bosnia&lt;/a&gt;n city of &lt;a href="w%3ABanja%20Luka"&gt;Banja Luka&lt;/a&gt; were more violent. Dissenters held up signs reading "Kill the &lt;a href="w%3AAlbanians"&gt;Albanians&lt;/a&gt;!", and stones and eggs were reportedly thrown at police.

The European Union has agreed to send some 2,000 police officers and civil administrators to Kosovo to stabilize the situation and help build institutions. "I think it's very important that we recognise that all of the countries of the Western Balkans are European countries and therefore it's critical that Europe shows real leadership in how it ensures that peace and stability are the order of the day," said &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; foreign secretary &lt;a href="David%20Miliband"&gt;David Miliband&lt;/a&gt;.

Despite the majority of European Union members that are expected to recognize Kosovo, several nations, including &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, have already rejected their claim to independence. "The government of Spain will not recognize the unilateral act proclaimed yesterday by the assembly of Kosovo," said Spanish foreign minister Miguel Angel Moratinos. Spain thinks the declaration does not respect international law, he explained.

In &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao expressed concern over Kosovo's bid for independence. "Kosovo's unilateral act can produce a series of results that will lead to seriously negative influence on peace and stability in the Balkan region," he said. 

Other nations which will not recognize Kosovo include &lt;a href="Sri%20Lanka"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Cyprus"&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Greece"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Slovakia"&gt;Slovakia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Bulgaria"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Romania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Vietnam"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Azerbaijan"&gt;Azerbaijan&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Security%20Council"&gt;United Nations Security Council&lt;/a&gt; is scheduled to discuss the issue later today.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Commission"&gt;European Commission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; currently has proposals on the table to extend performers' &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acopyright"&gt;copyright&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; terms. Described by Professor Martin Kretschmer as the "Beatles Extension Act", the proposed measure would extend copyright from 50 to 95 years after recording. A vast number of classical tracks are at stake; the copyright on recordings from the fifties and early sixties is nearing its expiration date, after which it would normally enter the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Apublic%20domain"&gt;public domain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; or become 'public property'. &lt;a href="E.U."&gt;E.U.&lt;/a&gt; Commissioner for the Internal Market and Services &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACharlie%20McCreevy"&gt;Charlie McCreevy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is proposing this extension, and if the other relevant Directorate Generales (Information Society, Consumers, Culture, Trade, Competition, etc.) agree with the proposal, it will be sent to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Parliament"&gt;European Parliament&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

♡❤Wikinews♡❤ contacted Erik Josefsson, European Affairs Coordinator for the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AElectronic%20Frontier%20Foundation"&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (E.F.F.), who invited us to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABrussels"&gt;Brussels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the heart of E.U. policy making, to discuss this new proposal and its implications. Expecting an office interview, we arrived to discover that the event was a party and meetup conveniently coinciding with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFOSDEM"&gt;FOSDEM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 2008 (the Free and Open source Software Developers' European Meeting). The meetup was in a sprawling city centre apartment festooned with E.F.F. flags and looked to be a party that would go on into the early hours of the morning with copious food and drink on tap. As more people showed up for the event it turned out that it was a truly international crowd, with guests from all over &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;.

Eddan Katz, the new International Affairs Director of the E.F.F., had come over from the &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; to connect to the European E.F.F. network, and he gladly took part in our interview. Eddan Katz explained that the Electronic Frontier Foundation is "A non-profit organisation working to protect civil liberties and freedoms online. The E.F.F. has fought for information privacy rights online, in relation to both the government and companies who, with insufficient transparency, collect, aggregate and make abuse of information about individuals." Another major focus of their advocacy is intellectual property, said Eddan: "The E.F.F. represents what would be the public interest, those parts of society that don't have a concentration of power, that the private interests do have in terms of lobbying."

Becky Hogge, Executive Director of the &lt;a href="U.K."&gt;U.K.&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOpen%20Rights%20Group"&gt;Open Rights Group&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (O.R.G.), joined our discussion as well. "The goals of the Open Rights Group are very simple: we speak up whenever we see civil, consumer or human rights being affected by the poor implementation or the poor regulation of new technologies," Becky summarised. "In that sense, people call us -I mean the E.F.F. has been around, in internet years, since the beginning of time- but the Open Rights Group is often called the ♡❤British E.F.F.♡❤"

<h2>The interview</h2>
<h3>Cliff Richard's pension</h3>
Becky explained to us that she was in Brussels to gather support for a European movement against this proposal. She pointed out to us that compelling economic evidence shows that this measure will not help the E.U. single market, and she hopes that other Directorates will oppose it once they get wind of this fact. We asked Becky Hogge to tell us about the new proposal and why she thinks it is not a good idea. 

<h3>Perpetual patents?</h3>
We raised the point that many common people also see copyright as a good thing and something that supports artists, while copyright violation has been said to have led to huge financial losses for the music industry.

We also noted that the term public domain seems to have a more profound meaning in the United States, and that many Europeans don't even know the term.

<h3>The fight moves from the U.K. to Europe</h3>
We asked Becky Hogge to tell us the history behind this proposal from a U.K. perspective.

<h3>Reclaiming democratic processes in the E.U.</h3>

Erik admitted he was disappointed when he compared the way laws are currently made in the European Union to his experience with &lt;a href="Sweden"&gt;Swedish&lt;/a&gt; politics.

At a press conference today, &lt;a href="w%3ADallas%20County"&gt;Dallas County&lt;/a&gt; district attorney Craig Watkins presented several documents and items relating to the 1963 &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20F.%20Kennedy%20assassination"&gt;assassination&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20F.%20Kennedy"&gt;John F. Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;. They were discovered over a year ago in a safe at the county courthouse.

Among these items is a two-page transcript of a conversation alleged to have taken place between &lt;a href="w%3ALee%20Harvey%20Oswald"&gt;Lee Harvey Oswald&lt;/a&gt;, who was arrested for assassinating Kennedy, and &lt;a href="w%3AJack%20Ruby"&gt;Jack Ruby&lt;/a&gt;, who shot and killed Oswald two days after he was arrested. If the conversation was found to be real, it would provide support for many &lt;a href="w%3AKennedy%20assassination%20theories"&gt;conspiracy theories&lt;/a&gt; regarding the assassination. "It will open up the debate as to whether or not there was a conspiracy to assassinate the president," Watkins said.

The transcript suggests that Oswald and Ruby met at Ruby's nightclub on October 4, 1963, where they discussed a plan to "get rid of" then-Attorney General &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Kennedy"&gt;Robert Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; by shooting his brother, the President. "I can still do it, all I need is my rifle and a tall building," Oswald purportedly said. "But it will take time, maybe six months to find the right place..." Ruby says the money for the operation will be coming from the &lt;a href="w%3AMafia"&gt;Mafia&lt;/a&gt;, but when Oswald asks Ruby if he is with the Mafia, Ruby replies with, "You're asking too many questions."

Some have dismissed the transcript as fake, saying it reads more like a screenplay than an actual conversation. "It's not real. Crooks don't talk like that," said Terri Moore, top assistant to Craig Watkins. Also found in the safe were letters written by former District Attorney &lt;a href="w%3AHenry%20Wade"&gt;Henry Wade&lt;/a&gt; regarding a movie he was working on, titled ♡❤Countdown in Dallas♡❤. It is unclear how much work was done on the film, although a movie deal signed by Wade was among the documents found. 

"The fact that it's sitting in Henry Wade's file, and he didn't do anything, indicates he thought it wasn't worth anything," said Gary Mack, curator of the &lt;a href="w%3ASixth%20Floor%20Museum"&gt;Sixth Floor Museum&lt;/a&gt;. "He probably kept it because it was funny. It's hilarious. It's like a bad B movie." Mack says the conversation could not have taken place, as Oswald is believed to have been in &lt;a href="w%3AIrving%2C%20Texas"&gt;Irving&lt;/a&gt; the night of October 4. 

Although Craig Watkins believes the transcript is likely a fake, he said he could not immediately dismiss it as such. Even if the document is bogus, he says, he had always questioned the official explanation for Kennedy's death. "You know me: I'm always a conspiracy theorist," Watkins said. "It was too simple of an explanation. I don't see that."

The other items found in the safe, including Jack Ruby's &lt;a href="w%3Abrass%20knuckles"&gt;brass knuckles&lt;/a&gt;, a leather gun holster, documents from Ruby's trial, and clothes belonging to Ruby and Oswald, are believed to be genuine. After all the items have been scanned, Watkins plans to donate them to a third party, so that they can be viewed by the public. "Our motto has always been that everything is open. We have nothing to hide. So we’re making public everything that we have found in the safe," Watkins said.

There were 4 games played in the National Hockey League on February 18, 2008, including the struggling Detroit Red Wings, who have dropped 6 straight, taking on their rivals the Colorado Avalanche.

<h2>Game summaries</h2>

<h3>Carolina Hurricanes @ New Jersey Devils</h3>

The Devils were on the board first, when &lt;a href="w%3ATravis%20Zajac"&gt;Travis Zajac&lt;/a&gt; scored two minutes into the game. &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Mottau"&gt;Mike Mottau&lt;/a&gt; would score a power play goal just over 5 minutes later to give New Jersey a 2 goal lead. &lt;a href="w%3AJay%20Pandolfo"&gt;Jay Pandolfo&lt;/a&gt; would increase their lead with an early second period goal. &lt;a href="w%3AJeff%20Hamilton%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;Jeff Hamilton&lt;/a&gt; would score an unassisted goal at 6:17 in the second period to put Carolina on the score board. A few minutes later, &lt;a href="w%3AJohnny%20Oduya"&gt;Johnny Oduya&lt;/a&gt; would put the Devils back up by three goals. &lt;a href="w%3AZach%20Parise"&gt;Zach Parise&lt;/a&gt; would score in the closing seconds of the game, his 23rd of the season. The Devils won their 4th in 5 games, and ended Carolina's three game winning streak.
<h3>San Jose Sharks @ New York Islanders</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3AMarcel%20Goc"&gt;Marcel Goc&lt;/a&gt; put the Sharks on the scoreboard at 2:19 in the second period. Halfway through the game, &lt;a href="w%3ARadek%20Martinek"&gt;Radek Martinek&lt;/a&gt; made a shot on goal, hitting the mask of the Sharks goalie &lt;a href="w%3AEvgeni%20Nabokov"&gt;Evgeni Nabokov&lt;/a&gt;, breaking the mask and bloodying the face of the San Jose goalminder. He would return, with stitches, in the third period. &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Thornton"&gt;Joe Thornton&lt;/a&gt; add a goal for San Jose at 2:14 in the third period. After that, it was all the Islanders. &lt;a href="w%3AAndy%20Hilbert"&gt;Andy Hilbert&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Comrie"&gt;Mike Comrie&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AFreddy%20Meyer"&gt;Freddy Meyer&lt;/a&gt; would each score a goal for New York to give them the lead before the game was over.
<h3>Detroit Red Wings @ Colorado Avalanche</h3>

There's no question that the Detroit Red Wings needed a victory, after losing six straight. They picked one up in Colorado. &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Chellios"&gt;Chris Chellios&lt;/a&gt; started the scoring for the Red Wings at 12:03 in the first period. In the closing minute of the first period, &lt;a href="w%3AValtteri%20Filppula"&gt;Valtteri Filppula&lt;/a&gt; would increase the Detroit lead to two with a power-play goal. &lt;a href="w%3AHenrik%20Zetterberg"&gt;Henrik Zetterberg&lt;/a&gt; would light the lamp twice in the second period, first on the power play at 7:42, then again just over two minutes later, to double Detroit's lead.

Red Wing &lt;a href="w%3ANicklas%20Lidstrom"&gt;Nicklas Lidstrom&lt;/a&gt; left the game in the first period after taking a hit from &lt;a href="w%3AIan%20Laperriere"&gt;Ian Laperriere&lt;/a&gt;. Lidstrom got up obviously shaken, and was assisted by a nearby referee for balance as he made his way off the ice. It's been reported that he has injured his right knee. There were also worries of a possible head injury; Lidstrom appeared dazed before getting up from the ice, but tests for a concussion have come back negative.
<h3>Phoenix Coyotes @ Los Angeles Kings</h3>

Phoenix scored first, when &lt;a href="w%3AEd%20Jovanovski"&gt;Ed Jovanovski&lt;/a&gt; got his 10th goal of the season, assisted by &lt;a href="w%3ARadim%20Vrbata"&gt;Radim Vrbata&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AShane%20Doan"&gt;Shane Doan&lt;/a&gt;, to put the Coyotes up early. Less than two minutes later, Vrbata would score a goal of his own to increase the Phoenix advantage to two goals early in the game. &lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Carcillo"&gt;Daniel Carcillo&lt;/a&gt; would put the Coyotes up by three goals at 4:16 in the second period, and &lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Winnik"&gt;Daniel Winnik&lt;/a&gt; would increase the Phoenix lead at 12:40, which was assisted by Jovanovski. Phoenix picked up the victory, and &lt;a href="w%3AWayne%20Gretzky"&gt;Wayne Gretzky&lt;/a&gt; won his hundredth game as head coach of the Coyotes.
<h2>Other news</h2>

According to &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Forsberg"&gt;Peter Forsberg&lt;/a&gt;'s agent, it is unlikely Forsberg will be returning to the NHL this season, this after weeks of speculation over which club would sign the free agent forward. Forsberg hasn't played in the NHL this season due to foot and ankle problems.

The &lt;a href="w%3AChicago%20Blackhawks"&gt;Chicago Blackhawks&lt;/a&gt; re-signed defenseman &lt;a href="w%3ABrent%20Seabrook"&gt;Brent Seabrook&lt;/a&gt; to a three year, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;10.5 million contract. Seabrook has scored 7 goals, 12 assists, and is a +12 this season with the Hawks.

&lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Louis%20Blues%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;St. Louis Blues&lt;/a&gt; goaltender &lt;a href="w%3AManny%20Legace"&gt;Manny Legace&lt;/a&gt; was named the NHL first star of the week. Legace had a 3-0-1 record for the week, and gave up only 5 goals on 130 shots. Islanders left wing &lt;a href="w%3ARuslan%20Fedotenko"&gt;Ruslan Fedotenko&lt;/a&gt; was named the second star. He had 4 goals and an assist, including two goals in the Islanders' 5-4 victory against the &lt;a href="w%3AToronto%20Maple%20Leafs"&gt;Toronto Maple Leafs&lt;/a&gt; on St. Valentine's Day, his first multi-goal game of the season. &lt;a href="w%3AMontreal%20Canadiens"&gt;Montreal Canadiens&lt;/a&gt; goalie &lt;a href="w%3ACarey%20Price"&gt;Carey Price&lt;/a&gt; was named the third star. Price, who has started the last three games for the Habs in place of the struggling &lt;a href="w%3ACristobal%20Huet"&gt;Cristobal Huet&lt;/a&gt;, had 3 wins this week, including a shutout against the &lt;a href="w%3APhiladelphia%20Flyers"&gt;Philadelphia Flyers&lt;/a&gt;.

The captain of the &lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20Hockey%20League"&gt;Ontario Hockey League&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AWindsor%20Spitfires"&gt;Windsor Spitfires&lt;/a&gt;, center &lt;a href="w%3AMickey%20Renaud"&gt;Mickey Renaud&lt;/a&gt;, died after collapsing in his home Monday afternoon. He was rushed to Windsor Regional Hospital in Windsor, Ontario, where he was pronounced dead after attempts at reviving the 19 year old failed. Renaud was drafted by the &lt;a href="w%3ACalgary%20Flames"&gt;Calgary Flames&lt;/a&gt; in 2007, a fifth round pick. He scored 21 goals and 20 assists in the 56 games he played this season.

<h1>2008 Taipei International Book Exhibition: Rain causes traffic jam around exhibition hall</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=2008%20Taipei%20International%20Book%20Exhibition%3A%20Rain%20causes%20traffic%20jam%20around%20exhibition%20hall&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="2008%20Taipei%20International%20Book%20Exhibition"&gt;2008 Taipei International Book Exhibition&lt;/a&gt;, recently closed on Monday (Feb. 18), showed not only significances from visitors' participation but also smooth traffic condition on roads near the &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20World%20Trade%20Center"&gt;Taipei World Trade Center&lt;/a&gt; (TWTC).

Since several MICEs (meetings, incentives, conferences, and exhibitions) were held in the TWTC and Taipei International Convention Center, a major issue for the hall owner &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan%20External%20Trade%20Development%20Council"&gt;TAITRA&lt;/a&gt; and several show organizers and participants was traffic condition near the venues especially in a show related to information technology. If the venue was filled with overflowed visitors, roads near the venues would be gotten in a stuck especially when it rained.

Even though the &lt;a href="w%3AXinyi%20Line%20%28TRTS%29"&gt;Xinyi Line of Taipei Metro&lt;/a&gt; is still under construction, and the 2008 Taipei Lantern Festival is still held in the Xinyi Shopping Area and Taipei City Hall Square, the traffic condition on Shi-fu Road, Song-chih Road, and Song-shou Road had some differences with a sudden rain in Sunday (Feb. 17) afternoon, in which period made a major impact in corrupting good traffic condition in the TIBE 2008 especially from Saturday (Feb. 16) to Sunday morning, in which period, a bad traffic condition ever taken place in past years.

Even though what the TIBE will be transformed, the overall image and quality from an exhibition including the TIBE will be determined by several factors especially operations and contents from the venue owner and show organizers.

&lt;a href="Fidel%20Castro"&gt;Fidel Castro&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="Cuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;n president who seized power in a 1959 revolution, has stated in a quote in Cuba's state-run newspaper ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AGranma"&gt;Granma&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that when the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Assembly%20of%20People%27s%20Power"&gt;National Assembly of Cuba&lt;/a&gt; meets on February 24 he "will not aspire to or accept... the positions of President of Council of State and Commander in Chief."

81-year-old Castro handed over control to his 76-year-old brother &lt;a href="w%3ARa%C3%BAl%20Castro"&gt;Raúl&lt;/a&gt; when he underwent surgery in July 2006. "It would betray my conscience to take up a responsibility that requires mobility and total devotion, that I am not in a physical condition to offer," Castro explained.

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; said, "I believe that the change from Fidel Castro ought to begin a period of democratic transition." Although, &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Negroponte"&gt;John Negroponte&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Deputy%20Secretary%20of%20State"&gt;Deputy Secretary of State&lt;/a&gt;, said that this does not mean that the 1962 trade embargo will be lifted "any time soon."

&lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; said that it hopes to improve relations with Cuba, which were almost at a standstill under Castro. Spokesperson John Clancy said the EU is willing to engage with Cuba in constructive dialogue to foster a peaceful transition to pluralistic democracy in Cuba.

China said it will maintain its current cooperation with Cuba and termed Fidel Castro an old friend. A spokesperson for the foreign ministry of Vietnam similarly praised Castro as a great friend and comrade.

&lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20News"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; reports that Raúl Castro is seen by analysts as the likely choice as successor by the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Assembly%20of%20People%27s%20Power"&gt;National Assembly&lt;/a&gt;, though some see 56-year-old &lt;a href="w%3ACarlos%20Lage%20D%C3%A1vila"&gt;Carlos Lage Dávila&lt;/a&gt; as potential candidate. Lage is currently Vice-President and Executive Secretary of the &lt;a href="w%3ACouncil%20of%20Ministers%20of%20Cuba"&gt;Council of Ministers&lt;/a&gt;.

The decision is scheduled for February 24, 2008.

In the Hall 1 of &lt;a href="2008%20Taipei%20International%20Book%20Exhibition"&gt;2008 Taipei International Book Exhibition&lt;/a&gt;, the public often think this hall as a collective from general books. But this year, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Daily%20News"&gt;United Daily News Group&lt;/a&gt; (聯合報系) not only participated in this show with major brands on Economic Daily News (經濟日報), Linking Publishing (聯經出版社), and United Daily News Online (聯合線上), but also announced two interactive e-books with &lt;a href="w%3AOld%20Master%20Q"&gt;Old Master Q&lt;/a&gt; and Wan-Wan (彎彎) on Saturday (Feb. 16). With two major announcements, the General Book Hall conjoined with a fashion of comic.

The "Old Master Q" became a fashion in not only &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; but also &lt;a href="w%3AChinese-language"&gt;Chinese-language&lt;/a&gt; world because readers in Chinese-language world wanted to collect whole series and recommended its series as "Must Buy Series", its humor style attracted readers to read. After several arrangements with music and flash movies, the "Old Master Q" series will be more interactive than a simple comic book.

Joseph Chak Wong (王澤) ever replied a question to local media about its characteristic and said:

In the afternoon, a Taiwanese famous blogger drawer "Wan-Wan" Chia-wei Hu participated the E-book launch of ♡❤"Can't I go to work? A drawing diary by Wan-Wan."♡❤. The original author, Wan-Wan said to media and fans:
After her words, the possibility of brand establishment on Wan-Wan's work may be increased in the future for the global marketing in comic world.

<h1>Voracious fire generates panic in Buenos Aires, Argentina</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Voracious%20fire%20generates%20panic%20in%20Buenos%20Aires%2C%20Argentina&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Firemen were working to control a large fire in a party supply warehouse in the populous neighborhood of &lt;a href="w%3ABalvanera"&gt;Once&lt;/a&gt; in the Argentine capital.

The fire began in the fourth floor at approximately 15:15 hours and rapidly spread to the rest of the building, located on 2257 Lavalle street between Pasteur and Uriburu streets. The building houses a wholesale company called "Ciudad Cotillón" (Party City), which sells highly flammable elements like foam, &lt;a href="w%3Acarnival"&gt;carnival&lt;/a&gt; outfits, and products made with &lt;a href="w%3Apolystyrene"&gt;polystyrene&lt;/a&gt;.

According to the firemen of the &lt;a href="w%3APolic%C3%ADa%20Federal%20Argentina"&gt;Federal Police&lt;/a&gt;, there exists a "real danger" of precipice of the damaged building, for which the Guard of Aid and SAME ambulances remain in the area.

Nearby buildings were evacuated and the traffic was closed in the Larrea and Lavalle streets, from Tucumán up to Uriburu, producing chaos in the traffic.

The fire's toxic smoke and smell expanded towards the northern zone of the city. More than 50 people were injured after inhaling the smoke. A cameraman of the &lt;a href="w%3ATelef%C3%A9"&gt;Telefé&lt;/a&gt; suffered poisoning and was taken to the Ramos Mejía hospital.

One of the firemen who was attacking the fire fell to the street below and suffered multiple injuries. He was moved with urgency to an hospital.

The hospitals of the city were declared to be in a ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3Ared%20alert"&gt;state of red alert&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, to be able to attend to those affected by the inhalation of toxic gases.

There were 9 games played in the National Hockey League on February 20, 2008.

<h2>Game summaries</h2>

<h3>Boston Bruins @ Carolina Hurricanes</h3>

The Bruins would take advantage of two of their power plays in the first two periods. &lt;a href="w%3AZdeno%20Chara"&gt;Zdeno Chara&lt;/a&gt; scored his 11th goal of the year in the first, and &lt;a href="w%3AMarc%20Savard"&gt;Marc Savard&lt;/a&gt; his 14th of the season. Two late third period goals would tie the score, one by &lt;a href="w%3ARay%20Whitney%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;Ray Whitney&lt;/a&gt; and another by &lt;a href="w%3AErik%20Cole"&gt;Erik Cole&lt;/a&gt; 20 seconds later. After a scoreless 5 minutes of 4-on-4 overtime, the game went to a shootout. &lt;a href="w%3ATim%20Thomas%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;Tim Thomas&lt;/a&gt; stopped both of Carolina's shooters. &lt;a href="w%3APhil%20Kessel"&gt;Phil Kessel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Krejci"&gt;David Krejci&lt;/a&gt; each scored for Boston, to give them the extra point in the standings. Thomas made 45 saves for the Bruins.
<h3>Columbus Blue Jackets @ Toronto Maple Leafs</h3>

Toronto's &lt;a href="w%3ACarlo%20Colaiacovo"&gt;Carlo Colaiacovo&lt;/a&gt; scored his second goal of the season to put the Leafs up first at 5:41 in the first period. A &lt;a href="w%3ANik%20Antropov"&gt;Nik Antropov&lt;/a&gt; power play goal would give Toronto a two goal advantage over the Blue Jackets later in the period. Columbus would answer 30 seconds later when &lt;a href="w%3ANikolai%20Zherdev"&gt;Nikolai Zherdev&lt;/a&gt; beat Leaf goaltender &lt;a href="w%3AVesa%20Toskala"&gt;Vesa Toskala&lt;/a&gt; to cut Toronto's lead in half. &lt;a href="w%3AChad%20Kilger"&gt;Chad Kilger&lt;/a&gt; scored his 10th of the season before the first period was over to give Toronto a 3-1 lead, and the score stayed that way through the end of the game. &lt;a href="w%3ADominic%20Moore"&gt;Dominic Moore&lt;/a&gt; earned two points, assisting on both the Colaiacovo and Kilger goals.
<h3>New York Rangers @ Montreal Canadiens</h3>

Montreal came back after being down 5-0 in the 2nd period to give the Canadiens their fourth straight victory. &lt;a href="w%3ABrandon%20Dubinsky"&gt;Brandon Dubinsky&lt;/a&gt; would put New York up 8:50 into the game. &lt;a href="w%3ASean%20Avery"&gt;Sean Avery&lt;/a&gt; added to the Rangers lead 14 seconds later. &lt;a href="w%3ABrendan%20Shanahan"&gt;Brendan Shanahan&lt;/a&gt; scored back to back power play goals, first at 13:56 in the first period, then at 4:35 in the second period. &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Drury"&gt;Chris Drury&lt;/a&gt; would give the Rangers a 5 goal advantage less than a minute later. After that, the Canadiens got to work. &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Ryder"&gt;Michael Ryder&lt;/a&gt; scored back-to-back goals of his own to cut the lead by two by the end of the second period. &lt;a href="w%3AAlexei%20Kovalev"&gt;Alexei Kovalev&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Streit"&gt;Mark Streit&lt;/a&gt; would each put a puck past &lt;a href="w%3AHenrik%20Lundqvist"&gt;Henrik Lundqvist&lt;/a&gt; 9 seconds apart. Then Kovalev would score his second of the night to even the score on a Montreal power play. &lt;a href="w%3ASaku%20Koivu"&gt;Saku Koivu&lt;/a&gt; scored the only shootout goal for the Canadiens.
<h3>Philadelphia Flyers @ Ottawa Senators</h3>

The Senators broke a three game winless streak, while giving the Flyers their eighth straight loss. &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Kelly%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;Chris Kelly&lt;/a&gt; would score a short handed goal early in the game to give the Senators the early lead. Then &lt;a href="w%3AAntoine%20Vermette"&gt;Antoine Vermette&lt;/a&gt; would score his 14th goal of the season to give Ottawa a 2-0 lead. Philadelphia would get on the board in the closing minute of the 2nd period with a &lt;a href="w%3AKimmo%20Timonen"&gt;Kimmo Timonen&lt;/a&gt; short handed goal. &lt;a href="w%3AScottie%20Upshall"&gt;Scottie Upshall&lt;/a&gt; would tie the game at 3:09 in the third period. In the shootout, &lt;a href="w%3AJason%20Spezza"&gt;Jason Spezza&lt;/a&gt; scored in the third round to give Ottawa a 2-1 advantage. &lt;a href="w%3ARay%20Emery"&gt;Ray Emery&lt;/a&gt; made the save on &lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Briere"&gt;Daniel Briere&lt;/a&gt;'s attempt to win it for the Senators.

While nearly all cover of the &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20Presidential%20election"&gt;2008 Presidential election&lt;/a&gt; has focused on the Democratic and Republican candidates, the race for the White House also includes independents and third party candidates. These parties represent a variety of views that may not be acknowledged by the major party platforms.

As a non-partisan news source, &lt;a href="w%3AWikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt; has impartially reached out to these candidates, throughout the campaign. The most recent of our interviews is &lt;a href="North%20Carolina"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, ♡❤♡Tom Millican♡❤♡, an independent corporate manager and Vietnam veteran.

<h2>Interview</h2>

♡❤♡Why do you want to be President?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Have you ever run for political office before? Have you ever been a member of a political party, other than the one you're currently in?♡❤♡

♡❤♡What is your current job?♡❤♡

♡❤♡What skills or ideas do you bring from this position, or previous positions, that will benefit the Oval Office?♡❤♡
♡❤♡Obviously, the next American President and his or her administration will face many diverse issues. But if you were to narrow identify the three most important issues, what would they be? How will you address these issues?♡❤♡

As a young boy I use to lie on my back outside at night and look up at the stars and wonder if there really was someone else out there. Along with that thinking I would ponder why God choose this orb called earth to put his creation upon. As I pondered that I came upon this thought. First, I believe that I was created by God. Fortified with that realization I further believe that when God created us he originally meant for each of us to live forever but as man has often done throughout time man thought he should be as big as God and the rest is history. 

♡❤♡Campaigning for the American presidency is one of the most expensive exercises in the world. How do you deal with the cost and fundraising?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Do you have a running mate yet? Who are they? What are you looking for in a running mate?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Can you win the 2008 Presidential election? Can any third party or independent candidate ever win?♡❤♡

♡❤♡If you can't make it into the &lt;a href="w%3AOval%20Office"&gt;Oval Office&lt;/a&gt;, who would you prefer seeing taking the presidency?♡❤♡

♡❤♡What should the American people keep in mind, when heading to the polls this November?♡❤♡

The &lt;a href="w%3AHigh%20definition%20optical%20disc%20format%20war"&gt;battle&lt;/a&gt; between the two high definition optical disc formats, &lt;a href="w%3ABlu-ray"&gt;Blu-ray&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AHD%20DVD"&gt;HD DVD&lt;/a&gt; has ended after sole HD DVD manufacturer &lt;a href="w%3AToshiba"&gt;Toshiba&lt;/a&gt; has announced it will no longer produce HD DVD players.

In a press conference yesterday, Toshiba president Atsutoshi Nishida announced and confirmed that Toshiba will terminate the R&amp;D plan on HD-DVD products. The key issue to force Toshiba terminating their HD-DVD R&amp;D plan was &lt;a href="w%3AWarner%20Bros."&gt;Warner Bros.&lt;/a&gt;, who changed their R&amp;D plan from HD-DVD to &lt;a href="w%3ABlu-ray"&gt;Blu-ray&lt;/a&gt; on January 4.

In what is a reverse of the &lt;a href="w%3AVHS"&gt;VHS&lt;/a&gt; vs &lt;a href="w%3ABetamax"&gt;Betamax&lt;/a&gt; format war, &lt;a href="w%3ASony"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt;'s Blu-ray has come out on top with the backing of major studios and retailers such as Warner Bros. but also &lt;a href="w%3AWal-Mart"&gt;Wal-Mart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABest%20Buy"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANetflix"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ABlockbuster"&gt;Blockbuster&lt;/a&gt; who announced they would only support Blu-ray exclusively this past month.

Even though Toshiba is currently about to change their R&amp;D plan from HD-DVD to NAND flash drives and micro drives and plan to build two factories in &lt;a href="w%3AIwate%20Prefecture"&gt;Iwate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, the company will provide the maintenance service on discs and players in the future 8 years.

Sony bundled Blu-ray into their &lt;a href="w%3APlayStation%203"&gt;PlayStation 3&lt;/a&gt; game system. &lt;a href="Microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;'s competing &lt;a href="w%3AXbox%20360"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt;, comes with a $200 HD DVD add-on player, whose fate is now undetermined with the demise of HD DVD. Microsoft has said they will wait for what Toshiba has to say.

&lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="tennis"&gt;tennis&lt;/a&gt; player &lt;a href="w%3ARaemon%20Sluiter"&gt;Raemon Sluiter&lt;/a&gt; played his last match as a professional at the &lt;a href="w%3AABN%20AMRO%20World%20Tennis%20Tournament"&gt;ABN AMRO World Tennis Tournament&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ARotterdam"&gt;Rotterdam&lt;/a&gt;. Sluiter lost the first round match in two sets to &lt;a href="France"&gt;Frenchman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Llodra"&gt;Michael Llodra&lt;/a&gt;. After the 82-minute match, Sluiter received a standing ovation from the spectators. "I have never been of world-class," Sluiter said after the match, "but this was a farewell worthy to a world-topper. One can only be grateful."

Sluiter remarked that the results of the match supported his decision to retire, "Today it was clear: I have to play at my best to compete with a sub-topper. In the past I could defeat guys like this and give the real world-class players a hard time. This was symbolic: I'm just not good enough anymore", he said.

Sluiter became a professional tennis player in 1996, his career highlights were mostly on home soil, reacing &lt;a href="w%3AAssociation%20of%20Tennis%20Professionals"&gt;ATP&lt;/a&gt; finals in &lt;a href="w%3AAmsterdam"&gt;Amsterdam&lt;/a&gt; in 2000, and in Rotterdam and &lt;a href="w%3ADutch%20Open%20%28tennis%29"&gt;Amersfoort&lt;/a&gt; in 2003, as well as a semi-final appearance in Rosmalen. Another career highlight was reaching the semi-finals with the Dutch &lt;a href="w%3ADavis%20Cup"&gt;Davis Cup&lt;/a&gt; team in 2001. He announced his retirement in February 2008.

The &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;n province of &lt;a href="w%3AAceh"&gt;Aceh&lt;/a&gt; was struck by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake at 3:08 PM local time (8:08 AM GMT). The epicentre was 319 km (198 miles) off the coast of &lt;a href="w%3ASumatra"&gt;Sumatra&lt;/a&gt;, close to the island of &lt;a href="w%3ASimeulue"&gt;Simeulue&lt;/a&gt;. At least three people have been killed and several buildings have been damaged. The same region was hit by an earthquake in 2004, that triggered a &lt;a href="w%3Atsunami"&gt;tsunami&lt;/a&gt;. In 2004 over 170,000 people were killed or missing.

According to local citizens the quake lasted about one minute and was felt in &lt;a href="w%3ABanda%20Aceh"&gt;Banda Aceh&lt;/a&gt;, the province capital, approximately 300 km (185 mls) away, also in &lt;a href="w%3AMeulaboh"&gt;Meulaboh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGunung%20Sitoli"&gt;Gunung Sitoli&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="w%3ANias"&gt;Nias&lt;/a&gt; island. The &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Geological%20Survey"&gt;U.S. Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt;, that reported the earthquake, says that no local tsunami warning has been issued.

Minutes after the quake hit, the &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Tsunami%20Warning%20Center"&gt;Pacific Tsunami Warning Center&lt;/a&gt; issued a warning that parts of the Sumatran coast were at risk of a possible tsunami but was later cancelled. &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;'s meteorological agency said &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AAndaman%20islands"&gt;Andaman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANicobar%20islands"&gt;Nicobar&lt;/a&gt; island chain was also at risk.

Indonesia's meteorology and geophysics agency recorded at least two aftershocks about 20 minutes after the first tremors, one measuring 5.5 and the other 5.3 on the &lt;a href="w%3ARichter%20scale"&gt;Richter scale&lt;/a&gt;. Budi Waluyo, an official at the National Meteorology and Geophysics Agency said the quake occurred about 30 kilometres beneath the ground. The US Geological Survey measured the quake at 7.6 on the Richter scale. "The quake has no tsunami potential because it's happening under the ground, not the sea," Waluyo said.

&lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle"&gt;Space Shuttle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Atlantis"&gt;♡❤Atlantis♡❤&lt;/a&gt; has landed on runway 15 of the &lt;a href="w%3AKennedy%20Space%20Center"&gt;Kennedy Space Center&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AShuttle%20Landing%20Facility"&gt;Shuttle Landing Facility&lt;/a&gt;, completing the &lt;a href="w%3ASTS-122"&gt;STS-122&lt;/a&gt; mission to the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Space%20Station"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt; (ISS). Landing occurred at the earliest opportunity today, with ♡❤Atlantis♡❤ touching down at 14:07:10 GMT (09:07:10 local time), following a de-orbit burn at 13:00 GMT, and entry interface at 13:35. Wheel-stop occurred at 14:08:08 GMT.

During STS-122, the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AColumbus%20%28ISS%20module%29"&gt;Columbus&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ module was installed on the space station, a nitrogen coolant tank was replaced, and a the CMG-3 control gyroscope, which had been removed during the &lt;a href="w%3ASTS-118"&gt;STS-118&lt;/a&gt; mission last August, was collected for return to Earth. Three spacewalks were conducted. The mission lasted 12 days, 18 hours, 21 minutes, and 40 seconds.

Seven &lt;a href="w%3Aastronaut"&gt;astronaut&lt;/a&gt;s returned to Earth aboard ♡❤Atlantis♡❤; &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Frick"&gt;Stephen Frick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAlan%20G.%20Poindexter"&gt;Alan G. Poindexter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALeland%20D.%20Melvin"&gt;Leland D. Melvin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARex%20J.%20Walheim"&gt;Rex J. Walheim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHans%20Schlegel"&gt;Hans Schlegel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AStanley%20G.%20Love"&gt;Stanley G. Love&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20M.%20Tani"&gt;Daniel M. Tani&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AL%C3%A9opold%20Eyharts"&gt;Léopold Eyharts&lt;/a&gt; was launched aboard ♡❤Atlantis♡❤, but remained aboard the station, replacing Tani as part of the &lt;a href="w%3AExpedition%2016"&gt;Expedition 16&lt;/a&gt; crew. Tani returned to Earth after 120 days in space as a member of Expedition 16. He was originally scheduled to return in December, however this was delayed because of problems launching ♡❤Atlantis♡❤. 

♡❤Atlantis♡❤♡ successful landing means that there is now no impediment to the &lt;a href="US%20military%20to%20shoot%20down%20errant%20spy%20satellite"&gt;US Navy's attempt to destroy a failed satellite in orbit&lt;/a&gt;, which is expected to occur at 03:30 GMT tomorrow morning. This could not have been conducted before ♡❤Atlantis♡❤ landed, as the debris it is expected to create could have damaged the Shuttle as it descended from orbit.

The next Space Shuttle mission, &lt;a href="w%3ASTS-123"&gt;STS-123&lt;/a&gt;, using the Space Shuttle &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Endeavour"&gt;♡❤Endeavour♡❤&lt;/a&gt;, is scheduled to launch in early March, with &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;ese and &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; components for the Space Station. ♡❤Atlantis♡❤♡ next mission will be &lt;a href="w%3ASTS-125"&gt;STS-125&lt;/a&gt;, the final mission to service the &lt;a href="w%3AHubble%20Space%20Telescope"&gt;Hubble Space Telescope&lt;/a&gt;, which is scheduled for launch in late August.

&lt;a href="w%3AEmily%20Perry%20%28English%20actress%29"&gt;Emily Perry&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; actress has died at the age of 100.

Born on June 28, 1907 in Torquay, Devon, &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;, she was known for playing &lt;a href="w%3A%20Madge%20Allsop"&gt;Madge Allsop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADame%20Edna%20Everage"&gt;Dame Edna Everage&lt;/a&gt;'s long-suffering, silent "bridesmaid"; she began playing the role at the age of 80.

&lt;a href="w%3ABarry%20Humphries"&gt;Barry Humphries&lt;/a&gt; (Dame Edna) said, "It is a great loss to me, she was a close friend."

As an actress in her own right, her filmography is limited to her appearances with Dame Edna, except for a 1995 appearance, in her late eighties, on an episode of &lt;a href="w%3ALast%20of%20the%20Summer%20Wine"&gt;Last of the Summer Wine&lt;/a&gt; as "Mrs. Broadbent".

She appeared as herself in ♡❤Night of a Thousand Faces♡❤. Prior to gaining fame, Perry spent 25 years running a dancing school for children.

<h2>Game summaries</h2>

<h3>Tampa Bay Lightning @ Buffalo Sabres</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Gratton"&gt;Chris Gratton&lt;/a&gt; scored to give Tampa Bay an early lead. After nearly 40 minutes without a goal, &lt;a href="w%3ABrad%20Richards"&gt;Brad Richards&lt;/a&gt; would put the Lightning ahead by two goals 1:03 into the third period. &lt;a href="w%3ADerek%20Roy"&gt;Derek Roy&lt;/a&gt; put Buffalo on the scoreboard two minutes later, but the Lightning added to their lead less than a minute after that when &lt;a href="w%3AVaclav%20Prospal"&gt;Vaclav Prospal&lt;/a&gt; beat &lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Miller%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;Ryan Miller&lt;/a&gt;. Down 3-1 late in the game, the Sabres needed something to happen, and that something came from #26 &lt;a href="w%3AThomas%20Vanek"&gt;Thomas Vanek&lt;/a&gt;. He scored three consecutive goals, the first two 36 seconds apart, and the last one, the game winning power play goal, 2:25 into overtime. The Sabres snapped a two game losing streak, and a 7 game losing streak in shootouts. The Sabres out-shot the Lightning 46-25.
<h3>San Jose Sharks @ New Jersey Devils</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3AJonathan%20Cheechoo"&gt;Jonathan Cheechoo&lt;/a&gt;, in the closing seconds of San Jose's second power play, put the Sharks on the board early 35 seconds into the second period. &lt;a href="w%3AZach%20Parise"&gt;Zach Parise&lt;/a&gt; tied the score 7:56 into the second, his 24th goal of the season. &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Madden%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;John Madden&lt;/a&gt; gave New Jersey their first lead of the game with 3:04 left in the second period, and &lt;a href="w%3ASergei%20Brylin"&gt;Sergei Brylin&lt;/a&gt; would increase their lead 1:10 later. &lt;a href="w%3AKyle%20McLaren"&gt;Kyle McLaren&lt;/a&gt; cut the Devils' lead in half, but despite doubling New Jersey's shots in the final period, couldn't put another past Devils goalie &lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20Brodeur"&gt;Martin Brodeur&lt;/a&gt;. Devils have now won their third straight, and the Sharks lose their fifth straight game.
<h3>New York Islanders @ Washington Capitals</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Semin"&gt;Alexander Semin&lt;/a&gt; put Washington up early in the game. &lt;a href="w%3ABrooks%20Laich"&gt;Brooks Laich&lt;/a&gt; picked up a power play goal later in the first period to put the Capitals up by two. &lt;a href="w%3AMiroslav%20Satan"&gt;Miroslav Satan&lt;/a&gt; put the Islanders on the board near the halfway point of the game. &lt;a href="w%3AJoseph%20Vasicek"&gt;Joseph Vasicek&lt;/a&gt; scored an unassisted goal 11:09 into the third period to tie the score. In a shootout, &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Comrie"&gt;Mike Comrie&lt;/a&gt; scored the only goal needed for the Islanders to take their fifth straight win, a season high. The Capitals out shot New York 30-19; &lt;a href="w%3ARick%20DiPietro"&gt;Rick DiPietro&lt;/a&gt; saved 28, most coming after Washington's two goals. &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Ovechkin"&gt;Alexander Ovechkin&lt;/a&gt;, the current NHL points leader, has not earned a point in his third consecutive game. 
<h3>Minnesota Wild @ Chicago Blackhawks</h3>

The Blackhawks, who were shut out by the Wild in the season opener, finally got to return the favor. &lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Kane"&gt;Patrick Kane&lt;/a&gt; gave Chicago an early 1-0 lead 3:49 into the game. They would put the Wild further behind them with back-to-back goals by &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Bolland"&gt;David Bolland&lt;/a&gt;, his 2nd and 3rd of the season, the first one late in the second period, then again 5:40 into the third. &lt;a href="w%3ANikolai%20Khabibulin"&gt;Nikolai Khabibulin&lt;/a&gt; stopped all of Minnesota's 38 shots. Chicago wins their 4th of 5 games, while the Wild drop their second in a row. &lt;a href="w%3ARene%20Bourque"&gt;Rene Bourque&lt;/a&gt; assisted in both the Bolland goals. Kane, now with 51 points this season, increases his lead as the NHL's rookie points leader, now 2 ahead of Washington's &lt;a href="w%3ANicklas%20Backstrom"&gt;Nicklas Backstrom&lt;/a&gt;.
<h3>Calgary Flames @ Dallas Stars</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3AAlex%20Tanguay"&gt;Alex Tanguay&lt;/a&gt; put the Flames up first, scoring a power play goal in the first period. &lt;a href="w%3ANiklas%20Hagman"&gt;Niklas Hagman&lt;/a&gt; tied the score for Dallas early in the second period. Tanguay, with his second goal of the night, retook the lead for Calgary on a short handed goal 30 seconds into the third period, then Dallas's &lt;a href="w%3AMattias%20Norstrom"&gt;Mattias Norstrom&lt;/a&gt; scored his first goal of the season to retie the score moments later. With 2:27 left in the game, &lt;a href="w%3AJarome%20Iginla"&gt;Jarome Iginla&lt;/a&gt; scored his 38th goal of the season, the game winner, to give the Flames their second win in a row, and put themselves two points ahead of the &lt;a href="w%3AVancouver%20Canucks"&gt;Vancouver Canucks&lt;/a&gt;, and three points back from Minnesota, the division leader in the Northwest. Dallas lost their second of their past 11 games.
<h3>Colorado Avalanche @ Anaheim Ducks</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3ATeemu%20Selanne"&gt;Teemu Selanne&lt;/a&gt; scored his second goal of the season in a first period Ducks power play to give them the first lead of the game. &lt;a href="w%3AJeff%20Finger"&gt;Jeff Finger&lt;/a&gt; scored for Colorado to tie the score 8:12 through the second period. &lt;a href="w%3AAndrew%20Brunette"&gt;Andrew Brunette&lt;/a&gt; gave the Ducks their first lead of the game later in the period. &lt;a href="w%3ARob%20Niedermayer"&gt;Rob Niedermayer&lt;/a&gt; tied the score for Anaheim, which would send the game into overtime. In a shootout, &lt;a href="w%3ACorey%20Perry"&gt;Corey Perry&lt;/a&gt; scored the only shootout goal, which is all Anaheim needed. &lt;a href="w%3AJean-Sebastien%20Giguere"&gt;Jean-Sebastien Giguere&lt;/a&gt; stopped 26 goals, plus the three Avalanche shootout attempts, to pick up his fifth win in 6 decisions. &lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Getzlaf"&gt;Ryan Getzlaf&lt;/a&gt; assisted in Selanne's goal, his 45th of the season.
<h2>Other news</h2>

&lt;a href="w%3ADetroit%20Red%20Wings"&gt;Detroit Red Wings&lt;/a&gt; defenseman &lt;a href="w%3ANicklas%20Lidstrom"&gt;Nicklas Lidstrom&lt;/a&gt; is expected to be out for three weeks after injuring his knee. Lidstrom, the NHL plus/minus leader with +39, as well as the points leader among defensemen, left Sunday's game in the first period after a hit from Colorado's &lt;a href="w%3AIan%20Laperriere"&gt;Ian Laperriere&lt;/a&gt;. Stars forward &lt;a href="w%3AStu%20Barnes"&gt;Stu Barnes&lt;/a&gt; had eye surgery performed after partially tearing a retina in Saturday's game against Detroit, and is expected to miss a week.

With the trading deadline less than a week away, the &lt;a href="w%3APhiladelphia%20Flyers"&gt;Philadelphia Flyers&lt;/a&gt; traded defenseman &lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Vandermeer"&gt;Jim Vandermeer&lt;/a&gt; to Calgary for a third-round pick in the 2009 entry draft. Vandermeer, who started the season with Chicago, has 3 goals, 12 assists, and 71 penalty minutes this season.

<h1>US Navy successfully destroys disabled spy satellite</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=US%20Navy%20successfully%20destroys%20disabled%20spy%20satellite&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Navy"&gt;Navy&lt;/a&gt; has successfully destroyed a crippled spy satellite in a decaying orbit, by intercepting it with a missile. A modified &lt;a href="w%3ASM-3"&gt;SM-3&lt;/a&gt; missile was launched from the &lt;a href="w%3AUSS%20Lake%20Erie"&gt;USS Lake Erie&lt;/a&gt; at 03:26 GMT this morning, and intercepted the &lt;a href="w%3AUSA-193"&gt;USA-193&lt;/a&gt; satellite around three minutes later. It has been reported that the satellite has broken into around 80 pieces, some of which have already re-entered the Earth's atmosphere. The SM-3 missile was designed to shoot down other missiles, however for this launch, it was modified to act as an &lt;a href="w%3AAnti-satellite%20weapon"&gt;anti-satellite weapon&lt;/a&gt; (ASAT). This was the first time the US military had used an ASAT since 1985. &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, however, destroyed an old orbiting satellite on January 11, 2007.

The satellite, which was known by the designations USA-193 and NRO L-21, was launched in December 2006, by a &lt;a href="w%3ADelta%20II"&gt;Delta II&lt;/a&gt; rocket. It was believed to have been a new type of &lt;a href="w%3Aspy%20satellite"&gt;spy satellite&lt;/a&gt;, however it was reported to have failed within hours of launch. This resulted in it being stranded in a decaying orbit, with a full tank of potentially toxic &lt;a href="w%3Ahydrazine"&gt;hydrazine&lt;/a&gt; propellant. The officially stated purpose of destroying the satellite was to prevent possible contamination from the hydrazine, and protect public safety should it land in a populated area. Claims that the destruction was politically motivated — to demonstrate to China, who tested an anti-satellite weapon last year — or to ensure that the satellite's classified technology did not survive re-entry and land in a hostile country, have been denied by officials. Officials believe the hydrazine tank has been destroyed, however it will take about a day to confirm this.

The Chinese government, who received criticism from the US government for shooting down one of their own satellites last year, have claimed the satellite's destruction represents "possible harm to outer space security". Bryan Whitman, a spokesman for the US government replied that destroying the satellite was "about reducing the risk to human life on Earth, nothing more".

&lt;a href="w%3APula"&gt;Pula&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Croatia"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt; - Blasts destroyed two vans owned by ethnic Albanian shop owners at two different locations in Pula, a city in the Croatian region of &lt;a href="w%3AIstria"&gt;Istria&lt;/a&gt;. There were no injuries in the explosions and there was no responsibility attributed. 

Relatives of the shop owners attributed the explosions to the present situation regarding the declaration of independence of &lt;a href="Kosovo"&gt;Kosovo&lt;/a&gt;. There are some 2,000 ethnic Albanians in Istria.

<h1>John McCain denies romantic relationship with lobbyist</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=John%20McCain%20denies%20romantic%20relationship%20with%20lobbyist&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;Presidential&lt;/a&gt; candidate &lt;a href="John%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt; (R-AZ) has denied that he had a romantic relationship with a female telecommunications (Vickie Iseman) &lt;a href="w%3Alobbyist"&gt;lobbyist&lt;/a&gt; and stated the suggestion that he displayed favoritism for her clients is "not true."

The denial follows a report in Thursday's ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Times"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that cited former advisors who believed McCain's relationship with the lobbyist had become sexual.

"I'm very disappointed in the article. It's not true," the likely &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republican Party&lt;/a&gt; presidential nominee said as his wife, &lt;a href="w%3ACindy%20McCain"&gt;Cindy&lt;/a&gt;, stood beside him during a news conference called to address the matter. 

"I've served this nation honorably for more than half a century," said McCain, a four-term &lt;a href="Arizona"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senator"&gt;senator&lt;/a&gt; and former &lt;a href="w%3ANavy"&gt;Navy&lt;/a&gt; pilot. "At no time have I ever done anything that would betray the public trust."

"I intend to move on," he added so as to not have to answer more questions.

The ♡❤New York Times♡❤ quoted anonymous aides as saying they had urged McCain and Iseman to stay away from each other prior to his failed presidential campaign in &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Presidential%20election%2C%202000"&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt;. In its own follow-up story, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Washington%20Post"&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ quoted John Weaver, who split with McCain last year, as saying he met with lobbyist Iseman and urged her to steer clear of McCain.

But McCain said he was unaware of any such conversation, and denied that his aides ever tried to talk to him about his interactions with Iseman.

"I never discussed it with John Weaver. As far as I know, there was no necessity for it," McCain said. "I don't know anything about it," he added. "John Weaver is a friend of mine. He remains a friend of mine. But I certainly didn't know anything of that nature." 
"More importantly, my children and I not only trust my husband, but know that he would never do anything to not only disappoint our family, but disappoint the people of America. He's a man of great character," Cindy McCain said.

The couple smiled nervously throughout the questioning at a &lt;a href="w%3AToledo%2C%20Ohio"&gt;Toledo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Ohio"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt; hotel.

"We think the story speaks for itself," Times executive editor Bill Keller said in a written statement Thursday. "On the timing, our policy is we publish stories when they are ready." 

McCain's remaining rival for the Republican nomination, former &lt;a href="w%3AArkansas"&gt;Arkansas&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGovernor"&gt;Governor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Mike%20Huckabee"&gt;Mike Huckabee&lt;/a&gt;, called McCain "a good decent honorable man" and said he accepted McCain's response. 

"I've campaigned now on the same stage or platform with John McCain for 14 months. I only know him to be a man of integrity," Huckabee said in &lt;a href="w%3AHouston%2C%20Texas"&gt;Houston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;. "Today he denied any of that was true. I take him at his word. For me to get into it is completely immaterial."

The published reports said McCain and Iseman each denied having a sexually-oriented relationship. Neither story asserted that there was a sexually-oriented relationship and offered no evidence that there was, reporting only that aides worried about the appearance of McCain having close ties to a lobbyist with business before the Senate Commerce Committee on which McCain served.

One of McCain's senior advisers, Charlie Black, told &lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; that the campaign first learned in October (2007) the paper was working on a story about McCain's relationship with Iseman.

He said that information and documents provided to the paper disputes suggestions McCain tried to use his influence to help Iseman.

Black further said ♡❤The New York Times♡❤ is a &lt;a href="w%3Aliberal"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; newspaper that was printing "rumors and gossip" to arrive at a harder truth, described as a humble attack on the conservative McCain.

"He doesn't do favors for anyone," Black said of McCain.

In &lt;a href="Serbia"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt;'s capital &lt;a href="w%3ABelgrade"&gt;Belgrade&lt;/a&gt; protesters have broken into the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; embassy, and have set fire to an office, which is now extinguished. The break-in followed massive protests against &lt;a href="Kosovo"&gt;Kosovo&lt;/a&gt;'s independence that was declared last Sunday. A couple of hundreds of thousands protested in front of the parliament building in Belgrade when masked attackers broke into the building and tried to throw office-furniture out the windows. Estimations of a number of protesters vary between 150.000 and 2 millions.

Around 18:00, after the relay, a couple hundred rioters went to Kneza Milosa Street where the US embassy is located. At 18:15 they demolished a part of the embassy and burned it. They also attacked the Croatian embassy, which is around 100 meters from the US embassy on the same street. Around 19:00 police came and clashed with the rioters using tear gas. Riots were all over downtown Belgrade. As of 22:00 the situation was under control but there are still some riots in other streets.

The tear gas polluted a couple blocks, about 350 meters up to &lt;a href="w%3AVra%C4%8Dar"&gt;Vračar hill&lt;/a&gt;.

The nearby &lt;a href="Croatia"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt;n embassy was also attacked. Rocks were thrown at the &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; embassy building. This could be due to the fact that Canada has not said yet if it recognises Kosovo. Embassies of &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina"&gt;Bosnia and Herzegovina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Belgium"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; were also attacked.

One person was found dead at the ground floor of US embassy, around 150 people were injured, including 35 policemen. Around 100 rioters were arrested.

Dirk-Jan Visser, a photo-reporter for the Dutch newspaper ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANRC%20Handelsblad"&gt;NRC Handelsblad&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ was attacked by rioters. People helped him escape, and he has been taken into hospital with broken bones. He is expected to be kept in hospital until the next day. Ambulances and medical cars were called to the scene to help injured people and protesters, some cars were attacked.

Andrey Fyodorov and Andrey Pavlov, journalists of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ARussia%20Today"&gt;Russia Today&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, were also heavily attacked during the riots.

Two &lt;a href="w%3AMcDonald"&gt;McDonald&lt;/a&gt;'s restaurants on squares &lt;a href="w%3ATerazije"&gt;Terazije&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASlavija%20%28Belgrade%29"&gt;Slavija&lt;/a&gt; were attacked. The restaurant on Slavija has been heavily damaged. Kiosks, stores and banks were robbed all over the centre of Belgrade. The protesters tried to attack radio/television station ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AB92"&gt;B92&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ but police had the scene under control.

"As long as we live, Kosovo is Serbia," Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AVojislav%20Kostunica"&gt;Vojislav Kostunica&lt;/a&gt; told the crowd from a stage in front of the old Yugoslav parliament building in Belgrade, "We're not alone in our fight. President &lt;a href="w%3AVladimir%20Putin"&gt;Putin&lt;/a&gt; is with us". A huge banner reading "Kosovo is Serbia" draped the front of the building.

In &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20D.C."&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AState%20Department"&gt;State Department&lt;/a&gt; spokesman &lt;a href="w%3ASean%20McCormack"&gt;Sean McCormack&lt;/a&gt; called out to the Serbian government to protect the U.S. Embassy. He said the U.S. ambassador was at his home and was in contact with U.S. officials.

The United States was one of the first countries, with the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; to recognize Kosovo as an independent state. Serbia however regards Kosovo as a province and is backed up in this by &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; and numerous other countries, including some &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; member states. Kosovo is 90% ethnic &lt;a href="Albania"&gt;Albania&lt;/a&gt;n, with in the north a minority of ethnic Serbians. Belgrade has, however, not been in control over the Kosovo area since 1999, when &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; took control.

High representative of the &lt;a href="w%3ASerbian%20Radical%20Party"&gt;Serbian Radical Party&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAleksandar%20Vucic"&gt;Aleksandar Vucic&lt;/a&gt;, said that "those who provoked Serbian people are equally responsible for destruction as rioters are." President of Serbia &lt;a href="w%3ABoris%20Tadic"&gt;Boris Tadic&lt;/a&gt; and President of the National Assembly &lt;a href="w%3AOliver%20Dulic"&gt;Oliver Dulic&lt;/a&gt; and other ministers called on peace.

Several small &lt;a href="w%3Aearthquake"&gt;earthquakes&lt;/a&gt; have been reported near &lt;a href="w%3AWells%2C%20Nevada"&gt;Wells&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Nevada"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt; after a large &lt;a href="w%3AMoment%20Magnitude%20Scale"&gt;magnitude&lt;/a&gt; 6.0 earthquake struck the region at 6:16 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Time%20Zone"&gt;PST&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC-8"&gt;UTC-8&lt;/a&gt;).

The 6.0 quake, centered 12 miles (19 kilometers) from Wells had a depth of 5.6 miles (9 km) and caused at least 25 buildings to collapse. Damage to other buildings and windows was also reported, and at least two water mains were ruptured. Several cars were hit by bricks as they fell off buildings. One person was hospitalized for a broken arm, but no other injuries were reported.

At least 30 aftershocks ranging from a magnitude 2.0 to 4.0 have been reported since the early morning quake. The quake could be felt as far away as &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Idaho"&gt;Idaho&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Utah"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt;.

Officials in Nevada are currently inspecting roads and dams in the region for damage. &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Emergency%20Management%20Agency"&gt;FEMA&lt;/a&gt; is also on their way to the area to help in the inspections.

Steve Wright has today, at &lt;a href="w%3AIpswich"&gt;Ipswich&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACrown%20Court"&gt;Crown Court&lt;/a&gt;, been convicted of the murders of five women found dead around the &lt;a href="w%3ASuffolk"&gt;Suffolk&lt;/a&gt; town in &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; in December 2006. Tania Nicol, Gemma Adams, Anneli Alderton, Paula Clennell and Annette Nicholls all worked as &lt;a href="w%3Aprostitution"&gt;sex workers&lt;/a&gt; in the area.

The first body, that of Gemma Adams, was found on December 2. She had been reported missing on November 15. Tania Nicol, reported missing on October 30, was found December 8, approximately two miles away. On December 10, the body of Anneli Alderton was spotted by a motorist in woodland near to the village of &lt;a href="w%3ANacton"&gt;Nacton&lt;/a&gt;.

The bodies of Paula Clennell and Annette Nicholls were found near the village of &lt;a href="w%3ALevington"&gt;Levington&lt;/a&gt; on December 12.

Steve Wright was identified as a suspect after &lt;a href="w%3ADNA"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt; evidence was found linking him to the murders. He was arrested on December 19 and charged two days later.

Following the conviction, Detective Chief Superintendent Stewart Gull who led the investigation said that, "These appalling crimes left a community, a county and a nation in a state of profound shock."

"Today’s verdicts demonstrate how the combination of traditional police work and information from the public, coupled with cutting edge DNA science, can be so effective in today’s crime investigations."

Wright will be sentenced at Ipswich Crown Court tomorrow, February 22.

<h1>Pakistan opposition parties form coalition</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Pakistan%20opposition%20parties%20form%20coalition&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;'s two major opposition parties, the &lt;a href="Pakistan%20Peoples%20Party"&gt;Pakistan Peoples Party&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3APakistan%20Muslim%20League%20%28N%29"&gt;Pakistan Muslim League (N)&lt;/a&gt;, have announced they will work together to form a new government after defeating allies of President &lt;a href="Pervez%20Musharraf"&gt;Pervez Musharraf&lt;/a&gt; in Monday's parliamentary elections.

The leaders of the two parties, former Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ANawaz%20Sharif"&gt;Nawaz Sharif&lt;/a&gt; of the Pakistan Muslim League, and &lt;a href="w%3ABenazir%20Bhutto"&gt;Benazir Bhutto&lt;/a&gt;'s husband &lt;a href="w%3AAsif%20Ali%20Zardari"&gt;Asif Ali Zardari&lt;/a&gt; of the PPP, made the announcement today at a joint press conference. "We have agreed on a common agenda. We will work together to form a government together," said Sharif. A smaller opposition party, the &lt;a href="w%3AAwami%20National%20Party"&gt;Awami National Party&lt;/a&gt;, will also be helping the new government, according to the party leaders.

"The future of democracy is within our grasp," Zardari said. "We will strengthen the parliament, we will strengthen democracy, we will work together for Pakistan. We will make a stronger Pakistan."

Zadari says the parties have agreed "in principle" to join together, although details of the agreement have not yet been finalized and remain unclear. "Governance is a serious business," Zadari said, "and everything cannot be decided at a two-hour meeting. We will be meeting again off and on." 

The two leaders did not mention any plans to impeach Musharraf from office, which would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament. But Zadari seemed to indicate that "pro-Musharraf forces" would not be included in the coalition. "I don't believe pro-Musharraf forces exist," he said.

One thing the parties have already agreed on is the reinstatement of judges fired by Musharraf during the state of emergency last November. "In principle there's no disagreement on restoration of the judiciary. We will work on the modalities in parliament," said Sharif.

One of the displaced judges is Chief Justice &lt;a href="w%3AIftikhar%20Muhammad%20Chaudary"&gt;Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudary&lt;/a&gt;, who remains under house arrest in &lt;a href="w%3AIslamabad"&gt;Islamabad&lt;/a&gt;. Pakistani lawyers protested his arrest in the capital and other major cities. Through smuggled cell phones, Chaudary spoke to the protesters, telling them, "Victory is not far off now." Police threw &lt;a href="w%3Atear%20gas"&gt;tear gas&lt;/a&gt; at the protesters, some of whom were hurling stones and burning effigies of the president.

The Pakistan Peoples Party won 88 seats and the Pakistan Muslim League (N) won 66 in the 272-member National Assembly. The pro-Musharraf &lt;a href="w%3APakistan%20Muslim%20League%20%28Q%29"&gt;Pakistan Muslim League&lt;/a&gt; only won 40 seats, thus losing their majority in Parliament.

The President of &lt;a href="East%20Timor"&gt;East Timor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJose%20Ramos-Horta"&gt;Jose Ramos-Horta&lt;/a&gt;, has woken from the induced coma he was put in following an assassination attempt. The President, who was shot by rebels on February 11, is still in a serious condition requiring more surgery, but is recovering, according to the doctors treating him at the &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Darwin%20Hospital"&gt;Royal Darwin Hospital&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ADarwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory"&gt;Darwin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AJose%20Luis%20Guterres"&gt;Jose Luis Guterres&lt;/a&gt;, the East Timorese Deputy Prime Minister, has flown to Darwin, and says that one of the President's first concerns upon regaining consciousness was for his country. "One of his first words was to mention to his close relatives to look after the people of East Timor," he said.

<h2>Game summaries</h2>

<h3>Tampa Bay Lightning @ New York Islanders</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Simon"&gt;Chris Simon&lt;/a&gt; made his return to the Islanders lineup, as New York win their 6th straight, and the Lightning lose their 3rd straight, in this low scoring game at &lt;a href="w%3ANassau%20Veterans%20Memorial%20Coliseum"&gt;Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AUniondale%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Uniondale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AMiroslav%20Satan"&gt;Miroslav Satan&lt;/a&gt; broke the scoreless tie 5:37 into the third period, assisted by &lt;a href="w%3ASean%20Bergenheim"&gt;Sean Bergenheim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ADrew%20Fata"&gt;Drew Fata&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3ARick%20DiPietro"&gt;Rick DiPietro&lt;/a&gt; picked up his third shutout of the season and improved his record to 26-21-7. Simon, who was suspended on December 19 for an on-ice incident where he stepped on Penguin &lt;a href="w%3AJarkko%20Ruutu"&gt;Jarkko Ruutu&lt;/a&gt;'s skate, played 9 shifts, on the ice for 6:17 of the game.
<h3>San Jose Sharks @ Philadelphia Flyers</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3AJonathan%20Cheechoo"&gt;Jonathan Cheechoo&lt;/a&gt; put San Jose up 1-0 15:56 into the first period. The Flyers tied the score on a &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Knuble"&gt;Mike Knuble&lt;/a&gt; goal, his 22nd of the season. &lt;a href="w%3AMilan%20Michalek"&gt;Milan Michalek&lt;/a&gt; put the Sharks back on top early in the third period, and &lt;a href="w%3ADouglas%20Murray"&gt;Douglas Murray&lt;/a&gt; scored on a San Jose power play to put them up by 2. &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Thornton"&gt;Joe Thornton&lt;/a&gt; had 2 assists for the Sharks, his 52nd and 53rd of the season. &lt;a href="w%3AEvgeni%20Nabokov"&gt;Evgeni Nabokov&lt;/a&gt; picked up his 33rd win of the season, stopping 26 shots while allowing only 1. The Sharks break a 5 game losing streak; Philadelphia is now winless in their last 9.
<h3>Atlanta Thrashers @ Carolina Hurricanes</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3ARay%20Whitney%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;Ray Whitney&lt;/a&gt; scored after a scoreless first period to give Carolina the first lead of the game. 1:40 later, &lt;a href="w%3AEric%20Perrin"&gt;Eric Perrin&lt;/a&gt; put Atlanta on the scoreboard to tie the game 1-1. Moments later, a &lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Bayda"&gt;Ryan Bayda&lt;/a&gt; goal put Carlina back on top. &lt;a href="w%3ASergei%20Samsonov"&gt;Sergei Samsonov&lt;/a&gt; gave the Hurricanes a 2 goal advantage 12:25 into the second period. Atlanta cut the deficit in half when &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Recchi"&gt;Mark Recchi&lt;/a&gt; scored on a Thrashers power play. Scott Walker made the score 4-2 3:51 into the third period. A &lt;a href="w%3AKeith%20Aucoin"&gt;Keith Aucoin&lt;/a&gt; goal increased Carolina's lead to 4. &lt;a href="w%3ATodd%20White"&gt;Todd White&lt;/a&gt; scored for Atlanta in the closing minutes of the game, but it wasn't enough to catch up to Carolina, who now snapped a 2 game losing streak.
<h3>Buffalo Sabres @ Toronto Maple Leafs</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3ABrian%20Campbell"&gt;Brian Campbell&lt;/a&gt; put Buffalo in the lead 2:36 into the first period. Less than a minute into the next period, &lt;a href="w%3AThomas%20Vanek"&gt;Thomas Vanek&lt;/a&gt;, coming off of a hat trick performance against Tampa Bay 24 hours earlier, increased the Buffalo lead to two goals. Toronto's &lt;a href="w%3APavel%20Kubina"&gt;Pavel Kubina&lt;/a&gt; scored on a Leafs power play moments later to cut Buffalo's lead in half. Vanek assisted in the next two Buffalo, first when &lt;a href="w%3AAles%20Kotalik"&gt;Ales Kotalik&lt;/a&gt; scored 8:59 into the second period, then again when &lt;a href="w%3ADerek%20Roy"&gt;Derek Roy&lt;/a&gt; scored on Buffalo's 4th power play of the night at 14:49. Kotalik scored his second of the night on an empty net in the closing minute of the game. Buffalo has their 10th win in 14 games, and Vanek picks up his 22nd point in his last 17 games. Buffalo goaltender &lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Miller%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;Ryan Miller&lt;/a&gt; made 34 saves.
<h3>Pittsburgh Penguins @ Montreal Canadiens</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Whitney"&gt;Ryan Whitney&lt;/a&gt; scored 6:46 into the game to put the Penguins up 1-0. &lt;a href="w%3AJarkko%20Ruutu"&gt;Jarkko Ruutu&lt;/a&gt; scored an unassisted goal with 1:13 left in the opening period to give Pittsburgh a two goal advantage. Montreal captain &lt;a href="w%3ASaku%20Koivu"&gt;Saku Koivu&lt;/a&gt; picked up his 12th goal of the year to cut their deficit in half. &lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Malone"&gt;Ryan Malone&lt;/a&gt; put the Penguins back up by two with a power play goal at 6:59 in the second. &lt;a href="w%3AChristopher%20Higgins"&gt;Christopher Higgins&lt;/a&gt; would get Montreal closer on the Canadiens' second power play. &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Ryder"&gt;Michael Ryder&lt;/a&gt; tied the score 21 seconds into the third period, and &lt;a href="w%3ARoman%20Hamrlik"&gt;Roman Hamrlik&lt;/a&gt; gave Montreal their first lead of the game a few minutes later. &lt;a href="w%3AEvgeni%20Malkin"&gt;Evgeni Malkin&lt;/a&gt; scored his 35th goal of the year to retie the score 4-4. &lt;a href="w%3ASergei%20Gonchar"&gt;Sergei Gonchar&lt;/a&gt; scored the go-ahead goal for Pittsburgh as they retake the lead 11 minutes through the final period, and take their third win in a row. Malkin and Whitney each had three points for the Penguins.
<h3>Columbus Blue Jackets @ Ottawa Senators</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3ACory%20Stillman"&gt;Cory Stillman&lt;/a&gt; scored in the opening minute of the game to give the Senators an early 1-0 lead. &lt;a href="w%3ARick%20Nash"&gt;Rick Nash&lt;/a&gt; tied the score with his 32nd goal of the season 4:07 into the second period. &lt;a href="w%3AAndrej%20Meszaros"&gt;Andrej Meszaros&lt;/a&gt; scored on Ottawa's power play to retake the lead for the Senators. &lt;a href="w%3ASergei%20Fedorov"&gt;Sergei Fedorov&lt;/a&gt; tied it up 5:28 into the third to send it to a shootout. Nash and &lt;a href="w%3ANikolai%20Zherdev"&gt;Nikolai Zherdev&lt;/a&gt; each scored on Ottawa's &lt;a href="w%3ARay%20Emery"&gt;Ray Emery&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3APascal%20Leclaire"&gt;Pascal Leclaire&lt;/a&gt; stopped &lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Alfredsson"&gt;Daniel Alfredsson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAntoine%20Vermette"&gt;Antoine Vermette&lt;/a&gt;. Columbus came from behind to win just their third game in 12. 
<h3>Boston Bruins @ Florida Panthers</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3AJay%20Bouwmeester"&gt;Jay Bouwmeester&lt;/a&gt; scored for Florida 2:40 into the game to give the Panthers an early lead. Marco Sturm tied the game early in the second period for Boston. Florida were up by 2 after &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Montador"&gt;Steve Montador&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARostislav%20Olesz"&gt;Rostislav Olesz&lt;/a&gt; each scored goals. &lt;a href="w%3ADennis%20Wideman"&gt;Dennis Wideman&lt;/a&gt; cut the Florida lead in half on Boston's second power play, but &lt;a href="w%3AKamil%20Kreps"&gt;Kamil Kreps&lt;/a&gt; put Florida back up by two with a second remaining in the second period. &lt;a href="w%3AZdeno%20Chara"&gt;Zdeno Chara&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APhil%20Kessel"&gt;Phil Kessel&lt;/a&gt; tied the score with goals 1:38 apart to send the game to overtime. Sturm scored on &lt;a href="w%3ATomas%20Vokoun"&gt;Tomas Vokoun&lt;/a&gt; for the only shootout goal, as Boston sneaks past the Florida Panthers, who have now lost their third straight.
<h3>Vancouver Canucks @ Nashville Predators</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Bieksa"&gt;Kevin Bieksa&lt;/a&gt; made his return to the Canucks lineup tonight against the team he was playing when he suffered a deep gash to his right calf November 1. &lt;a href="w%3AMason%20Raymond"&gt;Mason Raymond&lt;/a&gt; put Vancouver ahead first in the closing minute of the opening period. &lt;a href="w%3AJason%20Arnott"&gt;Jason Arnott&lt;/a&gt; put Nashville on the board 5:42 into the second period on a 5-on-3 power play. &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Edler"&gt;Alexander Edler&lt;/a&gt; retook the lead for Vancouver on a Canucks power play 12:49 into the period, his 6th of the year, which was assisted by Raymond and &lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Shannon"&gt;Ryan Shannon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AMarek%20Zidlicky"&gt;Marek Zidlicky&lt;/a&gt; gave Nashville their second power play goal to tie the score 2-2 and send it to a shootout. Raymond scored the only shootout goal on Nashville goalie &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Mason"&gt;Chris Mason&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3ARoberto%20Luongo"&gt;Roberto Luongo&lt;/a&gt; made 49 saves to keep Vancouver in the game, and stopped all three Nashville attempts in the shootout, as Vancouver picks up their third win in a row.
<h3>St. Louis Blues @ Los Angeles Kings</h3>

After a scoreless first period, the Kings had a flurry of goals in the second period. First, &lt;a href="w%3AAnze%20Kopitar"&gt;Anze Kopitar&lt;/a&gt; scored on Los Angeles' first power play of the game. Soon after, &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Frolov"&gt;Alexander Frolov&lt;/a&gt; scored a pair of back-to-back goals. &lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20O%27Sullivan%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;Patrick O'Sullivan&lt;/a&gt;, after assisting on the first three Kings goals, scored one of his own on Los Angeles' second power play, to give them a four goal lead after two periods. Frolov picked up a hat trick, deflecting a puck &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Cammalleri"&gt;Mike Cammalleri&lt;/a&gt; shot, to give the Kings a 5-0 lead 3:31 into the third, which also gave O'Sullivan his 5th point of the night from an assist. &lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20Rucinsky"&gt;Martin Rucinsky&lt;/a&gt; ruined &lt;a href="w%3ADan%20Cloutier"&gt;Dan Cloutier&lt;/a&gt;'s shutout attempt by scoring with 4:02 left in the game. Cammalleri had 3 points, assisting on all of Frolov's goals. &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Beckford-Tseu"&gt;Chris Beckford-Tseu&lt;/a&gt; made his NHL debut, replacing goaltender &lt;a href="w%3AManny%20Legace"&gt;Manny Legace&lt;/a&gt; in the second period after giving up 4 goals in 19 shots. Cloutier, who filled in for the injured &lt;a href="w%3AJason%20LaBarbera"&gt;Jason LaBarbera&lt;/a&gt;, made 32 saves.
<h2>Other news</h2>

Philadelphia's &lt;a href="w%3ASimon%20Gagne"&gt;Simon Gagne&lt;/a&gt; was told by concussion doctors that he should take the rest of the season off. Gagne, who has 18 points in 25 games this season, suffered his third concussion in 5 months on February 10 in a 4-3 loss to the Penguins.

<h1>Robert Gates hopes to continue US troop cuts in Iraq</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Robert%20Gates%20hopes%20to%20continue%20US%20troop%20cuts%20in%20Iraq&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Speaking aboard a military aircraft, &lt;a href="w%3ADefense%20Secretary"&gt;Defense Secretary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Gates"&gt;Robert Gates&lt;/a&gt; said that he intends to continue US troop reduction in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; over the next 10 months, although he and other commanders are leaning to a July pause in cuts.

Secretary Gates was en route to attend the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States-Australia%20relations%23Political"&gt;Australia-United States Ministerial Consultations&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ACanberra"&gt;Canberra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;. The meetings, also known as AUSMIN, have been held annually since 1985.

Australia has recently announced plans to withdraw troops from Iraq, but Gates indicated that this would not be a source of friction between the two allies.

"We're concerned about the stress on our own forces. The Australians are confronting that challenge themselves," he told reporters aboard the plane.

Gates said a brief pause "is probably necessary in order to be able to assess the pacing of any subsequent drawdowns."

Although he did not say how long a pause would be, his comments suggested that reductions could begin again before the end of the year.

"I don't think there's a need to be doing any trust-building at the AUSMIN meeting tomorrow," said &lt;a href="w%3AMinister%20for%20Defence%20%28Australia%29"&gt;Australian Defence Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJoel%20Fitzgibbon"&gt;Joel Fitzgibbon&lt;/a&gt; on Friday. "The relationship remains very, very strong," he said. "The level of trust has never been higher and I look forward to working forward together with our American friends."

"As the winter accelerates into the springtime and the summer, that's going to increase in pace, and we're hopeful that we can continue that in a measured way that enables us to turn over the bulk of the responsibility to the Iraqis, but at the same time we don't let this thing fall back down the hole again," &lt;a href="w%3AAdmiral%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Admiral&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AWilliam%20Fallon"&gt;William Fallon&lt;/a&gt; said. Fallon, the commander of &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Central%20Command"&gt;United States Central Command&lt;/a&gt;, was speaking today in &lt;a href="w%3AOttawa"&gt;Ottawa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; at a defense conference. He made no mention of a pause.

Another topic at AUSMIN will be the military effort in &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, but Gates says he is not worried that Australia, now headed by &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minster&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Kevin%20Rudd"&gt;Kevin Rudd&lt;/a&gt;, will reduce troop levels there.

"I've had two meetings with their defense minister at this point, and I don't have any sense of a change in direction in Afghanistan," Gates said.

Australia is expected, according to US defense officials, to request a greater role in decision-making process. The &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Security%20Assistance%20Force"&gt;International Security Assistance Force&lt;/a&gt; in Afghanistan is led by &lt;a href="NATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt;, of which Australia is not a member.

<h1>Barack Obama wins Democrats Abroad primary</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Barack%20Obama%20wins%20Democrats%20Abroad%20primary&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt;, the junior senator from &lt;a href="Illinois"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt; and 2008 US presidential candidate won another primary this time in the support of Democrats living outside the United States winning the &lt;a href="w%3ADemocrats%20Abroad"&gt;Democrats Abroad&lt;/a&gt; Global Primary after the results from the contest held across the globe have been tallied.

Obama got about 65 per cent of more than 20,000 votes submitted overseas. &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt; in more than 160 countries cast ballots by mail, fax, in person and for the first time, online. The group set up voting sites in more than 30 countries. The polls were open for one week, starting on February 5 and ending February 12. Most were not typical polling stations - balloting was held in bars, private clubs, or coffee shops.

Democrats Abroad is a officially sanctioned organization recognized by the national Democratic party. This means that Democrats Abroad gets 14 of the 4,000-plus votes at the national convention and is treated like a "state committee" despite not being an American state. However, the votes are half votes and not full votes. So far 9 delegates have been awarded due to the Global Primary, the other 5 will be chosen at a Democrats Abroad convention in Denver in April.

The chair of Democrats Abroad India, Carolyn Sauvage-Mar said, "There were 100 and something voters who brought their kids, their friends, their families. Because they wanted that sense of being together for a really important political moment." Also adding, "This really gives Americans an opportunity to participate."

Sauvage-Mar noted that new and younger voters showed up to the events, including a couple of 18 year olds, Indian-Americans and naturalized citizens from &lt;a href="Ghana"&gt;Ghana&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AGiovanna%20Melandri"&gt;Giovanna Melandri&lt;/a&gt;, the Italian Minister for Youth and Sports holds dual citizenship in Italy and the United States, and is a Democrat, cast her vote for Obama.

"It wasn't an easy choice for me. I would still love seeing a ticket with Obama and Hillary, a drive for change is what is needed in the U.S. and I think that Obama has that drive," Melandri noted in a telephone interview with the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

The Republicans have their own organization for citizens overseas, &lt;a href="w%3ARepublicans%20Abroad"&gt;Republicans Abroad&lt;/a&gt;, however, it is not treated as a "state committee" by the Republican National Committee which heads the Republican Party. As such, they do not hold a primary and do not seat delegates at the convention.

<h1>Australian drug regulator requires warning on Zolpidem</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Australian%20drug%20regulator%20requires%20warning%20on%20Zolpidem&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia's&lt;/a&gt; Therapeutic Goods Administration (TDC) will require makers of the sleeping pill, &lt;a href="w%3AZolpidem"&gt;Zolpidem&lt;/a&gt; (marketed as Stilnox in Australia) to provide a warning about its "bizarre" and "potentially dangerous" side effects. The warning follows a decision by the National Drugs and Poisons Schedule Committee (NDPSC) not to reschedule the drug.

The NDPSC had considered changing zolpidem from a &lt;a href="w%3AStandard%20for%20the%20Uniform%20Scheduling%20of%20Drugs%20and%20Poisons"&gt;Schedule 4&lt;/a&gt; drug to a Schedule 8 drug, which would have placed it in the same category as drugs like &lt;a href="w%3AMorphine"&gt;morphine&lt;/a&gt; and made it more difficult for doctors to prescribe. The NDPSC said zolpidem did not meet criteria to become a Schedule 8 drug because there was insufficient evidence to suggest a "substantial risk of abuse, dependence or misuse for illegal purposes".

The warning follows more than 1000 reports of the drug causing people to walk, drive, eat and have sex while they slept, among other suspected reactions. A TGA spokeswoman said the Adverse Medicine Events Line had also received 19 reports of deaths, most of them suicides, where the patient had been taking zolpidem.

The spokeswoman said coronial inquests on most of these deaths had found no link between the death and zolpidem.

The warning to be included on the Consumer Medical Information sheet inside the packaging will say that the drug "may be associated with potentially dangerous complex sleep-related behaviours … sleepwalking, sleep driving and other bizarre behaviours".

It will also warn patients not to mix zolpidem with alcohol or other Central Nervous System &lt;a href="w%3ADepressant"&gt;depressants&lt;/a&gt; and the drug should "limit use to four weeks maximum under close medical supervision".

Some patients have been prescribed the drug for a number of months, including 30-year-old Sydney woman Mairead Costigan, who fell to her death from the Sydney Harbour Bridge nearly six months ago. Costigan had been prescribed the drug for at least eight months, but just six days before her death she switched to another sleeping pill (&lt;a href="w%3AZopiclone"&gt;zopiclone&lt;/a&gt;).

Ms Costigan's sister Siobhan said her family was disappointed but was not surprised by the TGA's decision.

"I understand that the committee received well over 100 submissions from members of the public who have been adversely affected or lost loved ones," she said.

Independent &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Capital%20Territory"&gt;ACT&lt;/a&gt; politician and staunch opponent of the drug, Helen Cross said that after being prescribed zolpidem, she became addicted to it and tried to commit suicide three times. In one case, she sent friends a text message saying "goodbye" without remembering anything about the incident when police arrived to rescue her.

While prescription information for the drug says it can increase depression and that "suicidal tendencies may be present", Ms Cross says doctors who prescribed the drug did not warn her about these side effects.

A spokeswoman for the drug's manufacturer, &lt;a href="w%3ASanofi-Aventis"&gt;Sanofi-Aventis&lt;/a&gt; said it supported the TGA's decision.

The criticism was a "largely Australian-specific phenomenon and in our view does not accurately reflect [its] safety profile", she said.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Armorize%20Technologies%3A%20Crimes%20use%20%26quot%3BEdison%20Chen%27s%20nude%20photos%26quot%3B%20as%20a%20web%20phishing%20tool&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

In a recent press conference by the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of China, Armorize Technologies disclosed details on &lt;a href="w%3Aphishing"&gt;web-phishing&lt;/a&gt; crimes related to the "&lt;a href="w%3AEdison%20Chen%20photo%20scandal"&gt;Edison Chen photo scandal&lt;/a&gt;". 

The scandal which has become a hot topic in the &lt;a href="w%3AChinese-language"&gt;Chinese-language&lt;/a&gt; world - especially in &lt;a href="Hong%20Kong"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt; - has seen some governments discipline the public for distributing these related photos.

According to Armorize Technologies, organized crime gangs have distributed malicious code recently masquerading as "Edison's photos" through phishing, e-mail hacking, and &lt;a href="w%3AFile%20sharing"&gt;peer-to-peer file transfer&lt;/a&gt;. Even though &lt;a href="Google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; will attempt to tag these phishing sites as dangerous to a user's computer, there are many instances where the malicious code will not be found by anti-virus software such as &lt;a href="w%3ANorton%20AntiVirus"&gt;Norton AntiVirus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AKaspersky%20Anti-Virus"&gt;Kaspersky Anti-Virus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATrend%20Micro%20Internet%20Security"&gt;Trend Micro Internet Security&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ANOD32"&gt;NOD32&lt;/a&gt;.

Also in this conference, Armorize described their HackAlert service:

&lt;a href="w%3AEdison%20Chen"&gt;Edison Chen&lt;/a&gt; had claimed to quit the entertainment industry in Hong Kong, but the (photo) scandal shows yet another &lt;a href="w%3Ainformation%20security"&gt;information security&lt;/a&gt; crisis on the World Wide Web that includes &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;.

Reports say that &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt; has sent at least 10,000 troops into northern &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to take down terrorists from the &lt;a href="w%3AKurdistan%20Workers%20Party"&gt;Kurdistan Workers Party&lt;/a&gt; (PKK) and their bases of operations. Reports also say that thousands more Turkish troops are prepared to enter Iraq if needed.

"The &lt;a href="w%3ATurkish%20Armed%20Forces"&gt;Turkish Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt;, which attach great importance to Iraq's territorial integrity and stability, will return home in the shortest time possible after its goals have been achieved," said a statement posted on the Turkish military's website.

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; military in Iraq is "aware" that Turkish troops have begun to enter the country and Rear Adm. Gregory Smith, a U.S. military spokesman states that "Turkey has given its assurances it will do everything possible to avoid collateral damage to innocent civilians or Kurdish infrastructure."

"The United States continues to support Turkey's right to defend itself from the terrorist activities of the PKK and has encouraged Turkey to use all available means, to include diplomacy and close coordination with the Government of Iraq to ultimately resolve this issue," stated Smith.

On Thursday February 21, Turkish troops began to take out buildings in abandoned villages believed to be hideouts for militants of the PKK.

Steve Wright, yesterday convicted of the &lt;a href="w%3Amurder"&gt;murder&lt;/a&gt; of five women in &lt;a href="w%3AIpswich"&gt;Ipswich&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASuffolk"&gt;Suffolk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;, has today been sentenced at Ipswich &lt;a href="w%3ACrown%20Court"&gt;Crown Court&lt;/a&gt; to life imprisonment. The bodies of the five women who worked as &lt;a href="w%3Aprositution"&gt;sex workers&lt;/a&gt; in Ipswich were found around the town in December 2006.

The judge, Mr Justice Gross said that a "substantial degree of pre-meditation and planning" was involved meaning the requirments for a whole life sentence for Wright was met. He said, "This was a targeted campaign of murder. It is right you should spend your whole life in prison." 

Speaking after the sentencing, Deputy Chief Constable of &lt;a href="w%3ASuffolk%20Constabulary"&gt;Suffolk Police&lt;/a&gt;, Jacqui Cheer said, "At the start of the inquiry we could not have asked for anything more. It is a tribute to all the people who have been involved - not only police officers but their support teams and all the members of the public who phoned-in offering information."

An &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Airlines"&gt;American Airlines&lt;/a&gt; (AA) plane made a safe emergency landing after it was diverted to &lt;a href="w%3AMiami%2C%20Florida"&gt;Miami&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; after the pilot reported that there was a problem with the plane's front landing gear.

The plane, an &lt;a href="w%3AMcDonnell%20Douglas%20MD-80/MD-90"&gt;McDonnell Douglas MD-80/MD-90&lt;/a&gt; flight 862, took off just before 2:00 p.m. (&lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Time%20Zone"&gt;eastern time&lt;/a&gt;) from &lt;a href="w%3APalm%20Beach%20International%20Airport"&gt;Palm Beach International Airport&lt;/a&gt; and was en route to &lt;a href="w%3AChicago%2C%20Illinois"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Illinois"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt; when the problem was reported just after takeoff. 

It circled above &lt;a href="w%3AMiami%20International%20Airport"&gt;Miami International Airport&lt;/a&gt; to burn off fuel and made a safe and uneventful emergency landing.

The plane made a flyby of the airport's tower where officials could make a visual observation. The front gear appeared to be slightly bent in live footage shown by the &lt;a href="w%3AFox%20News%20Channel"&gt;Fox News Channel&lt;/a&gt;.

None of the 138 people on board the plane were injured.

A war museum located in &lt;a href="Norway"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt; has stated that &lt;a href="w%3AAdolf%20Hitler"&gt;Adolf Hitler&lt;/a&gt; has drawn characters from the &lt;a href="w%3AWalt%20Disney"&gt;Walt Disney&lt;/a&gt; film ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASnow%20White%20and%20the%20Seven%20Dwarfs%20%281937%20film%29"&gt;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and were found hidden inside a painting signed "A. Hitler".

Director William Hakvaag says that colored images of the characters Bashful and Doc along with the initials 'A.H.' appear hidden in a painting which tests say date back to 1940, sometime during &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20War%20II"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3APinocchio"&gt;Pinocchio&lt;/a&gt; is also reported to be among the characters drawn by Hitler. He says that he bought the painting for &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;300 at an auction in Germany.

Long before he ruled &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; and his conquest of &lt;a href="w%3AEurope"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;, Adolf Hitler twice tried, unsuccessfully, to enroll at the &lt;a href="w%3AAcademy%20of%20Fine%20Arts%20Vienna"&gt;Academy of Fine Arts Vienna&lt;/a&gt; in 1907 and 1908. He continued to work as an amateur artist until &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20War%20I"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;.

"I am 100 percent sure that these are drawings by Hitler. If one wanted to make a forgery, one would never hide it in the back of a picture, where it might never be discovered," said Hakvaag. Hitler was reported to have owned a copy of the movie, made in 1937.

Hakvaag also says that the initials on the painting, match other historical documents containing authentic Hitler initials. 

So far there has not been any other confirmation of the museum's claims, but other alleged Hitler drawings that sold at auction have turned out to be forgeries.

♡❤Wikinews♡❤ held an exclusive interview with James Burns, one of the candidates for the &lt;a href="w%3ALibertarian%20Party"&gt;Libertarian Party&lt;/a&gt; nomination for the &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20U.S.%20presidential%20election"&gt;2008 U.S. presidential election&lt;/a&gt;.

Burns, the former chairman of the &lt;a href="w%3ANevada"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt; Libertarian Party, was asked if he thinks he has a good shot at winning the Libertarian nomination and ultimately the presidency. He replied, "My chances of winning are not all in my hands. I shall do my best, but it comes down to what others will do. What will you do?"

When asked about America's shrinking &lt;a href="w%3Amiddle%20class"&gt;middle class&lt;/a&gt; he said, "The economic policies of the US government are the cause our troubles. When I am President, the only economic policy I shall pursue is to be frugal with the funds of the United States."

Burns believes that the President "is not 'the leader of the free world,' rather...a person who attempts to protect our rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."

Two pilots are uninjured after a &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AB-2%20Spirit"&gt;B-2 ♡❤Spirit♡❤&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AStealth%20aicraft"&gt;stealth bomber&lt;/a&gt; crashed at &lt;a href="w%3AAndersen%20Air%20Force%20Base"&gt;Andersen Air Force Base&lt;/a&gt;, a U.S. airbase on &lt;a href="Guam"&gt;Guam&lt;/a&gt;. No one on the ground was injured as a result of the crash either. 

According to a statement released by the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Air%20Force"&gt;U.S. Air Force&lt;/a&gt;, the two pilots from the &lt;a href="w%3A509th%20Bomb%20Wing"&gt;509th Bomb Wing&lt;/a&gt; were able to safely eject from the plane before it crashed into the ground at around 10:45 a.m. local time (00:45 GMT) and are said to be in good condition. Witnesses say a large plume of black smoke could be seen rising from the wreckage.

It is not yet known what caused the crash, but an investigation is ongoing.

The plane was making a visit to the island from &lt;a href="Missouri"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AWhiteman%20Air%20Force%20Base"&gt;Whiteman Air Force Base&lt;/a&gt; which is home to all of the U.S.'s 21 B-2 bombers. Each plane costs about 1.2 to 2 billion &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;U.S. dollars&lt;/a&gt; to build. Some of the bombers along with &lt;a href="w%3AB-1%20Lancer"&gt;B-1B&lt;/a&gt;'s are sometimes switched from Guam to the AFB in a routine rotation.

<h1>Australian opposition vows to disrupt parliament on Fridays</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Australian%20opposition%20vows%20to%20disrupt%20parliament%20on%20Fridays&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Discontent with parliament having to sit on a Friday without question time, the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; opposition parties (comprising the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;National&lt;/a&gt; coalition) vowed to continue disrupting Friday sittings until the government bows to its demands. The vow follows a sitting on Friday where the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; descended into chaos. The opposition says it is protesting against the Friday sittings, which were ordered by the &lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Rudd"&gt;Rudd&lt;/a&gt; government to "allow for greater scrutiny and accountability".

The opposition is furious that the sittings will not include question time, have no proper votes and do not record quorum, allowing the Prime Minister and senior ministers to skip the session. The government dismisses this by saying that Friday is a day for private member's business and gives backbenchers an opportunity to be heard.

Steven Ciobo (Liberal, &lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Moncrieff"&gt;Moncrieff&lt;/a&gt;) moved a motion that there should be question time held every Friday, which led to the opposition moving a motion of dissent against speaker of the house, Harry Jenkins (Labor, &lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Skullin"&gt;Skullin&lt;/a&gt;).

After the vote on the motion of dissent was deferred, Mr Ciobo continued to argue for his motion after being requested to return to his seat. He was eventually asked to leave the chamber, but refused to do so and was escorted out by the Serjeant-at-Arms. &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Abbott"&gt;Tony Abbott&lt;/a&gt; (Liberal, &lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Warringah"&gt;Warringah&lt;/a&gt;) was then ejected for an hour after he accused the speaker of acting "dishonorably" and refused to take his seat. Interjections by opposition MPs continued during a discussion about increasing &lt;a href="w%3AOrgan%20donation"&gt;organ donation&lt;/a&gt; rates, with the speaker losing control and suspending the house for 15 minutes.

When parliament resumed, proceedings soon degraded again, after a life-size cardboard cut-out of Kevin Rudd was brought into the chamber by opposition MPs. Luke Hartsuyker (National, &lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Cowper"&gt;Cowper&lt;/a&gt;) used the prop during a discussion about the Rudd government axing a planned &lt;a href="w%3ACentrelink"&gt;Centrelink&lt;/a&gt; call centre in &lt;a href="w%3ACoffs%20Harbour%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Coffs Harbour&lt;/a&gt;. Mr Hartsuyker told parliament "We want the Prime Minister here. I want Kevin Rudd to hear what 150 jobs...".

Mr Hartsuyker was then ejected after refusing to take his seat at the direction of Deputy speaker, Anna Burke (Labor, &lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Chisholm"&gt;Chisholm&lt;/a&gt;) who also demanded that the prop be removed. Ms Burke then removed Joanna Gash (Liberal, &lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Gilmore"&gt;Gilmore&lt;/a&gt;) for making an offensive remark about the chair of the chamber. After more complaints from opposition MPs, the house was adjourned for a second time.

Upon resumption of the house, Speaker Harry Jenkins told MPs they risked facing community condemnation unless they restored the dignity of parliament.

"I understand that some members have concerns about the arrangements of Friday sittings," he told the house.

"If our house is to expect the community to have confidence in it, all members should conduct themselves with decorum and dignity regardless of their views about particular matters - including the conduct of business on future Fridays."

The opposition has remained definant, promising to disrupt future Friday sittings. Manager of opposition business, Joe Hockey (Liberal, &lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20North%20Sydney"&gt;North Sydney&lt;/a&gt; told journalists that "Unless the government does something about their conduct in the parliament, they will continue to have us press for a question time every Friday," 

"This will make a point - we don't want cardboard Kevin here, we want the real Kevin Rudd."

The Manager of government business, Anthony Albanese (Labor, &lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Grayndler"&gt;Grayndler&lt;/a&gt; said the opposition had "reduced to a rabble attacking the good order of parliament".

Mr Albanese then said that former Prime Minster, John Howard never attended parliament for private members' business when it was held on Mondays. He then said there had been "no significant change in the way parliament has operated".

Albanese insisted the new parliamentary sitting schedule did not disadvantage the opposition because it included more sitting days and question times than the previous government averaged. "The changes gave all MPs, particularly backbenchers, the opportunity to put forward their ideas," he said.

♡❤Wikinews♡❤ held an exclusive e-mail interview with James Bruno, author of the political thrillers ♡❤CHASM♡❤ and ♡❤Permanent Interests♡❤. 

Bruno, a former diplomat with the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Department%20of%20State"&gt;U.S. Department of State&lt;/a&gt;, military intelligence officer and journalist, retired early to take up writing. He says that because of his experiences, his books "possess an authenticity rarely matched in the political thriller genre."

When asked about what inspires him to write he replied, "During twenty-five years of working on national security in the federal government, I regularly faced situations which made me say, 'Fiction can't rival this.'"

Bruno holds M.A. degrees from the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Naval%20War%20College"&gt;U.S. Naval War College&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AColumbia%20University"&gt;Columbia University&lt;/a&gt; as well as a B.A. from &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Washington%20University"&gt;George Washington University&lt;/a&gt;.

His books are currently available on Amazon.com and Lulu.com.

The Penguins have their 3 game winning streak snapped when the Senators came back from 3-0 to win it in overtime. &lt;a href="w%3APetr%20Sykora"&gt;Petr Sykora&lt;/a&gt; gave the Penguins an early 1-0 lead. &lt;a href="w%3AColby%20Armstrong"&gt;Colby Armstrong&lt;/a&gt; added a goal for Pittsburgh at 4:09 into the second period to make it 2-0. &lt;a href="w%3AJeff%20Taffe"&gt;Jeff Taffe&lt;/a&gt; put the Penguins up by three goals just past the halfway point of the second period.

&lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Green%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;Mike Green&lt;/a&gt; scored first for Washington to give them the first lead of the game. Carolina tied the score when &lt;a href="w%3AMatt%20Cullen"&gt;Matt Cullen&lt;/a&gt; scored on Carolina's first power play. Washington's &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Semin"&gt;Alexander Semin&lt;/a&gt; scored on his team's first power play. Cullen scored his second of the night early in the second period to tie the score. &lt;a href="w%3AErik%20Cole"&gt;Erik Cole&lt;/a&gt; gave Carolina their first lead of the game moments later. &lt;a href="w%3ABrooks%20Laich"&gt;Brooks Laich&lt;/a&gt; tied the score 3-3 8:47 into the second period. &lt;a href="w%3AEric%20Staal"&gt;Eric Staal&lt;/a&gt; retook the lead for the Hurricanes before the period was done, a goal that ended up being the game winner. &lt;a href="w%3AAndrew%20Ladd"&gt;Andrew Ladd&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Corvo"&gt;Joe Corvo&lt;/a&gt; padded the Hurricanes lead by 3 goals in the third period, but they weren't needed for the victory, as Carolina wins their second in a row, and Washington takes their 4th loss in 5 games. Carolina was 4/7 on power plays, Washington was 2/4. &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Ovechkin"&gt;Alexander Ovechkin&lt;/a&gt; had three points, assisting on all three Washington goals.

The Rangers win their third game in the four game series, which they can have a chance to sweep when they return to Buffalo March 10. Buffalo goalie &lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Miller%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;Ryan Miller&lt;/a&gt; made 31 saves; &lt;a href="w%3AHenrik%20Lundqvist"&gt;Henrik Lundqvist&lt;/a&gt; made 26 for New York.

&lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Briere"&gt;Daniel Briere&lt;/a&gt; scored a power play goal 16:20 into the second period to give them the first lead of the game. It would stay that way until &lt;a href="w%3AJay%20Bouwmeester"&gt;Jay Bouwmeester&lt;/a&gt; scored with 3.7 left in regulation to send it into overtime. &lt;a href="w%3AOlli%20Jokinen"&gt;Olli Jokinen&lt;/a&gt; scored on a power play 3:44 into overtime to break the Panthers' losing streak of 3 games, and give the Flyers their 10th straight loss, tied for their longest losing streak in franchise history. &lt;a href="w%3ACraig%20Anderson%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;Craig Anderson&lt;/a&gt; made his first start since February 10 for the Florida Panthers, and made 40 saves.

&lt;a href="w%3AIBM"&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt; has announced a new project called &lt;a href="w%3AIBM%20Kittyhawk"&gt;♡❤Kittyhawk♡❤&lt;/a&gt;, which entails constructing a &lt;a href="w%3Aglobal"&gt;global-scale&lt;/a&gt; shared &lt;a href="w%3ASupercomputer"&gt;supercomputer&lt;/a&gt; capable of &lt;a href="w%3AHost%20%28network%29"&gt;hosting&lt;/a&gt; the entire &lt;a href="w%3AInternet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt; on one &lt;a href="w%3APlatform%20%28computing%29"&gt;platform&lt;/a&gt; as an &lt;a href="w%3AApplication%20software"&gt;application&lt;/a&gt;. Currently the Internet is a collection of interconnected &lt;a href="w%3Acomputer%20networks"&gt;computer networks&lt;/a&gt;.

IBM has prepared a &lt;a href="w%3Awhite%20paper"&gt;white paper&lt;/a&gt; detailing the project. The Kittyhawk will be based on the previously developed IBM supercomputer called &lt;a href="w%3ABlue%20Gene"&gt;Blue Gene&lt;/a&gt;. In theory the Kittyhawk will have up to 16,384 racks, providing a maximum of 67.1 million &lt;a href="w%3ASemiconductor%20intellectual%20property%20core"&gt;cores&lt;/a&gt; with 32 &lt;a href="w%3Apetabyte"&gt;petabytes&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3Acomputer%20data%20storage"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt;.

According to the introduction of the white paper, "Project Kittyhawk’s goal is to explore the construction and implications of a global-scale shared computer capable of hosting the entire Internet as an application. This research effort is in an early stage, so this paper describes our conjectures and our ongoing work rather than a completed set of results."

The Kittyhawk project has created much discussion in the &lt;a href="w%3Atechnology"&gt;technology&lt;/a&gt; community. One of the main topics of discussion is the comparison of Kittyhawk to &lt;a href="w%3A%20Skynet%20%28fictional%29"&gt;Skynet&lt;/a&gt; the fictional supercomputer, in the movie series &lt;a href="w%3ATerminator%20%28franchise%29"&gt;Terminator&lt;/a&gt;, which attempts to destroy all human life and take over Earth.

Before the main vote of &lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20of%20China%20presidential%20election%2C%202008"&gt;2008 Taiwan Presidential Election&lt;/a&gt; on March 22, the &lt;a href="w%3APublic%20Television%20Service"&gt;Public Television Service&lt;/a&gt; (PTS Taiwan) held the first official TV debate in the PTS Taiwan Building in Taipei, &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;. To improve interactions between two candidates (&lt;a href="w%3AFrank%20Hsieh"&gt;Frank Hsieh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMa%20Ying-jeou"&gt;Ma Ying-jeou&lt;/a&gt;) and potential &lt;a href="w%3ACitizen%20journalism"&gt;citizen journalists&lt;/a&gt; in Taiwan, PTS Taiwan exclusively invited 20 nominated citizen journalists (CJs) to join this special debate and asked for their questions on-site. The new format was supported by several news organizations in Taiwan. 

Before this main debate, PTS Taiwan requested several questions with "30-seconds question challenge by citizens" and ultimately selected 20 questions from varied fields including finance, economics, agriculture, industry, environment, population, territory rehabilitation policy, gender, human rights, education, diplomacy, differences between cities and countrysides, Cross-Strait (&lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Hong%20Kong"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt;, and Taiwan) relationships, national position, culture, and racism.

After the debate, the &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20News%20Agency%20%28Republic%20of%20China%29"&gt;Central News Agency&lt;/a&gt; asked several participating CJs about their satisfaction with the debate format. However, several CJs criticized the answers to their questions as "hollowed answers", while some CJs thought the answers were unexpected for the public.

On the other side, several academic professors were satisfied with their performances and on-site reaction, and a former legislator from Taiwan, Teh-fu Huang, commented on the debate:

Hundreds of developers of &lt;a href="freely%20licensed%20and%20open%20source%20software"&gt;freely licensed and open source software&lt;/a&gt; from all over &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; met in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABrussels"&gt;Brussels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Belgium"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt; this weekend for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFOSDEM"&gt;FOSDEM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 2008. The 8th edition attracted considerably more visitors than previous editions, mainly from Belgium and its neighbouring countries the &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, but also from other European countries and even from the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.

During the conference weekend, presentations touched on programming languages, build systems, gaming (such as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Battle%20for%20Wesnoth"&gt;Battle for Wesnoth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACrystal%20Space"&gt;Crystal Space&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGlobulation%202"&gt;Globulation 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ), packaging, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Avirtualisation"&gt;virtualisation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and web applications. The conference also has rooms (called ♡❤DevRooms♡❤) were developers who usually work together via the internet can meet in real life and share thoughts on their projects; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACentOS"&gt;CentOS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFedora"&gt;Fedora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACrossDesktop"&gt;CrossDesktop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADrupal"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGNOME"&gt;GNOME&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKDE"&gt;KDE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMozilla"&gt;Mozilla&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOpenSUSE"&gt;OpenSUSE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AX.Org%20Server"&gt;X.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; had the biggest rooms this year. The corridors were filled with stands from organisations such as the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFree%20Software%20Foundation%20Europe"&gt;Free Software Foundation Europe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the Free Knowledge Foundation, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADebian"&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUbuntu%20%28Linux%20distribution%29"&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOpenOffice.org"&gt;OpenOffice.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , etc.

Since FOSDEM brings many European open software developers to Brussels, it also provides an important networking opportunity. FOSDEM traditionally kicks off &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABelgian%20beer"&gt;Belgium-style&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on Friday with a beer event, but during the entire weekend several groups hold parties all over town. Wikinews reporters attended a barbecue hosted by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AElectronic%20Frontier%20Foundation"&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (EFF) on Friday for an interview with EFF and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOpen%20Rights%20Group"&gt;Open Rights Group&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; representatives about the upcoming E.U. proposal to extend copyright for performers to 95 years.

<h1>Ralph Nader enters US presidential race as independent</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Ralph%20Nader%20enters%20US%20presidential%20race%20as%20independent&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Political activist &lt;a href="w%3ARalph%20Nader"&gt;Ralph Nader&lt;/a&gt; has announced the launch of an independent campaign for President of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. Nader, who also ran for president in the previous three elections, made the announcement on &lt;a href="w%3ANBC"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt;'s television program ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMeet%20the%20Press"&gt;Meet the Press&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

"Dissent is the mother of ascent, and in that context I have decided to run for president," said Nader.

"In the last few years, big money and the closing down of Washington against citizen groups prevent us from trying to improve our country. And I want everybody to have the right and opportunity to improve their country." 

In 2000, Nader ran for President as a &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Party"&gt;Green Party&lt;/a&gt; candidate and received 2.7% of the popular vote. Many Democrats believe his campaign led to the election of Republican &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; by taking away potential votes for Democrat &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Gore"&gt;Al Gore&lt;/a&gt;, especially in the state of &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;. Nader also ran in 2004 as an independent, but only garnered 0.4% of the vote.

At a press conference yesterday, Democratic candidate &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; doubted that a potential Nader candidacy would have the same impact as in 2000. "I think the job of the Democratic Party is to be so compelling that a few percentage of the vote going to another candidate's not going to make any difference," he said. 

Today, however, Obama was more disapproving of Nader. "He thought that there was no difference between Al Gore and George Bush and, eight years later, I think people realize that Ralph did not know what he was talking about," Obama told reporters.

Democrat &lt;a href="Hillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt; seemed more concerned about Nader's bid. "Obviously it’s not helpful to whoever our Democratic nominee is," she said. "I remember when he did this before, it didn't turn out too well for anyone, especially our country." She said Nader "prevented Al Gore from being the 'greenest' president we could have had", and she hoped his bid will be "just a passing fancy that people won't take too seriously." 

Nader dismissed criticism of his entry into the race, saying, "For anybody who thinks that the third try is something that should be demeaned, it represents persistence, it represents never giving up the struggle for justice."

Meanwhile, Republican candidate &lt;a href="Mike%20Huckabee"&gt;Mike Huckabee&lt;/a&gt; welcomed Nader into the race, in the hopes that he will lessen the Democratic voter base. "I think it would always pull votes away from the Democrats, not the Republicans," he said. "So actually, Republicans would welcome his entry into the race and hope that a few more will join in."

The National Assembly, composed of 614 members previously elected in a January 20, 2008 general election, also chose the new First Vice-President, &lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9%20Ram%C3%B3n%20Machado%20Ventura"&gt;José Ramón Machado Ventura&lt;/a&gt;, along with 29 other members of the &lt;a href="w%3ACouncil%20of%20State%20of%20Cuba"&gt;Council of State&lt;/a&gt;, Cuba's executive power. The Assembly has chosen Cuba's Council of State ever since the &lt;a href="w%3ASocialism"&gt;Socialist&lt;/a&gt; was approved by 97.7% of voters in a &lt;a href="w%3AReferendum"&gt;referendum&lt;/a&gt; in 1976.

This decision comes after &lt;a href="w%3AFidel%20Castro"&gt;Fidel Castro&lt;/a&gt;, who ruled as President ever since rising to power in 1959 with the &lt;a href="w%3ACuban%20Revolution"&gt;Cuban Revolution&lt;/a&gt;, wrote a letter last Tuesday saying that he would not "aspire to or accept... the positions of President of Council of State and Commander in Chief" in today's election for a new President, who also becomes the leader of the Council of State and the Commander in Chief of the &lt;a href="w%3ACuban%20Revolutionary%20Armed%20Forces"&gt;Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt;. According to Voice of America, he will still remain First Secretary of the &lt;a href="w%3ACommunist%20Party%20of%20Cuba"&gt;Communist Party of Cuba&lt;/a&gt;, the only official party in the &lt;a href="w%3ACommunist%20state"&gt;Communist state&lt;/a&gt;.

While &lt;a href="w%3ACuban%20exile"&gt;Cuban exiles&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AMiami"&gt;Miami&lt;/a&gt;, who have escaped Cuba and what they consider a dictatorship in search of a better life in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, celebrated Fidel's retirement as leader of the country, the Cuban streets of &lt;a href="w%3AHavana"&gt;Havana&lt;/a&gt;, the country's capital, have remained calm and all has continued as normal.

Raúl, who is also Fidel's brother, has been acting president of Cuba since July 31, 2006, when Fidel &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Cuban%20transfer%20of%20presidential%20duties"&gt;transferred his presidential power&lt;/a&gt; to him after undergoing an emergency intestinal surgery for what is believed to be &lt;a href="w%3ADiverticulitis"&gt;diverticulitis&lt;/a&gt; and was widely expected to be elected President.

The United States has said the change from one Castro to another would not bring about significant change in Cuba, calling it a "transfer of authority and power from dictator to dictator light."

Before the Assembly meeting, &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; correspondents interviewed Cubans at the Havana Book Fair about what they think the most important task should be for the country's next leader. While many coincided that economical and educational reforms were badly needed, they also stated that Cuba "must keep the same rhythm with the revolution that has already given so much to the people."

<h1>Ugandan government, rebels agree to ceasefire</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Ugandan%20government%2C%20rebels%20agree%20to%20ceasefire&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
On Saturday, the &lt;a href="Uganda"&gt;Uganda&lt;/a&gt;n government signed a permanent &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aceasefire"&gt;ceasefire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALord%27s%20Resistance%20Army"&gt;Lord's Resistance Army&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a self-proclaimed &lt;a href="Christianity"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt; guerilla army which has been rebelling against the government in one of &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;'s longest running conflicts.

The ceasefire will not take effect until the day after both sides sign a comprehensive peace deal, which is expected to be completed later this week. Rebels and government officials hailed the event as a step towards the end of the two-decade long war. 

"Today this is a landmark toward peace in our country," said David Matsanga, one of the rebels involved in the negotiations. "Our people have yearned for that peace for the past 22 years." Chris Magezi, spokesman for the government delegation, called the agreement "another major breakthrough".

The signing was presided over by &lt;a href="Riek%20Machar"&gt;Riek Machar&lt;/a&gt;, vice president of &lt;a href="South%20Sudan"&gt;southern&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Sudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt;. It was the latest development in the ongoing &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2006%E2%80%932008%20Juba%20talks"&gt;peace talks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; being held in &lt;a href="Juba%2C%20Sudan"&gt;Juba&lt;/a&gt; since July 2006. In August 2006, the two sides agreed to a cessation of hostilities. 

According to the terms of the deal, the Lord's Resistance Army will be prohibited from recruiting or rearming soldiers, and they will not be able to travel beyond a temporary assembly area in southern Sudan. The assembly area will be guarded by Sudanese troops.

The only item remaining on the agenda for negotiators is the demobilization of the rebels and their integration into the Ugandan army, an issue which is expected to be dealt with quickly. However, &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; envoy Joaquim Chissano warned, "Let us not be obfuscated by this joy. We must see clearly a way to complete peace."

The Lord's Resistance Army is a group which aims to establish a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Atheocracy"&gt;theocratic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; government in Uganda. In 1986, they revolted against the government and began a conflict which has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced over 2 million. The group is also accused of &lt;a href="human%20rights"&gt;human rights&lt;/a&gt; violations, including mutilating their victims and recruiting children as soldiers.

A &lt;a href="w%3Asuicide%20bomber"&gt;suicide bomber&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AIskandariya"&gt;Iskandariya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, a town just south of the county's capital &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad%2C%20Iraq"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;, blew himself up killing at least 40 people and injuring at least 60 others on Sunday February 24.

Iraqi officials say that the bomber was wearing a vest and then blew himself up after entering a pilgrim 'comfort station' off a main road near where a religious fair is being held for &lt;a href="w%3AShia%20Islam"&gt;Shia&lt;/a&gt; pilgrims. The station was providing items such as water and food to passing pilgrims.

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and Iraqi forces quickly re-established a safe-zone surrounding the pilgrimage fair.

"[We quickly] re-established a safe environment for the rest of the pilgrims as they continued to walk south," said 4th Brigade Commander of the U.S. military's 3rd Infantry Division, Col. Tom James.

This was the second attack in one day believed to be targeting Shia Pilgrims. The first attack was in Doura a district of Baghdad. 49 people were injured and three others were killed when pilgrims passed over a roadside bomb which was followed by militant gunfire.

There were 7 games played in the National Hockey League on February 24, 2008.

<h2>Game summaries</h2>

<h3>Calgary Flames @ Minnesota Wild</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3ADaymond%20Langkow"&gt;Daymond Langkow&lt;/a&gt; gave Calgary their first lead of the game with a first period power play goal. &lt;a href="w%3ACraig%20Conroy"&gt;Craig Conroy&lt;/a&gt; increased the Flames' lead to 2 goals 13:52 into the second period. &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Parrish"&gt;Mark Parrish&lt;/a&gt; put the Wild on the board early in the third period, but despite outshooting Calgary 39-16, Minnesota couldn't get any more goals past &lt;a href="w%3AMiikka%20Kiprusoff"&gt;Miikka Kiprusoff&lt;/a&gt;. The Flames now sit in first place in the Northwest Division, a spot occupied by Minnesota since before the All-Star break.
<h3>San Jose Sharks @ Pittsburgh Penguins</h3>

This game was delayed for a short time due to a zamboni malfunction. That delay also caused a delay in the scoring, since the first two periods ended with a scoreless tie. &lt;a href="w%3AJonathan%20Cheechoo"&gt;Jonathan Cheechoo&lt;/a&gt; put San Jose on the board 3:10 into the third period, &lt;a href="w%3AErik%20Christensen"&gt;Erik Christensen&lt;/a&gt; also scored for the Penguins to tie the game and send it to a shootout. Christiensen and &lt;a href="w%3AJarkko%20Ruutu"&gt;Jarkko Ruutu&lt;/a&gt; scored on their attempts in the shootout, but &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Pavelski"&gt;Joe Pavelski&lt;/a&gt;, Cheechoo, and &lt;a href="w%3AJeremy%20Roenick"&gt;Jeremy Roenick&lt;/a&gt; each scored for San Jose, giving them the victory, their 7th win in their last 8 games against the Penguins.
<h3>New Jersey Devils @ Washington Capitals</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3AJamie%20Langenbrunner"&gt;Jamie Langenbrunner&lt;/a&gt; broke a scoreless tie in the opening minute of the third period. &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Semin"&gt;Alexander Semin&lt;/a&gt; tied the score 2:46 into the third period to tie the score. In overtime, &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Madden%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;John Madden&lt;/a&gt; scored the game winner in the closing minute of the 4-on-4 overtime to give the Devils their 5th straight win. &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Ovechkin"&gt;Alexander Ovechkin&lt;/a&gt; was held to just one assist, but the 1 point was enough to put him tied in first as NHL's point leader with Pittsburgh's &lt;a href="w%3AEvgeni%20Malkin"&gt;Evgeni Malkin&lt;/a&gt;. The Capitals now have lost three straight. &lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20Brodeur"&gt;Martin Brodeur&lt;/a&gt; made 37 saves, getting his 5th win in his last 5 decisions.
<h3>Florida Panthers @ New York Rangers</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3AScott%20Gomez"&gt;Scott Gomez&lt;/a&gt; scored the first goal for the Rangers 7:53 into the first period. In the second period, &lt;a href="w%3AMarek%20Malik"&gt;Marek Malik&lt;/a&gt; scored his first goal of the season. That was closely followed by &lt;a href="w%3AJaromir%20Jagr"&gt;Jaromir Jagr&lt;/a&gt;'s 648th career goal, and the Rangers found themselves up 3-0 going into the second intermission. &lt;a href="w%3ANigel%20Dawes"&gt;Nigel Dawes&lt;/a&gt; gave New York a 4 goal lead, and &lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20Straka"&gt;Martin Straka&lt;/a&gt; would put the Rangers up by 5 goals before the game was over. Gomez had three points, scoring one goal and assisting on the Malik and Dawes goals. &lt;a href="w%3AHenrik%20Lundqvist"&gt;Henrik Lundqvist&lt;/a&gt; was named the first star of the game, after making 23 saves and picking up his 8th shutout as a Ranger.
<h3>Chicago Blackhawks @ Anaheim Ducks</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3ATeemu%20Selanne"&gt;Teemu Selanne&lt;/a&gt; put his first goal of the night past &lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Lalime"&gt;Patrick Lalime&lt;/a&gt; at 7:45 in the first period. Moments later, &lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Getzlaf"&gt;Ryan Getzlaf&lt;/a&gt; scored to put the Ducks up by two. Selanne scored his second goal on Anaheim's second power play to put them up by 3. &lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Sharp"&gt;Patrick Sharp&lt;/a&gt; put Chicago on the board less than a minute later. Anaheim would get it back though, when &lt;a href="w%3AKent%20Huskins"&gt;Kent Huskins&lt;/a&gt; scored early in the second period. Sharp scored his second goal of the night 13:52 through the second period to make the score 4-2. &lt;a href="w%3ABrent%20Seabrook"&gt;Brent Seabrook&lt;/a&gt;'s goal brought the Blackhawks to within 1, but a pair of goals by Selanne and &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Kunitz"&gt;Chris Kunitz&lt;/a&gt; put Anaheim further away. Selanne scored a hat trick, his first since January 11 2007, and a pair of assists. He now has 546 career goals, and moved ahead of &lt;a href="w%3AMaurice%20Richard"&gt;Maurice "The Rocket" Richard&lt;/a&gt; in the list of NHL career goal scorers. Kunitz had 4 points, 1 goal and 3 assists. Sharp and &lt;a href="w%3AJonathan%20Toews"&gt;Jonathan Toews&lt;/a&gt; each had three points for Chicago.
<h3>Colorado Avalanche @ Edmonton Oilers</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3ATyler%20Arnason"&gt;Tyler Arnason&lt;/a&gt; put Colorado on the board 27 seconds into the game. &lt;a href="w%3ABen%20Guite"&gt;Ben Guite&lt;/a&gt; would give the Avalanche a 2 goal lead going into the first intermission. &lt;a href="w%3ASam%20Gagner"&gt;Sam Gagner&lt;/a&gt; put Edmonton within one in the second period. Edmonton tied the score on a &lt;a href="w%3ACurtis%20Glencross"&gt;Curtis Glencross&lt;/a&gt; goal later in the second. The go-ahead goal by &lt;a href="w%3AAndrew%20Cogliano"&gt;Andrew Cogliano&lt;/a&gt; at 7:29 in the 3rd would prove to be the game winner. The Oilers break a 3 game losing streak with their victory.
<h3>St. Louis Blues @ Phoenix Coyotes</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3AZbynek%20Michalek"&gt;Zbynek Michalek&lt;/a&gt; broke a scoreless tie at 4:27 in the second period to put Phoenix ahead by 1. A goal by &lt;a href="w%3AJoel%20Perrault"&gt;Joel Perrault&lt;/a&gt; which ricocheted against &lt;a href="w%3AManny%20Legace"&gt;Manny Legace&lt;/a&gt;'s leg put the Coyotes up by two goals. &lt;a href="w%3AIlya%20Bryzgalov"&gt;Ilya Bryzgalov&lt;/a&gt; saved all of St. Louis' 35 shots, and earned his 4th career shutout. The Blues have now lost 3 straight, and their 8th of their last 9 against the Phoenix Coyotes.

Today in a press conference at Taipei City Hall, the Organizing Committee of &lt;a href="w%3A2009%20Summer%20Deaflympics"&gt;2009 Summer Deaflympics&lt;/a&gt; recently recruited a famous &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;ese theater director &lt;a href="w%3AStan%20Lai"&gt;Stan Sheng-chuan Lai&lt;/a&gt; as the Art Director of 2009 Summer Deaflympics. According to the officials, the opening, closing, and several on-site programs will be arranged by Stan Lai after his participation.

"The ability of &lt;a href="w%3Asign%20language"&gt;sign language&lt;/a&gt; is required for everyone at any Deaflympics or world-class games related to &lt;a href="w%3Adeaf"&gt;deaf&lt;/a&gt; athletes, that's everyone who knows. But on the other hand, it's a great opportunity for &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20City"&gt;Taipei City Government&lt;/a&gt; to showcase creations and cultures and to promote deaf culture since the Government won the bidding to hold the 2009 [Summer] Deaflympics. Besides of professional ability, I think that volunteers from every industry will play a great role to determine the image and result of this game [2009 Summer Deaflympics]," said Stan Lai.

With his participation, the sports and culture industries in Taiwan will make a great combination at 2009 Summer Deaflympics even before its beginning at September 2009.

&lt;a href="Ukraine"&gt;Ukrainian&lt;/a&gt; heavyweight boxer &lt;a href="w%3AWladimir%20Klitschko"&gt;Wladimir Klitschko&lt;/a&gt; began his quest to unify the heavyweight boxing titles Saturday night. The &lt;a href="w%3AIBF"&gt;IBF&lt;/a&gt; Heavyweight Champion defeated &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href="w%3AWBO"&gt;WBO&lt;/a&gt; Heavyweight Champion, &lt;a href="w%3ASultan%20Ibragimov"&gt;Sultan Ibragimov&lt;/a&gt;, by unanimous decision in the main event of a boxing card at &lt;a href="w%3AMadison%20Square%20Garden"&gt;Madison Square Garden&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="New%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;.

Many of the spectators were disappointed by the conservative boxing mechanics used by both Klitschko and the Russian Ibragimov. But the decision was clearly in the Ukrainian's favor, as the scorecards read 119-110, 118-110 and 117-111 in his favor.

It was Ibragimov's first defeat, bringing his record to 22-1-1 with 17 KO's. Klitschko is now 50-3 with 44 KO's.

While Klitschko looks forward to vying for the WBA and WBC titles, held by &lt;a href="Uzbekistan"&gt;Uzbekistan&lt;/a&gt;i &lt;a href="w%3ARuslan%20Chagaev"&gt;Ruslan Chagaev&lt;/a&gt; and Russian &lt;a href="w%3AOleg%20Maskaev"&gt;Oleg Maskaev&lt;/a&gt;, respectively, his next fight will be against &lt;a href="w%3AAleksandr%20Povetkin"&gt;Aleksandr Povetkin&lt;/a&gt; in an IBF-mandated title defense. Chagaev's next fight is against &lt;a href="w%3ALuan%20Krasinqi"&gt;Luan Krasinqi&lt;/a&gt;. Maskaev next fights &lt;a href="w%3ASamuel%20Peter"&gt;Samuel Peter&lt;/a&gt;, with the winner facing Wladimir's brother, &lt;a href="w%3AVitali%20Klitschko"&gt;Vitali Klitschko&lt;/a&gt;.

Since the &lt;a href="2008%20Taipei%20International%20Book%20Exhibition"&gt;2008 Taipei International Book Exhibition&lt;/a&gt;, which ended recently, made several significant differences this year, the arrangements of Comic Hall (TWTC Hall 2, a.k.a Comic Pavilion) showcased its differences with "different style reading style" and "growth of reading population".

<h2>Cosplay Competition, a stage for comic readers and gamers</h2>

After several good reactions from comic, game, and culture industries at the 1st holding last year, the organizer (TBFF) decided to hold this competition again this year. Comparison to last year, the competition level was apparently improved with participants' performances. Due to this factor, the juries got a damn headache to decide "who the champion will be".

According to the official data, participated cosplayers and teams preferred to dress as some characters from Japanese Anime and Games like Naruto, &lt;a href="w%3ADeath%20Note"&gt;Death Note&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABleach%20%28manga%29"&gt;Bleach&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AHaruhi%20Suzumiya%20%28light%20novels%29"&gt;Haruhi Suzumiya&lt;/a&gt;, or to dress as some &lt;a href="w%3Aglove%20puppetry"&gt;glove puppetry&lt;/a&gt; characters. In this competition, it showed a summary of the multiple comic and game culture and a steady population from comic and game readers.

<h2>Different reading senses with combination from different elements</h2>

Since the "Quality of Reading" was promoted by government officials, academical and medical professionals after the "Spiritual Books Area" set from 2003, it was progressively respected by the public after several changes from people's lifestyle like food, living, clothing, and reading.

With a great change of life quality, some hi-end recording companies like Jingo Records, Wind Records, and Welchan Music, tried to make their stages to promote several easy-listening music CDs at this exhibition. By the way, to change the public's mind on the Comic Hall, the TBFF decided to hold two "Starry Night" seminars focused on wine-tasting and classical music. Those two seminars attracted several music and wine fans participating in.

With fans' participation and new designs on the Comic Hall, the TBFF successfully turned the public image of Comic Hall from "a simple hall with signing events and consuming" to "a mixed hall with reading senses" this year.

The song "&lt;a href="w%3AFalling%20Slowly"&gt;Falling Slowly&lt;/a&gt;" is from the 2006 film ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AOnce%20%28film%29"&gt;Once&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, which also co-stars Hansard and Irglová.

The favorite in the category was ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AEnchanted%20%28film%29"&gt;Enchanted&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, a Disney film which received nominations for "&lt;a href="w%3AHappy%20Working%20Song"&gt;Happy Working Song&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="w%3AThat%27s%20How%20You%20Know"&gt;That's How You Know&lt;/a&gt;", and "&lt;a href="w%3ASo%20Close%20%28song%29"&gt;So Close&lt;/a&gt;". Also nominated was "&lt;a href="w%3ARaise%20It%20Up%20%28August%20Rush%20song%29"&gt;Raise It Up&lt;/a&gt;" from ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAugust%20Rush"&gt;August Rush&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

The soundtrack received a Grammy nomination in 2008.

Irglová was cut off by music, when stepping up to the microphone to speak. She was given a second chance to speak after the next commercial break, and was introduced onto the stage by host &lt;a href="w%3AJon%20Stewart"&gt;Jon Stewart&lt;/a&gt;.

For some time, the song's eligibility for an Oscar was in dispute, as it had appeared on a 2006 CD issued by Hansard's band, &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Frames"&gt;The Frames&lt;/a&gt;, and it had been performed by the couple in various European venues. The Academy ruled that because the song had been composed for the movie, and the prior public exposure during the long period that the movie took to produce had been minimal, it remained eligible.

Parts of a body belonging to a child have been discovered at the &lt;a href="w%3AHaut%20de%20la%20Garenne"&gt;Haut de la Garenne&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASaint%20Martin%2C%20Jersey"&gt;Saint Martin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJersey"&gt;Jersey&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACrown%20dependency"&gt;Crown dependency&lt;/a&gt; off the coast of &lt;a href="w%3ANormandy"&gt;Normandy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;.

The Victorian building, which was originally built as a children's care home and is now a &lt;a href="w%3Ayouth%20hostel"&gt;youth hostel&lt;/a&gt;, has been under investigation recently as part of an inquiry into &lt;a href="w%3Achild%20abuse"&gt;child abuse&lt;/a&gt; which occurred during the 1960s. The investigation has now been refocused with the aim to excavate further the grounds of the building, under the command of a specialist team from the UK who will use ground scanners and &lt;a href="w%3Asniffer%20dogs"&gt;sniffer dogs&lt;/a&gt; to detect any other possible remains. 

The body is believed to date from the early 1980s though further information about the identity of the child has not yet been released. The remains were found buried underneath a concrete floor inside the building. Today, the Guardian newspaper revealed that there are fears of a possible six further bodies buried on the site.

"There could be six, but it could be higher than that," according to lead investigator Lenny Harper, who further said, "Allegations range from physical assaults right through to rape. It is difficult to envisage more horrific crimes than some of those that are alleged to have been carried out here." 

A helpline set up to find more information about alleged child abuse at the Haut de la Garenne and Jersey &lt;a href="w%3ASea%20Scouts"&gt;Sea Scouts&lt;/a&gt; has garnered a total of 140 contacts, made up of those claiming to be witnesses or victims to the crimes. The information gathered from the telephone inquiry triggered the search of the grounds.

According to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Geological%20Survey"&gt;United States Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt; (USGS), several large &lt;a href="w%3Aearthquake"&gt;earthquakes&lt;/a&gt; have shaken &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; with the largest having a &lt;a href="w%3AMoment%20Magnitude%20Scale"&gt;magnitude&lt;/a&gt; of 7.0.

The most recent quake had a magnitude of 6.4 and struck at 4:02 a.m. local time February 26, 150 kilometers (94 miles) south, southwest of &lt;a href="w%3APadang%2C%20Indonesia"&gt;Padang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASumatra"&gt;Sumatra&lt;/a&gt;, Indonesia. The depth registered at 35 km (21.7 miles). The USGS earlier reported it as a 6.9.

The largest and first had a magnitude of 7.0 and occurred just over a half hour before. It was located 160 miles from Padang. The USGS initially reported the quake as a magnitude 7.2.

The 7.0 quake caused the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Oceanic%20and%20Atmospheric%20Administration"&gt;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&lt;/a&gt; (NOAA) to issue a local &lt;a href="w%3Atsunami"&gt;tsunami&lt;/a&gt; bulletin stating that small waves were generated with larger ones close to the quake's &lt;a href="w%3Aepicenter"&gt;epicenter&lt;/a&gt;.

A half dozen smaller quakes ranging from 5.0 to 6.0 have occurred in the same area since February 24.

So far, there are no reports of damage or injuries in any of the quakes.

There were 2 games played in the National Hockey League on February 25, 2008.

<h2>Game summaries</h2>

<h3>Philadelphia Flyers @ Buffalo Sabres</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3AJesse%20Boulerice"&gt;Jesse Boulerice&lt;/a&gt; made his return to the Flyers lineup after a 25 game suspension for cross checking &lt;a href="w%3AVancouver%20Canucks"&gt;Vancouver Canucks&lt;/a&gt; center &lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Kesler"&gt;Ryan Kesler&lt;/a&gt; in the head on October 10, 2007. &lt;a href="w%3ADerek%20Roy"&gt;Derek Roy&lt;/a&gt; started the scoring for Buffalo to give them a 1-0 lead. &lt;a href="w%3AClarke%20MacArthur"&gt;Clarke MacArthur&lt;/a&gt; scored 11 seconds later to give the Sabres a 2-0 lead. &lt;a href="w%3AJason%20Pominville"&gt;Jason Pominville&lt;/a&gt; gave the Sabres a three goal lead over the Flyers 14:16 into the first period. A goal by &lt;a href="w%3AJeff%20Carter"&gt;Jeff Carter&lt;/a&gt; put Philadelphia on the board 17 seconds later. &lt;a href="w%3AScott%20Hartnell"&gt;Scott Hartnell&lt;/a&gt; scored to make it a one goal game going into the first intermission. The score stayed that way until &lt;a href="w%3AR.J.%20Umberger"&gt;R.J. Umberger&lt;/a&gt; beat goaltender &lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Miller%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;Ryan Miller&lt;/a&gt; to tie the score and send it to a shootout. Former Sabre &lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Briere"&gt;Daniel Briere&lt;/a&gt; made the decisive shootout goal, giving the Flyers their first win since February 5.
<h3>Toronto Maple Leafs @ Ottawa Senators</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3AMats%20Sundin"&gt;Mats Sundin&lt;/a&gt; scored the first goal of the game for Toronto, just a day after announcing he would not waive his no-trade clause. In the second period, Toronto lit the lamp 4 times. First, &lt;a href="w%3ADarcy%20Tucker"&gt;Darcy Tucker&lt;/a&gt; scored a power play goal. Then, &lt;a href="w%3APavel%20Kubina"&gt;Pavel Kubina&lt;/a&gt; scored his 6th goal of the season. Tucker scored his second power play goal of the night moments later. &lt;a href="w%3ADominic%20Moore"&gt;Dominic Moore&lt;/a&gt; scored to give the Leafs a 5 goal lead against the Senators. &lt;a href="w%3AMatt%20Stajan"&gt;Matt Stajan&lt;/a&gt; and Tucker each had 3 points. &lt;a href="w%3AJason%20Blake"&gt;Jason Blake&lt;/a&gt; had a pair of assists for Toronto as well. &lt;a href="w%3AVesa%20Toskala"&gt;Vesa Toskala&lt;/a&gt; stopped all of Ottawa's 31 shots, and earned his third shutout. 
<h2>Other news</h2>

Forsberg played 12 seasons in the NHL, making his debut for the &lt;a href="w%3AQuebec%20Nordiques"&gt;Quebec Nordiques&lt;/a&gt; in 1994, and stayed with the franchise for 8 seasons after they became the Avalanche in 1995.

&lt;a href="w%3ADarren%20McCarty"&gt;Darren McCarty&lt;/a&gt; signed a 1 year contract with the &lt;a href="w%3ADetroit%20Red%20Wings"&gt;Detroit Red Wings&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>Video hosting website Stage6 to shut down</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Video%20hosting%20website%20Stage6%20to%20shut%20down&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; corporation &lt;a href="w%3ADivX%2C%20Inc."&gt;DivX, Inc.&lt;/a&gt; announced on Monday that it will shut its ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AStage6"&gt;Stage6&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ website that hosts videos made by users. The shutdown will take effect on February 28, 2008 and is because the firm no longer have the resources to keep it online.

"Why are we shutting the service down? Well, the short answer is that the continued operation of ♡❤Stage6♡❤ is a very expensive enterprise that requires an enormous amount of attention and resources that we are not in a position to continue to provide. There are a lot of other details involved, but at the end of the day it’s really as simple as that," said Tom, who is also known as 'Spinner' in the statement on the website and an employee of DivX, Inc. the &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Diego%2C%20California"&gt;San Diego&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;-based host of the webservice.

In October 2007, &lt;a href="w%3AUniversal%20Music%20Group"&gt;Universal Music Group&lt;/a&gt; filed a federal lawsuit against DivX, Inc. for copyright infringement after users posted hundreds of music videos on ♡❤Stage6♡❤.

Chief Executive Kevin Hell said in a statement: "By no longer expending resources on ♡❤Stage6♡❤, we sharpen our focus on creating a global standard for digital video."

Videos can no longer be uploaded, but will be able to be watched and downloaded until February 28. ♡❤Stage6♡❤ made its debut in 2006. It hosted movie clips, television shows and music videos along with content made by the site's users in the popular &lt;a href="w%3ADivX"&gt;DivX&lt;/a&gt; codec.

He continued, “We share a responsibility to protect our country. I get briefed every morning about threats we face, and they're real.”

There has been debate recently about the &lt;a href="w%3AProtect%20America%20Act"&gt;Protect America Act&lt;/a&gt;, which was discussed in the meeting. Referring to the Act in a recent radio address, the President said, “The Senate passed a good bill that would have given our intelligence professionals the tools they need to keep us safe. But leaders in the House of Representatives blocked a House vote on the Senate bill, and then left on a 10-day recess.”

On Saturday, in the State Dining Room after the meeting, Bush alluded to the challenges facing the U.S. “This is a different kind of struggle than we've ever faced before. It's essential that we understand the mentality of these killers. And so therefore we worked with Congress to protect — pass the Protect America Act, which everybody knows has expired.”

In &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; today, thousands of people joined a protest including 15 &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Labor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMember%20of%20Parliament"&gt;Members of Parliament&lt;/a&gt; about the State Government's plans to &lt;a href="w%3Aprivatisation"&gt;privatise&lt;/a&gt; the electricity industry.

The MPs included &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Gibson"&gt;Paul Gibson&lt;/a&gt;, Upper House president &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Primrose"&gt;Peter Primrose&lt;/a&gt;, and former MPs &lt;a href="w%3AKerry%20Hickey"&gt;Kerry Hickey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGrant%20McBride"&gt;Grant McBride&lt;/a&gt;.

Mr Gibson was reported as saying, "I'm a member of the Australian Labor Party and I'm sticking to the Labor platform and policy."

The Government seems to have ignored the positions of the protesters, with Premier &lt;a href="w%3AMorris%20Iemma"&gt;Morris Iemma&lt;/a&gt; expressing to the first sitting of Parliament for 2008 that his Government's plans would proceed.

<h1>Judge to decide on Nigerian election re-run</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Judge%20to%20decide%20on%20Nigerian%20election%20re-run&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
A result is expected today on the possibility of an election re-run in &lt;a href="w%3ANigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;. Opposition parties claim that current &lt;a href="w%3AUmaru%20Yar%27Adua"&gt;President Umaru Yar'Adua's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s_Democratic_Party_%28Nigeria%29"&gt;People's Democratic Party (PDP)&lt;/a&gt; fixed the results of the 2007 election in his favour and are calling to have the result annulled. So far, the tribunal has rejected one out of the two petitions calling for the annulment. 

International suspicions were also raised at the time, with some voicing concern over the election. 

A Nigerian judge is currently delivering the ruling on the case of granting the opposition parties a re-run, neither of which claim to have won the previous election. The decision could have negative impacts - if another election is called, it could be seen as an admittance of a 'false democracy' occurring in the last election and therefore undermining the political process in Nigeria. However, if no re-run of the election is called, it could cause instability between political rivals and may spark &lt;a href="w%3Aprotests"&gt;protests&lt;/a&gt;.

Emma Esau, of the Alliance for Credible elections, told the BBC: "We have faith the judges will give us a good ruling, and in any case we don't believe there will be violence after the decision is announced. This will not take Nigeria to the brink." 

Yar'Adua assumed office on 29th May 2007 after the election in April, where he won 70% of the vote. Since then, he has became the first Nigerian leader to declare his personal assets, as well as overturning hikes in petroleum and tax made by the previous government. Despite these positive steps, he has also been surrounded by controversy, with several governors who served him before 2007 being charged by the EFCC, the anti-corruption commission.

Election annulments have already been passed for seven of thirty-six state governors and even the senate president, David Mark.

A judge has ruled today that &lt;a href="w%3ANigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;'s 2007 election results, which saw &lt;a href="w%3AUmaru%20Yar%27Adua"&gt;Umaru Yar'Adua's&lt;/a&gt; become president, will not be annulled. Opposition parties claimed that the &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s_Democratic_Party_%28Nigeria%29"&gt;People's Democratic Party (PDP)&lt;/a&gt;, of which the President is leader, fixed the results of the 2007 election in his favour and called for a re-run.

The tribunal ruled unanimously against the claims, with Judge Abdulkadir Abubakar Jega stating that there was no evidence that Mr. Yar'Adua had rigged the polls. Muhammadu Buhari and Atiku Abubakar, leaders of the two opposition parties who launched the case, have both said they will take their complaints to the Supreme Court.

International suspicions were also raised at the time of the election, with some voicing concern over the politcal process. 

The ruling could have negative impacts - it could be seen as an admittance of a 'false democracy' occurring in the last election and therefore undermining the political process in Nigeria. This could cause instability between political rivals and may spark &lt;a href="w%3Aprotests"&gt;protests&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AFrank_Walker_%28Jersey_politician%29"&gt;Frank Walker&lt;/a&gt;, the chief minister of &lt;a href="w%3AJersey"&gt;Jersey&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACrown%20dependency"&gt;Crown dependency&lt;/a&gt; off the coast of &lt;a href="w%3ANormandy"&gt;Normandy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, denies that there was a cover up after a child's remains were found.

The allegations of a cover-up stem from statements by &lt;a href="w%3AStuart%20Syvret"&gt;Stuart Syvret&lt;/a&gt;. Syvret, the former Minister for Health and Social Services for Jersey, said that "It's a continuum that we see. It's a culture of cover-up and concealment and tragically the recent evidence is just the latest manifestation of that."

It has come to light that Edward Paisnel, a notorious &lt;a href="w%3Apedophilia"&gt;pedophile&lt;/a&gt;, used to visit the &lt;a href="w%3AHaut%20de%20la%20Garenne"&gt;Haut de la Garenne&lt;/a&gt; children's home dressed as &lt;a href="w%3AFather%20Christmas"&gt;Father Christmas&lt;/a&gt;. Paisnel in 1971, was given a sentence of 30 years for 13 counts of assault, rape and sodomy.

Syvret says he was dismissed from his ministerial position after highlighting the "torture" of 11 to 16-year-olds in the island's care homes. He claimed he was "sacked for whistleblowing".

Police are currently investigating twenty-seven cases of child abuse on the island and recently discovered the body of one child at a care home Haut de la Garenne in St. Martin, and with a potential six sites in the area where more bodies may be located. The home was closed in 1986 and since 2003 it has served as a &lt;a href="w%3Ahostel"&gt;youth hostel&lt;/a&gt;.

Jersey's deputy police chief, Lenny Harper said "Part of the inquiry will be the fact that a lot of the victims tried to report their assaults but for some reason or another they were not dealt with as they should be."

Harper added that "no evidence of a cover-up of any Jersey government" has been found. "We are looking at allegations that a number of agencies didn't deal with things as perhaps they should."

Syvret has encouraged the government of the United Kingdom to assign independent judges to oversee any cases that result from the investigations.

Builders originally uncovered a body at the care home in 2003 but it was only since an operation investigate child abuse started in 2006 that progress has been made. An ex-minister of the &lt;a href="w%3Astates_of_Jersey"&gt;States of Jersey&lt;/a&gt;, the parliament of the island, has criticised the handling of the case, stating that abuse cases were mishandled. 

Walker told senators that all necessary resources would be use to find the abusers. "None of us imagined that children in Jersey could be abused and mistreated in the way that is being suggested," the &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20News"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; have quoted him as saying. "I express my shock and horror that these things have apparently happened within our island."

Specialist police from the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; have been investigating after an enquiry turned up 140 sources verifying the claims of abuse.

Out of the 4.4 million customers served by &lt;a href="w%3AFlorida%20Power%20%26amp%3B%20Light"&gt;Florida Power &amp; Light, Co.&lt;/a&gt; (FPL), about 680,000 residents were affected, with an additional two million-plus customers affected in other parts of the state. It is estimated that as many as four million customers throughout Florida were affected, with many different power companies losing control of their specific grids. 

Power outages were reported as far south as the Florida Keys, on the original FPL grid, and as far north as &lt;a href="Orlando"&gt;Orlando&lt;/a&gt; and Daytona Beach, nearly   ( km) away on the &lt;a href="w%3AProgress%20Energy%20Inc"&gt;Progress Energy&lt;/a&gt; grid. Most of &lt;a href="w%3AMiami-Dade%20County%2C%20Florida"&gt;Miami-Dade&lt;/a&gt; and parts of &lt;a href="w%3ABroward%20County%2C%20Florida"&gt;Broward&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APalm%20Beach%20County%2C%20Florida"&gt;Palm Beach&lt;/a&gt; counties suffered the worst outages. 

FPL President Armando Olivera said that a disconnect switch failed at 1:08 p.m. at the automated substation west of Miami, and a piece of equipment that controls voltage caught fire about the same time. Neither failure by itself would have caused a widespread outage. The event at the utility's Flagami substation consequently led to the rolling blackouts. 

Originally the first failure was thought to have occurred at the utility's nuclear plant at &lt;a href="w%3ATurkey%20Point%20Nuclear%20Generating%20Station"&gt;Turkey Point&lt;/a&gt;. It is still unclear how failure at this site spread, but with power turning off at the main Turkey Point location, which serves all of south Florida, FPL's grid shut down as well. It contributed to a domino effect which ended up sapping energy from bordering grids all over Florida. 

Police reported several people were stuck in the elevators of high-rise buildings in downtown Miami and several hospitals were running on backup power, although no injuries or fatalities have been reported. The blackouts caused major traffic jams and a few accidents, but the original outage was contained shortly after it occurred. All customers affected had power restored to them by 6:30 p.m. (23:30 UTC).

<h1>Michael Jackson's Neverland Ranch to be auctioned off</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Michael%20Jackson%27s%20Neverland%20Ranch%20to%20be%20auctioned%20off&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3ANeverland%20Ranch"&gt;Neverland Valley Ranch&lt;/a&gt;, owned by &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Jackson"&gt;Michael Jackson&lt;/a&gt;, is to be sold at auction on March 19, 2008, unless Jackson pays over &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;24 million.

Financial Title Company, the trustee of his &lt;a href="w%3ASanta%20Barbara%20County%2C%20California"&gt;Santa Barbara County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, home and amusement park, has foreclosed on the property. They notified Jackson of the foreclosure and sale on Monday. Jackson had only just recently paid an overdue property tax bill of $600,000.

The court filing, addressed to Jackson, says, "You are in default of a deed of trust ... Unless you take action to protect your property it may be sold at a public sale." &lt;a href="w%3AFox%20News"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt; published the filing.

The foreclosure includes the ranch and all possessions on the property, inside or out.

The foreclosure auction will take place in front of the Santa Barbara County Courthouse in Santa Barbara. Jackson has until then to pay $24,525,906.61 he owes the title company.

In 2006, Jackson refinanced previous loans that had been bought up by &lt;a href="w%3AFortress%20Investment%20Group"&gt;Fortress Investment Group&lt;/a&gt;. The $300-million loan was secured with the aid of &lt;a href="w%3ASony%20Music%20Entertainment"&gt;Sony Music Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Neverland property was not part of that deal.

Jackson has not lived at Neverland since June 30, 2005, when he moved to &lt;a href="Bahrain"&gt;Bahrain&lt;/a&gt; after a rape charge and subsequent acquittal.

<h1>Seeds placed in Norwegian vault as agricultural 'insurance policy'</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Seeds%20placed%20in%20Norwegian%20vault%20as%20agricultural%20%27insurance%20policy%27&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The &lt;a href="w%3ASvalbard%20Global%20Seed%20Vault"&gt;Svalbard Global Seed Vault&lt;/a&gt;, a vault containing millions of seeds from all over the world, saw its first deposits on Tuesday. Located 800 kilometers from the &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Pole"&gt;North Pole&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="Norway"&gt;Norwegian&lt;/a&gt; island of &lt;a href="w%3ASpitsbergen"&gt;Spitsbergen&lt;/a&gt;, the vault has been referred to by &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Commission"&gt;European Commission&lt;/a&gt; president &lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9%20Manuel%20Barroso"&gt;José Manuel Barroso&lt;/a&gt; as a "frozen &lt;a href="w%3AGarden%20of%20Eden"&gt;Garden of Eden&lt;/a&gt;". It is intended to preserve crop supplies and secure biological diversity in the event of a worldwide disaster.

"The opening of the seed vault marks a historic turning point in safeguarding the world’s crop diversity," said Cary Fowler, executive director of the &lt;a href="w%3AGlobal%20Crop%20Diversity%20Trust"&gt;Global Crop Diversity Trust&lt;/a&gt; which is in charge of collecting the seed samples. The Norwegian government, who owns the bank, built it at a cost of $9.1 million. 

At the opening ceremony, 100 million seeds from 268,000 samples were placed inside the vault, where there is room for over 2 billion seeds. Each of the samples originated from a different farm or field, in order to best ensure biological diversity. These crop seeds included such staples as rice, potatoes, barley, lettuce, maize, sorghum, and wheat. No genetically modified crops were included. (Beyond politics they are generally sterile so of no use.)
Constructed deep inside a mountain and protected by concrete walls, the "doomsday vault" is designed to withstand earthquakes, nuclear warfare, and floods resulting from global warming. Norwegian Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJens%20Stoltenberg"&gt;Jens Stoltenberg&lt;/a&gt; called it an "insurance policy" against such threats.

With air-conditioned temperatures of -18 degrees Celsius, experts say the seeds could last for an entire millennium. Some crops will be able to last longer, like sorghum, which the Global Crop Diversity Trust says can last almost 20 millenniums. Even if the refrigeration system fails, the vaults are expected to stay frozen for 200 years.

The Prime Minister said, "With climate change and other forces threatening the diversity of life that sustains our planet, Norway is proud to be playing a central role in creating a facility capable of protecting what are not just seeds, but the fundamental building blocks of human civilization." Stoltenberg, along with &lt;a href="Kenya"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href="w%3ANobel%20Peace%20Prize"&gt;Nobel Peace Prize&lt;/a&gt; laureate &lt;a href="w%3AWangari%20Maathai"&gt;Wangari Maathai&lt;/a&gt;, made the first deposit of rice to the vault.

"It is very important for &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; to store seeds here because anything can happen to our national seed banks," Maathai said. The vault will operate as a bank, allowing countries to use their deposited seeds free of charge. It will also serve as a backup to the thousands of other seed banks around the world.

"Crop diversity will soon prove to be our most potent and indispensable resource for addressing climate change, water and energy supply constraints and for meeting the food needs of a growing population," Cary Fowler said.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
[Opening music] This is Wikinews News Brief, summarising the current news on Wednesday the 27th of February 2008 at 0430 hours UTC. I’m Nicholas Turnbull.

<h3>Events of worldwide notability, military action, disasters etc.</h3>

<h4>&lt;a href="Kenya%20peace%20talks%20put%20on%20hold"&gt;Kenya peace talks put on hold&lt;/a&gt;</h4>

In Kenya, discussions aiming to negotiate agreement between the ruling Party of National Unity and the opposing Orange Democratic Movement have been put on hold. The talks aimed to end violence caused in protests that have killed over 1,500 people since they began in December 2007. The talks between ruling president Mwai Kibaki and opposition leader Raila Odinga have been mediated by Kofi Annan, former head of the United Nations, who has stated that the talks have not broken down. Despite continued acrimony between the two political parties, it has been agreed that Odinga will be appointed to a newly-created post of Prime Minister, which is dependent on power sharing agreements being made.

<h4>&lt;a href="Jersey%20child%20abuse%20case%20%27was%20not%20covered%20up%27"&gt;Jersey child abuse case 'was not covered up'&lt;/a&gt;</h4>

Frank Walker, the Chief Minister of Jersey, has denied that a cover-up took place following the discovery of a child's remains during building work at the Haut de la Garenne children's home. Jersey has called in special police from the United Kingdom following an inquiry that located 140 sources verifying the claims of routine child abuse at the home. Stuart Syvret, the former Minister for Health and Social Services, spoke of a culture of cover-up and concealment within Jersey's government, and described the recent discovery as a manifestation of this culture. Syvret claims he was sacked from Jersey's cabinet after drawing attention to the abuse of children aged 11 to 16 in the island's care homes. The deputy police chief of Jersey, Lenny Harper, has stated that no evidence of a cover-up has been found, although added that allegations of government agencies not adequately handling reports of assault are currently being looked into. The investigation continues.

<h4>&lt;a href="Nigerian%20election%20result%20will%20not%20be%20annulled"&gt;Nigerian election result will not be annulled&lt;/a&gt;</h4>

In Nigeria, a judge ruled yesterday that the country's 2007 election results will not be annulled, despite claims by opposition parties that the incumbent People's Democratic Party fixed the election results, of which current president Umaru Yar'adua is leader. Judge Abdulkadir Abubaka Jega ruled that there was no evidence that the polls had been rigged. Opposition parties have both declared an intention to take the matter to the Supreme Court. Concerns were raised by the international community as to the legitimacy of the electoral process, and the recent ruling could potentially cause instability between political rivals and spark protests.

<h4>&lt;a href="Iraq%20demands%20immediate%20withdrawal%20of%20Turkish%20troops"&gt;Iraq demands immediate withdrawal of Turkish troops&lt;/a&gt;</h4>

The Iraqi government has demanded the immediate withdrawal of Turkish troops from Kurdish areas in the north of Iraq, describing the five-day incursion as threatening to otherwise cordial relations between the two countries. The Iraq Council of Ministers views the Turkish military as violating Iraq's sovereignty by the incursion. The Turkish forces entered Iraq in an attempt to force out Kurdish rebels from the Kurdistan Workers' Party, who have used bases inside Iraq to launch attacks on Turkish military forces. A spokesman for the Iraqi government acknowledged the threat posed to Turkey by the rebels, and affirmed that the government stands ready for dialogue. The president of the Iraqi parliament, Mahmoud al-Mashhadani, has asked the Turkish government to resolve the situation peacefully and suggests that Turkey should hold a referendum to grant the Kurdish population the rights that they desire.

<h3>Non-disastrous local events with notable impact and dead celebrities</h3>

<h4>&lt;a href="Massive%20blackouts%20hit%20Florida"&gt;Massive blackouts hit Florida&lt;/a&gt;</h4>

Florida has been hit by massive blackouts which occurred throughout the state at around on Tuesday afternoon, when two pieces of equipment at an automated substation west of Miami failed at the same time. Approximately 680,000 residents served by the Florida Power and Light Company were affected, with over two million others affected in other parts of the state. Outages were reported from the south in the Florida Keys to as far north as Orlando and Daytona Beach. The most severe loss of power was experienced in Miami-Dade, and parts of Broward and Palm Beach counties. Engineering work is in progress to restore power across the state.

<h4>&lt;a href="Thousands%20protest%20privatisation%20of%20Australian%20electricity%20industry"&gt;Thousands protest privatisation of Australian electricity industry&lt;/a&gt;</h4>

Thousands of people took part in a protest yesterday in New South Wales, Australia, against government plans to privatise the state's electricity industry. Members of parliament opposing the decision included Paul Gibson, Upper House president Peter Primrose, and former members Kerry Hickey and Grant McBride. The state government appears to be continuing with plans despite these protests, in which a related walk-out by members of the Electricity Trade Union took place in Tamworth.

<h4>&lt;a href="Pakistan%27s%20ban%20on%20YouTube%20lifted"&gt;Pakistan's ban on YouTube lifted&lt;/a&gt;</h4>

Pakistan has lifted its ban on the video-sharing website YouTube, which was allegedly implemented when a video that was deemed offensive to Islam was posted to the site. The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority stated that the offending material was related to a trailer for a film by Dutch politician Geert Wilders [pr: ghrart vildersh]. An order had been placed by the agency to the country's 70 internet service providers to block access to the site, and the subsequent actions undertaken by the providers mistakenly prevented access from international ISPs, preventing some users' accessing the site from outside Pakistan for approximately two hours. Wilders is expected to release a movie about violence in Islamic culture that has caused concern amongst United States security agencies regarding a possible worldwide surge of violence.

<h4>&lt;a href="Minor%20earthquake%20shakes%20England"&gt;Minor earthquake shakes England&lt;/a&gt;</h4>

The United Kingdom has experienced a minor earthquake of magnitude 4.9 today, at 00:56 hours UTC. The epicentre of the earthquake appears to be in the East Midlands Region at 15 miles north-east of Lincoln. Tremors were reported across a wide area of England, covering Manchester, Sheffield, Middlesbrough, Cambridge, London and Birmingham. No reports of damage or injury have been issued.

<h3>Business, commerce and academia</h3>

<h4>&lt;a href="Seeds%20placed%20in%20Norwegian%20vault%20as%20agricultural%20%27insurance%20policy%27"&gt;Seeds placed in Norwegian vault as agricultural 'insurance policy'&lt;/a&gt;</h4>

A vault located 800 kilometres from the North Pole on the Norwegian island of Spitsbergen, the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, received its first deposit of seeds on Tuesday. The vault is designed to contain millions of seeds from across the world, each sample originating from a different farm or field in order to ensure the best biological diversity. It is designed to withstand earthquakes, nuclear warfare and floods, and according to Norwegian prime minister Jens Stoltenberg it is intended to be an insurance policy against these disasters. The seeds, being stored at air-conditioned temperatures of minus 18 degrees Celsius, have been said by experts to be capable of remaining fertile for over a millennium.

<h4>&lt;a href="Michael%20Jackson%27s%20Neverland%20Ranch%20to%20be%20auctioned%20off"&gt;Michael Jackson's Neverland Ranch to be auctioned off&lt;/a&gt;</h4>
Michael Jackson's Neverland Valley Ranch is to be sold at auction on March the 19th this year unless Jackson repays debts to the trustee of the property of over $24 million US dollars. Financial Title Company, the trustee of Jackson's home and amusement park, has foreclosed on the property following a default on Jackson's deed of trust. The foreclosure auction will take place in front of the Santa Barbara Courthouse unless the money is repaid by the date of the auction. Jackson has not lived at Neverland since mid-2005, when he moved to Bahrain.

<h4>&lt;a href="Microsoft%20Network%20users%20experience%20international%20outage"&gt;Microsoft Network users experience international outage&lt;/a&gt;</h4>

Many users of Microsoft's live Internet services, including Hotmail, Windows Live Messenger and Xbox Live, have been reporting an inability to log in to their accounts on the network. Problems are said to have begun at around 6:30am eastern standard time yesterday. Microsoft made a statement to the press in which they assure customers that action is being taken to remedy the technical fault, although did not give an indication as to when the problem will be solved. The exact number of users affected by the issue is not known.

<h4>&lt;a href="Video%20hosting%20website%20Stage6%20to%20shut%20down"&gt;Video hosting website Stage6 to shut down&lt;/a&gt;</h4>
The popular video hosting website Stage6 is to be shut down by its American owner, DivX Inc., as a consequence of the company having insufficient resources to continue running the site. Universal Music Group filed a federal lawsuit in October last year against the company, alleging copyright infringement after hundreds of music videos were uploaded to the site. Stage6 has been operational since 2006, and hosted movie clips, television shows and music videos in addition to self-made content uploaded by individual users. Uploads to the site are now no longer possible, although existing videos will continue to be able to be watched and downloaded until tomorrow.

<h3>Arts and culture</h3>

<h4>&lt;a href="N.Y.%20orchestra%20helps%20forge%20relations%20with%20North%20Korea"&gt;N.Y. orchestra helps forge relations with North Korea&lt;/a&gt;</h4>
In Pyongyang, North Korea, the New York Philharmonic Orchestra performed at the East Pyongyang Grand Theatre in a televised concert aimed at improving relations between the Communist nation and the Western world. This unprecedented diplomatic gesture takes place at a time where tension between the United States and North Korea remains high, whilst a deal on the issue of nuclear disarmament continues to be negotiated between the two countries. The government of North Korea allowed access to the country for over 300 people and provided almost unrestricted Internet access and international telephone calls for the visitors, freedoms not generally granted by the Government's strict attempts at suppressing dissent.

The &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; was hit by a minor &lt;a href="w%3Aearthquake"&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt; on February 27, 2008 at 00:56:45 UTC. Tremors were reported as wide spread as &lt;a href="w%3AEdinburgh"&gt;Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AManchester"&gt;Manchester&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASheffield"&gt;Sheffield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMiddlesbrough"&gt;Middlesbrough&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACambridge"&gt;Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABirmingham"&gt;Birmingham&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASouthampton"&gt;Southampton&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3Aepicentre"&gt;epicentre&lt;/a&gt; appears to be in the &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Midlands"&gt;East Midlands&lt;/a&gt; region, 15 miles north-east of &lt;a href="w%3ALincoln%2C%20Lincolnshire"&gt;Lincoln&lt;/a&gt; co-ordinates 53.321°N, 0.314°W, with a magnitude of 4.9 according to the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre, 5.0 according to the GFZ Potsdam, 4.7 according to USGS, and 5.2 according to the British Geological Survey. 
As such it was similar or stronger than the 2002 earthquake centred on &lt;a href="w%3ADudley"&gt;Dudley&lt;/a&gt; which was recorded as being 4.8 and caused damage to buildings.

There was also an aftershock at about 0400 GMT reaching 1.8 on the Richter Scale. 

It has been reported that a number of buildings have been damaged and a man in &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Yorkshire"&gt;South Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt; suffered a broken pelvis caused by falling masonry.

Strong earthquakes are relatively infrequent occurrences in the UK, the last widely-reported quake having &lt;a href="Earthquake%20strikes%20Kent%2C%20England"&gt;occurred in Kent on April 28, 2007&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Geological%20Survey"&gt;British Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt; reported that ... ♡❤"earthquakes of this size occur in the mainland UK roughly every 30 years, although are more common in offshore areas"♡❤. They also reported that ... ♡❤"this is the largest earthquake in the UK since the magnitude 5.4 ML Lleyn Peninsula earthquake in 1984, which was widely felt across England and Wales."♡❤ &lt;a href="http%3A//www.bgs.ac.uk/news/Market_Rasen_Feb_27_2008_web.pdf"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

St. Louis, who outshot the Stars 28-21 through the game, only had two shots in the final period to Dallas's 7. &lt;a href="w%3AMarty%20Turco"&gt;Marty Turco&lt;/a&gt; gave up the first shot he saw, but stopped 27 shots after that to pick up his 29th win of the season.

&lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Gilbert"&gt;Tom Gilbert&lt;/a&gt; broke a scoreless tie in the second period to give Edmonton the first lead of the game. They would increase their lead to 2-0 early in the third when &lt;a href="w%3AGeoff%20Sanderson"&gt;Geoff Sanderson&lt;/a&gt; scored his third goal of the season. &lt;a href="w%3AJonathan%20Ericsson"&gt;Jonathan Ericsson&lt;/a&gt; scored his first career NHL goal on a Detroit power play to cut Edmonton's lead in half less than 4 minutes later. &lt;a href="w%3APavel%20Datsyuk"&gt;Pavel Datsyuk&lt;/a&gt; made it a tie game 12:18 into the third period. &lt;a href="w%3AValtteri%20Filppula"&gt;Valtteri Filppula&lt;/a&gt; gave Detroit their first lead of the game with 2:16 left in regulation, but &lt;a href="w%3AFernando%20Pisani"&gt;Fernando Pisani&lt;/a&gt; scored for Edmonton with 29 seconds left in regulation. &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Nilsson"&gt;Robert Nilsson&lt;/a&gt; scored the only shootout goal for Edmonton, giving the Oilers their second straight victory and the Red Wings their 9th loss in 10 games. &lt;a href="w%3AMathieu%20Garon"&gt;Mathieu Garon&lt;/a&gt; made 40 saves, earning his 21st win of the season for Edmonton.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=French%20president%20insults%20passerby%20at%20national%20agriculture%20convention&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The French president &lt;a href="w%3ANicolas%20Sarkozy"&gt;Nicolas Sarkozy&lt;/a&gt; insulted a passerby who refused to shake his hand at the national agricultural convention this weekend. After the visitor refused to shake Sarkozy's hand an exchange of insults followed which was captured on film and has become widely distributed on Internet and television. The incident, widely reported in French media, has not helped Sarkozy's already slumping popularity.

A transcript of the exchange in French:
<ul>
BULLET::::- Visitor : "Ah non, touche moi pas."
BULLET::::- Sarkozy : "Casse toi alors!"
BULLET::::- Visitor : "Tu me salis!"
BULLET::::- Sarkozy : "Casse toi alors pauvre con!"

</ul>
Which ♡❤♡literally♡❤♡ translates as:
<ul>
BULLET::::- Visitor : "Oh no, don't touch me."
BULLET::::- Sarkozy : "Go away then!"
BULLET::::- Visitor : "You dirty me!"
BULLET::::- Sarkozy : "Go away then poor cunt!"

</ul>
In the English speaking media, "pauvre con" has been variously translated as "total jerk", "arsehole", "dumb ass", "poor bastard", "poor cretin"... "" literally translates to "cunt" which in English is often interpreted as a very strong insult, whereas the French version is much milder and more often used.

In an interview published Tuesday in ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALe%20Parisien"&gt;Le Parisien&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, a major French newspaper, Sarkozy is reported as saying "it would have been better" if he had responded differently. According to the editor of ♡❤Le Parisien♡❤ however, Sarkozy had expressed no regret about the incident during the interview, the text concerning the altercation was inserted by the &lt;a href="w%3AElys%C3%A9e%20Palace"&gt;Elysée Palace&lt;/a&gt;, the official residence of the President of the French Republic, when they were allowed to review the article before publication.

A translation conveying the real meaning of the exchange would be:
<ul>
BULLET::::- Visitor : "Don't you touch me!"
BULLET::::- Sarkozy : "Bugger off, then..."
BULLET::::- Visitor : "You dirty me."
BULLET::::- Sarkozy : "Bugger off then, arsehole."

While it has taken almost a year, the non-profit &lt;a href="w%3AEncyclopedia%20of%20Life"&gt;Encyclopedia of Life&lt;/a&gt; project launched yesterday. It gained so much attention, that the site quickly crashed. It went back online Tuesday afternoon (&lt;a href="w%3Aeastern%20standard%20time"&gt;EST&lt;/a&gt;), but went down again the next morning.

During five-and-a-half hours, the site logged 11.5 million hits, including visitors who reached the "&lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20HTTP%20status%20codes%235xx%20Server%20Error"&gt;503 error&lt;/a&gt;".

EOL is estimated to have cost &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;110.5 million so far.

The site has limited information on 30,000 species, and full profiles of 25 species. These fleshed-out profiles include an article with scientific references, maps of where the species are found, and are illustrated with photos and video. One million placeholder pages have been set up so far, and the plan is to eventually catalog all 1.8 million species.

The &lt;a href="w%3AWikimedia%20Foundation"&gt;Wikimedia Foundation&lt;/a&gt; launched a similar project in August 2004, &lt;a href="w%3AWikispecies"&gt;Wikispecies&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps the least known of &lt;a href="Wikimedia"&gt;Wikimedia&lt;/a&gt; projects, it "was created to provide an open source forum for taxonomic and biological information." It has logged 120,247 species, under a free license. The US government runs an Integrated Taxonomic Information System, with 464,081 scientific names. It is created in partnership with similar Canadian and Mexican databases.

There is also a &lt;a href="w%3ATree%20of%20Life%20Web%20Project"&gt;Tree of Life Web Project&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="w%3ACatalogue%20of%20Life"&gt;Catalogue of Life&lt;/a&gt;, the latter being the most successful; it is a compilation of 1,008,965 species, from 47 taxonomical databases. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.zipcodezoo.com/"&gt;ZipcodeZoo&lt;/a&gt; offers descriptions of over 3 million species of plants and animals, with 250,000 photos, maps, pronunciations, and definitions in 13 languages. &lt;a href="w%3AARKive"&gt;ARKive&lt;/a&gt; collects media of species, and the &lt;a href="w%3AAll%20Species%20Foundation"&gt;All Species Foundation&lt;/a&gt; was a failed early attempt at a web catalog.

<h1>Sudan boycotts Danish goods</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Sudan%20boycotts%20Danish%20goods&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The country of &lt;a href="Sudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt; has initiated an official boycott of &lt;a href="Denmark"&gt;Danish&lt;/a&gt; products, after the controversial Muhammad cartoons have been reprinted by a series of newspapers in Denmark and other European countries. Yesterday, &lt;a href="w%3AOmar%20al-Bashir"&gt;President Omar al-Bashir&lt;/a&gt; expressed his concerns at a government-backed rally in the nation's capital, requesting that all Muslims in the world take a stand against Denmark by boycotting “businesses, institutions and individuals,” adding that “no Danes shall ever again be able to set foot in Sudan,” however, no Danish emergency workers in the country have yet been asked to leave.

The crisis, which appeared to have been averted two years ago after a near-omnipresent boycott of Danish goods in the Middle East and other Muslim countries, has re-surfaced after three men were apprehended earlier this month, charged with plotting to murder the cartoonist of what is considered the most offensive caricature, portraying the prophet Muhammad with a turban in the shape of a bomb on his head. Two of the men, both &lt;a href="Tunisia"&gt;Tunisia&lt;/a&gt;n citizens, have since been expelled from the country.

<h3>Considering dropping financial backing</h3>

Several Danish politicians have openly suggested dropping the development aid offered to Sudan. The Danish Minister of Development understands the concerns expressed by party associates and states that she cannot promise not to take action. The strongly-nationalist party, the &lt;a href="w%3ADanish%20People%27s%20Party"&gt;Danish People's Party&lt;/a&gt;, has stated that any financial support to the country should cease immediately. Other politicians, especially members of the opposition &lt;a href="w%3ASocial%20Democrats%20%28Denmark%29"&gt;social democratic party&lt;/a&gt; believe that removing the financial support to Sudan will only hurt the refugees in the &lt;a href="Darfur"&gt;Darfur&lt;/a&gt; and other poor regions of the country, rather than the government and people of the capital, &lt;a href="w%3AKhartoum"&gt;Khartoum&lt;/a&gt;.

In addition, the Danish Minister of Foreign Affairs, &lt;a href="w%3APer%20Stig%20M%C3%B8ller"&gt;Per Stig Møller&lt;/a&gt;, has also stated, that Sudanese government might want to reconsider their methods, if they wish to become members of the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Trade%20Organization"&gt;World Trade Organization&lt;/a&gt;, which the nation has previously stated its interests in. The organisation does not permit consumer boycotts of other countries by its members.

Since the cartoons were published by 17 Danish newspapers earlier this month&amp;mdash;along with a number of foreign ones&amp;mdash;there have been demonstrations and attacks on Danish embassies and consulates in &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Jordan"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;.

The Sudanese boycotts and demonstrations throughout the Muslim world have already claimed the first jobs at &lt;a href="w%3AArla%20Foods"&gt;Arla&lt;/a&gt;, the main Danish provider of dairy products, who has seen itself forced to fire 8&amp;ndash;10 employees due to lowered demand.

A school located in &lt;a href="w%3AEdinburgh%2C%20Scotland"&gt;Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Scotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; was sealed off on Wednesday night after reports of several packages containing radioactive materials were found on the school grounds. Reports say that the packages, in one box, were marked as &lt;a href="w%3Aplutonium"&gt;plutonium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Aradium"&gt;radium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Astrontium"&gt;strontium&lt;/a&gt;. The packages were later discovered to be just low risk material used in regular school experiments and the alert was called off.

The areas surrounding the Regent Language Training School were sealed off as officials investigated the packages.

Emergency services were called after someone cleaning cabinets found the packages, which were marked as being radioactive. Fire officials believe that the boxes were likely inside cabinets for several years.

"We do know they had been there for a considerable time. Somebody discovered them as they were cleaning out a cupboard. The discovery was made earlier this evening," said Lothian and Borders Fire and Rescue Service manager, Jim Fraser who also stated that "There's no intelligence to suggest anything bad. There are signs on the packages suggesting that they contain radioactive materials, but most schools have these sorts of materials for chemistry experiments and that sort of thing and it's really, really low risk."

There were no students inside the building and no evacuations have been made at this time, but it is not yet known exactly how many people were inside the school when officials responded.

<h2>Game summaries</h2>

<h3>Nashville Predators @ Buffalo Sabres</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Bernier"&gt;Steve Bernier&lt;/a&gt; made his debut for the Sabres, scoring the first two goals of the game in the first period. In the second period, &lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Paille"&gt;Daniel Paille&lt;/a&gt; put Buffalo ahead by 3. &lt;a href="w%3AJan%20Hlavac"&gt;Jan Hlavac&lt;/a&gt; put Nashville on the board 45 seconds later. Nashville came within one goal 34 seconds later when &lt;a href="w%3AJason%20Arnott"&gt;Jason Arnott&lt;/a&gt; scored his 23rd goal of the year. &lt;a href="w%3AAndrew%20Peters"&gt;Andrew Peters&lt;/a&gt; got that one back for Buffalo, when he scored his first goal of the season. Arnott made it a 1 goal game again with his second goal of the game on a Predators power play. &lt;a href="w%3AJason%20Pominville"&gt;Jason Pominville&lt;/a&gt; scored his 19th goal of the season at 14:50 in the second period. &lt;a href="w%3ADerek%20Roy"&gt;Derek Roy&lt;/a&gt; put the Sabres up by 3 going into the second intermission. In the third period, &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Legwand"&gt;David Legwand&lt;/a&gt; scored Nashville's second power play goal. &lt;a href="w%3ATim%20Connelly"&gt;Tim Connelly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAles%20Kotalik"&gt;Ales Kotalik&lt;/a&gt; each scored for Buffalo in the third period, giving the Sabres their first win in three games. &lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Miller%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;Ryan Miller&lt;/a&gt; left the game in the second period after a puck hit his mask and bent the guard, giving him a bloody nose. He returned 8 minutes later. Miller made 24 saves.
<h3>San Jose Sharks @ Columbus Blue Jackets</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3AJonathan%20Cheechoo"&gt;Jonathan Cheechoo&lt;/a&gt; scored on the Sharks' first power play to give them the first lead of the game. Columbus tied the game before the end of the first period when &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Vyborny"&gt;David Vyborny&lt;/a&gt; scored his 4th goal of the season. In the second period, Vyborny scored his second goal of the night to give Columbus their first lead of the game. It wouldn't last though, as San Jose put three goals past the Blue Jackets goaltender &lt;a href="w%3APascal%20Leclaire"&gt;Pascal Leclaire&lt;/a&gt;. First, &lt;a href="w%3ATorrey%20Mitchell"&gt;Torrey Mitchell&lt;/a&gt; tied the score at 10:51. &lt;a href="w%3AJeremy%20Roenick"&gt;Jeremy Roenick&lt;/a&gt; put the Sharks back in the lead with a power play goal. &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Pavelski"&gt;Joe Pavelski&lt;/a&gt; put San Jose up by two goals before the second period ended. &lt;a href="w%3AEvgeni%20Nabokov"&gt;Evgeni Nabokov&lt;/a&gt; stopped all but two of Columbus's 19 shots on the night, picking up his 35th win of the season.
<h3>Minnesota Wild @ Tampa Bay Lightning</h3>

After a scoreless first period, &lt;a href="w%3ATodd%20Fedoruk"&gt;Todd Fedoruk&lt;/a&gt; put the Wild up by 1 early in the second period with a short handed goal. That was closely followed by &lt;a href="w%3APavol%20Demitra"&gt;Pavol Demitra&lt;/a&gt;'s 13th goal of the season. &lt;a href="w%3AMichel%20Ouellet"&gt;Michel Ouellet&lt;/a&gt; put the Lightning on the scoreboard 12:22 into the second period. &lt;a href="w%3ABrian%20Rolston"&gt;Brian Rolston&lt;/a&gt; scored his 22nd goal of the season on a Minnesota power play to put Minnesota up by 2 in the third period. &lt;a href="w%3AJeff%20Halpern"&gt;Jeff Halpern&lt;/a&gt; would put the Lightning within 1 goal, but despite a late third period power play, plus the extra skater on for the pulled goaltender, they couldn't tie the score. Minnesota breaks a 4 game losing streak. The Lightning have now lost 5 straight. &lt;a href="w%3ANiklas%20Backstrom"&gt;Niklas Backstrom&lt;/a&gt; made 31 saves for Minnesota, earning his 25th win of the season.
<h3>Toronto Maple Leafs @ Florida Panthers</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3AJassen%20Cullimore"&gt;Jassen Cullimore&lt;/a&gt; scored first for the Panthers at 9:27 in the first period. &lt;a href="w%3ABrett%20McLean"&gt;Brett McLean&lt;/a&gt; would give Florida a 2 goal lead going into the first intermission. &lt;a href="w%3AJeremy%20Williams%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;Jeremy Williams&lt;/a&gt;, who had a goal in each of his other two NHL appearances, scored his first goal of this season 6:56 into the second period to put Toronto within one goal. In the third period, Toronto captain &lt;a href="w%3AMats%20Sundin"&gt;Mats Sundin&lt;/a&gt; scored to tie the game at 2-2. Rostislav Olesz would retake the lead for Florida 11:45 into the third, but Sundin scored his second of the night with 1:08 left in regulation to send the game to a shootout. &lt;a href="w%3ATomas%20Kaberle"&gt;Tomas Kaberle&lt;/a&gt; scored the only shootout goal, when his wrist shot beat &lt;a href="w%3ATomas%20Vokoun"&gt;Tomas Vokoun&lt;/a&gt; through the five-hole. &lt;a href="w%3AVesa%20Toskala"&gt;Vesa Toskala&lt;/a&gt; made 37 saves for the Leafs.
<h3>Phoenix Coyotes @ Chicago Blackhawks</h3>

Chicago's &lt;a href="w%3AJason%20Williams"&gt;Jason Williams&lt;/a&gt; scored the only goal of the game, a shot that deflected off of Coyotes center &lt;a href="w%3AJoel%20Perrault"&gt;Joel Perrault&lt;/a&gt;'s skate, 7:58 into the first period. &lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Lalime"&gt;Patrick Lalime&lt;/a&gt; stopped all of Phoenix's 32 shots, earning his first shutout since February 7, 2007. &lt;a href="w%3AIlya%20Bryzgalov"&gt;Ilya Bryzgalov&lt;/a&gt; only allowed 1 of Chicago's 24 shots, but the one allowed turned out to be the game winner.
<h3>Colorado Avalanche @ Vancouver Canucks</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3AMason%20Raymond"&gt;Mason Raymond&lt;/a&gt; put Vancouver on the board after a scoreless 1st period. Later in the second period, &lt;a href="w%3AAndrew%20Brunette"&gt;Andrew Brunette&lt;/a&gt; scored his 13th goal of the season to tie the score 1-1. In the third period, &lt;a href="w%3AAlex%20Burrows"&gt;Alex Burrows&lt;/a&gt; scored on a goal with 1:45 left in regulation, a goal that was allowed after a video review was done to verify that the puck completely crossed the goal line. &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Sakic"&gt;Joe Sakic&lt;/a&gt; tied the score with 15 seconds left to send the game into a shootout. Sakic and &lt;a href="w%3AMarek%20Svatos"&gt;Marek Svatos&lt;/a&gt; each scored on the shootout, giving Colorado their second consecutive win. &lt;a href="w%3AJose%20Theodore"&gt;Jose Theodore&lt;/a&gt; stopped 29 of Vancouver's 31 shots. &lt;a href="w%3ARoberto%20Luongo"&gt;Roberto Luongo&lt;/a&gt; stopped 24 of Colorado's 26 shots.
<h2>Wikinews Player of the Day</h2>

Today's Wikinews Player of the Day is Joe Sakic, captain of the Colorado Avalanche, who returned to the Avs roster on February 24 after missing 36 games due to a hernia. Sakic scored the tying goal to force overtime, and the decisive shootout goal, in the Avalanche's 3-2 shootout win against the Vancouver Canucks.

Murray, who was head coach of the Senators from 2005-2007, will take over the responsibilities of head coach.

&lt;a href="w%3AThaksin%20Shinawatra"&gt;Thaksin Shinawatra&lt;/a&gt;, the former &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Thailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;, has returned to his country after being deposed 17 months ago in a military &lt;a href="w%3Acoup%20d%27%C3%A9tat"&gt;coup d'état&lt;/a&gt;. Within minutes of landing in &lt;a href="w%3ABangkok"&gt;Bangkok&lt;/a&gt;, he was arrested on corruption charges by immigration police, though Thaksin proclaims his innocence, stating that the charges against him are politically motivated. He has been granted bail for 8 million baht (£132,000/$261,000/€173,000) and was ordered not to leave the country.

Thousands of his supporters gathered at the airport to welcome him back to Thailand. 

"When the game is over, we must come together and settle our differences, forgive everything and help each other push the country forward," the Guardian have reported him as saying. "I can prove my innocence. The allegations are empty."

In 2006 Thaksin was forcefully removed from office by the military who "cancelled the upcoming elections, suspended the Constitution, dissolved Parliament, banned protests and all political activities, suppressed and censored the media, declared martial law, and arrested Cabinet members," according to Wikipedia.

During the coup, Thaksin's &lt;a href="w%3AThai%20Rak%20Thai"&gt;Thai Rak Thai&lt;/a&gt; party was outlawed and senior members were banned from politics for 5 years. However, his political opponents in Thailand fear that, now he has returned, he may influence politics from behind-the-scenes.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAviator"&gt;pilot&lt;/a&gt; of the which crashed on March 7 upon landing at &lt;a href="w%3AYogyakarta%20Airport"&gt;Yogyakarta Airport&lt;/a&gt; after a domestic &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;n flight, has been forced by his airline to resign. The crash of &lt;a href="w%3AGaruda%20Indonesia"&gt;Garuda Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGaruda%20Indonesia%20Flight%20200"&gt;Flight 200&lt;/a&gt; killed twenty-one people, most being Indonesian nationals and five being &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;ns, following a visit by then Australian Foreign Minister &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Downer"&gt;Alexander Downer&lt;/a&gt;.

Garuda sent the pilot, Marwoto Komar, an ultimatum requesting his resignation with which he complied. Had he failed to do so, his employment would have been terminated. The news coincides with police officials forwarding to prosecutors some documents recommending that Komar be charged with negligent manslaughter over the crash, which carries a maximum sentence of seven years imprisonment.

The final report into the disaster found that Mr Komar ignored fifteen activations of the &lt;a href="w%3AGround%20Proximity%20Warning%20System"&gt;Ground Proximity Warning System&lt;/a&gt; informing him he was attempting to land too fast. After touching down at double the maximum safe speed, the aircraft overshot the runway and caught fire.

Kamal Firdaus, legal representative of Mr Komar, said "We regret Garuda so soon giving Marwoto the option of being fired or resigning." 

Mr Komar was arrested early this month, but was subsequently released on bail on February 15. He is thought to be the first pilot to face prosecution for an &lt;a href="w%3Aaviation%20accidents%20and%20incidents"&gt;aviation accident or incident&lt;/a&gt; in Indonesia.

The &lt;a href="American%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union"&gt;American Civil Liberties Union&lt;/a&gt; (ACLU) and the &lt;a href="Electronic%20Frontier%20Foundation"&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation&lt;/a&gt; (EFF) have sided with ♡❤&lt;a href="Wikileaks"&gt;Wikileaks.org&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and will defend them against a lawsuit which took the site off line in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. Wikileaks is a website dedicated to hosting leaked documents that are "anonymous, untraceable, uncensorable."

On February 18, 2008, a permanent court injunction issued in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Northern%20District%20of%20California"&gt;California Northern District Court&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;a href="San%20Francisco%2C%20California"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; by judge Jeffrey White, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; to Bank Julius Baer (BJB), a Swiss Bank, took the domain name offline. However the site remained online via its IP address and alternative domain names. Wikileaks previously published hundreds of documents obtained from a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Awhistleblower"&gt;whistleblower&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the Swiss Bank, "purportedly showing offshore tax evasion and money laundering by extremely wealthy and in some cases, politically sensitive, clients from the US, Europe, China and Peru."

"Blocking access to the entire site in response to a few documents posted there completely disregards the public's right to know," said Ann Brick a lawyer for the ACLU. At least 18 other organizations have signed documents in defense of Wikileaks. Those documents have been forged into a 'joint Amici Curiae ("friends of the Court") brief; which will be submitted to the court and used as defense evidence in a hearing scheduled for Friday February 29.

Despite the attempts by the ACLU and others, Bank Julius Baer says that their lawsuit has nothing to do with the rights of free speech.

"This action has been brought solely to prevent the unlawful dissemination of stolen bank records and personal account information of its customers. Many of those documents have also been altered and forged," said the Bank.

Recently the Bank has made allegations that they have been "unable to negotiate with Wikileaks" at all before or during legal proceedings. Wikileaks, in a press release denies the allegations.

"Wikileaks at all times responded with grace and dignity to BJBs highly irregular demands and left communication open," said Wikileaks which also adds that the correspondence with the Bank is available on its website on servers in &lt;a href="Denmark"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt;. "BJB did not submit the correspondence to
the court, although it must be absolutely central to the issues held there. We wonder why?"

<h3>Pittsburgh Penguins @ Boston Bruins</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3AMarco%20Sturm"&gt;Marco Sturm&lt;/a&gt; scored a pair of goals in the first period to put Boston at a 2-0 lead. In the second period, &lt;a href="w%3AZdeno%20Chara"&gt;Zdeno Chara&lt;/a&gt; scored at 2:21 to put the Bruins ahead by 3. &lt;a href="w%3APer%20Johan%20Axelsson"&gt;Per Johan Axelsson&lt;/a&gt; gave Boston a 4 goal lead heading into the second intermission. The newly acquired &lt;a href="w%3APascal%20Dupuis"&gt;Pascal Dupuis&lt;/a&gt; scored his first goal as a Penguin to put Pittsburgh on the board at 13:03 in the third period. Boston would retake a 4 goal lead before the game ended with &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Krejci"&gt;David Krejci&lt;/a&gt;'s power play goal. &lt;a href="w%3ATim%20Thomas%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;Tim Thomas&lt;/a&gt; made 27 saves for Boston, and increased his record to 23-14-4. &lt;a href="w%3AMarian%20Hossa"&gt;Marian Hossa&lt;/a&gt;, another new addition to the Pittsburgh roster, left the game in the second period after a knee-on-knee collision with &lt;a href="w%3AGlen%20Murray"&gt;Glen Murray&lt;/a&gt;.
<h3>Ottawa Senators @ Philadelphia Flyers</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3AJason%20Spezza"&gt;Jason Spezza&lt;/a&gt; scored first for Ottawa on their second power play, breaking the scoreless tie at 6:33 in the second period. After the goal, Spezza &lt;a href="w%3APenalty%20%28ice%20hockey%29%23List%20of%20infractions"&gt;butt-ended&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABraydon%20Coburn"&gt;Braydon Coburn&lt;/a&gt; with his stick during some post-goal roughhousing, resulting in Spezza being ejected from the game. &lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Dowd%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;Jim Dowd&lt;/a&gt; scored to put Philly on the board later in the period. In the third, the Flyers took their first lead of the game when &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Knuble"&gt;Mike Knuble&lt;/a&gt; scored a pair of goals, the second being a power play goal. &lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20Biron"&gt;Martin Biron&lt;/a&gt; made 32 saves, earning his 23rd win of the season.
<h3>New York Rangers @ Carolina Hurricanes</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3ABrandon%20Dubinsky"&gt;Brandon Dubinsky&lt;/a&gt; put the Rangers on the board at 3:50 in the first period with his 13th goal of the season. &lt;a href="w%3ASean%20Avery"&gt;Sean Avery&lt;/a&gt; also scored in the first period with 44 seconds left to give New York a two goal lead. &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Drury"&gt;Chris Drury&lt;/a&gt; had a goal 2:14 into the second period. &lt;a href="w%3AErik%20Cole"&gt;Erik Cole&lt;/a&gt; put the Hurricanes on the board before the halfway point of the second. Carolina came within one goal, when Cole scored his second of the night on the team's 4 minute power play in the third period, but &lt;a href="w%3ABrendan%20Shanahan"&gt;Brendan Shanahan&lt;/a&gt; would put the blue shirts back up by 2 a few minutes later. &lt;a href="w%3AHenrik%20Lundqvist"&gt;Henrik Lundqvist&lt;/a&gt; stopped 26 of Carolina's 28 shots, picking up his third straight win.
<h3>New York Islanders @ Atlanta Thrashers</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Comrie"&gt;Mike Comrie&lt;/a&gt; gave New York the first goal of the game 9:15 into the first period. Just over two minutes later, &lt;a href="w%3AJosef%20Vasicek"&gt;Josef Vasicek&lt;/a&gt; put the Islanders up by 2 with his 14th goal of the season. &lt;a href="w%3AAndy%20Hilbert"&gt;Andy Hilbert&lt;/a&gt; scored to put the Islanders up by 3. &lt;a href="w%3AEric%20Perrin"&gt;Eric Perrin&lt;/a&gt; scored on a penalty shot to put Atlanta on the board. Then, &lt;a href="w%3AKen%20Klee"&gt;Ken Klee&lt;/a&gt;, who was assisted by the newest Thrasher &lt;a href="w%3AColby%20Armstrong"&gt;Colby Armstrong&lt;/a&gt;, scored his first of the season to put the Thrashers within 1. Atlanta tied it up when &lt;a href="w%3AAlexei%20Zhitnik"&gt;Alexei Zhitnik&lt;/a&gt; scored 1:14 later. The Islanders retook the lead when Comrie scored his second goal of the night 3:17 into the third period, but Atlanta would force overtime when &lt;a href="w%3ABobby%20Holik"&gt;Bobby Holik&lt;/a&gt; scored with 1:22 left in regulation. &lt;a href="w%3ATrent%20Hunter"&gt;Trent Hunter&lt;/a&gt; won it for the Islanders 1:09 into the sudden death overtime, giving the Thrashers their fifth straight loss.
<h3>Phoenix Coyotes @ St. Louis Blues</h3>

The Blues took the first lead of the game when &lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Johnson%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;Ryan Johnson&lt;/a&gt; scored 15:13 into the first period. Ed Jovanovski scored on a Coyotes 5-on-3 power play a couple minutes later to tie the game. While still on a 5-on-4 power play, &lt;a href="w%3ANiko%20Kapanen"&gt;Niko Kapanen&lt;/a&gt; scored on a deflection from &lt;a href="w%3AKeith%20Yandle"&gt;Keith Yandle&lt;/a&gt; to give Phoenix their first, and only, lead of the game. The one goal lead would hold through the next two periods, as the Coyotes sweep the season series against St. Louis, and give the Blues their 5th straight loss. &lt;a href="w%3AIlya%20Bryzgalov"&gt;Ilya Bryzgalov&lt;/a&gt; made 41 saves, earning his 25th win of the season.
<h3>Chicago Blackhawks @ Dallas Stars</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3ADustin%20Byfuglien"&gt;Dustin Byfuglien&lt;/a&gt; put Chicago on the board first when he scored a power play 4:08 into the game. The Stars responded less than a minute later when &lt;a href="w%3ANiklas%20Hagman"&gt;Niklas Hagman&lt;/a&gt; scored his 23rd goal of the season. &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Modano"&gt;Mike Modano&lt;/a&gt; gave Dallas their first lead of the game just before the halfway point of the first period. Hagman scored his second of the night 2:47 into the second period. &lt;a href="w%3ALoui%20Eriksson"&gt;Loui Eriksson&lt;/a&gt; put Dallas ahead by 3 less than two minutes later. &lt;a href="w%3ATrevor%20Daley"&gt;Trevor Daley&lt;/a&gt; put a goal past &lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Lalime"&gt;Patrick Lalime&lt;/a&gt;, which was the last shot he faced of the night, as he was replaced by &lt;a href="w%3ACorey%20Crawford"&gt;Corey Crawford&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3ARene%20Bourque"&gt;Rene Bourque&lt;/a&gt; scored his first of two short handed goals of the night for the Blackhawks, but Hagman would complete the hat trick moments later. &lt;a href="w%3AAndrew%20Ladd"&gt;Andrew Ladd&lt;/a&gt; put Chicago back within 3 goals with over 10 minutes left in the game, but &lt;a href="w%3AJere%20Lehtinen"&gt;Jere Lehtinen&lt;/a&gt; would retake a 4 goal lead for the Stars, his 12th goal of the year. Bourque scored his second short handed goal of the night with 1:45 left. The Stars win their 4th straight. &lt;a href="w%3ABrad%20Richards"&gt;Brad Richards&lt;/a&gt; assisted in 5 goals in his Stars debut.
<h3>Los Angeles Kings @ Edmonton Oilers</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3AAndrew%20Cogliano"&gt;Andrew Cogliano&lt;/a&gt; put Edmonton on the board first 47 seconds into the game. &lt;a href="w%3AAnze%20Kopitar"&gt;Anze Kopitar&lt;/a&gt; tied the score with 6 seconds remaining in the first period. &lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20O%27Sullivan%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;Patrick O'Sullivan&lt;/a&gt; scored his 17th goal of the season to give Los Angeles their first lead of the game. &lt;a href="w%3AAles%20Hemsky"&gt;Ales Hemsky&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Nilsson"&gt;Robert Nilsson&lt;/a&gt; scored a pair of goals about a minute apart to jump into the lead. Just 57 seconds later, Los Angeles retied the game when &lt;a href="w%3ADustin%20Brown"&gt;Dustin Brown&lt;/a&gt; scored his 27th goal of the season. Hemsky scored his second of the night to retake the lead for the Oilers, and &lt;a href="w%3AFernando%20Pisani"&gt;Fernando Pisani&lt;/a&gt; would cushion their lead with two minutes left in the second period. Brown scored short handed to put Los Angeles within 1 with 9:47 left in the game, but the former King &lt;a href="w%3AMathieu%20Garon"&gt;Mathieu Garon&lt;/a&gt; would preserve the lead for Edmonton. The Oilers win their third straight game, and finish the season series tied with Los Angeles, 2 games a piece.

<h1>Crude oil price reaches new high</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Crude%20oil%20price%20reaches%20new%20high&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;a href="w%3APetroleum"&gt;Crude oil&lt;/a&gt; prices in &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; rose to a new record of &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;102.59 per barrel on Thursday, although the figure increased even more during after hours trading. In less than a month, prices have risen $10, leading the inflation adjusted prices above the record highs set during the 1980s. Information provided by the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Energy%20Agency"&gt;International Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt; has said that the previous record was $102.53, with the figures being adjusted according to inflation levels.

While the weak dollar is seen as a major cause of this rise, Congressman &lt;a href="Ron%20Paul"&gt;Ron Paul&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, pointed out to Federal Reserve chairman &lt;a href="w%3ABen%20Bernanke"&gt;Ben Bernanke&lt;/a&gt; in a committee meeting this week that despite the rapid ascent the of price of oil, it had remained flat when compared to the price of gold.

Increasing demand for oil has also been cited as the cause for this increase. Violence in &lt;a href="Nigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year has led to a drop the country's production by almost a quarter. The most recent information produced by the &lt;a href="w%3AEnergy%20Information%20Administration"&gt;Energy Information Administration&lt;/a&gt; has shown an increase in gasoline prices for all but one of the areas surveyed.

There have also been suggestions that reports of a fire at a National Gas Terminal may have contributed to the rising oil price. Tim Evans from &lt;a href="w%3ACitigroup"&gt;Citigroup Futures&lt;/a&gt; said he believes "that this fire at the UK natural gas terminal is creating a strong push in the European market, and that is translating here [the US]."

Applications have not only come from &lt;a href="Asia"&gt;Asian&lt;/a&gt; countries, but also from &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; and North America. Asia accounted for 35% of all applications with Europe and North America taking 40% and 24% respectively.

According to the DotAsia Organization, global application on launch were approximately 266,700. Currently Dotalliance Inc. &amp; EuroDNS S.A. are the top two registrars.

With the "♡❤.asia♡❤" domain having become notable, many more applications are expected before the closing date of March 12.

On February 14, a man staying at the Valley View &lt;a href="w%3AExtended%20Stay%20America"&gt;Extended Stay America&lt;/a&gt; hotel in &lt;a href="w%3ALas%20Vegas%2C%20Nevada"&gt;Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Nevada"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt; was hospitalized after experiencing respiratory distress. The man lapsed into unconsciousness and has been at the hospital ever since.

Since the bills at the hotel were going unpaid, Extended Stay America began to evict the man from the room. Another man, described as either a friend or relative, went to the hotel on Thursday to collect the personal belongings of the hospitalized man.

According to &lt;a href="w%3ALas%20Vegas%20Metropolitan%20Police%20Department"&gt;Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department&lt;/a&gt; Deputy Chief Kathy Suey, he found several vials of a white substance. He brought them to the attention of the hotel manager, who called police.

Initial tests, which further tests confirmed on Friday, the substance was the deadly toxin &lt;a href="w%3Aricin"&gt;ricin&lt;/a&gt;, an extremely dangerous biological agent. Ricin is extracted from &lt;a href="w%3Acastor%20oil%20plant"&gt;castor beans&lt;/a&gt; through the waste produced in the manufacture of &lt;a href="w%3Acastor%20oil"&gt;castor oil&lt;/a&gt;. It is currently being used in cancer treatment research. There has been research for its use as a chemical/biological warfare agent. An amount smaller than the point of a pin will kill a human being. It is estimated to be several thousand times more toxic than &lt;a href="w%3Acyanide"&gt;cyanide&lt;/a&gt; and there is no known &lt;a href="w%3Aantidote"&gt;antidote&lt;/a&gt;.

Police cordoned off the area around Valley View between Flamingo Road and Harmon Avenue. Three employees and the man who made the discovery were taken to the hospital as a precaution. So were three police officers. They are all reported to show no signs of poisoning.

&lt;a href="w%3ANevada%20National%20Guard"&gt;Nevada National Guard&lt;/a&gt; and other emergency services responded to secure the area. Residents at the Extended Stay America were allowed back into the building late Thursday. The hotel reopened fully on Friday after the room and other areas of the hotel were decontaminated.

The man whose room it was "is in critical condition and he is unable to speak with us right now. We have no indication why the ricin was in that room," said Deputy Chief Suey.

"Usually, if [ricin victims] survive the first three to five days, they usually do fine," Dr. Lawrence Sands told &lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;. However, survivors often have long-term organ damage.

At least three pets were found in the room. "Two of those pets are fine. One of the pets is deceased or was put down," Suey said. "The dog that was in there was without food and water for a week," she added that there was no reason to supect it was exposed to ricin. Castor beans were also found in the room.

Officials have also recovered from the room a firearm, as well as an "anarchist" text containing an article on ricin.

&lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation"&gt;Federal Bureau of Investigation&lt;/a&gt; spokesperson Richard Kolko said the incident is being treated as a criminal matter and did not appear to be related to terrorism "based on the information gathered so far."

Captain Joe Lombardo of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said that ricin is not illegal to own unless it is intended for the poisoning of a person, adding that "We did have enough ricin to be of concern."

In 2003, a man committed suicide in Las Vegas using ricin. There have also been a few incidents where ricin powder was found in the mail. Also in 2003, the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; had the &lt;a href="w%3AWood%20Green%20ricin%20plot"&gt;Wood Green ricin plot&lt;/a&gt; which in the end found no ricin.

In 1978, &lt;a href="Bulgaria"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt;n defector &lt;a href="w%3AGeorgi%20Markov"&gt;Georgi Markov&lt;/a&gt; was famously assassinated in &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; with ricin injected with the tip of an umbrella.

&lt;a href="w%3AWikileaks"&gt;Wikileaks&lt;/a&gt; has claimed in a press release that the Swiss bank, &lt;a href="w%3ABank%20Julius%20Baer%20%26amp%3B%20Trust"&gt;Bank Julius Baer &amp; Trust&lt;/a&gt;, has abused the system by involving an administrator of the Wikileaks group on Facebook in the court case which has recently lead to a court injunction causing wikileaks.org DNS entry to be removed. As of this writing, Wikileaks could still be accessed via its IP address at &lt;nowiki&gt;http://88.80.13.160/wiki/wikileaks&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

The Facebook user who became involved in the court case has responded to this by saying that "I am an officer of a &lt;a href="w%3AFacebook"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; group, which is essentially a message board for discussion of issues relating to Wikileaks. I am not, and never have been, an officer of Wikileaks, and I request you [Bank Julius Baer &amp; Trust] not to represent that I am." 

Bank Julius Baer &amp; Trust’s law firm said that “as an officer of a defendant in this action, my client [Bank Julius Baer &amp; Trust] is entitled to serve you [the Facebook User] a copy of the summons and complaint pursuant.”

In a different press release, Wikileaks stated that they were not sure of the authenticity of the documents from Bank Julius Baer &amp; Trust until the court case started. They say that the bank "in attempting to shoot the messenger has only succeeded, spectacularly, in shooting itself."

The injunction, which a Wikileaks user describes as 'blind' and 'unlawful' was granted in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Northern%20District%20of%20California"&gt;California Northern District Court&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco%2C%20California"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; . The case was regarding several documents allegedly obtained from a whistleblower of the Bank Julius Baer &amp; Trust.

♡❤Wikinews♡❤ held an exclusive interview with Max Riekse, one of the candidates for the &lt;a href="w%3AConstitution%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Constitution Party&lt;/a&gt; nomination for the &lt;a href="2008%20United%20States%20presidential%20election"&gt;2008 United States presidential election&lt;/a&gt;.

Riekse is a retired decorated &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ALieutenant%20Colonel%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Lieutenant Colonel&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Army"&gt;United States Army&lt;/a&gt; who served in both the &lt;a href="w%3AVietnam%20War"&gt;Vietnam War&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20War"&gt;Iraq War&lt;/a&gt;. He is also a former public school teacher and Assistant Professor of &lt;a href="w%3AMilitary%20Science"&gt;Military Science&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20Michigan%20University"&gt;Western Michigan University&lt;/a&gt;. He has a B.A. in Political Science and International Relations from the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20South%20Florida"&gt;University of South Florida&lt;/a&gt; as well as two M.A.s, one in Political Science and International Relations, the other in Eductaion and History. Both are from Western Michigan University. 

We asked him if he thinks he has a good shot at winning the Constitution Party nomination and ultimately the presidency. He replied, "I will give it my best shot because I think I can do better then all previous Constitution Party presidential candidates...As to being in the White House in 2009, realistically, its a long shot; but so was Abe Lincoln in the new Republican Party."

When asked about America's &lt;a href="w%3APublic%20school%23United%20States"&gt;public school system&lt;/a&gt; he said, "Local school boards and the people they are responsible to are the best judge of what is needed; this with state oversight, will help boost public school quality &amp; education."

Riekse is running for president because he has been "very tired of our Republican and Democratic choices for president for many years. With a population of some 300 million people to draw from, I would think we could do much, much better then we have been doing in regards to having a choice for president."

"The finding of more cases in wild birds is not unexpected ... We are currently considering whether any additional restrictions are necessary in the area," said the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;'s Health Ministry in a statement to the media.

As a result of the finding, poultry movement has now been restricted by the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) in the areas surrounding the Swannery. The removal of all birds, dead or alive from any property now requires a license. DEFRA says the restrictions will expire no earlier than 31 days.

Ten other cases of the virus have appeared in dead birds, all &lt;a href="w%3AMute%20swan"&gt;Mute Swans&lt;/a&gt; from the same area.

Lightning head coach &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Tortorella"&gt;John Tortorella&lt;/a&gt; had his 234th win, which tied the record held by &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Johnson%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;Bob Johnson&lt;/a&gt; for most wins by an &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt;-born coach.

Tens of thousands of &lt;a href="Philippines"&gt;Filipinos&lt;/a&gt; called for President &lt;a href="w%3AGloria%20Macapagal-Arroyo"&gt;Gloria Macapagal Arroyo's&lt;/a&gt; resignation in the streets of &lt;a href="w%3AManila"&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt; in the wake of a corruption scandal. Among the protesters were nuns, farmers, students, and even two former Presidents.

Former Presidents &lt;a href="w%3ACoraz%C3%B3n%20Aquino"&gt;Corazón Aquino&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJoseph%20Estrada"&gt;Joseph Estrada&lt;/a&gt;, known for being bitter rivals, joined the group in demanding that President Arroyo resign.

"I thought my work was done because I am already old," said Aquino, 75. "But this is what the times ask for, for us to unite so that the deceit will end and we will find out the truth. Thankfully there are still many of us shouting, 'Gloria, enough, resign already.'"

Soldiers and policemen were on high alert, setting up checkpoints at major highways as demonstrators gathered in Manila's financial district. Police estimated there to be about 15,000 protesters, while organizers estimated the crowd at about 80,000.

Aquino was one of Arroyo's most loyal supporters until breaking away in 2005 amid allegations that she had rigged the 2004 election. In a recent survey of inhabitants of the island &lt;a href="w%3AMindanao"&gt;Mindanao&lt;/a&gt; commissioned by an opposition party, 58% of respondents believed Arroyo had rigged the elections.

Arroyo has been criticised because her husband had attempted to influence the approval of a $330 million government contract with the Chinese company &lt;a href="w%3AZTE"&gt;ZTE&lt;/a&gt; to build a &lt;a href="w%3Abroadband"&gt;broadband&lt;/a&gt; network connecting government offices.

Wikileaks has described the lifting of the injunction as a "blow to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABank%20Julius%20Baer"&gt;Bank Julius Baer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ." Wikileaks also claims that Judge White lifted the case because he realized the injunction "trampled the First Amendment."

The injunction, which a Wikileaks user described as 'blind' and 'unlawful' was granted in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Northern%20District%20of%20California"&gt;California Northern District Court&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;a href="San%20Francisco%2C%20California"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;. The case was regarding several documents allegedly obtained from a whistleblower of the Bank Julius Baer &amp; Trust.

Matt Zimmerman from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AElectronic%20Frontier%20Foundation"&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (EFF) has said that "We're [the EFF are] very pleased that Judge White recognized the serious constitutional concerns raised by his earlier orders." He continued by saying that "attempting to interfere with the operation of an entire website because you have a dispute over some of its content is never the right approach. Disabling access to an Internet domain in an effort to prevent the world from accessing a handful of widely-discussed documents is not only unconstitutional - it simply won't work."

In the first press release from Wikileaks after the injunction was removed, Wikileaks started by just saying “Wikileaks wins :),” followed by a series of web links. Wikileaks did, however, release more information in a future press release.

<h1>Northrop Grumman and Airbus parent EADS defeat Boeing for $40 billion US airtanker contract</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Northrop%20Grumman%20and%20Airbus%20parent%20EADS%20defeat%20Boeing%20for%20%2440%20billion%20US%20airtanker%20contract&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

It is the biggest contract of its kind since the &lt;a href="w%3AJoint%20Strike%20Fighter"&gt;Joint Strike Fighter&lt;/a&gt; program. That contract was fought for between Boeing and &lt;a href="w%3ALockheed%20Martin"&gt;Lockheed Martin&lt;/a&gt;, Lockheed ultimately winning the contest.

JSA Research defence analysist Paul Nesbit said that Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) operations across the aircraft's fifty-year service life could push the value of the contract as high as US$100 billion. Northrop Grumman CEO Ron Sugar said in an interview "Everyone told us we were crazy, that we had no chance. But we took a big swing and in this case, we hit a home run."

USAF officials said that the contract had been awarded based on competence, track record and competitive pricing, with UBS analyst David Strauss saying "The key decision was the amount of fuel the bigger plane could carry. In the armed services, you can never have too much gas in the air." USAF also denied that creating jobs in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; was a factor; job supply had been the reason Boeing were expected to win, with the airframer promising 44,000 new positions at 300 suppliers in 40 states.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANorthrop%20Grumman%20KC-45"&gt;Northrop Grumman KC-45&lt;/a&gt; tankers - more often known as KC-30s - are based on the &lt;a href="w%3AAirbus%20A330%20MRTT"&gt;Airbus A330 MRTT&lt;/a&gt;. The first four aircraft will be assembled at the main Airbus factory in &lt;a href="w%3AToulouse"&gt;Toulouse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; but by 2010-11 production of the remainder will be carried out at a facility in &lt;a href="w%3AMobile%2C%20Alabama"&gt;Mobile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Alabama"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt;. This is thought likely to create 1,500 to 2,000 jobs and support 25,000 others. 60% of the parts will be supplied by domestic manufacturers. EADS had previously announced plans to shift much production to the US due to the current weakness of the dollar.

General Arthur Lichte, head of USAF's Mobility Command, said it is hoped the first aircraft can be tested in 2010 and in operation three years afterwards. USAF's chief of staff General Duncan McNab stated "The tanker is the number-one procurement priority for us right now. It is the first step in our critical commitment to recapitalize our aging fleet to move, supply, and position assets anywhere."
There is still a possibility of Boeing challenging the decision; Boeing themselves were successfuly challenged by Lockheed and &lt;a href="w%3ASikorsky"&gt;Sikorsky&lt;/a&gt; in 2006 over a US$10 billion contract to supply &lt;a href="w%3Asearch%20and%20rescue"&gt;search and rescue&lt;/a&gt; helicopters to the &lt;a href="w%3APentagon"&gt;Pentagon&lt;/a&gt;. A statement by Boeing given by Boeing spokesman William Barksdale said “Obviously we are very disappointed... Once we have reviewed the details behind the award, we will make a decision concerning our possible options.” 

&lt;a href="Washington"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; senator &lt;a href="w%3APatty%20Murray"&gt;Patty Murray&lt;/a&gt;, who hails from the same state where Boeing bases their commercial airliner operations, said in a critical statement "We are shocked that the Air Force tapped a European company and its foreign workers to provide a tanker to our American military. At a time when our economy is hurting, this decision to outsource our tankers is a blow to the American aerospace industry, American workers and America's military." 

Washington representative &lt;a href="w%3ANorm%20Dicks"&gt;Norm Dicks&lt;/a&gt; said he too was "shocked", releasing a statement saying "This decision is even more disappointing because the Air Force had previously favored the &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20767"&gt;Boeing 767&lt;/a&gt; tanker and we were prepared to move forward with the production of 100 tankers in 2003, before the process was halted due to the Boeing scandal. I regret that it has taken so long to respond to what was—and is—an urgent need to replace these older aircraft. And even more regrettable is the decision to award the contract to Airbus, which has consistently used unfair European government subsidies to take jobs away from American aircraft workers." 

&lt;a href="Kansas"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt; senator &lt;a href="w%3ASam%20Brownback"&gt;Sam Brownback&lt;/a&gt; said "It's stunning to me that we would outsource the production of these airplanes to Europe instead of building them in America. I'll be calling upon the Secretary of Defense for a full debriefing and expect there will be a protest of the award by Boeing." &lt;a href="w%3ATodd%20Tiahrt"&gt;Todd Tiahrt&lt;/a&gt;, a Kansas representative, said "We should have an American tanker built by an American company with American workers. I cannot believe we would create French jobs in place of Kansas jobs."

A group of Washington politicians released a joint statement saying "We will be asking tough questions about the decision to outsource this contract... At a time when our economy is hurting, this is a blow not only to our state, but more than 40 states across the country who would help build this national plane." 

Alabama Governor &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Riley"&gt;Bob Riley&lt;/a&gt; said "To say this is a great day for Alabama is a monumental understatement. This will go down in history as one of our greatest days." Ralph Crosby, EADS's North America CEO and ex Northrop executive commented the business has "committed our full resources to support this vital program for our prime contractor, Northrop Grumman, the Air Force, and the war fighters that this system will serve for decades to come. We already have begun the work necessary to expand our U.S. industrial footprint in support of this important program." 

EADS chief executive Louis Gallois commented “This major selection is a win-win for our customers, for allied industrial cooperation and for EADS. It signals a quantum-leap forward in our commitment to the US defence customer, reflects and supports our global strategy to increase EADS’s industrial presence in key markets and our goal to balance the company’s defence and commercial portfolios.” General Arthur Lichte said “This will be an American tanker, flown by American airmen with an American flag on its tail and, every day, it will be saving American lives. 

Boeing had initially agreed to lease 100 tankers, but in 2003 a scandal erupted when it emerged that Boeing executive &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20M.%20Sears"&gt;Michael M. Sears&lt;/a&gt; arranged a job for USAF official &lt;a href="w%3ADarleen%20Druyun"&gt;Darleen Druyun&lt;/a&gt; while negotiations were still underway. Both served jail sentences for corruption charges and a competition was opened up to award a new contract.

The &lt;a href="w%3ACinema%20of%20Canada"&gt;Canadian film industry's&lt;/a&gt; major awards night, the &lt;a href="w%3AGenie%20Award"&gt;Genie Awards&lt;/a&gt;, takes place on Monday. The Genie Awards begun in 1949 as the Canadian Film Awards, and &lt;a href="w%3A28th%20Genie%20Awards"&gt;current nominations&lt;/a&gt; include the films ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ADays%20of%20Darkness"&gt;L'Âge des ténèbres&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAway%20from%20Her"&gt;Away from Her&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AContinental%2C%20un%20film%20sans%20fusil"&gt;Continental, un film sans fusil&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Promises"&gt;Eastern Promises&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, and ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AShake%20Hands%20with%20the%20Devil%20%282007%20film%29"&gt;Shake Hands With the Devil&lt;/a&gt;.

Notably absent from the nominations is the film ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AJuno%20%28film%29"&gt;Juno&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, an &lt;a href="w%3AAcademy%20Award"&gt;Academy Award&lt;/a&gt; nominee for &lt;a href="w%3AAcademy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Picture"&gt;Best Picture&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the lead actors in ♡❤Eastern Promises♡❤ and ♡❤Away from Her♡❤ were not &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt;, and ♡❤Eastern Promises♡❤ was filmed overseas. The leads of ♡❤Juno♡❤, in comparison, are all Canadian, and the movie was filmed in the country, despite the financial backing for the film being from an American source.
