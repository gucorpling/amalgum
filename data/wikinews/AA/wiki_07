A deputy acting for &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20R.%20Bolton"&gt;John Bolton&lt;/a&gt; told the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that Mr. Bolton orchestrated the firing of the head of a global arms-control agency in 2002. Jose Bustani, a &lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazilian&lt;/a&gt; diplomat for the agency, was trying to send chemical weapons inspectors into &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;. The former deputy told the ♡❤AP♡❤ that Mr. Bolton did not want that to happen because it might help defuse the crisis over &lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20disarmament%20crisis"&gt;alleged Iraqi weapons&lt;/a&gt; and thereby undermine a U.S. rationale for war. A spokeswoman told ♡❤AP♡❤ that Bolton has no comment.

This new information comes in the wake of what is purported to be the &lt;a href="w%3ADowning%20Street%20memo"&gt;leaked minutes&lt;/a&gt; of a 2002 meeting between top &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; government officials, in which &lt;a href="w%3AMatthew%20Rycroft"&gt;Matthew Rycroft&lt;/a&gt; reported "♡❤Bush wanted to remove &lt;a href="w%3ASaddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam&lt;/a&gt;, through military action, justified by the conjunction of terrorism and &lt;a href="w%3AWeapons%20of%20mass%20destruction"&gt;WMD&lt;/a&gt;. But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy.♡❤" Neither the UK nor the US government is disputing the accuracy of the memo.

According to multiple reports, during a 2002 meeting between National Security Advisor &lt;a href="w%3ACondoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; and a group of US Senators, &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; interrupted and changed the subject to Iraq. One of the people present told ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN's&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ Daniel Eisenberg that Bush used a vulgar epithet to refer to Saddam and concluded by saying, "♡❤We're taking him out.♡❤"

Following the 2004 presidential election, Republican members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence refused to carry out plans to review how U.S. policymakers used pre-war Iraq intelligence. The plans to review the intelligence after the election were reached as a compromise with the Democratic members of the committee, prior to elections. According to a co-chair, the president's commission on intelligence is not authorized by its charter to look into the subject. Proponents of an inquiry have been unsuccessful in getting an investigation of the matter.

<h1>The Swiss vote yes to same-sex relationships and &quot;Schengen/Dublin&quot;</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=The%20Swiss%20vote%20yes%20to%20same-sex%20relationships%20and%20%26quot%3BSchengen/Dublin%26quot%3B&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The &lt;a href="w%3ASwitzerland"&gt;Swiss&lt;/a&gt; people have voted a double yes in referenda to the proposals over &lt;a href="w%3ACivil%20union"&gt;same-sex partnerships&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ASchengen%20treaty"&gt;Schengen/Dublin&lt;/a&gt; bilateral agreements. Overall they voted 58.03% for the same-sex partnerships and 54.60% for Schengen/Dublin.

The &lt;a href="w%3Areferendum"&gt;referendum&lt;/a&gt; of allowing the registration of same-sex partnerships was widely welcomed with the people voting 58.03% Yes and 41.97% No. Same-sex partnerships are already legal in the cantons of &lt;a href="w%3Acanton%20of%20Geneva"&gt;Geneva&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACanton%20of%20Z%C3%BCrich"&gt;Zürich&lt;/a&gt;. The partnerships would carry many of the legal rights of marriage, with the exception of adoption rights and fertility treatments.

The referendum of the Schengen/Dublin bilateral agreement was initially accepted, despite growing resentment with the electorate. It was passed through with the people voting 54.60% Yes and 45.40% No. The agreement relaxes existing border controls between other participating nations in concert with the Schengen treaty, which is one of the competences for inclusion in the European Union. 

The bilateral agreement also includes participation in the &lt;a href="w%3ADublin%20Convention"&gt;Dublin treaty&lt;/a&gt;, which defines a policy for handling asylum seekers within Schengen participating countries. Also stipulated by the agreements is the use of a unified "European Informatic System" for tracking people who are wanted, missing, or are illegal immigrants and also aims to stop traffic of illegal or stolen property.

Out of the big 4 main parties the centre-left &lt;a href="w%3ASocial%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Switzerland"&gt;Social Democrats&lt;/a&gt;, the liberal-right &lt;a href="w%3AFree%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Switzerland"&gt;Free Democrats&lt;/a&gt; and the centre-right &lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20Democratic%20People%27s%20Party%20of%20Switzerland"&gt;Christian Democrats&lt;/a&gt; have said yes to both proposals, however the populist-right &lt;a href="w%3ASwiss%20People%27s%20Party"&gt;Swiss People's Party&lt;/a&gt; have said no to both proposals.

<h1>U.S. wants to impose its &quot;no-fly&quot; list on most Canadian domestic flights</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=U.S.%20wants%20to%20impose%20its%20%26quot%3Bno-fly%26quot%3B%20list%20on%20most%20Canadian%20domestic%20flights&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The government of &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; is fighting to keep &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20D.C."&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; from having access to passenger lists for Canada's domestic flights. The Canadian transport minister &lt;a href="w%3AJean%20Lapierre"&gt;Jean Lapierre&lt;/a&gt; said two-thirds of Canada's domestic flights at some point cross through American air space. The Minister said he may have to re-route them (around U.S. airspace) rather than breach the privacy rights of domestic Canadian passengers.

In plans which are not yet finalized, Washington recently warned Canada (and other countries) the U.S. intends to require that its no-fly list procedures apply to all foreign airlines which pass through U.S. airspace. After &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%2C%202001%20attacks"&gt;9/11&lt;/a&gt;, a watch list of suspected terrorists was created by the U.S. that bars those on the list from air travel within its borders.

On Wednesday, Lapierre said it's a “very hot issue,” and that he’s working to protect the privacy of Canadians.

“I’m very worried about it. We don’t think it’s a good idea that Canadians travelling from one (Canadian) city to another would have to be checked under the American no-fly list.” Lapierre said. He estimates that nearly two-thirds of the 278,000 yearly flights between Canadian cities cross over the U.S. border. Most major flight zones from urban centers in Canada are in its southern portion, close to the U.S. where even winds might push a plane across the border.

If the matter can not be resolved, Lapierre said, “We would have to take a northern route, which would be much more expensive.” ♡❤Yahoo! News Canada♡❤ reports that Lapierre intends to lobby U.S. Transportation Secretary &lt;a href="w%3ANorman%20Mineta"&gt;Norman Mineta&lt;/a&gt; against the changes.

Last year, the Canadian province of &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Columbia"&gt;British Columbia&lt;/a&gt; put controls on firms that handle an individual's personal data that prevents them from sharing private information on Canadians with U.S. authorities. The issue goes to Canada's sovereignty of its citizens and the U.S. sovereignty of its airspace.

The historically close relations between Canada and the U.S. was evident during the recent &lt;a href="w%3AVirgin%20Atlantic%20Airways"&gt;Virgin Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; incident, where a flight was intercepted by 2 Canadian &lt;a href="w%3ACF-18"&gt;CF-18&lt;/a&gt; jet fighters. They were scrambled from &lt;a href="w%3AQuebec"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt; to escort the inter-continental flight originating from &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="w%3AHalifax%20International%20Airport"&gt;Halifax International Airport&lt;/a&gt; after a hijacking signal, an apparent accident, was sent from the plane. The plane was detained in &lt;a href="w%3AHalifax"&gt;Halifax&lt;/a&gt; on Friday for approximately four hours. Ultimately it was cleared, and landed safely at its original destination in &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20F.%20Kennedy%20International%20Airport"&gt;John F. Kennedy International Airport&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;.

Both the &lt;a href="w%3AACLU"&gt;ACLU&lt;/a&gt; and the are involved in lawsuits against the U.S. government relating to no-fly lists. EPIC has received documents under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act which it says "establish that the TSA administers two lists: a "no-fly" list and a "selectee" list, which requires the passenger to go through additional security measures. The names are provided to air carriers through Security Directives or Emergency Amendments and are stored in their computer systems so that an individual with a name that matches the list can be flagged when getting a boarding pass. A "no-fly" match requires the agent to call a law enforcement officer to detain and question the passenger. In the case of a Selectee, an "S" or special mark is printed on their boarding pass and the person receives additional screening at security."

The latest album of hit &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; band &lt;a href="w%3AColdplay"&gt;Coldplay&lt;/a&gt; is due to be released worldwide this Monday (in &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;) and Tuesday (in &lt;a href="North%20America"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt;) amid rife anticipation among fans. The album, called ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AX%26amp%3BY"&gt;X&amp;Y&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, is the band's third, following ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AParachutes"&gt;Parachutes&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ which came out in 2000 and ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AA%20Rush%20of%20Blood%20to%20the%20Head"&gt;A Rush of Blood to the Head&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ which appeared in 2002. Combined sales of the first two albums are above 20m copies, making Coldplay one of the biggest bands of recent years.

The majority of music critics have given the album a good review, claiming that the band's songs have become 'tougher' and 'more diverse'.

The album, which features 13 tracks collectively accounting for 62 minutes of music, has topped &lt;a href="w%3AAmazon.com"&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;'s music sales chart since March thanks to thousands of pre-orders, breaking the record for internet pre-orders previously held by &lt;a href="w%3ADido"&gt;Dido's&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALife%20For%20Rent"&gt;Life For Rent&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

Following elections in the country of &lt;a href="w%3AKuwait"&gt;Kuwait&lt;/a&gt; on June 2, two women were appointed for the first time ever to the Kuwaiti municipal council. This follows a historic decision on May 16 that granted Kuwaiti women the right to vote and run for public office in future elections.

The Kuwaiti Minster of Social Affairs, Faysal al-Hajji, said that "During its weekly meeting on Sunday, the cabinet named two women to the municipal council for the first time in the history of Kuwait." The
women are:
<ul>
BULLET::::- Sheikha Fatima al-Sabah, architect and member of the &lt;a href="w%3AAl-Sabah"&gt;Al-Sabah&lt;/a&gt; ruling family
BULLET::::- Fawziya al-Bahar, engineer.

</ul>
The positive developments in Kuwaiti politics have been praised by many feminists and foreign observers.

The decision to grant women the vote overcame strong resistance to pass by a 35-23 margin. The only remaining Middle Eastern country that does not grant women the right to vote is &lt;a href="w%3ASaudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt;.

The sixteen members of the council are divided between ten members who are elected by popular vote, and six who are appointed. The ten elected members were all male and mostly conservative. The six appointees were the two women and four men considered to be liberals. The election and appointment results still need to be ratified by the &lt;a href="w%3AEmir"&gt;Emir&lt;/a&gt;, who has been supportive of the efforts to give women the right to vote.

Although women were not eligible to run for elective office during the most recent election, they are expected to vote and run for office in Kuwait for the first time ever beginning in the 2007 parliamentary elections.

England's woman football team made a dramatic start to their Euro 2005 campaign when a 92nd minute strike gave them victory over Finland in the City of Manchester stadium.

Twenty-nine thousand fans saw seventeen year-old Karen Carney kick the winning goal with a 15-yard shot over the keeper into the roof of the net.

England gained an early lead after a header by Amanda Barr put them ahead and an own-goal from Finland gave them a 2-0 lead at half-time.

But a revitalised Finland scored soon after the interval when Anna-Kaisa Rantanen found the back of the net, and England where under constant pressure from then on. England looked set to hold on for a victory to put them at the top of Group A until the last minute of normal time saw Laura Kalmari score, leaving the match at 2-2.

The England strike team found new vigour with Carney and her fellow forwards putting the Finns under heavy pressure, with Carney eventually defeating the Finnish keeper who had made several dramatic saves in the last ten minutes of play.

England now face Denmark on Wednesday. Denmark are expected to be a tougher opposition than Finland.

In the other Group A match, Sweden drew with Denmark, each earning one point, leaving England clear at the top of the table with three points for Sunday evening's victory.

Sweden today celebrates &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20holiday%20of%20Sweden"&gt;its first national day&lt;/a&gt; as a public holiday.

At 10 o'clock (CET) the day was officially opened by the Royal family children at the &lt;a href="w%3AStockholm%20Palace"&gt;Stockholm Palace&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AVictoria%2C%20Crown%20Princess%20of%20Sweden"&gt;Crown Princess Victoria&lt;/a&gt; said that it was a very special day.

During the day, several demonstrations are scheduled in Stockholm and the rest of Sweden.

June 6 is celebrated in the remembrance of the crowning of &lt;a href="w%3AGustav%20Vasa"&gt;Gustav Vasa&lt;/a&gt; in 1523. The Gustav Vasa-reference is a somewhat criticized in parts of Sweden that weren't a part of Sweden back then.

Since 1983 it's a National day, but it has been an ordinary weekday until 2005. Thus, the Swedes haven't celebrated their National day much at all, compared to e.g. the Norwegians.

The International Criminal Court has announced an investigation into war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Darfur region of &lt;a href="w%3ASudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt;.

51 names of suspects have been handed to the ICC by a UN inquiry into the crisis, in which up to 350,000 people have been killed and more than two million displaced by a militia force, the Janjaweed ('men on horses'). The attacks, repeatedly called genocide by the U.S. administration, are directed towards black Africans. 

Kolawole Olaniyan, Director of Amnesty International’s Africa Programme, said: “This announcement brings hope for justice and accountability for the
victims of killings, massive forced displacement and rape in Darfur.

“However, for it to be meaningful for the people of Darfur, there must be a
commitment on the part of the Sudanese government to fully support the ICC
investigation – including by protecting victims and witnesses and arresting
and surrendering persons subject to ICC arrest warrants.

“The victims cry out for justice, not for the cosmetic actions of a
government that still denies that mass rape has been committed and has
shown itself to be unable and unwilling to address the crimes being
committed in Darfur. There should also be reparations for the victims who
have lost everything and are facing a third year of misery and insecurity
in camps”.

The government of Sudan has so far refused to accept the validity of an international investigation.

&lt;a href="Brazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; – 
The Brazilian Deputy &lt;a href="w%3ARoberto%20Jefferson"&gt;Roberto Jefferson&lt;/a&gt; told the Brazilian newspaper &lt;a href="w%3AFolha%20de%20S%C3%A3o%20Paulo"&gt;Folha de São Paulo&lt;/a&gt; that the ruling &lt;a href="w%3AWorkers%27%20Party"&gt;Workers' Party&lt;/a&gt; (PT) has paid Brazilian deputies 30 thousand Brazilian Reals (US 12 thousand) each, every month. Deputy Jefferson is the President of the &lt;a href="w%3ABrazilian%20Labour%20Party"&gt;Brazilian Labour Party&lt;/a&gt; (PTB) and he is accused of directing a corrupt scheme that involves the Brazilian postal service. The PTB is an ally of the government.

Jefferson's allegations increase the severe political crisis regarding the government of &lt;a href="w%3ALuiz%20In%C3%A1cio%20Lula%20da%20Silva"&gt;Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva&lt;/a&gt;. Lula has convened a special meeting to discuss the crisis in the government. Because of the recent scandal Brazilian stock markets went down and the U.S. Dollar increased its value in relation to the Brazilian Real.

The Brazilian Senate and the Chamber of Deputies are discussing the installation of a special congressional commission to investigate the allegations. The first attempt of the Brazilian government to prevent the creation of the Congress' special commission (convincing some deputies not to endorse the commission's creation) has failed. Now the government is trying to stop the creation of the commission in the Senate and is lobbying against it in the Congress, trying to influence both senators and deputies.

The opposition party, PSDB, criticized recently the efforts of the Brazilian government to stop the special commission of investigation, using the influence of the Minister of the Economy Antonio Palocci.

The Workers’ Party published in its webpage a note denying Jefferson’s allegations and saying that it supports investigations by Brazilian authorities. The Brazilian Minister Waldir Pires has said in an interview with Agencia Brasil that the denunciations of corruption are appearing more because the government is fighting against them. He also blamed previous governments by the corruption.

In a note in the Workers’ Party website, the party accuses the former-President Fernando Henrique Cardoso government of corruption.

On April 2005, the Mayor of Rio de Janeiro, Cesar Maia, denounced the Workers’ Party payment to deputies.

The allegations of Jefferson marks the beginnings of a severe crisis in Brazilian government. This is the most severe crisis since the impeachment of the former President &lt;a href="w%3AFernando%20Collor%20de%20Mello"&gt;Fernando Collor de Mello&lt;/a&gt; in 1992.

Politicians from the opposition said that they don't want the impeachment of Lula, however they demand the investigation of all denunciations and that the guilty be punished.

According to the Brazilian newspaper &lt;a href="w%3AO%20Estado%20de%20S%C3%A3o%20Paulo"&gt;O Estado de São Paulo&lt;/a&gt;, the newspaper of TV Globo informed that the former-goalkeeper of Santos Football Club and son of the famous soccer player &lt;a href="w%3APel%C3%A9"&gt;Pelé&lt;/a&gt;, Edinho, was arrested in company of another 17 persons. The police accuse them of drug trafficking and connections with a criminal organization in Rio de Janeiro.

The arrest happened this Monday, June 6, by morning.

The 'text lottery' for tickets to the &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALive%208"&gt;Live 8&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ concert began this morning. The concert, which is part of an international music bonanza taking place across &lt;a href="North%20America"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;, is planned to coincide with this summers &lt;a href="w%3AG8"&gt;G8&lt;/a&gt; summit in &lt;a href="w%3AEdinburgh"&gt;Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt;. 

Organised by &lt;a href="Bob%20Geldof"&gt;Bob Geldof&lt;/a&gt;, the series of concerts are being held to raise awareness about &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; among young people. This is in contrast to the original ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALive%20Aid"&gt;Live Aid&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ concerts which were more focused on raising money for Africa.

This evening a spokesperson for ♡❤Live 8♡❤ revealed to the media that by 17:00UTC this afternoon, over 1.5m text entries had been received. Those hoping to win one of the coveted 150,000 tickets, are asked to text the answer to a simple question to 84599. The question is ♡❤Which city is nearest to the G8 summit in July? A) &lt;a href="w%3ABerlin"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, B) &lt;a href="w%3AMoscow"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt;, C) &lt;a href="w%3AEdinburgh"&gt;Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt;.♡❤ Texts cost £1.50 each and winners will be randomly selected on the 12th June by a computer. The first £1.6m of proceeds from the competition will be donated to the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3APrince%27s%20Trust"&gt;The Prince's Trust&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

The lineup for the London concert is as follows:

&lt;a href="w%3AJack%20Straw%20%28politician%29"&gt;Jack Straw&lt;/a&gt;, the Foreign Secretary for the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, said on Monday that the UK will not vote as planned on the new &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Constitution"&gt;constitution for the European Union&lt;/a&gt;. "Until the consequences of &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ANetherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; being unable to ratify the treaty are clarified it would not in our judgment now be sensible to set a date," said Straw.

A British poll indicates 56% would vote "no" at this point if given a chance, while only 22% would vote "yes".

Following the UK's decision, the &lt;a href="w%3ACzech%20Republic"&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt; also suspended its referendum. Prime Minister Jiri Paroubek said that for his country it is "impossible at this moment [to have its referendum]. At this moment it is necessary to start with discussions about future of the European constitution, about the future of this process in the Czech Republic," said Paroubek, citing "strong opposition" to the treaty.

Other remaining countries such as &lt;a href="w%3ADenmark"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIreland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3APoland"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; could also suspend their &lt;a href="w%3Areferendum"&gt;referendums&lt;/a&gt;. French President &lt;a href="w%3AJacques%20Chirac"&gt;Jacques Chirac&lt;/a&gt; and German Chancellor &lt;a href="w%3AGerhard%20Schroeder"&gt;Gerhard Schroeder&lt;/a&gt; are pushing for the &lt;a href="w%3Aratification"&gt;ratification&lt;/a&gt; process to continue.

The draft of the new EU constitution was approved in 9 other countries, before being rejected in referendums held in France on May 29 and in the &lt;a href="w%3ANetherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; on June 1. The constitution requires the unanimous approval of all 25 EU countries by November 1, 2006 to take effect, a prospect that seems increasingly remote.

Republican Dino Rossi, Washington State Gubernatorial Candidate in the 2004 election, said that he will not appeal the decision made today in Chelan County Superior Court by John Bridges after he ruled that the Republicans failed to prove Rossi would have won the election if illegitimate votes were not counted. “Unless an election is clearly invalid, when the people have spoken their verdict should not be disturbed by the courts,” said Bridges in his verdict. With the appeals over the closest gubernatorial race in U.S. history has finally ended.

“It’s an emotional day, it’s an emotional moment,” said Washington Governor Christine Gregoire. “I’m ready to move on. I want the state of Washington to be served by a full-time governor who is not being distracted by anything other than serving the citizens.” Bridges said he believed that 1,678 illegal votes were cast in the election, but Republicans didn’t prove those votes changed the outcome of the election, and that the only vote that was proved to be illegally cast for the governor’s race was one cast for Libertarian Ruth Bennett and four more cast for Rossi, ultimately still giving Gregoire a 133-vote margin.

Any registered voter of Washington State could still file paperwork to recall the election; however, they would have to prove Gregoire got in office illegally and get several signatures for it to appear on a ballot.

&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Kerry"&gt;John Kerry&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AYale"&gt;Yale&lt;/a&gt; transcript was released as a part of his naval records late last month.

A number of American news sources have drawn attention to the fact it shows that Kerry's grades were slightly lower than &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;'s. This is contrary to popular perception, which portrays Kerry as an "intellectual" and Bush as a "regular guy". Bush's transcript was published in 1999 by ♡❤The New Yorker♡❤. Kerry earned a 76 percent cumulative average during his four years at Yale, while Bush earned a 77 percent his first three years and a similar average his fourth year under a non-numerical grading system. Both Bush and Kerry began their memberships in &lt;a href="w%3ASkull%20and%20Bones"&gt;Skull and Bones&lt;/a&gt; while at Yale.

According to a new report by the &lt;a href="w%3AStockholm%20International%20Peace%20Research%20Institute"&gt;Stockholm International Peace Research Institute&lt;/a&gt; (SIPRI), total world military spending was $1.35 &lt;a href="w%3Atrillion"&gt;trillion&lt;/a&gt; in 2004. The institute says that this is just 6% off the all time record, set in 1987 at the end of the &lt;a href="w%3ACold%20War"&gt;Cold War&lt;/a&gt;. However this record could soon be shattered as spending jumped 5% last year alone.

In a stark example of the huge amount spent on the military by the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, SIPRI revealed that almost half of all spending is by the US, $455bn or 47% to be exact. This figure is greater than the ♡❤combined♡❤ spending of the next 32 heaviest spenders. US spending on its armed forces now stands at 3.9% of its &lt;a href="w%3AGDP"&gt;GDP&lt;/a&gt;, less than the 6% during the Cold War, but more than the 3% reported the previous year.

The top five spenders in 2004 were as follows:

Despite the strong 'no' votes in both &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt; foreign minister &lt;a href="w%3ADermot%20Ahern"&gt;Dermot Ahern&lt;/a&gt; has confirmed that Ireland will still hold a referendum on the proposed &lt;a href="w%3AEU%20constitution"&gt;European Union constitution&lt;/a&gt;. This comes following the Irish rejection of the &lt;a href="w%3ANice%20Treaty"&gt;Nice Treaty&lt;/a&gt; in 2002.

Speaking to &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; radio Mr. Ahern said "We've made a decision based on the commitment that we gave when we put the constitution together in draft form." He went on to say "Over 50 percent of the population of Europe have already ratified the convention. What do you say to those people: 'Your votes mean nothing'?" (note that the only country where the constitution was directly ratified by the population and not by the parliament so far is Spain). Unlike in most European countries, in Ireland by law any change to the core treaties of the EU must be put to a referendum.

The constitution was agreed upon by EU heads of state earlier this year under Ireland's European presidency. It is backed by all major Irish political parties including the main opposition, &lt;a href="w%3AFine%20Gael"&gt;Fine Gael&lt;/a&gt;.

An airline stowaway, possibly of &lt;a href="w%3ASenegal"&gt;Senegalese&lt;/a&gt; origin was found dead this morning by &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Customs%20Service"&gt;U.S. customs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Port%20Authority"&gt;NY Port Authority&lt;/a&gt; personnel, his body badly mangled by the landing gear of a South African Airways aircraft.

A &lt;a href="w%3ANassau%20County%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Nassau County&lt;/a&gt; woman returned home from work to find part of the man's leg lying on her lawn.

The identity and nationality of the man are not yet known. The flight on which he stowed away originated in &lt;a href="w%3AJohannesburg"&gt;Johannesburg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; and made one stopover in &lt;a href="w%3ADakar"&gt;Dakar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASenegal"&gt;Senegal&lt;/a&gt;.

A hardy new strain of a deadly bacteria that has killed 12 elderly patients
and infected 300 others in a British hospital may have been imported from
either the United States or Canada.

The new variant of clostridium difficile, which causes severe diarrhea,
broke out 18 months ago at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, and it's speculated
that the bacteria might have been brought in by either an American or
Canadian patient to the hospital's famed spinal-injuries unit.
&lt;a href="http%3A//news.independent.co.uk/uk/health_medical/story.jsp%3Fstory%3D644855"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Initial investigation by Britain's Health Protection Agency indicates that
the new strain is similar to one circulating in the United States and
Canada.
&lt;a href="http%3A//www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1118150952318_9/%3Fhub%3DHealth"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The spore-forming bacteria thrives in the intestines when the normal
balance of bacteria shifts --- something that can happen after a dose of
antibiotics --- and toxins are then produced, which can cause extreme
diarrhea.

This new strain of clostridium is particularly resilient and has even shown
resistance to certain disinfectants. It spreads by contact and can survive
up to 70 days, living on hospital floors and toilet seats.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AS%C3%A3o%20Paulo%2C%20Brazil"&gt;São Paulo, Brazil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — Edson Cholbi Nascimento, also known as Edinho, son of the &lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazilian&lt;/a&gt; former soccer player &lt;a href="w%3APel%C3%A9"&gt;Pelé&lt;/a&gt; was arrested by Brazilian police. He is accused of involvement with &lt;a href="w%3Adrug%20trafficking"&gt;drug traffic&lt;/a&gt;. He and another 17 persons according to local newspapers and ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AO%20Estado%20de%20S%C3%A3o%20Paulo"&gt;O Estado de São Paulo&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ were arrested on Monday during a operation of Denarc, the anti-drugs police department.

Pelé contacted the son at the police station. Very sad, with tears in his eyes Pele said that he got surprised when he received the news that his son was arrested because of drugs. During a press conference on Tuesday he said that he doesn't understand why some people use drugs. "This must not be used as an excuse but you who accompanied my life since the beginning know of my fight against drugs, and you know my effort in making clear that this thing [drug] is not good for no human being", he said.

Edinho admitted that he is &lt;a href="w%3Aaddiction"&gt;addicted&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3Amarijuana"&gt;marijuana&lt;/a&gt;, but denied any involvement in drug traffic or other criminal activities.

Edinho wrote a note and released it through his lawyer today. In the note Edinho said that he "had no disposition or control of his thoughts, everything in search of satisfaction in drug, marijuana".

The note ends saying: "I realize how wrong and harmful is the way to drugs and I humbly recognize my situation as addicted and I ask help to everyone who loves me, my family, fans and forgive me because at some moment I became a not good example. Thank you, Edinho."

According to the authorities Edinho is being indicted by association to drug traffic.

The police operation conducted by Denarc arrested until now 52 persons in &lt;a href="w%3AS%C3%A3o%20Paulo"&gt;São Paulo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASantos"&gt;Santos&lt;/a&gt;. The main suspect is Ronaldo Duarte Barsotti de Freitas, known as Naldinho. He is accused of drug traffic and according to police is involved in a dispute with another two criminal organizations: the Comando Vermelho (Red Command) from Rio de Janeiro and the PCC (Fist Command from Capital) from São Paulo. Nadinho and the enterpriser Clóvis Ribeiro who was also arrested are considered by Denarc director the biggest drug dealers from the state. Clovis is suspected of being involved with the &lt;a href="w%3AFARC"&gt;FARC&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne%2C%20Australia"&gt;Melbourne, Australia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
Australia's oldest video game development studio is working on a of Eden Games' &lt;a href="http%3A//xbox360.ign.com/objects/747/747892.html"&gt;♡❤Test Drive: Unlimited♡❤&lt;/a&gt;, the latest in the series.

A source inside the studio has confirmed that the title in development is a PS2 port of Eden's next-generation game.

Although established a strong reputation for driving games with the acclaimed ♡❤Test Drive: Le Mans♡❤ (Sega Dreamcast), recent ventures away from the genre such as ♡❤Men In Black II: Alien Escape♡❤ and ♡❤Transformers: Armada♡❤ (targeted at the high end of the market) have failed to make an impact.

However, speculation about the studio's long term future took another turn this week when Atari CEO James Caparro resigned. Although the ambitious natural disaster themed ♡❤The Big One♡❤ was cancelled when former CEO took a back seat in November last year, the project - known inside the studio as Bonnell's "pet" - might be revived now Bonnell has been appointed interim CEO in the wake of Caparro's resignation.

"Who knows, it might be [♡❤The Big One♡❤], it might be another port," the source said.

Two senior game designers have resigned from the studio in the past month.

♡❤Copenhagen, Denmark♡❤ - The Danish Integration Minister Rikke Hvilshøj's car was set ablaze outside her family-home on the morning of Wednesday 8 June. From there, the fire spread to the family's garage, and further on to the side of the house, damaging the roof above the kitchen and children's room.

At the same time, an e-mail was sent to several media agencies, where a group calling themselves "Action Group Beate" claimed responsibility, saying it is a "protest against the racist immigrational laws of Denmark". The police found the computer used for sending the mail within a few hours, and closed down the cybercafé whilst removing the computer.

Throughout the Danish political system politicians from both the ruling party and the opposition have expressed their outrage over the terrorism.

The insurance company is currently assessing the amount of damage done to the home, but so far they have made an estimate of £27.000, just for the house damages.

A statement issued by &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Jackson"&gt;Michael Jackson&lt;/a&gt;'s defense attorney Tom Meserau will not delay deliberations in the Michael Jackson case. At 2200 UTC time on Wednesday, a judge in the case announced a statement that would be released an hour later. The statement was apparently from Jackson's defense attorney, which according to CNN states the following:

♡❤I have not authorized anyone to speak or hold press conferences on behalf of Michael Jackson or his family. A gag order is in effect which the defense team will continue to honor.♡❤

The statement follows the comment made by Jackson's spokeswoman Raymone Bain, who stated that she was forced to appear at the courthouse where Jackson's trial was being held. The statement came after a reporter accused Bain of appearing at a courthouse press conference when on unfavorable terms with Meserau. 

Thursday will begin day five of jury deliberations in the trial which the pop star is accused of sexually molesting a thirteen-year-old boy back in 2003.

Internet search engine, &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, saw its valuation top the $80bn mark this week, making it the world's most valuable media company - ahead of &lt;a href="w%3ATime%20Warner"&gt;Time Warner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AWalt%20Disney"&gt;Walt Disney&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AViacom"&gt;Viacom&lt;/a&gt;. Since its flotation on the &lt;a href="w%3ANASDAQ"&gt;NASDAQ&lt;/a&gt; in August 2004, it has seen its share price increase dramatically from $85 to over $280 today.

Despite being more valuable than Time Warner, which is worth $78bn, Google's annual sales amount to less than a 13th of the far more diversified and traditional media giant. Google's revenues are $3.2bn a year versus the $42bn a year that Time Warner generates. The gap in valuations is partly justified by investors based upon Google's much higher growth rate.

For comparison the top media companies in the world are, by market capitalization (as of &lt;a href="w%3AJune%206"&gt;June 6&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="2005"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt;):

A bus collision with a truck in &lt;a href="w%3AUganda"&gt;Uganda&lt;/a&gt; has resulted in at least 30 fatalities and has left a further 21 injured. The bus, which was heading for &lt;a href="w%3ANairobi"&gt;Nairobi&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AKenya"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt;, crashed in the &lt;a href="w%3AKabale"&gt;Kabale&lt;/a&gt; district of Uganda near the &lt;a href="w%3ARwanda"&gt;Rwandan&lt;/a&gt; border. Of the 30 fatalities, 25 died instantly upon impact whilst the remaining 5 died later in hospital. 

"There were 20 survivors, the majority of them are in critical condition," said Cyprian Gatete, Rwanda's assistant commissioner of police, during a telephone conversation with Reuters.

The survivors of the accident were initially taken to Kabale Hospital in Uganda, but were later flown back to hospitals in Rwanda. It remains to be seen what exactly caused the accident, however South African news source ♡❤Independent Online♡❤ is reporting that a Rwandan reporter on the scene speculated that the bus seemed to have swerved into oncoming traffic.

&lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; based QLogic Corporation has announced that it is to establish its EMEA (&lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Middle%20East"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;) headquarters in &lt;a href="w%3ACounty%20Dublin"&gt;County Dublin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. The new centre will be based in a 20,000-square-foot facility in &lt;a href="w%3ABlanchardstown"&gt;Blanchardstown&lt;/a&gt;. Up to 100 people will be employed there within five years time.

QLogic manufactures many important components that are used in servers, PC's and various networking products by companies such as &lt;a href="w%3ADell%2C%20Inc."&gt;Dell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACisco%20Systems"&gt;Cisco&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AHP"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt;.

The CEO of QLogic, Mr. H. K. Desai, said of the companies decision to locate in Ireland "We chose Dublin as we believe it will best service our long-term needs, enable us to recruit the calibre of people we require and facilitate the timely delivery of product to our customers overseas.”

Ireland has continued to attract large amounts of &lt;a href="w%3AFDI"&gt;FDI&lt;/a&gt; in recent years despite the slowdown in the world economy in 2002. Recent additions to Ireland's list of multinationals include &lt;a href="w%3AAmazon.com"&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AeBay"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABell%20Labs"&gt;Bell Labs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AYahoo"&gt;Yahoo&lt;/a&gt;.

Having drawn with &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; twice in their last two games, the &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Republic of Ireland&lt;/a&gt; football squad have received a much needed confidence boost. They beat the &lt;a href="w%3AFaroe%20Islands"&gt;Faroe Islands&lt;/a&gt; 2-nil away to earn the three points which takes them to the top of Group 4; one ahead of &lt;a href="w%3ASwitzerland"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;. However the Irish have seven games played - one more than most of the other Group four members.

After a fruitless first half, Ireland gained the upper hand in the 51st minute thanks to a solid penalty taken by &lt;a href="w%3AIan%20Harte"&gt;Ian Harte&lt;/a&gt;. The penalty was given after the home team's keeper, Jakup Mikkelsen, brought down Stephen Elliott.

The second goal came shortly after when &lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Kilbane"&gt;Kevin Kilbane&lt;/a&gt; found the back of the net to finally settle the Irish nerves.

Canadian forecasters are predicting more rain in the upcoming two days as floodwaters wash across southern Alberta, forcing people in West Bragg Creek and High River to evacuate their homes.
&lt;a href="http%3A//www.edmontonsun.com/News/Alberta/2005/06/08/1076719-sun.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

As rain continues to steadily fall, Alberta Environment has issued a flood warning on more than 20 rivers as more than 100 to 170 millimetres have fallen in certain areas over the last few days.

The sight of swollen rivers brings to mind the floods of ten years ago in the same region, when water levels rose to such a height that, at the time, it was considered a once in a 125-year event. &lt;a href="http%3A//calgary.cbc.ca/regional/servlet/View%3Ffilename%3Dca-flooding-rivers20050607"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

About 200 High River residents have been forced to evacuate and about 3,500 people living around the community’s golf course were put under a voluntary evacuation order.

Meanwhile, Manitoba has also seen more rain than usual this time of year and is facing a flooding situation that’s been described as worse than the one faced by the province in 1999. Roads and bridges have been washed out and fears are growing among farmers that their crops will drown under the watery conditions. &lt;a href="http%3A//winnipeg.cbc.ca/regional/servlet/View%3Ffilename%3Dmb_flooding-20050603"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

There have been estimates that as much as 10% of crops may have been lost in Manitoba. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.canoe.ca/NewsStand/WinnipegSun/News/2005/06/08/1076379-sun.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The wet weather has also been affecting the neighbouring province of Saskatchewan, where a flood watch has been put on towns surrounding the South Saskatchewan River basin. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20050608.wflood0608/BNStory/National/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

More than half of &lt;a href="w%3AUganda"&gt;Ugandan&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="w%3AYoweri%20Museveni"&gt;Yoweri Museveni's&lt;/a&gt; convoy was prevented from entering &lt;a href="w%3ARwanda"&gt;Rwanda&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday. The President was travelling to Kigali to hand over the chairmanship of the &lt;a href="w%3ACommon%20Market%20for%20Eastern%20and%20Southern%20Africa"&gt;Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa&lt;/a&gt; (COMESA) to Rwandan president &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Kagame"&gt;Paul Kagame&lt;/a&gt;.

Rwandan officials have been quoted as saying that the Ugandan convoy violated rules on the number of guns they are allowed to carry across the border.

Uganda has blamed the incident solely on Rwanda, arguing that the situation could have been resolved with much less controversy.

"What happened at the border was the sole responsibility of the Rwandese officials involved. If there had been extra guns, why could they not be left on the border for later collection and allow the vehicles to continue?" said a statement from Uganda's foreign ministry.

"The guns could even have been returned to Uganda, it is only 200 meters away. The body guards normally travel with guns even in commercial airlines. You surrender the guns to the pilots. They, then, give them to you on arrival," it added.

The Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, is a free trade area stretching from Egypt to Namibia. It was formed in December 1994.

Relations between Uganda and Rwanda have been improving over the last few years, however recently the situation has deteriorated.

<h1>Rwandan genocide investigations to be completed by end of July</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Rwandan%20genocide%20investigations%20to%20be%20completed%20by%20end%20of%20July&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The investigations into the 1994 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARwandan%20genocide"&gt;Rwandan genocide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; should be completed by the end of July, according to a spokesperson for the traditional &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGacaca%20court"&gt;Gacaca courts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The courts are a form of community based justice that were set up in an attempt to deal with the nearly 100,000 people accused of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Awar%20crimes"&gt;war crimes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

"Work is progressing quite fast in most places across Rwanda. We are looking at finalizing the investigation phase by the end of July", said the spokesman, Innocent Musafiri.

The courts were set up three years ago, however so far their time has been taken up with trial runs. There are 10,000 courts across the country, and they are expected to take eight years to process all accused. Regular courts would have taken up to 100 years. The judges are untrained citizens elected by their peers.

The 1994 Rwandan genocide was an eruption of ethnic conflict where &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHutu"&gt;Hutu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; militia, supported by the Hutu dominated government and encouraged by 'hate radio', attempted to ethnically cleanse the minority &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATutsi"&gt;Tutsi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Despite numerous warnings the international community did not take serious action to prevent the atrocities, which included hacking people to death with machetes, and forcing people into buildings that were then destroyed with bulldozers. Estimates place the number killed at up to one million.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Sources%20close%20to%20both%20sides%20say%20NHL%2C%20NHLPA%20agree%20on%20Salary%20Cap%20structure&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="http%3A//www.theglobeandmail.com"&gt;The Globe and Mail&lt;/a&gt; (Toronto, ON), citing sources close to both sides in the dispute, reported Wednesday that the &lt;a href="w%3ANHL"&gt;National Hockey League&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ANHLPA"&gt;NHLPA&lt;/a&gt; have agreed to a salary cap structure, arguably the most contentious issue in the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Hockey%20League%20labor%20dispute%20%282004%29"&gt;continuing lockout&lt;/a&gt; that led to the cancellation of the 2004-05 NHL season on 16 February, 2005.

The Globe and Mail is reporting that the deal, providing the "cost certainty" that the NHL has been seeking, will consist of a floating, team-by-team salary cap and floor based on a percentage of each team's revenue projections. What is being reported as a six-year deal has a salary cap range of $34-36 million and a salary floor of $22-24 million, both hard caps. The new deal will also reportedly include the across-the-board 24% decrease in salary offered by the NHLPA in February. A dollar-for-dollar Luxury tax will also take effect at the halfway point between the lowest salary floor and the highest salary cap (slated to be $29 million for the first year of the deal). Details about what will be done with this money have not been completely worked out, but it is thought that this money will be distributed to teams below the halfway point in such a way as to make sure they remain above the salary hard minimum.

While this is one of the most contentious issues in the labor dispute, there are several other issues that may delay the signing of a new &lt;a href="w%3ANHL%20Collective%20Bargaining%20Agreement"&gt;Collective Bargaining Agreement&lt;/a&gt;. These include deciding how high-payroll teams will drop to the new maximum, working on new systems for salary arbitration, free agency, Olympic participation, and drug testing, and to design a complete revenue-sharing system.

<h1>More political, soccer-related unrest in Iran follows Bahrain victory</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=More%20political%2C%20soccer-related%20unrest%20in%20Iran%20follows%20Bahrain%20victory&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

More unrest occurred overnight across &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; following the national soccer team's June 9 victory over the team from neighboring &lt;a href="w%3ABahrain"&gt;Bahrain&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href="w%3AFIFA%20World%20Cup"&gt;World Cup&lt;/a&gt; qualification match. 

<h2>Soccer Jubilation Pushes Boundaries</h2>
The match marked the first time since the &lt;a href="w%3A1979"&gt;1979&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AIslamic%20Revolution"&gt;Islamic Revolution&lt;/a&gt; that women could attend a soccer match. A group of one hundred pre-selected women were admitted to the game under official escort; a protest group of a further twenty-six women attempted to gain admission, but were dispersed by police.

A young Tehran resident reported via &lt;a href="w%3Ainstant%20messenger"&gt;instant messenger&lt;/a&gt; that she heard what appeared to be raucous celebrating outside the night of the 1-0 victory over Bahrain. She had been babysitting that night, and returned quickly home, having decided it was probably not safe to investigate the crowds after hearing a large boom, which she attributed to pranksters possibly detonating outsized illegal &lt;a href="w%3Afireworks"&gt;fireworks&lt;/a&gt;. However, she also noticed that a public telephone had been damaged. 

If utilities were being damaged, it is very possible that the boom was produced not by a high explosive, but by the bursting of &lt;a href="w%3Asodium%20vapor%20light"&gt;sodium vapor lamp&lt;/a&gt; bulb that had been knocked over by vandals -- this reporter has seen it happen before, and can attest that it sounds very much like an explosion.

<h2>Some Crowds Get Political</h2>
In the city of &lt;a href="w%3ATabriz"&gt;Tabriz&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Azerbaijan%20Province"&gt;East Azerbaijan&lt;/a&gt;, demonstrators reportedly tore down a large poster of the late &lt;a href="w%3AAyatollah%20Khomeini"&gt;Ayatollah Khomeini&lt;/a&gt; (founder of the present Islamic Republic of Iran) and burned it while chanting "Freedom!" and anti-regime slogans. The crowds of young people caused traffic congestion, apparently halting movement through the center city for several hours. Numerous arrests have been reported. The city is home to a substantial Turkic &lt;a href="w%3AAzeri"&gt;Azeri&lt;/a&gt; minority, but the unrest seems to be political in nature, not ethnic.

Meanwhile, in the theological center of &lt;a href="w%3AQom"&gt;Qom&lt;/a&gt;, reformist politician Behzad Navabi was attacked by a group of about thirty unidentified men who apparently disagreed with his political platform. The group employed lethal and non-lethal weapons, including &lt;a href="w%3Atear%20gas"&gt;tear gas&lt;/a&gt;, to disrupt Navabi's political rally. Navabi reports that he suffered a skull fracture and numerous cuts and bruises in the attack. Police clashed with the attackers, and eventually arrested some of them. Navabi is a member of the ♡❤Mujahadeen of Islamic Revolution♡❤ party and a backer of reform presidential candidate &lt;a href="w%3AMustafa%20Moin"&gt;Mustafa Moin&lt;/a&gt;.

Tropical Storm Arlene, the first named storm of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2005%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season"&gt;2005 Atlantic hurricane season&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , formed as Tropical Depression One on Wednesday in the northwestern &lt;a href="Caribbean"&gt;Caribbean&lt;/a&gt;. At 8 am Eastern Time on Thursday, it strengthened to tropical storm status. The storm was forecast to track north over the western tip of &lt;a href="Cuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt; and eventually make landfall over the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGulf%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;Gulf Coast of the United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and the storm is producing heavy rains and gusty winds over portions of &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;.

The government of the &lt;a href="Cayman%20Islands"&gt;Cayman Islands&lt;/a&gt; has issued a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Atropical%20storm%20warning"&gt;tropical storm warning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for that country, and the government of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADry%20Tortugas"&gt;Dry Tortugas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has issued a tropical storm warning. A tropical storm warning is in effect for the northern coast of the &lt;a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico"&gt;Gulf of Mexico&lt;/a&gt; from Grand Isle, Florida to St. Marks, Florida. A &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ahurricane%20watch"&gt;hurricane watch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is also in effect from the mouth of the Pearl River to Panama City, Florida. A tropical storm watch remains in effect from west of Grand Isle, &lt;a href="Louisiana"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; to Morgan City, Louisiana.

Tropical Storm Arlene has already been affecting Cuba with heavy rainfall and gusty winds. Heavy rain fall was already moving onshore well in advance of the center. Heavy rainfall, accompanied by brief gusty winds, gradually spread across western and central Cuba; and into extreme southern &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, especially the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFlorida%20Keys"&gt;Florida Keys&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Total rainfall amounts of 5 to 10 inches, with maximum amounts of up to 15 inches in the highlands, have occurred in Cuba. 3 to 5 inches of rain is expected over the Florida Keys.

Coastal storm surge flooding of 2 to 4 feet above normal tide levels, along with large and dangerous battering waves, can be expected near and to the east of where the center makes landfall. Water levels are currently about one-half foot above normal tide levels along the northern gulf coast. Some coastal flooding is possible on the southern coast of western Cuba.

Isolated tornadoes may occur over portions of southern Florida and the Florida Keys on Friday.

As of 2 pm Eastern Time on Friday, it was moving northward at 13 mph with maximum sustained wind speeds of near 60 mph, with gusts at higher speeds. A gradual turn toward the north-northwest with a slight increase in forward speed is expected during the next 24 hours. On this track, the center of Arlene will be approaching the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico on Saturday. However, most of the weather associated with Arlene will arrive much earlier than the center. Tropical force winds extend outward up to 150 miles to the north and east of the center. Minimal central pressure just reported by an air force reserve reconnaissance plane was 997 millibars (mb), 29.44 inches.

The current location of the center of the storm is &lt;a href="http%3A//maps.google.com/maps%3Fq%3D27.1%2BN%2B86.1%2BW%26amp%3Bspn%3D11.096191%2C16.215820%26amp%3Bt%3Dk%26amp%3Bhl%3Den"&gt;27.1° N, 86.1° W&lt;/a&gt;, which is about 75 miles southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River, and about 400 miles south-southeast of Pensacola, Florida.

Arlene is the most commonly used name for Atlantic tropical cyclones, having now been used nine times.

Canada's top court has struck down Quebec's bans on private health care insurance, citing an increased risk to the life and health of Canadians. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20050609.wscoc0609_1/BNStory/National/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The Supreme Court of Canada ruling looked into a patient's right to pay for faster service in a system that currently treats patients on the basis of equal access to medical care, regardless of income. &lt;a href="http%3A//news.ft.com/cms/s/a9a1c0ea-d8ff-11d9-8403-00000e2511c8.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Quebec patient George Zeliotis, a chemical salesman who waited in pain for more than a year in 1997 to have his hip replaced, said he should have had the right to pay for surgery.

Under public health care, it's forbidden to pay for services covered under the system.

Despite free medical treatment, there are often long waiting lists for operations and services with current public health care.&lt;a href="http%3A//www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/N09580086.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Together with physician, Dr. Jacques Chaoulli, Mr. Zeliotis launched a challenge to the Supreme Court of Canada, after losing their fight in Quebec's lower courts, arguing that having to wait for surgery violates a patient's constitutional right to life, liberty, and security of the person. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1118251482569_47/%3Fhub%3DHealth"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Mr. Zeliotis and Dr. Chaoulli argued that being able to pay for private medical services wouldn't be detrimental to the public health care system.

The Quebec Superior Court and the Quebec Court of Appeal had dismissed the case, ruling that the provincial law's intent was not to discriminate among patients and to provide health care based on need rather than a patient's ability to pay.

The Canadian Medical Association said the Superior Court of Canada ruling could "fundamentally change the health-care system in Canada as we now know it" but declined to comment any further until it had time to study the decision. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.recorder.ca/cp/National/050609/n060916A.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Secretary-General"&gt;United Nations Secretary-General&lt;/a&gt; has criticised &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; handling of prisoners in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, during a recent report to the &lt;a href="w%3AUN%20Security%20Council"&gt;UN Security Council&lt;/a&gt;. He said that the prisoners were denied due legal process and other rights guaranteed under &lt;a href="w%3Ainternational%20law"&gt;international law&lt;/a&gt;. 

"One of the major human rights challenges remains the detention of thousands of persons without due process. Despite the release of some detainees, their number continues to grow. Prolonged detention without access to lawyers and courts is prohibited under international law including during states of emergency," the Secretary General's report said.

His argument is that since the US has declared that the occupation has ended and sovereignty has been handed to the Iraqi's, it has no legal right to detain prisoners. 
The US military has defended its actions, saying that it has not breached prisoners' rights under the Geneva Conventions, and is acting to process current detainees as quickly as possible.

On Thursday night, &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%20State%20Senate"&gt;California State Senator&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Dunn"&gt;Joe Dunn&lt;/a&gt; held the second town hall meeting regarding a recent outbreak of &lt;a href="w%3Aleukemia"&gt;leukemia&lt;/a&gt; in schoolchildren, at Franklin Elementary in &lt;a href="w%3ASanta%20Ana%2C%20California"&gt;Santa Ana, California&lt;/a&gt;. Representatives from the City of Santa Ana, the Santa Ana Unified School District, and the South Coast Air Quality Management District (AQMD) were available to answer the community's questions.
Senator Dunn started off the meeting by thanking the panelists and parents for showing their support by attending. "We are trying to address a very, very important issue. What's the issue? We have high rates of cancer, leukemia, and respiratory problems in our children. Why are our kids sick? This is a very difficult question," he said. "What's causing the sickness in our children, and how can we avoid it? We can all agree that ♡❤no one♡❤ wants to see another sick child in Santa Ana." The audience applauded. "Three weeks ago, we heard from two parents and a teacher, they told us about some deaths."

The &lt;a href="Mothers%2C%20teachers%20concerned%20about%20leukemia%20deaths%20at%20California%20elementary%20school"&gt;previous town hall meeting&lt;/a&gt; was held to address concerns of the community about a steel plating manufacturing plant that applied to the AQMD for a permit to expand its facilities to increase pollution emissions. Parents and teachers were concerned over the facts that the plant was located directly adjacent to Kennedy Elementary School, and that their children were experiencing high levels of lead, respiratory problems, excessive nose-bleeding, and leukemia.
"How many businesses in Santa Ana are required to obtain permits for [emissions] of hazardous pollutants?" This question Dunn posed at the last meeting was answered by the AQMD and the Orange County Sanitation District, who provided maps of Santa Ana with green flags indicating where businesses with emissions permits were located. "I can tell you one thing, at the end of the meeting, we won't have all of the answers... but we'll certainly have another Town Hall meeting.

Initial concerns were raised when five boys attending Franklin Elementary were diagnosed with the same type of leukemia in Spring 2002. Attempts to gain an investigation from the &lt;a href="w%3ACenter%20for%20Disease%20Control"&gt;Center for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt; (CDC) into possible causes were not successful as the Center told parents that the cases "were in an acceptable range". Parents, teachers, public officials, and doctors remain unconvinced. In the past three years, 19 mothers living in an apartment building a block away from Franklin were also diagnosed with leukemia.
Dunn then introduced a teacher at Franklin, Tammy Sanchez. Tammy said, "In December 2002, we received some very disturbing news. One of my students was diagnosed with leukemia. Then, more children at Franklin were diagnosed with leukemia. I later found out that three kids at a nearby apartment building were diagnosed with leukemia. Sanchez then explained about more cancer-related deaths near Franklin, including 19 mothers all living in he same apartment building who were diagnosed with leukemia, which took over three minutes. "To me, this is way too much," said Sanchez.
Socorro Molina, whose son Diego, a student at Franklin, is undergoing treatment for his leukemia, had this to say: "My son has leukemia. I'm worried, because there are many kids. Children who played with my son died from leukemia. They should do some investigations of these companies." Senator Dunn responded, "Thank you, Socorro. I know it's difficult to share that privately, and you have shared this with us publicly on two occasions."
Senator Dunn then said, "at the end of that [previous] meeting, we were requested by a parent for a map of all businesses releasing toxic materials. We asked the AQMD for a map that showed every single business [in Santa Ana] that releases harmful materials into our air. This is that map. The heaviest concentration of these businesses are, guess where? Near Franklin. This map is ♡❤striking♡❤. The OCSD gave us a map showing all businesses that release toxic materials into our sewers. The largest concentration of these businesses are, guess where? Near Franklin and Kennedy [Elementary Schools]." Senator Dunn promised that at the next town hall meeting, he will have a panel of scientists present to determine if the substances released by these business pose a health risk to residents of the area. "We are going to keep at this until we find out what is making our kids sick," he said.
Santa Ana City Council member Jose Solorio said that "the city has been following the media's attention. I got to tell you, this is a very complex issue. The city has jurisdiction over land use; they can issue restrictions. We, as elected officials, need to know more." Solorio then introduced the city's planning director and other city officials. Solorio added, "the mayor of Santa Ana, Miguel Pulido, is a board-member for AQMD." Miguel Pulido has not attended any of the town hall meetings, and has not spoken about this issue at any time.

Dunn then introduced the next panelist, Santa Ana Unified School District board member Rosemary Avila. She said, "the school board is looking into this. I've talked to some teachers on the phone I believe the federal disease organization has been contacted about this." The Center for Disease Control was notified by parents of the leukemia cases in Santa Ana, but stated that they were "within the acceptable range". Avila then introduced some school board officials, and said, "there has been some concern in the past, and we have looked into that. As a school district, we really have to act not out of fear, but with facts."
Jill Whynot of the AQMD noted that "there are 515 facilities [in Santa Ana] that we issue permits to". Barry Wallerstein, Executive Officer of the AQMD said, "we appreciate the forum. There appears to be a need for closer air quality monitoring. So, I propose that we make Santa Ana a high priority and closely monitor air quality in your community." That statement was met with much applause from the audience.

Senator Dunn responded, "we thank the AQMD for being here and answering our questions. We will be sure to let everybody know about any updates. When I looked at the map, I was struck. There are 515 permitted businesses in Santa Ana. We will bring some scientists in at the next town hall meeting to determine which businesses are releasing carcinogenic pollutants," he said. "When I look at the maps, there are two pockets of permitted facilities in Santa Ana. Do you [AQMD] look at the cumulative impact of facilities grouped together [when considering issuing a permit]?" Dunn posed.

Dr. Wallerstein responded, "the short answer is 'partially'".
Senator Dunn, responding to Dr. Wallerstein's comments, said "if we need to give AQMD more power in terms of cumulative impact of permitted facilities, then we will introduce legislation to give them that power." The Senator then asked City Councilman Solorio, "does the city in any way look at what type of business it is, or its cumulative impact [when approving a business]?"

Solorio responded, "one of the main things the city does is make a General Plan, and unlike Irvine or Newport Beach, we are an older city." Solorio went on to talk about how in the future, the city could pass litigation limit permits, and said that "we all need to do our part". Referring to concerns about the steel plating plant next to a school, he said, "Markland came into an industrial area, so they have a legal right to set up shop".

Dunn asked Solorio if the city is now looking at regulation to limit this, and Solorio responded, "We always have opportunities to look at our General Plan, and we need to have solid facts to make those decisions". Dunn asked Dr. Wallerstein, "what about this pocket of businesses in south Santa Ana, is that unusual?" Wallerstein responded, "Senator, I don't think that's an issue".
Dunn then opened up the floor to public questions and comments. One mother of three asked, "when are we going to have answers?", while a younger woman said, directed toward the AQMD, "your job is to know if this is going to give kids leukemia. I'm very disappointed". One woman said, "I live in Heninger Park, where all of the kids are getting Leukemia. I've been trying to tell the city and Code Enforcement about illegal underground painters and mechanics who leave paint and fumes behind; which is causing residents to leave".
There was intense debate over the public officials' efforts to investigate health quality at the location in question. Parents expressed their concerns about water quality and illegal activities in the community; and spoke about their children's various health problems, from high copper and lead levels in the bloodstream, to respiratory and lung problems, and cancer.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=British%20man%20involved%20in%20deal%20to%20drill%20for%20oil%20in%20Darfur&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The British TV station Channel 4 has discovered that the Sudanese government has signed a deal for a contract to drill for oil in southern Sudan, and that the key man in securing the deal is British.

Friedhelm Eronat, who until two years ago was an American citizen, secured the largest stake made in a consortium that won the drilling contract in 2003. Oil was discovered in April of this year.

Geologists have long suspected the presence of oil in the south of the Sudan. Clivenden Sudan, which Eronat personally owned in 2003, had a high level of expertise in the country's geology.

The twenty five year deal secured by Clivenden Sudan will see it pay the Sudanese government $8m in the event oil is produced. The government will also receive 70% of the profits from the oil.

In a statement to Channel 4 News, Eronat said that he is not a shareholder or officer of Cliveden Sudan, that he does not work for or financially benefit from Cliveden Sudan, and that Cliveden Sudan is not the operator of the concession, only a shareholder.

Cliveden Sudan itself said "there has been no commercial oil find in Block C [the area being explored for oil]."

Villages in Darfur 180km from the Clivenden Sudan wells have been attacked by Sudanese troops and aircraft.

Eronat became involved in the deal through Lebanese businessman Eli Calil, who has been accused of funding a failed coup in Equatorial Guinea last year (allegations denied by Calil). Calil and Eronat live near each other in the London suburb of Chelsea.

At least one rebel group in Darfur is certain the search for oil will inflame the conflict in Darfur. The Justice and Equality Movement wants exploration to stop until peace is established.

A member of the JEM, Ahmad Hussein, told Channel 4 News: "So when they say they discover oil in Darfur, who is going to benefit from that? Are they the people of Darfur? Of course not. Absolutely not, the only beneficiaries is the ruling elite and ruling minority of the regime."

Eronat changed his nationality from American to British in October 2003, shortly before the deal was signed. Under US law, he could have faced up to ten years imprisonment and/or fines of $500,000, due to US sanctions on Sudan.

The UK government has been at the forefront of efforts to try and halt the crisis, with international development minister Hilary Benn making a statement to the house of commons yesterday after a visit to the region. He said: "I visited the Kalma camp in South Darfur and the El Meshtel and Abu Shouk camps in North Darfur where tens of thousands of people are facing a precarious existence. I spoke to men and women whose homes have been destroyed, villages burned, and whose communities have been the victims of killings, looting and rape.

"We are in a race against time in Darfur, and the UK remains committed to doing all that it can to help those affected and to work for a just and lasting peace for its people."

The Swedish organization Antipiratbyrån (The Swedish Anti-Piracy Bureau) suffered a massive blow today when the Swedish government's Data Inspection Board stated that the Bureau's storage of Internet user's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIP%20address"&gt;IP addresses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is illegal.

Antipiratbyrån is an organization representing the movie and software industry in Sweden, working to protect the intellectual property of its beneficiaries. This spring they started collecting IP-addresses of suspected &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACopyright%20infringement"&gt;copyright infringers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . They used the collected information to press charges and to contact the suspect's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20service%20provider"&gt;Internet service providers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , demanding repercussions.

The Data Inspection Board's press release established that the collection of IP-addresses is in fact a violation of the Swedish Personal Data Law, prohibiting electronic storage of information about individuals without their consent.

- If they don't cease with the activities we might follow up with a penalty order, the supervising director Britt Marie Wester at the Data Inspection Board says to TT.

Both the Swedish organization &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APiratbyr%C3%A5n"&gt;Piratbyrån&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; - celebrating the verdict as a great victory - and the CEO of Jens of Sweden - a Swedish manufacturer of MP3-players - have stated that they might file a class action suit against the Anti-Piracy Bureau, together with the individuals registered.

Some minutes before midnight local time on Thursday, &lt;a href="w%3AEduardo%20Rodriguez%20Veltz%C3%A9"&gt;Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé&lt;/a&gt;, then President of the Supreme Court of Justice, took oath as the new president of Bolivia, a country that has found itself plunged in a serious crisis for several months.

Earlier on Thursday, the Legislature had suspended the session that had predicted, in the House of the Liberty of &lt;a href="w%3ASucre%2C%20Bolivia"&gt;Sucre&lt;/a&gt;, to decide the name of the new president of the Bolivians, due to the intensified protests after it become known that a minor was killed by the Army. The demonstrations also brought along a strong resistance of various social sectors to possible appointment of Hormando Vaca Diez, president of the Senate, or Mario Cossío, president of the House of Representatives, who constitutionally would have to succeed departing president Carlos Mesa, who resigned on Monday night.

Nevertheless, at 22:45 local time (02:45 UTC on Friday), Congress resumed the session, accepted unanimously the renunciation of Mesa, and named Rodriguez Veltzé, a 49-year-old lawyer from &lt;a href="w%3ACochabamba%2C%20Bolivia"&gt;Cochabamba&lt;/a&gt;, as the new temporary president of the country, after Vaca Diez and Cossio declined their rights of succession. In his acceptance speech, Rodriguez Veltzé said he's convinced that his mandate "has to do with a renewal of the system" and promised to call the anticipated elections in a maximum of 150 days, just as the Bolivian Constitution says. Besides, he asked his countrymen to "give him a necessary and prudent time to elect a new constitutional president" and to "stop all the pressures and all the mobilizations".

The coca leader Evo Morales, main opponent of Mesa and Vaca Diez, has previously endorsed the appointment of Rodriguez Veltzé and, although he wants a constitutional assembly, probably desists as the temporary president fulfills his promise to call anticipated polls, possibly next December. By aside, the Congress would have that to call to parliamentary elections, since the Constitution only obliges the temporary president to call assemblies for president and vice president.

An &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;n-trained doctor that was apparently so inept that he was nicknamed "&lt;a href="w%3AJayant%20Patel"&gt;Dr. Death&lt;/a&gt;" by former colleagues is now the focus of an international hunt launched by &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n police.

Dr. Jayant Patel, an Indian-born &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; citizen, is being linked to at least 87 deaths over the course of two years. A government inquiry has recommended he be charged with murder and negligence causing harm.

Toni Hoffman, the nurse who called Dr. Patel's surgical record to attention in March, said, "We'd taken to hiding patients. We just thought, 'What on earth can we do to stop this man?'"

The &lt;a href="Queensland"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt; state inquiry has recommended Dr. Patel be charged with the murder of James Edward Phillips, a cancer patient, who died five days after Dr. Patel removed a part of Mr. Phillips' oesophagus, despite the fact that Mr. Phillips had been refused surgery because his chances of survival were slim.

Another of Dr. Patel's patients, Marilyn Daisy, was left unattended after a leg amputation and another doctor found her nearly comatose a few days after the operation.

Compounding the murder and negligence charge are allegations that Dr. Patel falsified his Queensland work application records by neglecting to mention his disciplinary history in the United States.

Dr. Patel was hired by Queensland's Bundaberg Base Hospital in 2003. 

While working in &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; in 1984, complaints arose over Dr. Patel not adequately examining patients before surgery. And in 2001, Dr. Patel was forced to surrender his medical license. 

Currently, Dr. Patel's whereabouts are unknown, though there's been speculation that he's returned to his former home in Portland, &lt;a href="Oregon"&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt;.

He left Australia in April shortly after the allegations against him were made.

In a statement issued Friday evening, United States Marine officials said five &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Marines"&gt;Marines&lt;/a&gt; had been killed in a roadside blast in Western Iraq.

The Marines were killed as a result of an explosion while conducting combat operations with 2nd Marine Division, Expeditionary Force, in Haqlaniyah, Iraq.

The attack itself came hours after reports that up to 17 bodies had been found in the same province. Reports say that the bodies were killed "execution style" and were near Anbar.

In Baghdad, up to three Iraqi civilians were killed and several others were wounded in a car bomb blast, that exploded near a busy marketplace in the mainly Shia district of Shula.

Department of Defense officials identified the Marines to be Lance Cpl. Dustin V. Birch, 22, of Saint Anthony, Idaho; Lance Cpl. Daniel Chavez, 20, of Seattle, Wash; Lance Cpl. Thomas O. Keeling, 23, of Strongsville, Ohio; Lance Cpl. Devon P. Seymour, 21, of St. Louisville, Ohio;
and Cpl. Brad D. Squires, 26, of Middleburg Heights, Ohio.

A House subcommittee voted Thursday to sharply reduce the federal government's financial spending, including eliminating taxpayer funds that help produce such shows as &lt;a href="w%3ASesame%20Street"&gt;Sesame Street&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AArthur"&gt;Arthur&lt;/a&gt;.

In addition, the subcomittee also acted to eliminate federal money for the Corporation for Public Broadasting, a body designed to pass funds onto public broadcasters; starting with a 25 percent reduction next year, from $400 million to $300 million.

Overall, the cuts would signal the most dramatic cutback of public broadcasting the &lt;a href="w%3ACongress"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt; created the CPB in 1967.

A &lt;a href="US%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House&lt;/a&gt; subcommittee voted Thursday to sharply reduce the federal government's financial spending for Fiscal Year '06, including eliminating taxpayer funds that help produce such shows as &lt;a href="Sesame%20Street"&gt;Sesame Street&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AArthur%20%28TV%20series%29"&gt;Arthur&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The spending cutbacks far exceeded even those requested by the White House. Among initiatives slated for reduction are $39 million for conversion to digital programming and $50 million for upgrading &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APBS"&gt;PBS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's aging satellite technology.

The subcommittee also acted to eliminate federal money for the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACorporation%20for%20Public%20Broadcasting"&gt;Corporation for Public Broadcasting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a body created by Congress to pass funds on to public broadcasters. The CPB would see a 25 percent reduction in next year's budget, down from $400 million to $300 million, funds that currently account for 14.9% of all public broadcasting revenues&lt;a href="http%3A//www.cpb.org/about"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Ideological concerns over publicly-financed content have recently become a point of contention for the Republican-controlled CPB. The day after the new budget was approved, CNN obtained an internal memo by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANPR"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's executive vice president Ken Stern that blamed the cuts on "recent public turbulence caused by CPB chairman Ken Tomlinson's irresponsible attacks on public broadcasting." Stern's memo also told staffers the cut would not hurt NPR directly because it receives little direct support from the CPB. Instead, he emphasized, smaller local stations that rely upon federal dollars are most likely to be affected, which could in turn take a bite out of regular dues and fees, NPR's largest revenue source.

Under the budget, the Ready to Learn program's $23 million appropriation for children's shows is rescinded in its entirety. John Lawson, president of the Association of Public Television Stations, said the cut was retribution for an episode of "Postcards From Buster" featuring a pair of lesbian parents from Vermont. A spokesman for the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20House%20Committee%20on%20Appropriations"&gt;Appropriations Committee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , John Scofield, denied the claim.

"Ready to Learn was one of more than 50 programs terminated in the spending bill," he told the New York Times. "It might be a nice program to do, but not in a flat budget with large budget deficits. We felt the same way about 49 other programs."

Overall, the cuts would signal the most dramatic cutback of public broadcasting since &lt;a href="US%20Congress"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt; created the CPB in 1967. The spending bill is expected to pass the Appropriations Committee and the House, but final legislation will be negotiated with the Senate.

An e-mail virus affecting &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20Windows"&gt;Microsoft Windows&lt;/a&gt; is currently making the rounds, trying to ensnare victims by claiming that pop-star &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Jackson"&gt;Michael Jackson&lt;/a&gt; has attempted suicide.

The message itself hopes to catch people's attention, because of the huge interest in his on-going child abuse trial. The fake message contains a web link that supposedly links to Mr Jackson's suicide note.

A security consultant from security firm Sophos says "That may not surprise people who think it might contain genuine breaking news about Michael Jackson," and that "The sick minds behind viruses and other malware often exploit celebrity names and news stories in an attempt to infect as many people as possible," said Ms Theriault.

She urged users to be very wary when opening e-mail attachments in unsolicited e-mail messages.

The &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation"&gt;Federal Bureau of Investigation&lt;/a&gt; (FBI) missed several opportunities to uncover and to possibly stop the September 11 terrorist attacks against the United States, a report has found.

The agency did not respond to leads and failed to follow up a theory that al-Qaeda was sending its members to US-based flight schools, it said. The report by the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice"&gt;United States Department of Justice&lt;/a&gt;'s Inspector General said that mistakes amounted to a "significant failure".

The conclusions indicated in the report are similar to others, drawn up after investigations into US intelligence performance in the months and years leading up to the events that occurred on September 11, 2001.

The report is a year old -- but is only being released after a legal battle involving lawyers for &lt;a href="w%3AZacarias%20Moussaoui"&gt;Zacarias Moussaoui&lt;/a&gt;, who has been convicted of an al-Qaeda plot against the United States, but is currently fighting a possible &lt;a href="w%3Adeath%20penalty"&gt;death penalty&lt;/a&gt;.

Wrangling between musician &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Jackson"&gt;Michael Jackson&lt;/a&gt;'s legal and public relation teams may have yielded its first casualty. Jackson's official website, www.mjjsource.com, reports that Jackson's MJJ Productions has terminated spokeswoman Raymone Bain and public relations firm Davis, Bain, and Associates. On Wednesday, Bain held a press conference amidst a court-issued gag order which she implied was sanctioned by the Jackson legal team. The same day, Jackson's attorney Thomas Mesereau, Jr. released a court-approved terse message: "I have not authorized anyone to speak or hold any press conferences on behalf of Michael Jackson or his family." 

Despite the www.mjjsource.com announcement, late Friday the &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; quotes Bain responding, "I have not been fired by Michael Jackson." Bain says she works directly for Jackson himself, not MJJ Productions.

The controversy occurs as Michael Jackson awaits a verdict on charges that he molested a teenage boy in 2003. On Friday, the jury completed its sixth day of deliberations. The twelve jurors will reconvene on Monday.

A truck collided with a bus on Friday, seriously injuring five children and one adult, authories have said. The bus was taking 25 children of immigrant workers to an amusement arcade.

"The more seriouslly hurt youngsters have suffered broken bones and head injuries", said Fire-Rescue deputy Steve Delai. One young boy and a 30 year old were in intensive care at Delray Medical Center late Friday, officials have reported.

Two other children were in a stable condition, while conditions for the other two seriouslly injured children were not available.

"It appears that the bus was in the center lane and the tractor-trailer was in the right lane. For some reason the bus got into the path of the tractor-trailer," A Florida Highway Patrol officer told a local television station.

The finance ministers of the &lt;a href="w%3AG8"&gt;G8&lt;/a&gt;, the world's eight richest countries, after years of pressure from wide coalitions of &lt;a href="w%3Ahuman%20right"&gt;human rights&lt;/a&gt; campaigners, such as the &lt;a href="w%3ACommittee%20for%20the%20abolition%20of%20the%20third%20world%20debt"&gt;Committee for the abolition of third world debt (CADTM)&lt;/a&gt;, have agreed to a deal to relieve the debts of 18 of the poorest countries in the world, but have not yet published the full details.

The &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Monetary%20Fund"&gt;International Monetary Fund (IMF)&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Bank"&gt;World Bank (WB)&lt;/a&gt;, and the African Development Fund will write off all of the money owed to them by the selected countries. However, the &lt;a href="w%3AInter-American%20Development%20Bank"&gt;Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AAsian%20Development%20Bank"&gt;Asian Development Bank (AsDB)&lt;/a&gt; will ♡❤not♡❤ cancel debts owed to them by &lt;a href="w%3AHeavily%20Indebted%20Poor%20Countries"&gt;heavily indebted poor countries (HIPCs)&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href="w%3ABolivia"&gt;Bolivia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANicaragua"&gt;Nicaragua&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHonduras"&gt;Honduras&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGuyana"&gt;Guyana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AVietnam"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ALaos"&gt;Laos&lt;/a&gt;.

The countries to receive debt cancellation from the IMF, WB and the African Development Fund are &lt;a href="w%3ABenin"&gt;Benin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABolivia"&gt;Bolivia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABurkina%20Faso"&gt;Burkina Faso&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AEthiopia"&gt;Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGhana"&gt;Ghana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGuyana"&gt;Guyana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHonduras"&gt;Honduras&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMadagascar"&gt;Madagascar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMali"&gt;Mali&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMauritania"&gt;Mauritania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMozambique"&gt;Mozambique&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANicaragua"&gt;Nicaragua&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANiger"&gt;Niger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARwanda"&gt;Rwanda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASenegal"&gt;Senegal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATanzania"&gt;Tanzania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUganda"&gt;Uganda&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AZambia"&gt;Zambia&lt;/a&gt;.

The deal, devised by the United Kingdom, could potentially free up government revenue for domestic spending on things such as education and health services. 

The World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the African Development Fund will write off all of the money owed to them by the above listed nations. A total of $40bn will be cleared, which will save debt repayments of $1.5bn a year.

CADTM argues that this is a negligible effort by the rich countries, since $1.5bn a year is extremely small compared to the $350bn the G8 devote to farming subsidies or the $700bn they spend in military expenditure each year. Moreover, these 18 countries only represent about 5% of the population of developing countries.

Another twenty countries may become eligible to have their debts cleared if they meet criteria decided by G8 finance ministries. 

According to G8 representatives, the main criteria are the reduction of corruption and better government. According to critics, such as the &lt;a href="w%3ACADTM"&gt;CADTM&lt;/a&gt;, the criteria include the privatisation of natural resources and of strategic economic sectors to the benefit of transnational &lt;a href="w%3Acorporate%20personhood"&gt;corporation&lt;/a&gt;s, higher costs of health care and education through privatisation, a rise in &lt;a href="w%3AVAT"&gt;VAT&lt;/a&gt;, free flow of capital, which leads to capital leaving the country as shown by several &lt;a href="w%3AUNCTAD"&gt;UNCTAD&lt;/a&gt; reports, lower tariff protection, which leads to thousands of small and middle producers losing their livelihoods because they cannot compete with imported goods.

The CADTM claims that the G8 agreement ♡❤can solve neither the issue of the debt nor the issue of poverty since it bears on only 2% of the external debt of developing countries♡❤ and demand ♡❤an immediate and complete cancellation of the public external debt of all developing countries, the burden of the debt being a major obstacle to meeting fundamental human needs.♡❤

Other groups, including charities, have similarly stated that the debts of 62 countries need to be cleared if the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; wants to meet its target of halving world poverty.

Fourteen of the countries to receive debt relief are in sub-Saharan Africa.

The alleviation of third world debt has been a lifelong ambition of &lt;a href="w%3AGordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt;, the current UK chancellor, and he has used all of his political power and status to push for this agreement in the G8 group.

Missing American teen &lt;a href="w%3ANatalee%20Holloway"&gt;Natalee Holloway&lt;/a&gt;, who vanished on the Dutch island of &lt;a href="w%3AAruba"&gt;Aruba&lt;/a&gt; two weeks ago, is feared to be dead today following a suspect's statement earlier this morning. The suspect, who is yet to be named, told police that "something bad happened" to the missing teen. Police Commissioner District 1 Gerold Dompig said that the suspect was leading police to a scene, where it is believed a major update to the case is to be found.

Two security guards were taken into police custody early last week: 28-year-old Abraham Jones and 30-year-old Mickey John. Additionally, three teenagers who were believed to be the last people to have seen Halloway are now under custody. Among the three teenagers is 18-year-old Satish Kalpoe, 21-year-old Depak Kalpoe, and 17-year-old Joran van der Sloot, a friend of the brothers and son to a Judicial Servant.

Anita van der Sloot, mother of suspect Joran van der Sloot, told American news network &lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; that her son stated to her that he was "innocent", and even offered to speak to Holloway's family. No announcement from police has yet confirmed the death of Holloway.

The government of &lt;a href="Brazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;ian President &lt;a href="w%3ALuiz%20In%C3%A1cio%20Lula%20da%20Silva"&gt;Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva&lt;/a&gt; is in a severe political crisis. The crisis began after the exposure of a series of scandals which involve the &lt;a href="w%3AWorkers%27%20Party%20%28Brazil%29"&gt;Workers' Party&lt;/a&gt;, the Brazilian ruling party. 

In 2002, Celso Daniel, the mayor of &lt;a href="w%3ASanto%20Andr%C3%A9"&gt;Santo André&lt;/a&gt;, 10 km (6 miles) away from the &lt;a href="w%3AS%C3%A3o%20Paulo"&gt;São Paulo&lt;/a&gt; city, was murdered. Daniel was a member of the ruling Workers' Party. The mayor's brother says that Daniel died because he was in disagreement to a supposed bribe conspiracy organized by some Workers' Party members. The case remains under investigation by police. 

In 2004, the former adviser to the government of President Lula, Waldomiro Diniz, was accused of negotiating with "bicheiros" (men who deal with: "Jogo do Bicho", or illegal gambling) and extorting money for Workers' Party (PT) electoral campaigns. A supposed victim of extortion released a tape exposing Diniz. The tape's authenticity has been verified by experts and it was aired by the major Brazilian television stations. A Congressional special commission was proposed by non-government parties so the denunciation could be investigated. The government succeeded in stopping the creation of the commission. 

On March 16, the leading Brazilian magazine &lt;a href="w%3AVeja%20%28magazine%29"&gt;Veja&lt;/a&gt; published a story saying that according to documents of the &lt;a href="w%3AAg%C3%AAncia%20Brasileira%20de%20Intelig%C3%AAncia"&gt;Brazilian Agency of intelligence&lt;/a&gt; (Abin) the Workers' Party received 5 million dollars to be used by political campaigns of their candidates in 2002 from the Colombian communist armed group &lt;a href="w%3ARevolutionary%20Armed%20Forces%20of%20Colombia"&gt;Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia&lt;/a&gt; (FARC-EP). Abin said that the documents were not authentic.

Last month, some men, supposedly involved in illicit negotiations with the Brazilian Post Service recorded a video which shows former Post Office Chief, Maurício Marinho, during a supposed bribe negotiation. In the tape, Marinho receives and puts in his pocket R$3,000 (about 1,259 USD) in cash. He insinuates that the scheme is commanded by deputy Roberto Jefferson. The recording was aired by the major Brazilian television stations.

Roberto Jefferson is the president of the government-allied Brazilian Labor Party (PTB). Lula da Silva said in a earlier occasion that he "would give to Jefferson a bank check in blank", what means that he had high confidence on Jefferson. 

Still related to the Post Office case, on June 2, Lídio Duarte, the former president of IRB, a government enterprise, denied allegations that money from some Brazilian government enterprises was going to PTB, Jefferson's party. An earlier story published by magazine Veja, said that Duarte was a victim of extortion by a representative of PTB. According to Veja, Duarte resigned from the Presidency of IRB, because he had difficulties in continuing to give more money to PTB. Lídio denied this story to the police, and furthermore he said that he never have had an interview with Veja's journalists.

On June 8, the magazine Veja released for &lt;a href="http%3A//veja.abril.com.br/idade/exclusivo/080605/audios_corrupcao.html"&gt;download&lt;/a&gt; in its webpage, an audio tape where it can be heard the voice of Lidio Duarte during an alleged interview to Veja. In the tape, Lidio Duarte talks about being under pressure because someone was asking him more contribution in money for PTB. The tape contradicts the Duarte's testimony to the police and because of that, he became subject of investigation by the authorities. The name of the deputy Roberto Jefferson is cited by Duarte in the alleged recorded interview to Veja.

After the Post Office scandal been exposed, the Brazilian Congress proposed the creation of a Congress' special commission, so it could be investigated by the Parliament. The government, however, protested against it, arguing that political adversaries were anticipating the dispute to the next election for Brazil's Presidency. Workers' Party senator Eduardo Suplicy protested in Senate against his party decision. Because that he was very criticized and he got subject to punishment by the Workers' Party. 

On June 6, Roberto Jefferson told the Brazilian newspaper &lt;a href="w%3AFolha%20de%20S%C3%A3o%20Paulo"&gt;Folha de São Paulo&lt;/a&gt; that the ruling Workers' Party (PT) has payed Brazilian deputies 30 thousand Brazilian Reals (US 12 thousand) each, every month. The stock markets went down and the U.S. Dollar increased its value in relation to the Brazilian Real. A new Congress' special commission was proposed by some Brazilian senators, so Jefferson's allegations could be investigated. The Workers' Party says that Jefferson's allegations were untrue and that he had no proofs.

After Jefferson's denunciation the focus of the scandal moved to the government and the ruling Workers' Party. Because the government were under pressure, the Workers' Party changed his earlier decision of stopping the creation of a Congress' special commission for the Post Office scandal. The proposal for the creation of a Congress' special commission for the Post Office scandal was approved.

On June 9, there was the first meeting of members of the Congress' special commission for the Post Office scandal. Because of unsolved disputes between government's parliamentarians and the other parties representatives, the meeting could not continue. The government's block argued that it must choose the president and the report for the commission, since the government commission members are the majority. Other parties argue that according to Parliament tradition the government should choose one member for the presidency or report and the opposition should choose the other member.
A new meeting was scheduled to the next week, on Tuesday, June 14.

Besides these scandals, the current Social Security Minister, Romero Jucá, is accused of having
offered seven non-existent farms as guarantee for a financing from the Banco of Amazonia, among other denunciations of misuse of public loans. The current President of Brazilian Central Bank, Henrique Meirelles, is accused of financial fraud among other accusations. Also there is a denunciation of a irregular transference of founds of Central Bank to the construction of a new headquarter for the Workers' Party.

On June 4, during the so called Curupira operation, the Brazilian Federal Police arrested members of IBAMA, a Brazilian agency for environment. Among other accusations, they are accused of selling irregular licenses for deforestation in Amazon. At least one of the suspects, a Workers' Party affiliate, is under suspection of have used the money for the political campaign of a Worker's Party candidate in &lt;a href="w%3AMato%20Grosso"&gt;Mato Grosso&lt;/a&gt;.

Besides the commission to investigate the Post Office scandal, another Congress' special commissions were suggested by non-government members of Brazilian Senate: a commission to investigate the IRB scandal and another one to the investigation of Roberto Jefferson's allegations. Also, it is expected that the Brazilian Courts rule against the earlier government decision of stopping the creation of a commission for the investigation of the alleged Waldomiro Diniz scandal. 

<h2>Repercussions</h2>
The scandals involving the ruling Workers' Party are receiving a good attention by the public and the media. According to the Senator Pedro Simon (center-left, PMDB), an old member of Senate, one reason is because that one of the mains Workers' Party mottos was the fight against corruption. But after Lula became President on 2003, the government and the Workers' Party has been envolved in a series of severe scandals and the government has tried to stop the investigations, which is suspicious. Besides that, all scandals originated inside the government, according to Simon. The Waldomiro and the Post Office scandals emerged after the denunciations of people supposedly under pressure and involved in these scandals. 

According to members of Brazilian Court, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva may be subjected to an &lt;a href="w%3Aimpeachment"&gt;impeachment&lt;/a&gt; process, if there is some proof that he is really envolved on some of the alleged scandals, or case someone can proof that he was acting with negligence.

Part of opposition avoids talking about impeachment. According to the governor of &lt;a href="w%3AMinas%20Gerais"&gt;Minas Gerais&lt;/a&gt;, Aécio Neves (left, &lt;a href="w%3AParty%20of%20the%20Brazilian%20Social%20Democracy"&gt;PSDB&lt;/a&gt;), "President Lula is not President Collor". President &lt;a href="w%3AFernando%20Collor%20de%20Mello"&gt;Fernando Collor de Mello&lt;/a&gt; was submitted to a impeachment process in 1992 because of alleged denounciations of corruption in his government.

Cesar Maia (center-right, &lt;a href="w%3AParty%20of%20the%20Liberal%20Front%20%28Brazil%29"&gt;PFL&lt;/a&gt;), the Mayor of &lt;a href="w%3ARio%20de%20Janeiro"&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt;, and one of the probable adversaries of Lula in the next election for President, said that he still believes that Lula can explain all the corruption allegations against his government. But he also said that if Lula doesn't succedd explaining the scandals, he will require the President's impeachment.

Some of the harsh critics to Lula's government comes from the Senator Heloísa Helena (left, &lt;a href="w%3ASocialism%20and%20Freedom%20Party"&gt;PSOL&lt;/a&gt;). Her party, PSOL, is a dissidence of Workers' Party and the party claims that all denountiation must be investigated, besides the alleged government efforts by the party that the government is trying to stop the investigations. 

The Senator Demóstenes Torres (PFL) is another harsh critic of the alleged Lula's scandals. He cited the former deposed President Fernando Collor de Mello, during some of his discurses in Brazilian Senate.

According to the journalist Boris Casoy, from ♡❤Rede Record♡❤ Television channel, it can be seen written in some places in &lt;a href="w%3ABrasilia"&gt;Brasilia&lt;/a&gt; the name of the President Lula written as "Lulla" (with double "l"). The name of the former deposed President Fernando Collor de Mello also has a double "l".

In &lt;a href="w%3AS%C3%A3o%20Paulo"&gt;São Paulo&lt;/a&gt;, the labour union "Força Sindical" is organizing protests against corruption in Brasil. The other major labour "CUT", which is linked to Workers' Party, said that don't want to take part on it.

<h2>Lula's future</h2>

Until now, politicians, even those from opposition to the government , were trying to preserve the personal image of the President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. However, as new denountiations arise and the government has not succeed in explaining, the permanence of Lula in the Presidency becomes difficult, because of popular pressure.

It is also possible that all the inquiries finish in an inconclusive form, as has already happened with some old cases investigated by Brazilian Congress.

But, even if Congress and the Senate choose not to blame Lula, his reputation certainly will still remain harmed. According to Senator Antonio Carlos Magalhães (PFL), "Lula's re-election has gone." 

At present time, there is a general consensus that Lula will have to work hard if he wishes to get re-elected.

<h1>Italians vote on fertility referendum</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Italians%20vote%20on%20fertility%20referendum&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

On Sunday and Monday, &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italians&lt;/a&gt; will vote on a &lt;a href="w%3Areferendum"&gt;referendum&lt;/a&gt; that would the abolish certain rules of the law about medically assisted fertility treatment.

Italian Law 40 of February 19, 2004 ruled on some aspects of assisted fertility treatment and established some rigid limits. The law was approved by the majority of Parliament with the encouragement of the government. The opposition protested because there was no agreement among Parliament for such a law and there was also disagreement among the majority. The law was approved using an urgent mechanism of the parliament, an apparatus used only if there is an urgent need for a law. 

A Committee against the law has formed and asked for the Referendum.

There will be 4 different votes about 4 different aspects of the law.

The first of them is asking to remove the prohibition of doing scientific studies with embryonic cells. The second is the ban on donor sperm and eggs; the third is a ban on embryo screening for couples with hereditary diseases; and the fourth, the rule that only three embryos per treatment can be created, all of which have to be implanted at the same time.

The referendum is of abrogate type, the only type of referendum permitted by Italian law.

According to the Italian Law, in order for a law (or part of a law) to be abolished by a referendum, there must not only be a majority vote in favor of the abolishment, but also that the valid vote must be more than the majority of the people that have the right to vote.

Since it's easier for the referendum not to be approved due to lack of presence of voters rather than for the presence of the majority of the "no" vote, the party who wants to keep the law as it is currently, has now asked citizens "not to go vote" rather than to vote "no".

Even the Catholic Church asked its members to "not go to vote"; the &lt;a href="w%3APope%20Benedict%20XVI"&gt;Pope&lt;/a&gt; himself asked for that in an indirect way. The president of the Senate and other people in charge of important official positions took this position.

The opposition contested this behavior.

The intentions of &lt;a href="w%3AManchester%20United"&gt;Manchester United's&lt;/a&gt; new owner, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; sports tycoon &lt;a href="w%3AMalcolm%20Glazer"&gt;Malcolm Glazer&lt;/a&gt;, for the club have been revealed. Although spokespersons for Mr. Glazer (including his son) have stressed that nothing has been finalised, it appears that he intends to raise ticket prices, income, profits whilst capping spending on player transfers.

Mr. Glazer - who owns over 76.2% of the club's shares through his investment company, ♡❤Red Football♡❤ - enraged fans when he started to accumulate shares earlier this year in an attempt to gain control of the what amounts to the world's most successful football club. Manchester United has more fans, a higher market value, a more valuable and more widely recognised brand and is more profitable than any other football club in the world.

To gain control of the club, Glazer used borrowed money and he is set to transfer this money to the club's books when he gains full control. The borrowed money will result in large interest repayments - pushing the clubs finances into the red. To counter this Mr. Glazer apparently intends to raise ticket prices by about 50% and to increase revenues by 52% to £245.6m (from £161.5m this year) over the next five years. Apart from ticket price increases, this jump in revenue will be achieved by a 61% jump in match day sales, a 13% increase in &lt;a href="w%3Amedia"&gt;media&lt;/a&gt; sales, and a 76% rise in sales of &lt;a href="w%3Amerchandise"&gt;merchandise&lt;/a&gt; and other commercial activities.

As part of his plans, expenditure on player transfers will be capped at just £25m a year. This is a very low figure for a English football club endeavouring to win domestic and European trophies. Seven years ago the club spent £28m on players, since then expenditure in England on players has increased hugely.

Crown Prince of Kuwait Sheikh Saad al-Abdulla al-Sabah, was admitted to a hospital on Thursday due to a blood condition. According to the state news agency KUNA he has been suffering from a high level of blood glucose. In 1997 Sheikh Saad underwent colon surgery. 

Sheikh Saad has been crown prince since 1978. He was also prime minister until July 2003. In July 2003 the Emir replaced him with Sheik Sabah as prime minister. This appointment broke the tradition of crown princes also serving as heads of government. Both he and the Emir have made very few public appearances recently.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Irish%20inflation%20creeps%20upwards%20to%202.4%25&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The inflation rate in &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, as measured by the &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Statistics%20Office"&gt;Central Statistics Office&lt;/a&gt; (CSO), edged upwards to hit a five month high in May at 2.4%. This represents a 0.2% rise on the previous month when the rate stood at 2.2%.

The major contributors to the rise were increased transportation, healthcare, and education costs. In April the &lt;a href="w%3AEU25"&gt;EU25&lt;/a&gt; average rate of inflation was 2.1%, with &lt;a href="w%3ALatvia"&gt;Latvia&lt;/a&gt; having the highest rate at 7.1% and &lt;a href="w%3ASweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; the lowest at 0.4%.

Despite the increase in the rate, Irish inflation remains very low - having hit 7% during 2000 and remaining around the 5% until the beginning of 2003. Another major factor easing any worries about the increase is Ireland's very strong &lt;a href="w%3AGDP"&gt;GDP&lt;/a&gt; growth - expected to be around 5.5% this year

On an annual basis the cost of footwear and clothing have fallen by 2.7% whilst energy costs have soared by 10.4%. The cost of food, furniture, and communications also fell over the last 12 months.

&lt;a href="w%3ABSkyB"&gt;BSkyB&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; television broadcasting and transmission company, faces a serious rival bid from ♡❤Setanta Sports♡❤ for the rights to broadcast Premiership football. BSkyB, which dominates the satellite TV market, has held the rights to the broadcast Premier League games since 1992. They paid £1.02bn for its current three year contract.

Setanta has approached the managing director of BSkyB, Trevor East, with the intention of luring him to Setanta to lead the acquisition of sports rights. Mr East, who's contract runs out soon, has not yet made a decision, but should he decide to sign a contract with the &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt; station, it would be a massive boost to their ambitions.

Setanta initially started out by broadcasting &lt;a href="w%3AGAA"&gt;GAA&lt;/a&gt; games to Irish people living abroad particularly in the US. Today, backed by an investment by &lt;a href="w%3AAIG"&gt;AIG&lt;/a&gt;, it is pursuing an ambitious plan to grow its business - it currently broadcasts the Scottish Premier League and earlier this week it bought control of North American Sports Network. North American Sports Network broadcasts baseball, &lt;a href="w%3ANFL"&gt;NFL&lt;/a&gt; football, &lt;a href="w%3Abasketball"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANascar"&gt;Nascar&lt;/a&gt; motor racing outside the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;. Also in the planning stages is a &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;an sports station for the US market.

&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; air-strikes have killed an estimated 40 suspected &lt;a href="w%3AInsurgent"&gt;insurgents&lt;/a&gt; in western &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday, the US military has said. "Seven precision-guided U.S. air strikes on the outskirts of the town of &lt;a href="w%3AKarabilah"&gt;Karabilah&lt;/a&gt; killed the insurgents who were stopping vehicles at gunpoint and threatening Iraqi civilians," said a US military statement. It has not been confirmed that insurgents were stopping civilians at gunpoint.

The statement said that there were no US casualties and that no report of civilian casualties has been received in the area of the attacks, near Karabila, 300 km (186 miles) west of &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;.

Elsewhere, reports indicate a former Iraqi police commander blew himself up in a failed bid to assassinate the leader of the anti-insurgent "Wolf Brigade" in Baghdad, killing three other policemen in the attempt.

The &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; foreign affairs department has announced that the French journalist &lt;a href="w%3AFlorence%20Aubenas"&gt;Florence Aubenas&lt;/a&gt; (working on behalf of &lt;a href="w%3ALib%C3%A9ration"&gt;Libération&lt;/a&gt;) and her guide Hussein Hanoun Al-Saadi have been freed this morning.

They had been held hostage in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; since January 5, 2005 &amp;mdash; a total of 158 days.

French president &lt;a href="w%3AJacques%20Chirac"&gt;Jacques Chirac&lt;/a&gt; said in a televised speech that the freed French reporter and her Iraqi driver are in "good health" and said that Aubenas is on a plane heading for France.

A FSB spokesman said 12 people have been injured, when two carriages of a train heading from the &lt;a href="Chechnya"&gt;Chechen&lt;/a&gt; capital &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGrozny"&gt;Grozny&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; derailed 90 miles south of &lt;a href="Moscow"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt;.

Officials have reported that two people have been rushed to hospital, while others who sustained lighter injuries were offered medical assistance at the crash site and delivered to Moscow by commuter train. The spokesman did not say who might be responsible for the attack on the train, which at the time was carrying more than 300 passengers.

Only an hour prior to the incident, a train carrying elementary school pupils from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABeslan"&gt;Beslan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Ossetia"&gt;North Ossetia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on their way to &lt;a href="Croatia"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt; passed on the same track. 56 children were heading to a Moscow airport, from where they flew to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AZagreb"&gt;Zagreb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . In September last year, 172 children died in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABeslan%20school%20hostage%20crisis"&gt;Beslan school hostage crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

At least 91 people have now been confirmed dead in Friday's disaster, in which a wall of water and debris smashed into the school near Ning'an, in the northern Heilongjiang province. Hundreds of children and more than 30 teachers of the school, were inside at the time.

Of the dead, reports from the Xinhua news agency say that 87 were students and four were adults. The reports also indicate that two dozen people are still in a criticial condition in hospital.

The flooding itself, triggered by heavy rain caused damage in several cities near Ning'an city, knocking down up to 55 houses.

Four separate bombs have exploded in the south-western &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;ian city of &lt;a href="w%3AAhwaz"&gt;Ahwaz&lt;/a&gt;, killing more than five people and wounding up to 87 others. The presidential election is due in five days time.

Later, an additional bomb was detonated in &lt;a href="w%3ATeheran"&gt;Teheran&lt;/a&gt;, killing three and wounding several others.

Earlier news reports reported a lower number, but reports from two major international agencies are now reporting much higher injury numbers. Bombings in Iran have been extremely rare, since the war with &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; ended in 1988.

One bomb exploded outside the governor general's office. Three more bombs exploded near government buildings in a period of two hours. Some reports put the official death toll at eight, and official reports confirm that up to 30 were injured; but final numbers are not yet known.

"We cannot say for now who committed these attacks, but the intelligence ministry is investigating," The deputy governor of Khuzestan said in a statement to state television. He went on to say that "The attacks are a failure, because in the past the regime has been confronted by far worse."

The Ahwaz attacks have been claimed by a previously unknown group known as the "Ahwazi Revolutionary Martyrs' Brigades," while a group protesting the bombings outside the Khuzestan governor's residence chanted "Death to the hypocrites" - a slogan applied to the &lt;a href="w%3AMojahedin-e-Khalq"&gt;Mojahedin-e-Khalq&lt;/a&gt; (MeK) organization. 

Ali Agha Mohammadi, head press secretary for the security services at first refused to implicate the MeK in the attacks, but later asserted that the bombs “may have been the work of people who belong to the &lt;nowiki&gt;[Mojahedin]&lt;/nowiki&gt;." The MeK, which has admitted responsibility for previous attacks, have disclaimed any part in the latest string of bombings. 

The MeK is currently listed as a &lt;a href="w%3AForeign%20Terrorist%20Organisation"&gt;Foreign Terrorist Organisation&lt;/a&gt; by the U.S. State Department and has received similar designations from other governments and the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;. However, according to two prominent security analysts, the bombings seen this weekend are not their style. “These don’t have the MeK’s fingerprints on them,” according to Mustafa Akmal. “The MeK has not engaged in any violent action for the past four years,” he said, adding “Even before ceasing its armed activities in Iran, it had a policy of claiming responsibility for all its operations.” 

Akmal's colleague, Walter Murray of the &lt;a href="w%3AGulf%20Intelligence%20Monitor"&gt;Gulf Intelligence Monitor&lt;/a&gt; agreed, saying it would be foolish for the group to alienate potential supporters in the West and endanger the fruits of years of lobbying western governments with such attacks. Murray felt the bombers were more likely "...loose cannons..." in Iran's military or intelligence services.

According to Iranian top national security official Ali Agha Mohammadi, "the terrorists of Ahvaz infiltrated Iran from the region of Basra" in southern Iraq." He added that "these terrorists have been trained under the umbrella of the Americans in Iraq."

These attacks seem to represent a new capability of anti-Tehran forces to strike inside of Iran that did not exist before the US invasion and occupation of Iraq.

There has been no official US denunciation of the attacks.

On Thursday, &lt;a href="Missouri"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMissouri%20Circuit%20Court"&gt;Circuit Court&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Judge Werner Moentmann ruled that &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APlanned%20Parenthood"&gt;Planned Parenthood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKansas"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and Planned Parenthood of Mid-Missouri must repay the state of &lt;a href="Missouri"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt; $668,850 for grants they received illegally for fiscal years 2000 and 2003. The Judge said that the Planned Parenthood groups shared "office space, expenses, employee wages, equipment and supplies" with doctors who performed abortions and therefore was ineligible for the grant money.

This is the third time the case has come before a circuit judge &amp;mdash; twice previously circuit court judges ruled that Planned Parenthood was not eligible for grant funding from Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. 

The Missouri Supreme Court overturned two previous rulings without addressing the merits of the case itself. The first ruling urged the lower court to reconsider the decision based on changes in federal law; the second ruling was overturned when the court found that Attorney General Jay Nixon had a conflict of interest in representing both the state legislature and the health department.

<h1>Mike Tyson set to retire after loss</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Mike%20Tyson%20set%20to%20retire%20after%20loss&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Tyson"&gt;Mike Tyson's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aboxing"&gt;boxing&lt;/a&gt; career appears to be over after the infamous fighter became fatigued against his journeyman opponent Saturday. Tyson later told the media he was quitting the sport to become a missionary.

Despite being heavily favored, the 38-year old Tyson became desperate in the sixth round and resorted to his trademark bizarre tactics against &lt;a href="w%3AIreland"&gt;Irishman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20McBride"&gt;Kevin McBride&lt;/a&gt; (33-4-1). When an attempt to break his opponent's arm failed to end the fight, Tyson landed a head-butt that opened a cut near McBride's left eye. Still desperate and low on stamina, Tyson proceeded to hit below the belt before sagging to the canvas in the closing seconds of the round. When Tyson refused to answer the bell for the seventh, veteran referee Joe Cortez "looked stunned," according to the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABoston%20Globe"&gt;Boston Globe's&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ Ron Borges. Tyson led on two cards and trailed on a third when the fight was called, but he was clearly out of gas and momentum was not with him. 

"I do not have the stomach for this," Tyson told Showtime interviewer Jim Gray after leaving the ring. "I don't have the guts to be in this sport anymore. My heart is not into this anymore." He also apologized to the 15,472 paid attendance at the &lt;a href="w%3AMCI%20Center"&gt;MCI Center&lt;/a&gt; "whom had roared his name when he entered the ring less than an hour earlier," according to Borges.

The $5 million payday will erase only a fraction of an enormous debt that caused Tyson to declare bankruptcy in 2003. One report says he owes more than $40 million &lt;a href="http%3A//sport.scotsman.com/latest.cfm%3Fid%3D4680237"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

The disgraced former champion also told reporters he is "going to look into my missionary work," according to &lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;. "There is some &lt;a href="w%3AChristian"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt; missionary work that was interested in letting me come to &lt;a href="w%3ABosnia"&gt;Bosnia&lt;/a&gt;, go to &lt;a href="w%3ARwanda"&gt;Rwanda&lt;/a&gt;, go to different countries to help with aid and food for people that are in dire need."

American millionaire and adventurer &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Fossett"&gt;Steve Fossett&lt;/a&gt; and his co-pilot Mark Rebholz are planning to recreate &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Alcock%20%28aviator%29"&gt;John Alcock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AArthur%20Whitten%20Brown"&gt;Arthur Whitten Brown's&lt;/a&gt; historic &lt;a href="w%3AAlcock%20and%20Brown"&gt;first non-stop transatlantic flight&lt;/a&gt; of 1919.

Following the original route, the pair hope to leave Lester's Field in &lt;a href="w%3ANewfoundland"&gt;Newfoundland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; next weekend and fly to &lt;a href="w%3AClifden"&gt;Clifden&lt;/a&gt; on the west coast of &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. They intend to land at the Ballyconneely golf links near the Irish town. However, the date of departure, 19 June, is very much weather dependent because the pilots will be relying solely on the sun and stars for direction &amp;mdash; no instruments are being used for navigation.

The trip, which will be completely in a replica &lt;a href="w%3AVickers%20Vimy"&gt;Vickers Vimy&lt;/a&gt;, will take approximately 20 hours to complete. The Vickers Vimy was originally designed as a &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20War%20One"&gt;World War One&lt;/a&gt; bomber. This particular plane has already been used to recreate significant journeys; having flown from &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; in 1994, and from England to &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; in 1999.

<h2>Steve Fossett</h2>

Mr. Fossett is a multimillionaire who earned his fortune in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; financial markets. He holds 15 &lt;a href="w%3Aworld%20record"&gt;world record&lt;/a&gt; passages in sailing &amp;mdash; including the record for fastest &lt;a href="w%3ACircumnavigation"&gt;circumnavigation&lt;/a&gt; of the world. He was the first person ever to fly a solo, non-stop, aerial circumnavigation of the globe in a jet aircraft. He has also swum the &lt;a href="w%3AEnglish%20Channel"&gt;English Channel&lt;/a&gt; and driven the &lt;a href="w%3A24%20hours%20of%20Le%20Mans"&gt;24 hours of Le Mans&lt;/a&gt;.

The adventurer also holds the interesting distinction of holding more world records than anyone else &amp;mdash; currently 62 world records.

Organizers of the upcoming &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ALive%208"&gt;Live 8&lt;/a&gt; concert have announced that legendary rock band &lt;a href="w%3APink%20Floyd"&gt;Pink Floyd&lt;/a&gt; plans to perform on July 2. Guitarist &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Gilmour"&gt;David Gilmour&lt;/a&gt;, bassist &lt;a href="w%3ARoger%20Waters"&gt;Roger Waters&lt;/a&gt;, drummer &lt;a href="w%3ANick%20Mason"&gt;Nick Mason&lt;/a&gt;, and keyboardist &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Wright"&gt;Richard Wright&lt;/a&gt; will play their first performance together since playing at &lt;a href="w%3AEarls%20Court"&gt;Earls Court&lt;/a&gt;, London in 1981.

The band will come together, along with other musical acts such as &lt;a href="w%3AColdplay"&gt;Coldplay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AElton%20John"&gt;Elton John&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20McCartney"&gt;Paul McCartney&lt;/a&gt; for this event. Live 8 is a series of free concerts at each of the &lt;a href="w%3AG8"&gt;G8&lt;/a&gt; nations organized by &lt;a href="Bob%20Geldof"&gt;Bob Geldof&lt;/a&gt;. These concerts, set on the 20th anniversary of Geldof's &lt;a href="w%3ALive%20Aid"&gt;Live Aid&lt;/a&gt;, have been planned to support the &lt;a href="w%3AMake%20Poverty%20History"&gt;Make Poverty History&lt;/a&gt; campaign, which aims to reduce African poverty. 

This lineup of Pink Floyd has not played together for 24 years due to a conflict between David Gilmour and Roger Waters over leadership and creative influence of the band. However, it seems that they are willing to put their differences behind to support Live 8; "Like most people I want to do everything I can to persuade the G8 leaders to make huge commitments to the relief of poverty and increased aid to the third world," said David Gilmour and added, "Any squabbles Roger and the band have had in the past are so petty in this context, and if reforming for this concert will help focus attention then it's got to be worthwhile."

Decomposing bodies of twenty men have been found in a shallow grave in Nahrawan near Baghdad, Iraqi police officials report.

The men, who were aged between 20 and 50 were thought to have died quite some time ago. Police have not yet been able to identify the bodies, because of their physical state. Reports indicate that no identification was found at the scene.

Correspondents for the UK news agency, the &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;, say that there is an increasing number of unexplained murders in and around &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;, with bodies frequently dumped on the side of the road.

In &lt;a href="w%3AOshkosh%2C%20Wisconsin"&gt;Oshkosh, Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;, the Democratic Party of Wisconsin adopted the following resolution at their state convention:

The resolution alleges that the Bush administration "lied or misled" Congress and the American people concerning the justification for the war. The "Downing Street memo" and reports from U.N. weapons inspectors are mentioned as evidence of deception.

Newly elected state party Chairman Joe Wineke said, "Democrats, not only in Wisconsin but throughout the U.S., have been outraged by what we believe has been a clear cover-up of why the U.S. went into Iraq," and that the resolution expresses "the sense of frustration that Democrats in Wisconsin have over fighting a war for the wrong reasons."

Charles Franklin, a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor does not think the resolution will be successful and said that even if the House of Representatives began impeachment proceedings against the president and vice president, "I don't think you can impeach the secretary of defense".

<h1>Final withdrawal of Australian troops from East Timor</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Final%20withdrawal%20of%20Australian%20troops%20from%20East%20Timor&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n defence force handed the deeds to an ADF (&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Defence%20Force"&gt;Australian Defence Force&lt;/a&gt;) base in &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Timor"&gt;East Timor&lt;/a&gt; back to the country's government today, representing the end of armed peacekeeping in the country. The ADF says almost all their personnel will be out of the country within a fortnight. A small number will remain as part of a defence cooperation program between the two nations.

The East Timorese Prime Minister and other dignitaries were present for the handing over of the deeds. Troops from the armed forces of both Australia and East Timor paraded together while the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20flag"&gt;Australian flag&lt;/a&gt; was lowered.

The Molena base, near the border with West Timor, has been operated by the ADF for the past three years. The site will now become a school.

A senior lecturer in international relations and strategy from the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20National%20University"&gt;Australian National University&lt;/a&gt;, Doctor Michael McKinley, said "Although there's going to be a defence presence left in the country ... the peacekeeping presence could perhaps have been extended, particularly if there are any reservations whatsoever in the East Timorese Government about their ongoing security concerns. My understanding is that there are certainly some concerns still remaining." 

"For the sort of psychological security of the East Timorese and perhaps even as a general message to the residue of trouble making, I thought perhaps Australia might have stayed somewhat longer," he said.

Lieutenant Colonel Brian Cox, commander of the ADF in East Timor, says he believes the country is being left in safe hands.

"We came in here in a period of turmoil in 1999 with &lt;a href="w%3AINTERFET"&gt;INTERFET&lt;/a&gt; and General (Peter) Cosgrove leading the 5,000 Australians then, and we're now leaving with economic prosperity now in place," he said.

&lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt; low cost airline, &lt;a href="w%3ARyanair"&gt;Ryanair&lt;/a&gt;, announced today that it is exercising its options with &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing"&gt;Boeing&lt;/a&gt; to purchase five new 737 aircraft. This brings Ryanair's total number of outstanding orders with the US manufacturer to 230.

The new planes, which come from the 737-800 range, will be fitted with blended &lt;a href="w%3AWinglet"&gt;winglets&lt;/a&gt; to boost fuel efficiency by as much as 3%. Ryanair &lt;a href="w%3ACEO"&gt;CEO&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20O%27Leary"&gt;Michael O'Leary&lt;/a&gt;, justified his choice of Boeing by saying, "The &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20737-800"&gt;Boeing 737-800&lt;/a&gt; has the best technical reliability and ensures that Ryanair is the number one on-time major airline in Europe"..."In addition, it has the lowest unit operating cost. The addition of these five aircraft will continue to enable us to develop more new routes across Europe and bring low fares to many more &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;an consumers."

Ryanair is the world's most profitable airline, having reported record profits of €269m earlier this year, and is pursuing an aggressive expansion plan which will see it's total number of passengers jump to 70m over the next few years. At present Ryanair has 91 aircraft and 230 on order.

&lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;an aircraft manufacturer, &lt;a href="w%3AAirbus"&gt;Airbus&lt;/a&gt;, has won an order from &lt;a href="w%3AQatar%20Airways"&gt;Qatar Airways&lt;/a&gt; for up to 60 of its new mid-sized A350 jets. The order, which is believed to be worth $15 billion, has given a boost to an otherwise disappointing &lt;a href="w%3AParis%20Air%20Show"&gt;Paris Air Show&lt;/a&gt;, which had been dominated by a state aid dispute between Airbus and &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing"&gt;Boeing&lt;/a&gt;.

Qatar Airways, which choose the &lt;a href="w%3AAirbus%20A350"&gt;Airbus A350&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20787"&gt;Boeing's 787&lt;/a&gt;, will also purchase 20 of Boeing's larger 777 planes for $4.6 billion. Qatar has a previous order for 2 of Airbus' massive new &lt;a href="w%3AAirbus%20A380"&gt;A380's&lt;/a&gt; which it will begin to fly in 2009 out of &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Heathrow"&gt;London Heathrow&lt;/a&gt;.

In 2004, Airbus sold more planes than Boeing for the first time ever, sparking questions whether the US company had lost its once seemingly impregnable grip on the aviation market. However thus far, Boeing has received far more orders than Airbus in 2005.

The jury hearing the &lt;a href="w%3A2005%20trial%20of%20Michael%20Jackson"&gt;Michael Jackson trial&lt;/a&gt; has come to a final decision today, drawing to a close the long and widely hyped trial centering on the famous performer.

On this June 13, 2005, the jury in the &lt;a href="w%3A2005%20trial%20of%20Michael%20Jackson"&gt;Michael Jackson trial&lt;/a&gt; announced a verdict of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3Aacquittal"&gt;not guilty&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ on all 10 counts. The charges which were brought up against &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Jackson"&gt;Jackson&lt;/a&gt; included:

<ul>
BULLET::::- One count of conspiracy to commit child abduction, false imprisonment or extortion: ♡❤Not guilty♡❤
BULLET::::- Four counts of lewd acts with a child under 14: ♡❤Not guilty♡❤
BULLET::::- One count of attempted lewd act on child under 14: ♡❤Not guilty♡❤
BULLET::::- Four counts of giving alcohol to enable child molestation: ♡❤Not guilty♡❤

</ul>
Emotional jurors of the case, some shedding a tear or two at the verdict's reading, stated that while they initially did not expect the decision to be made by today, they all felt that the decision made was the correct one, and that they indeed had more than 'reasonable doubt' about the claims against the performer. 

For a juror to return a verdict of ♡❤not guilty♡❤, the US judicial system dictates that they should have ♡❤reasonable doubt♡❤ about whether or not the individual has performed the alleged actions. The jurors said that they did this, also commenting that they kept a close eye on the instruction pages provided to them by the judge, often referring back to them when discussing evidence in the case which contributed to the final outcome.

&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Jackson"&gt;Jackson&lt;/a&gt; left the courtroom without comment to reporters, and has remained silent since.

French police are holding a 31-year-old who managed to convince social workers and fellow students that he was a 15-year-old Spanish orphan and spent a whole month attending school. &lt;a href="http%3A//news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4087370.stm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Frederic Bourdin's alias was discovered when a teacher watched a television program about his exploits and his numerous identities. 

Claire Chadourne, headmistress at the College Jean-Monnet, said, "He seemed a little older than his classmates, two or three years at the most. But 31. I still can't believe it!"

Bourdin, who speaks at least five languages, told social workers and classmates that his name was Francisco Hernandez-Fernandez and that his parents had been killed in a car crash in 2000 and that he'd spent three months in a coma. He claimed that after being placed into foster care, he was sexually abused and that he escaped to France. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.guardian.co.uk/france/story/0%2C11882%2C1504916%2C00.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

He told his teacher that he had horrible scars that he wished to hide and was given special permission to wear a cap to hide his balding.

Bourdin is said to have assumed 39 other false identities in the past. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml%3Fxml%3D/news/2005/06/13/wcham13.xml%26amp%3BsSheet%3D/portal/2005/06/13/ixportal.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

In 1997, Bourdin was arrested and imprisoned for six years in the United States for posing a Texas couple's 14-year-old son, who disappeared three years earlier. He managed to convince the couple that he was their son even though he had brown eyes and a heavy French accent.

The couple's son had blue eyes.

Bourdin lived with the couple for three months before a journalist exposed him and his lies were confirmed by a DNA test.

Returning from the United States in 2003, Bourdin showed up in the southeastern Alps, where he claimed to be Leo Balley, who went missing in 1996 when he was seven-years-old and camping with his father.

Once again, a DNA test revealed his lies. 

Bourdin said, "I have only usurped the identities of two disappeared children. Otherwise 99% of the names are completely made up." &lt;a href="http%3A//www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml%3Fxml%3D/news/2005/06/13/wcham13.xml%26amp%3BsSheet%3D/portal/2005/06/13/ixportal.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

He says he assumes other identities as a way of receiving the attention he never got as a child. 

Bourdin is slated to appear in court in September.

A new Earth-like &lt;a href="w%3Aplanet"&gt;planet&lt;/a&gt;, called &lt;a href="w%3AGliese%20876%23Planets"&gt;Gliese 876 d&lt;/a&gt;, has been discovered orbiting a &lt;a href="w%3Astar"&gt;star&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href="w%3AGliese%20876"&gt;Gliese 876&lt;/a&gt; about 15 &lt;a href="w%3ALight%20year"&gt;light years&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3AEarth"&gt;Earth&lt;/a&gt;. It is the first rocky planet to be discovered orbiting a star, although three other rocky planets have in the past been discovered in orbit around a &lt;a href="w%3Apulsar"&gt;pulsar&lt;/a&gt;. There are two other &lt;a href="w%3Agas"&gt;gaseous&lt;/a&gt;, Jupiter-like planets in orbit around the same star.

"This is the smallest &lt;a href="w%3Aextrasolar%20planet"&gt;extrasolar planet&lt;/a&gt; yet detected and the first of a new class of rocky terrestrial planets," said Paul Butler of the &lt;a href="w%3ACarnegie%20Institution%20of%20Washington"&gt;Carnegie Institution&lt;/a&gt;, one of the teams that discovered the new planet. "It's like Earth's bigger cousin."

The newly discovered world has about 7½ times the &lt;a href="w%3Amass"&gt;mass&lt;/a&gt; of Earth. Its orbital period, or "year", is a mere 2 days in length and its path takes it 10 times closer to its star than the closest planet is to our &lt;a href="w%3ASun"&gt;Sun&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="w%3Atemperature"&gt;temperature&lt;/a&gt; on the surface is estimated between 400 to 750 degrees &lt;a href="w%3AFahrenheit"&gt;Fahrenheit&lt;/a&gt; (200 to 400 degrees &lt;a href="w%3ACelsius"&gt;Celsius&lt;/a&gt;), and is too hot for &lt;a href="w%3Alifeform"&gt;life forms&lt;/a&gt; that are similar to those found on Earth.

"A planet seven and a half times the mass of the Earth could easily hold onto an &lt;a href="w%3ACelestial%20body%20atmosphere"&gt;atmosphere&lt;/a&gt;," explained Gregory Laughlin, an assistant professor of astronomy at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20California%2C%20Santa%20Cruz"&gt;University of California in Santa Cruz&lt;/a&gt;. "It would still be considered a rocky planet, probably with an &lt;a href="w%3Airon"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APlanetary%20core"&gt;core&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="w%3Asilicate"&gt;silicate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMantle%20%28geology%29"&gt;mantle&lt;/a&gt;. It could even have a dense &lt;a href="w%3Asteam"&gt;steamy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Awater"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; layer. I think what we are seeing here is something that's intermediate between a true &lt;a href="w%3Aterrestrial%20planet"&gt;terrestrial planet&lt;/a&gt; like the Earth and a hot version of the ice giants &lt;a href="w%3AUranus%20%28planet%29"&gt;Uranus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANeptune%20%28planet%29"&gt;Neptune&lt;/a&gt;."

&lt;a href="w%3AAstronomer"&gt;Astronomers&lt;/a&gt; are continuing to advance the science of detecting extrasolar worlds. "We are pushing a whole new regime at &lt;a href="w%3AKeck%20telescopes"&gt;Keck&lt;/a&gt; [Observatory in Hawaii] to achieve one &lt;a href="w%3ARadial%20velocity"&gt;meter per second precision&lt;/a&gt;, triple our old precision, that should also allow us to see Earth-mass planets around sun-like stars within the next few years," Butler said.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20High%20Commissioner%20for%20Refugees"&gt;United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees&lt;/a&gt; has criticised the governments of &lt;a href="w%3ARwanda"&gt;Rwanda&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABurundi"&gt;Burundi&lt;/a&gt; for their decision to mutually re-label each others &lt;a href="w%3Aasylum%20seeker"&gt;asylum seekers&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href="w%3Aillegal%20immigrant"&gt;illegal immigrants&lt;/a&gt;. The UNHCR is concerned that the rights of asylum seekers may be abused.

"If they are summarily sent back without a proper procedure to determine whether or not they are refugees, then that could well be in contravention of international refugee law, and in particular the 1951 UN Refugee Convention and the 1969 OAU Convention," a UNHCR press release said.

In a joint press release, both countries declared that the asylum seekers had left their countries "without good reason," and were therefore illegal immigrants.

The Rwandan asylum seekers began arriving in Burundi in March. Their main concern was the &lt;a href="w%3AGacaca%20courts"&gt;Gacaca courts&lt;/a&gt;, however the UNHCR is also reporting that some asylum seekers "... said they were fleeing threats, intimidation, persecution and rumours of revenge and bloodshed."

Earlier this week the Rwandan government put the number of asylum seekers at 2,000, and accused the UNHCR of exaggerating the size of the refugee problem, and thus causing more people to flee.

There are 8,000 Rwandan asylum seekers in Burundi, and nearly 7,000 Burundians in Rwanda, according to the UNHCR.

The international medical aid group &lt;a href="w%3AM%C3%A9decins%20Sans%20Fronti%C3%A8res"&gt;Médecins Sans Frontières&lt;/a&gt; (MSF) has claimed in a press release that its medical staff have been prevented from accessing their clinic inside the Songore transit camp. The camp holds almost 7,000 &lt;a href="w%3ARwanda"&gt;Rwandan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aasylum%20seekers"&gt;asylum seekers&lt;/a&gt;, who were receiving more than 100 medical consultations a day from MSF staff. MSF claims that the camp is now guarded by the &lt;a href="w%3ABurundi"&gt;Burundese&lt;/a&gt; military.

"It's unacceptable that our medical staff are denied access to our own health facility in Songore camp, denying medical care to the people in the camp. Also, by transporting these people back to Rwanda, MSF is not able to continue the medical care for those that were already under treatment. Some families have even been split apart because of family members being referred to a nearby hospital," says Michiel Hofman, operational director for MSF.

"MSF is very concerned about what can be seen as a forced repatriation where the basic rights of an asylum seeker are being denied", he added.

This action appears to be part of a wider crackdown on asylum seekers from Rwanda and Burundi. The &lt;a href="w%3AUNHCR"&gt;UNHCR&lt;/a&gt; recently criticised the two governments after they issued a joint press release which declared that asylum seekers in each others countries did not have a legitimate claim and therefore were illegal immigrants rather than refugees.

The Rwandan asylum seekers began arriving in Burundi in March. Their main concern was the &lt;a href="w%3AGacaca%20courts"&gt;Gacaca courts&lt;/a&gt;, however the UNHCR is also reporting that some asylum seekers "... said they were fleeing threats, intimidation, persecution and rumours of revenge and bloodshed."

The President of Rwanda, &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Kagame"&gt;Paul Kagame&lt;/a&gt;, has previously called for the asylum seekers to return home, stating that they will not be in danger.

"Gacaca is not intended to have all the people who appear at Gacaca arrested and put in prison. We want these people to show remorse and through that they will provide information and will allow people to forgive them and allow them to settle," he said.

There are 8,000 Rwandan asylum seekers in Burundi, and nearly 7,000 Burundians in Rwanda, according to the UNHCR.

The &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20High%20Commissioner%20for%20Refugees"&gt;High Commissioner for Refugees&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is reporting that thousands of &lt;a href="Rwanda"&gt;Rwanda&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aasylum%20seekers"&gt;asylum seekers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; who fled to neighbouring &lt;a href="Burundi"&gt;Burundi&lt;/a&gt; over the last few months have been forced to return home. Trucks laden with people have been seen leaving the camp, and some people have broken limbs after allegedly jumping to avoid returning to Rwanda.

According to a press release, the UNHCR was denied access to the Songore transit centre in northern Burundi, making verification difficult. The camp was home to at least 6,000 asylum seekers until last week. The Rwandan and Burundian governments met over the weekend and declared in a joint press release that the asylum seekers were not refugees but "illegal immigrants".

"Nothing justifies the presence of these people in Burundi. Rwanda is in peace and there is no persecution," said Burundian Interior Minister Jean Marie Ngendahayo.

This claim has been criticised by the UNHCR, which has stated that it would be illegal to return the people without first assessing their claim to asylum. &lt;a href="Amnesty%20International"&gt;Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt; has also claimed that Burundi's actions are contrary to international law.

"The use of verbal or physical threats to induce people to return to countries where they fear persecution is in complete contravention of international law &amp;mdash; in particular the binding principle of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Anon-refoulement"&gt;non-refoulement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ," said Kolawole Olaniyan, Director of Amnesty International's Africa Programme.

"We urge the government of Burundi to implement fair and transparent asylum procedures to establish the risks of return for every single person claiming asylum &amp;mdash; as is their duty under international law," he added.

This action appears to be part of a wider crackdown on asylum seekers from Rwanda and Burundi. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), an international aid group, reported yesterday that their medical staff had been denied access to the Songore camp.

The Rwandan asylum seekers began arriving in Burundi in March. Their main concern was the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGacaca%20courts"&gt;Gacaca courts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , village courts established to expedite prosecution of perpretators of the 1994 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARwandan%20genocide"&gt;Rwandan genocide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The UNHCR is also reporting that some asylum seekers "... said they were fleeing threats, intimidation, persecution and rumours of revenge and bloodshed."

The President of Rwanda, &lt;a href="Paul%20Kagame"&gt;Paul Kagame&lt;/a&gt;, has previously called for the asylum seekers to return home, stating that they will not be in danger.

"Gacaca is not intended to have all the people who appear at Gacaca arrested and put in prison. We want these people to show remorse and through that they will provide information and will allow people to forgive them and allow them to settle," he said.

A Wikinews reporter was in Butare recently talking to the locals. She says that the mood is generally supportive of the courts.

"People here believe in the Gacaca process. They say that people have fled now because the investigations are reaching their end and people now know that the are going to be exposed in the process. They have heard 'rumours' that may have been circulated by former leaders of the genocide &amp;mdash; or there may not have been rumours they may merely fear the trials - that there will be reprisals and violence," she said.

Some people fear reprisals after testifying before the courts.

"Fear is also experienced by those facing testimonies at the Gacaca trial: the widows etc. who will testify against their neighbours. I have been told by several people that high levels of security have been put into place in villages to protect people from revenge attacks for testifying or for being involved," she added.

There are 8,000 Rwandan asylum seekers in Burundi, and nearly 7,000 Burundians in Rwanda, according to the UNHCR.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Chinese%20bloggers%20on%20Microsoft%27s%20MSN%20now%20face%20regulation%20of%20censors&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

As of Tuesday, &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Ablogger"&gt;bloggers&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AMSN"&gt;MSN&lt;/a&gt; service will face the scrutiny of automated &lt;a href="w%3Acensor"&gt;censors&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft is changing the Chinese version of its blogging portal MSN Spaces to reject certain words deemed contentious &amp;mdash; words such as 'democracy', 'freedom', 'human rights', and '&lt;a href="w%3APolitical%20status%20of%20Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan independence&lt;/a&gt;'. The company states that the purpose of this action is to comply with local laws in China, a country with heavy regulation of online speech. This follows on the heels of an earlier action taken by the government of the &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; that required all Chinese &lt;a href="w%3Ablogger"&gt;bloggers&lt;/a&gt; to register their web journals with the government.

Ever since the &lt;a href="w%3ACommunist%20Party%20of%20China"&gt;Communist Party of China&lt;/a&gt; (CPC) took control of the government in 1945, the press has been strictly regulated, but with the advent of the &lt;a href="w%3AInternet"&gt;internet&lt;/a&gt;, there were worries on the part of the CPC on whether their influence on the Chinese &lt;a href="w%3Apress"&gt;media&lt;/a&gt; would hold. As Chinese officials called for a more regulated internet, outsiders dismissed such regulation as impossible and contradictory of what the internet stands for. Yet government censorship prevailed with the installation of a complex system of proxies and firewalls (colloquially known as the &lt;a href="w%3AGreat%20Firewall%20of%20China"&gt;Great Firewall of China&lt;/a&gt;), blocking Chinese internet users from accessing sites that ran counter to the censorship policy. A further crackdown in 2003 resulted in the closure of many internet cafés and the arrest of dozens of users.

With this recent action, Microsoft has come under scrutiny by &lt;a href="w%3AReporters%20Without%20Borders"&gt;Reporters Without Borders&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft has issued a statement saying that it is its policy to comply with local laws and regulations of each country where it operates. Microsoft is not the only company obliging to the censorship policy of the People's Republic of China &amp;mdash; &lt;a href="w%3ANortel"&gt;Nortel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AYahoo%21"&gt;Yahoo!&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; have been criticised for similar measures. Google was blocked by the Chinese censors for some amount of time in the past, as has been &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, the sister project of Wikinews.

<h1>Bombings reported in southeastern Iran</h1>

Three separate explosions have been reported in Zahedan, a city in southeast &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;i borders. Reports indicate that the bombings gave minor injuries to three people and caused some damage to houses. One of the blasts reportedly occurred at approximately 4:30 am, with the other two preceding shortly before.

The attack is part of a series of bombings that have occurred shortly before the Iranian presidential election. Blasts in Tehran and the southwestern city of Ahvaz on Sunday killed a total of 10 people. Despite these grave attacks, Iranian officials are asserting that the turnout for the election will not be impaired. At a Monday press conference, intelligence minister Ali Younessi said, ""[The] Sunday morning and evening [attacks] in Ahvaz and Tehran are not going to have any effect on people's presence at presidential election polls."

<h1>South African president dismisses deputy on implications of corruption</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=South%20African%20president%20dismisses%20deputy%20on%20implications%20of%20corruption&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Today at about 1600 UTC/GMT, &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20South%20Africa"&gt;South African President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AThabo%20Mbeki"&gt;Thabo Mbeki&lt;/a&gt; announced in a special session of parliament that he has taken action he feels is necessary, that is to "release &lt;nowiki&gt;[his deputy president]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJacob%20Zuma"&gt;Jacob Zuma&lt;/a&gt;, from his responsibilities as deputy president of the republic and member of the cabinet".

Zuma was implicated in corruption arising from his relationship with his former financial adviser, Schabir Shaik, who was convicted of corruption and fraud earlier this month. Shaik was found guilty by Durban High Court of two counts of corruption and one of fraud and was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment.

The President has called this one of his toughest decisions. Opposition leader of the Democratic Alliance immediately praised the president for holding "principle over politics", and, while deeply saddened, former president &lt;a href="w%3ANelson%20Mandela"&gt;Nelson Mandela&lt;/a&gt; supported Mbeki's decision. Jacob Zuma was the favourite of the ruling &lt;a href="w%3AAfrican%20National%20Congress"&gt;African National Congress&lt;/a&gt; party to succeed Thabo Mbeki as president.

Following this ordeal, the government of South Africa has reaffirmed its dedication to the reduction and eventual elimination of corruption in all areas of politics.

UPDATE (July 7)

The African National Congress held a meeting of it's National General Council over the weekend of 2-3 July. Zuma attracted a lot of favourable attention, mostly from people who wished to defeat policy initiatives that included relaxing some of the legal constraints on employers. He was reinstated as ANC deputy president and, in a first for the party, granted a salary (details not revealed). It now appears that Jacob Zuma's political future is closely tied to that of the "left wing" of the ANC.

Details emerged on Tuesday that the &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; military hosted the first gay military marriage in &lt;a href="North%20America"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt; at an airbase in Nova Scotia in May. A sergeant and a warrant officer, who didn't want to be identified, were married on May 3 by a United Church minister in front of about 45 guests at Greenwood airbase.

Lt. Cmdr David Greenwood, the base's Anglican chaplain, said he could not officiate but said he arranged the service and preached at the wedding. Greenwood said the wedding might encourage other gays and lesbians to come forward and make their vows official. Most Anglican dioceses in Canada don't perform &lt;a href="w%3ASame-sex%20marriage"&gt;same-sex marriages&lt;/a&gt;, but has postponed its official decision on the matter until 2007.

A National Defence spokeswoman confirmed this was the first gay wedding in the military's history. Currently, same-sex marriages are recognized and performed in seven provinces and one territory across Canada.

In 2004, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the federal government has exclusive jurisdiction to decide who has the right to marry in Canada. Prime Minister Paul Martin said the government would pursue legalizing same-sex marriage across the country this year. The government's same-sex marriage bill passed its second reading in the House of Commons in May.

A major earthquake hit &lt;a href="Chile"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt; on Monday with a 7.9 magnitude strength. According to the Reuters news service, the earthquake caused a major displacement of homes and caused major power outages. So far, there have been 11 dead in the quake and aftermath.

The epicentre was 115 km at the northeast of the of &lt;a href="w%3AIquique"&gt;Iquique&lt;/a&gt;, close to the border with &lt;a href="w%3ABolivia"&gt;Bolivia&lt;/a&gt;, and it happened Monday, at 6:45 p.m. local time (22:45 UTC).

Right after the occurrence of the earthquake, schools were evacuated, panic was generalized and the electrical power has been cut. The earthquake could be felt at the south of &lt;a href="w%3APeru"&gt;Peru&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABolivia"&gt;Bolivia&lt;/a&gt;, but there are not information about victims or damages in these countries. A very small earthquake was felt in some cities in &lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;, with no damages or victims apparently.

The &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; division of &lt;a href="w%3AeBay"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt; announced yesterday that it was removing all listings for sale of tickets for ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALive%208"&gt;Live 8&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ from its &lt;tt&gt;eBay.co.uk&lt;/tt&gt; site. Whilst asserting that "resale of tickets is not illegal", it stated that it was banning them in response to community pressure, and it was "absolutely the right thing to do". No similar announcements were made for any other of eBay's web sites, such as &lt;tt&gt;eBay.com&lt;/tt&gt;, and no particular restrictions on the sales of event tickets with respect to ♡❤Live 8♡❤ are included in eBay's resale policy.

&lt;a href="Bob%20Geldof"&gt;Bob Geldof&lt;/a&gt; had labelled the advertising for sale of the tickets "sick profiteering". He described the community reaction as people realising that "the weakest people on our planet" were being exploited, and being "sickened by that". In response to an earlier offer by eBay to hand over to the ♡❤Live 8♡❤ charity its fees from the sales, Geldof had said "It is not acceptable that a giant electronic company that makes billions upon billions then morally says 'we will just hand over our take to a charity'. It is filthy money made on the back of the poorest people on the planet. Stick it where it belongs."

On Tuesday night, the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Weather%20Service"&gt;National Weather Service&lt;/a&gt; issued a tsunami bulletin for the &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20coast"&gt;Pacific coast&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3AMexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; border to &lt;a href="w%3AVancouver%2C%20Canada"&gt;Vancouver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, after a 7.0 &lt;a href="w%3ARichter%20magnitude%20scale"&gt;magnitude&lt;/a&gt; earthquake occurred approximately 80 miles off the coast of Northern California at 19:50 PDT.

The warning has now been cancelled. The quake's motion was horizontal, not vertical (the movement that typically leads to a tsunami).

Witnesses along the California coast reported buildings shaking, but no major damage or injuries were reported.

Details of the earthquakes which have taken place in the past week (including the three major earthquakes which have taken place in, or close to, the Americas over the last 24 hours) can be found at http://earthquake.usgs.gov/

A full text of the now-cancelled tsunami warning follows:

A 4-year-old-boy named Daudi Bamuwamye from &lt;a href="w%3ASellersville%2C%20Pennsylvania"&gt;Sellersville&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Pennsylvania"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, died yesterday after collapsing on the &lt;a href="w%3AMission%3A%20SPACE"&gt;Mission: SPACE&lt;/a&gt; ride in &lt;a href="w%3AEpcot"&gt;Epcot&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AWalt%20Disney%20World%20Resort"&gt;Walt Disney World Resort&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;. His mother carried him off the ride, and after attempts to revive him at the theme park by paramedics, he was declared dead in hospital. The ride was closed after the death yesterday but, after an inspection by company engineers concluded that the ride was operating normally, re-opened. No changes were made to the ride or to the restrictions upon who may ride it.

A Disney official said in a statement that Disney officials were "providing support to the family and are doing everything we can to help them during this difficult time." Disney spokeswoman Jacquee Polak said that "We believe the ride is safe in its current configuration."

Sheri Blanton of the medical examiner's office in &lt;a href="Orlando"&gt;Orlando&lt;/a&gt; said that the &lt;a href="wikt%3Aautopsy"&gt;autopsy&lt;/a&gt; yesterday showed no trauma, that further tests will be done, and that the cause of death may not be known for several weeks. The sheriff's office in Orlando said that the boy met the minimum height requirement (44 inches) for the ride.

The ride features 2 &lt;a href="w%3AGee"&gt;G&lt;/a&gt;s of acceleration. While this is not abnormal for rides, several people had complained of nausea from the ride and airsickness bags had been installed on the ride itself. Houston-based theme park consultant Randy King, a former safety director at &lt;a href="w%3ASix%20Flags"&gt;Six Flags&lt;/a&gt;, said "Two Gs is not that big a deal."

Anonymous &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; sources say that &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APresident"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; will likely give a special news briefing on the subject of Iran. Sources say that the press conference is scheduled to be held within a week and it will be officially announced in short notice. Other details about the rumored conference, such as what exactly will be discussed, are unknown. 

One possibility is that Bush will deviate yet again from the expected theme at an already-scheduled function; on June 14, Bush addressed a &lt;a href="w%3AFuture%20Farmers%20of%20America"&gt;Future Farmers of America&lt;/a&gt; (FFA) group at &lt;a href="w%3APenn%20State"&gt;Penn State&lt;/a&gt;, but spoke mostly about &lt;a href="w%3ASocial%20Security"&gt;Social Security&lt;/a&gt; instead of agricultural issues.

On Friday, June 10, 2005, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20President"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; said that the United States will defend the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20of%20China"&gt;Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; (Taiwan) if it is ever attacked by the &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; (mainland China). The President expressed this position in an interview with Neil Cavuto in Fox News Channel's ♡❤Your World with Neil Cavuto♡❤.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
CAVUTO: Do we still stand by an agreement, Mr. President, that if Taiwan is ever invaded, we will defense Taiwan?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
BUSH: Yes, we do. It's called the Taiwan Relations Act. The policy of the U.S. government is this: We're for a One China policy based upon what they call the Three Communiqués, and that we adhere to the Taiwan Relations Act, which means this: Neither side will unilaterally change the status quo. In other words, neither side will make a decision that steps outside the bounds of that statement I just made to you. If China were to invade unilaterally, we would rise up in the spirit of Taiwan Relations Act. If Taiwan were to declare independence unilaterally, it would be a unilateral decision that would then change the U.S. equation.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"Five marines were killed in action Thursday when their vehicle hit an explosive device while conducting combat operations near Haqlaniyah," the United States Military said in a statement on Friday evening.

The attack itself came hours after reports that up to 17 bodies had been found killed in the same province. Reports say that the bodies were killed "execution style" and were near Anbar.

In Baghdad, up to three Iraqi civilians were killed and several others were wounded in a car bomb blast, that exploded near a busy marketplace in the mainly Shia district of Shula.

<h1>Red and processed meats linked to bowel cancer</h1>

A large-scale study has demonstrated a risk of bowel cancer associated with the consumption of large amount of red or processed meats.

The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study was set up ten years ago to investigate the effects of nutrition on cancer. Funded by the British Medical Research Council, Cancer Research UK, and the International Agency for Research on Cancer, half a million people aged between 25 and 70 across Europe were studied from 1992 to 1998. The results are being published in the latest edition of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.

After an average of five years, people who had eaten more than two portions of red and processed meats a day (160g) were 35% more likely to develop bowel cancer than those who only ate one portion a week.

Eating one or more portions of fish a day (over 80g) was associated with a reduction of 20% in risk compared to people who only ate fish once a week.

Chicken was found to have no effect.

Red meat was defined as beef, lamb, pork and veal while processed meat was mostly pork and beef that were preserved by methods other than freezing. These include ham, bacon, sausages, liver pate, salami, tinned meat, luncheon meat and corned beef.

In the UK, bowel cancer is the second most common cancer for women and third most common for men. In England and Wales, currently about 1 in 18 men and 1 in 20 women will be diagnosed with the disease. Some 50% of bowel cases are cured - rising to 80% if caught early enough.

An autopsy on the body of &lt;a href="Terri%20Schiavo"&gt;Terri Schiavo&lt;/a&gt;, the brain-damaged woman whose right-to-die case had spurred controversy and nation-wide attention, revealed that her brain was half the size of a normal female adult's, suggesting that the woman was in a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Apersistent%20vegetative%20state"&gt;vegetative state&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , just as her husband, Michael, had argued in court and before the press.

Doctors also tell the press that the autopsy revealed that Ms. Schiavo was blind and that her disability was not caused by any sort of abuse.

The Terri Schiavo case, another chapter in court cases over a person's right to die, sparked attention from the international media. The case was caused by a dispute between husband Michael Schiavo and the parents of Terri over whether the disabled Ms. Schiavo, who could not communicate with anyone, desired to die. Courts that examined the case ruled in favor of Michael Schiavo's proposition to remove Ms. Schiavo's feeding tube. The removal of the tube caused the dehydration and eventual death of Ms. Schiavo, doctors say.

The Terri Schiavo Foundation's web site had previously claimed that Terri Schiavo was not in a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Apersistent%20vegetative%20state"&gt;persistent vegetative state&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (PVS) and that she was responsive to human emotion. Those statements have since been taken offline.

The &lt;a href="UK"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; has suspended £30m ($54m) of aid payments to &lt;a href="Ethiopia"&gt;Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt; following the deaths of 36 people in protests over disputed elections.

The UK Development Minister, Hillary Benn, announced the move after talks with Ethiopian Prime Minister &lt;a href="Meles%20Zenawi"&gt;Meles Zenawi&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Addis%20Ababa"&gt;Addis Ababa&lt;/a&gt;.

Benn said that Ethiopia should allow the &lt;a href="Red%20Cross"&gt;Red Cross&lt;/a&gt; access to detainees, and that they either be charged or released.

Ethiopia has said it has started releasing people, but has not provided figures on the number imprisoned. Opposition groups estimate the number to be 3,600.

UK Prime Minister &lt;a href="Tony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; telephoned Zenawi on Sunday to express his concern at the shootings. Ethiopia has stated that it has begun releasing many of those arrested during the protests, however, &lt;a href="Human%20Rights%20Watch"&gt;Human Rights Watch&lt;/a&gt; says those being held are at risk of abuse.

On Tuesday, Ethiopia's leaders signed a declaration to try to end violence and launch an investigation into election complaints.

&lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;'s scandal-plagued Liberal party has survived a series of 15 confidence votes late last night, ensuring Canadians won't be forced to head to the polls in a snap election this summer.

The minority government's win came amidst uncertainty over whether backbench MPs would force an election over the contentious issue of same-sex marriage. 

But Prime Minister &lt;a href="Paul%20Martin"&gt;Paul Martin&lt;/a&gt; has yet another hurdle to jump with a key vote on Thursday over the government's second budget bill. 

The bill is an amendment that came about as a result of a deal reached with the NDP Party in April, when the party's leader, &lt;a href="Jack%20Layton"&gt;Jack Layton&lt;/a&gt;, offered to support the Liberals if they would amend the budget to cancel corporate tax cuts due to be phased in over several years.

The budget deal with the NDP outlines $4.6 billion in spending for infrastructure, education, foreign aid and the environment. 

Martin's government has been plagued by a sponsorship scandal over irregularities in public advertising contracts dating back to the 1990s awarded by the previous administration.

The &lt;a href="U.S.%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; has yet to vote on the matter.

The House's vote comes with the "sunset" provision set by Congress that will cause 15 parts of the Patriot Act, a controversial anti-terror bill championed by the Bush administration, to expire at the end of 2005.

The "&lt;a href="w%3ADowning%20Street%20memo"&gt;Downing Street memo&lt;/a&gt;" is the subject of a forum at the Washington Capitol complex today headed by &lt;a href="w%3ACongressman"&gt;Congressman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Conyers"&gt;John Conyers&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20House%20Committee%20on%20the%20Judiciary"&gt;Judiciary Committee&lt;/a&gt; and televised on &lt;a href="w%3AC-SPAN"&gt;C-SPAN&lt;/a&gt; 3. Conyers said that "there was a secret decision well ahead of the authority Congress had given" and that as the Bush administration "was assuring Congress, they were secretly planning war."

The Downing Street Memo is the leaked minutes of a July, 2002 meeting in British prime minister Tony Blair's office which occurred eight months before the war in Iraq. The minutes say that "Bush wanted to remove Saddam through military action, justified by the conjunction of terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy."

Gold Star Families for Peace is a group of families of Americans who were killed in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. They also have been focusing on the British document and asking members of Congress to press for answers. The organization's leader, Cindy Sheehan, said the forum is "calling on Congress to do the right thing, to investigate the memo. I would hope that we would get an investigation going into the lies that lead our country into war and hold somebody accountable for those lies."

Schneider said the minutes imply that "The Bush administration had already decided to go to war before asking for a vote of Congress, before going to the United Nations. The question the memo raises is, did the United States and Britain go to the United Nations to avoid going to war or to justify going to war?"

At their June 7 press conference, President Bush and Prime Minister Blair were asked about the issues raised by the memo:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;TONY BLAIR&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom"&gt;PRIME MINISTER OF BRITAIN&lt;/a&gt;: But the facts were not being fixed in any shape or form at all.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;GEORGE W. BUSH&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES&lt;/a&gt;: Somebody said, well, you know, we had made up our mind to go -- to use military force to deal with Saddam. There's nothing farther from the truth.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<h1>Bomb blast in Iran injures three civilians</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Bomb%20blast%20in%20Iran%20injures%20three%20civilians&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

For a second time this week, the southeastern Iranian city of &lt;a href="w%3AZahedan"&gt;Zahedan&lt;/a&gt; was rocked by a bombing. Like the previous bomb blast reported Tuesday, it was relatively small and produced only three injuries and no fatalities. This is in stark contrast to bombs detonated over the weekend in &lt;a href="w%3AAhwaz"&gt;Ahwaz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATehran"&gt;Tehran&lt;/a&gt;, which produced a dozen fatalities and scores of injuries.
The Ahwaz bomb went off in a fast-food restaurant at 7:50 PM local time.

A government spokesperson said both bombings were "...anti-[Islamic] &lt;a href="w%3AIslamic%20revolution"&gt;revolution&lt;/a&gt; elements against innocent people."

Across the border, &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraqi&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AIbrahim%20al-Jafari"&gt;Ibrahim al-Jafari&lt;/a&gt; issued a denunciation of the bombings and called for closer anti-terrorism cooperation between the countries of the &lt;a href="w%3AMiddle%20East"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt;.

It is not clear who has truly been behind the string of Zahedan and Tehran bombings. Three little-known Arab separatist groups operating in the rebellious &lt;a href="w%3AKhuzestan"&gt;Khuzestan&lt;/a&gt; province have claimed credit for the bombings there, but no one has stepped forward to claim the others. 

At first, after the earliest attacks, the government seemed to blame the &lt;a href="w%3AMojahedin-e-Khalq"&gt;Mojahedin-e-Khalq&lt;/a&gt; (MeK) organization. It later expanded its accusations to allege U.S. facilitation and imply infiltration via U.S. occupied Iraq or &lt;a href="w%3AAfghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, both of which share extensive borders with Iran. The MeK, which formerly operated under Saddam Hussein's protection in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, has claimed bombings in the past, but vehemently denies participating in the recent spate of attacks. The group seems to have moved away from violent acts in recent years as it tries to curry favor with Western governments and shed its terrorist image (the group is currently listed on U.S. and many European terrorist watch lists). The affiliated &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Council%20of%20Resistance%20of%20Iran"&gt;National Council of Resistance of Iran&lt;/a&gt; (NCRI) has also denied involvement. 

On March 30, a previously unknown group called "The 70 Million People of Iran" issued a statement hinting at violent resistance to the current regime --- but only ♡❤after♡❤ a June 18 deadline, which has not yet passed.

Reformist candidate &lt;a href="w%3AMostafa%20Moin"&gt;Mostafa Moin&lt;/a&gt; has raised the possibility that rouge hardline Islamist groups planted the bombs to frighten people into choosing a military-affiliated candidate. Moin, currently running number two in the polls behind former president and current &lt;a href="w%3AExpediency%20Discernment%20Council"&gt;Discernment Council&lt;/a&gt; chairman &lt;a href="w%3AAkbar%20Hashemi%20Rasfanjani"&gt;Akbar Hashemi Rasfanjani&lt;/a&gt;, also threatened to pull out of the race and ask his supporters to boycott elections to protest the treatment of his running mates and supporters, several of whom have been attacked by extremist mobs.

<h1>Canadian boy killed in Cambodian seige; Police storm school</h1>

Gunmen stormed a Cambodian school today taking kindergardeners and teachers &lt;a href="w%3Ahostage"&gt;hostage&lt;/a&gt;.

The men entered Siem Reap International School, a &lt;a href="w%3ACambodia"&gt;Cambodian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aelementary%20school"&gt;elementary school&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASiem%20Reap"&gt;Siem Reap&lt;/a&gt; (near &lt;a href="w%3AAngkor%20Wat"&gt;Angkor Wat&lt;/a&gt;), earlier today.

The gunmen killed one Canadian boy of an unknown age, apparently after he would not stop crying. Police began negotiating with the hostage takers after the killing. 

Cambodian police raided the school after the hostages had been held for six hours. Two gunmen, along with the Canadian child, have reportedly died, while the police have detained four more suspects. The surviving hostages have now been freed. 

"All of a sudden the gates opened and people came running out with children in their arms," said John McDermott, a correspondent for &lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;.

Most of the children that were held hostage are the sons and daughters of hotel workers. According to a resident, the hostages were &lt;a href="w%3ASingaporean"&gt;Singaporean&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AKorean"&gt;Korean&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJapanese"&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwanese"&gt;Taiwanese&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIrish"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABritish"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASwiss"&gt;Swiss&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesian"&gt;Indonesian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIndian"&gt;Indian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AItalian"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AFilipino"&gt;Filipino&lt;/a&gt;. 

She added, "The gunmen let one class go, but they [were] holding the kindergarten class."

The Siem Reap International School has served as a support system for the rapidly increasing number of expatriate workers attracted by Cambodia's tourist industry upsurge, one of the very few boosters of the severely impoverished nation's &lt;a href="w%3AEconomy%20of%20Cambodia"&gt;economy&lt;/a&gt;.

Speaking on genocide, he said: "people say 'never again' too easily, It's happening today in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . We all share responsibility to actually do things. The conditions of preventing genocide lie partly in helping people to have a better life. It's easier to incite people that have nothing to lose."

Asked why the international community ignored &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARwandan%20Genocide"&gt;past genocide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Wolfowitz said: "There are many explanations but no excuses. We have to work with countries that are working to prevent conflict."

He said he would work together with African countries to cut poverty, citing &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's phrase of a 'deal for a deal': "So many governments here are stepping up to take responsibility.". He added that World Bank assistance to service debt repayments could now go towards meeting needs, following the cancellations of the debts of the 18 poorest countries agreed by &lt;a href="G8"&gt;G8&lt;/a&gt; countries last week.

The forum organised by Never Again, which began at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKigali%20Institute%20of%20Science%20and%20Technology"&gt;Kigali Institute for Science and Technology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; today, has participants from Rwanda, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACongo"&gt;Congo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABurundi"&gt;Burundi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;.

The forum continues today and includes discussions on the future of the Great Lakes region and the international community's responsibility to protect against genocide.

Ryan Park, a 22 year old door-to-door meat salesman from &lt;a href="w%3AWaterboro%2C%20Maine"&gt;Waterboro, Maine&lt;/a&gt; was arrested yesterday, and charged with assaulting a woman in &lt;a href="w%3AStoddard%2C%20New%20Hampshire"&gt;Stoddard, New Hampshire&lt;/a&gt; last month. He is charged with forcibly kissing her after she turned down an offer from him of chicken for sex.

Stoddard Police Lieutenant Roger Turcotte stated that the woman, whom he did not name, told police that Park:
<ul>
BULLET::::- persuaded her to let him into her house;
BULLET::::- brought in several boxes of meat and attempted to sell them to her;
BULLET::::- said, when told that she did not have the money to spend, "Well that’s all right. I’ll take anything in trade: knives, drug paraphernalia, guns, anything else that you have to offer";
BULLET::::- tried to sell her a box of chicken;
BULLET::::- suggested oral sex;
BULLET::::- put his hands on her hips and tried to kiss her;
BULLET::::- asked to be shown the rest of the house, including the bedroom; and
BULLET::::- said "Why don’t you get rid of the kids for a few minutes? This won’t take long. Nobody will know."

</ul>
Turcotte said that in order to get rid of Park the woman gave him a post-dated cheque (which police later helped the woman to stop payment on) and $40, all of the cash that she had, and that when the woman's husband later returned home, Park tried to sell meat to him. Turcotte also said that Park, when questioned by police was "appropriate and polite", and stated to police that "I hit on a lot of women when I go door-to-door.".

Michael Phillips, owner of Pacific Prime Gourmet Foods, a company for which Park is a contractor and that supplies meat and other products and leases vehicles to door-to-door salesmen, stated that he has never had any complaints about Park, adding that if Park is convicted, the company "would have no choice" but to sever its business relationship with him, but that right now "He hasn’t been found guilty of anything. We will support him until we hear otherwise."

Linda Park, Mr. Park's mother, said in regards to the incident, "That’s not something that I would think that he would do.” She also stated that her son would not have to force himself on someone because "he’s very popular with the women."

Park is scheduled to appear in Keene District Court on June 28, 2005.

He said that he will defend the government against those "who want to interrupt the democratic process and want to destabilize the government of president Lula". He said that he is leaving with "clean hands", "a heart without bitterness" and with "a raised head".

Dirceu is the victim of a serious political crisis in Brazil because of accusations of governmental corruption. Dirceu was one of the most important ministers in President Lula's government.

The crisis worsened after declarations of &lt;a href="w%3ARoberto%20Jefferson"&gt;Roberto Jefferson&lt;/a&gt;, president of the PTB, a party allied with the PT.
This Tuesday, Jefferson said to a Congressional Commission that minister José Dirceu and the President of the &lt;a href="w%3AWorkers%27%20Party%20%28Brazil%29"&gt;Workers' Party&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9%20Geno%C3%ADno"&gt;José Genoíno&lt;/a&gt;, were involved in the payment of bribes to Brazilian congressional representatives.

A sizable earthquake shook &lt;a href="w%3ASouthern%20California"&gt;Southern California&lt;/a&gt; for the third time this week. The quake occurred at 1:53 p.m. Pacific Time on Thursday and reached most parts of Southern California by 1:54 p.m. The &lt;a href="w%3ARichter%20magnitude%20scale"&gt;4.9&lt;/a&gt;-scale tremor, appearing to have originated &lt;a href="http%3A//maps.google.com/maps%3Fq%3D34.058%C2%B0N%2C%2B117.011%C2%B0W%26amp%3Bspn%3D0.020111%2C0.030967%26amp%3Bhl%3Den"&gt;79 miles east&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, comes on the tail of two other quakes, including a 7.2 magnitude quake off the coast of Northern California which briefly &lt;a href="Tsunami%20bulletin%20issued%20from%20Pacific%20coast%20of%20California-Mexico%20border%20to%20Vancouver%2C%20Canada"&gt;triggered tsunami warnings&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday night.

Geologists at the &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%20Institute%20of%20Technology"&gt;California Institute of Technology&lt;/a&gt; (Caltech) affirmed that the quake was too weak to cause structural damage to buildings. In &lt;a href="w%3AOrange%20County%2C%20California"&gt;Orange County&lt;/a&gt;, the quake lasted 5 seconds and rattled objects on shelves.

Geologists expressed concern at the occurrence of three earthquakes so close together in time and space. Other Pacific earthquakes, including one in the Aleutian Islands and &lt;a href="Earthquake%20hits%20Chile"&gt;another in Chile&lt;/a&gt;, have also occurred in recent days.

Canada's communications regulator, the , has approved three applications for subscription-based services. The three applicants are Canadian Satellite Radio Inc, , and .

Two of the applicants, Canadian Satellite Radio and SIRIUS Canada are both required to offer at least eight original channels (10% of all channels) produced in Canada. Also, 85% of the music and spoken programming broadcast on the "Canadian channels" have to be Canadian, and 25% of the Canadian channels must be broadcast in French.

The lobby group, publicly opposes this decision, saying that it creates a pipeline for U.S. radio programs into Canada.

&lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush&lt;/a&gt; appointee Robert McCallum overrode Justice Department lawyers who had been handling the government's tobacco racketeering trial for the past 5 years. McCallum ordered the lawyers to reduce the penalties sought at the close of the nine-month trial from $130 billion to $10 billion, angering some of the trial lawyers to the point where it is reported they threatened to quit their jobs.

"Everyone is asking, 'Why now?' " said an anonymous Justice Department employee afraid of retaliation. "Why would you throw the case down the toilet at the very last hour, after five years?"

Congressional Democrats oppose the slashing of the penalties for the tobacco industry, and have asked &lt;a href="w%3AAttorney%20General"&gt;Attorney General&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Alberto%20Gonzales"&gt;Alberto Gonzales&lt;/a&gt; not to enter into a settlement based on "the unreasonably weak demands made by the government."

The New York Times pointed out that McCallum was a &lt;a href="w%3A%20Skull%20and%20Bones"&gt;Skull and Bones&lt;/a&gt; 'brother' of President Bush. Bush has appointed a number of Skull and Bones club members to government positions since he became President, including SEC head and former Philip Morris executive William Donaldson. Bush strategist &lt;a href="Karl%20Rove"&gt;Karl Rove&lt;/a&gt; was a Phillip Morris lobbyist before Bush asked him to work on his 2000 campaign for the presidency.

Five prisoners were beheaded and got their heads exhibited by the rioters during a violent riot in the "Zwinglio Ferreira" Prison, located in &lt;a href="w%3APresidente%20Venceslau"&gt;Presidente Venceslau&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AS%C3%A3o%20Paulo%20State"&gt;São Paulo State&lt;/a&gt;, Brazil.

This is the most serious riot of prisoners in the 19 year existence of the penitentiary. The rebellion began Tuesday, at 8:30 a.m. and it finished Wednesday at 2:30 p.m. Some heads belonging to the murdered prisoners were put on iron spears so they could be shown from the roof of the prison. Some prisoners played football with one of the heads. 

According to Nagashi Furukawa, the secretary of the administration of the prison, the rebellion originated because of prisoners who were contrary to the criminal organization ♡❤Primeiro Comando da Capital♡❤ (PCC). The supporters of PCC killed their opponents.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABalance%20of%20trade"&gt;trade deficit&lt;/a&gt; increased to its highest level yet: $195.1 billion (£161 billion) in the first quarter of &lt;a href="w%3A2005"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt;, according to preliminary &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Commerce"&gt;U.S. Commerce Department&lt;/a&gt; figures. The figure represents the sum of money flowing into the United States by selling exports subtracted from the amount of money leaving the United States from import purchases. The last quarter of 2004 saw a deficit of $188.4 billion.

The new record-breaking deficit represents 6.4 percent of the US's &lt;a href="w%3AMeasures%20of%20national%20income%20and%20output"&gt;gross national product&lt;/a&gt;, again an increase on last-quarter &lt;a href="w%3A2004"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt; - up 0.1 percent. The deficit on goods increased from $182.2 billion to $186.3 billion, as imports of goods increased more than exports, particularly in industrial supplies and materials, capital goods, and consumer products. It is believed that &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;'s economic boom, and the increase in imports from the country, is partly responsible.

Analysts expressed concern at the findings, with Allan Seychuk, an economist at RBC Capital Markets, saying "This is not the direction markets were hoping to see for the mammoth current account deficit. The U.S. dollar has lost a great deal of ground because markets are uncomfortable with a deficit that has now reached record levels."

In a statement today, Senior Investigating Officer Detective Superintendent Mike Veale named Hugo Quintas aged 23 of Seymour Court, &lt;a href="w%3ATrowbridge"&gt;Trowbridge&lt;/a&gt;, former boyfriend of Hayley Richards, as being wanted for her murder; and stated that a European warrant had been issued for his arrest. Richards, aged 23 and pregnant at the time of her murder, was found in her flat in Carders Corner, Trowbridge on the afternoon of Saturday June 11, 2005, with her throat slit. DS Veale stated that it was known that Quintas boarded a plane from Bristol Airport on Saturday afternoon, bound for &lt;a href="Portugal"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt;, but that his present whereabouts are unknown.

DS Veale stated that Joaquim Sergio Da-Cunha, aged 29 who shared a house with Quintas, was arrested two days ago, and today appeared in court charged with perverting the course of justice, where he had been remanded in custody until June 24, 2005, when he will appear at Swindon Crown Court.
DS Veale also released a photograph of Quintas for publication and broadcast, and appealed for help from the public in connection with a car, an L-registered black Rover 200 SLI, which is now in the possession of the Wiltshire constabulary. He stated that he knew that it was in the Trowbridge area in the days leading up to the murder, and needed to know where it was during the period from the evening of Friday June 10, 2005, to the following afternoon.

DS Veale urged anyone who can help in connection with this particular line of enquiry to contact Wiltshire Police on +44 1380 735735 or (within the United Kingdom only) call Crimestoppers anonymously on +44 800 555 111.

Drivers on &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt;'s M3 motorway were stunned to be confronted with a shower of cash on Tuesday evening.

Eleven thousand &lt;a href="w%3APound%20sterling"&gt;pounds&lt;/a&gt;' worth of £20 notes were blown from the rucksack of a passenger on a motorcycle at 7:30pm, while the motorway was busy with traffic.

Just £500 was recovered; the rest is believed to have been blown away in the windy evening. At least four other drivers quickly stopped, causing Hampshire police concern for safety.

The police are now investigating as to why the pair were carrying so much money. Carrying large amounts of money is not illegal, but is highly unusual. The riders said they had been to a car auction, returning empty-handed.

The motorcyclists re-started their journey, but the cycle broke down just two junctions on.

A &lt;a href="w%3AGoodyear%20Tire%20and%20Rubber%20Company"&gt;Goodyear&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABlimp"&gt;blimp&lt;/a&gt; crashed at a &lt;a href="w%3ACoral%20Springs%2C%20FL"&gt;Coral Springs, Florida&lt;/a&gt; industrial park on Thursday night, causing about 1,400 homes to lose power. The two people on board, pilot Daniel Lynn Thomas and passenger Charles Thomas, were not hurt, although they were trapped on board briefly while electrical crews cleared the area.

The blimp, named the "Stars and Stripes" is 192 feet long, 59.5 feet tall, and 50 feet wide. It took off from Goodyear's 32 acre blimp base at Pompano Beach Air Park, about 12 miles away, shortly before the crash. It is one of three Goodyear Blimps in the United States.

The &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Aviation%20Administration"&gt;Federal Aviation Administration&lt;/a&gt; is investigating the cause of the crash, thought to be weather related. Goodyear company spokesman Jerry Jenkins, in a brief statement on Thursday, said, "We're grateful there were no injuries onboard or on the ground. Following an investigation, more information will be released."

"Stars and Stripes" was the oldest of the three operational Goodyear blimps and was best known for providing aerial coverage of NASCAR races.

MasterCard International announced Friday that multiple instances of fraud have been tracked back to CardSystems Solutions, Inc., a company that processes credit card transactions and other payments. Customer names, banks, and account numbers of up to 40 million cardholders have been exposed, of which about 13.9 million are MasterCard-branded cards, the company said. Visa and American Express cards were also affected.

"The breach appears to be the largest yet involving financial data," said David Sobel, of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. 

CardSystems issued a statement late on Friday that said it learned of the potential breach 26 days ago, but that the FBI told the company not to advise the cardholders nor the public at large. CardSystems also said their statement had been vetted by the FBI.

A spokesperson for the FBI said that the agency had asked CardSystems not to disclose information that could compromise the investigation, but that it had not asked CardSystems to fail to disclose the breach at all. 

Michael A. Brady, C.F.O. of CardSystems, told the Associated Press that "we're absolutely blindsided by a press release by the association," when speaking of MasterCard's release. A MasterCard spokesperson said that the company was obligated to inform its customers of the breach.

MasterCard spokesperson Sharon Gamsin said that CardSystems was hit by a virus-like computer script that stole customer data for the purpose of fraud. She said MasterCard does not know how the script got into the CardSystem network.

Sobel said this theft "indicates that this is a shadowy industry where the consumer never really knows who is going to be handling and using their personal information. Presumably, the affected consumers thought they were dealing with MasterCard." Having a third-party process credit card transactions is common practice in the industry.

The former &lt;a href="w%3ACEO"&gt;CEO&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ATyco%20International"&gt;Tyco International&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADennis%20Kozlowski"&gt;Dennis Kozlowski&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="w%3ACFO"&gt;CFO&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Swartz"&gt;Mark Swartz&lt;/a&gt; are convicted of taking more than $600 million from the company. Charges include &lt;a href="w%3ALarceny"&gt;grand larceny&lt;/a&gt;, securities &lt;a href="w%3Afraud"&gt;fraud&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Aconspiracy"&gt;conspiracy&lt;/a&gt;, and falsifying business records.

The first trial ended in a &lt;a href="w%3Amistrial"&gt;mistrial&lt;/a&gt; after one juror received a threatening letter. Nancy Salomon says of the second trial that the "Defense was counting on the jury not reaching a verdict; they had used their challenges during the jury selection process to kick almost every potential juror who had a college degree, or had any business experience or &lt;a href="w%3AWall%20Street"&gt;Wall Street&lt;/a&gt; experience off the jury ... they were hoping that this case was just going to be too confusing for the jury." While the jury did take 11 days to arrive at their decision, they found Kozlowski and Swartz guilty on 22 of the 23 counts. To combat the aggressive jury selection strategy undertaken by the defense, the prosecution "basically gave the jury several credit hours worth of an &lt;a href="w%3AMBA"&gt;MBA&lt;/a&gt;", teaching them about following &lt;a href="w%3APaper%20trail"&gt;paper trails&lt;/a&gt; and detecting falsification of business records. It paid off during deliberation as the jury requested over 100 documents to review.

Kozlowski and Swartz directly stole approximately $150 million USD from Tyco and acquired $430 million more by inflating the company's stock value and then secretly selling company shares. &lt;a href="w%3ABail"&gt;Bail&lt;/a&gt; was set at $10 million each. The two former executives face a minimum of eight years in prison, up to a maximum of 25 years. In addition, Kozlowski is accused of evading $1 million in sales taxes on six paintings that he bought in 2001 in a separate New York State case, and Swartz faces &lt;a href="w%3ATax%20evasion"&gt;tax evasion&lt;/a&gt; charges in New Hampshire. If convicted in these cases as well, they would face up to 30 years in prison.

The government of &lt;a href="Sudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt; signed a landmark agreement on Saturday with the opposition group &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Democratic%20Alliance%20%28Sudan%29"&gt;National Democratic Alliance&lt;/a&gt; (NDA). Some issues are yet to be agreed upon, but the deal signals progress in resolving decades of civil war in Sudan. 

Sudan, the largest country in &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;, has been rocked by two separate periods of bloody civil war, from 1955 to 1972, and from 1983 to this year. More than 2 million refugees have fled the violence. On January 9, a peace deal was signed between the northern government and southern rebels, paving the way for Saturday's conference.

The conference, located in &lt;a href="Cairo"&gt;Cairo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Egypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;, was attended by both Egyptian President &lt;a href="Hosni%20Mubarak"&gt;Hosni Mubarak&lt;/a&gt; and Sudanese President &lt;a href="w%3AOmar%20Hasan%20Ahmad%20al-Bashir"&gt;Omar Hassan Ahmad al-Bashir&lt;/a&gt;. The treaty was signed by Sudanese Vice President &lt;a href="w%3AAli%20Osman%20Taha"&gt;Ali Osman Taha&lt;/a&gt; and NDA leader Mohammed Osman al-Mirghani. The NDA was formed from 13 political parties in 1989 to oppose Bashir's new regime after he seized power in a military coup.

Many in the international community hope that chances are improving for a settlement in the conflict-torn region of Darfur with the main rebel faction, the &lt;a href="w%3ASudan%20Liberation%20Army"&gt;Sudan Liberation Army&lt;/a&gt;. Groundwork is being laid for elections to take place in three years.

The Associated Press has put typed copies of six recently obtained internal British government documents concerning the lead-up to the war in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; on its website which are labeled "secret" or "confidential". The copies were provided by British reporter Michael Smith, who claims he destroyed the original documents to protect the sources. An anonymous senior British official said the documents appeared authentic.

The documents were leaked on 18 September 2004 to &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Daily%20Telegraph"&gt;The Daily Telegraph&lt;/a&gt; in an article titled "&lt;a href="http%3A//www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml%3Fxml%3D/news/2004/09/18/nwar18.xml%26amp%3BsSheet%3D/portal/2004/09/18/ixportaltop.html"&gt;Secret papers show Blair was warned of Iraq chaos&lt;/a&gt;". The documents, however, took 9 months to reach the mainstream press.

AP is saying that the memos show; "When Prime Minister &lt;a href="Tony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt;'s chief foreign policy adviser dined with &lt;a href="Condoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; six months after Sept. 11, the then-U.S. national security adviser didn't want to discuss Osama bin Laden or al-Qaida. She wanted to talk about 'regime change' in Iraq, setting the stage for the U.S.-led invasion more than a year later."

"U.S. scrambling to establish a link between Iraq and al-Qaida is so far frankly unconvincing," British Foreign Office political director Peter Ricketts said in one of the memos. "For Iraq, `regime change' does not stack up. It sounds like a grudge between Bush and Saddam." Ricketts said.

Another memo addressed to Foreign Secretary Jack Straw says,"But even the best survey of Iraq's WMD programs will not show much advance in recent years on the nuclear, missile or CW/BW (chemical or biological weapons) fronts: the programs are extremely worrying but have not, as far as we know, been stepped up."

The memos express concern about breaking international law but Blair is shown as being determined to go to war as America's ally regardless.

An Iraq expert at the University of London, Tony Dodge said, "The documents show what official inquiries in Britain already have, that the case of weapons of mass destruction was based on thin intelligence and was used to inflate the evidence to the level of mendacity. In going to war with Bush, Blair defended the special relationship between the two countries, like other British leaders have. But he knew he was taking a huge political risk at home. He knew the war's legality was questionable and its unpopularity was never in doubt." Dodge also said the memos show that Blair was aware that postwar instability was likely for Iraq.

In one of the memos, David Manning, who was Blair's chief foreign policy adviser, reported on a meeting in Washington with Rice: "It is clear that Bush is grateful for your (Blair's) support and has registered that you are getting flak. I said that you would not budge in your support for regime change but you had to manage a press, a Parliament and a public opinion that was very different than anything in the States. And you would not budge either in your insistence that, if we pursued regime change, it must be very carefully done and produce the right result. Failure was not an option."

A March 22 memo from Ricketts to Foreign Secretary Straw said, "We have to be convincing that: the threat is so serious/imminent that it is worth sending our troops to die for; it is qualitatively different from the threat posed by other proliferators who are closer to achieving nuclear capability (including Iran)."

Rebels from the &lt;a href="w%3AHutu"&gt;Hutu&lt;/a&gt;-extremist "&lt;a href="w%3AForces%20Nationales%20de%20Liberation"&gt;Forces Nationales de Liberation&lt;/a&gt;" have shot dead six churchgoers in Muhuta district, &lt;a href="w%3ABujumbura-Rural"&gt;Bujumbura-Rural&lt;/a&gt;, according to army spokesman Adolphe Manirakiza.

"The first criminal attack was committed in one church at Muhuta district where a group of &lt;a href="w%3AFNL"&gt;FNL&lt;/a&gt; fighters fired in the church and killed six people including a pastor. They also injured seven others", Manirakiza said.

He said the rebels shot dead a local government official and his brother and also kidnapped a policeman in the same district.

"We don't know yet why these people were killed, they may be executed because they refused to adhere to the FNL ideology, as the area where they have been killed is an FNL stronghold."

Some 300,000 people have been killed since the fighting began in 1993. 

Fresh talks between the government and the &lt;a href="w%3AFNL"&gt;FNL&lt;/a&gt; have raised hopes among diplomats that &lt;a href="w%3ABurundi"&gt;Burundi&lt;/a&gt; can finally lift one of its last big barriers to peace. 

Its leader Agathon Rwasa and Burundi President, &lt;a href="w%3ADomitien%20Ndayizeye"&gt;Domitien Ndayizeye&lt;/a&gt; signed on May 15 in &lt;a href="w%3ADar%20es%20Salaam"&gt;Dar es Salaam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATanzania"&gt;Tanzania&lt;/a&gt;, a cessation of hostilities deal seen as a significant step toward finally bringing the rebels into the peace process. 

But the rebels and the army have clashed sporadically since the truce.

The Never Again youth forum on genocide prevention ended in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKigali"&gt;Kigali&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Rwanda"&gt;Rwanda&lt;/a&gt; with young people from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGreat%20Lakes%20%28Africa%29"&gt;Great Lakes region&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and other countries making a string of recommendations for the prevention of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Agenocide"&gt;genocide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Following the visit by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Bank"&gt;World Bank&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; President &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Wolfowitz"&gt;Paul Wolfowitz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , during which he promised to give the Never Again network his "moral support" and asked members about their views on what African youth needed, the network will send its ideas to the consultation for civil society on the &lt;a href="U.N."&gt;U.N.&lt;/a&gt; High Level Panel to be discussed in September, which includes bringing in a new principle of Responsibility to Protect into the international framework of sovereignty.

Conference participants called for more local input in international protection work as well as for the international community to listen more to voices on the ground. They accused the international community of failing in their duty by not giving U.N. missions more power on the ground and using the "excuse" that they did not know local languages and therefore did not respond to incitement to violence towards Tutsis broadcast on national radio in the lead-up to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARwandan%20Genocode"&gt;genocide in Rwanda in 1994&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Many participants criticised the uneven responses given by the international community to different regions. A participant from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACongo"&gt;Congo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; called for help to be given to "all citizens in the world, without distinction". Another said: "If our poverty [in Africa] is the cause of our being ignored then I fear for the future. Where there is interest there is energy and I fear we will lose the energy."

The final day also featured intense dialogue on regional conflict in the Great Lakes region and showed the different perspectives on the Burundi/Rwanda refugee story (link). Discussion groups looked at ways in which the youth could create better international networks and improve critical thinking and communication amongst the youth.

A media group took part in the conference and reported it for &lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt; this week. They will now produce a publication which will be translated into &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKinyarwanda%20language"&gt;Kinyarwandan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and distributed vocally as well as on paper as a way of involving young Rwandese from rural areas who have very high levels of poverty and illiteracy.

At Sleepy Hollow Elementary School in the Falls Church section of Fairfax County, he spoke to elementary school students who had learned about his accomplishments in the weeks prior to his appearance. 

"I thought I was doing the right thing," Rusesabagina said. "You also should do the right thing." He explained the situation he faced in simple terms. "There were bad people and good people. The good people came to hide in my &lt;a href="w%3AHotel_des_Mille_Collines"&gt;hotel&lt;/a&gt;, I had to give them food. I had to give them shelter and keep away the bad people for two and a half months." When asked if he was scared, he responded "No, fortunately I did not have time to be scared. I did not know that what I was doing was different. I thought other people were doing it."

In Atlanta, speaking with business leaders, he focused on the present and future. 

"What is going on in &lt;a href="w%3ADarfur"&gt;Darfur&lt;/a&gt; is exactly what had been going on in &lt;a href="w%3ARwanda"&gt;Rwanda&lt;/a&gt;, the government is killing its own citizens." He encouraged business leaders to bring money into Africa but made it clear that Africa was in need of more than just business interest. "What Africans need as a whole is not only someone who will come and pay their education, but it is also to change the systems in Africa. To help us to change, to find lasting solutions. Africa is ruled by dictators. And those dictators should know that one day they also can be brought to justice," emphasizing the idea that Africa needed a political revamping to stabilize.

<h1>Los Angeles Times launches editorial wiki</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Los%20Angeles%20Times%20launches%20editorial%20wiki&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20Times"&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/a&gt; has launched a web site where readers can collaboratively edit and respond to certain editorials from the paper. The site, called &lt;a href="w%3Awikitorial"&gt;Wikitorial&lt;/a&gt;, uses a type of software known as a &lt;a href="w%3Awiki"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;. Registered users over 13 years of age may edit and contribute to designated "Wikitorials". On Friday, the Times posted the site's first editorial on latimes.com, entitled "War and Consequences". The corresponding Wikitorial is named "Dreams About War and Retribution".

In its introduction to Wikitorial, a Los Angeles Times editor invited readers to "rewrite the editorial yourself" if they thought something could be improved. The unsigned introduction to Wikitorial drew parallels with &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, which was said to work "bewilderingly well". The Times hopes that its self-admitted experiment will help a wider range of people express their opinions on editorial topics. The newspaper has acknowledged that the idea may not work, saying "Plenty of skeptics are predicting embarrassment; like an arthritic old lady who takes to the dance floor, they say, the Los Angeles Times is more likely to break a hip than to be hip."

"War and Consequences", a traditional editorial, serves as a starting point for wiki users. The opinion piece calls for clearer goals in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;' current military &lt;a href="w%3APost-invasion%20Iraq%2C%202003-2005"&gt;involvement in Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. The author proposes a clear timetable for training Iraqi troops and police officers, and states that people need to be held responsible for intelligence failures leading up to the war, and failures to provide sufficient troops during and after the war.

The corresponding wikitorial, named "Dreams About War and Retribution", initially started as an exact copy of "War and Consequences" when it was posted on June 17. Since then it has been edited over 150 times. The original editorial confined itself to points supporting two basic claims: The need for a timetable, and the need for responsibility. In contrast, the wikitorial has increased the original scope considerably, weighing in on topics such as the &lt;a href="w%3ADowning%20Street%20memo"&gt;Downing Street memo&lt;/a&gt; and drawing analogies to the &lt;a href="w%3APhilippine-American%20War"&gt;Philippine-American War&lt;/a&gt;. One contributor even accused the American media, including the L.A. Times itself, of dereliction due to their uncritical coverage of the U.S. administration shortly before the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

As of mid day today, June 19th, the &lt;a href="http%3A//www2.latimesinteractive.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page"&gt;LATWiki Main Page&lt;/a&gt; has been replaced with the text "Where is the wikitorial? Unfortunately, we have had to remove this feature, at least temporarily, because a few readers were flooding the site with inappropriate material. Thanks and apologies to the thousands of people who logged on in the right spirit. " There is &lt;a href="http%3A//www.corante.com/importance/archives/2005/06/19/la_times_wikitorial_has_left_the_building_for_now.php"&gt;speculation&lt;/a&gt; that this could be due to the &lt;a href="w%3ASlashdot%20effect"&gt;Slashdot effect&lt;/a&gt; as it was recently &lt;a href="http%3A//slashdot.org/article.pl%3Fsid%3D05/06/18/2143212"&gt;Posted on Slashdot&lt;/a&gt; and that the LA Times was not prepared for the &lt;a href="http%3A//blogging.la/archives/2005/06/wikitorials_are_1.phtml"&gt;editing wars&lt;/a&gt; which quickly ensued.

<h1>Michelin's tyre mistake sends US Formula One Grand Prix into farce</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Michelin%27s%20tyre%20mistake%20sends%20US%20Formula%20One%20Grand%20Prix%20into%20farce&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3A2005%20United%20States%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;Indianapolis Formula One Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt; descended into farce when just six cars started the race on Sunday. The problem arose when &lt;a href="w%3AMichelin"&gt;Michelin&lt;/a&gt; discovered that its tires were incapable of more than ten laps at race pace.

The first indication of trouble was when the rear left tire of &lt;a href="w%3ARalf%20Schumacher"&gt;Ralf Schumacher's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AToyota%20F1"&gt;Toyota&lt;/a&gt; racecar exploded during practice on Friday. Schumacher's car collided with the track wall while travelling at 300 km/h (approx. 186 miles/h), leaving him shaken but generally unharmed. However, further investigations by Michelin revealed that another ten tires had suffered problems, with one also failing on track.

All the problems occurred on the rear left tire during the two long 90 degree corners leading onto the main straight. The nine degree banking and grooves cut into the surface of the track compounded problems.

It is believed that Michelin may not have properly accounted for the grooves cut into the &lt;a href="w%3AIndianapolis%20Motor%20Speedway"&gt;Indianapolis track&lt;/a&gt; to improve grip for Indy cars after the track was resurfaced. Indy cars have smaller down-force generating wings so need more grip from their tires than Formula One cars.

&lt;a href="w%3ABridgestone"&gt;Bridgestone&lt;/a&gt;, the other tire manufacturer currently in Formula One, did not have similar problems. It is possible that their US subsidiary, &lt;a href="w%3AFirestone"&gt;Firestone&lt;/a&gt;, who supplied tires for an Indy car race after the resurfacing, may have sent information back to their Formula One tires department in Japan. The three teams running Bridgestone tires - Ferrari, Jordan and Minardi - were therefore able to compete without any safety concerns.

Under FIA racing regulations, the only course of action was for the Michelin runners to withdraw from the race on safety grounds. Rules prevented alternative tires from being flown from France overnight, although Michelin were unsure whether these tires were also affected by the problem.

Drivers and teams had also suggested building a &lt;a href="w%3Achicane"&gt;chicane&lt;/a&gt; to slow cars down between the corners, but &lt;a href="w%3AScuderia%20Ferrari"&gt;Ferrari&lt;/a&gt; opposed the idea, and ultimately the FIA rejected the idea under regulations.

Actually the FIA rules states that the tyres manufacters should provide two sets of tyres for the race. One normal, optimized for performance, and one optimized for safety, to be used when the normal one set could not be used. In this case the safe set was not present.

The 123,000 fans watching from the stands were unaware of the farce unfolding below them until the parade lap before the race.

The fourteen Michelin runners peeled off into the pit lane rather than take up their starting positions on the grid. However, at least one driver, &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Coulthard"&gt;David Coulthard&lt;/a&gt; told his team that he was willing to race on the tires in question, had the decision been left up to him.

Fans jeered and booed as they realised what was happening, and a small number began throwing bottles and cans onto the track.

&lt;a href="w%3ARubens%20Barrichello"&gt;Rubens Barrichello&lt;/a&gt;, in a &lt;a href="w%3AScuderia%20Ferrari"&gt;Ferrari&lt;/a&gt;, ran over one bottle of water at high speed which exploded in a spray of droplets.

Fans started stamping in the stands on the finish line straight, causing them to shake.

A British &lt;a href="w%3AITV"&gt;ITV&lt;/a&gt; filmcrew spoke to some fans. "I paid $85 for three-day ticket. I travelled nine hours from Baltimore to be here. Indy cars wouldn't do this. &lt;a href="w%3ANASCAR"&gt;NASCAR&lt;/a&gt; wouldn't do this. I'll never attend a race again - only watch on TV."

Other fans had travelled from &lt;a href="w%3AMexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APanama"&gt;Panama&lt;/a&gt; to watch the race, and said they wanted refunds.

A Police Captain also talked to ITV, saying he'd never seen fans as angry as this before. If trouble flared, they could call on 400-500 officers from local and state police, Indianapolis Police Department and the &lt;a href="w%3AFBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; under contingency plans.

The race was eventually won by &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Schumacher"&gt;Michael Schumacher&lt;/a&gt; from his Ferrari teammate Rubens Barrichello. &lt;a href="w%3AJordan%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;Jordan's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATiago%20Monteiro"&gt;Tiago Monteiro&lt;/a&gt; finished third. Despite what was clearly a one-manufacturer race for the win, both Ferrari drivers did indeed race one another hard, with them almost colliding following Schumacher's exit from the pit lane after his second pitstop, with Barrichello having to take to the infield to avoid spinning off. Following the race, the two drivers did not speak.

Friday's elections whittled Iran's field of presidential candidates from eight to two, but the incredibly close vote has led to the scheduling of an unprecedented runoff to be held next Friday.

Candidates &lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud%20Ahmadinezhad"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadizezhad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAli%20Akbar%20Hashemi%20Rafsanjani"&gt;Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani&lt;/a&gt; will square off next week --- unless candidate &lt;a href="w%3AMehdi%20Karroubi"&gt;Mehdi Karroubi&lt;/a&gt; has his way. Karroubi has alleged voting irregularities and has called on Supreme Leader Ayatollah &lt;a href="Ali%20Khamenei"&gt;Ali Khamenei&lt;/a&gt; to investigate. Karroubi alleges that members of the unelected &lt;a href="w%3AGuardian%20Council"&gt;Guardian Council&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AIslamic%20Revolutionary%20Guards%20Corps"&gt;Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps&lt;/a&gt; conspired to rig votes. These charges were seconded late Saturday by reformist candidate &lt;a href="w%3AMostafa%20Moin"&gt;Mostafa Moin&lt;/a&gt;, who had been leading in some pre-election polls but placed third in Friday's vote.

Financial analysts say &lt;a href="Google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; is planning an e-wallet service that could eventually compete with &lt;a href="eBay"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt;'s payment service &lt;a href="PayPal"&gt;PayPal&lt;/a&gt;. Google has not confirmed the development. 

The rumor is a first sign of Google's expected expansion of revenue sources to capitalize on its advertising customer base and search-engine traffic. What form that expansion will take has been a hotly debated subject for the company whose stock valuation momentarily made it the world's biggest media company on June 7, 2005. Even &lt;a href="Microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; has been mentioned as a possible future competitor.

Ebay's stock valuation dipped more than 2% on the news. Paypal currently accounts for one-fifth of the company's revenues. But one business analyst saw potential benefit for Paypal&lt;a href="http%3A//www.thestreet.com/_googlen/tech/kevinkelleher/10228765_2.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, depending on exactly how the "Google Wallet" takes shape. The uncertainty underlined the lack of substantive information behind the rumor.

According to the &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20New%20York%20Times"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, the CEO of a major online merchant, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, was approached by Google to take part in this service. Steve Langdon, a Google spokesperson, declined to comment.

Intense violent turmoil in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; continued Sunday and Monday when attacks across the country killed more than 80 people. A busy restaurant frequented by police officers was the target of the deadliest attack: a suicide bombing that claimed 23 lives and wounded more than 36 others. 

"There were a number of policemen outside the restaurant having tea from Alaa, the tea man. There were two tables with chairs around them where the policemen were sitting. Then a suicide bomber came close to them and blew himself up," said a 29-year-old witness, Qusay Kaabi, according to the &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20Post"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;. "It was a very loud explosion, and the restaurant was filled with smoke and dust."

The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Times"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; reported that, in an aura of resignation, older men just 80 yards away resumed curbside games of checkers even before workers finished cleaning away chunks of flesh. "It's Iraqis who die like this, not Americans," Muhammad Jasem, 25 and unemployed, told the Times. "We never saw this kind of thing before they came." In the capital city alone, more than 600 civilians have perished in the six weeks since Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AIbrahim%20al-Jaafari"&gt;Ibrahim al-Jaafari&lt;/a&gt; named his &lt;a href="w%3AShiite"&gt;Shiite&lt;/a&gt;-led cabinet on April 28.

In &lt;a href="w%3ATikrit"&gt;Tikrit&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday, a man killed himself and five Iraqis while targeting a U.S. military base in a car rigged with explosives. Early Monday, a suicide attacker in &lt;a href="w%3AIbril"&gt;Ibril&lt;/a&gt; detonated his vehicle in a crowd of police recruits. Local officials confirm the blast killed 15 and wounded 100, some severely. The city was cited just yesterday by Foreign Minister &lt;a href="w%3AHoshyar%20Zebari"&gt;Hoshyar Zebari&lt;/a&gt; as one of many relatively stable areas of the country.

The surge in violence has occurred while &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Marines"&gt;U.S. Marines&lt;/a&gt; and Iraqi troops battle insurgents near &lt;a href="w%3AKarabilah"&gt;Karabilah&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="w%3ASyria"&gt;Syrian&lt;/a&gt; border. &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Air%20Force"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AUSAF"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; warplanes pounded targets to support a 1,000 Marine force. A Marine statement also said patrols in the devastated city of &lt;a href="w%3AFallujah"&gt;Fallujah&lt;/a&gt; came under attack Sunday. According to the statement, 15 insurgents were killed while the attack was repulsed.

Four members of a filmcrew have been arrested on suspicion of assault after squirting water at movie star Tom Cruise at the London premiere of the War of the Worlds on Sunday evening.

The crew were freelancers filming a new comedy show for Channel 4. Channel 4 has no production facilities itself; all television programmes are commissioned from independent companies&lt;a href="http%3A//www.channel4.com/about_c4/information.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Cruise had been on a walkabout meeting and greeting fans, and was being interviewed by the crew under the impression that it was a serious interview, when they used a fake microphone to squirt him in the face.

Cruise remained calm throughout. He took hold of the culprit, grasping his wrist, asking him why he did it.

"Why would you do that? What's so funny about that? It's ridiculous. Do you like making less of people?" 

"Don't run away. That's incredibly rude." 

"I'm here giving you an interview, answering your questions and you do something nasty. You're a jerk."

Security guards then took the filmcrew away, before they were arrested and bailed by the police. The crew face further questioning by officers today. 

Scotland Yard have said, "We will see whether to pursue the charges, or see whether the victim wants to pursue it."

Tom Cruise resumed meeting fans and signing autographs, spending an hour in Leicester Square.

The commission had been about to vote on a &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;ese plan to increase its &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aminke%20whale"&gt;minke whale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; catch and to start hunting &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ahumpback%20whale"&gt;humpback whales&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; attempted to stop the adjournment accusing Japan of trying to stall the vote.

&lt;a href="Nauru"&gt;Nauru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="The%20Gambia"&gt;The Gambia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Togo"&gt;Togo&lt;/a&gt; applied to join the commission last week, but have no voting rights until their membership payments are cleared, which could happen any time during the IWC meeting. The three countries are expected to follow Japan's pro-whaling line.

The 66 member body is currently evenly split between pro- and anti-whaling countries.

In an exclusive interview with the &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAbdel%20Hussein%20Shandal"&gt;Abdel Hussein Shandal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AJustice%20Minister"&gt;Justice Minister&lt;/a&gt;, said, "it seems there are lots of secrets they [U.S. government] want to hide."

Shandal accused the U.S. of concealing information about Saddam Hussein and of trying to delay Iraqi interrogations of Hussein. The Iraqi government had said that Saddam's trial would be held within two months, but they are now saying it will be before the end of 2005.

American officials have urged Iraq to be cautious about expediting a trial and have said Iraq needs to have a more established judicial system first. U.S. officials have also stated that the trial might inflame sectarian tensions and interfere with the drafting of an Iraqi constitution.

A &lt;a href="w%3ARomania"&gt;Romanian&lt;/a&gt; priest and four &lt;a href="w%3Anun"&gt;nuns&lt;/a&gt; have been charged in the death of a reportedly &lt;a href="w%3ASchizophrenia"&gt;schizophrenic&lt;/a&gt; nun who was &lt;a href="w%3Acrucifixion"&gt;crucified&lt;/a&gt; in an &lt;a href="w%3Aexorcism"&gt;exorcism&lt;/a&gt;. The novice, Maricica Irina Cornici, of Holy Trinity convent in northeast Romania, died last week after spending three days gagged and chained to a cross without food or water in the church’s cellar.

The 23-year-old nun was found with a towel stuffed into her mouth and had been left in the cold room while the priest delivered prayers to drive out evil spirits. An initial &lt;a href="w%3Aautopsy"&gt;autopsy&lt;/a&gt; revealed the nun died from &lt;a href="w%3Adehydration"&gt;dehydration&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Aexhaustion"&gt;exhaustion&lt;/a&gt; and lack of oxygen. Prosecutors are awaiting the results of a second autopsy, which is being carried out because of a suspicion of foul play. 

The priest, Daniel Petru Corogeanu, and four nuns have been charged with imprisonment leading to death. They could face up to 20 years in prison if found guilty. Father Daniel told local news that he was trying to "take the &lt;a href="w%3Adevil"&gt;devil&lt;/a&gt; out of her". When asked whether the nun was in need of medical help instead of an exorcism, he replied, "You can't take the devil out of people with pills."

Ms. Cornici, who grew up in an orphanage, is said to have entered the remote &lt;a href="w%3Aconvent"&gt;convent&lt;/a&gt; three months earlier. There has been speculation by the Romanian media that Ms. Cornici's schizophrenic behaviour may have caused her fellow nuns and the priest to believe she was &lt;a href="w%3ASpiritual%20possession"&gt;possessed&lt;/a&gt; by the devil. 

The &lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Orthodox%20Church"&gt;Orthodox Church&lt;/a&gt; has condemned the incident and suspended Father Daniel, who has refused to stop work at the Holy Trinity &lt;a href="w%3AMonastery"&gt;monastery&lt;/a&gt;. Riot police had to intervene when scuffles broke out as nuns yelled at a &lt;a href="w%3AVicar"&gt;vicar&lt;/a&gt; who came to suspend Father Daniel on Sunday.

<h1>Lebanese politician George Hawi assassinated as historic elections end</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Lebanese%20politician%20George%20Hawi%20assassinated%20as%20historic%20elections%20end&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A veteran Lebanese politician, &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Hawi"&gt;George Hawi&lt;/a&gt;, was assassinated today in &lt;a href="w%3ABeirut"&gt;Beirut&lt;/a&gt;. Hawi's death came as a grim punctuation mark to the final round of parliamentary elections in Lebanon, the first since Syrian occupation ended earlier this year. Hawi was formerly the secretary of the &lt;a href="w%3ALebanese%20Communist%20Party"&gt;Lebanese Communist Party&lt;/a&gt;. He had long been a Syrian ally, but recently became a critic of Syrian influence in the country.
George Hawi's assassination came on the heels of the conclusion of the last round of &lt;a href="w%3ALebanese%20general%20election%2C%202005"&gt;parliamentary elections&lt;/a&gt; in Lebanon, which saw a coalition of opposition candidates led by &lt;a href="w%3ASaad%20Hariri"&gt;Saad Hariri&lt;/a&gt;, son of former &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Lebanon"&gt;Prime Minister of Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ARafik%20Hariri"&gt;Rafik Hariri&lt;/a&gt;, capture a majority of seats.

Hawi is the third prominent anti-Syrian figure to be assassinated in Lebanon, and the second this month. Rafiq Hariri was assassinated on February 14th; his death led to international pressure for Syria to end its occupation of the country, which it did. More recently, journalist &lt;a href="w%3ASamir%20Kassir"&gt;Samir Kassir&lt;/a&gt; was killed on June 2nd. Hawi's stepson, Rafi Madoyan, said in a statement, "Those who killed him are the same as those who killed Rafiq Hariri and Samir Kassir, it’s the security regime that is in power." &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State"&gt;United States Secretary of State&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACondoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; expressed similar sentiments, accusing Syria of contributing to instability in Lebanon.

In denying the "security regime" allegations, President Emile Lahoud denounced the murder and promised to investigate. "With regard to the persistent suggestion that the president is linked to the so-called security state, everyone knows that he does not directly supervise the security agencies," the presidency said in a statement. "Is it a coincidence that this crime happens today, a few hours after the end of parliamentary elections which the world saw take place democratically?"

Michael Schwerner, 24, Mr Chaney, 21, and Andy Goodman, 20, were killed in 1964. Killen was originally a suspect and was rearrested when new evidence emerged. 

Killen now faces twenty years in jail. He was cleared of carrying out the murder, but convicted of recruiting a gang of Klansmen and police, who abducted the three men, shot them and beat them to death before burying them in a dam.

Commemoration of the &lt;a href="w%3ASrebrenica%20massacre"&gt;Srebrenica massacre&lt;/a&gt; will be held on July 11, when newly identified bodies will be buried. In 1995, Serbian forces, according to &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Criminal%20Tribunal%20for%20the%20Former%20Yugoslavia"&gt;International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt; (ICTY), massacred around 7500 Bosnian Muslims.

A controversy arose after mothers of murdered Muslims in Srebrenica made a statement saying that the Serbian President, &lt;a href="w%3ABoris%20Tadic"&gt;Boris Tadić&lt;/a&gt;, is not welcome in Srebrenica: "Tadić coming to Srebrenica is a planned provocation of the ones who will bury their families on July 11." The Serbian President will still attend the ceremony.

Abdurahman Malkić, the president of the Srebrenica municipality, guaranteed safety to Tadić and all other officials. Other attendees include Theodor Meron, the president of ICTY.

So far, 2,032 bodies have been identified. It is expected that by July 11 another 550 bodies will be identified and ready for burial.

<h2>Reactions in Serbia</h2>

Recent showing of a video which depicts six Bosnian Muslims from Srebrenica being killed by Serbian forces has steered a lot of controversy in Serbia. Bojan Pajtić, the president of the executive board of the northern Serbian province, &lt;a href="w%3AVojvodina"&gt;Vojvodina&lt;/a&gt;, agreed to officially support an initiative of the Independent Journalists' Association of Vojvodina to declare July 11th a Memorial Day in Serbia and Montenegro.

An agency for marketing research, Faktor Plus, published a study on Serbian citizens' reaction on the video. 30.2% of subjects said that they feel sorrow for victims. 43.2% feel anger towards executors of the massacre. 16.3% felt guilt, while one percent was "satisfied" with the video.

On the same day he released his debut solo album, former &lt;a href="w%3ASmashing%20Pumpkins"&gt;Smashing Pumpkins&lt;/a&gt; frontman &lt;a href="w%3ABilly%20Corgan"&gt;Billy Corgan&lt;/a&gt; announced, "I want my band back, and my songs, and my dreams." Those words appeared in a full-page ad&lt;a href="http%3A//www.chicagotribune.com/media/acrobat/2005-06/18118271.pdf"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that ran in Tuesday's edition of the &lt;a href="w%3AChicago%20Tribune"&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/a&gt; under the title, ♡❤A Message to Chicago From Billy Corgan♡❤. The alternative-rock icon also wrote, "For a year now I have walked around with a secret, a secret I chose to keep. But now I want you to be among the first to know that I have made plans to renew and revive The Smashing Pumpkins."

The group, which included guitarist &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Iha"&gt;James Iha&lt;/a&gt;, drummer &lt;a href="w%3AJimmy%20Chamberlin"&gt;Jimmy Chamberlin&lt;/a&gt;, and bassists &lt;a href="w%3AD%27Arcy%20Wretzky"&gt;D'Arcy Wretzky&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMelissa%20Auf%20der%20Maur"&gt;Melissa Auf der Maur&lt;/a&gt;, last played together in . On February 17, 2004, Corgan posted a bitter message on his personal blog calling Wretzky a "mean spirited drug addict" and blaming Iha for the breakup.

It was not clear if Corgan's former band members knew of his plans, or who would be involved with the new group. No other details on the plans were forthcoming from the singer, who lives in the Chicago area.

&lt;a href="w%3AMyron%20Cope"&gt;Myron Cope&lt;/a&gt;, a locally famous sports announcer for the &lt;a href="w%3APittsburgh%20Steelers"&gt;Pittsburgh Steelers&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Football%20League"&gt;National Football League&lt;/a&gt; team, has announced his retirement from the booth, effective immediately. Cope had a 35 year career announcing Steelers games with his familiar scratchy voice, often punctuated with unique &lt;a href="w%3AYiddish"&gt;Yiddish&lt;/a&gt; expressions, such as "Feh" and "Yoi", which brought delight to fans.

Winner of the &lt;a href="w%3ANobel%20Prize%20for%20Physics"&gt;Nobel Prize for Physics&lt;/a&gt; in 2000 for his work on developing the &lt;a href="w%3Aintegrated%20circuit"&gt;integrated circuit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJack%20Kilby"&gt;Jack Kilby&lt;/a&gt; died after battling cancer on Monday, June 20, 2005, in &lt;a href="w%3ADallas%2C%20Texas"&gt;Dallas&lt;/a&gt; at the age of 81. After years of claims, Kilby agreed to share credit for the invention with &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Noyce"&gt;Robert Noyce&lt;/a&gt;, the co-founder of chip maker &lt;a href="w%3Aintel"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt;.

His contribution to the pioneering breakthrough of the integrated circuit was made by Kilby during his employment with &lt;a href="w%3ATexas%20Instruments"&gt;Texas Instruments&lt;/a&gt; (TI) in 1958. He also is credited with co-inventing the handheld &lt;a href="w%3Acalculator"&gt;calculator&lt;/a&gt; which made TI the leader in early consumer electronics development. The integrated circuit paved the way in the development of the microchip used today in computers, &lt;a href="w%3ADVD%20player"&gt;DVD players&lt;/a&gt;, interactive video games and &lt;a href="w%3AMobile%20phone"&gt;cell phones&lt;/a&gt;.

Kilby's work includes the awarding of 60 patents. It was said of him in a statement by TI chairman Tom Engihous that, "In my opinion, there are only a handful of people whose works have truly transformed the world and the way we live in it &amp;mdash; &lt;a href="w%3AHenry%20Ford"&gt;Henry Ford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AThomas%20Edison"&gt;Thomas Edison&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AWright%20Brothers"&gt;Wright Brothers&lt;/a&gt; and Jack Kilby."

In his first year working with TI, Kilby's work on what became the forerunner to the microchip was an invention he fabricated by using a sliver of &lt;a href="w%3Agermanium"&gt;germanium&lt;/a&gt; on a glass slide. This invention was the predecessor to the semiconductor that ultimately replaced vacuum tubes and switching wires then in use as the transistor devices. The invention also led to &lt;a href="w%3Asolid%20state"&gt;solid state electronics&lt;/a&gt; able to withstand more shock and impact in handling.

Kilby is recognised for his 'seminal thought' on the integrated circuit by being awarded the Robert N. Noyce Award in 1995, the &lt;a href="w%3ASemiconductor%20industry"&gt;Semiconductor Industry Association's&lt;/a&gt; highest honor. He is survived by two daughters and five grandchildren.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=U.S.%20Senator%20Biden%20may%20run%20for%20Presidency&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Although the next U.S. presidential election is more than three years away, U.S. senator &lt;a href="w%3AJoseph%20Biden"&gt;Joseph Biden&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ADemocrat"&gt;Democrat&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; &lt;a href="Delaware"&gt;Delaware&lt;/a&gt;) has already announced his intentions of running. Although he originally said in December 2004 that he would wait two years to make a decision, he told ♡❤Face The Nation♡❤ on Sunday that he will spend this year trying to "explore his support", adding, "[I'm going to take my] game on the road, letting people know what I think." He also told the &lt;a href="w%3ACBS"&gt;CBS&lt;/a&gt; news show that he will make his decision as to whether or not to pursue the party's nomination towards the end of this year.

Should he decide to pursue the nomination, Biden may be vying for the nomination alongside several others, including former first lady &lt;a href="w%3AHillary%20Rodham%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Rodham Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, 2004 Democratic candidate &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Kerry"&gt;John Kerry&lt;/a&gt;, and Indiana senator &lt;a href="w%3AEvan%20Bayh"&gt;Evan Bayh&lt;/a&gt;.

Described by Ron Williams in an opinion piece as, "the walking definition of a professional politician," Biden has been vocal in his opposition to the war in Iraq. He is a top-ranking Democrat on the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Foreign%20Relations"&gt;Senate Foreign Relations Committee&lt;/a&gt; where he receives press coverage for his criticism of the U.S. administration's handling of the war.

Biden ran an unsuccessful bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988. Political analysts generally believe that Biden's early announcement for the presidency is good strategy when the hopeful presidential field includes other Democratic heavy weights.

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; today passed an &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AConstitutional%20amendment"&gt;amendment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that would allow &lt;a href="US%20Congress"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt; to prohibit the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFlag%20desecration"&gt;physical desecration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFlag%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;Flag of the United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The bill (H.J.Res.10), whose main sponsor was &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARandy%20%26quot%3BDuke%26quot%3B%20Cunningham"&gt;Randy "Duke" Cunningham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -&lt;a href="California"&gt;Calif.&lt;/a&gt;), was passed by a vote of 286 to 130. The required two-thirds was present. This is the fifth time a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFlag%20Burning%20Amendment"&gt;flag burning amendment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has passed the House. 

The bill will now move on to the &lt;a href="United%20States%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt;, where it stands the best chance of passing ever. If a majority of two-thirds passes the bill, it will then move on to the states to be ratified with a seven-year window open on the ratification. Each time an amendment like this was passed in the House, it died in the Senate, the last time being in 2000.

An informal survey conducted by the Associated Press suggested that the vote will be close &amp;mdash; 34 senators surveyed opposed the amendment, the exact number required to defeat it. However, supporters of the amendment are optimistic that the amendment will pass because four seats were gained by the Republicans in the election last November.

The amendment seeks to bypass the 1989 Supreme Court case ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATexas%20v.%20Johnson"&gt;Texas v. Johnson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ which ruled that desecration of the flag was legal; flag burning was established to be a form of protected speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. In &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, a 22-year-old law banning the destruction of their flag was also &lt;span class="interwiki-link-forced-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFlag%20burning%23New%20Zealand"&gt;recently overturned&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as it was considered an act of free speech.

&lt;a href="w%3ATennessee"&gt;Tennessee&lt;/a&gt; Governor &lt;a href="w%3APhil%20Bredesen"&gt;Phil Bredesen&lt;/a&gt; signed a bill Wednesday authorizing the state's new budget of nearly $26 billion. The new budget increases spending for education and fulfills Bredesen's commitment to decrease &lt;a href="w%3ATennCare"&gt;TennCare&lt;/a&gt; spending. The new budget also includes an increase in spending for the state's preschool program, as much as $100 million in funding for TennCare disenrollees, and a significant contribution to the state's reserve fund.
&lt;p&gt;
Bredesen also signed into law a bill authorizing the &lt;a href="w%3ATennessee%20General%20Assembly"&gt;General Assembly&lt;/a&gt; to begin drafting new ethics laws.

Australia's Deputy Prime Minster &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Anderson%20%28Australian%20politician%29"&gt;John Anderson&lt;/a&gt; resigned today citing health concerns.

Anderson suffers from a benign tumor in his prostate and said he feels that only by cutting back his official and policial commitments would his condition improve.

Anderson also said in a speech to &lt;a href="w%3AParliament%20of%20Australia"&gt;parliament&lt;/a&gt; he will be stepping down as leader of the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;National Party of Australia&lt;/a&gt; -- the junior partner in the current &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;Liberal Party of Australia&lt;/a&gt; coalition government. Deputy Leader of the Nationals Mark Vaile will replace Anderson.

<h1>Zimbabwe bans crop growing in urban areas</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Zimbabwe%20bans%20crop%20growing%20in%20urban%20areas&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Farming in urban areas has been banned in the latest turn in the &lt;a href="Zimbabwe"&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt;an government's 'crackdown' on the country's poor. 

Zimbabwe is in the grip of a chronic drought and with food supplies running low, thousands fear starvation after they were told they could no longer supplement their food supply with crops grown themselves. A police spokesman told a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUN"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; news agency that they were under government instruction to prevent urban farming.

Police spokesman Wayne Bvudzijena said "a lot of harm is being done to the environment. Why can't those who want to cultivate crops go to rural areas, where people are being allocated farms under the land reform programme?"

People living in urban areas had taken to growing their staple crop - maize - and other grains in patches of land near their houses. Much of the land being used had already been earmarked for cultivation, but the police have been told to ignore any such designations.

A non-governmental organisation, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEnvironment%20Africa"&gt;Environment Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , agreed with some of the policy. "We totally understand and appreciate the need for urban people to supplement their incomes, but they should not do it the wrong way. Ideally, farming should be done on farms, not in towns. What we have witnessed is an irreparable damage to the environment, which will certainly have dire consequences for our beloved cities," said an official.

A spokesman for the opposition &amp;mdash; the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMovement%20for%20Democratic%20Change"&gt;Movement for Democratic Change&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (MDC) &amp;mdash; said that while planting on undesignated land, especially amid a maze of houses in townships, was not something they could approve, planting on designated areas should be allowed.

Such urban farming could produce up to 100,000t of grain in a good year, the spokesman added. He believes the government aims to drive urban people &amp;mdash; who are often MDC supporters &amp;mdash; out into the countryside, with the promise of getting land under the "reform program".

As international concern about Zimbabwe grows, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; plans to send a special envoy to assess the situation. However, he has not scheduled a date for the visit.

The Planetary Society have stated that their experimental &lt;a href="w%3Asolar%20sail"&gt;solar sail&lt;/a&gt; craft &lt;a href="w%3ACosmos%201"&gt;Cosmos 1&lt;/a&gt; is probably lost, but intermittent signals have given them some hope the mission has made orbit.

The 100kg vehicle was launched atop a converted ICBM from a Russian nuclear submarine, however it is believed the first stage of the &lt;a href="w%3AVolna"&gt;Volna&lt;/a&gt; booster rocket failed 83 seconds into the flight. The team behind the $4m craft have a slim hope that it managed to reach a low orbit, and efforts to pick up the tracking beacon are continuing.

Signals have apparently been received by at least two tracking stations around the globe - in the Czech Republic, and in the Marshall Islands. The Planetary Society are being assisted by the US Strategic Command in an effort to find the spacecraft, if it did make orbit.

However a scientist from the Czech station has said they have received only noise.

If Cosmos-1 is in orbit, the onboard computer may still be functioning and could begin to unfurl the 30 meter diameter sail in three days time.

A solar sail harnesses pressure exerted upon the sail by &lt;a href="w%3Aphotons"&gt;photons&lt;/a&gt; from the sun to push the craft along. Although its acceleration is very slow, it can go on nearly indefinitely (as long as the Sun exists). It was hoped Cosmos-1 would use a 30 m diameter sail to reach an orbit 800km above the Earth, as a demonstration of the potential of the technology.

Canadian Prime Minister &lt;a href="Paul%20Martin"&gt;Paul Martin's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt; government is planning on passing the same-sex marriage bill, &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20C-38"&gt;Bill C-38&lt;/a&gt;, before the spring session winds up. The gay-marriage bill is being linked with the passage of a $4.6 million budget bill that provides more money directed at social services and foreign aid. The two bills will be the final confidence vote until the fall.

The opposition, the &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Conservative&lt;/a&gt; party, has vowed to do everything it can to defeat the Liberal government unless they pull the vote and wait until fall. Liberal House leader Tony Valeri tabled a notion early Tuesday to extend the spring sitting, delaying the scheduled summer break. The Liberal party is facing resistance from several of its backbenchers, some of who believe the marriage bill should be delayed until the fall.

At least three Liberal MPs have indicated that they might vote against the gay marriage bill along with the Conservatives and the &lt;a href="w%3ABloc%20Qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois"&gt;Bloc Québécois&lt;/a&gt;. If the motion were defeated, the government would be forced to resign.

After a &lt;a href="w%3AHouston%2C%20Texas"&gt;Houston, Texas&lt;/a&gt; television station ♡❤KPRC♡❤ reported on chat room names such as "Girls 13 And Under For Older Guys" and "Girls 13 And Up For Much Older Men" that were aimed at sex with children, the publicly held business ♡❤Yahoo!♡❤ was compelled to act by shutting down all chat rooms created by users and stopped the ability to create new user chat rooms. Online chat rooms created by the company itself are still in service and use.

Major brand name advertisers such as &lt;a href="w%3APepsiCo%2C%20Inc."&gt;PepsiCo Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGeorgia-Pacific"&gt;Georgia-Pacific Corp.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AState%20Farm%20Insurance"&gt;State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACountrywide%20Financial%20Corporation"&gt;Countrywide Mortgage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AT-Mobile"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt; withdrew ads placed on ♡❤Yahoo!♡❤ web pages that may have come under association with the offensive chat rooms. The company is also faced with a lawsuit seeking $10 million in damages that was filed by watchdog groups of internet portals on behalf of the parents and a 12-year-old victim of molestation. A man, who once operated a ♡❤Yahoo Groups♡❤ site where members traded child pornography, is also involved in the suit.

Other internet portals, such as ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAmerica%20Online"&gt;AOL&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMSN"&gt;MSN&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, also allow users to create their own chat rooms. These internet portals are different from ♡❤Yahoo!♡❤ in that they are subscription based, and only allow access to the rooms if the user is a subscriber to the service. ♡❤MSN♡❤ in its earliest versions of chat had monitors watch activity on its servers, but it was abandoned. Efforts to monitor chat for any effect appear to be futile. Geoff Sutton, the European general manager of Microsoft MSN, told ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWired%20News"&gt;Wired News&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ at the time it cut free chat service in 28 countries that, "The straightforward truth of the matter is free, unmediated chat isn't safe."

According to a ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ news story by Duncan Martell, an investigation by the U.S. &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation"&gt;Federal Bureau of Investigation&lt;/a&gt; that was targeted at ♡❤Yahoo Groups♡❤ users resulted in the arrest of more than 100 people in the United States. The lawsuit now brought against ♡❤Yahoo!♡❤ was filed on May 9 in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. It charges that ♡❤Yahoo!♡❤ breached its duties in internet providership by allowing co-defendant Mark Bates and others to share child pornography on a chat room site called 'Candyman'.

♡❤Yahoo!'s♡❤ terms of use requires persons who create chat rooms to agree not to make available content that is "unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, libelous or otherwise objectionable." Legal rulings to date imply that if internet service provider's do monitor the activity in chat rooms, they incur some responsibility for its content, similarly to a publisher's responsibility for the content found in one of its books.

The result is software providers who take a "hands-off" approach grant internet users the ability to add and create content to the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Wide%20Web"&gt;World Wide Web&lt;/a&gt; that opens the door to contributions that range from great to sometimes objectionable, to out-right illegal, and often enlightening.

&lt;a href="w%3ACanada%20%28military%29"&gt;Canadian military&lt;/a&gt; officials are being accused of covering up the use of the deadly chemical agent &lt;a href="w%3AAgent%20Orange"&gt;Agent Orange&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href="w%3Adefoliant"&gt;defoliants&lt;/a&gt; during the 1950s and 1960s at a &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Brunswick"&gt;New Brunswick&lt;/a&gt; base.

At a public meeting attended by at least 200 people, defence officials said only a small amount of the herbicide was used, over a total of seven days between 1966 and 1967 at the army base to clear foliage to prevent fires during artillery training and to clear the view for soldiers. 

The American military was also given permission by the Canadian military to test Agent Orange, Agent Purple, and Agent White during the Vietnam War on less than 500 acres of the Canadian base.

Thursday’s public meeting followed in the aftermath of recent media reports that a U.S. army report indicated the use of Agent Purple, which is considered three-times more toxic than Agent Orange, as part of the spraying program. 

When revelations about the use of Agent Purple first surfaced in mid-June, retired sergeant, Earl Graves, said, “They were out in the exercise area and the planes flew over spraying and they were told to just put ponchos over their head, that it wouldn’t hurt them.”

He said 170 soldiers in his regiment died of cancer and many of them died young.

At the public meeting held Thursday afternoon, angry and fearful civilians and veterans voiced fears that the chemicals were responsible for illnesses later developed.

Veteran John Chisholm said soldiers were told the sprays were harmless and to keep their mouths shut. “Now we found out this stuff here is killing us. No wonder all my buddies are dead.” 

The Defence Department said Thursday that it was conducting tests to determine the dioxin level in the soil and consulting with the U.S. military to find out the exact carcinogen levels in the sprays used.

Judge Marcus Gordon passed sentence on 80 year old &lt;a href="w%3AEdgar%20Ray%20Killen"&gt;Edgar Ray Killen&lt;/a&gt; who was convicted Tuesday of three counts of manslaughter in the &lt;a href="w%3AMississippi%20Civil%20Rights%20Workers%20Murders"&gt;slaying of three civil rights workers&lt;/a&gt; in 1964. The judge sentenced Killen to the maximum 20 years for each count -- a total of 60 years.

Judge Gordon noted some people "would say a sentence of 10 years would be a life sentence" for Killen. The minimum time Killen could serve is one-third, or 20 years.

The conviction came 41 years to the day after James Chaney, Michael Schwerner and Andrew Goodman were murdered. They had been registering minority votes in Mississippi during the "&lt;a href="w%3AFreedom%20Summer"&gt;Freedom Summer&lt;/a&gt;" of 1964.

Killen's attorneys say they will appeal the verdict.

Popular &lt;a href="w%3ASerbian"&gt;Serbian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Abasketball"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt; player &lt;a href="w%3AAleksandar%20Djordjevic"&gt;Aleksandar "Sasha" Djordjevic&lt;/a&gt; will play his last game in &lt;a href="w%3ABelgrade"&gt;Belgrade&lt;/a&gt; on July 3. More then 60 players and coaches who worked with Djordjevic throughout his career will attend the game, and all ticket proceedings will go to the &lt;a href="w%3AUNICEF"&gt;UNICEF&lt;/a&gt; "School without violence" program.

Djordjevic played in the Yugoslavian, Italian, &lt;a href="w%3AAsociaci%C3%B3n%20de%20Clubs%20de%20Baloncesto"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Basketball%20Association"&gt;NBA&lt;/a&gt; leagues, as well as for the Yugoslavian national team. The 38 year-old won two European Championships and one World Championship. He is retireing as a player of &lt;a href="w%3AArmani%20Jeans%20Milano"&gt;Armani Jeans Milano&lt;/a&gt; and an MVP of the ♡❤Lega A Basket♡❤.

"Everything hurts: my shoulder, elbow and joint. Everything ends, and so does a basketball career. They still have to invent medicines that would ease this pain," said Djordjevic.

&lt;a href="w%3ACroatian"&gt;Croatian&lt;/a&gt; basketball player &lt;a href="w%3ADino%20Radja"&gt;Dino Radja&lt;/a&gt; decided not to come to Belgrade. He told Djordjevic that he doesn't want any booing, which would ruin the farewell game.

A &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Brunswick"&gt;New Brunswick&lt;/a&gt; judge ruled in favour of same-sex marriage in a &lt;a href="w%3AMoncton%2C%20New%20Brunswick"&gt;Moncton&lt;/a&gt; court today. Court of the Queen's Bench Judge Judy Clendening ruled in favour of four gay couples who argued that New Brunswick's current definition of marriage violated their rights.

In a written decision, the judge said that the definition of civil marriage would have to be changed from a lawful union between a man and a woman to a lawful union "between two persons." It gives New Brunswick a 10-day grace period to implement this change.

Alison Menard, the lawyer who represented the couples, says that in effect same-sex marriage is now permitted in New Brunswick. "What it means is that anybody that meets the definition of capacity to marry is able to go and get a marriage licence," Menard said. "So in this particular circumstance, couples of same gender will be able to obtain marriage licences and celebrate marriages."

As a result of this ruling, same-sex marriage is permitted in all Canadian provinces and territories except &lt;a href="w%3AAlberta"&gt;Alberta&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3ANorthwest%20Territories"&gt;Northwest Territories&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANunavut"&gt;Nunavut&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APrince%20Edward%20Island"&gt;Prince Edward Island&lt;/a&gt;.

Although Premier &lt;a href="w%3ABernard%20Lord"&gt;Bernard Lord&lt;/a&gt; has said he believes in traditional (heterosexual) marriage, he will not put up a fight if the courts or Parliament decide otherwise.

Several religious groups applied for intervener status in the case to argue against same-sex unions, but they were turned down by Judge Clendening on the grounds that her ruling would not preclude churches from opting not to perform same-sex unions.

The minority &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt; government in the Canadian &lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20of%20Commons%20of%20Canada"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt; is pushing ahead with the legalization of same-sex marriage nationwide in the controversial &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20C-38"&gt;Bill C-38&lt;/a&gt;, even though courts have legalized it in most provinces and territories of Canada.

&lt;a href="w%3APhumzile%20Mlambo-Ngcuka"&gt;Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka&lt;/a&gt; was sworn in as deputy president of South Africa Thursday becoming the first woman ever to hold that position. Other Cabinet members applauded as she was sworn in to office in &lt;a href="w%3ACape%20Town"&gt;Cape Town&lt;/a&gt;. Her appointment comes after &lt;a href="South%20African%20president%20dismisses%20deputy%20on%20implications%20of%20corruption"&gt;former deputy president Jacob Zuma was sacked after being accused of corruption&lt;/a&gt; relating to a bribery scandal.

She stated that she will perform much the same function as &lt;a href="w%3AJacob%20Zuma"&gt;Zuma&lt;/a&gt;, namely "looking after the second economy", HIV/AIDS issue, and other assignments President Thabo Mbeki give her. "I will be looking after women and youth," she also said.

Mlambo-Ngcuka, a former school teacher, travelled to Geneva, Switzerland to work with the &lt;a href="w%3AYWCA"&gt;YWCA&lt;/a&gt;. She returned to South Africa in 1987 and assumed a leading role in the &lt;a href="w%3AEcumenism"&gt;Ecumenical&lt;/a&gt; Action Group and other anti-&lt;a href="w%3AApartheid"&gt;apartheid&lt;/a&gt; groups. She was later elected to parliament and appointed deputy trade and industry minister.

In 2003 she publicly accused Jacob Zuma of corruption, though the case was never formalized due to insufficient evidence. Her husband, former national director of Public Prosecutions &lt;a href="w%3ABulelani%20Ngcuka"&gt;Bulelani Ngcuka&lt;/a&gt;, investigated Zuma and concluded that prima facie evidence of corruption existed.

Individuals opposed to her appointment accuse her of involvement in the transfer of large sums of taxpayers' money to the &lt;a href="w%3AAfrican%20National%20Congress"&gt;African National Congress&lt;/a&gt;' election fund through an oil company. Her brother, who asserts that the transaction was completely above board, has been implicated in South African news reports.

He told the BBC: "South Africa refuses to accept the notion that because suddenly we're going to a &lt;a href="w%3AG8"&gt;G8&lt;/a&gt; summit, we must be reminded that we must look good and appease the G8 leaders. We will do things because we believe they are correct and right."

The leaders have said that Zimbabwe's actions, which have made an estimated 200,000 homeless, destroyed businesses and stopped farming in urban areas, are justified to restore order in the country. 

Yesterday a coalition of 200 human rights groups, both African and international, also demanded that the issue be discussed at the AU. In the press release for &lt;a href="w%3AAmnesty%20International"&gt;Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt;, a representative of the coalition said: "The appointment of a UN Special Envoy to investigate the mass violations taking place in Zimbabwe is welcome. But effective action must also be taken immediately to help those already sleeping on the streets, beside the rubble of their homes and to ensure that the evictions and demolitions stop immediately."

"The AU and UN simply cannot ignore such an unprecedented, wide-ranging appeal on behalf of the people of Zimbabwe, particularly from African civil society. African solidarity should be with the people of Africa - not their repressive leaders."

240,000 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AU2%20%28band%29"&gt;U2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ] fans are preparing for &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Ireland's&lt;/a&gt; most successful band ever to return for a hometown gig in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADublin"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The supergroup is playing Friday, Saturday and Monday in front of 80,000 people a night at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACroke%20Park"&gt;Croke Park&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGarda%C3%AD"&gt;Gardaí&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have put in place a massive traffic management plan to cope with the influx of people. Fans have been queing since Thursday morning when a group of fans from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHolland"&gt;Holland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; started queuing outside the stadium.

The concert forms part of U2's current "&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHow%20to%20Dismantle%20an%20Atomic%20Bomb"&gt;Vertigo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; " world tour. The support acts include emerging Irish bands &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASnow%20Patrol"&gt;Snow Patrol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Thrills"&gt;The Thrills&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; along with already very popular Paddy Casey. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAsh%20%28band%29"&gt;Ash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Bravery"&gt;The Bravery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; will cap it off as warm up acts on Monday.

The gates for the gig will open at 4pm with the actual band not expected until around 8.30pm. Irish media has entered a frenzied anticipation of the concert all this week, with constant coverage on radio stations. The national broadcaster, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ART%C3%89"&gt;RTÉ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , is set to dedicated almost 3hr 30min to the band with an exclusive interview by Dave Fanning forming the centerpiece of the stations coverage of the "U2 weekend". &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AColdplay"&gt;Coldplay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; frontman &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Martin"&gt;Chris Martin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who played in front of a sell out crowd in Dublin earlier this week told fans that U2 were "still the best band in the world".

Croke Park is the fourth largest stadium in &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;, with an official capacity of 82,000 - bigger than both &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACardiff"&gt;Cardiff's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMillennium%20Stadium"&gt;Millennium Stadium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AParis"&gt;Paris'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStade%20de%20France"&gt;Stade de France&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Croke Park is used to host GAA matches in sports such as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ahurling"&gt;hurling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGaelic%20football"&gt;Gaelic football&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and regularly attracts audiences of 60,000 or more in the summer months.

Since July 2, 2004 the Elbe Valley near &lt;a href="w%3ADresden"&gt;Dresden&lt;/a&gt; has been in the process of becoming a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Friday saw the hand over of the documents in Castle Albrechtsberg confirming the status. Today, mayor Roßberg and Professor Bandarin will unveil a plaque in the church of Loschwitz - starting the Elbe Valley celebrations.

The cultural landscape consists of an 18 km long strip along the &lt;a href="w%3AElbe"&gt;Elbe&lt;/a&gt; between Soebrigen and the Dresden bridge Flügelwegbrücke. It includes the ancient city of Dresden, the many castles along the river Elbe, the town centres of the small villages near the river as well as the very famous &lt;a href="w%3APillnitz"&gt;Castle Pillnitz&lt;/a&gt;.

The city of Dresden sees the status as an internationally-effecting advertisement for investors and tourists in the acknowledgment as a site of world heritage. By this status it will give no further restrictions for the UNESCO. The possibility "of a developing culture landscape" granted itself.

The total number of people killed and injured by police officers driving cars in the course of their duties in England and Wales has risen by 61% in just one year.

The figures were released by Home Office minister Hazel Blears in a written answer to a question from Lynne Featherstone, MP for Hornsey and Wood Green in London.

They show that in 2002-2003, a total of 22 people were killed and 1,131 were injured.

But in 2003-2004, the number killed has increased to 31, with more than 2,000 injured, of which 138 were serious.

All the people killed or injured were involved in road traffic collisions with police vehicles responding to emergency calls, or those involved in high-speed pursuits.

The police force with the worst record for deaths is Greater Manchester Police. Four people died in collisions involving GMP vehicles in 2002-2003, but the number increased to 6 the following year. However, the number injured dropped from 74 to 56 over the same period.

The safest force was Dyfed-Powys Police, who did not kill or injure anyone in both years. The force covers a rural area of Wales, with a low population density.

Independent Police Complaints Commission Chair Nick Hardwick issued a statement in response to the figures.

Training and risk assessment are the keys to reducing deaths and serious injuries involving police drivers", he said.

"We all accept that in emergencies police officers have to speed and go through red lights but they must not take unacceptable risks, either for themselves or the public."

"The IPCC will continue to manage or independently investigate the most serious collisions involving police driving. We are ensuring that the lessons learned will benefit the police service."

In &lt;a href="w%3AAnn%20Arbor"&gt;Ann Arbor, Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APolice"&gt;Law Enforcement Officer&lt;/a&gt; Keith Robins was disciplined for his actions related to an investigation of an &lt;a href="w%3Arobbery"&gt;armed robbery&lt;/a&gt;. Two males and two females were suspected of robbing a Shell gas station, and one boy was described as having red hair and red pants. Robins was searching the surrounding area approximately 3.2 miles away from the incident when he found a group of ten people that included one male matching the red hair, red pants description.

Robins had spoken to another officer just minutes earlier to discuss how to handle the potential suspects. They decided "that the best way to handle the situation was probably to advise them to all get on the ground, possibly at gunpoint, if the circumstances warranted," Robins wrote.

The group stopped by Robins included seven male students and three teachers from &lt;a href="http%3A//stone.aaps.k12.mi.us/main.html"&gt;Stone School&lt;/a&gt; who were out for a walk. Robins detained this group until backup could arrive to confirm their identities and whether or not they were involved in the armed robbery. They were released after back-up officers arrived and it was determined the students were not the suspects.

Officer Keith Robins has returned to active duty. He was placed on desk duty and paid administrative leave during the investigation of the April 11 incident.

Police Chief Daniel Oates remarked "I'm proud to say that the officer involved recognized his mistake and offered to go to the school to apologize to the students and staff who were affected; for various reasons, that did not occur, but it says a lot about our officer that he extended that offer."

School district spokeswoman Liz Margolis said officials were informed of the conclusion of the internal investigation. She said school staff members and parents jointly decided not to accept Robins' offer to personally apologize, but said police officials had visited the school twice after the incident to talk to students.

"The school has moved beyond this, so they felt they didn't want to bring it up again," Margolis said. "The police department has kept up good communication with the school through the entire investigative process."

According to Ann Arbor Police Department documents there are defined levels of "Use of Force" for differing circumstances. When determining which level is needed officers "responses should be based upon:
<ul>
BULLET::::- Physical size, strength and weaponry of the person(s) compared to the officer(s)
BULLET::::- Nature of the encounter
BULLET::::- Actions of the person(s)
BULLET::::- Exigent conditions (i.e., availability of backup)"

</ul>
The force level used by the officer in drawing his gun was a level one response, the lowest possible response level, described as: "Officer Presence/Verbal Direction: ... Uniformed presence or identification as a police officer, verbal direction, or use of restraint devices (i.e. compliant handcuffing)." Levels two through five responses consist of the use of batons; empty hand techniques (pressure points, striking, take downs); impact weapons; pepper spray; and deadly force.

<h1>U.S. Supreme Court eases government ability to seize property</h1>
♡❤♡, ♡❤♡ 

In a major decision, the &lt;a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;Supreme Court of the United States&lt;/a&gt; has expanded the right of government to seize private property for public good by allowing the city of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20London%2C%20Connecticut"&gt;New London&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Connecticut"&gt;Connecticut&lt;/a&gt; to invoke &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aeminent%20domain"&gt;eminent domain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and seize homeowners' property for economic development reasons.

In a closely-divided decision, 5&amp;ndash;4, the court determined that the city's economic development plan constituted a "public use", and therefore qualified under the &lt;a href="U.S.%20Constitution"&gt;U.S. Constitution&lt;/a&gt;'s fifth amendment's Eminent Domain clause.

Justice &lt;a href="John%20Paul%20Stevens"&gt;John Paul Stevens&lt;/a&gt; wrote the majority decision, and was joined by Justices &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20H.%20Souter"&gt;David H. Souter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Ruth%20Bader%20Ginsburg"&gt;Ruth Bader Ginsburg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20G.%20Breyer"&gt;Stephen G. Breyer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAnthony%20Kennedy"&gt;Anthony Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . "Promoting economic development is a traditional and long accepted function of government," Stevens wrote, and justified the decision further by saying municipal authorities are better positioned to make decisions regarding a community's best interests than judges.

Writing the dissenting opinion, Justice &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASandra%20Day%20O%27Connor"&gt;Sandra Day O'Connor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; rejected the economic justification as a public use, pointing out that wealthy individuals are more capable of defending themselves and so are less at risk. But the greatest issue was the likelihood of abuse of eminent domain:

"The specter of condemnation hangs over all property. Nothing is to prevent the state from replacing any &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMotel%206"&gt;Motel 6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARitz-Carlton"&gt;Ritz-Carlton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , any home with a shopping mall or any farm with a factory." A separate dissent was also included written by Justice &lt;a href="Clarence%20Thomas"&gt;Clarence Thomas&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASeoul"&gt;Seoul&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — More than 300 "citizen reporters" hailing from countries as far apart as &lt;a href="Chile"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Norway"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt; are coming together at the OhmyNews International Citizen Reporters' Forum from June 23 to June 26, 2005 in Seoul. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOhmyNews"&gt;OhmyNews&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is one of the most popular &lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;n news websites, and it has played an important role in the election of reformist President Roh Moo-hyun. Unlike traditional news sources, OhmyNews allows any individual with an Internet connection to contribute stories. A professional staff of journalists vets incoming submissions and decides which stories are to be published.

The project is sponsoring the forum in order to promote its English edition, officially launched in May 2004. Citizen reporters writing in English exchange ideas and stories, and try to understand the inner workings of the Korean edition. The conference is sponsored by Korean corporations such as Samsung, SK Corporation, LG, Yuhan-Kimberly, and Asiana Airlines.
<h2>Conference events</h2>

Speakers include Ken Takeuchi, president of JanJan, Shintaro Tabata, head of news service at Japan’s Livedoor, Professor Clyde Bentley from the University of Missouri and MyMissourian.com, Professor Neil Thurman from City University London, Jeremy Iggers from the Minneapolis Star Tribune, and Erik Möller from Wikinews.

Conference participants were welcomed by OhmyNews founder and CEO &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOh%20Yeon%20Ho"&gt;Oh Yeon Ho&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on Thursday evening. On Friday, they toured briefly through Seoul's technology sector, including a visit to the "Ubuiquitous Dream" exhibition and Samsung's technology showroom. "Ubiquitous Dream" is meant to demonstrate Korea's vision of ubiquitous computing, including Internet-enabled refrigerators, household robots and voice recognition. Afterwards, conference attendees visited the OhmyNews news room, including a studio used for producing streaming video. 
Visitors were given a chance to take a look at the Cheonggyecheon restoration site, an attempt to transform a riverbed into an avenue with parks and fountains. The restoration project manager gave an overview of the effort, and Seoul's mayor Lee Myung Bak briefly highlighted his vision of Korean city development.

At the end of Friday's events, speakers and citizen reporters alike met in the Grand Ballroom of the COEX Convention and Exhibition Center. Oh Yeon Ho gave a brief but passionate speech about his project: "We are from different countries and many of us have a different skin color, but we share one struggle: Every citizen is a journalist." He stated that citizen journalism needs "sustainable business models" to survive. OhmyNews is funded by advertising and subscriptions. He also pointed out the need for different citizen journalism projects to collaborate, and announced the creation of a global alliance to this end.

After Oh's speech, Chin Dae Je, South Korea's Minister of Information and Communication, gave a presentation about ubiquitous computing and the future of the information and communications technology sector in Korea. Lastly, many different citizen reporters, including an 11-year-old from Utah, told their stories about how they joined the OhmyNews community and participated in group photos and a flag ceremony.

<h1>President Mugabe bulldozes homes of 200,000 across Zimbabwe</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=President%20Mugabe%20bulldozes%20homes%20of%20200%2C000%20across%20Zimbabwe&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3AZimbabwe"&gt;Zimbabwean&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="Robert%20Mugabe"&gt;Mugabe&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AOperation%20Murambatsvina"&gt;Operation Murambatsvina&lt;/a&gt; ("Drive out rubbish") has seen at least 200,000 people made homeless in Zimbabwe as the government bulldozes "illegal" homes, buildings and markets.

The opposition has said the operation is designed to "punish" those who object to Mugabe's government.

Two children under the age of two have been killed, the first deaths reported so far in the actions which have been taking place for a month now. 

International pressure is building on Zimbabwe to stop. British Foreign Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJack%20Straw%20%28politician%29"&gt;Jack Straw&lt;/a&gt; has been joined by U.S. Secretary of State &lt;a href="w%3ACondoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; in condemning the evictions and urging African leaders to speak out.

The government has said the buildings it is destroying are "illegal", and have said that the "black markets" are to blame for the country's "economic meltdown". Over 70% of the population is unemployed.

The bulldozers have the protection of armed police as they do their work. Sometimes the police have forced homeowners to carry out the destruction themselves.

At other times, the government has claimed it is destroying the buildings to get rid of unsafe structures and to reduce overcrowding. Other children have died when the walls of their houses have collapsed.

The authorities are also preventing non-governmental organisations from providing aid to those who have lost their homes.

The country currently needs to import 1.2 million tonnes of food to avoid famine as rural farming production drops.

Iranians are voting in Iran's first follow up run-off presidential election today as no candidate received more than 50% in last weeks election. The polls opened at 0430 UTC.

The choice is between conservative candidate &lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud%20Ahmadinejad"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt; (now mayor of Tehran) who has promised the poor a greater share of Iran's oil revenues and &lt;a href="w%3AAkbar%20Hashemi%20Rafsanjani"&gt;Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani&lt;/a&gt; who was considered a conservative candidate in the past but now portrays himself as a reform candidate. Rafsanjani has committed himself to keeping the reforms started by outgoing President Mohammad Khatami.

Iran has a very young population and it is reported the country is divided between a more open westernized society and a return (continuation) of an Islamic society.

Regardless of which candidate wins, final outcomes are still controlled by Iran's unelected Clerical Ruling Council.

<h1>US city police officer disciplined for drawing gun/Notes</h1>
An anonymous source provided me with the document outlining use of force in the Ann Arbor Police Department. It is a FOIA-able document. I will quote the relevant sections. All bolding, underlining, etc. comes from the original document.

The PPCT/&lt;b&gt;M.C.O.L.E.S.&lt;/b&gt; Force Continuum was designed to give officers a model in which to learn the various levels of subject resistance and the appropriate subject control response. This continuum is only a model, and the officer'(s) subject control response should be based upon:
<ul>
BULLET::::- Physical size, strength, and weaponry of the person(s) compared to the officer(s).
BULLET::::- Nature of the encounter.
BULLET::::- Actions of the person(s).
BULLET::::- Exigent conditions (i.e., availability of back-up, number of persons involved).

</ul>
For example, an officer may resort to the use of mace before using hard empty hand controls if the officer believes the use of hard empty hand controls would be ineffective.

&lt;a href="w%3AMTV%20Networks"&gt;MTV Networks'&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMTV"&gt;MTV&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AVH1"&gt;VH1&lt;/a&gt; have secured the rights to distribute over cable networks the &lt;a href="w%3ALive%208"&gt;Live 8&lt;/a&gt; series of concerts which will be taking place at 8 venues in Europe, North America and Japan. The concerts are meant to raise awareness of poverty in Africa and charitable donations to fight it. 

&lt;a href="w%3AAmerica%20Online"&gt;America Online&lt;/a&gt; holds the rights to broadcast Live 8 over the Internet and is currently in talks with &lt;a href="w%3AABC"&gt;American Broadcasting Company&lt;/a&gt; to also broadcast the concert.

MTV, VH1, and its college network, &lt;a href="w%3AmtvU"&gt;mtvU&lt;/a&gt; will broadcast the concert from noon to 8 PM. This will be the second outing for MTV, as they broadcasted the original Live Aid concert. If ABC decides to air the concert as well, this will also be their second going as well. According to MTV, this is the longest MTV has gone without a televised event since the coverage of the violent, riot-filled &lt;a href="w%3AWoodstock%201999"&gt;Woodstock 1999&lt;/a&gt;.

Two radio networks will also broadcast the concert. The subscription-based &lt;a href="w%3AXM%20Satellite%20Radio"&gt;XM Satellite Radio&lt;/a&gt; will broadcast the original five announced concerts but will not broadcast the &lt;a href="w%3ATokyo"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3ABarrie"&gt;Barrie&lt;/a&gt; concerts. &lt;a href="w%3APremiere%20Radio%20Networks"&gt;Premiere Radio Networks&lt;/a&gt; will broadcast the concerts tailored to the three genres of &lt;a href="w%3Aurban"&gt;urban&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Arock"&gt;rock and roll&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Apop"&gt;pop music&lt;/a&gt;.

Some of the performers slated are: &lt;a href="w%3AU2"&gt;U2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AColdplay"&gt;Coldplay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMadonna"&gt;Madonna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADave%20Matthews%20Band"&gt;Dave Matthews Band&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJay-Z"&gt;Jay-Z&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADestiny%27s%20Child"&gt;Destiny's Child&lt;/a&gt; and a reunited &lt;a href="w%3APink%20Floyd"&gt;Pink Floyd&lt;/a&gt;.

Around two hundred people got involved in a mass fight in central &lt;a href="w%3AMoscow"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt; yesterday. Fists and baseball bats were used in a quarrel over land property between employees of two firms. At one point, a few concrete blocks and bricks flew.

&lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; firm Real-Impex (Реал-Импекс) owns property in Granatny Pereulok (Гранатный Переулок), that was due for some time to be transferred to another firm. However, the deal was broken in yet unknown circumstances. The fight arose as a way to settle scores.

Five people were hospitalized for injuries. &lt;a href="w%3AITAR-TASS"&gt;ITAR-TASS&lt;/a&gt; reports that 68 people were arrested, questioned and allowed to go home.

&lt;a href="w%3AGreece"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; workers' &lt;a href="w%3Atrade%20union"&gt;unions&lt;/a&gt; claim that 70 to 100% of country's workforce has joined the general 24 hour long strike on Friday. The general strike was called by labor umbrella organizations as a show of support for striking bank employees, who are in their third week of strikes.

Private and public sector workers alike are protesting mass lay-offs, alleged age discrimination against employees, the lowering of pensions to 40% of former salary, the repudiation of &lt;a href="w%3Acollective%20bargaining"&gt;collective bargaining agreements&lt;/a&gt;, while voicing support for the retention of the eight-hour work day.

Buses operated between 8am until 9pm, while the metro, railway, and trams did not operate at all. Administration and civil servants stopped working for three hours during the day. Banks are working with emergency personnel, causing a shortage of currency and slowing commercial and financial transactions. The president of the security guards' union, which includes employees responsible for filling &lt;a href="w%3Aautomatic%20teller%20machine"&gt;automatic teller machines&lt;/a&gt; estimates that most machines will run out of money sometime tomorrow.

Workers in other branches of the private sector, including shipping and tourism, also went on strike for a day. The private sector accounts for roughly half the Greek workforce, with the other half are employed in the public sector.

Independent estimates or reports on impact of the general strike are hard to find, as media workers has joined in the walkout, and broadcast news outlets did not operate at all from 1pm to 5pm. 

The strikes were followed by protests in several Greek cities.

The &lt;a href="w%3AEconomy%20of%20Greece"&gt;Greek economy&lt;/a&gt; continues to grow, but growth has slowed since the close of the &lt;a href="w%3A2004%20Summer%20Olympics"&gt;2004 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt; and analysts had expected economic and political turmoil this summer. Greece had a high GDP growth rate prior to 2004, when it reached 4.1%. However, it is expected that for 2005, it will be around 2.7%. Additionally, a recent survey by the National Statistics Service estimates the national poverty rate to be 20%, despite recent economic progress.

A controversial proposal by &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Democracy"&gt;New Democracy&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ACostas%20Caramanlis"&gt;Costas Caramanlis&lt;/a&gt; would overhaul the country's &lt;a href="w%3ASocial%20Security"&gt;Social Security&lt;/a&gt; system to include bank employees, who until now have had separate pension schemes and largely oppose the merger.

Ten men and three women allegedly linked to the &lt;a href="w%3ACIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; have been ordered arrested by an Italian judge for allegedly kidnapping a terrorism suspect in Italy and then secretly taking him to Egypt where he said he was &lt;a href="w%3Atorture"&gt;tortured&lt;/a&gt;. The Italian prosecutors office confirmed the arrest warrants relating to the abduction of imam Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr on Feb. 17, 2003. An unnamed judicial source said; "In the judge's order, it (the abduction) is clearly attributed to the CIA."

The CIA's response to the allegation was: "We're not commenting. We're saying: if we have anything to say, we'll get back to you."

Human rights groups have criticised the CIA in the past for the practise known as &lt;a href="w%3Aextraordinary%20rendition"&gt;extraordinary rendition&lt;/a&gt;. According to these groups, it involves moving suspects from the country where they are captured to a third country where torture is routinely used during interrogations. A number of ex-detainees have alleged that they were tortured in countries such as Egypt and Syria after being captured by the CIA. &lt;a href="w%3AMaher%20Arar"&gt;Maher Arar&lt;/a&gt;, a Candadian citizen, sued the US Government earlier this year, claiming that he was sent to Syria, his country of birth, and tortured for a number of months before the Canadian government obtained his release. The suit was dismissed under the rarely used &lt;a href="w%3AState%20Secrets%20Privilege"&gt;State Secrets Privilege&lt;/a&gt;.

In January President Bush said in an interview with the New York Times that, "torture is never acceptable, nor do we hand over people to countries that do torture."

Much of Friday's &lt;a href="w%3ASerbia"&gt;Serbian&lt;/a&gt; Parliament session was spent accusing domestic &lt;a href="w%3Anon-governmental%20organization"&gt;non-governmental organization&lt;/a&gt;s (NGO) of spreading anti-Serbian sentiments. 

The discussion was started by &lt;a href="w%3ATomislav%20Nikolic"&gt;Tomislav Nikolić&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3ASerbian%20Radical%20Party"&gt;Serbian Radical Party&lt;/a&gt;, who criticized Nataša Kandić and her Humanitarian Law Center for publicly accusing Nikolić of war crimes in &lt;a href="w%3AYugoslav%20wars"&gt;former Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;.

Last week, Kandić announced that she has evidence of Nikolić's personal involvement in killings of civilian Croatian population in village Antin in December 1991. Nikolić responded that he was a "regular volunteer", and that while he was in Antin no one was killed. About 50 elderly Croats were reported as murdered by Serbian volunteer forces and the &lt;a href="w%3AYugoslavian%20People%27s%20Army"&gt;Yugoslavian People's Army&lt;/a&gt;.

Aleksandar Vučić, also a member of Serbian Radical Party said: "The sort of banditry by which you accuse innocent people of the worst possible things will have to stop and [accusers] will be held responsible. When you have people like that, such pathological liars, you can't do much."

In addition to the opposition Serbian Radical party, who hold the most seats in parliament, members of the ruling parties also voiced their concerns.

Miloš Aligrudić of &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20of%20Serbia"&gt;Democratic Party of Serbia&lt;/a&gt; (DSS), the leading government party, said that "People like Kandić should not cause distinguished representatives to have to defend themselves in front of the Parliament." 

Dragoljub Kojčić (DSS) expressed his opinion that there is an "hysterical campaign against the interests of Serbia" led by the non-governmental sector "which, as their finances reveal, are representatives of power centers outside of our country." Kojčić proposed creation of "a committee for finding the truth about Srebrenica in the part for which there are insinuations of Serbian involvement by NGOs."

The only party taking an dissenting was opposition &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28Serbia%29"&gt;Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt;. Dušan Petrović told journalists that "it is not true that NGOs are leading anti-Serbian campaign ... I don't think that any action aimed at bringing criminals to justice is negative in any way."

Seven months after suspicions were first raised, United States Agriculture Secretary &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Johanns"&gt;Mike Johanns&lt;/a&gt; confirmed that a second American cow has tested positive for &lt;a href="w%3ABovine%20spongiform%20encephalopathy"&gt;BSE&lt;/a&gt; (also known as 'mad cow disease'), as determined by a lab in &lt;a href="w%3AWeybridge"&gt;Weybridge, England&lt;/a&gt;. The department believes that this cow was born in the United States.

The delay in confirmation followed two conflicting test results from last November. The &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20blot"&gt;"Western blot"&lt;/a&gt; test, which is a more sophisticated test, could have helped reach a final determination, but the U.S. refused to perform it in November. The department's inspector general, Phyllis Fong, ordered the Western blot test in June without advising Johanns and by the time Johanns found out about it, the testing was under way.

Johanns was annoyed that the round of testing which confirmed "Mad Cow" had been ordered without him being consulted first."I was asked by the Senate and the president to operate the department," Johanns said. "I believe, in this area, very clearly, the secretary should be consulted, whoever the secretary is, before testing is undertaken. From my standpoint, I believe I was put there to operate the department and was very disappointed."

A senior research associate with Consumers Union, Michael Hansen, said &lt;a href="w%3AUSDA"&gt;USDA&lt;/a&gt; officials "almost sound like some &lt;a href="w%3AKeystone%20Kops"&gt;Keystone Kops&lt;/a&gt;."

Johanns reassured Americans that they should not be afraid of eating beef, saying: "This animal was blocked from entering the food supply because of the firewalls we have in place. Americans have every reason to continue to be confident in the safety of our beef."

On June 17, the Associated Press reported: "American cattle are eating chicken litter, cattle blood and restaurant leftovers that could help transmit mad cow disease — a gap in the U.S. defense that the Bush administration promised to close nearly 18 months ago."

&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Stauber"&gt;John Stauber&lt;/a&gt;, co-author of "Mad Cow USA: Could the Nightmare Happen Here?" said: "Once the cameras were turned off and the media coverage dissipated, then it's been business as usual, no real reform, just keep feeding slaughterhouse waste. The entire U.S. policy is designed to protect the livestock industry's access to slaughterhouse waste as cheap feed."

Critics of the U.S. testing regimen said the fumbles this time increase their concerns about America's screening process.

"How can we be sure they were really negative?" Craig Culp, a spokesman for the Center for Food Safety asked; "After all, (here is a cow that was) negative in November that is positive in June."

The companies which render slaughter waste say new restrictions are not warranted. "We process about 50 billion pounds of product annually — in visual terms, that is a convoy of semi trucks, four lanes wide, running from New York to L.A. every year," said Jim Hodges, president of the American Meat Institute Foundation.

&lt;a href="Mahmoud%20Ahmadinejad"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt;, Tehran's hardline conservative mayor, has won the Iranian presidential election with a landslide of 61.8%, according to Iran's Interior Ministry. "The figures show that Ahmadinejad is the winner," Ministry spokesman &lt;a href="w%3AJahanbakhsh%20Khanjani"&gt;Jahanbakhsh Khanjani&lt;/a&gt; said to reporters. His rival Ayatollah &lt;a href="w%3AHashemi%20Rafsanjani"&gt;Hashemi Rafsanjani&lt;/a&gt; received 35.7% of the vote. An estimated 23 million votes were cast -- making voter turnout nearly 49 per cent. This runoff is the first since the Islamic Revolution in 1979. 

Ahmadinejad was seen as the underdog and was not expected to make it into the runoff, but active campaigning by his supporters and their crossing of class barriers propelled him into the runoff and ultimately into the presidency. He had the political support of low-income workers, vigilante groups and militias while calling for a return to the ideals of the Islamic Revolution of 1979.

Ahmadinejad is a former commander in the Revolutionary Guard, former provincial governor of Maku and then Ardabil. As an ardent and loyal supporter of the ruling clerics and the Ayotollah &lt;a href="Ali%20Khamenei"&gt;Ali Khamenei&lt;/a&gt;, his appointment as mayor of Tehran by the city council surprised few.

Three &lt;a href="w%3ACamden%2C%20New%20Jersey"&gt;Camden, N.J.&lt;/a&gt; boys who had been missing since Wednesday June 22, were found dead by the father of one of the three in the trunk of a car. The car was located in the same yard where the boys were last seen. The 2-day search for them by their parents, police and volunteers took place in the Cramer Hill section of Camden, the city located across the &lt;a href="w%3ADelaware%20River"&gt;Delaware River&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3APhiladelphia%2C%20Pennsylvania"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;.

Several square miles of land around the Agosto home and even the river banks of the Delaware were searched for the three boys: Anibal "Juni" Cruz, 11; Daniel "Danny" Agosto, 6; and Jesstin "Manny" Pagan, 5. Many friends and relatives, as well as many people who had never met the boys, helped in the search.

However, on Friday June 24, an uncle of one of the boys and the father of the Agosto boy opened the trunk of a Toyota Camry parked in Cruz's yard. They were looking for &lt;a href="w%3AJump%20start"&gt;car battery jumper cables&lt;/a&gt; and discovered the boys' bodies. They had suffocated when the trunk lid dropped closed on them.

Television cameras captured the tragic discovery of the boys on film. David Agosto was so distraught he was taken away by paramedics on a stretcher. The TV coverage was on the scene because thousands of residents were to gather for a vigil for the missing children.

Investigators ruled out foul play, calling the incident a "tragic accident." Two of the boys, Cruz and Pagan, had learning and developmental disabilities. The car where the boys were discovered was reportedly not in running condition, and sat in the yard for more than a year.

The boys were trapped inside the trunk when temperatures were in the 80's &lt;a href="w%3Afarenheit"&gt;°F&lt;/a&gt;. The well insulated trunk compartment was a enough to suffocate them and muffle cries for help. There was also no inside release to the trunk that would allow for escape. 

The Camden County prosecutor has demanded an investigaton into why the boys were not found sooner.

<h1>Tom Cruise debates psychiatry on NBC's Today show</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Tom%20Cruise%20debates%20psychiatry%20on%20NBC%27s%20Today%20show&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Cruise's statements, including "&lt;a href="w%3APsychiatry"&gt;Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href="w%3Apseudoscience"&gt;pseudoscience&lt;/a&gt;", and "There is no such thing as a chemical imbalance in a body", reflect the beliefs of the &lt;a href="w%3AChurch%20of%20Scientology"&gt;Church of Scientology&lt;/a&gt;, of which he is a member. The interview became particularly tense when Lauer mentioned that he knew people who had been helped by taking &lt;a href="w%3AMethylphenidate"&gt;Ritalin&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="w%3Aattention-deficit%20hyperactivity%20disorder"&gt;attention-deficit disorder&lt;/a&gt; drug.

"Matt, Matt, you don't even — you're glib," Cruise responded. "You don't even know what Ritalin is. If you start talking about chemical imbalance, you have to evaluate and read the research papers on how they came up with these theories, Matt, OK. That's what I've done."

Cruise went on to say: "You don't know the history of psychiatry, I do."

Cruise has not formally studied medicine beyond a high school education, having dropped out in his senior year (1980) to pursue an acting career. In light of this, some members of the psychiatric community have refuted Cruise's controversial statements. Dr. John Scully, medical director of the American Psychiatric Association, has said "The illnesses we treat - anxiety, depression - are very real illnesses...The treatments work. We have demonstrated that through robust scientific study."

Lauer insisted that Ritalin helped people: "You're telling me what's worked for people I know or hasn't worked for people I know. I'm telling you, I've lived with these people and they're better," Lauer said.

Cruise hinted that Lauer was promoting Ritalin and Lauer scoffed: "I am not. I'm telling you in their cases, in their individual case, it worked."

The exchange ended when the two basically agreed to disagree. Cruise, who is 42, did admit that one of his goals is to speak more about Scientology in an effort to get people to understand it better.

Scientology has historically been at odds with the established medical and mental health community. The rift dates back to the 1950s and Scientology's founding father &lt;a href="w%3AL.%20Ron%20Hubbard"&gt;L. Ron Hubbard&lt;/a&gt;. In his book, "Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health", published in 1950, Hubbard claims that &lt;a href="w%3ADianetics"&gt;Dianetics&lt;/a&gt; (later called Scientology) could cure the majority of human ailments. These claims were sharply disputed by a variety of mainstream science and medical professionals including psychiatrists.

On Monday, June 27, 2005, the American Psychiatric Association released a statement that stated the following:
"It is irresponsible for Mr. Cruise to use his movie publicity tour to promote his own ideological views and deter people with mental illness from getting the care they need...Rigorous, published, peer-reviewed research clearly demonstrates that treatment (of mental illness) works...It is unfortunate that in the face of this remarkable scientific and clinical progress that a small number of individuals and groups persist in questioning its legitimacy."

The APA represents nearly 36,000 physicians specialising in the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness.

&lt;a href="w%3AGuidant"&gt;Guidant Corporation&lt;/a&gt; recently announced another safety warning on several models of its implantable &lt;a href="w%3ADefibrillator"&gt;defibrillators&lt;/a&gt;, cautioning users for the second time in a week about the devices. No patients are known to have been injured by the devices at this time. This brings the total number of defibrillator models recalled to twelve.

According to the Associated Press article, the five defibrillator models recalled "have a magnetic switch that can become stuck in a closed position, preventing the device from treating irregular heart rhythms. The faulty switch also can limit a defibrillator's battery life." 

After the announcement Friday, Guidant's stock dropped 6.9 percent, or $4.70, to $63.90.

<h1>Elections held in Bulgaria</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Elections%20held%20in%20Bulgaria&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Elections were held in &lt;a href="w%3ABulgaria"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt; for the 240 members of the Assembly today. According to exit polls, the Leftist Coalition for Bulgaria has a lead with around 31%, but without majority, neccesating creation of coalitions. The &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Movement%20for%20Simeon%20II"&gt;National Movement for Simeon II&lt;/a&gt; which is currently ruling is in the second place, with around 21%. The third is Ethnic Turks of Bulgaria, with around 11%.

It is expected that the National Movement for Simeon II will attempt to form a coalition with one of the lower placed parties in order to outnumber the Leftists.

At least 6,000 candidates (from 22 parties) ran for election to the 240 member parilament. The turnout of 52% was record lowest. 4% of the votes are needed to gain a seat.

The opposition Leftist Coalition, headed by &lt;a href="w%3ABulgarian%20Socialist%20Party"&gt;Bulgarian Socialist Party&lt;/a&gt; lead the election, but did not gain an outright majority. Sergei Stanishev, leader of the socialist party, stated he would attempt to form a governing coalition. "We won the confidence of the people ... We are ready to form a government ... and we will negotiate with any democratic party," Stanisheve said in a press conference.

In the last six free elections held since 1989, no government has been re-elected -- each has had to implement stringent economic and social reforms, since the fall of communism, and has lost popular support as a result.

Welsh poet &lt;a href="w%3ADannie%20Abse"&gt;Dannie Abse&lt;/a&gt; (81) and his wife Joan (78) were involved in a car crash while driving from &lt;a href="w%3AGolders%20Green"&gt;Golders Green&lt;/a&gt; to their holiday home in &lt;a href="w%3AOgmore-by-Sea"&gt;Ogmore-by-Sea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Wales"&gt;South Wales&lt;/a&gt;. Mrs. Abse died instantly; Mr Abse suffered a broken rib. The driver of the other vehicle was unhurt. The couple was returning from a poetry reading that they both had given.

Dannie Abse is an esteemed Jewish writer who lives in Glamorgan, South Wales. Joan Abse, his wife, was an art historian and writer. Dannie Abse is well-known for being a poet and a medical doctor. Abse, in fact, was a specialist at a chest clinic for over thirty years. But Abse is best known for his writings and has received numerous literary awards and fellowships. In 1989, he received an honorary doctorate from the Universities of Wales. 

The couple worked together editing two books in the 1980s.

Joan Abse leaves behind her husband, a son, and two daughters.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Nigeria%27s%20past%20rulers%20stole%20%24400%20billion%20in%20public%20money&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Figures have revealed that &lt;a href="w%3ANigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;'s past military dictators stole approximately $400 billion over the 39 years they were in power.

This amounts to nearly all of the aid given to Africa by the West over the same period.

Nigeria gained its independence from Britain in 1960 but was ruled by a succession of military leaders until democracy returned in 1999. In 2002, the Nigerian Economic and Financial Crimes Commission was set up to investigate corruption of past leaders.

Their figures showed that the military had squandered the public money on projects which did not help the country's citizens, and have left no lasting benefit.

The military siphoned the money off from sales of Nigerian oil - Nigeria is the world's eighth largest exporter of oil. Nigeria's last dictator, General &lt;a href="w%3ASani%20Abacha"&gt;Sani Abacha&lt;/a&gt;, may have stolen up to $6 billion, but only around $300 million has ever been recovered.

The chairman of the commission, Mallam Nuhu Ribadu described the military as having "institutionalised corruption", and of having undermined the public's desire to have efficient infrastructure in place.

"We are tired of giving ourselves bad names. Government must deliver on its promises. The moment we start doing things correctly, injustice will reduce, and corruption will also reduce. We need a leadership that is bold, strong and courageous," Ribadu said.

The &lt;a href="w%3AG8"&gt;G8&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="G8%20finance%20ministers%20agree%20on%20deal%20to%20relieve%20debts%20of%2018%20poorest%20nations"&gt;recently agreed to cancel the debt of 14 African nations to the IMF and the World Bank&lt;/a&gt; (a total of $40 billion), but excluded Nigeria on the grounds of corruption.

A professor at the &lt;a href="w%3ALagos"&gt;Lagos&lt;/a&gt; Business School, Prof Pat Utomi, said that was the right decision. "Who is to say you won't see the same behaviour again if it is all written off?"

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=U.S.%20Housing%20prices%20down%209%25%20since%20February&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The median house price in the United States plunged 6.5% in May to $217,000. In February of 2005, the median price of a home was $237,300.

♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Economist"&gt;The Economist&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ newspaper said in its June 16th issue; "In other words, it looks like the biggest bubble in history." by way of reference to what is happening with housing prices in the USA and much of Europe.

Japan provides an example of how a boom can turn to bust. Property prices have dropped for 14 years in a row (40% from their peak in 1991); and yet, the rise in prices in Japan during the decade before 1991 was less than the increase over the past ten years in most of today's "housing boom" countries.

The total value of residential property rose by more than $30 trillion over the past five years in developed economies, an increase equivalent to 100% of the combined GDPs of those countries. This increase dwarfs all previous house-price booms and is greater than the global stockmarket bubble in the late 1990s. Much of the recent housing activity is being driven by speculative demand. The &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Association%20of%20Realtors"&gt;National Association of Realtors&lt;/a&gt; (NAR) reported that 23% of all American houses bought in 2004 were for investment, not for owners to live in. Another 13% were bought as second homes. NAR also found that 42% of all first-time buyers made no down-payment on their home purchase last year.

Many investors are buying solely because they think prices will keep rising, which is a warning sign of a financial bubble. In Miami, Florida, as many as half of the original buyers resell new apartments even before they are built, and properties can change hands two or three times before somebody finally moves in.

Britain's &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Institution%20of%20Chartered%20Surveyors"&gt;Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors&lt;/a&gt; (RICS) reported prices have been falling for ten consecutive months. Forty nine percent of their surveyors reported falling prices in May. This was the weakest report since 1992 during Britain's previous house-price bust.

Maureen Faibish of &lt;a href="http%3A//maps.google.com/maps%3Fq%3D711%2BLincoln%2BWay%2BSan%2BFrancisco%2C%2BCA%26amp%3Bspn%3D0.022357%2C0.039139%26amp%3Bhl%3Den"&gt;711 Lincoln Way&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco%2C%20CA"&gt;San Francisco, CA&lt;/a&gt; was arrested on June 24, 2005 on the charge of &lt;a href="w%3Achild%20endangerment"&gt;child endangerment&lt;/a&gt; in the actions leading up to the death of her son, 12-year-old Nicholas Faibish, who was mauled by one or both of her two &lt;a href="w%3Apit%20bull"&gt;pit bull&lt;/a&gt; dogs, Rex 2 and Ella. 

Nicholas was discovered dead in the front bedroom of her home at approximately 15:15 PDT on June 3, 2005, by his mother, who had left the house to run some errands. She had locked her son in the basement to keep him away from the dogs. "I put him down there, with a shovel on the door.", Faibish said in a telephone interview to the San Francisco Chronicle. "He had a bunch of food. And I told him, 'Stay down there until I come back.' Typical Nicky, he wouldn't listen to me."

Faibish stated that she believes that her son had walked in when Rex 2, a male pit bull, was attempting to mate with Ella, a female pit bull who was in heat at the time. She stated that Rex 2 had been acting possessively prior to the incident. A police officer shot and killed Ella in order to gain entry to the apartment. Rex 2 was captured and removed to an animal shelter. "The police killed the wrong dog if you ask me.", Faibish said.

British television host &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Whiteley"&gt;Richard Whiteley&lt;/a&gt;, most famous for his role presenting the British television game show ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACountdown%20%28game%20show%29"&gt;Countdown&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, has died aged 61 at Leeds General Infirmary. 

The cause of death is reported to have been complications resulting from an operation on his heart to repair an infected valve. He had been admitted to Bradford Royal Infirmary with &lt;a href="w%3APneumonia"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt; on May 6, falling into a coma shortly there after.

His 23 years of hosting ♡❤Countdown♡❤ made him a household name among television viewers in the UK, having previously anchored Yorkshire's ♡❤Calendar♡❤ local affairs program. The avuncular figure was fond of word play and possessed a striking wit.

Until this May, Whiteley had never missed presenting an edition of the show. Countdown was the first programme to be broadcast on the new &lt;a href="w%3AChannel%204"&gt;Channel 4&lt;/a&gt; when it began broadcasting in 1982. 

He was awarded an &lt;a href="w%3AOrder%20of%20the%20British%20Empire"&gt;OBE&lt;/a&gt; in June 2004.

Whiteley leaves behind a partner of 11 years, actress &lt;a href="w%3AKathryn%20Apanowicz"&gt;Kathryn Apanowicz&lt;/a&gt;.

Two &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Marine%20Corps"&gt;U.S. marines&lt;/a&gt; were recently cleared of charges in the brutal assault of an &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n youth in a Townsville nightclub February 2004. The alleged assault occurred within Australian jurisdiction, however permission was given by the victim and Attorney-general &lt;a href="w%3APhillip%20Ruddock"&gt;Phillip Ruddock&lt;/a&gt; for the matter to be transferred to a military court in the US. 

"I've asked for a full report on the matter," Mr Ruddock said. 

Heath Twomey, a student in Townsville, had his throat cut during the assault. He wasn't asked to give evidence in the court, and only found out about the acquittal through the media. His father said that Heath had been forever changed by the incident. 

"He was assaulted by being hit with a bottle, he had his throat slashed, it nearly penetrated the jugular vein," he said.

Mr Twomey claimed that his son was pressured by US officials to accept the transfer of jurisdiction. He says that his son was led to believe that the penalty would be more severe. 

"It's such a foreign outcome compared to what would normally ensue within the Queensland justice system," he said. 

Ruddock is investigating the matter, and has asked for a full report from the US &lt;a href="w%3AJudge%20Advocate%20General"&gt;Judge Advocate General&lt;/a&gt;, who prosecutes all military cases. 

"I want to know whether or not [justice has been done], I want that matter tested," he said. 

The US Embassy referred inquiries to the JAG office. They have been approached by ♡❤The World Today♡❤, but are yet to comment.

The &lt;a href="w%3ASupreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;United States Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; has ruled that "non-neutral" displays of the &lt;a href="w%3ATen%20Commandments"&gt;Ten Commandments&lt;/a&gt; in courtrooms violate the &lt;a href="w%3AFirst%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution"&gt;U.S. Constitution's First Amendment&lt;/a&gt; guarantee of religious neutrality, but that "historical" displays are permitted.

In the case &lt;a href="w%3AMcCreary%20County%20v.%20ACLU%20of%20Kentucky"&gt;McCreary County v. ACLU of Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;, the court ruled that the display of the Commandments in Kentucky county courthouses constituted an unconstitutional endorsement of religion. However, in the case &lt;a href="w%3AVan%20Orden%20v.%20Perry"&gt;Van Orden v. Perry&lt;/a&gt; heard at the same time, the court permitted the display of the Commandments in a monument at the Texas state capitol.

In the Texas case, &lt;a href="w%3AWilliam%20Rehnquist"&gt;Chief Justice William Rehnquist&lt;/a&gt;, writing for the majority, wrote that:

However, in the Kentucky decision, the Court ruled that the history of the Ten Commandments' display in the courthouse was evidence of religious (and not historical) intention and that the reasoning given in legislative resolutions was not reflective of the counties' actual intentions in their displays. Justice Souter wrote for the majority, drawing specific attention to the character of the display:

Proponents of displaying the Commandments hold that they represent the bedrock of Western legal tradition. Opponents hold that the ancient Biblical rules, which begin ♡❤I am the Lord thy God♡❤, represent religious dogma, not law.

A former &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;i soldier has been convicted by an Israeli court of the manslaughter of a &lt;a href="w%3ABritain"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; student who was acting as a human shield in the Gaza Strip in April 2003.

Ex-sergeant Wahid Taysir, serving with the Beduin Unit in Rafah, hit &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Hurndall"&gt;Tom Hurndall&lt;/a&gt; with a single shot to the head from an army watchtower, using a sniper rifle with a telescopic sight. Hurndall had been guiding children away from an area of shooting in the Palestinian town of Rafah.

Twenty-two year old Hurndall fell into a coma and died of his injuries nine months later in a London hospital. Taysir's defence lawyers had tried to claim during the trial that Hurndall's death was due to malpractice by British doctors.

The Israeli army had initially declined to carry out an investigation into the shooting. After the British government started their own enquiry and cited Taysir as having fired the fatal shot, the Israeli army made the decision to prosecute Taysir, who is no longer serving in the army.

The verdict took more than an hour to read out in a small courtroom in southern Israel. As well as being found guilty of manslaughter, Taysir was found guilty of obtaining false testimony, submitting false testimony, obstruction of justice, and improper conduct.

Taysir's sentence will be decided next week. Another soldier was also jailed for lying to protect Taysir.

Hurndall's father Anthony was one of 50 people in the courtroom. Afterwards he welcomed the verdict, but claimed that the Israeli army acted with impunity too often. The Israeli government insist that there is no policy that tolerates shooting civilians.

Taysir is an Israeli &lt;a href="w%3ABedouin"&gt;Beduin&lt;/a&gt; Arab. He served in the Israeli army as a volunteer.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Supreme%20Court"&gt;U.S. Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; today ruled that Internet file sharing networks can be sued for copyright infringement. The decision in the case "&lt;a href="w%3AMGM%20Studios%2C%20Inc.%20v.%20Grokster%2C%20Ltd."&gt;Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. et al. v. Grokster, Ltd. et al.&lt;/a&gt;" had been much awaited by those on both sides of the debate about copyright law and its application to Internet technologies. The court ruled that businesses created with the purpose of letting users commit copyright violations should be held liable for the infringement.

Writing for the court, Justice &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Souter"&gt;David Souter&lt;/a&gt; wrote: "One who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright, as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement, going beyond mere distribution with knowledge of third-party action, is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties using the device, regardless of the device's lawful uses."

The strength of the decision was unexpected &amp;mdash; this is the first major Internet copyright case to reach the Supreme Court in many years, and the Justices' unanimity sends a strong message about their lack of tolerance for companies designed to violate the law.

The decision affects such companies as &lt;a href="w%3AGrokster"&gt;Grokster&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMorpheus%20%28computer%20program%29"&gt;StreamCast&lt;/a&gt;, both of which were &lt;a href="w%3Adefendant"&gt;defendant&lt;/a&gt;s in this suit. The court's ruling does not have an immediate effect, however, as the Justices referred the decisions to a lower court to be reconsidered.

Fred von Lohmann, senior staff attorney for the &lt;a href="w%3AElectronic%20Freedom%20Foundation"&gt;EFF&lt;/a&gt;, panned the court for not providing a clear test for what constitutes inducement, saying it would discourage innovators unsure of their project's legality. He did however remain optimistic about Grokster and StreamCast's chances in the lower courts.

&lt;a href="w%3AAmerican"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; actor &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Fiedler"&gt;John Fiedler&lt;/a&gt; died at the age of 80 on June 25. Though he worked extensively on stage, film, television, and radio for over forty years, he is perhaps most remembered for two roles: the mild, fearful voice of &lt;a href="w%3APiglet"&gt;Piglet&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ADisney"&gt;Disney&lt;/a&gt;'s many &lt;a href="w%3AWinnie%20the%20Pooh"&gt;Winnie the Pooh&lt;/a&gt; productions, and the role of Mr. Peterson, nervous patient on ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Bob%20Newhart%20Show"&gt;The Bob Newhart Show&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. 

Born in 1925 in &lt;a href="w%3AOhio"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, Fiedler began his career in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20%28state%29"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, working on the radio series ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Aldrich%20Family"&gt;The Aldrich Family&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ as sidekick Homer Brown, and making his film debut in ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ATwelve%20Angry%20Men"&gt;Twelve Angry Men&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ (1957), as the nervous Juror #2. Most of his subsequent roles were as gentle or nervous types, though occasionally he broke out of the mold, notably in the original ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AStar%20Trek"&gt;Star Trek&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ episode "A Wolf in the Fold," as an official possessed by &lt;a href="w%3AJack%20the%20Ripper"&gt;Jack the Ripper&lt;/a&gt;. On Broadway he was in the original casts of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AA%20Raisin%20in%20the%20Sun"&gt;A Raisin in the Sun&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ (as housing commmittee rep Lindner) and ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Odd%20Couple"&gt;The Odd Couple&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ (as poker player Vinnie), reprising both roles for the film versions. Other on-camera work included roles in the films ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ATrue%20Grit"&gt;True Grit&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Cannonball%20Run"&gt;The Cannonball Run&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, plus many TV guest spots from ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABewitched"&gt;Bewitched&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Twilight%20Zone"&gt;The Twilight Zone&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, and a recurring part on ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AKolchak%3A%20The%20Night%20Stalker"&gt;Kolchak: The Night Stalker&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ as morgue attendant Gordy "The Ghoul" Spangler.

His distinctive voice kept him busiest, however. In addition to playing Piglet in many shorts, four features, several specials, and two TV series, he was heard in the Disney features ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Rescuers"&gt;The Rescuers&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ARobin%20Hood%20%281973%20movie%29"&gt;Robin Hood&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, and ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Emperor%27s%20New%20Groove"&gt;The Emporer's New Groove&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. A cause of death has not yet been reported.

The &lt;a href="Moscow"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt; District Prosecutor's Office has dropped its investigation of &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJudaism"&gt;Jewry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on charges of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aracist"&gt;racist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; incitement and distribution of anti-Russian material for having published an abridged translation of a 16th Century &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHebrew%20language"&gt;Hebrew&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; text on &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ahalakha"&gt;Jewish law&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Jewish leaders were summoned for questioning about the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AShulkhan%20Arukh"&gt;Kitzur Shulkhan Arukh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as the apparent first step of a probe into whether all Jewish organizations should be banned in Russia.

Disbanding all Jewish organizations in Russia was requested in a January 13, 2005 letter to the State Prosecutor General signed by 20 members of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARussian%20State%20Duma"&gt;Russian State Duma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The letter was expanded into a petition signed by 500 well-known public figures, church officials and army generals in March. After being published in a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Petersburg"&gt;St. Petersburg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; newspaper, the petition gleaned 5,000 signatures. It called the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ajudaism"&gt;Jewish religion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; anti-&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChristianity"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and inhumane, and even practicing &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aritual%20murder"&gt;ritual murder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of Christian children &lt;a href="http%3A//www.ncsj.org/AuxPages/032105RusPrav_trans.shtml"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Excerpts in English].

Although the Russian Foreign Ministry had condemned the letter, the St. Petersburg District Prosecutor's Office declared that it was not &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAnti-Semitism"&gt;anti-Semitic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and declined to file incitement charges against &lt;a href="http%3A//www.rusprav.ru/"&gt;Rus Pravoslavnaya&lt;/a&gt;, the newspaper that published it.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AS%C3%A3o%20Paulo%2C%20Brazil"&gt;São Paulo, Brazil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — Several witnesses are denouncing the government of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and the ruling &lt;a href="w%3AWorkers%27%20Party%20%28Brazil%29"&gt;Workers' Party&lt;/a&gt; (PT). Below are some of the main denunciations and witnesses.

In May, the Brazilian deputy &lt;a href="w%3ARoberto%20Jefferson"&gt;Roberto Jefferson&lt;/a&gt; was involved in an alleged corruption scheme that involved the Brazilian Postal Service. Jefferson said that he was unfairly being abandoned and sacrificed. In addition he said that he would not take the fall alone. 

On June 6, Roberto Jefferson told the Brazilian newspaper Folha de São Paulo that the ruling
&lt;a href="w%3AWorkers%27%20Party%20%28Brazil%29"&gt;Workers' Party&lt;/a&gt; (PT) has been paying Brazilian deputies 30 thousand Brazilian Reais (USD 12 thousand) each, every month, in return for support. Jefferson later confirmed to a Congressional special commission what he had previously stated to the newspaper. Also he added that he had informed the Minister José Dirceu about the payments and that no action was taken. Dirceu denied Jefferson's allegations.

According to Jefferson the payments only stopped after he informed the President &lt;a href="w%3ALuiz%20In%C3%A1cio%20Lula%20da%20Silva"&gt;Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva&lt;/a&gt;. He also said that the Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9%20Dirceu"&gt;José Dirceu&lt;/a&gt; should leave the government, otherwise President Lula would get involved. Two days later, the Minister José Dirceu announced his resignation from his post.

Jefferson denied involvement in the Brazilian Postal Service scandal. Jefferson told the commission that the &lt;a href="w%3AAg%C3%AAncia%20Brasileira%20de%20Intelig%C3%AAncia"&gt;Brazilian Agency of Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; (Abin) was controlled by the former Brazilian Minister of Civil Affairs &lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9%20Dirceu"&gt;José Dirceu&lt;/a&gt; and it recorded the tape which shows the former Brazilian Postal Service Chief Maurício Marinho during a supposed bribery negotiation with a businessman.

However Jefferson admitted that he received R$ 4 million from the Workers' Party (PT). According to Jefferson, during a meeting with him and the PTB treasurer Émerson Palmieri, the Workers' Party treasurer Delúbio Soares and the Workers' Party President José Genoíno, they decided that PTB should received R$ 20 million. Jefferson said he received only R$ 4 million and the money was delivered by the businessman Marcos Valério Fernandes de Souza, owner of publicity enterprises. 

On June 14, Fernanda Karina Ramos Somaggio denounced his former boss Marcos Valério and told the Brazilian magazine "IstoÉ - Dinheiro" that she saw suitcases full of money leaving the enterprise during the time she worked for him as secretary (&lt;a href="http%3A//www.terra.com.br/istoedinheiro/406/economia/testemunha_01.htm"&gt;IstoÉ article&lt;/a&gt;). Also she said that Marcos Valério encountered Workers' Party members several times, including Delúbio Soares. On June 15, the secretary denied everything what she said to "IstoÉ - Dinheiro" to police. However, on June 20, Karina Somaggio said that she lied to the police because she and her family were threatened. In a new testimony to the Brazilian police, Karina Somaggio confirmed the interview to the magazine and the accusations against her former boss, Marcos Valério. Karina Somaggio is now under police protection. 

Marcos Valério denied the allegations of Karina Somaggio. He has initiated court proceedings against his former secretary.

Some days later the magazine "IstoÉ" revealed documents from the Council for Control of Financial Activities (Coaf). According to the documents around R$ 20.9 millions left SMP&amp;B and DNA enterprises, which belong to Marcos Valério (&lt;a href="http%3A//www.terra.com.br/istoe/1863/brasil/1863_aparece_o_dinheiro.htm"&gt;IstoÉ article&lt;/a&gt;). The Coaf is a Brazilian public agency which monitors irregular financial activities. The enterprises of Marcos Valério have millionaire contracts with the Brazilian government.
On June 21 and 22, parliamentarians listened to the former Brazilian Postal Service Chief Maurício Marinho, accused of involvement in the Brazilian Postal Service scandal. At first Marinho refused talking about any illegality in the Brazilian Postal Service. However, on June 22, after his lawyers admitted that he was not telling the whole truth and that they would leave him, Marinho demanded protection for himself and his family, then started to talk. He said the Workers’ Party general-secretary Sílvio Pereira and the Minister Luiz Gushiken had some influence in the Brazilian Postal Service. He said that the biggest Brazilian Postal Service contracts should be investigated and he mentioned big contracts to the Brazilian bank Bradesco.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AS%C3%A3o%20Paulo%2C%20Brazil"&gt;São Paulo, Brazil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
The President of Brazil, &lt;a href="Luiz%20In%C3%A1cio%20Lula%20da%20Silva"&gt;Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva&lt;/a&gt; is facing a serious political crisis in his government. There are a lot of denounciations involving important figures of his party, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWorkers%27%20Party%20%28Brazil%29"&gt;Workers’ Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (PT). 

In an attempt to save his government, Lula is negotiating an alliance with the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AParty%20of%20the%20Brazilian%20Democratic%20Movement"&gt;Party of the Brazilian Democratic Movement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (PMDB). Lula said that he will reform his ministry and it is expected that some politicians of the PMDB become ministers.
There is not a general consensus about this alliance. Some governors and parliamentarians of PMDB are against it. 

The President of PMDB, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMichel%20Temer"&gt;Michel Temer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , said that he will listen to his colleagues before taking a decision.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AS%C3%A3o%20Paulo%2C%20Brazil"&gt;São Paulo, Brazil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — Representatives of the &lt;a href="w%3ALandless%20Workers%27%20Movement"&gt;Landless Workers' Movement&lt;/a&gt; (MST) and other social movements linked to the &lt;a href="w%3AWorkers%27%20Party"&gt;Workers' Party&lt;/a&gt; (PT) had a meeting with the Brazilian President &lt;a href="w%3ALuiz%20In%C3%A1cio%20Lula%20da%20Silva"&gt;Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva&lt;/a&gt; on June 22. 

They said that they defend the investigation of corruption schemes, however they said that the Lula government is the victim of a destabilization campaign. They blame the President of the United States &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; for the crisis. They say that the government of Lula is victim of a &lt;a href="w%3ACoup%20d%27%C3%A9tat"&gt;coup&lt;/a&gt; attempt by Bush supporters.

Senator Heloísa Helena from the &lt;a href="w%3ASocialism%20and%20Freedom%20Party"&gt;Socialism and Freedom Party&lt;/a&gt; (PSOL) said that the coup idea is nonsense. Other parliamentarians, even some of the Workers' Party, didn't agree with the coup argument. Some senators said that only the Wokers' Party itself initiated the crisis. Some senators who do not belong to the Brazilian ruling party PT warned of a scenario like the one in &lt;a href="w%3AVenezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt; where the President &lt;a href="w%3AHugo%20Ch%C3%A1vez"&gt;Hugo Chávez&lt;/a&gt; concentrated all political power on his hands using the support of social movements.

Dr. Lester Friedlander, a former &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Agriculture"&gt;United States Department of Agriculture&lt;/a&gt; (USDA) vet, had been blowing the whistle on the USDA beef inspection practices before the latest case of &lt;a href="w%3Abovine%20spongiform%20encephalopathy"&gt;bovine spongiform encephalopathy&lt;/a&gt; (BSE) was confirmed. Dr. Friedlander said that inspectors are allowed only 15 seconds of inspection and that unhygienic practices are common in the meat industry; practices such as cow carcasses with abscesses being hosed off, wrapped up and shipped to the consumer.

Friedlander also claims that some supervisors were more concerned about falsifying inspection documents than protecting consumers and that on June 9, 2005, a cow in Texas with BSE symptoms was sent straight to the rendering plant without testing.
There have also been allegations of a "don't ask,don't tell" approach being applied by US health officials when confronted with human deaths which may be caused by eating BSE contaminated meat.
The Organic Consumers Association reported last year that hundreds of people are dying in the US each year from &lt;a href="w%3ACreutzfeldt-Jakob%20disease"&gt;Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease&lt;/a&gt; (CJD or vCJD) (the human counterpart of BSE) and the deaths are being written off as "unexplainable". The disease causes holes in the brains of the victims.

A New Jersey lawyer, Janet Skarbek is being called "the next Erin Brockovich" for her research into the "Cherry Hill cluster" of 12 deaths she said were caused by people eating BSE infected meat; "I'm up to 12 confirmed cases of CJD, where it says CJD on their death certificates and where they all ate at the same racetrack," Skarbek said.

New Jersey state officials have said that the 12 deaths did not result from the human form of mad cow disease, but rather from sporadic CJD; but Skarbek says the government's numbers don't add up. "If you just take five of the victims from New Jersey that ate at the track most recently, two were out of 100 administrative employees and three were out of 1,000 season-pass holders. So out of that population of 1,100 people, we should see one case of CJD every 909 years."

A recent survey conducted by the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Cancer%20Society"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt; has turned up some surprising results: Americans generally hold false beliefs about the nature of &lt;a href="w%3Acancer"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; and its treatment, even though many believe they are well informed.

Health experts say this ignorance could be dangerous: People may be making poor health decisions -- avoiding cancer screenings or rejecting potentially life-saving treatments -- based on their incorrect notions.

The most common misconception is that surgery causes cancer to spread. Decades ago, cancer often was not discovered until it was very advanced. At that stage, surgical efforts were rarely successful, and many patients died soon after procedures were performed. This may have given rise to the mistaken belief that the surgeries caused the disease to worsen.

Another commonly held myth is that there is a cure for cancer, but the medical industry is withholding it in order to continue profiting from the sale of less effective treatments and medications.

Believers in this "&lt;a href="w%3Aconspiracy%20theory"&gt;conspiracy theory&lt;/a&gt;" may not be guided by it in making their personal health decisions, though. The American Cancer Society says that even though many people are suspicious of the medical industry in general, they have a trusting relationship with their own physicians and are likely to follow their advice.

Almost 20 percent of the people surveyed felt that medications for cancer pain were ineffective.

About 10 percent expressed the belief that cancer could be cured with a positive attitude alone, while a similar number felt that there was no effective treatment for cancer.

The fact is, cancer survival and treatments -- including pain management -- have vastly improved in the last thirty years.

Results of the survey appear in the August 1 issue of Cancer, a journal published by the American Cancer Society.

Russian Foreign Minister &lt;a href="w%3ASergei%20Lavrov"&gt;Sergei Lavrov&lt;/a&gt; told RIA Novosti during a visit to &lt;a href="w%3AHelsinki"&gt;Helsinki&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;a href="w%3ARussian%20Federation"&gt;Russian Federation&lt;/a&gt; had decided to revoke its signature from the border agreements it signed with the &lt;a href="w%3AEstonian"&gt;Estonian&lt;/a&gt; government in &lt;a href="w%3AMoscow"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt; on May 18.

The move comes just one week after the Estonian &lt;a href="w%3ARiigikogu"&gt;Riigikogu&lt;/a&gt; ratified the border document which slightly amends the border that has been used since Estonia regained its independence from the &lt;a href="w%3ASoviet%20Union"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; in 1991.

A source inside the Russian Foreign Ministry told &lt;a href="w%3AItar-Tass"&gt;Itar-Tass&lt;/a&gt; that the preamble to the document as ratified by the Estonian parliament was "unacceptable" because it mentioned the Tartu Peace Treaty of 1920, by which the Russian Socialist Federal Republic recognized the independent statehood of Estonia.

Alexander Yakovenko, a spokesperson for the Russian foreign ministry told Gateway 2 Russia, another Russian news wire, that this set up a situation where Estonia could claim land from Russia. Estonia lost 5 percent of its territory to Russia when authorities delineated the Estonian Soviet Federal Republic from the Russian Soviet Federal Republic in 1945.

However, the Estonian Foreign Ministry has reiterated its stance that the border treaty seals the border with Russia, and the preamble makes no claims to Russian territory. 

"The Estonian side has repeatedly assured that it has not linked any new issues to the border treaties, and thus, the Russian side's assertion that Estonia has added new aspects to the treaty is ungrounded," the foreign ministry said in a statement.

Estonian and Russian officials first agreed upon the border treaty in 1996, and then initialed them in 1999, according to the website of the Estonian Foreign Ministry. The preamble included with the treaty signed in May stated that the agreement would have no impact on other issues concerning Estonian-Russian bilateral relations and &lt;a href="w%3AUrmas%20Paet"&gt;Urmas Paet&lt;/a&gt;, the Estonian foreign minister said in a statement on June 27 that Estonia has no land claims to Russia.

"Russia does not have the will to normalize relations with Estonia and, I would say, even with the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt;," explained Marko Mihkelson, the deputy chairman of the Estonian foreign relations commission in a statement. 

"This is because here, indeed, we are talking about Estonian-Russian border, which is not only a border between the two states but also a border between the European Union and Russia," he said.

Estonia is now urging Russia to reconsider its stance, while Lavrov told reporters in Helsinki that the two parties will have to start from scratch.

&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20T.%20Walton"&gt;John Walton&lt;/a&gt;, son of &lt;a href="w%3AWal-Mart"&gt;Wal-Mart&lt;/a&gt; founder &lt;a href="w%3ASam%20Walton"&gt;Sam Walton&lt;/a&gt; and the 11th richest person in the world, has been killed in a plane crash on June 27 in &lt;a href="w%3AWyoming"&gt;Wyoming&lt;/a&gt;. He was 58 years old. The crash occurred shortly after takeoff from &lt;a href="w%3AJackson%20Hole%20Airport"&gt;Jackson Hole Airport&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AGrand%20Teton%20National%20Park"&gt;Grand Teton National Park&lt;/a&gt; at about 1:20 p.m. CDT. Walton was the only person killed in the crash.
&lt;p&gt;
"We're sad that John Walton, who was well-known and much-loved in this valley, died doing something that he loved to do, which was fly aircraft," said Joan Anzelmo, a spokeswoman for Grand Teton National Park.
&lt;p&gt;
Walton was killed while flying an experimental ultra-light aircraft with small gasoline engine and wings made of material similar to sail-cloth.
&lt;p&gt;
Because the aircraft was unregistered and experimental, officials at the National Park indicate that there will not be an &lt;a href="w%3ANTSB"&gt;NTSB&lt;/a&gt; investigation. Officials at Grand Teton National Park will, however, conduct their own internal investigation.
&lt;p&gt;
Walton was named to the board of directors of Wal-Mart in 1992 -- he never worked for the company. He had served as a &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Beret"&gt;Green Beret&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href="w%3AVietnam%20War"&gt;Vietnam War&lt;/a&gt; and was awarded the Silver Star for saving the lives of several members of his unit while under fire. Walton was involved in several business interests over the years, including crop-dusting and boat construction.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AS%C3%A3o%20Paulo%2C%20Brazil"&gt;São Paulo, Brazil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — The government of the Brazilian President &lt;a href="w%3ALuiz%20In%C3%A1cio%20Lula%20da%20Silva"&gt;Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva&lt;/a&gt; and his party, the &lt;a href="w%3AWorkers%27%20Party%20%28Brazil%29"&gt;Workers' Party&lt;/a&gt; are the target of several serious accusations of corruption.

This is the most severe political crisis since Brazilians first attained their right to vote for a President in &lt;a href="w%3A1989"&gt;1989&lt;/a&gt;, the former President &lt;a href="w%3AFernando%20Collor%20de%20Mello"&gt;Fernando Collor de Mello&lt;/a&gt; was elected.

The ruling Workers' Party has not succeeded in its defense against the accusations. The Brazilian deputy &lt;a href="w%3ARoberto%20Jefferson"&gt;Roberto Jefferson&lt;/a&gt; said that the ruling party bought the support of some Brazilian deputies, paying 30 thousand Brazilian Reals (US$ 12 thousand) each, every month. Although Jefferson said that he had no proof of this, he gave a very detailed description of the alleged corruption scheme.

The testimonies of other witnesses and the investigation that is being made by police gave support for some of the Jefferson's claims. Independent investigation being made by newspapers and magazines, and the publication of documents and other evidences, expose the government and Workers' Party more and more.

Popular support for the President is deteriorating. Except for the Workers' Party and the &lt;a href="w%3ACommunist%20Party%20of%20Brazil"&gt;Communist Party of Brazil&lt;/a&gt; (PCdoB) which are part of the government, there is not another political party in Brazil denying the accusations. All newspapers and magazines publish stories every day related to the scandal. The Workers' Party itself is divided: some members believe that the accusations are true and that something went wrong, others prefer to deny the evidences and they argue that the party is innocent.

A great part of the work of the Brazilian parliamentarians is related to the investigation of the scandals. Besides the Votes-for-cash scandal dennounced by Jefferson, there are 
the Bingo's scandal, the Post Office scandal and the Brazilian Reinsurance Institute (IRB) scandal. All of these scandals are being submited to investigation by Brazilian parliamentarians.

One important question is whether President Lula knew about the alleged scandals in his government or not. If he knew and he did nothing he was conniving or he participated, it is the worst. If he didn't know, someone can say that he was very incompetent because he didn't see something so big under his nose.

Today, the authority and the efficiency of the President is being questioned. Some people say that it was the former Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9%20Dirceu"&gt;José Dirceu&lt;/a&gt; who actually took great part of the decisions in Lula's government. The politicians say that President Lula must take control of his government, that he should do a major reform of his government and that he should get away from the people who are involved in the scandals.

Besides the corruption dennounciations, the government of President Lula is being criticized by his weak social agenda. The programme called "Zero Hunger" has showed little results and many people accuse it of being just a marketing strategy.

The management of the economy has being praised by some analysts. However, critics, even inside the government like the Vice-President &lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9%20Alencar"&gt;José Alencar&lt;/a&gt; have already criticized it, because of the high interest rates. There is not severe inflation, but unemployment is high, and salaries are low.

The next days or the next month may be decisive to the future of Lula. He must show that he is not involved in the corruption scandals, he must reform the government and he must prove that he is competent. The positive factor are that the Brazilian economy is not seriously contaminated by the political crisis until now, the population is perplexed but calm and the politicians are not envolving the President in the denunciations, although they demand the investigation of all corruption allegations. However, nobody knows how much this situation will remain or if it will remain until the end of the government of President Lula in 2006.

In accordance with the &lt;a href="w%3ATreaty%20on%20Open%20Skies"&gt;Treaty on Open Skies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANorway"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ADenmark"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt; started conducting observation flights over &lt;a href="w%3ABelarus"&gt;Belarus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; yesterday. These flights are expected to last until July 1, with seven Belarusian and two Russian inspectors monitoring foreign planes. 

The treaty establishes a program of unarmed aerial surveillance flights over the entire territory of its 34 state participants. The treaty is designed to enhance mutual understanding and confidence by giving all participants, regardless of size, a direct role in gathering information about military forces and activities of concern to them. Russia and Belarus signed the treaty in 1992 in &lt;a href="w%3AHelsinki"&gt;Helsinki&lt;/a&gt;. 

According to the spokesman of Belarusian Ministry of Defense, Russia and Belarus have finished their analogous flight over the &lt;a href="w%3AUSA"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt; on June 25.

The President of &lt;a href="Belarus"&gt;Belarus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Alexander%20Lukashenko"&gt;Alexander Lukashenko&lt;/a&gt;, accused foreign funds and donators of ideological expansion in Belarus during his meeting with talented youth today.

"In recent years, activities of foreign donators, who were carrying out ideological expansion on Belarus disguised as humanitarian aid, and really stealing State's intellectual possession, was curbed," Lukashenko said.

Students, which Lukashenko met, were receivers of Belarusian presidential stipendies. He said, that the idea of domestic funds was created "in uneasy times" to keep talented students in Belarus.

Lukashenko requested last year that each trip abroad for sake of education be limited.

<h1>France secures site for 10 billion euro nuclear fusion research project</h1>

The European Union has won a years-long battle to host &lt;a href="w%3AITER"&gt;ITER&lt;/a&gt;, the 'next step' in &lt;a href="w%3Anuclear%20fusion"&gt;nuclear fusion&lt;/a&gt; research. Nuclear fusion is the process that powers our sun, and could potentially lead to &lt;a href="w%3AFusion%20power"&gt;almost unlimited energy&lt;/a&gt; available on Earth.

The six partners in the international project &amp;mdash; the European Union (through its suborganization EURATOM), the People's Republic of China, Japan, South Korea, Russia and the United States - declared today in Moscow that the device will be constructed at Cadarache, in France. The other contender for the project was Japan. 

Japan and the EU (as well as Canada until 2003) had fought a long and hard battle to secure the site of the experiment, seen as the next step towards nuclear fusion, until Japan finally withdrew its bid today.

Under the terms of the agreement, the EU will pay 50% of the construction costs of the 10 billion euro (£6.6bn) program costs, while Japan will gain 20% of the 200 research jobs that will be part of the project, but pay only 10% of the costs.

"We believe that the ITER project should start as soon as possible for the sake of mankind's future," said Nariaki Nakayama, Japan's science minister.

Professor Sir Chris Llewellyn Smith, head of the of UK Atomic Energy Authority's (UKAEA) Culham division, responsible for the UK's thermonuclear fusion programme, said that "rapid construction of ITER will be a major step in the development of fusion as a potential large-scale source of electricity that will not contribute to climate change."

French environmental groups have shown dismay at the news of the siting decision. Mediane, one such group, said "We are against the project because it's very dangerous and will not create jobs in the region." A group of several French environmental groups, Sortir du Nucleaire (Get Out of Nuclear Energy), said ITER was dangerous as scientists did not know "how to manipulate the high-energy &lt;a href="w%3Adeuterium"&gt;deuterium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Atritium"&gt;tritium&lt;/a&gt; hydrogen isotopes used in the fusion process. ITER will never produce electricity. Maybe, well after ITER, another reactor in 100, 150 or 200 years will do so &amp;mdash; but that's far from certain."

The JET nuclear fusion project in the UK has operated for twenty years and has used tritium for ten; it has a 100% safety record with no radiation ever being released.

ITER will follow on from the work of such experiments as the European &lt;a href="w%3AJoint%20Europe%20Torus"&gt;JET&lt;/a&gt;, the Japanese &lt;a href="w%3AJT-60u"&gt;JT-60u&lt;/a&gt;, and the American TFTR and DIII-D. It is not designed to produce electricity, but to research technologies that will allow a prototype nuclear fusion power plant &amp;mdash; 'DEMO' &amp;mdash; to begin construction in around 2030. The ITER program itself will last for thirty years &amp;mdash; ten for construction, and at least 20 years of operation.

Nuclear fusion works by forcing the atomic nuclei &amp;mdash; in this case isotopes of hydrogen, namely deuterium and/or tritium &amp;mdash; to combine under great heat and pressure. The products of the reaction have a lower mass than the original reactants &amp;mdash; releasing energy according to Einstein's famous equation of formula_1.

The fuel is derived from sea water, meaning that fusion is an almost limitless source of energy.

Nuclear fusion produces no waste products other than helium, and does not contribute to global warming in any way. Little radiation is produced by the reaction; a nuclear fusion power plant will take less than 100 years to become completely safe after decommissioning. Furthermore, fusion reactors have very little fuel inside them at any one moment &amp;mdash; so therefore no chance of a 'meltdown' &amp;mdash; and can shut down in seconds if the fuel supply is cut off.

<h1>Civilians testify to Halliburton fraud, coercion</h1>
♡❤♡, ♡❤♡ 

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; held a public committee, aired on &lt;a href="w%3AC-Span"&gt;C-SPAN 3&lt;/a&gt;, at which former civilian employees based in or administering operations in Iraq, testified to specific instances of waste, fraud, and other abuses and irregularities by &lt;a href="w%3AHalliburton"&gt;Halliburton&lt;/a&gt; and its subsidiary &lt;a href="w%3AKellogg%2C%20Brown%20and%20Root"&gt;Kellogg, Brown and Root&lt;/a&gt; (KBR). 

Allegations of fraud by Halliburton, specifically with regard to its operations in Iraq, have persisted since before the &lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20War"&gt;Iraq War&lt;/a&gt;. The associations between U.S. Vice President &lt;a href="w%3ADick%20Cheney"&gt;Dick Cheney&lt;/a&gt; and Halliburton, have been the basis for repeated speculation over possible political improprieties and business &lt;a href="w%3Aprofiteering"&gt;profiteering&lt;/a&gt; from the war.

Among the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;senators&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;representatives&lt;/a&gt; present at the hearing were &lt;a href="w%3AByron%20Dorgan"&gt;Byron Dorgan&lt;/a&gt; (presiding), &lt;a href="w%3AHenry%20Waxman"&gt;Henry Waxman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFrank%20Lautenberg"&gt;Frank Lautenberg&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Dayton"&gt;Mark Dayton&lt;/a&gt;. 

Among those testifying were &lt;a href="w%3ABunny%20Greenhouse"&gt;Bunny Greenhouse&lt;/a&gt;, former Chief Contracting Officer of the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers"&gt;U.S. Army Corps of Engineers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARory%20Mayberry"&gt;Rory Mayberry&lt;/a&gt;, former Food Program Manager for Halliburton subsidiary, and &lt;a href="w%3AAllan%20Waller"&gt;Allan Waller&lt;/a&gt;, of the &lt;a href="w%3ALloyd-Owen%20International"&gt;Lloyd-Owen International&lt;/a&gt; security and operations firm.

Greenhouse, who provided the bulk of testimony, spoke for several minutes about her involvement in the evaluation and crafting of government Army contracts, and how explaining how superiors undermined and dismissed her concerns of illegal business practices. "Ultimately my main concern was the repeated insistence that the &lt;a href="w%3A"&gt;Rio contract&lt;/a&gt; be awarded to KBR without competitive bidding," Greenhouse said. She testified to have been given misinformation in answer to her complaints, and being "overtly misled" by KBR managers.

Mayberry, still in Iraq, testified by video from questions prepared by the committee. He said that KBR routinely sold expired food rations to the Army. The interviewer asked, "Are you saying that Halliburton deliberately falsified the number of meals they prepared and then submitted false claims for reimbursement and that they did this to make up for past amounts auditors had disallowed?" Mayberry firmly answered "Yes." He said that serving expired food ration was "an everyday occurrence, sometimes every meal." He explained that Halliburton systematically overcharged for the number of meals as well, saying, "they were charging for 20,000 meals and they were only serving 10,000 meals." Dorgan later commented, "obviously there's no honor here, by a company that would serve outdated food to our troops in Iraq." 

Mayberry also claimed would-be &lt;a href="w%3Awhistleblower"&gt;whistleblower&lt;/a&gt;s were threatened "to be sent to &lt;a href="w%3AFalluja"&gt;Falluja&lt;/a&gt;" and other "places under fire" if they talked to media or governmental oversight officials. In 2003 and 2004, Falluja had been well known as dangerous for foreign troops and civilians. "I personally was sent to Falluja for three weeks. The manager told me that I was being sent away until the auditors were gone, because I had talked to the auditors," Mayberry said.

"The threat of being sent to a camp under fire was their way of keeping us quiet. The employees who talked to auditors were sent to camps under more fire than other camps, and &lt;a href="w%3ACamp%20Anaconda"&gt;Anaconda&lt;/a&gt;." This report led Dorgan and others to voice considerable outrage that U.S. citizens would be personally threatened with harm for talking to oversight officials or media.

Allan Waller testified to specific examples of how KBR officials had conspired in blocking Lloyd-Owen fuel transports, and using other coercive means against its competitor. The &lt;a href="w%3ABritish"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; Lloyd-Owen has a direct contract with the &lt;a href="w%3AIraqi%20government"&gt;Iraq government&lt;/a&gt; to provide &lt;a href="w%3Afuel"&gt;fuel&lt;/a&gt; to various parts of the country.

In his introductory remarks, Dorgan explained that Senate &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Republican%20Party"&gt;Republicans&lt;/a&gt; had blocked or ignored any requests by Democrats to have a formal &lt;a href="w%3Abipartisanship"&gt;bipartisan&lt;/a&gt; hearing, resulting in the need for an independent committee.

The President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, accused foreign funds and donators of ideological expansion in Belarus during his meeting with talented youth today.

"In recent years, activities of foreign donators, who were carrying out ideological expansion on Belarus disguised as humanitarian aid, and really stealing State's intellectual possession, was curbed," Lukashenko said.

France has won a years-long battle to host ITER, the 'next step' in nuclear fusion research. Nuclear fusion is the process that powers our sun, and could potentially lead to almost unlimited energy available on Earth.

Under the terms of the agreement reached today, France will pay 50% of the construction costs of the 10 billion euro (£6.6bn) program costs, while Japan will gain 20% of the 200 research jobs that will be part of the project, but pay only 10% of the costs.

Speaking before an audience of 750 soldiers and airmen on Tuesday night at &lt;a href="w%3AFort%20Bragg%2C%20North%20Carolina"&gt;Fort Bragg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Carolina"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, US President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush&lt;/a&gt; began an effort to shore up waning support for military actions in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. 

The president again attempted to link the &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%2C%202001%20attacks"&gt;September 11, 2001 attacks&lt;/a&gt; with his decision to invade and occupy Iraq(The U.S. official &lt;a href="w%3A9/11%20Commission"&gt;9/11 Commission&lt;/a&gt; report concluded that Saddam and Iraq were not involved in 9/11 in any way). Right from the opening of his speech, he mentioned the 9/11 attacks and also did it on four additional occasions. During the speech, Bush did not refer to the now-relinquished hunt for &lt;a href="w%3AWeapons%20of%20mass%20destruction"&gt;weapons of mass destruction&lt;/a&gt; (WMDs) in Iraq. The U.S. has failed to provide any convincing evidence for the existence of a WMD, even though this was one of the chief reasons President Bush cited to justify the invasion of Iraq.

Democrats criticized the president for trying to link 9/11 with the war in Iraq;"The president's frequent references to the terrorist attacks of September 11 show the weakness of his arguments," Nancy Pelosi, House Democratic leader, said. "He is willing to exploit the sacred ground of 9/11, knowing that there is no connection between 9/11 and the war in Iraq."

Opinion polling conducted this week by ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AUSA%20Today"&gt;USA Today&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and ♡❤Gallup♡❤ found for the first time that a majority of Americans, 50% to 47%, see the Iraqi war as something separate from what Bush is calling the "global war against terrorism."

The speech comes as more bad news regarding the Iraq War, amid rising &lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20War%20casualties"&gt;IraqI War casualties&lt;/a&gt; (1,740 killed, 13,000 wounded), and damaging testimony to the U.S. Congress about &lt;a href="Civilians%20testify%20to%20Halliburton%20fraud%2C%20coercion"&gt;Halliburton fraud in Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="w%3ADowning%20Street%20Memo"&gt;Downing Street Memo&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, vice-president &lt;a href="w%3ADick%20Cheney"&gt;Dick Cheney&lt;/a&gt;'s claim that the Iraqi insurgency was in its "last throes" was contradicted in Senate testimony by General &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Abizaid"&gt;John Abizaid&lt;/a&gt;, who said "In terms of comparison from six months ago, in terms of foreign fighters, I believe there are more foreign fighters coming into Iraq than there were six months ago."

In his speech, Bush discussed the question of setting a timeline for withdrawal of troops, or sending more troops. 
"Some Americans ask me, if completing the mission is so important, why don't you send more troops? If our commanders on the ground say we need more troops, I will send them. But our commanders tell me they have the number of troops they need to do their job," Bush said. US Commanders have previously commented on the problems caused by lack of coverage at the Syrian border.

The president said the war effort is a two-pronged strategy using military and political pressure to install, "a free, representative government [in Iraq] that is an ally in the war on terror." The U.S. and multi-national Iraqi military coalition goal is an offensive campaign to take the fight to terrorists and insurgents in the region. The elimination of &lt;a href="w%3ASaddam%20Hussien"&gt;Saddam Hussien&lt;/a&gt; was a necessary step to build, "institutions of a free society, a society based on freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of religion, and equal justice under law." Bush cited the free national elections held in January and the establishment of a Transitional National Assembly as progress on the political front, and now calls for the drafting of a constitution with the involvement of Shia, Kurds and Sunni groups.

The speech was received by the usually spirited troops in an atmosphere of quiet that only once interrupted his speech with polite applause near the end when Bush said: "So we'll fight them there, we'll fight them across the world, and we will stay in the fight until the fight is won."

In a 158 to 133 vote of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20House%20of%20Commons"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; held Tuesday night, Canadian MPs have approved the legalization of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASame-sex%20marriage"&gt;same-sex weddings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;. Assuming the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; passes &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABill%20C-38"&gt;Bill C-38&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGovernor%20General%20of%20Canada"&gt;Governor General&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; gives &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Assent"&gt;royal assent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Canada will become the fourth country in the world to legalize same-sex weddings after the &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Belgium"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;. The bill presented to the House of Commons by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Liberal government&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of Prime Minister &lt;a href="Paul%20Martin"&gt;Paul Martin&lt;/a&gt; has passed mainly because of support by the left-wing &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;New Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;a href="Jack%20Layton"&gt;Jack Layton&lt;/a&gt; and the support of the separatist &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABloc%20Qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois"&gt;Bloc Québécois&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which enabled it to overcome the staunch opposition of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

While this vote is historic, gay weddings had already been legalized by the Supreme Courts of most Canadian provinces. The C-38 bill now extends these rulings to the rest of Canada, namely to the provinces of &lt;a href="Alberta"&gt;Alberta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Prince%20Edward%20Island"&gt;Prince Edward Island&lt;/a&gt;, and the territory of &lt;a href="Nunavut"&gt;Nunavut&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="Northwest%20Territories"&gt;Northwest Territories&lt;/a&gt;.

The adoption of this bill ends a longstanding political and judicial debate in Canada, with the House of Commons referring the issue to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASupreme%20Court%20of%20Canada"&gt;Supreme Court of Canada&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; last year, only to have it handed back to them by the judges. If the debate has just been closed in a political sense, gay rights continue to create tensions between Canadians, since support for gay weddings comes mainly from &lt;a href="Quebec"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Ontario"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt; and parts of &lt;a href="British%20Columbia"&gt;British Columbia&lt;/a&gt; while the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMaritime"&gt;Maritimes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20prairies"&gt;Prairie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; provinces are mostly against them.

Those tensions have also been felt in the House of Commons itself, when Conservative Party leader &lt;a href="Stephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt; said on Monday, anticipating that the C-38 bill would be adopted, that the vote would "lack in legitimacy" since the bill would pass because of an unnatural alliance between the federalist Liberals and the separatist Bloc Québécois. This partisan view of gay rights has been strongly condemned, especially by Bloc Québécois leader &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGilles%20Duceppe"&gt;Gilles Duceppe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; who said that MPs from his party were democratically elected and as legitimate as any in parliament. Others called Harper a hypocrite, pouncing on the fact that he never raised any such objections allying with the Bloc in the previous month's confidence votes. Prior to the vote, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Comuzzi"&gt;Joe Comuzzi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; announced his resignation from the Liberal cabinet because of his opposition to gay weddings and the fact that Liberal cabinet members were required to vote the party line in this case.

The Modern Library ranked Foote's ♡❤The Civil War: A Narrative♡❤ as number 15 on its list of 100 best non-fiction books. He was commissioned to write a short history of the Civil War by Random House and spent more than 20 years on the work eventually producing the three volumes.
&lt;p&gt;
Foote was commissioned as a captain in the United States Army during World War II and lost his commission after visiting a female friend in an army vehicle without permission. He returned to the United States and joined the Marines in whose service he spent the remainder of the war.
&lt;p&gt;
Following the war he was briefly a reporter for the Associated Press.
&lt;p&gt;
Pulitzer Prize winning author and friend, Richard Ford said of Foote, "He was a Southerner of great intellect who took up the issue of the Civil War as a writer with huge sanity and sympathy."

<h1>Maciej Zurawski accepts Celtic's offer</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Maciej%20Zurawski%20accepts%20Celtic%27s%20offer&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Forward &lt;a href="w%3AMaciej%20Zurawski"&gt;Maciej Żurawski&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most famous &lt;a href="Poland"&gt;Polish&lt;/a&gt; footballers, accepted a contract offer from &lt;a href="w%3ACeltic%20F.C."&gt;Celtic&lt;/a&gt; yesterday. He is now waiting for agreement between Celtic and his former club, &lt;a href="w%3AWisla%20Krakow"&gt;Wisla Krakow&lt;/a&gt;, where he played for nearly 6 years.

Wisła wants to receive a lump sum payment at once, but Celtic would like to pay circa 3 millions euro in installments.

Żurawski, the star of &lt;a href="w%3APoland"&gt;Polish&lt;/a&gt; national football team, rejected an offer from Trabzonspor. The Turks had offered approximately 100 thousand euro more for him. If he had accepted this offer, he would play alongside former Wisła's player, &lt;a href="w%3AMiroslaw%20Szymkowiak"&gt;Mirosław Szymkowiak&lt;/a&gt;.

Many people, including former Celtic star &lt;a href="w%3ADariusz%20Wdowczyk"&gt;Dariusz Wdowczyk&lt;/a&gt;, believe he made the right decision. He will play for a club with a long history of international presence, and with chances of appearing in the Champions League this year, something Żurawski's expressed as his dream.

Celtic will be Żurawski's fourth club in his career. He has played for Warta Poznan, Lech Poznan, and for Wisla. He will earn over &lt;a href="w%3AEuro"&gt;€&lt;/a&gt;700 thousands per year.

♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Scotsman"&gt;Scotland on Sunday&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ published, this Sunday, the results of an undercover investigation into the protests planned for the ♡❤♡&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A31st%20G8%20summit"&gt;31st G8 summit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡. The investigation of the "anarchists and dissenters" of the movement lasted six months and was carried out by Scott McCulloch, on behalf of the &lt;a href="Scotland"&gt;Scottish&lt;/a&gt; newspaper's broadsheet Sunday edition.

McCulloch's report details the training camps of the protest groups that were held this weekend in preparation for the summit next month. Attendees were expected to learn how to cut or climb over fences and how to avoid injury from attacks by guard dogs. Factories making tubes that protesters use to lock themselves to other protesters are also being set up according to the report on the investigation. Massive road blocks are planned in an attempt to disrupt the summit.

The protests are expected to be coordinated from a central point at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEcovillage"&gt;Ecovillage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in Forthbank, close to the city of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStirling"&gt;Stirling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in central Scotland. An area of land owned by the Council was approved as the location for the ecovillage by Stirling Council on Friday 24 June. The site is intended to be a solar powered campsite for an allegiance of groups making up a possible total of 5000 people. A license to hold the event at Forthbank was sought by Convergence 2005 after two other proposed sites had already been disallowed by the Council. 

Despite last minute objections raised by Central Scotland Police, the Council decided that Forthbank would be the least disruptive location for the protesters to gather, and noted that security measures had been taken. Security measures are already visible at other camps, including a steel barrier around the campsite at Craigmillar, Edinburgh. More serious security measures, designed to protect the attendees of the Summit, will involve warships and army helicopters, according to an editorial by Murdo MacLeod in the Scotland On Sunday on Sunday 26. The paper also reports that Mike Smith, from King's College London, says that security fences and police snipers are expected to be surrounding the area of the Summit.

The summit itself is taking place in Gleneagles, which is 20 miles away from the main campsite in Forthbank. The ecovillage is expected to open at the start of July.

<h1>Fiji girls missing; feared dead</h1>
♡❤♡, ♡❤♡ 

Three teen-aged sisters went missing on Sunday, June 26th, and &lt;a href="Fiji"&gt;Fiji&lt;/a&gt;an police have called in navy divers to aid in the search.

Ashika Sherin Lata, 19, Renuka Roshni Lata, 18 and Radhika Roshni Lata, 17 were taken on a boat trip to Malake island near &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AViti%20Levu"&gt;Viti Levu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by a family friend. The friend "was found alone in the boat and then he informed the family that he was assaulted by three Fijians", Constable Prashila Narayan told Radio New Zealand International.

Divisional Crime Officer Vijay Singh reported additional officers have been called in on the case, but told Fijilive that the navy divers were necessary for the case.

"Until [the navy divers come in] we are just searching around the island where they disappeared and hopefully try and get clues as to which direction they may have been heading."

The US military has confirmed that 17 servicemen were onboard a &lt;a href="w%3ACH-47%20Chinook"&gt;CH-47 Chinook&lt;/a&gt; helicopter that has crashed near &lt;a href="w%3AAsadabad%2C%20Afghanistan"&gt;Asadabad, Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, on June 28. The fate of the men being transported to an area of &lt;a href="w%3AAl-Qaeda"&gt;Al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; resistance is unknown. 

Coalition and Afghan troops moved into the area to secure the site and other coalition aircraft have been sent to assist. The crash occurred high up in mountainous terrain, and is believed to have been the result of hostile fire. Efforts to search for the crash site are being met by bad weather and harsh terrain.

The helicopter was transporting forces as part of ongoing operations to fight militants who operate in the area, and who have recently been escalating their attacks.

The &lt;a href="w%3ATaliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt; claimed they shot the helicopter down. A man claiming to be a spokesman for the Taliban, Abdul Latif Hakimi, reported the downing of the helicopter to offices in &lt;a href="w%3AKabul"&gt;Kabul&lt;/a&gt; before news of the crash was released by the U.S. military. The Hakimi relationship to the Taliban is unclear, and his reports are sometimes inaccurate. He claimed that video footage of the attack would be posted to a Taliban Web site at the address &lt;a href="http%3A//www.alemarah.com/"&gt;www.alemarah.com&lt;/a&gt;. The ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Times"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reported the site appeared blocked later in the day on Wednesday, although the site is still visible in &lt;a href="http%3A//66.102.9.104/search%3Fq%3Dcache%3Agfp-7b1-BB0J%3Awww.alemarah.com/%2B%26amp%3Bhl%3Den"&gt;Google's cache&lt;/a&gt;.

At least 29 service men have died in Afghanistan this year, while at least 450 people have been killed in the last three months, mostly militants. A Chinook which crashed in April with the loss of 18 lives was brought down by a sandstorm.

<h1>Fathers mourn slain children in Arizona</h1>
♡❤♡, ♡❤♡ 

The fathers of Adrienne Heredia's four children, slain together with their mother and her boyfriend Luis Rios, 35, are grieving their loss in &lt;a href="w%3AYuma%2C%20Arizona"&gt;Yuma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AArizona"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;, but have little information from the police about the crime.

The children, son Danny Heredia III, 6; daughter, Inez Newman, 9; and two other sons - Andreas Crawford, 13, and Enrique Bedoya, 12, were found inside the home with their mother after police were called to the scene the night of June 24th on reports of guns shots. Mr. Rios was found in the backyard, still alive at the time but died later in hospital.

"It feels like a nightmare," said Danny Heredia Jr., father of Danny Heredia III. The fathers were contacted by authorities before the names were released to the press. Kenneth Crawford learned of the death of his sons Andreas and Enrique when he returned a trip to Los Angeles, and Inez's father William C. Newman Jr. was contacted at work.

Police released very few new details at their June 27th press conference on the case. They have a witness reporting a man fleeing the scene, and a sketch has been released. However, police are unsure if the crime is the work of a single individual, or if others were involved. 

"This type of investigation, because of the complexity of it, is not going to take a few minutes," Police Chief William Robinson said.

&lt;a href="w%3AAutopsy"&gt;Autopsies&lt;/a&gt; have been ordered, and the causes of death will not be released until they are completed.

&lt;a href="w%3ASerbia%20and%20Montenegro"&gt;Serbia and Montenegro&lt;/a&gt; international, &lt;a href="w%3AMateja%20Ke%C5%BEman"&gt;Mateja Kežman&lt;/a&gt;, will sign a three year contract with &lt;a href="w%3AAtl%C3%A9tico%20de%20Madrid"&gt;Atlético de Madrid&lt;/a&gt; today. The striker spent an unsuccessful season with &lt;a href="w%3AChelsea%20F.C."&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt; and all three parties have agreed to this €7 million transfer.

Kežman started his career in Serbia and Montenegro, where he became popular while playing for &lt;a href="w%3A%20FK%20Partizan"&gt;Partizan, Belgrade&lt;/a&gt;. He was bought by the Dutch team &lt;a href="w%3A%20PSV%20Eindhoven"&gt;PSV&lt;/a&gt;, where he was a prolific striker, setting a record number of goals per season. His year in Chelsea was not as successful, as he mostly started games as a substitute and managed to score only seven goals in official games.

Other teams that demonstrated an interest in Kežman this summer included &lt;a href="w%3ASevilla%20FC"&gt;Sevilla&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AOlympique%20de%20Marseille"&gt;Olympique de Marseille&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AFC%20Schalke%2004"&gt;Schalke 04&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>Rwandan businessmen sentenced for War Crimes</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Rwandan%20businessmen%20sentenced%20for%20War%20Crimes&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Two &lt;a href="Rwanda"&gt;Rwanda&lt;/a&gt;n businessmen were sentenced to 10 and 12 years for their role in the 1994 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARwandan%20genocide"&gt;Rwandan genocide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The two, tried in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABelgium"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , could have faced up to 25 years in prison, the court decided on a lesser sentence as the convicted businessmen played no direct role in the killings. They were convicted based on their offers of transportation and weapons to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHutu"&gt;Hutu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; militas in the planned massacre of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATutsi"&gt;Tutsis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in a church and a municipal building where Tutsis and Hutus had met.

The trial was one of only two ground-breaking trials held in Belgium since local law changed to allow Belgian courts to prosecute violations of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeneva%20conventions"&gt;Geneva conventions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on the conduct of war regardless of where the violations occurred. The law was revised in 2003 to limit its scope as activists had attempted to seek the prosecution of world leaders including &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . As Belgian citizens, the two Rwandans were subject to the new law.

The 1994 Rwandan genocide was an eruption of ethnic conflict where Hutu militia, supported by the Hutu dominated government and encouraged by 'hate radio', attempted to ethnically cleanse the minority Tutsi. Despite numerous warnings the international community did not take serious action to prevent the atrocities, which included hacking people to death with machetes, and forcing people into buildings that were then destroyed with bulldozers. Estimates place the number killed at up to one million.

A major programme is trying to complete trials for genocidaires by the end of 2008. Major perpetrators are being tried at four courts of the International Criminal Tribunal in Tanzania, while in Rwanda &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGacaca%20court"&gt;Gacaca courts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are reaching the end of the investigation stage, after which communities will collectively decide on guilt and punishment at weekly Gacaca sessions throughout the summer.

U.S. Military confirms 17 servicemen, who's fate is still unknown, were onboard a CH-47 Chinook helicopter that has crashed near Asadabad, Afghanistan, on June 28, 2005. 

A man claiming to be a spokesman for the Taliban, Abdul Latif Hakimi, reported the downing of the helicopter to offices in Kabul before news of the crash was released by the U.S. military. 

The helicopter was transporting forces as part of ongoing operations to fight militants who operate in the area, and who have recently been escalating their attacks.

Coalition and Afghan troops were mobilized to secure the area, but rescue efforts are being met by bad weather and harsh terrain.

A co-operation between the &lt;a href="w%3AKDE"&gt;KDE&lt;/a&gt; group - makers of a free desktop for &lt;a href="w%3ALinux"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; - and the Wikimedia Foundation has been announced at the LinuxTag Conference in &lt;a href="w%3AKarlsruhe"&gt;Karlsruhe&lt;/a&gt;. They intend to build a protocol which will make it possible to access Wikimedia project's data from any application, but especially from the KDE suite.

The KDE Group will try to integrate some of the applications from the package with Wikimedia data. For example, AmaroK, media player, will use Wikipedia data to show information about music being played at the moment. Some other applications, including chemical database Kalzium, a database of information about the sky KStars and office suite KOffice will use data from Wikipedia, or from its sister projects.

It will be based on SOAP/WSDL technology, which is already used by the Google API. It could be used on almost every platform and programming environment.

It is also possible to include the Wikipedia archive in some of KDE's CD editions to make it possible to use the data from Wikipedia on machines without an internet connection.

After 4:1 victory over &lt;a href="Argentina"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Brazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; won this year's &lt;a href="w%3AConfederations%20Cup"&gt;Confederations Cup&lt;/a&gt; yesterday. The match took place in &lt;a href="w%3AFrankfurt"&gt;Frankfurt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, in very bad weather conditions.

In 12th minute Adriano dribbled past some opponents and scored a great goal from over eighteen meters. Lux had no chance. Four minutes later Kaká scored the next goal with another powerful long shot from the outer of the penalty area. 

After that, the Argentinians seemed as if they lost belief in positive outcome, but they were determined to change the situation. Riquelme, Sorin, Placente and others were trying to score a goal, but were unable to do get one past the posts.

At the beginning of the second half, in 46th minute, full-back Cicinho, who is currently playing for Santos, made a wonderful pass to Ronaldinho, and there was 3:0 on the scoreboard. Next goal, scored by Adriano, came about twenty minutes later, after Ronaldinho's pass.

Argetinians still wanted to change the result. Two minutes after Adriano's goal, Pablo Aimar, a substitute, scored, but his team was unable to win.

When the match were reaching the end, Brazilian substituters started to dance and be delighted over the title that they won.

Brazil's first matches at the Confederations Cup were poor. Their draw with Japan, and loss to Mexico, made their supporters unhappy. But Carlos Alberto Parreira led the team to the top of competitions, which is considered a preparation for the World Cup.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASeoul"&gt;Seoul&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 

The &lt;a href="w%3AOhmyNews"&gt;OhmyNews&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤International Citizen Reporters' Forum♡❤ (see &lt;a href="OhmyNews%20citizen%20reporters%20meet%20in%20Seoul%2C%20Korea"&gt;previous report&lt;/a&gt;) concluded on Saturday with several speeches and a visit to sponsoring companies in South Korea's technology sector. Some invited "citizen reporters" from around the world extended their stay by several days to tour the country. Since the conclusion of the conference, presentations and transcripts have been published on the OhmyNews web site. &lt;a href="http%3A//english.ohmynews.com/english/eng_section.asp%3Farticle_class%3D11"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

<h2>Wikinews and OhmyNews</h2>

The forum sessions took place in the conference center of the COEX Convention &amp; Exhibition Center in Seoul. Interpreters provided translation services into English and Korean. Saturday began with a series of panels, each one consisting of three short presentations followed by a brief discussion with the audience. The first presentation was an introduction to Wikinews by Erik Möller (&lt;a href="http%3A//www.scireview.de/temp/wikinews.pdf"&gt;online copy&lt;/a&gt;). Möller described the history of the project and its relation to the well-known online encyclopedia &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, demonstrated a working copy of the wiki software &lt;a href="w%3AMediaWiki"&gt;MediaWiki&lt;/a&gt;, and showed some example Wikinews articles. He listed different possibilities for cooperation between Wikinews and OhmyNews, particularly content partnerships, shared communication channels and shared resource pools for citizen journalists. "I extend the hand of friendship to OhmyNews," Möller concluded.

A brief presentation of the history of OhmyNews by Jean K. Min, Director of the International Division, followed. Min cited media reports emphasizing the growing significance of the web site in Korea, and outlined the strategy of expansion to new markets. The English edition, officially launched in May 2004, is seen as a key project in this regard, a test for the feasibility of the OhmyNews model outside Korea. Contributors to both the English and the Korean version receive a small compensation for their work, and the Korean edition uses an integrated payment system that has led to donations ("tips") of thousands of dollars to some OhmyNews contributors.

In the panel discussion that followed, one audience member asked whether, given the for-profit nature of OhmyNews and the non-profit nature of Wikinews, there might be a potential for conflict. Möller responded that, in his view, it was the compatible philosophies of the projects that mattered, and that a for-profit endeavor did not necessarily mean that all competitors have to be destroyed. "I don't think Oh Yeon Ho wants to be a new Rupert Murdoch," he said.
<h2>Grass-roots journalism in the U.S. and "user-created content"</h2>

The first speaker of the next session was Clyde Bentley, Associate Professor for online journalism at the University of Missouri. Bentley introduced the project &lt;a href="http%3A//www.mymissourian.com"&gt;MyMissourian.com&lt;/a&gt;, which he has founded together with journalism students. As in the case of OhmyNews, editors vet stories submitted by "citizen reporters." Bentley's group organized several special reporting events, such as one centering around &lt;a href="w%3AEarth%20Day"&gt;Earth Day&lt;/a&gt;, a festival about environmental awareness: "We set up a booth, and we set up some wireless computers and some other materials, and let people come in and just write about Earth Day. It was very successful." The most successful part of the experiment, according to Bentley, was to lend digital cameras to let people take and share photos.

Bentley argued that alternative journalism was less needed in the United States than in South Korea due to its long democratic tradition. He sees the usefulness of projects like MyMissourian.com in raising awareness of local issues and stories that might otherwise be ignored. The challenge, Bentley concluded, is to build a new "journalism of sharing." Instead of being storytellers, journalists in such a scenario would be "story guides", assuring consistency and quality.

The next speaker on the panel was Jeremy Iggers, a reporter for the ♡❤Minneapolis Star Tribune♡❤ who did not, however, speak as a representative of his newspaper. He gave a prepared speech &lt;a href="http%3A//english.ohmynews.com/articleview/article_view.asp%3Fmenu%3Dc10400%26amp%3Bno%3D234371%26amp%3Brel_no%3D1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; contrasting his early efforts promoting civic journalism with his latest endeavors in citizen journalism. "I can trace this interest in citizen journalism back to the early 90s, when I created a public journalism project called ♡❤Minnesota's Talking♡❤ for the Minneapolis Star Tribune," Iggers said. Readers were invited to join monthly issue discussion groups in private homes, community centers, libraries, and sometimes churches. "At the peak, we had around 100 meeting sites, with over 1,000 participants."

However, this and similar experiments in civic journalism were cancelled, which Iggers called "really unfortunate." As a revitalization of these abortive efforts online, Iggers has founded the ♡❤Twin Cities Media Alliance♡❤, which he wants to use to bootstrap a "Community Newswire" following a similar model to OhmyNews. Beyond reports by citizens, Iggers also wants to make use of stories published by local community newspapers in Minneapolis. He emphasized that this project is independent from his work for the ♡❤Star Tribune♡❤, and that it might be viewed as a conflict of interest.

The final speaker of this panel was &lt;a href="http%3A//www.city.ac.uk/journalism/people/staff/njthurman.html"&gt;Neil Thurman&lt;/a&gt;, Associate Professor at the City University London. Thurman has conducted extensive studies on how traditional media in the United Kingdom make use of "user-generated content" on the Internet: "♡❤The Guardian♡❤, for example, which is the most popular British news website, allows unedited and unselected comments on its pages; none of the other newspapers in the UK does." Thurman also argued that "the amounts of user participation that's archived on message boards varies a great deal, you can see with the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ADaily%20Mail"&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, there's over a million posts, whereas the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AFinancial%20Times"&gt;Financial Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ has barely 10,000."
One of Thurman's key observations is that some user forums and feedback mechanisms were shut down or strongly restricted due to a perceived lack of control over the nature of the comments published in this way. Government-funded or 'public-service' efforts, Thurman observed, are generally more open to the idea of experimenting with user-created content.
<h2>Citizen reporters in their own words</h2>

The afternoon sessions focused mostly on the individual stories of OhmyNews citizen reporters from Korea and around the world. This included testimonials from:
<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Kim Hye Won♡❤♡, who introduced herself as "a traditional Korean housewife who lives together with a husband, two children and an 86-year-old mother-in-law." She wrote many of the "life stories" that are typical for OhmyNews, such as "I Donated Blood to See a Movie for Free” and "Daddy’s Depressed, Son’s Taking Tests, And I'm Worried." These stories exist between the fields of traditional journalism and blogs, as they do not report significant events, but they are nevertheless edited by the OhmyNews staff like regular stories. According to many speakers at the conference, they embody Oh Yeon Ho's vision of "every citizen as a reporter." &lt;a href="http%3A//english.ohmynews.com/articleview/article_view.asp%3Fmenu%3Dc10400%26amp%3Bno%3D234603%26amp%3Brel_no%3D1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Goh Tae Jin♡❤♡, a Korean business owner who mostly contributes columns to OhmyNews. He described his experience of joining OhmyNews, originally to rebut a column published on the site -- and suddenly finding that his rebuttal "was chosen as the top article and suddenly sparked numerous heated opinions." In spite of the many political columns he wrote since then, Goh Tae Jin emphasized that he felt that the key element of OhmyNews were "life stories" such as those written by Kim Hye Won. &lt;a href="http%3A//english.ohmynews.com/articleview/article_view.asp%3Fmenu%3Dc10400%26amp%3Bno%3D234589%26amp%3Brel_no%3D1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Ana Maria Brambilla♡❤♡, an OhmyNews reporter from Brazil and a graduate student in communications. Brambilla contrasted the OhmyNews approach to citizen journalism with &lt;a href="w%3Aopen%20source"&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt; software development and referred to OhmyNews as an example of "open source journalism" due to the fact that anyone has access to the tools of publishing.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Sung Nag-Sun♡❤♡, staff editor at OhmyNews and responsible for submissions by citizen reporters, described his job as polishing stories to get them ready for publication. In the question and answer session, he was asked whether OhmyNews would accept legal liability for stories written by citizen reporters, and took a clear stand in favor of that position: If his team approved a story, he argued, they had to do everything to make sure that it is correct, and would take a large part of the responsibility if it is not. Volunteer writers would be offered legal protection on a case-by-case basis.

</ul>
Added to these and other perspectives from reporters for OhmyNews were independent views such as that of Omid Habibinia, an exiled Iranian living in Switzerland and an outspoken critic of the Iranian regime. Habibinia cited the famous case of &lt;a href="w%3AZahra%20Kazemi"&gt;Zahra Kazemi&lt;/a&gt;, an Iranian-born journalist who, many believe, was tortured and killed by Iranian officials. He criticized the extensive measures the Islamic regime had taken against press freedom: "Just days after the revolution in 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini banned newspapers critical of the new government, beginning 26 years of terror, torture, imprisonment, exile and mass killing in Iran. In the last 25 years more than 1,000 newspapers and magazines have been banned in Iran." &lt;a href="http%3A//english.ohmynews.com/articleview/article_view.asp%3Fmenu%3Dc10400%26amp%3Bno%3D234676%26amp%3Brel_no%3D1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

A different story of citizen journalism was told by Ken Takeuchi, the CEO of JanJan, a Japanese citizen journalism site functioning similarly to OhmyNews. Takeuchi argued that the OhmyNews model faced different challenges in Japan than in Korea, particularly a reluctance to express strong opinions (which Takeuchi deemed a different "national character" from Korea), and a widespread feeling that the existing media are doing an adequate job. Due to these and other problems, Takeuchi argued, JanJan had not yet gained a foothold in the Japanese media landscape, receiving about 2 million pageviews a month in May 2005 and publishing about 15 to 20 articles per day.
<h2>Exploring Seoul's technology sector</h2>

After the presentations on citizen journalism, Yoo Hyun-oh, President and CEO of the &lt;a href="w%3ASK%20Corporation"&gt;SK Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, one of the sponsors of the conference, gave a presentation on &lt;a href="w%3ACyworld"&gt;Cyworld&lt;/a&gt;, a very popular online community operated by SK Communications. It offers visitors a so-called "minihompy", a homepage which can be custom-designed using animated avatars and background music. These additions can be purchased using a currency called "acorns." 

Conference attendees had an opportunity to take a closer look at Cyworld in a visit to SK Communications in Seoul, including a step into the "monitoring room" where Cyworld staff observe the operations of the website. While SK Corporation (the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3Achaebol"&gt;chaebol&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ to which SK Communications belongs) was one of the sponsors of the conference, international OhmyNews director Jean K. Min insisted that the technology company visits had no relationship to sponsorship.

Another technology company, NHN Corporation, also received a brief visit from the illustrious group of citizen reporters. NHN operates a search engine called &lt;a href="http%3A//www.naver.com/"&gt;Naver&lt;/a&gt;, which, according to its own data, is more popular than Google in South Korea. NHN attributes this in part to its user-created content: If the search engine does not supply an answer to a query, users are invited to write it. This model, perhaps similar to that of &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, has led to a large database of answers.

The International Citizen Reporters' Forum ended with a closing ceremony and Korean buffet sponsored by the ♡❤Korea National Tourism Organization♡❤. Conversations that began here continued into the night while intoxication increased, and several attendees extended their stay in Seoul to continue socializing and to discover Seoul and the Korean peninsula.

<h1>Bodies found at crash site of US helicopter in Afghanistan</h1>

Thirteen bodies have been found at the site where a US helicopter &lt;a href="US%20helicopter%20with%2017%20on%20board%20believed%20to%20have%20been%20shot%20down%20in%20Afghanistan"&gt;crashed yesterday in Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;.

Seven more soldiers are unaccounted for - including soldiers who were fighting on the ground at the time of the crash

A U.S. official in Washington said on Wednesday said all aboard were presumed dead, although the US military has yet to confirm the news. 

It is understood that the CH-47 Chinook was brought down by a rocket-propelled grenade fired by members of the Taleban, as it was carrying soldiers (including US Navy Seals) into the area to fight militants.

The search and rescue operation is being hampered by poor weather, difficult terrain and by militants operating in the area. Search and rescue personnel reached the site late on Wednesday night.

"It's a search and recovery operation in a tactical environment, which means we have to ensure security throughout," U.S. military spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Jerry O'Hara said.

In other news, the US Department of Defense has announced the death of two soldiers who were killed when their AH-64D Apache attack helicopter crashed in Iraq.

Defending &lt;a href="Wimbledon%20Championships"&gt;Wimbledon&lt;/a&gt; Ladies Singles champion &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMaria%20Sharapova"&gt;Maria Sharapova&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has been beaten by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVenus%20Williams"&gt;Venus Williams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the 2005 semi-final by two sets to love. In the final game, Williams came to match point twice, just as rain began to fall. Both that and the preceding game were hard fought, with a succession of deuces.

The other semi-final, between &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAmelie%20Mauresmo"&gt;Amelie Mauresmo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALindsey%20Davenport"&gt;Lindsey Davenport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , will resume tomorrow after rain forced an early end to play today. The match will resume with Davenport a break up in the final set. The previous sets both went to tie-breaks after both players exchanged breaks of serve.

Both matches were played at the same time - Williams and Sharapova on Centre Court, with Davenport and Mauresmo on No.1 - after early rain meant players could not get onto the courts until late afternoon.

The Queen of Oak Bay, a ferry, owned by British Columbia Ferries, has crashed into several smaller boats in a marina in west Vancouver (Horseshoe Bay) after losing power. There were over 500 passengers onboard as well as 189 vehicles at the time of the crash. There are no reported injuries at this time, as the ferry sounded a warning several times after losing power and drifting uncontrollably into the marina. By approximently 5:30 PM local time officials had determined the hull was sound and the ferry was pulled out of the wreckage and docked at it's berth under the power of tug boats. Passengers who had been stuck aboard the vessel for hours were then allowed to disembark.

There is speculation that the power failure was due to a mechanical fault, possibly the clutch.

<h1>Fiji &quot;running out of patience&quot; with Vanuatu over ban on Fijian biscuits</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Fiji%20%26quot%3Brunning%20out%20of%20patience%26quot%3B%20with%20Vanuatu%20over%20ban%20on%20Fijian%20biscuits&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;br&gt;

&lt;a href="w%3AFiji"&gt;Fiji's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20Foreign%20Ministers%20of%20Fiji"&gt;Foreign Minister&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AKaliopate%20Tavola"&gt;Kaliopate Tavola&lt;/a&gt;, said that the letter being sent to Vanuatu's prime minister would be the final gesture of Fiji's friendship.

In March, the island nation &lt;a href="w%3AVanuatu"&gt;Vanuatu&lt;/a&gt; banned the importation of Fijian biscuits. This was the second ban on Fijian biscuits by Vanuatu in the last six months. Vanuatu has said that this ban is necessary in order to stimulate Vaunatu's biscuit industry.

The company affected by this ban, Flour Mills of Fiji, exports nearly US$900,000 worth of biscuits to Vanuatu yearly. Flour Mills of Fiji has said that the ban has forced them to layoff about a dozen people. They also stated that they will be taking legal action against the Vanuatu government for the ban.

On June 13 the Fijian government announced its intention to stop all commercial relations with Vanuatu unless this issue was resolved. Commercial relations with Vanuatu include Air Vanuatu flights and the importation of Vanuatu kava. Fijian imports of Vanuatu kava bring approximately VT350 million (US$3.2 million) to Vanuatu each year.

The World Health Organisation has announced that the number of people receiving anti-retroviral treatments (ART) in developing countries is increasing significantly - more than doubling between December 2003 and June 2005. One million people are now getting the drugs they need, compared to just 400,000 eighteen months ago.

However, access to treatment is not growing as fast as demand, and the UN is unlikely to reach its target of treating three million people by the end of 2005 - just over half the people who need it. The longer-term target of universal treatment by 2010 is still likely to be met.

The figures show that the number of people receiving ART is increasing in every part of the globe, but not as quickly as people are contracting HIV. The numbers getting treatment in sub-Saharan Africa, the part of the world worst affected by HIV/AIDS has increased threefold on a year ago, and doubled in the last six months. The same rate of growth as also been seen in Asia, the second-worst affected area.

The WHO's report highlights that the best progress has been made when governments have worked together with the WHO, the UN and other parterners. The report goes on to make recommendations for simplifying the process to enable treatment levels to be increased even faster.

The UN's target was based on what was hypothetically possible if all possible steps to provide treatment were taken. The report shows the while financial, political and technical steps have been made, other areas are falling short.

Pressure groups said that countries were reacting too slowly to the pandemic and called on the G8 to provide more sustainable funding for universal treatment for Aids. 

UK international development minister Gareth Thompson said: "We are committed to universal access to HIV treatments by 2010. We will spend £1.5bn in the next three years on Aids, including £150m on orphans."

A section of the rail tunnel outside Gerrards Cross Station in Buckinghamshire collapsed at around 8 p.m. last night. No-one was injured. 20 metres of concrete tunnel and gravel collapsed onto the Chiltern to Marylebone line, closing the railway and causing much disruption. 

The tunnel was created by the supermarket chain Tesco, who had filled in a railway cutting in order to build a supermarket above it. The project was unpopular both among the local community and the rail industry who felt the project put commercial gain before railway safety. 

The accident came hours after another rail accident in East Yorkshire, where a train collided with a car at a level crossing, killing the driver of the car and injuring five train passengers.

A committee of the Fijian &lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20of%20Representatives%20%28Fiji%29"&gt;Parliament&lt;/a&gt; has been receiving submissions this week on its controversial legislation aimed at establishing a &lt;a href="w%3AReconciliation%20and%20Unity%20Commission%20%28Fiji%29"&gt;Commission&lt;/a&gt; with the power to compensate victims and pardon perpetrators of the civilian &lt;a href="w%3AFiji%20coup%20of%202000"&gt;coup d'état&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Speight"&gt;George Speight&lt;/a&gt;, which deposed the elected government of &lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20Prime%20Ministers%20of%20Fiji"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMahendra%20Chaudhry"&gt;Mahendra Chaudhry&lt;/a&gt; in May 2000.

Few pieces of legislation in Fijian &lt;a href="w%3AHistory%20of%20Fiji"&gt;history&lt;/a&gt; have generated such passionate support and opposition from different quarters. Public opinion polls show that the great majority of &lt;a href="w%3AIndo-Fijians"&gt;Indo-Fijians&lt;/a&gt; are opposed to the legislation, along with a large minority of &lt;a href="w%3AFijian%20people"&gt;indigenous Fijians&lt;/a&gt;. Supporters of the bill, being promoted by Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ALaisenia%20Qarase"&gt;Laisenia Qarase&lt;/a&gt; and Attorney-General &lt;a href="w%3AQoriniasi%20Bale"&gt;Qoriniasi Bale&lt;/a&gt;, argue that it will bring closure to the wounds of the 2000 coup and allow the country to move on. Opponents say that it is just a legal mechanism for releasing from prison supporters of the present government, who were convicted of coup-related offenses. For its parliamentary majority, the government relies on its coalition partner, the &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Alliance%20%28Fiji%29"&gt;Conservative Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, several of whose senior members have been found guilty of involvement in the coup.

Opponents of the bill include Roman Catholic Archbishop &lt;a href="w%3APetero%20Mataca"&gt;Petero Mataca&lt;/a&gt;, who shocked many people last week with his claims that a delegation of church leaders, representing a variety of denominations, had been misled by Prime Minister Qarase about what the bill contained. At a meeting on May 2, Mataca said, the Prime Minister had told them about its compensation provisions, but had kept them in the dark about its amnesty clauses - which they learned about only later through the media. The clergymen had supported the bill at the time, he said, because they believed in reconciliation and forgiveness. The later revelations about the amnesty provisions had come as a complete surprise to them, he said. Archbishop Mataca condemned what he said was "a politically motivated bill" and called on the government to withdraw it. Rev. &lt;a href="w%3AJosateki%20Koroi"&gt;Josateki Koroi&lt;/a&gt;, the former president of the Methodist Church, which claims the membership of some two-thirds of indigenous Fijians, has also expressed grave reservations about the bill, saying that reconciliation cannot be legislated and must begin with true repentance on the part of the wrongdoer - something he believes has not happened.

Politicians opposed to the bill include the leaders of all of the Indo-Fijian dominated parties, including former Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry. Indigenous politicians to have spoken out against the bill include Senator &lt;a href="w%3AKoila%20Nailatikau"&gt;Adi Koila Nailatikau&lt;/a&gt; (the daughter of former &lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20Presidents%20of%20Fiji"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AKamisese%20Mara"&gt;Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara&lt;/a&gt;, who was deposed in the coup) and her brother-in-law, &lt;a href="w%3AEpeli%20Ganilau"&gt;Ratu Epeli Ganilau&lt;/a&gt;, founder of the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Alliance%20Party%20of%20Fiji"&gt;National Alliance Party&lt;/a&gt; and son of former President &lt;a href="w%3APenaia%20Ganilau"&gt;Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau&lt;/a&gt;. Ganilau, a former &lt;a href="w%3AMilitary%20of%20Fiji"&gt;military&lt;/a&gt; commander, has called it "an insult to the intelligence of ordinary people" and has warned that the armed forces could use it as a legal mechanism to remove a present or future government, while Nailatikau, who was kidnapped and held as a hostage by the insurrectionists, has said that if her father were alive, he would not approve of tampering with the course of justice. 

One of the most strident voices raised against the legislation is that of the Military commander, Commodore &lt;a href="w%3AFrank%20Bainimarama"&gt;Frank Bainimarama&lt;/a&gt;. Bainimarama, who organized a counter-coup to quash the Speight rebellion in 2000, has been making press statements on almost a daily basis since the middle of May, condemning the legislation as undermining the integrity of the military and the judiciary. He has made a number of veiled statements, interpreted by some politicians as threats, about what the military might do if the bill is passed. Last week, the &lt;a href="w%3AFiji%20Times"&gt;Fiji Times&lt;/a&gt;, Fiji's oldest daily newspaper, quoted an anonymous source, which it claimed was reliable, that President &lt;a href="w%3AJosefa%20Iloilo"&gt;Ratu Josefa Iloilo&lt;/a&gt; (who is rumoured to be against the legislation) had refused a government request to "discipline" Bainimarama. Under the &lt;a href="w%3AConstitution%20of%20Fiji"&gt;Constitution&lt;/a&gt;, the President has very little political power but is Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces.

Supporters of the bill include former Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ASitiveni%20Rabuka"&gt;Sitiveni Rabuka&lt;/a&gt; and some traditional &lt;a href="w%3ARatu"&gt;chiefs&lt;/a&gt;.

Many Fiji citizens have been showing their support for the bill by wearing blue ribbons, or their opposition by wearing yellow ones.

Qoriniasi Bale said two days ago that unless opponents of the bill could make more constructive suggestions for improving it, parliament would most likely pass it without any changes.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice"&gt;U.S. Department of Justice&lt;/a&gt; has announced actions taken in eleven nations as part of the &lt;a href="w%3AFBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt;'s covert "&lt;a href="w%3AOperation%20Site%20Down"&gt;Operation Site Down&lt;/a&gt;". The infiltration of so-called 'Topsites' resulted in searches, arrests, and seizures in &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Belgium"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADenmark"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APortugal"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGreat%20Britain"&gt;Great Britain&lt;/a&gt; in addition to the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.

Messages in response posted on a communications page for warez users read:

An email lists people targeted, updated in Mountain Time (UTC-7) at 6:31pm, 6:36pm, 6:38pm. The last update is at 6:41pm.

The FBI began the sting in 2003, offering hosting for software cracks and movies. As the covert site infiltrated the underground warez and piracy community, it was repeatedly expanded to provide storage for an increasingly large collection of pirated material. Eventually it held some 27 terabytes of copyrighted files, including 188 copyrighted software titles valued at more than &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;300,000.

In the U.S.A. William Venya, 34, of Chatworth, Calif., Chirayu Patel, 23, of Fremont, Calif., Nate Lovell, 22, of Boulder, Colo., and David Fish, 24, of Watertown, Conn were all arrested on criminal complaints of copyright infringement and conspiracy to commit copyright infringement.

In the wake of a &lt;a href="w%3ASupreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;United States Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; ruling in &lt;a href="w%3AKelo%20v.%20New%20London"&gt;Kelo v. New London&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="w%3Aeminent%20domain"&gt;eminent domain&lt;/a&gt; last week, a &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; man has proposed that Justice &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Souter"&gt;David Souter&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Hampshire"&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/a&gt; home be seized by the state and a hotel be built on the site. &lt;a href="w%3ALogan%20Darrow%20Clements"&gt;Logan Darrow Clements&lt;/a&gt; faxed a letter to town officials in &lt;a href="w%3AWeare%2C%20New%20Hampshire"&gt;Weare&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Hampshire"&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/a&gt; June 28, 2005 that justified the action as such:

"The justification for such an eminent domain action is that our hotel will better serve the public interest as it will bring in economic development and higher tax revenue to Weare."

Justice Souter, who was in the majority ruling in the Kelo case, has lived at the farmhouse in Weare since he was 11 years old. Clements indicated that it was necessary to build on that location because "it is a unique site being the home of someone largely responsible for destroying property rights for all Americans." The action has given rise to a great deal of support nationwide, as many are writing to the councilors of the small town of Weare to voice their approval for the proposal.

The proposal for the "&lt;a href="w%3ALost%20Liberty%20Hotel"&gt;Lost Liberty Hotel&lt;/a&gt;", as it is to be called, features a number of components which seem to focus on the &lt;a href="w%3Alibertarian"&gt;libertarian&lt;/a&gt; leanings of its designer. A dining room, called the "Just Desserts Cafe" and a museum based on the "loss of freedom in America" are two such components. Instead of a Bible provided by the &lt;a href="w%3AGideons%20International"&gt;Gideons&lt;/a&gt; (a standard item placed in most American hotel rooms), each guest will receive a free copy of &lt;a href="w%3AAyn%20Rand"&gt;Ayn Rand&lt;/a&gt;'s novel &lt;a href="w%3AAtlas%20Shrugged"&gt;Atlas Shrugged&lt;/a&gt;.

Defending Wimbledon Ladies Singles champion Maria Sharapova has been beaten by Venus Williams in the 2005 semi-final by two sets to none. In the final game, Williams came to match point twice, just as rain began to fall. Both that and the preceding game were hard fought, with a succession of deuces.

The other semi-final, between Amelie Mauresmo and Lindsey Davenport, will resume tomorrow after rain forced an early end to play today. The match will resume with Davenport a break up in the final set. The previous sets both went to tie-breaks after both players exchanged breaks of serve.

Both matches were played at the same time - Williams and Sharapova on Centre Court, with Davenport and Mauresmo on No.1 - after early rain meant players could not get onto the courts until late afternoon.

Adriano broke the ice in the 12th minute from more than 18 metres, quickly followed by a goal from Kaká. In the second half, a pass from Cicinho set up Ronaldinho's goal, and Adriano got a second off Ronaldinho's pass.

Argentina's Pablo Aimar, substituting, scored after and tried start a rally, but they were unable gain any more goals.

&lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20President"&gt;U.S. President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; suspended all sanctions on &lt;a href="w%3ASerbia%20and%20Montenegro"&gt;Serbia and Montenegro&lt;/a&gt; by a decree yesterday. Serbia and Montenegro was under various degrees of economic and other sanctions by the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; and individual countries since 1992. 

Serbia and Montenegro will now enjoy the U.S. &lt;a href="w%3AGeneralized%20System%20of%20Preferences"&gt;Generalized System of Preferences&lt;/a&gt; which includes allowing duty-free import of more then 4600 products. Economic relations between two countries were stabilized in 2003 when Serbia and Montenegro gained a status of most favoured nation.

"We did a study and came to a conclusion that free market exists in Serbia, that there are laws to protect American investors, and we based our decision on that," the U.S. ambassador in Belgrade Michael Polt said. 

The President of Serbia and Montenegro, &lt;a href="w%3ASvetozar%20Marovi%C4%87"&gt;Svetozar Marović&lt;/a&gt;, wrote a letter to Bush thanking him for his move.

&lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, a predominantly &lt;a href="Roman%20Catholic"&gt;Catholic&lt;/a&gt; country, Thursday became the world's third nation to legalize &lt;a href="same-sex%20marriage"&gt;same-sex marriage&lt;/a&gt; following &lt;a href="The%20Netherlands"&gt;The Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Belgium"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;. Canada, whose lower house has voted in favor of same-sex marriage, is widely expected to have that bill pass also in the upper house, making Canada the fourth country to legalize the marriage of gay couples.

By a vote of 187-147 with four abstentions, the 350-seat Congress of Deputies approved the measure to give same-sex couples the same rights as heterosexual ones, including the right to adopt children and inherit each others' property. The bill, which became law immediately, says, "Matrimony shall have the same requirements and effects regardless of whether the persons involved are of the same or different sex."

Catholic leaders and the conservative opposition &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Party%20%28Spain%29"&gt;People's Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; lobbied heavily against the bill "calling it an assault on the institution of marriage and a threat to social stability." The Roman Catholic Church endorsed a June 18 opposition rally in which about two hundred thousand marched through Madrid, including twenty &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="wikt%3Abishop"&gt;bishops&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Recent polls suggest Spaniards support gay marriage, saying 62 percent of Spaniards support the government's action on gay marriage while 30 percent oppose it. 

According to an Associated Press report, Beatriz Gimeno, a longtime leader of Spain's gay rights movement, held back tears as she hugged her partner Boti after the vote.

"It is a historic day for the world's homosexuals. We have been fighting for many years," Gimeno said. "Now comes the hardest part, which is changing society's mentality."

Gay couples can get married as soon as the law is published in the official government registry as early as Friday or within two weeks at the latest, Parliament's press office said.

Today, &lt;a href="w%3ARomania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; introduces its new redenominated currency, the new &lt;a href="w%3ARomanian%20leu"&gt;leu&lt;/a&gt; (code: ♡❤♡RON♡❤♡), which is valued at 10,000 old lei (code: ♡❤♡ROL♡❤♡). The process, which is known as &lt;a href="w%3Aredenomination"&gt;redenomination&lt;/a&gt;, started in March 2005 when Romania started dual-currency display and all prices had to be displayed in both the old leu and the new leu. Starting from today, the first notes and coins of the new leu will become legal tender, and the new leu will become the official currency of Romania.

The redenomination (or conversion from the old to the new leu) is simple &amp;mdash; 10,000 old lei are replaced by 1 new leu. One &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20dollar"&gt;US dollar&lt;/a&gt; will buy 2.98 new lei, while one &lt;a href="w%3Aeuro"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt; will buy 3.6 new lei. After the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Turkish%20Lira"&gt;similar redenomination by Turkey&lt;/a&gt; the old leu had been the world's least valued currency unit, with the US dollar buying 29,891 lei and the euro buying 36,050 lei (on 30 June 2005). With the introduction of the new leu, Romania's currency will be among the most highly-valued in the region.

The new leu notes and coins, introduced into circulation today, will circulate alongside the old lei until 31 December 2006, when the dual-currency period ends and all of the old lei are expected to be withdrawn. However, old lei can be exchanged at banks indefinitely.

The new notes come into denominations of 1, 5, 10, 50, 100 and 500 new lei. The largest note of the old leu was 1,000,000 lei, or 100 new lei. The largest note of the new leu is worth 500 new lei, or approximately US$167 and €139. New leu notes will also have the same dimensions as euro notes of similar value. Additionally, they will use the same colours and design as their corresponding old leu equivalent (for example, the 100 lei note will look similar to the 1,000,000 old lei note). 

All notes will be printed on &lt;a href="w%3Apolymer%20banknote"&gt;polymer materials&lt;/a&gt;. Romania was the first country in Europe to introduce polymer notes, in 1999.

<h2>Redenomination represents the symbolic end to transition</h2>

The governor of the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Bank%20of%20Romania"&gt;National Bank of Romania&lt;/a&gt;, Mugur Isărescu, said that the redenomination of the leu marks the symbolic end of Romania's economic transition from a planned economy under &lt;a href="w%3ACommunist%20Romania"&gt;Communism&lt;/a&gt;, which was overthrown in 1989, to a free market economy. 

The reason for redenomination was mainly the fact that the leu had become severely devalued, especially in the 1990s, due to high inflation rates. From 2002 onwards, the leu stabilised, and has even appreciated against the euro and the US dollar in the past year. Hence, the new leu was introduced to simplify the national currency, and also as a symbol of Romania's increasing economic stability. It is also expected to help pave the way for the adoption of the euro by Romania, which is expected in 2012-2014, after Romania joins the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; in 2007.

<h2>Concern for inflation</h2>

Although the introduction of the new leu is viewed as beneficial on the whole, since it will bring Romania's currency more in line with the value of important global currencies such as the euro and the US dollar, concerns have been raised that the new leu will fuel inflation. Some people are concerned that the new leu will result in the rounding-up of prices, similar to what happened when the euro was introduced in the &lt;a href="w%3AEurozone"&gt;Eurozone&lt;/a&gt; in 2002, and therefore fuel inflation. 

However, a rise in prices is not thought to occur due to the dual-currency display. This ensures that all businesses continue to display prices in both the new leu and the old leu until the end of 2006, and hence they will not be able to raise prices as easily, for fear of becoming less competitive in the market.

The German Federal Chancellor (Bundeskanzler), &lt;a href="w%3AGerhard%20Schr%C3%B6der"&gt;Gerhard Schröder&lt;/a&gt;, deliberately lost a confidence vote in the German lower parliamentary house, the Bundestag. Schröder had aimed to lose the vote of confidence in order to dissolve the Bundestag and to achieve earlier elections. In debate, Schröder argued, that there is no safe majority for his policy in the Bundestag. In his second term as Chancellor, he tried to start a reform agenda (&lt;a href="w%3AAgenda%202010"&gt;Agenda 2010&lt;/a&gt;) which aimed to cut the budget deficit and unemployment in Germany, which has been criticised as &lt;a href="w%3Aneo-liberalism"&gt;neo-liberalism&lt;/a&gt; by several supporters of his party.

During the debate, opposition leader &lt;a href="w%3AAngela%20Merkel"&gt;Angela Merkel&lt;/a&gt; explained that her party, the &lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20Democratic%20Union%20of%20Germany"&gt;Christian Democrats&lt;/a&gt;, supports early elections. However, she did criticise the coalition government of the &lt;a href="w%3ASocial%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany"&gt;Social-Democrats&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AAlliance%20%2790/The%20Greens"&gt;Greens&lt;/a&gt;, for the country's high unemployment rates (which have peaked at 5 million) and low economic growth. A Green deputy, &lt;a href="w%3AWerner%20Schulz"&gt;Werner Schulz&lt;/a&gt;, attacked Schröder's using the vote of confidence in order to achieve early elections, which is from his point of view unconstitutional. &lt;a href="w%3AFranz%20M%C3%BCntefering"&gt;Franz Müntefering&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the Social Democrats had invited members of the ruling coalition to abstain from voting. 151 deputies supported Schröder, 296 voted against him and 148 abstained from voting.

After the lost motion of confidence, the German President &lt;a href="w%3AHorst%20K%C3%B6hler"&gt;Horst Köhler&lt;/a&gt; can examine Schröder's arguments for three weeks and dissolve the Bundestag while setting a date for early elections. At least one deputy has announced he intends going to the &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Constitutional%20Court%20of%20Germany"&gt;Federal Constitutional Court&lt;/a&gt; to appeal against Schöder's way of using the vote of confidence. The court will then have to decide whether it was constitutional or not. 

All parties know that there might be early elections by September. At the moment, opinion polls are showing a majority for conservative opposition.

Thousands of protesters are marching through the streets of &lt;a href="w%3AKinshasa"&gt;Kinshasa&lt;/a&gt; demanding that the government resign over delayed elections.

Kinshasa - a city with nine million residents - is the capital of the &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo"&gt;Democratic Republic of the Congo&lt;/a&gt;.

They were met by security forces who shot in the air and threw &lt;a href="w%3ARiot%20control%20agent"&gt;tear-gas grenades&lt;/a&gt; at the protesters. Army helicopters flew overhead as protestors threw stones at soldiers.

The UN in Congo have said that four people may have been killed in Kinshasa, but that is not yet confirmed. A journalist in the area saw bruised and bandaged protestors who said they had been beaten by police, and a local TV station broadcast images of a protester who they said had been shot dead. The station was raided shortly afterwards by police.

Another six people were killed in Tshikapa, a town 700 km southeast of Kinshasa. In another province, heavy weapons were fired at protesters. Casualties are as yet unknown. The Congolese government has declined to confirm or deny any casualty figures.

Unrest has been growing among the 60 million residents in Congo - a &lt;a href="w%3ABelgian%20Congo"&gt;former Belgian colony&lt;/a&gt; - over delays to the first democratic elections to be held for forty years. The elections - which should have been held before last Thursday - were agreed upon as part of a peace treaty that ended a five year civil war in 2003 - a war that had seen the deaths of four million people.

The current President made a television address to the nation the night before the deadline appealing for calm and re-iterating his desire to see elections.

Protest organisers say the people were just peacefully demonstrating their desire to see the interm government resign, but were attacked without provocation by security forces. The government had recently announced another six month delay before elections could take place.

Nine thousand state employees in &lt;a href="Minnesota"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; were left jobless Friday after state legislators failed to pass a spending bill that would have kept the state government up and running. 

"I'd like to say I'm sorry to the people of Minnesota," said &lt;a href="Republican%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; state Rep. Rod Hamilton of Mountain Lake. "This is disgusting." 

It is not uncommon for states to miss their budget deadlines, but Minnesota, in contrast to other states, has no law that automatically extends the previous budget if lawmakers fail to approve a new budget.

Governor &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATim%20Pawlenty"&gt;Tim Pawlenty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; accused &lt;a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt; of intentionally shutting down the government in order to hurt the Republican governor's chances in the 2006 gubernatorial elections.

"The Senate wanted to shut down government from the beginning," said Steve Sviggum, the leading Republican in the Minnesota House of Representatives.

Due to the shutdown, highway rest-stops will not be staffed during the busy July Fourth weekend. Lawmakers agreed, however, to a bill that would keep the state's parks open.

A court order earlier this month requires the state to continue to provide services essential to "health, safety and property."

Butch Leitzinger and Elliot Forbes-Robinson drove the #4 &lt;a href="w%3APontiac"&gt;Pontiac&lt;/a&gt; Crawford GTO into victory lane at &lt;a href="w%3ADaytona%20International%20Speedway"&gt;Daytona International Speedway&lt;/a&gt; late Thursday night as the winner of the Grand American Rolex Sports Car Series Brumos Porsche 250. Early in the race, the #66 car driven by Jorg Bergmeister and Max Papis passed the #10 car in the pole position, maintaining the lead positions for most of the race.

The second caution at lap 32 occurred after a car spun on the infield. The caution lasted 3 laps, and only two laps later a two-car crash happened, sending the race into its third caution. The #06 car, driven by Rob Dyson and Harrison Brix, lost a portion of the car's hood on lap 43 and had to pit, causing the car to drop down a lap.

The Howard-Boss Motorsports #4 car stole the lead position from the #19 Finlay Motorsports car at lap 47, a position it would hold for the remainder of the race. The #10 car with drivers Wayne Taylor and Max Angelelli silently climbed back up to the 2nd position with 17 laps to go. The debuting #65 Pontiac GTO car, sponsored by Auto Gallery, was hit on the backstretch in the left front tire, causing him to spin and hit the wall with 14 laps to go. A similar event happened five laps later when another car spun out. Neither instances resulted in a caution.

Radioactive water is leaking from the nuclear waste store in Forsmark, Sweden. The content of radioactive caesium in sampled water is ten times the normal value. ♡❤Statens strålskyddsinstitut♡❤ (SSI, the Swedish Radiation Protection Authority) believes that the leakage originates from waste barrels that have corroded, since the radioactive water is leaking out from the waste disposal area of the Forsmark power plant. The radiation is, however, still within the allowed limits according to SSI. The waste is low and intermediate level waste. No high level waste has been reported. A new roof is to be constructed for the chamber containing the barrels.

The head of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Food%20Programme"&gt;World Food Programme&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , James Morris, has told the &lt;a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council"&gt;United Nations Security Council&lt;/a&gt; that Africa is facing a food crisis, with one in three people there malnourished.

&lt;a href="Zimbabwe"&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt; is one country that Morris is particularly concerned about at the moment. 

“It does not matter whether that instability is caused by civil conflict, drought, AIDS, poor governance or any combination of those factors-hunger almost always comes with it,” said Morris.

“The impact of rural-urban migration on employment in Africa has been precisely the opposite of Western Europe and the United States - it has led to higher rather than lower rates of unemployment and social instability. 

“At a certain point the capacities of local governments are stretched to the limit and social demands are not met, especially among competing ethnic groups perhaps not accustomed to sharing the same political space.”

In addition to Zimbabwe, 1.6 million in &lt;a href="Malawi"&gt;Malawi&lt;/a&gt;, 1.2 million in &lt;a href="Zambia"&gt;Zambia&lt;/a&gt;, 900,000 in &lt;a href="Mozambique"&gt;Mozambique&lt;/a&gt;, 245,000 in &lt;a href="Lesotho"&gt;Lesotho&lt;/a&gt;, 230,000 in &lt;a href="Swaziland"&gt;Swaziland&lt;/a&gt;, and 60,000 in &lt;a href="Namibia"&gt;Namibia&lt;/a&gt; all need emergency food aid.

According to Morris, the World Food Programme has been told by the Zimbabwe government that they will feed the people, which goes against the policies of the WFP. 

Morris highlighted the effects hunger can have - destabilizing countries and threatening peace and security. Food shortages are driving people into urban areas, where they are confronted by high unemployment and social instability.

&lt;a href="w%3ASupreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;United States Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; Associate Justice &lt;a href="w%3ASandra%20Day%20O%27Connor"&gt;Sandra Day O'Connor&lt;/a&gt;, 75, announced Friday her intention to retire from the court. She said she would be stepping down before the beginning of the court's fall term, or when the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; confirms a successor.

More than 10 years have passed since the last vacancy on the Supreme Court, the highest court in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. Justice &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Breyer"&gt;Stephen Breyer&lt;/a&gt; was the last jurist appointed to the court; Breyer was appointed by President &lt;a href="Bill%20Clinton"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt;. This will be President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush's&lt;/a&gt; first opportunity to appoint a justice to the court. 

Soon after the retirement was announced, President Bush held a short press-conference outside the White House where he praised O'Connor's years of public service. O'Connor has served on the court for 24 years, since her appointment by President Reagan in &lt;a href="w%3A1981"&gt;1981&lt;/a&gt;. 

In July 20 2005 President Bush nominated &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Roberts"&gt;John G. Roberts&lt;/a&gt; as the candidate for the post.

O'Connor was the first female justice, as well as the first from the state of &lt;a href="w%3AArizona"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>New denunciations of Brazilian deputy and evidence make things difficult for Lula</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=New%20denunciations%20of%20Brazilian%20deputy%20and%20evidence%20make%20things%20difficult%20for%20Lula&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AS%C3%A3o%20Paulo%2C%20Brazil"&gt;São Paulo, Brazil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
On June 30, in Brazil, deputy &lt;a href="w%3ARoberto%20Jefferson"&gt;Roberto Jefferson&lt;/a&gt; testified to deputies and senators of a Commission that is investigating the alleged Post Office Service scandal. Jefferson's testimony along with new evidence supporting his testimony are putting the government of President &lt;a href="w%3ALuiz%20In%C3%A1cio%20Lula%20da%20Silva"&gt;Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva&lt;/a&gt; in a difficult situation.

Roberto Jefferson's testimony ran from 4 p.m. to close to 2 a.m. (local time). The deputy further explained the alleged corruption scheme involving the Brazilian &lt;a href="w%3AWorkers%27%20Party%20%28Brazil%29"&gt;Workers' Party&lt;/a&gt; (PT). 

The testimony of Jefferson was at times very tense, and sometimes discussions between Jefferson and deputies of the Workers Party become heated. In one instance, a Workers' Party deputy attacked Jefferson's credibility, calling him a liar on the basis that he supported the former Brazilian President &lt;a href="w%3AFernando%20Collor%20de%20Mello"&gt;Fernando Collor de Mello&lt;/a&gt;, who suffered &lt;a href="w%3Aimpeachment"&gt;impeachment&lt;/a&gt; for corruption related to Treasurer Paulo Cesar Farias, who worked on Collor's campaign. Jefferson answered: "PC Farias is a &lt;a href="w%3AChicken"&gt;chick&lt;/a&gt; when you see the corruption in PT", and accused the former governor of &lt;a href="w%3ARio%20Grande%20do%20Sul"&gt;Rio Grande do Sul&lt;/a&gt; Olivio Dutra (Olivio Dutra is the minister of Lula at the present time) of involvement with the "Jogo do Bicho" (illegal gambling).

According to Jefferson, the President of the Worker's Party José Genuino, former Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9%20Dirceu"&gt;José Dirceu&lt;/a&gt;, Secretary-General Sílvio Pereira, and Treasurer Delúbio Soares, head a widespread national corruption scheme which involves the Workers Party, members of the Government, the Brazilian Agency of Intelligence, and both government and private enterprises. Jefferson said the President was unaware of this scheme. Some members of parliament from the opposition see this claim as strange.

During his last testimony, Jefferson said that entrepreneur Marcos Valério was responsible for finacing the payment of deputies of the alleged Votes-for-cash scandal. This week, investigations by the police showed that Marcos Valério withdrew, in cash, large sums of money from Rural Bank. According to Jefferson, this money was used to pay deputies. Valério said that he used the money to buy cattle and that farmers don't like to receive cheques, just "real money". His explanation was considered suspect and his former secretary said she does not know of any farms owned by Valerio.

Marcos Valério is part-owner of SMPB and DNA. Documents from the Agrarian Reform Institute (INCRA) showed that Valério's enterprises owned 10 big farms. According to an article published by the newspaper &lt;a href="w%3AO%20Estado%20de%20S%C3%A3o%20Paulo"&gt;O Estado de São Paulo&lt;/a&gt; on July 1, at least two of these farms do not exist. The Brazilian Federal Police said that there is evidence sufficient to indict Valério. 
The accusations against Valério are tax evasion and money laundering.

According to Internal Revenue Service, Marcos Valério's fortune was R$ 230,000 (97,676.27 USD - Live mid-market rates as of July 3, 2005, 12:47:43 UTC.) in 1997 and R$ 14,000,000 (5,945,511.97 USD) in 2004, a growth of 6086%. The enterprises of Valério, SMPB and DNA, have contracts with five Ministeries and eight big public enterprises, including the Post Office Service.

Before his testimony to the Commission, Jefferson said that &lt;a href="w%3AFurnas%20%28Brazil%29"&gt;Furnas&lt;/a&gt;, an energy company in Brazil, was involved in a corruption scheme. According to Jefferson, money from the enterprise was moved to the Workers' Party of &lt;a href="w%3AMinas%20Gerais"&gt;Minas Gerais&lt;/a&gt;, to the treasurer Delúbio Soares, to be used to buy deputies. Furnas denied this. Presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said that the allegations should be investigated. Under pressure the Furnas' directors resigned.

On July 2, newspapers reported that according to Brazilian Central Bank's documents, in February 17, 2004, the Workers' Party borrowed R$ 2.4 millions (1,019,230.62 USD) from Marcos Valério. In addition, the documents named José Genoíno (the President of the Workers' Party) and Delúbio Soares (the treasurer). After initially denying that the magazine had taken out this loan, the President of the Workers' Party acknowledged it to journalists on Saturday, July 2.

Delúbio Soares cried during his speech last week and said that the accusations are not true and that the "right" is trying to &lt;a href="w%3Aimpeachment"&gt;impeach&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="w%3ALuiz%20In%C3%A1cio%20Lula%20da%20Silva"&gt;Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva&lt;/a&gt; on false charges.

The testimony of Jefferson is at the center of discussions in Brazil. According to the PMDB leader, Senator Ney Suassuna, the denunciations are "nitroglycerine which are thrown into the arteries of the Republic every minute". Leader of the PSDB, Arthur Virgílio Neto, said that the government lives in darkness. Senator Peter Simon (PMDB-RS) appealed to President Lula to do an ethical turn-around, and respect the imperatives of morality and seriousness in government. According to Simon: "Today society is still saying that president Lula is a man of good. However, shortly, nobody is going to say that anymore".

On July 1, President &lt;a href="w%3ALuiz%20In%C3%A1cio%20Lula%20da%20Silva"&gt;Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva&lt;/a&gt; opened the celebration of the 15th Anniversary of the &lt;a href="w%3AForo%20de%20S%C3%A3o%20Paulo"&gt;Foro de São Paulo&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href="w%3AS%C3%A3o%20Paulo"&gt;São Paulo&lt;/a&gt;. At 7:30 p.m. the forum was opened and, according to the Workers' Party, the participants expressed support for the government of President Lula. Lula spoke during the encounter with the semblance of a tired and worried man affected by the crisis.

It is expected that the government will began a Ministerial reformulation next week.

Thousands of protesters are marching through the streets of Kinshasa demanding that the government resign over delayed elections. They were met by security forces who shot in the air and threw tear-gas grenades.

&lt;a href="Spain%20legalizes%20same-sex%20marriage"&gt;Spain legalizes same-sex marriage&lt;/a&gt;
Spain, a predominantly Catholic country, became the third nation Thursday to legalize same-sex marriage following The Netherlands and Belgium. By a vote of 187-147 with four abstentions, the 350-seat Congress of Deputies approved the measure to give same-sex couples the same rights as heterosexual couples, including the right to adopt children and inherit each others' property.

The World Health Organisation has announced that the number of people receiving anti-retroviral treatments (ART) in developing countries is increasing significantly - more than doubling between December 2003 and June 2005. One million people are now getting the drugs they need, compared to just 400,000 eighteen months ago.

However, access to treatment is not growing as fast as demand, and the UN is unlikely to reach its target of treating three million people by the end of 2005 - just over half the people who need it. The longer-term target of universal treatment by 2010 is still likely to be met.

&lt;a href="United%20States%20Supreme%20Court%20Justice%20O%27Connor%20to%20retire"&gt;United States Supreme Court Justice O'Connor to retire&lt;/a&gt;
United States Supreme Court Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, 75, announced today her intention to retire from the court. She said she would be stepping down before the beginning of the court's fall term, or when the Senate appoints a successor. The last appointment to the Supreme Court was Justice Stephen Breyer more than ten years ago.

&lt;a href="Minnesota%20state%20government%20shuts%20down"&gt;Minnesota state government shuts down&lt;/a&gt;
Nine thousand state employees in the U.S. State of Minnesota were left jobless Friday after state legislators failed to pass a spending bill that would have kept the state government up and running. It is not uncommon for states to miss their budget deadlines, but Minnesota, in contrast to other states, has no law that automatically extends the previous budget if lawmakers fail to approve a new budget. A court order earlier this month requires the state to continue to provide services essential to "health, safety and property."

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Four%20channels%20to%20be%20launched%20on%20Viasat%20in%20the%20Nordic%20and%20Baltic%20countries&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Swedish satellite broadcaster, &lt;a href="w%3AViasat"&gt;Viasat&lt;/a&gt;, has announced that they are about to launch four new channels on their digital platforms in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia this autumn. The channels are &lt;a href="w%3AToon%20Disney"&gt;Toon Disney&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACartoon%20Network"&gt;Cartoon Network&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATCM"&gt;TCM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AE%21"&gt;E!&lt;/a&gt;.

The launch of Toon Disney was announced earlier in 2005. Until August 1, Viasat broadcast the Disney Channel exlusively on satellite. With the launch of Toon Disney, their competitor &lt;a href="w%3ACanal%20Digital"&gt;Canal Digital&lt;/a&gt; is also able to broadcast the Disney Channels.

Cartoon Network and TCM are already available with most of Viasat's comptetitors, but from September 23, Viasat will also broadcast the Turner-owned channels.

The company that broadcast E! in the Nordic countries before decided to rename their channel and get a new franchise. However, E! will re-arrive in the Nordic and Baltic countries on August 1.

A city Circuit Court judge in &lt;a href="w%3ABaltimore"&gt;Baltimore, Maryland&lt;/a&gt;, John M. Glynn, ordered state corrections officials on Friday to produce in 30 days a written report that will outline plans to reduce over crowding and slow processing times at the city's Central Booking and Intake Center. The state-run facility is a centralized jail designed to process arrests made by all city police precincts and is the gateway into the criminal justice system of suspects taken into custody in the city of 640,000 people.

In the last 3 months, over 80 arrestees were released from the Central Booking facility without being formally charged. In April this year, a temporary restaining order was issued by Judge Glynn against the facility to enforce the release of those held more than 24 hours after their intake who did not receive a hearing by a court commissioner. The commissioner sets bail, if granted, and formalizes the charges filed by the arresting officer. The charges are then entered into the state's computer system where the case is tracked. The hearing also marks the date for the suspect’s right to a &lt;a href="w%3Aspeedy%20trial"&gt;speedy trial&lt;/a&gt;.

The Friday hearing was called after the city mayor’s office of &lt;a href="w%3A%20Martin%20O%27Malley%20%28politician%29"&gt;Martin O'Malley&lt;/a&gt; filed a motion to join a lawsuit that was brought by public defenders on behalf of those criminally detained at the facility. In &lt;a href="w%3AMaryland"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt;, a hearing with a court commissioner within 24 hours of being arrested is state law. Judge Glynn presided over that lawsuit which led to the temporary restraining order. The order is to remain in effect until November.

Aides to O’Malley are seeking help from his court to implement and then monitor procedural changes at Central Booking, and made sharp criticisms of state public safety officials. One mayor’s aide said, ”We continue to offer management solutions, and they are accepted. But you know what? I don’t have time to run [Central Booking], nor does the police department.”

Judge Glynn expressed concern during the hearing that a purely judicial remedy may not be the answer, and said, “If I find that it is a hopeless disaster… what can I do about that?” He peppered parties to the suit with questions and suggested there is the possibility that political action, not court intervention, may be needed to solve what city and police officials call inefficient management practices by the state.

Glynn also requested parties to the suit to report back on what happened to the 80+ arrestees who were released so far as a result of the restraining order. The suspect could be re-arrested if officers knew the circumstances of the release, but police say that would take time and money to work out. An arrestee released without seeing a court commissioner has as the only record of the offense the hand written charging document by the officer.

The Maryland attorney general’s office representing the corrections officers said at the hearing that city police are part of the problem by not filing charging documents at Central Booking when the arrestee is delivered and processing begins. The state must accept the prisoners, but cannot move forward without the necessary documents. They also say city police sometimes flood the facility, which can create temporary backlogs.

Central Booking was designed to process 60,000 suspects a year, but currently handles nearly 100,000. It was built to accommodate 900 people at any one time, but normally crowds in 1,200. Arrestees describe conditions in holding cells with no room to sit on the floor, and being crammed in with people who suffer with health problems or drug addicts who vomit from withdrawal.

&lt;a href="w%3AMTV%20Networks"&gt;MTV Networks&lt;/a&gt; launched a new cable channel to 10 million homes Thursday featuring movies, documentaries and original programming targeting the &lt;a href="w%3Alesbian"&gt;lesbian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Agay"&gt;gay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Abisexual"&gt;bisexual&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Atransgender"&gt;transgender&lt;/a&gt; audience becoming the first 24-hour digital cable network offered in the United States on several cable providers and satellite systems.

Logo will present original series, documentaries and specials as well as a library of over 200 lesbian and gay films. The cable channel is also teaming up with CBS News to cover lesbian and gay stories and headlines.

While the channel debuted Thursday, Viacom, the parent comany of Logo, had still not signed licensing agreements with several of the largest cable providers including &lt;a href="w%3AComcast"&gt;Comcast&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACox%20Enterprises"&gt;Cox&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3ADirecTV"&gt;DirecTV&lt;/a&gt; signed a deal Wednesday making Logo available to 13 million households, and &lt;a href="w%3ATime%20Warner"&gt;Time Warner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAtlantic%20Broadband"&gt;Atlantic Broadband&lt;/a&gt; have committed to carry the network.

Advertisers will include Orbitz, Tylenol, &lt;a href="w%3AMotorola"&gt;Motorola&lt;/a&gt;, Miller Lite, Lions Gate Films and Subaru wishing to market to the coveted 25-to-49 age range providing an opportunity to reach out to the lesbian and gay market.

Opposition to the new channel was expected with MSNBC quoting Janice Crouse, senior fellow at &lt;a href="w%3AConcerned%20Women%20for%20America"&gt;Concerned Women for America&lt;/a&gt;, a conservative public-policy women's organization based in Washington, D.C., calling Logo "another example of an assault on children's innocence, a means of legitimizing a homosexual lifestyle, mainstreaming homosexuality in a positive and appealing way."

The &lt;a href="w%3AGay%20%26amp%3B%20Lesbian%20Alliance%20Against%20Defamation"&gt;Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation&lt;/a&gt; (GLAAD) hails the launch of Logo.

"Logo has the potential to reach millions of American television viewers with images and stories that can play a vital role in broadening understanding of our lives, our families and our relationships," says GLAAD Entertainment Media Director Damon Romine. "MTV Networks has a long history of groundbreaking gay and lesbian programming, and devoting an entire network to telling our stories gives us cause to celebrate."

"What these networks provide is something new: an unprecedented opportunity for gays and lesbians to see ourselves depicted as we are, rather than as others see us," Romine says. "At its best, television holds up a mirror to our lives, and the advent of these three networks means that LGBT viewers can now see themselves more accurately and fully reflected in that mirror."

Many have wondered why it took as long as it did to introduce a national LGBT cable channel considering the success of mainstream network shows like "&lt;a href="w%3AWill%20%26amp%3B%20Grace"&gt;Will &amp; Grace&lt;/a&gt;" and "&lt;a href="w%3AQueer%20Eye%20for%20the%20Straight%20Guy"&gt;Queer Eye for the Straight Guy&lt;/a&gt;."

Dragan Paskaš, the president of the Generalštab, the main governing body of the Military of &lt;a href="w%3ASerbia%20and%20Montenegro"&gt;Serbia and Montenegro&lt;/a&gt;, announced that mandatory military service may get shorthened to six months.

So far, every capable male citizen had to serve for nine months in military, or thirteen months in civil service. "I think that mandatory service should last for six months, which would eliminate barriers caused by its length, and we could start new military programs," Paskaš said. 

Military of Serbia and Montenegro has been under a lot of pressure lately, as the government froze Defense Ministry's fundings, and the military has been unable to sell buildings in downtown Belgrade attractive location, which were heavily damaged during NATO bombing in 1999.

Speaking to a group of lawmakers from provinces of &lt;a href="w%3AIranian%20Azerbaijan"&gt;Azerbaijan&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iranian&lt;/a&gt; president-elect &lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud_Ahmadinejad"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt; called "baseless" and "questionable" the controversial spread of photo comparisons of himself to the image of a hostage-taker.

Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman &lt;a href="w%3AHamid%20Reza%20Asefi"&gt;Hamid Reza Asefi&lt;/a&gt;, said during a interview with Alison Caldwell on ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20World%20Today"&gt;The World Today&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ on Sunday that, "Mr. Ahmadinejad's involvement in the US Embassy takeover was a lie, which was even confirmed by the Americans. That was evidently propaganda. We should be aware and not let such propaganda lead us to misunderstanding and pessimism."

Former secret agent &lt;a href="w%3ASaeed%20Hajjarian"&gt;Saeed Hajjarian&lt;/a&gt;, a one-time top adviser to outgoing President &lt;a href="w%3AMohammad%20Khatami"&gt;Mohammad Khatami&lt;/a&gt;, identified the man in a 1979 photo as Taqi Mohammadi, who was jailed in 1981 for his involvement in bombing that killed the president and prime minister in Tehran. According to a story in the ♡❤&lt;a href="http%3A//www.aljazeerah.info/News%2520archives/2005%2520News%2520Archives/July/3n/Hostagetaker%2520was%2520not%2520Ahmadinejad%2520aide.htm"&gt;Jordan Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, "Mohammadi committed suicide in Evin prison. I myself was a witness to take his body out of jail for burial," Hajjarian said. 

Many top news sources reported that Ahmadinejad was believed by 5 former hostages of the &lt;a href="w%3AIran_hostage_crisis"&gt;1981 hostage crisis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ATehran"&gt;Teheran&lt;/a&gt; to be one of the hostage-takers or interrogators of that incident. Two images have been used commonly across the media on this topic. The first, a known picture of Ahmadinejad during his student days and the second an image of one of the hostagetakers, both in black and white. One or both of these images have been placed side-by-side on a number of current images of the president in most news media.
♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AFOX%20News"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ chose to enlarge features of the known student photo of Ahmadinejad alongside current photos of himself, i.e. comparing his nose and eyes with the same features on himself. To no great surprise, the similarity is striking.

Currently, U.S. officials find "serious discrepancies" between images of the Ahmadinejad and the mentioned images of the terrorist.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Karl%20Rove%20named%20as%20a%20source%20of%20Plame%20leak&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A reporter's notes subpoenaed by the U.S. District Court in Washington may show &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;'s chief political advisor &lt;a href="Karl%20Rove"&gt;Karl Rove&lt;/a&gt; as one of the two sources behind the leaking of the identity of undercover &lt;a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; agent &lt;a href="Valerie%20Plame"&gt;Valerie Plame&lt;/a&gt;, according to one or more anonymous sources cited by MSNBC. 

However, Rove's lawyer, Donald Luskin, acknowledged that although Rove had communicated with Cooper shortly before Plame's identity was leaked, denied any wrongdoing on the part of his client, saying that "Rove absolutely did not identify Valerie Plame."

The notes are those of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATIME%20magazine"&gt;TIME magazine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; White House correspondent &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMatthew%20Cooper"&gt;Matthew Cooper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . They were released by Norman Pearlstine, editor-in-chief of TIME Inc., by order of the court, in ruling that, in the case of leaking the identity of CIA agents, reporters must reveal the identity of their sources.

The court's ruling was based on the clause in Constitutional law summarized popularly with the phrase "Crying fire in a crowded theater": that when the degree to which the speech puts the safety of others at risk outweighs the degree to which it benefits others, so does their right to safety and security outweigh one's right to free expression. 

The Supreme Court on Monday refused to hear the reporters' appeal of the case.

<h3>Background</h3>
♡❤TIME♡❤ magazine announced Thursday they would identify the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; leak from reporter Matthew Cooper's notes. The decision by ♡❤TIME♡❤ came after a federal judge in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; gave the magazine and ♡❤&lt;a href="The%20New%20York%20Times"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ 48 hours to comply with a months long order to provide information on the sources of press leaks. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJudith%20Miller%20%28journalist%29"&gt;Judith Miller&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of ♡❤The New York Times♡❤, along with Cooper at ♡❤TIME♡❤, face jail time for their refusal to name anonymous sources. The steadfast refusal by Cooper and Miller to personally identify their sources may lead to an 18 month jail sentence.

The case against Cooper stemmed from a July 6, 2003 Op-Ed piece published by the ♡❤Times♡❤, where &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJoseph%20C.%20Wilson"&gt;Joseph C. Wilson IV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; disputed the assertion made by President Bush in his &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AState%20of%20the%20Union%20Address"&gt;State of the Union Address&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that &lt;a href="Saddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt; tried to buy uranium from &lt;a href="Niger"&gt;Niger&lt;/a&gt;.

A week later Valerie Plame, Wilson's wife, was identified as a CIA operative in a news story written by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20D.%20Novak"&gt;Robert D. Novak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a conservative pundit. The news blew Plame's cover, and the information was obtained by two anonymous White House sources. The leak to the press was thought by some to be retaliation for her husband's Op-Ed story. Wilson blamed Rove for the leak, saying in an Aug. 21, 2003 public panel, "At the end of the day, it's of keen interest to me to see whether or not we can get Karl Rove frog-marched out of the White House in handcuffs. And trust me, when I use that name, I measure my words." &lt;a href="http%3A//www.pacificviews.org/archives/000094.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Cooper wrote and had published stories about the issue at ♡❤TIME♡❤. Miller did research, but did not write a story. The reporter Novak who broke the story, remained silent on the case until Wednesday, and said on &lt;a href="CNN"&gt;♡❤CNN♡❤&lt;/a&gt;'s ♡❤Inside Politics♡❤ that, "They're not going to jail because of me."

Journalists usually protect their sources' wishes of anonymity, in order to retain a vital channel of information from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWhistleblower"&gt;whistle-blowers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and others with controversial information. The tension between the press and the U.S. Federal judiciary highlights what Rick Rodriquez, executive director of the American Association of Newspaper Editors, calls "the need to have a discussion around the federal shield law." A "shield" &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Astatute"&gt;statute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; could grant confidentiality between reporters and anonymous sources similarly to the right granted in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAttorney/client%20privilege"&gt;attorney-client privilege&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The decision by his employer ♡❤TIME♡❤ to reveal a source may spare veteran reporter Cooper time behind bars. His employer is in possession of his notes and therefore has knowledge of the source. In the case of Miller, ♡❤The New York Times♡❤ claims it has no such reporting notes.

Massive music concerts took place around the planet under the &lt;a href="w%3ALive%208"&gt;Live 8&lt;/a&gt; banner in an effort to put pressure on the leaders of the eight richest countries in the world to end global poverty.

All concerts were timed to take place between noon and 10pm local time, with over a million people expected to attend concerts in &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;. The events were broadcast to a potential audience of five and a half billion people world-wide.

The largest concert was in the US in &lt;a href="w%3APhiladelphia"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt; where, over the course of 7 hours, hundreds of thousands of people gathered to watch &lt;a href="w%3AStevie%20Wonder"&gt;Stevie Wonder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AKanye%20West"&gt;Kanye West&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADestiny%27s%20Child"&gt;Destiny's Child&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADave%20Matthews%20Band"&gt;Dave Matthews Band&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ABlack%20Eyed%20Peas"&gt;Black Eyed Peas&lt;/a&gt; among others. Philadelphia native &lt;a href="w%3AWill%20Smith"&gt;Will Smith&lt;/a&gt; both performed and was the opening presenter. Peak attendance, the maximum amount of people believed to be watching Live 8 on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway at a given time, is estimated to have been between 600,000 and 800,000.

In &lt;a href="w%3AHyde%20Park"&gt;Hyde Park&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, 205,000 people watched acts including &lt;a href="w%3AElton%20John"&gt;Elton John&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMadonna"&gt;Madonna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AColdplay"&gt;Coldplay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARobbie%20Williams"&gt;Robbie Williams&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APink%20Floyd"&gt;Pink Floyd&lt;/a&gt;. The concert was opened by &lt;a href="w%3ASir%20Paul%20McCartney"&gt;Sir Paul McCartney&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AU2"&gt;U2&lt;/a&gt; playing Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band - the first time the song has ever been performed live by a &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Beatles"&gt;Beatle&lt;/a&gt;. It ended at 11.58pm with all of the acts coming on stage to sing one last time.

&lt;a href="Bill%20Gates"&gt;Bill Gates&lt;/a&gt; - founder of &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; and the richest man in the world (owning $46.5 billion) - appeared on the London stage to discuss the challenges facing the world, before introducing &lt;a href="w%3ADido%20%28singer%29"&gt;Dido&lt;/a&gt;. Later, &lt;a href="w%3AKofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt;, the Secretary-General of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; addressed the audience, thanking them for their support.

However, the first concert to open - in Japan - only drew 10,000 spectators, disappointing many.

The concerts follow on 20 years after the &lt;a href="w%3ALive%20Aid"&gt;Live Aid&lt;/a&gt; concert organised by &lt;a href="Bob%20Geldof"&gt;Bob Geldof&lt;/a&gt;, which was created to raise money for famine victims in &lt;a href="w%3AEthopia"&gt;Ethopia&lt;/a&gt;.

By contrast, the aim of Live 8 - also organised by Geldof - is not fund-raising but instead to apply pressure to the leaders of the G8 to end world poverty, which claims the lives of 50,000 every day.

The Live 8 organisers are urging the G8 to:

<ol>
BULLET::::1. Double the aid sent to the world's poorest countries,
BULLET::::2. Fully cancel their debts,
BULLET::::3. Change the trade laws so that they can build their own future.

</ol>
The Finance Ministers of the G8 &lt;a href="G8%20finance%20ministers%20agree%20on%20deal%20to%20relieve%20debts%20of%2018%20poorest%20nations"&gt;agreed a plan&lt;/a&gt; last month to cancel the debt of 18 of the poorest countries to the IMF, the World Bank and the African Development Fund, but are requiring other countries to end political and financial corruption before they become elegible for debt relief.

On Thursday the President of the United States, &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;, announced that the US will double US aid to &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; by 2010 - increasing to $8.6 billion a year. Bob Geldof welcomed the news, saying "This is the first time we have heard this sort of language. 

"This is very, very positive indeed."

This was all Afrcan musicians plus Dido, guesting with Senegalese superstar Youssou N'Dour.

The Eden centre turned out to be an excellent site for TV or rather a web stream.

WOMAD was involved so there may be a record.

There was a weblink to South Africa and a live message from Nelson Mandela.

Musician &lt;a href="w%3ALuther%20Vandross"&gt;Luther Vandross&lt;/a&gt; died at 1:47 pm Eastern time Friday, at a hospital in Edison, New Jersey, likely from complications related to a 2003 stroke.

He was the winner of numerous &lt;a href="w%3AGrammy%20Award"&gt;Grammy Award&lt;/a&gt;s.

&lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20Truex%20Jr."&gt;Martin Truex Jr.&lt;/a&gt; was welcomed with a firework celebration into Gatorade Victory Lane at &lt;a href="w%3ADaytona%20International%20Speedway"&gt;Daytona International Speedway&lt;/a&gt; late Friday night as the winner of the &lt;a href="w%3ANASCAR"&gt;NASCAR&lt;/a&gt; Busch series Winn-Dixie 250 race. Truex Jr. lead for most of the race, first taking the lead position at lap 21.

Four fighter jets from the Connecticut Air National Guard flew over the track after the national anthem, a NASCAR tradition for races.

The race got off to a rocky start for some, such as the #64 car driven by &lt;a href="w%3AJeremy%20Mayfield"&gt;Jeremy Mayfield&lt;/a&gt; pit early twice, once on lap four and another one lap after. On lap 13, the #60 car driven by Carl Edwards spun through the grass near Turns 1 and 2 after being hit by Truex Jr, sending the race into a caution.

Truex Jr. fought for the lead on lap 21 with his car owner &lt;a href="w%3ADale%20Earnhardt%20Jr."&gt;Dale Earnhardt Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, where Truex passed Earnhardt on the high end of Turn 4. Earnhardt would later slip back to the third position two laps later.

Lap 37 started with a smoking run into the pits by Kyle Krisiloff and his #5 car after a break malfunction, which led to him exceeding the speed limit placed by NASCAR on pit road. Seven laps later, JJ Yaley's #18 car stalled on the track and coasted into the garage.

Nextel cup veteran driver &lt;a href="w%3ASterling%20Marlin"&gt;Sterling Marlin&lt;/a&gt;'s front right tire gave out on lap 56, sending the race into yet another caution for the night. The race was then silent until lap 78, when Earnhardt came into contact with driver Paul Menard of the #11 car coming off turn 4, causing Earnhardt to spin. Earnhardt did not return to the race after the incident, believed to be the cause of a broken transmission from the spin. A caution was issued.

It would be 10 laps until another caution would be issued, this time for the rookie Michel Jourdain Jr. in his #10 car, after he spins after coming in contact with two other cars. After the caution, a three-car leadership of &lt;a href="w%3AGreg%20Biffle"&gt;Greg Biffle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Harvick"&gt;Kevin Harvick&lt;/a&gt; and Truex Jr. would lead the remainder of the race, with each of them taking a turn leading.

A major crash caused by #34, driven by Randy LaJoie, resulted in an 8-car pileup along the backstretch on lap 97, sending the race into its final caution of the night. A red flag was issued on lap 99, freezing the field of any movement or alterations with the cars. The race finally resumed almost 20 minutes later, with a green-white-checkered finish led by Truex Jr.

The &lt;a href="w%3AItar-Tass"&gt;Itar-Tass&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Anews%20agency"&gt;news agency&lt;/a&gt; reports that an explosion in the southern &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n town of &lt;a href="Makhachkala"&gt;Makhachkala&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Dagestan"&gt;Dagestan&lt;/a&gt;, has killed 10 soldiers and wounded 20 others on Friday. Two bombs were set off in a &lt;a href="w%3Abath%20house"&gt;bath house&lt;/a&gt; at 2:15 pm local time as the soldiers were passing outside, according to an official of the Russian Interior Ministry. Dagestan borders &lt;a href="Chechnya"&gt;Chechnya&lt;/a&gt;, which has a long history of uprisings against Russian rule. The current insurrection started at the time of the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1990.

Ujjal Dosanjh, Canada's Minister of Health, has set out a plan to stop U.S. cities and states from purchasing drugs in bulk from Canadian suppliers. The plan is being criticized as potentially destroying a number of mail order and internet-based pharmacies operating in Canada that ship prescription drugs to the United States. It is said the result may simply cause orders to shift to suppliers in the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, as well as possibly Mexico.

After two days of reviews, NASA managers have scheduled shuttle Discovery for a launch attempt at 1951 UTC or 3:51 p.m. local time in Florida, on July 13. Additional paperwork must be settled, as well as issues regarding the shuttle's body flap, a device that assists in descent at re-entry. If all goes well and the launch takes place on schedule, this will be the 114th launch of the Space shuttle.

U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson of San Francisco has ordered the state's health care system for prisoners be put under the control of a receiver to stop deaths of inmates due to medical malfeasance. The system provides medical care to 164,000 inmates at a cost of US$1.1 billion annually. Reportedly the judge described conditions in the state's medical system as barbaric. The appointment of a receiver was the last resort available after repeated failures of Governor Schwartenegger's administration to improve medical conditions at state prisons.

Britain's National Gallery revealed on Friday that by X-raying one of Leonardo Da Vinci's paintings, "Virgin of the Rocks", they have found a drawing beneath the surface of the painting. The drawing is of a woman who is raising her arm and looking downcast. The drawing had been previously dismissed as a mere copy of a similar drawing that is hanging in Paris' Louvre museum.

The China National Offshore Oil Company,(CNOOC), has submitted to U.S. Government regulators the details of its proposed US$18.5 billion purchase of California-based Unocal. The bid comes against a US$16.5 billion offer of cash and stock from Chevron Corporation. CNOOC, which is 70% owned by the Chinese Government, has placed a request for review with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS. Both Chevron and CNOOC have been readying their lobbyists to try and get favorable consideration for their side in Washington. If there is determined to be no threat to national security as a result of the merger, the review of CNOOC's offer could be completed in as little as 30 days. While typically such reviews are not undertaken until after a takeover bid is formally accepted by the target companty, there is precedent for such review to be done before that happens.

A grandfather and his grandson have died off the coast of North Wales, UK, after their sailing dinghy was overwhelmed and capsized in rough seas. They were with a party of four who had been angling from a 4.6 m boat.

At 4pm local time on Saturday the Holyhead Coastguard received an emergency call from the ♡❤Star Reader♡❤ saying they had found a capsized dinghy adrift three and a half miles north of Puffin Island, off the east coast of the Isle of Anglesey.

A third vessel, the ♡❤Sara Jane♡❤, also attended the scene to allow a first aider on board to render assistance.

A RAF search and rescue helicopter was scrambled and the Beaumaris lifeboat launched to effect a rescue effort. Two people were found clinging to the boat but two more had been washed away. A rapid search recovered both of them.

The rescue helicopter lowered its winchman onto the dinghy to begin CPR on the nine year old boy before he was winched onboard. He was flown to nearby Bangor Hospital, but later died.

The Beaumaris lifeboat raced the grandfather - also suffering serious hypothermia - ashore to a waiting ambulance, but he too died shortly afterwards. The lifeboat also carried an uninjured member of the party ashore, while the helicopter returned to rescue a second young boy.

The father and a twelve year old boy survived. All had been wearing life jackets, but the sea was running at 1.5 m waves in a 45 km/h wind at the time. 

It is believed the two dead had been in the water for at least three hours before they were recovered, and died from the effects of hypothermia.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; decided on Friday to indefinitely retain control the 13 &lt;a href="w%3ARoot%20nameserver"&gt;root servers&lt;/a&gt; that direct all &lt;a href="w%3AInternet"&gt;internet&lt;/a&gt; traffic to the right locations. This decision drew concern from foreign officials who would rather see an international group such as &lt;a href="w%3AICANN"&gt;ICANN&lt;/a&gt; oversee the control of the servers. 

David Gross, a U.S. ambassador and the coordinator for international communications and information policies of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20State"&gt;US State Department&lt;/a&gt;, insists that the announcement was not related to &lt;a href="w%3AU.N."&gt;U.N.&lt;/a&gt; discussions. He also said other countries should see the move as positive because "uncertainty is not something that we think is in the United States' interest or the world's interest."

This decision reverses a statement made by the United States in 1998 in which they said would hand power over to ICANN after meeting a number of set conditions. A spokesman said that the declaration was in response to growing security threats and global communications and to the fact that commerce is becoming more reliant on the Internet. 

"There have been strong opinions that essentially allowing the United States alone to check this process is not right given the nature of the internet today," said Masahiko Fujimoto of the &lt;a href="w%3AMinistry%20of%20Internal%20Affairs%20and%20Communications"&gt;Japanese Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications&lt;/a&gt;, who also said the decision is likely to alienate many in the international community. A worst-case scenario could see countries refusing to accept U.S. control of the root servers leading to a separate set of networks. 

This means that people typing the same &lt;a href="w%3AURL"&gt;URL&lt;/a&gt; in different locations could see an entirely different website in their browsers. This announcement came several weeks before a &lt;a href="w%3AU.N."&gt;U.N.&lt;/a&gt; panel releases a report on Internet governance which addresses issues including control of root servers.

According to ♡❤&lt;a href="USA%20Today"&gt;USA Today&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ report, &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Department%20of%20Defense"&gt;U.S. Defense department&lt;/a&gt; numbers show that 882 U.S. troops died in the 12 months through June 30th, 2005. This is a 34.2% increase from 657 killed in the preceding 12 months.

This figure does not include those troops who died during transportation out of Iraq.

These figures come amidst rising concerns among American citizens, reflected by poll numbers, and their release by the Defense department is contemporaneous with Bush's recent speech rallying the war.

Veteran &lt;a href="w%3ANASCAR"&gt;NASCAR&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ANextel%20Cup"&gt;Nextel Cup&lt;/a&gt; driver &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Stewart"&gt;Tony Stewart&lt;/a&gt; dominated the &lt;a href="w%3APepsi%20400"&gt;Pepsi 400&lt;/a&gt; night race at &lt;a href="w%3ADaytona%20International%20Speedway"&gt;Daytona International Speedway&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ADaytona%20Beach%2C%20Florida"&gt;Daytona Beach, Florida&lt;/a&gt; early Sunday morning, winning his first ever race at a &lt;a href="w%3ARestrictor%20plates"&gt;restrictor plate&lt;/a&gt; track.

A rain delay halted the cars from hitting the track until around 0230 UTC time Sunday, with &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Defense"&gt;Secretary of Defense&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADonald%20Rumsfeld"&gt;Donald Rumsfeld&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;a href="w%3AGrand%20Marshal"&gt;grand marshal&lt;/a&gt;. Green flag racing started around lap 10, with Stewart on the pole position.

Lap 34 gave way to the first caution of the night when the #6 car, driven by &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Martin"&gt;Mark Martin&lt;/a&gt;, swerved to attempt to avoid an accident. The car first skimmed the side of the barrier coming off Turn 4, then later raced into lower ground, causing a multi-car pileup and sending the race into a caution.

The next caution came at lap 64, when a small piece of debris was cleaned up on the track. Just four laps later, &lt;a href="w%3AKyle%20Petty"&gt;Kyle Petty&lt;/a&gt; in the #45 car blew a tire and sent the race into another caution. On the next green lap another four laps later, &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Waltrip"&gt;Michael Waltrip&lt;/a&gt; and the #15 car lost an engine. On the same lap, 2003 Pepsi 400 winner &lt;a href="w%3AGreg%20Biffle"&gt;Greg Biffle&lt;/a&gt; in the #16 car lost a tire. Another caution was issued.

On Lap 145, another multi-car crash happened off turn four, heading to the start/finish line. The race was finally restarted at lap 151, with Stewart leading all remaining laps.

Instead of usually celebrating on the infield between pit lane and the track, Stewart chose to climb a flag pole near the start/finish line to celebrate his victory. Fireworks, a tradition of the Pepsi 400, sounded at the end of the race and continued for more than 20 minutes after the race's finish.

Younis Mohammad Ibrahim al-Hayyari, who was believed to be one of the top leaders of Al-Qaeda, died after exchanging fire and hurling hand grenades at Saudi Arabian police in Riyadh. Hayyari's name was at the top of a list of 36 al Qaeda suspects announced by Riyadh last week. The ministry of the Interior said he had helped prepare explosives and had played a part in several attacks on targets there.

Saudi Arabia has been battling suspected al Qaida militants for two years since May 2003, when they launched their campaign of violence with triple suicide bombings at expatriate housing compounds in the Riyadh. Successive leaders of the Saudi wing of al Qaida have been killed since 2003 and Saudi officials say their replacements are increasingly inexperienced. But Western counterterrorism experts say al Qaida has shown a resilience and ability to regenerate.

Karla Homolka has transfixed Canada since she helped her husband drug, rape, torture, videotape and kill two teenage girls and cause the death of her own sister. Homolka, 35, will be released sometime before Tuesday after serving the full sentence of 12 years in prison for manslaughter. According to press accounts of her childhood, Homolka was just 17, a bright 11th-grader, when she met Paul Bernardo, 23, a charming and handsome man, in 1987. Bernardo would ultimately be found by police to be a serial rapist, with sometime assistance from Homolka. Homolka struck a bargain with prosecutors to plead guilty to two counts of manslaughter and testify against her husband, and fears she will be the target of vigilantes angry about what many Canadians consider the "deal with the devil" that's to blame for her imminent release.

&lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan's&lt;/a&gt; coastguard reported Sunday that an underwater volcano had erupted in the eastern &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Ocean"&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt;, about 1400 kilometers south of &lt;a href="w%3ATokyo"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;. A plume of steam, rising more than 1100 meters into the air, was spotted by Japanese troops on &lt;a href="w%3AIwo%20Jima"&gt;Iwo Jima&lt;/a&gt;. Iwo Jima is located about 48 kilometers from the eruption.
Airborne Japanese officials and coastguard aircraft crews reported the water appeared brick-red. The survey crew also reported a grey, mud-like substance rising from the bottom. Video footage was taken. 
The last undersea eruption in the area was in 1986 and lasted three days.

It is believed that magnetic resonance spectroscopy can detect genetic flaws which are an almost certain guarantee that the person will develop Alzheimer's disease later in life. Scientists have also used positron emission tomography, or PET scans to see if Alzheimer's disease developed in some of the test subjects. Another study determined that blood levels of a protein called amyloid beta 42 drops three to five years before a patient was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. It was also found that Japanese-Americans who drank the most fruit and vegetable juice had a fourfold lower risk of developing Alzheimer’s, while one researcher found that moderate drinkers had a lower risk of Alzheimer’s than either non-drinkers or heavy drinkers.

The trip was completely flown in a replica &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVickers%20Vimy"&gt;Vickers Vimy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a type of &lt;a href="World%20War%20One"&gt;World War One&lt;/a&gt; bomber.

Mohamed al-Sumaidaie, &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq's&lt;/a&gt; ambassador to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, accused U.S. marines of murdering his cousin's 21-year-old son, Mohammed Sumaidaie, who was studying engineering at the University of Technology in Baghdad. “All indications point to a killing of an unarmed innocent civilian - a cold-blooded murder,” said Sumaidaie. “The Marines were smiling at each other as they were leaving.”

Sumaidaie called for an investigation of the alleged June 25 killing of the student while the US military said the charges “roughly correspond to an incident involving coalition forces on that day in that general location.” U.S.-led forces were conducting a sweep in the western portion of &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Anbar"&gt;Anbar&lt;/a&gt;, in the province of Sumaidaie's ancestral villiage.

Sumaidaie said the “Americans come and rough up the youths in the village demanding information which they simply do not have,”

The alleged victim was at his father’s house with his mother when marines knocked at the door the ambassador said, quoting the young man's mother. According to Sumaidaie's letter, the Marines asked if there were any weapons, and Mohammed said there was a rifle, which only had blanks. He then led some of the Marines into his father's bedroom where it was kept. The younger brother of the dead student was dragged by his hair into a corridor and beaten while the rest of the family was told to wait outside, he said.

After waiting for more than an hour on the porch, the marines left, and the victim's mother found her son dead with a bullet to the neck, according to Sumaidaie.

"The mother let off a deafening cry of anguish but the marines were smiling at each other as they were leaving," Sumaidaie said. "In the bedroom, Mohamed was found dead and laying in a clotted pool of his blood."

U.S. Maj. Gen. Stephen T. Johnson said, "We take these allegations seriously and will thoroughly investigate this incident to determine what happened."

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADeep%20Impact%20%28space%20mission%29"&gt;Deep Impact&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ probe collided with the comet &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A9P/Tempel%201"&gt;Tempel 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on Monday, as intended by scientists. The collision took place at 5:45 UTC and NASA held a press briefing shortly after at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJet%20Propulsion%20Laboratory"&gt;Jet Propulsion Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (JPL) in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APasadena%2C%20California"&gt;Pasadena&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , NASA's non-manned space flight control center. A full-fledged press conference by NASA is scheduled to be at JPL on Monday afternoon at 2 p.m. PDT (9:00 UTC).

The experiment, intending to provide more information about the make up of comets, consisted of a 370&amp;nbsp;kg projectile being fired at the comet in order to observe and analyse the resultant impact. With information gleaned from the impact, the comet's general make-up can be established and more accurate hypotheses regarding how the Solar system and the universe came to be.

<h2>Background</h2>
Deep Impact is a NASA space probe designed to study the composition of the interior of a comet. Previous space missions to comets, such as Giotto and Stardust, were merely fly-by missions, only able to photograph and examine the surfaces of cometary nuclei. The Deep Impact mission will be the first to examine a cometary interior, and thus, scientists hope, reveal new secrets about these small frozen bodies.

<h3>Mission profile</h3>
Following its launch on January 12, 2005, the ♡❤Deep Impact♡❤ spacecraft took 174 days to reach Comet Tempel 1 at a cruising speed of 103,000 kilometers per hour (64,000 miles per hour). Once the spacecraft reached the vicinity of the comet on July 3, 2005, it separated into two portions, an impactor and a flyby probe. The impactor used its thrusters to move into the path of the comet, impacting 24 hours later at a relative speed of 37,000 kilometers per hour. The impactor has a mass of 370 kilograms and approached Tempel 1 with a relative speed of 10.30 kilometers per second (6.3 miles per second), thus delivering 1.96 &amp;times; 10 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ajoule"&gt;joules&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Akinetic%20energy"&gt;kinetic energy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the equivalent of 4.5 tons of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATrinitrotoluene"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Scientists believe that the energy of this high-velocity collision will be sufficient to excavate a crater up to 100 meters wide (larger than the bowl of the Roman &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AColosseum"&gt;Colosseum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ), although the crater has not yet been spotted in post-impact images because the cloud of debris is obscuring the view. 

Just minutes after the impact, the flyby probe passed by the nucleus at a close distance of 500 km, taking pictures of the crater position, the ejecta plume, and the entire cometary nucleus. The entire event was photographed by Earth-based telescopes and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20observatory"&gt;orbital observatories&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , such as the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHubble%20Space%20Telescope"&gt;Hubble&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChandra%20X-ray%20Observatory"&gt;Chandra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASpitzer%20Space%20Telescope"&gt;Spitzer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AXMM-Newton"&gt;XMM-Newton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . In addition, the impact was observed by cameras and spectroscopes on board Europe's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARosetta%20space%20probe"&gt;Rosetta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; spacecraft, which was about 80 million km from the comet at the time of impact. Rosetta should determine the composition of the gas and dust cloud kicked up by the impact. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMCOZ1DU8E_index_0.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The total Deep Impact mission cost is US$330 million.

<h3>Scientific goals</h3>
The Deep Impact mission will help answer fundamental questions about comets, such as:
<ul>
BULLET::::- Is the composition of a cometary nucleus the same throughout, or has some physical process caused the interior to become differentiated from the surface? In other words, is the nucleus layered?
BULLET::::- Are cometary nuclei highly cohesive and tightly-packed, or porous conglomerates?
BULLET::::- Do any parts of a cometary nucleus contain pristine material that have been untouched since the creation of the comet during the Solar System's early history?
</ul>
Scientists hope that these questions will be answered, at least in part, by data from the Deep Impact mission. For example, the size and shape of the crater produced by the impact will tell scientists how well-packed the cometary material is.

Russian &lt;a href="w%3Aastrology"&gt;astrologist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMarina%20Bai"&gt;Marina Bai&lt;/a&gt; has filed suit in &lt;a href="w%3AMoscow"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt; asking for 8.7 billion rubles (311 million U.S. dollars) because, she claims, the &lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADeep%20Impact"&gt;Deep Impact&lt;/a&gt; mission damaged her business by altering her ability to provide accurate &lt;a href="w%3Ahoroscope"&gt;horoscope&lt;/a&gt;s, harmed her "system of spiritual values," and will "interfere with the natural life of the universe."

"It is obvious that elements of the comet's orbit, and correspondingly the ephemeris, will change after the explosion, which interferes with my astrology work and distorts my horoscope," Bai was quoted in the daily newspaper, ♡❤Izvestia.♡❤

NASA has refuted similar accusations by pointing out that this impact is only a new addition to many previous collisions already on the comet.

On July 4, NASA &lt;a href="NASA%27s%20Deep%20Impact%20probe%20strikes%20comet%20successfully"&gt;successfully crashed a probe&lt;/a&gt; into the comet in hopes the debris kicked up in the resulting explosion could shed light in the building blocks of the early solar system.

The lawsuit, originally filed in June, has not yet been scheduled for an initial hearing, according to Russian authorities.
