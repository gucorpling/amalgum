Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, &lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;BRAZIL&lt;/a&gt; – 
This morning about 500 policemen occupied the Morro da Rocinha, a &lt;a href="w%3Afavela"&gt;favela&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ARio%20de%20Janeiro"&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt;. The action is a part of a police operation against &lt;a href="w%3Adrug"&gt;drug&lt;/a&gt; dealers.

Police say they recovered 11 previously stolen motorcycles, a grenade, a fusil, a walkie-talkie and fireworks (the criminals usually use fireworks to warn fellows about the arrival of police). Three men suspected of drug dealing were arrested: Fernando Pereira Lima (aged 22) Alessandro Martins (aged 27) and a boy (aged 17 - Brazilian laws forbid the release of names of teenagers younger than 18 in reporting legal cases). The teenager allegedly shot the grenade against the policemen, but was himself hurt. He is stable after treatment at the Miguel Couto hospital.

The drug dealers from Morro da Rocinha are in a war against drug dealers from the neighboring Vidigal favela. Local populations of both Morro da Rocinha and Vidigal are endangered by the criminals, and have demanded urgent actions by the authorities.

&lt;a href="%3Aw%3AMetrorex"&gt;Metrorex&lt;/a&gt;, the operator of the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABucharest%20Metro"&gt;Bucharest Metro&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARomania"&gt;Romania's&lt;/a&gt; capital, has signed a US$144 million contract with &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABombardier"&gt;Bombardier&lt;/a&gt; for the delivery of 20 additional six-car metro trains for the network. This marks the second phase of the Bucharest Metro's modernisation, the first being the order of 108 state-of-the-art trainsets from Bombadier in 1999. The first series of trainsets were put into operation in 2002 and currently operate on Line 2 of the metro. The second order, signed on January 18, 2005, will ensure that, by 2006, the Bombadier trainsets will service all four lines of the network, transforming the Bucharest Metro into one of the most modern systems in Europe.

The parts for the cars will be produced in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;, with the final assembly taking place in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ACraiova"&gt;Craiova&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARomania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;.

Since 1999, the Bucharest Metro, which is the largest urban rail system in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABalkans"&gt;southeastern Europe&lt;/a&gt;, has embarked on a comprehensive modernisation campaign. Marius Lapadat, the general director of Metrorex, claims that "residents and visitors... are impressed with these new state-of-the-art trains", referring to the 108 Bombadier trainsets already running on Line 2 of the network. 

This second order is expected to further consolidate the Metro's image as a modern and convenient way of travelling, especially since line extensions are being constructed presently. Lapadat also stated that, "The metro provides a modern feel to Bucharest which is important for our economic future." In early 2003, Metrorex ordered new traffic control and interlocking systems worth US$14 million from Bombardier.

The modernisation programme for the Bucharest Metro, including the order for new trainsets, is funded equally by Metrorex and the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEuropean%20Investment%20Bank"&gt;European Investment Bank&lt;/a&gt;, each contributing 50% to the entire sum.

Diplomats at the Trade Representation of the Russian embassy have for a number of years operated at least 8 brothels in the Finnish capital.
The police investigation, which has just been completed, revealed that the diplomats were planning to expand their operation. They even planned to open a large hotel. 

About 100 Russian prostitutes worked at the brothels, and the diplomats are known to have pocketed more than $200,000. The police have not been able to interrogate the diplomats because of their diplomatic immunity. They left Finland soon after the police investigation began last spring.

Several prominent &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARomania"&gt;Romanian&lt;/a&gt; artists and celebrities will gather at the Radio Hall in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABucharest"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday, January 23, to raise money for the victims of the catastrophic &lt;a href="%3Aw%3A2004%20Indian%20Ocean%20earthquake"&gt;Indian Ocean tsunami&lt;/a&gt; of December 26, 2004. In an event titled ♡❤Romanian Artists in Support of Asia♡❤, organised by The Reporter Foundation of Romania, artists will auction off their works, as well as personal objects, with all proceeds being donated to the relief efforts for the tsunami victims.

Media celebrities such as the soprano Felicia Filip and singers Angela Similea and Dida Dragan will also be participating, as well as &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AMaia%20Morgenstern"&gt;Maia Morgenstern&lt;/a&gt;, known internationally for her role in the film ♡❤&lt;a href="%3Aw%3AThe%20Passion%20of%20the%20Christ"&gt;The Passion of the Christ&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. All ambassadors accredited in Bucharest, as well as political personalities, have been invited to participate.

♡❤Romanian Artists in Support of Asia♡❤ is the second major public event organised in Romania to support the victims of the recent Indian Ocean disaster. On Sunday, January 16, the Romanian public raised the equivalent of 395,000 euro in a &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Atelethon"&gt;telethon&lt;/a&gt;, while the Romanian Government pledged 150,000 euro for the relief effort.

The artistic event is also part of a campaign by the Bucharest City Hall that seeks to relaunch the image of the Romanian capital as a creative and colourful metropolis. The city will be the first in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABalkans"&gt;southeastern Europe&lt;/a&gt; to host &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ACowParade"&gt;CowParade&lt;/a&gt;, the world's largest public art event, between June and August this year.

Full approval from the Senate is necessary before Rice can take the job.

Democrats have refused to waive the one-day delay between nomination and a Senate vote in order to analyse thoroughly Dr. Rice's testimony to the Foreign Relations Committee. The Senate vote is expected to take place next week.

Several Democratic senators posed tough challenges to Rice during the hearings.

"I'm worried about your lack of candor, and I'm giving you a chance to set the record straight," said Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA).

Brazilian President &lt;a href="w%3ALuiz%20In%C3%A1cio%20Lula%20da%20Silva"&gt;Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva&lt;/a&gt; travelled to the Colombian city of Leticia, in the &lt;a href="w%3ATres%20Fronteras"&gt;triborder&lt;/a&gt; region, where he met with Colombian President &lt;a href="w%3A%C3%81lvaro%20Uribe"&gt;Alvaro Uribe&lt;/a&gt;. They discussed the crisis between &lt;a href="w%3AColombia"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AVenezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;. 

The crisis began after the arrest of the &lt;a href="w%3ARevolutionary%20Armed%20Forces%20of%20Colombia"&gt;FARC&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href="w%3ARodrigo%20Granda"&gt;Rodrigo Granda&lt;/a&gt;, also known as Ricardo Gonzalez. Venezuela argued that Granda's arrest is illegal and that Colombia invaded Venezuelan territory in the course of the arrest. Colombia, in turn, claimed the arrest occurred inside Colombian territory and accused Venezuela of harboring terrorists.

Lula and Uribe did not say very much publicly, opting instead to have a reserved conversation to discuss the matter. Lula proposed a bilateral solution between Colombia and Venezuela, suggesting himself as a peacemaker between the two countries.

Later, Lula talked by phone with Venezuelan President &lt;a href="w%3AHugo%20Ch%C3%A1vez"&gt;Hugo Chavez&lt;/a&gt;. The Brazilian Minister of Foreign Relations &lt;a href="w%3ACelso%20Amorim"&gt;Celso Amorim&lt;/a&gt; will coordinate the eventual Brazilian efforts to help solve the crisis.

Yesterday, after a meeting with &lt;a href="w%3APeru"&gt;Peruvian&lt;/a&gt; Minister of Foreign Relations Manuel Rodríguez, the Colombian Minister of Foreign Relations, Carolina Barco, said in a interview with Radio Caracol &lt;a href="http%3A//www.caracol.com.co/realarchi2.asp%3Fid%3D140756"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that Colombian chancellery is engaging in a dialogue in the best terms with the Venezuelan chancellery and that there exists the best spirit to solve the problems.

<h3>Lula's role</h3>
Brazil has a seemingly good relationship with Colombia. In March 2003, Lula met Uribe and they discussed the concerns of both countries. They also discussed the FARC. Brazil did not want to name the FARC as a terrorist group. Amorim explained that it is not part of Brazilian policy to classify political groups as terrorists. Brazil, however voted for a 
&lt;a href="w%3AOrganization%20of%20American%20States"&gt;Organization of American States&lt;/a&gt; motion condemning an alleged terrorist FARC attack in Colombia &lt;a href="http%3A//www.vermelho.org.br/diario/2003/0307/0307_uribe.asp"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.bbc.co.uk/portuguese/noticias/2003/030306_colombiafarc1vrra.shtml"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Chavez and Lula &lt;a href="http%3A//www.vermelho.org.br/diario/2003/0827/0827_lula_venezuela.asp"&gt;have a close relationship&lt;/a&gt;. President Lula repeatedly defended Chavez. Both men have been said to manifest support and empathy for the Cuban President &lt;a href="w%3AFidel%20Castro"&gt;Fidel Castro&lt;/a&gt;, though Lula has distanced himself publicly from the Cuban leader. 

In an &lt;a href="http%3A//www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn%3Fpagename%3Darticle%26amp%3Bnode%3D%26amp%3BcontentId%3DA55409-2002Nov2%26amp%3BnotFound%3Dtrue"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Washington%20Post"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; not long after his election, Lula said, "In relation to Cuba, let's not confuse the passion that my generation has for the Cuban revolution and what it represented then with any approval of the Cuban regime today. I defend religious freedom, cultural freedom, freedom for trade unions and political freedom." However, Lula tried to expel the New York Times journalist Larry Rohter because of writings deemed libelous &lt;a href="http%3A//hrw.org/english/docs/2004/05/12/brazil8575.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/05/12/world/main617064.shtml"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Also Lula tried to create a council formed by sympathizers and members of his party to control the press &lt;a href="http%3A//www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/brasil/ult96u63040.shtml"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http%3A//www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/brasil/ult96u64116.shtml"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. 

The FARC is a member of the &lt;a href="w%3AForo%20de%20S%C3%A3o%20Paulo"&gt;Foro de São Paulo&lt;/a&gt; organization led by Lula.
Lula and others members of his party already have received FARC leaders many times &lt;a href="http%3A//www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/mundo/ult94u62119.shtml"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.al.rs.gov.br/anais/50/Plenario/2001/010314.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.estadao.com.br/agestado/noticias/2002/mar/20/9.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.nodo50.org/americalibre/consejo.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Lula supports the FARC position against the influence of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ALatin%20America"&gt;Latin America&lt;/a&gt;. According to the Folha de São Paulo newspaper, in a interview on the Brazilian television channel ♡❤Record♡❤, Lula said FARC should become like the &lt;a href="w%3AWorkers%27%20Party%20%28Brazil%29"&gt;Workers' Party&lt;/a&gt; and should participate in Colombian elections. He denied the supposed Workers' Party relationship with the FARC and said the term ♡❤axis of evil♡❤ used to describe the relationship between Brazil, Venezuela and Cuba was a bad joke &lt;a href="http%3A//www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/brasil/ult96u40090.shtml"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. 

According to Lula, Brazil wants to establish good relationships with all countries, including the United States. However, he leads the &lt;a href="w%3AForo%20de%20S%C3%A3o%20Paulo"&gt;Foro de São Paulo&lt;/a&gt;, an organization whose members the US government sees as enemies. These members include: &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Liberation%20Army%20%28Colombia%29"&gt;National Liberation Army&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARevolutionary%20Armed%20Forces%20of%20Colombia"&gt;the FARC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFarabundo%20Mart%C3%AD%20National%20Liberation%20Front"&gt;Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGuatemalan%20National%20Revolutionary%20Unity"&gt;Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASandinista%20National%20Liberation%20Front"&gt;Sandinista National Liberation Front&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATupamaros"&gt;Tupamaros&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="w%3ACommunist%20Party%20of%20Cuba"&gt;Communist Party of Cuba&lt;/a&gt;.

Stockholm – 
A Swedish pastor, whose sermon against homosexuality led to a hate-crime conviction, presented his appeal to the court yesterday.
The district court had previously found him guilty of "aiming to disregard homosexuals as a group" and sentenced him to one month's imprisonment.

Åke Green, 63, denies that he intended to agitate against homosexuals. "I've only enlightened people about what the Bible has to say," he said.
The legal defence has focused on freedom of religion. Green's lawyer, Percy Bratt, has argued that fundamental human rights are at stake and that Green must be allowed to interpret the Bible without interference from secular authorities. The prosecutor, Kjell Yngvesson, argues that Green crossed the line when he went from merely quoting the bible to "gathering everything from the Bible that condemns homosexuality" and added his own opinions.

In his sermon, which was also distributed in writing, Green argued that homosexuality wasn't "an inborn desire" but "people in the hands of evil powers." The district court referred to four specific issues in its finding:

1) Green had argued that the global AIDS epidemic wouldn't have occurred without homosexuality.&lt;br&gt;
2) He made a connection between sex with animals and homosexuality. (By citing passages from the Bible where both activities are condemned in sequence and arguing that when people "abandon God", some will indulge in this sin as well.)&lt;br&gt; 
3) He made a conncection between pedophilia and homosexuality.(By arguing that a permissive attitude towards homosexuality would "open the gate to forbidden areas and let Sin take root in consciousness." Thus also leading to other sins like pedophilia or bestiality.)&lt;br&gt;
4) He used the phrase "freely I leave purity and accept impurity" with reference to (among other sins) homosexuality.

"This is a huge surprise, though maybe it shouldn't have been," said Dr. Steve Squyres of &lt;a href="Cornell%20University"&gt;Cornell University&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIthaca"&gt;Ithaca&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;N.Y.&lt;/a&gt;, principal investigator for the science instruments on Opportunity and its twin, Spirit.

Opportunity and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASpirit%20rover"&gt;Spirit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; successfully completed their primary three-month missions on Mars in April 2004. NASA has extended their missions twice because the rovers have remained in good enough condition to continue exploring Mars longer than anticipated. They have found geological evidence of past wet environmental conditions that might have been hospitable to life.

Mars – The Mars Rover ♡❤Opportunity♡❤’s latest discovery has sparked a debate. Recently, NASA’s rover found an &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Airon"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Anickel"&gt;nickel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; object that the &lt;a href="Cornell%20University"&gt;Cornell University&lt;/a&gt; researchers on the project believe to be a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ameteorite"&gt;meteorite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . 

The surface of the meteorite was found to be remarkably free of corrosion. Researchers are as yet unsure whether this means it arrived recently or that it has possibly been sandblasted thoroughly.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; has proposed the formation of the International Early Warning Programme (IEWP), with the suggestion that it would have greatly limited the impact of the 2004 Indian Ocean &lt;a href="w%3Aearthquake"&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Atsunami"&gt;tsunamis&lt;/a&gt;.

The system would analyse data from all over the world and rapidly transmit warnings. It would also feature a population training element, to make sure people know what to do upon hearing warnings or to teach them to recognize danger signs.

“This new programme will help bring safety, security and peace of mind,” stated the Director of the UN International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR), Sálvano Briceno, at the World Conference on Disaster Reduction (WCDR) in Kobe, Japan.

The system, first proposed two years ago, has been given new impetus by the recent disaster in the Indian Ocean. It will warn against many types of natural disaster including wildfires, floods, droughts, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis.

The Program will see many existing UN programs working together, including the World Food Program, the World Meteological Program, the &lt;a href="w%3AUNESCO"&gt;UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization&lt;/a&gt; (UNESCO), and the &lt;a href="w%3AUNEP"&gt;UN Environment Programme&lt;/a&gt; (UNEP). One third of the people the World Food Program helps are the victims of natural disasters.

The system will be built around better, more open flow of regional data and the formulation of local warning plans.

Following its "ground-breaking" success, &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; is now preparing to send two &lt;a href="w%3Ataikonaut"&gt;taikonauts&lt;/a&gt; to space in the autumn of this year. The two Chinese spacemen will be delivered to space through its self-designed VI spaceship, and will orbit the Earth for up to five days.

"The spaceship's re-entry module, orbital capsule and propulsion module are being equipped, and preparation work for the launch is in full swing", said Sun Laiyan, Director of China's National Space Administration.

China's first manned space mission happened in October 2003, in which the &lt;a href="w%3AShenzhou%20V"&gt;Shenzhou V&lt;/a&gt; spaceship circled the Earth fourteen times and landed safely by parachute on the northern plains of China. The success of the misson aroused strong patriotic feeling across the country, portraying &lt;a href="w%3AYang%20Liwei"&gt;Yang Liwei&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; China's first astronaut ever &amp;mdash; as a great national hero. 

Within the next few years, China also plans to land on the Moon.

&lt;a href="w%3AKim%20Beazley"&gt;Kim Beazley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AALP"&gt;Labor&lt;/a&gt; backbencher and former party leader, may have to face challengers in his bid to fill the vacuum left by the &lt;a href="Latham%20quits%20as%20Australian%20Labor%20leader"&gt;resignation of previous labor leader&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Latham"&gt;Mark Latham&lt;/a&gt;. Both Shadow &lt;a href="w%3Aforeign%20affairs"&gt;Foreign Affairs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aminister"&gt;Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Rudd"&gt;Kevin Rudd&lt;/a&gt; and Shadow &lt;a href="w%3AHealth"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; minister &lt;a href="w%3AJulia%20Gillard"&gt;Julia Gillard&lt;/a&gt; have been actively trying to shore up support for bids at the leadership.

Beazley is the only person to have declared his candidacy so far, while both Gillard and Rudd have both refused to commit to running or not running. After returning from his tour of tsunami devastated &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20East%20Asia"&gt;South East Asia&lt;/a&gt; Rudd said that, "Once I've had a shave, what I'd like to do is hit the phones and talk to colleagues".

&lt;a href="w%3AFrontbencher"&gt;Frontbencher&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ALaurie%20Ferguson"&gt;Laurie Ferguson&lt;/a&gt; who is backing Ms Gillard told &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt; radio that, "From what I gather around the place, I think there's a number of people urging her to run. Quite frankly I think Gillard is the most impressive person. I think she'll fire people. It's a new look for the party. It's a woman. It's different. We're not talking about someone who's just a trendy commodity. She's actually intelligent, articulate and strong-minded."

Regarding the leadership challenge opposition treasury spokesman &lt;a href="w%3AWayne%20Swan"&gt;Wayne Swan&lt;/a&gt; said:
"There are a whole host of problems the Labor Party has to confront, not just the leadership. We do have to confront matters of policy, the development of our economic policy, the structure of the party - these are all important issues and they have to be on the table. But to resolve any of these issues we have to have the maximum degree of unity and that is why the leader that is elected should be elected with a very strong mandate."

Anti-gay groups accuse a music video, with over 100 children's TV heroes such as SpongeBob SquarePants, of being a vehicle for pro-gay propaganda.

The video's makers say the music video - a re-recording of the Sister Sledge hit "We Are Family" - is to promote tolerance and diversity to America's children. 

&lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Dobson"&gt;Dr. James C. Dobson&lt;/a&gt;, co-founder of the pro-Family Christian Ministry &lt;a href="w%3AFocus%20on%20the%20Family"&gt;Focus on the Family&lt;/a&gt;, singled out SpongeBob at a black-tie dinner for members of Congress in the run-up to G.W. Bush's inauguration on 2005 Jan 18, according to The New York Times.

Dobson told the guests that the cartoon sponge had been enlisted in a "pro-homosexual video" that was going to be mailed to thousands of elementary schools promoting a "tolerance pledge" that included a reference to "sexual identity."

The video's creator, &lt;a href="w%3ANile%20Rodgers"&gt;Nile Rodgers&lt;/a&gt;, who wrote the disco hit "We Are Family," told The New York Times that Dobson's objection stems from a misunderstanding. Rodgers said he founded the We Are Family Foundation after the 9/11 attacks to create a music video to teach children about multiculturalism. The video has appeared on television networks, and nothing in it or its accompanying materials refers to sexual identity. The pledge, borrowed from the &lt;a href="w%3ASouthern%20Poverty%20Law%20Center"&gt;Southern Poverty Law Center&lt;/a&gt;, is not mentioned on the video and is available only on the group's Web site.

Rodgers suggested that Dobson and the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Family%20Association"&gt;American Family Association&lt;/a&gt; might have been confused because of an unrelated Web site belonging to another group called "We Are Family," which supports gay youth.

&lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARomania"&gt;Romania's&lt;/a&gt; electricity production and distribution company, plans to introduce a new system which will allow its consumers to pay their power bills via the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AShort%20Message%20Service"&gt;Short Message Service&lt;/a&gt;, or SMS. Currently, electricity bills can be paid directly at banks using cash or credit cards, or via &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AAutomatic%20Teller%20Machine"&gt;automatic teller machines&lt;/a&gt; (ATMs). Additionally, since 2004, customers have been able to pay their bills at Agip gas stations.

In Romania, which reached more than 10 million mobile phone subscribers at the end of 2004, SMS remains a very popular and affordable method of quick communication. Recently, there has been a push to launch SMS/mobile telephony as a method of payment or business, hence establishing an &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Am-commerce"&gt;m-commerce&lt;/a&gt; network. The move by Electrica for bill-payment via SMS is one of the first such initiatives.

The &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARomania"&gt;Romanian&lt;/a&gt; band ♡❤&lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASarmalele%20Reci"&gt;Sarmalele Reci&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ have decided to join the bandwagon of aid toward the victims of the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3A2004%20Indian%20Ocean%20earthquake"&gt;Indian Ocean tsunami&lt;/a&gt; by holding a concert in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABucharest"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday, January 23. The concert will be held at the Palace Hall. The band will donate all of the proceeds from the concert to the tsunami relief effort. 

Soloist Zoli Andras said that, "This is a good exercise for the Western man who lives in a society with a much higher living standard than in many regions of Asia." The aim of the band in this concert is "to take [people] out of their daily selfishness and make them think a little about their fellows in Asia who were struck by fate."

In the month of January, Romanians have organised a wide series of events, many of them featuring celebrities, to raise funds for the victims of the tsunami. A &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Atelethon"&gt;telethon&lt;/a&gt; was organised last Sunday, January 16, and, on the same Sunday as the ♡❤Sarmalele Reci♡❤ concert, Romanian artists will auction off their works to raise money for the disaster victims. 

The concert is part of a campaign by &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ATeleviziunea%20Romana"&gt;Televiziunea Română&lt;/a&gt;, the Romanian national broadcaster, to involve the Romanian public in the fundraising effort.

After 34 years as president of &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Jones%20University"&gt;Bob Jones University&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Jones%20III"&gt;Bob Jones III&lt;/a&gt; announced yesterday that he will retire on May 7. He will be replaced by his son, Stephen Jones. 

Jones, 65, will continue as Chairman of the Board and Chancellor. The Christian university was established by his grandfather, the evangelist Bob Jones Sr., in 1927. It has been the subject of much controversy because of its racial policies and anti-Catholicism.

When &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; made a speech at the non-accredited college during his 2000 presidential campaign, many critics questioned his judgment, asking why he would support a college with an official ban on interracial dating. The ban was subsequently dropped.

Jones is an ardent supporter of Bush. In his letter congratulating the president on his reelection, Jones wrote, "Pull out all the stops and make a difference. If you have weaklings around you who do not share your biblical values, shed yourself of them."

The Romanian President, &lt;a href="w%3ATraian%20Basescu"&gt;Traian Băsescu&lt;/a&gt; yesterday said that Romania is perceived as a "mafia country" and asked prosecutors to take immediate steps to eliminate the high-level corruption in the country.

Basescu told the prosecutors at the ♡❤High Court of Cassation and Justice♡❤ that they should resign if they can't do what it takes to ensure that Romania does not become a mafia-like country. Less urgent problems like prostitution will have to wait, he said. 

Cases of high-level corruption, such as the Camaru brothers' bribing of police and politicians must be given top priority, the president claims.

Romania's new president, elected in December 2004, has pledged to cut down on corruption. He has appointed a new centrist government of young intellectuals, including a justice minister, Monica Macovei, who is not a member of any political party. In order for Romania to join the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; in 2007, it has been told that it must work comprehensively to lower corruption, which is currently a major problem on the road to accession.

Seeking to "bring together a select group of thoughtful bloggers and journalists", at &lt;a href="w%3AHarvard"&gt;Harvard&lt;/a&gt; today opened a two-day, by-invitation only, ♡❤♡Blogging, Journalism and Credibility: Battleground and Common Ground♡❤♡ conference.

Held at the Kennedy School of Government, the conference was an initiative of the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Library%20Association"&gt;American Library Association's&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABerkman%20Center%20for%20Internet%20and%20Society"&gt;Berkman Center for Internet and Society&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.ksg.harvard.edu/presspol/"&gt;Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy&lt;/a&gt;.

"One of the problems [with &lt;a href="w%3ABlog"&gt;blogs&lt;/a&gt;]," said &lt;a href="w%3ADan%20Gillmor"&gt;Dan Gillmor&lt;/a&gt; of Grassroots Media Inc., "is that any random website can look as good as any other website. We're going to be working this through for a long time. We're going to have to tell people, ♡❤be skeptical♡❤."

Addressing the question of credibility, both in mainstream media and in the new media self-publishing "blogosphere", is one of the goals of the conference. The rapid transformation of the blogging media, its acceptance and repudiation as a form of journalism, is also a topic slated for discussion.

Corporate media has flirted with, disputed, and been directly affected by, bloggers. Future possible interactions between the new, blogging media, and mainstream media, provide topics for discussion.

Attendees and speakers included both established and new media names, academics and professionals, and amateurs. Topics covered ranged from jargon and terminology, through business models, and on to more esoteric subjects like "podcasting" and "vlogging".

♡❤♡UPDATE:♡❤♡ The conference wound up with a session covering issues identified during the conference and an open session of free-ranging discussion.

Images from the Huygens probe show that liquid methane flows through and into Titan's rivers, channels, lakes, springs, and other as-yet-undiscovered bodies of liquid. &lt;a href="w%3ATitan"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href="w%3ASaturn"&gt;Saturn's&lt;/a&gt; largest moon, and the moon the &lt;a href="Huygens%20probe%20lands%20on%20Saturn%27s%20moon%20Titan%2C%20returns%20pictures"&gt;Cassini-Huygens probe&lt;/a&gt; is inspecting. 

The image (right) sent back from Titan via Huygens shows the terrain carved by the liquid methane. Deltas and rivers may be flowing with the substance. 

The methane rain causes erosion to the planet's land surface, carving out features like rivers in which the liquid methane and possibly other fluids flow.

Unrest concerning the &lt;a href="w%3ABelize"&gt;Belizian&lt;/a&gt; government's new taxes, which began on Jan. 20, 2005, continued as people burned government offices and union workers went on strike, closing ports and shutting down water services.

The unrest has been a reaction to the new budget for 2005-6, passed on January 13th, that introduced big tax raises. The largest individual rise was a new 100% sales tax on Rum. The unusual introduction of the new budget two months before the end of the financial year has been justified by the government as being required to increase funding for Education services. Opposition campaigners have claimed that the government is trying to unfairly collect two months of additional taxes.

During the afternoon, protesters campaigned outside the Belizian National Assembly, with rocks being thrown at riot police. Later, following the expiration of the protest permit, protesters and police exchanged cherry bombs and tear gas. The Belize Defense Force was called in to disperse the crowd, after which sporadic gunfire was heard until the crowd later dispersed.

This is only the third time that this kind of unrest has hit Belize. The first time was in the 50s, and the second time was during the 80s when there was a proposal drafted to give part of the country to &lt;a href="w%3AGuatemala"&gt;Guatemala&lt;/a&gt;.

BELMOPAN, Belize – The strike widens: postal workers, customs officers, immigration officers, even doctors (they will treat emergency cases) have joined the strike as the pressure mounts on the government to repeal
recent tax hikes and to reform their ways.

The following stories made international headlines Friday:

<h3>Polish WW2 Hero, 'Courier from Warsaw' Dies at 91</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3AJan%20Nowak-Jezioranski"&gt;Jan Nowak-Jeziorański&lt;/a&gt;, a Polish writer, journalist, an envoy between the commanders of the &lt;a href="w%3AHome%20Army"&gt;Home Army&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3APolish%20Government%20in%20Exile"&gt;Polish Government in Exile&lt;/a&gt;, the head of the Polish section of the &lt;a href="w%3ARadio%20Free%20Europe"&gt;Radio Free Europe&lt;/a&gt; and an advisor to the USA presidents dies in Warsaw, Poland.

<h3>Deadly Attack on Baghdad Mosque</h3>

At least 14 people have died in a car bombing at a Shia religious building in Iraq's capital, amid threats of a long war from a key militant. 

<h3>Palestinian Forces Deployed In Gaza</h3>

In Gaza, Palestinian forces have taken up a position in the north. This action was enacted on hopes that it would degrade the control militants have of that area to encourage peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians on their conflicts. 

<h3>Putin Sends His Congratulations to Yushchenko</h3>
Russian President Vladimir Putin today has sent seemingly warm congratulations to Viktor Yushchenko, the candidate who won the controversial and extended Ukrainian election. Recently, the Ukrainian High Court rejected the plea of Yushchenko's rival, Viktor Yanukovych for recounts and "fair elections."

<h1>NASA's Swift detects possible birth of black hole</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=NASA%27s%20Swift%20detects%20possible%20birth%20of%20black%20hole&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

On Jan. 17, the &lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;-led Swift satellite mission detected and imaged its first &lt;a href="w%3Agamma-ray"&gt;gamma-ray&lt;/a&gt; burst, one of the most powerful explosions to occur in the universe.

The burst was in the midst of exploding as Swift, designed to autonomously repoint 
itself, turned and focused in less than 200 seconds on the event. The satellite was 
fast enough to capture an image with its &lt;a href="w%3AX-Ray%20Telescope"&gt;X-Ray Telescope&lt;/a&gt; (XRT), while gamma rays were 
still being detected with the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT).

"This is the first time an X-ray telescope has imaged a gamma-ray burst while it 
was bursting," said Dr. Neil Gehrels, Swift's principal investigator at NASA's 
&lt;a href="w%3AGoddard%20Space%20Flight%20Center"&gt;Goddard Space Flight Center&lt;/a&gt;, Greenbelt, MD. "Most bursts are gone in about ten 
seconds, and few last upwards of a minute. Previous X-ray images have captured 
the burst afterglow, not the burst itself."

"This is the one that didn't get away," said Prof. John Nousek, Swift's mission 
operations director at &lt;a href="w%3APenn%20State%20University"&gt;Penn State University&lt;/a&gt;, in State College, PA. "And this is 
what Swift was built to do: to detect these fleeting gamma-ray bursts and focus 
its telescopes on them autonomously within about a minute. The most exciting 
thing is this mission is just revving up."

Swift has three main instruments. The BAT detects bursts and initiates the 
autonomous slewing to bring the XRT and the Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) 
within focus of the burst. In December, the BAT started detecting bursts, 
including a remarkable triple detection on Dec. 19. Today's announcement 
marks the first BAT detection autonomously followed by XRT detection, 
demonstrating the satellite is swiftly slewing as planned. The UVOT is still 
being tested, and it was not collecting data when the burst was detected. Scientists 
expect Swift to be fully operational by Feb. 1. 

"We are frantically analyzing the XRT data to understand the X-ray emission seen 
during the initial explosion and the very early afterglow," said Dr. David 
Burrows, the XRT lead at Penn State. "This is a whole new ballgame. No one has 
ever imaged X-rays during the transition of a gamma-ray burst from the brilliant 
flash to the fading embers."

The origin of gamma-ray bursts remains a mystery. At least some appear to 
originate in massive star explosions. Others might be the result of merging black 
holes or neutron stars. Any of these scenarios likely will result in the 
formation of a new black hole.

The Swift satellite's two-year mission will be to: 
<ul>
BULLET::::- Determine the origin of gamma-ray bursts.
BULLET::::- Classify gamma-ray bursts and search for new types.
BULLET::::- Determine how the explosion develops.
BULLET::::- Use gamma-ray bursts to study the early universe.
BULLET::::- Perform the first sensitive hard X-ray survey of the sky.
</ul>
Swift, still in its checkout phase, is an international collaboration launched on 
Nov. 20, 2004. It is a NASA mission in partnership with the &lt;a href="w%3AItalian%20Space%20Agency"&gt;Italian Space Agency&lt;/a&gt; and the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council, United Kingdom.

&lt;a href="w%3AJan%20Nowak-Jezioranski"&gt;Jan Nowak-Jeziorański&lt;/a&gt;, a Polish writer, journalist, legendary resistance fighter and an envoy between the commanders of the &lt;a href="w%3AHome%20Army"&gt;Home Army&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3APolish%20Government%20in%20Exile"&gt;Polish government in exile&lt;/a&gt;, nicknamed ♡❤Courier from Warsaw♡❤, the head of the Polish section of &lt;a href="w%3ARadio%20Free%20Europe"&gt;Radio Free Europe&lt;/a&gt; for a quarter of a century and an advisor to the US presidents Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter died Thursday evening, January 20 in a hospital in his native Warsaw, Poland.

Jan Nowak-Jeziorański fought in the Polish Army during the &lt;a href="w%3APolish%20September%20Campaign"&gt;Polish September Campaign&lt;/a&gt; in 1939 as an artillery NCO. He was taken prisoner of war by the Germans in Volhynia but managed to escape and returned to Warsaw. He quickly joined the Polish resistance and in 1940 became the main organiser of the Akcja N, a secret organisation preparing German-language newspapers and other propaganda material pretending to be official German publications, in order to wage psychological warfare against German troops.

He also served as an envoy between the commanders of the Home Army and the Polish government in exile and other allied governments. During one of such missions in July 1944, he arrived in Warsaw only a few days before the &lt;a href="w%3AWarsaw%20Uprising"&gt;Warsaw Uprising&lt;/a&gt; broke out. During the Uprising he took an active part in the fights against the Germans and also organised the Polish radio that maintained contact with the Allied countries through daily broadcasts in Polish and English. Shortly before the capitulation of the Polish capital, he was ordered by the Polish commander-in-chief Tadeusz Bór-Komorowski to leave the city and find his way to London. He managed to evade being captured and reached Great Britain, bringing with him large quantities of documents and photos. For his bravery and his travels through the German-occupied Europe he was awarded with the &lt;a href="w%3AVirtuti%20Militari"&gt;Virtuti Militari&lt;/a&gt;, the highest Polish military medal. He also gained a nick-name ♡❤Courier from Warsaw♡❤ (♡❤Kurier z Warszawy♡❤), which he later used as a title of his memoirs.

After the war, Jan Nowak-Jeziorański stayed in the West, initially in London and then in Munich and Washington. Between 1948 and 1976 he was one of the most notable personalities of the Polish division of the BBC radio agency. In 1952 he also became the head of the Polish section of the Munich-based Radio Free Europe. Through his daily radio broadcasts he remained one of the most popular radio personalities, both in communist-held Poland and among the Polish diaspora in the West. After giving up his posts in 1976, he became one of the most prominent members of the Polish American Congress and headed the organisation between 1979 and 1996. He also worked as an advisor to the American National Security Agency. Through his contacts with many notable politicians in the USA, he was one of the proponents of Poland's membership in NATO (achieved in 1999).

In the 1990s, he started his cooperation with the Polish Radio and wrote a series of broadcasts titled "Polska z oddali" (Poland from Distance). Since 1990 he was also present in the Polish Television as an author of monthly programmes. In July 2002 he returned to Warsaw for good. He was an active supporter of Poland's entry into the European Union. Most of his books, published abroad as well as those published in Poland after 1989, were best-sellers and gained him even more popularity.

For his writings, he was awarded with some of the most prestigious Polish literary awards, including the Kisiel Award (1999), Ksawery Pruszyński Memorial Prize of the Polish Pen-Club (2001) and the Superwiktor award for tv personalities. In 2003 he was also awarded with the Człowiek Pojednania prize by the Polish Council of Christians and Jews for his part in the Polish-Jewish dialogue. Finally, he was made the doctor honoris causa of many Polish universities, including the Warsaw University, Jagiellonian University and his alma mater, the University in Poznań.

He died in Warsaw at the age of 91 on the evening of Thursday, 20 January 2005. He subscribed all of his archives to the Ossolineum Institute. In the reports of his death all major Polish daily newspapers referred to him as the ♡❤Polish hero♡❤ and ♡❤one of the last moral authorities♡❤.

IRAQ – According to the New York Times, in an ambush occurring Jan. 19 in northern &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, outside of &lt;a href="w%3ABaiji%2C%20Iraq"&gt;Baiji&lt;/a&gt;, a British man and an Iraqi security guard were killed and a Brazilian contractor was kidnapped. Both of the men who died in the attack were working for Janusian Security Risk Management of &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;. The Brazilian man, an engineer, was working for Norberto Odebrecht, &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20America"&gt;South America&lt;/a&gt;'s largest construction company. His identity was not revealed by the company.

The &lt;a href="w%3AJaish%20Ansar%20al-Sunna"&gt;Army of Ansar al Sunna&lt;/a&gt; has taken credit for the ambush, posting this statement online:
"The lions of the faith of Prophet Mohammad (pbuh) were able to ambush and kidnap two agents - a Briton and a Swede - working for the intelligence agency of the infidel forces in Beiji and God's law was enforced by killing them."

The Army of Ansar al Sunna plans to release further details about the attack.

The Norberto Odebrecht S.A. removed its employees from Iraq.

On Friday, the newly elected Palestinian leader &lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud%20Abbas"&gt;Mahmoud Abbas&lt;/a&gt; ordered thousands of armed Palestinian security officials into positions in the northern &lt;a href="w%3AGaza%20strip"&gt;Gaza strip&lt;/a&gt; to prevent terrorist strikes on &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;.

It is part of a plan that will include bolstering the security presence along the Gaza-Israel border, over the next few weeks. The plan ultimately will post three thousand troops in northern Gaza. It is the first time Palestinian forces have been used to protect the border from terrorist attacks since the resurgence of the &lt;a href="w%3AIntifada"&gt;Intifada&lt;/a&gt; in 2000.

Israel immediately responded to the move, with Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AAriel%20Sharon"&gt;Ariel Sharon&lt;/a&gt; restoring dialogue with Abbas and continuing Israeli-Palestinian co-operation on intelligence and security.

Leaders of the militant groups &lt;a href="w%3AHamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APalestinian%20Islamic%20Jihad"&gt;Islamic Jihad&lt;/a&gt; are also in talks with Abbas, although are publicly denying any agreement.

&lt;a href="%3Aw%3ATeliaSonera"&gt;TeliaSonera&lt;/a&gt; Sweden has announced today that it is increasing the speed of data traffic through its &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AGSM"&gt;GSM&lt;/a&gt; mobile network due to the introduction of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEDGE"&gt;EDGE&lt;/a&gt; technology. This will require an investment of approximately €110 million, over a four-year period. The new technology will enable transmission speeds of up to 210/105 kpbs.

The company also intends to increase the coverage of its GSM network from 70% to 90% of Sweden's land area. While &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; has a high mobile penetration rate and a high rate of coverage in terms of population, land area coverage was previously only 70% due to the country's relatively low population density as well as its northern highland areas.

&lt;a href="%3Aw%3ATeliaSonera"&gt;TeliaSonera&lt;/a&gt; is the largest communications company in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ANorthern%20Europe"&gt;Northern Europe&lt;/a&gt;, formed as a result of a merger between Sweden's Telia and Finland's Sonera. It is owned 45.3% by the Swedish state.

The Spanish government, in collaboration with the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.sgae.es/"&gt;Spanish General Society of Authors and Editors&lt;/a&gt; (SGAE), has developed a new Internet law that will hold &lt;a href="w%3AISP"&gt;Internet Service Providers&lt;/a&gt; responsible for the web content provided through their services. This law is intended to prevent the piracy of copyrighted material, but it may force ISPs to censor web content in order to deflect possible legal issues.

The Spanish Internet User Association has claimed that such law will break the &lt;a href="w%3ASpanish%20Constitution%20of%201978"&gt;Spanish Constitution&lt;/a&gt; and several European directives that discharge an ISP's responsibility.

Since the terror threat tipping mayhem in Massachusetts, the governer and other officials have seemed to take it half seriously, and half not. Now the case is still being explored. A few days after the threats, terror suspects were identified in photos last night. The United States Attorney Michael Sullivan spoke during a news conference at the Massachusetts Statehouse in Boston on the 20th concerning these terror suspects.

&lt;a href="w%3A%20JP%20Morgan%20Chase"&gt;JP Morgan Chase&lt;/a&gt; issued an apology on Thursday for the actions of two of its predecessor banks that accepted slaves as collateral on loans. 

Citizens Bank and Canal Bank in Louisiana, which were ultimately acquired by JP Morgan, accepted approximately 13,000 slaves as collateral and took ownership of approximately 1250 between 1831 and 1865, according to a memo to employees from CEO and Chairman William Harrison and President James Dimon.

The memo was in response to a Chicago ordinance, which requires disclosure of slave ownership.

"We apologize to the American public, and particularly to African-Americans, for the role that Citizens Bank and Canal Bank played during that period," said the company on its website. "Although we cannot change the past, we are committed to learning from and emerging stronger because of it." &lt;a href="http%3A//www.bankone.com/ourapology"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

JP Morgan was involved in a class action suit in 2002 which sought reparations for slavery from it and 17 other companies. The case was dismissed last year.

The bank will establish a $5 million, need-based scholarship for African-American students in Louisiana.

JP Morgan stock fell 1.6 percent on Thursday to $37.25.

South America – 
&lt;a href="w%3AColombia"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AVenezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt; continue to clash over the circumstances of the announced arrest of Rodrigo Granda, alleged leader of the &lt;a href="w%3AFARC"&gt;FARC&lt;/a&gt;.
Colombia released a list of terrorists harbored by Venezuela and a recording of a conversation between alleged members of the FARC. Venezuela said it will request the extradition of terrorists in Colombia. In &lt;a href="w%3ACaracas"&gt;Caracas&lt;/a&gt; a march was scheduled by thousands of activists supporting the President of Venezuela &lt;a href="w%3AHugo%20Chavez"&gt;Hugo Chavez&lt;/a&gt; and protesting against the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt;. President Chavez appeared on television to accuse the USA of being behind the Colombian accusations. The head of the Colombian Police was traveling in a helicopter when it came under attack by forces of the FARC.

Colombia is supported by the USA in opposing the FARC who are believed to be involved in international drug trade. Venezuela is allegedly supported by the &lt;a href="w%3AForo%20de%20S%C3%A3o%20Paulo"&gt;Foro de São Paulo&lt;/a&gt; as member states, along with &lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AFARC"&gt;FARC&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Colombia released proofs of the FARC activities in Venezuela</h2>
According to the Colombian Radio Caracol, La Fiscalía General de la Nación (Attorney General) of &lt;a href="w%3AColombia"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt; revealed proofs of &lt;a href="w%3AFARC"&gt;FARC&lt;/a&gt; activities in &lt;a href="w%3AVenezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt; (January 21). The evidence includes the recording of a telephone conversation between two presumed guerrillas, and a list with the names of seven members from FARC and one individual from &lt;a href="w%3AEj%C3%A9rcito%20de%20Liberaci%C3%B3n%20Nacional"&gt;Ejército de Liberación Nacional&lt;/a&gt; (the National Liberation Army, or ♡❤♡ELN♡❤♡) who Colombia claims are continuously in Venezuelan territory. (&lt;a href="http%3A//www.caracol.com.co/realarchi2.asp%3Fid%3D141042"&gt;♡❤♡audio♡❤♡&lt;/a&gt;)

The names of the alleged terrorists, and the crimes Colombia accuses them of, are:

This list was sent to the government of Venezuela.

The Colombian Caracol Radio also obtained the recording of the telephone call in which, according to the Colombian authorities, alias Juan Santrich, presumed member of the General Staff of the FARC, talks with alias Jorge Tivieras. Both men speak in key on the preparation of a political forum that was carried out in the Venezuelan capital in the first days of December. About a hundred guerrillas were at this event, according to the interpretation of the Colombian authorities. This information would be sent to Ivan Marquez, of the secretaryship of the FARC. In the same conversation it is spoken of the attendance of an indigenous delegation. During the event apparently propaganda would have been distributed and a declaration against president of Colombia &lt;a href="w%3A%C3%81lvaro%20Uribe"&gt;Álvaro Uribe&lt;/a&gt; was prepared, although the interlocutors do not mention him by name.

The recording can be heard &lt;a href="http%3A//www.caracol.com.co/realarchi2.asp%3Fid%3D141133"&gt;♡❤♡here♡❤♡&lt;/a&gt;.

The Colombian newspaper ♡❤El Pais♡❤ reported in a &lt;a href="http%3A//elpais-cali.terra.com.co/paisonline/notas/Enero232005/farc.html"&gt;January 23 news release&lt;/a&gt; the helicopters in which the head of the Colombian Police general Jorge Castro and other government officials traveled were attacked by ground forces loyal to the FARC when it flew over a zone of illegal farms in the center-west of the country. No injuries or damage were reported.

<h2>Venezuela responds to Colombia</h2>
After officially receiving from Colombia the list of guerrillas from the FARC and the ELN the Government of Venezuela announced by the Venezuelan minister of the Interior, Jesse Chacón that will request to Colombia the capture and extradition of several ex-military and political leaders in Colombia. They are accused of terrorism by Venezuela. Also Chacón announced that his government will study the documentation presented by Colombia. 

The Venezuelan Minister advanced some names in the list he will send: Felipe Rodríguez (retired general of the National Guard) alias "El Cuervo" accused of the attack against the consulate of Colombia in Caracas and the industralist Pedro Carmona, who self-proclaimed president of Venezuela after the coup of April of 2002 in Venezuela.
The Venezuelan Vice-President José Vicente Rangel said the list of terrorists sent by Colombia to Venezuela was frustrating. According to him the list should be completed with the names of Colombian drug-dealers and paramilitary forces who usually enters Venezuelan territory.

The president of the Venezuelan National Assembly Mature Nicholas denounced a multimillionaire campaign against Hugo Chávez. He explained the campaign would be being supported by a sector of the Government of the United States from the halting of the guerrilla Rodrigo Granda: "This campaign has a planning component and execution on the part of the CIA".

"They are going to use it in an international show to indicate it like a species of witness who will contribute testimony in against of Venezuela, our democracy to justify and to give veracity to the denunciations that the government (of Alvaro) Uribe has removed from last hour".

Mature added that they had information on a new scandal that will be promoted as of the next week from the testimonies that a person of name "Sonia" (protected by USA laws and tied to drug trafficking crimes) will give.

A march of thousands of supporters to President &lt;a href="w%3AHugo%20Ch%C3%A1vez"&gt;Hugo Chávez&lt;/a&gt; was schedulled to January 23 in &lt;a href="w%3ACaracas"&gt;Caracas&lt;/a&gt;, Venezuela. The activivists demand respect to the sovereignty of Venezuela, support the Venezuelan governor in the crisis with Colombia and protest against the USA.

According to Venezuelan newspaper El Universal in national chain of radio and television Chávez said that the case of the kidnapping of Rodrigo Granda "is a new attack of North American imperialism". 
He accused the "imperialistic government of the USA " "in a hurry run to defend this upsetting and this vulgarity, in addition to the government of Colombia". He described the Secretary of State of the USA, Condoleezza Rice, as "illiterate" to not know what it is happening in Venezuela. He said that the United States is "the force more negative than can have for this world". &lt;a href="http%3A//www.eluniversal.com/2005/01/23/pol_ava_23A525919.shtml"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The Chinese Embassy has confirmed a report by the &lt;a href="w%3AAl-Arabiya"&gt;Al-Arabiya&lt;/a&gt; television station that the eight hostages held hostages in Iraq four days ago had been released unharmed.

&lt;a href="w%3AAl-Numan%20Battalion"&gt;Al-Numan Battalion&lt;/a&gt;, the militant group holding the men had threatened to kill them if China failed to clarify its position on Iraq. It reportedly said in a videotape that the hostages were being freed after China said it had advised its citizens not to travel to Iraq.

"The Islamic Resistance Movement, al-Numan Battalion, has decided to release the eight citizens as a goodwill gesture for the friendship between the two countries of Iraq and China," the militant said on the tape. "They were not harmed during the period they were held and also they weren't exchanged for any amount of money," the rebel added.

♡❤♡&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANunatsiavut"&gt;Nunatsiavut&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡ means "Our Beautiful Land" in the Inuktitut language of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInuit"&gt;Inuit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; people of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALabrador"&gt;Labrador&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and the name of their new land as part of a land claims agreement signed on Saturday by the Labrador Inuit Association and representatives of both the &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; federal and Labrador provincial governments.
The land agreement, thirty years in the negotiating, covers 72,520 square kilometers of northern Labrador, as well as special rights over 48,690 sqare kilometers of coastal waters. The Inuit will become owners of 15,800 sqare kilometers of the land, and will co-manage the balance. Under the agreement the Government of Canada will transfer $140 million to the Labrador Inuit, as well as $156 million for implementation.

The agreement also came with an apology for a forced relocation program half a century ago. The apology was delivered by the premier of Newfoundland and Labrador &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADanny%20Williams%20%28politician%29"&gt;Danny Williams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The land claims agreement must still be approved by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20House%20of%20Commons"&gt;Canadian House of Commons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , but has already passed through the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20of%20Assembly"&gt;House of Assembly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of Newfoundland and Labrador.

An estimated 15,000 people attended a memorial service in Hong Kong for &lt;a href="w%3AZhao%20Ziyang"&gt;Zhao Ziyang&lt;/a&gt;, the former Chinese leader.

Zhao, who died at 85, was a reformer who was removed from office, and imprisoned, in 1989 after denouncing the use of force against student &lt;a href="w%3ATiananmen%20Square%20protests%20of%201989"&gt;protesters in Tiananmen Square&lt;/a&gt;.

Though acknowledged for his economic reforms in the 1980s, controversy surrounds Zhao's funeral. Zhao was removed from his position as secretary general of the &lt;a href="w%3ACommunist%20Party%20of%20China"&gt;Communist Party of China&lt;/a&gt; and placed under house arrest in 1989 after denouncing the use of force against student protesters in &lt;a href="w%3ATiananmen%20Square"&gt;Tiananmen Square&lt;/a&gt;. Analysts suggest the CPC, fearful that Zhao's death would rekindle unrest, reluctantly allowed Zhao to be memorialized in public after party elders criticized Beijing for not honoring Zhao's contributions.

Szeto Wah, chairman of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Democratic Patriotic Movements in China, gave the eulogy at a makeshift funeral altar in Victoria Park, Hong Kong. Szeto said the turnout was a testimony to the public's respect for Zhao.

Zhao died Monday, January 17 at the age of 85. Zhao had been recovering from pneumonia in a Beijing hospital before suffering a series of strokes and lapsing into a coma January 15.

Palestinian militants denied claims by an Israeli minister that they had agreed a ceasefire. Just a short while after a ceasefire was apparently agreed between Israel and the new Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, a spokesman for Palestinian militant group Hamas denied the claim.

&lt;a href="w%3ARomania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;'s only nuclear plant, at &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ACernavoda"&gt;Cernavodă&lt;/a&gt; announced yesterday that the amount of electrical energy produced at the plant in 2004 was the highest ever, at a record 5,142,300 megawatt-hours (MWh). This exceeded the previous 2002 record by 36,000 MWh.

Cernavodă Unit 1, brought into operation in 1992, supplies around 10-12% of Romania's energy consumption. According to Nuclearelectrica, the operator of the plant, Cernavodă's performance has been better than the average of the world's 417 reactors. Nuclearelectrica considers the security of the plant, as well as of its employees and the environment, to be of utmost importance.

Currently, two more nuclear units are in construction at the Cernavodă plant. Unit 2 is 80% complete and will commence operation in 2006, while Unit 3 is approximately 40% complete. In the future, the nuclear plant is expected to produce a significant amount of the electrical energy of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASoutheastern%20Europe"&gt;southeastern Europe&lt;/a&gt;.

Cernavodă is Europe's only &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ACANDU"&gt;CANDU&lt;/a&gt; reactor. CANDU reactors, which are designed in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, are one of the most advantageous forms of nuclear reactors due to their fuel efficiency and low amount of down-time.

The new &lt;a href="Ukraine"&gt;Ukranian&lt;/a&gt; president &lt;a href="Viktor%20Yushchenko"&gt;Viktor Yushchenko&lt;/a&gt; was today sworn into office in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKiev"&gt;Kiev&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's Independence Square, drawing a line under a bitter dispute between him and opposition candidate &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AViktor%20Yanukovych"&gt;Viktor Yanukovych&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Taking the oath of office, Yushchenko added "This is a victory of freedom over tyranny. The victory of law over lawlessness."

Opposition candidate and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; backed Viktor Yanukovych has challenged the validity of the election rerun on December 26 2004, which saw his victory overruled. As recently as a few days ago, the Supreme Court overruled a final request to delay the ceremony. Mr Yanukovych has stated that he will take his battle to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Court%20of%20Human%20Rights"&gt;European Court of Human Rights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

In a ceremony watched by eight heads of state, Viktor Yushchenko urged unity between sides and promised deeper integration into the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Pirelli Relativity Challenge 2005—Explain relativity with a five minute multi-media presentation, win $30,000.

Although best known for the theory of special relativity, it was a series of papers published in 1905 (later known as the "Annus Mirabilis" papers–the miracle year) that formed a break from Newtonion or classical science and changed modern physics.

While the title isn't known on a world-wide basis, the final paper Einstein that year–♡❤Does the Inertia of a Body Depend on Its Energy Content?♡❤–produced a famous mathmetical formula: ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AE%3Dmc%C2%B2"&gt;E=mc²&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, which describes the relationship between &lt;a href="w%3Amass"&gt;mass&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aenergy"&gt;energy&lt;/a&gt;.

Bucharest, Romania – The &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARomania"&gt;Romanian&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ACalin%20Popescu%20Tariceanu"&gt;Călin Popescu Tăriceanu&lt;/a&gt; is on an official visit today and tomorrow to &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABrussels"&gt;Brussels&lt;/a&gt;, where he will meet with the president of the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEuropean%20Commission"&gt;European Commission&lt;/a&gt;.

During the visit, Tăriceanu will present the priorities and strategies of the Romanian Government regarding the country's accession to the EU. Romania is expected to join the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; on January 1, 2007, provided it fulfills the commitments to integration that it promised during accession negotiations.

The Prime Minister said that, "The European integration is the government's absolute priority". Tăriceanu was accompanied by the independent justice minister Monica Macovei, who will discuss the Justice and Internal Affairs chapter. Justice and Internal Affairs has remained to date Romania's most problematic chapter towards accession, with the country coming under fire for its political interference in judicial institutions. Macovei claims that by March this year, a reform strategy will be put into place regarding the independence and efficiency of the justice system.

Bucharest, Romania – Mioara Mantale was appointed yesterday as the new prefect of the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARomania"&gt;Romania's&lt;/a&gt; capital &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABucharest"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt;. She is the first female prefect in the history of the city. Mantale said that, "I am honored that the Romanian government had confidence in me to appoint me in this position", adding that a woman in a public position is a positive thing.

Mantale, who is 38 years of age and from the northern town of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AIasi"&gt;Iaşi&lt;/a&gt;, specialises in the capital market and has a masters degree in internal law and international environmental law. 

Prefects in Romania are appointed by the President and are sent to each of the 40 &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ACounties%20of%20Romania"&gt;counties&lt;/a&gt; and well as the capital, Bucharest. They act as the liaison between the central government of Romania and the local governments of each county. 

Mantale's appointment was well received after the previous appointed prefect resigned after President &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ATraian%20Basescu"&gt;Traian Băsescu&lt;/a&gt; claimed that he was not a good choice. Mantale is part of the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28Romania%29"&gt;Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt;, the same party that Băsescu belonged to before being elected as president. She also had good relations with the President while he was the general mayor of Bucharest.

Bucharest, Romania – &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARomania"&gt;Romania's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASocial%20Democrat%20Party%20of%20Romania"&gt;Social Democrat Party&lt;/a&gt; has criticised the government's new fiscal policy, which is centered around the introduction of a 16% flat tax for personal income and company profit.

The Social Democrats, which were in government between 2000 and 2004, were defeated in Romania's elections at the end of 2004. The current centre-right governing coalition is made up of the Liberal and Democrat parties, as well as the Humanist Party and the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania.

The Vice-President of the Social Democrat Party, Mihai Tănăsescu, expressed his concerns that the flat tax would reduce individuals' contribution to the state budget by 10%. He also envisioned a rise in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Ainflation"&gt;inflation&lt;/a&gt; as a result of a greater budget deficit.

The current government, however, defended the flat tax, saying that the drop in budget revenues will be lower than expected, due to taxes being collected more efficiently. The current Minister of Finance, Ionuţ Popescu, said that, "effects of individual tax cuts, along with reducing taxes on companies' profits have helped countries such as Slovakia, Russia and Ireland develop."

During Romania's election campaign in 2004, President &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ATraian%20Basescu"&gt;Traian Băsescu&lt;/a&gt; promised that he would introduce a flat tax of 16%. Romania's previous progressive income tax, during the Social Democrat government, ranged between 18% and 40%. Based on the models of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASlovakia"&gt;Slovakia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEstonia"&gt;Estonia&lt;/a&gt;, which have prospered from a flat tax system, the new 16% tax is expected to ensure higher economic growth, reduce corruption and the grey economy, and encourage greater foreign investment. 

The 16% tax rate has meant that Romania now has one of the most liberal and competitive fiscal policies in Europe, similar to what &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AIreland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; introduced before its &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ACeltic%20Tiger"&gt;Celtic Tiger&lt;/a&gt; period, which resulted in very high growth and development.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARiga%2C%20Latvia"&gt;Riga&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Latvia"&gt;Latvia&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; The Central Bank of &lt;a href="Lithuania"&gt;Lithuania&lt;/a&gt; announced that it plans to adopt the common European currency, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aeuro"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 2007, and replace its national currency, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Alitas"&gt;litas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Lithunia intends to introduce the use of the euro as an official currency on January 1, 2007, where it will be used alongside the litas until January 15. From January 15, the euro would become the only official means of payment.

Lithuania joined the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; in 2004, and like the other new member states, it is obliged to adopt the euro when it is ready. However, in order to adopt the euro, a country must be part of the EU's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AExchange%20Rate%20Mechanism"&gt;Exchange Rate Mechanism II&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (ERM II) for at least two years. During that time, the currency must not fluctuate more than 2.25% in relation to the euro. Additionally, the budget deficit should be under 3% of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Agross%20domestic%20product"&gt;gross domestic product&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Lithunia became part of ERM II in June 2004, meaning that the earliest it could join the euro would be in June 2006. However, its target is 2007, which, at the present moment, seems to be achievable, considering the country's low inflation and budget deficit. The litas has been pegged to the euro, since February 2002, at a rate of 1 euro = 3.45 litas.

So far, only 12 out of the 25 members of the European Union have adoped the euro. However, in the next decade, it is expected that most, if not all, of the ten new member states will adopt the currency. Lithuania is expected to be the first to adopt the currency, in 2007. &lt;a href="Estonia"&gt;Estonia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Slovenia"&gt;Slovenia&lt;/a&gt;, which are the only other new member states that are part of ERM II, are also expected to join the common currency at this time.

Larger countries like &lt;a href="Hungary"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Czechia"&gt;Czechia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Poland"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;, which are not yet part of ERM II, may have to wait until 2010 at least, due to their large budget deficits.

Lithuania has been one of the most enthusiastic new member states concerning European integration. Besides its early adoption of the euro, it was the first country in the EU to ratify the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Constitution"&gt;European Constitution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

<h1>Northeast US blizzards create havoc</h1>
<h2>Blizzard wreaks havoc</h2>
♡❤♡January 24, 2005♡❤♡
In the northeastern corner of the USA, snowstorms have created mayhem as they cover the region with snow and ice. Several cold fronts, which lead to these storms, have spread from the south of the United States to areas like Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New Jersey, just to name the few states with serious blizzard emergencies. Most of the northeast region is covered in powdery whiteness. Up to two feet make transportation virtually impossible, even for air flight. The blizzards have not only wrecked ground transport, but have disrupted thousands of flights. This blizzard was extreme, even by New England standards.

The blizzard also hit Southern states and left four inches of snow in Washington DC.

Iraq – Sami Mohammad Ali Said al-Jaaf, also known as Abu Omar al-Kurdi, accused of many bombings, has said to have been captured by US and Iraqi security forces. He was arrested on the 15th of January, but his arrest has not been revealed until now.

Al-Jaaf was said to have been a threat to security because of his ties to the militant group Zarqawi and his previous criminal record. Interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi's party offices were close to the site of the recent bombing in Baghdad, these bombings were claimed by Zarqawi supporters on their website, but, luckily, Mr Allawi was not in the area at the time of the blast, which happened on Monday.

Iraq – "We have declared a bitter war against the principle of democracy and all those who seek to enact it," the speaker has said in a tape reportedly from Zarqawi. al-Zarqawi has now declared war on the upcoming Iraqi poll, a bad sign for the mission in Iraq.

WASHINTON D.C., USA – (Washington Post) A &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Washington%20Post"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; report reveals a secret intelligence department created by the &lt;a href="w%3APentagon"&gt;Pentagon&lt;/a&gt; "directly responsive to tasking from &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Defense"&gt;Secretary of Defense&lt;/a&gt;" &lt;a href="w%3ADonald%20Rumsfeld"&gt;Donald Rumsfeld&lt;/a&gt;. The report raises questions regarding the legality of the &lt;a href="w%3AStrategic%20Support%20Branch"&gt;Strategic Support Branch&lt;/a&gt;, allegations disputed by Pentagon spokesperson Lawrence T. DiRita:

&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20McCain"&gt;Sen. John McCain&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AArizona"&gt;AZ&lt;/a&gt;) expects the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Armed%20Services"&gt;U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee&lt;/a&gt; to hold hearings on the issue. "I'm always sorry to read about things in The Washington Post when they affect a committee that I am a member of."

Members of congressional intelligence committees were reported as not being aware of the program. Funding of the program was through "reprogrammed" funds, without explicit congressional authority or appropriation.

TAIPEI, Taiwan – Members of the Taiwanese cabinet&amp;mdash;the &lt;a href="w%3AExecutive%20Yuan"&gt;Executive Yuan Council&lt;/a&gt;&amp;mdash;have resigned ♡❤en masse♡❤ to pave way for the new cabinet. It is not expected to cause any major change on Taipei's policy toward &lt;a href="w%3Amainland%20China"&gt;Mainland China&lt;/a&gt;.

"The cabinet has tendered its resignation," Chen Chi-mai, spokesman for the cabinet, told a news conference on Monday. 

The entire 20-member cabinet, including Premier &lt;a href="w%3AYu%20Shyi-Kun"&gt;Yu Shyi-Kun&lt;/a&gt;, tendered its resignation to give President &lt;a href="w%3AChen%20Shui-bian"&gt;Chen Shui-bian&lt;/a&gt; a free hand in choosing a new set of ministers.

The move follows the &lt;a href="w%3AROC%20legislative%20election%2C%202004"&gt;parliamentary election last December&lt;/a&gt;, in which President Chen's &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Progressive%20Party"&gt;Democratic Progressive Party&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href="w%3APan-Green%20Coalition"&gt;allies&lt;/a&gt; failed to win a majority over the rival &lt;a href="w%3APan-Blue%20Coalition"&gt;opposition coalition&lt;/a&gt;, led by the Nationalist Party of China &amp;mdash; also known as &lt;a href="w%3AKuomintang"&gt;Kuomintang (KMT)&lt;/a&gt;.

In Taiwan's political system, the &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;president&lt;/a&gt; is the head of state and appoints the &lt;a href="w%3APremier%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;premier&lt;/a&gt;, who heads the cabinet and runs the day-to-day affairs of government. The premier liaises with parliament (the &lt;a href="w%3ALegislative%20Yuan"&gt;Legislative Yuan&lt;/a&gt;), which has the final say over lawmaking. 

President Chen is expected to name the new premier on Tuesday. Whomever is appointed will form a new cabinet in consultation with Mr. Chen. Mr. Chen is widely expected to name &lt;a href="w%3AFrank%20Hsieh"&gt;Frank Hsieh&lt;/a&gt;, the mayor of &lt;a href="w%3AKaohsiung"&gt;Kaohsiung City&lt;/a&gt; and close ally, to this post. The choice of premier may signal Mr. Chen's desired successor for 2008 when his two-term limit ends. Several key members of the outgoing cabinet are expected to retain their jobs.

Philip Yang, political professor at the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Taiwan%20University"&gt;National Taiwan University&lt;/a&gt;, doesn't expect Taiwan's policy towards the &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; to change much with a new cabinet.

"It is expected that those cabinet members who are in charge of cross-strait relations will remain unchanged. So I believe in terms of policy, there will be no major changes," he said.

Beijing sees Taiwan as a breakaway province and has threatened to attack if &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan%20independence"&gt;independence&lt;/a&gt; is declared. Pro-independence supporters, such as Mr. Chen, maintain there are two countries. The two sides split amid &lt;a href="w%3AChinese%20Civil%20War"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt; when the Communists established the People's Republic of China on the mainland while the Nationalists moved their government to Taiwan and maintained the seat of the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20of%20China"&gt;Republic of China&lt;/a&gt;, which the Communists regard as defunct and illegitimate. 

Mr. Chen won re-election in last year's &lt;a href="w%3AROC%20presidential%20election%2C%202004"&gt;presidential election&lt;/a&gt; by a narrow margin, but his pro-independence party then failed to gain a majority in the December parliamentary elections as had previously been predicted. 

Analysts suggest the military threat and the growing economic relationships between the two sides swayed Taiwan's voters to not provoke Beijing. Professor Yang thinks if there are going to be changes in Taiwan's new cabinet policy towards mainland China, it will result from public pressure to reduce tensions.

"In terms of policy there will be no major changes, but definitely some pressure from the people and from the parliament," he said. "[They] would ask the government to be more active to improve cross-strait relations."

The new cabinet will take office on February 1, along with the new parliament.

THE PENTAGON, Washington DC – 
The &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; Defense Secretary &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADonald%20Rumsfeld"&gt;Donald Rumsfeld&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; will not attend high-profile talks on international defense policy at the Munich Security Conference claiming prior commitments. Rumsfeld will send Douglas J. Feith, the Undersecretary of Defense, instead, to discuss such items as the &lt;a href="E.U."&gt;E.U.&lt;/a&gt; and U.S. stances on &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;.

Rumsfeld previously stated that he would not attend the conference unless &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; voided a complaint from the New York-based &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACenter%20for%20Constitutional%20Rights"&gt;Center for Constitutional Rights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , asking German authorities to prosecute him for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Awar%20crime"&gt;war crimes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The group filed the complaint last December with the Federal German Prosecutor's Office, accusing Rumsfeld of war crimes and torture in connection with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Ghraib%20torture%20and%20prisoner%20abuse"&gt;Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

German legislation allows prosecution for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide regardless of where the crime occurred or of the nationality of the accused.

BEIJING – 
A &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; court has handed stiff sentences to 27 farmers who protested the confiscation of their fields. The sentences come as the government struggles to deal with a rising tide of sometimes violent protests by farmers angry over what they allege are illegal land seizures by government-backed developers. 

For months, a group of farmers camped outside the local headquarters of the &lt;a href="w%3ACommunist%20Party%20of%20China"&gt;Communist Party&lt;/a&gt; in Sanchawan village, in China's &lt;a href="w%3AShaanxi"&gt;Shaanxi&lt;/a&gt; province. The farmers were protesting plans by developers to seize their land and pay only $60 each in compensation.

The farmers said the compensation from the government-backed developers was too small, and the seizure was illegal.

Five months into the sit-in, paramilitary police descended on the village and arrested the group for charges including obstructing traffic and attacking government agencies. The detainees' sentencing came last week. Relatives of those arrested say some received sentences of two to six years, while a man accused of leading the demonstration was ordered to spend 15 years in prison. 

The sentencing has drawn protests from overseas &lt;a href="w%3AHuman%20rights%20in%20China"&gt;human rights&lt;/a&gt; advocates like Nicholas Becquelin of the New York-based Human Rights in China group, who says the government has recently tried to stop the protests from spreading by imposing a general ban on news coverage of land seizures. 

He said the authorities are hoping the stiff sentences will discourage others from protesting.

"The government is sending a message to petitioners and protesters, saying that if they resort to this kind of demonstrations that the Communist party does not allow, they will be seriously punished," said Mr. Becquelin.

&lt;a href="w%3AEconomy%20of%20China"&gt;China's economy&lt;/a&gt; is booming and cases like the one in Shaanxi province are becoming more common, with more peasants losing their farmland to make way for development projects backed by local governments.

Officials estimate 70 million people have lost their land to the construction of roads, dams, housing projects and factories. Analysts predict that number will continue rising as the economy continues to expand.

As the economy grows, so do the disparities between rich and poor. The central government says the latest figures, from the year 2003, show farmers' per capita disposable income totaled about a third of that of urban dwellers. 

Despite the government's assertion last year that rural incomes are growing, many of China's 800 million farmers live in deep poverty. Under China's socialist system, farmers cannot own the land they till, but rather lease it from the state. Plots are small and yield barely enough for families to eat. 

Local officials have the power to make decisions on the land, leaving peasants little recourse should the officials choose to seize their plots. 

Anger at the seizures has fueled desperation among peasants who complain they have not benefited from China's economic growth in the same way as people along the industrialized East Coast. 

Some demonstrations have turned deadly. Last November, government troops opened fire and killed a number of protesters in a remote part of Sichuan province, where thousands of residents were protesting the seizure of their land for construction of a hydroelectric dam project.

The picture was taken from Mars orbit with the Mars Orbiter Camera
on board the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMars%20Global%20Surveyor"&gt;♡❤Mars Global Surveyor♡❤&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The image was captured on April 26, 2004,
Opportunity's 91st martian day. The rover was on its way to
Endurance Crater.
Also visible and labeled on this image are the spacecraft's
lander, backshell, parachute and heat shield, plus effects of its
landing rockets.

The camera captured this image with use of a technique called
compensated pitch and roll targeted observation. In this method,
the entire spacecraft rolls as it passes over the target area so
the camera can scan in a way that sees details at three times
higher resolution than the camera's normal high-resolution
capability.

Sunlight illuminates the scene from the left. North is toward the
top of the image. The 100-meter scale bar is 109 yards long.

<h2>Pentagon's Strategic Support Teams Spark Controversy</h2>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Pentagon%20to%20explain%2C%20or%20deny%2C%20new%20spy%20plan&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A recent article in the Washington Post revealed the existence of a new type of battlefield intelligence group, referred to by the Pentagon as "Strategic Support Teams". The military in the field are using these units to improve their intelligence gathering capabilities. 

The news of the existence of these units has sparked controversy over the manner in which they were created as well as the manner in which they are used. According to the original report in the Washington Post, these units have been in operation for two years. They deploy small teams of caseworkers, linguists, interrogators and technical specialists to work alongside Special Operations forces. This is readily acknowledged by the Pentagon. 

However, there is some dispute as to the accuracy of other items mentioned in the Washington Post report. According to the Post, the units were designed to report directly to Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfield, and use "reprogrammed" funds, or funds not appropriated with Congressional authority or oversight.

The Pentagon, however, denies these accusations. In a statement made by Pentagon spokesman Lawrence DiRita, "There is no unit that is directly reportable to the Secretary of Defense for clandestine operations as is described in The Washington Post". Mr. DiRita went on to say, "Further, the Department is not attempting to 'bend' statutes to fit desired activities, as is suggested in this article."

Pentagon officials told reporters that the funding and other arrangements for these new units had been worked out in close coordination with the CIA and that appropriate congressional committees had been fully informed. One defense department official explained that part of the reason for the controversy might be that lawmakers contacted by the Post or other news organizations for information may not have recognized the new name given to the units, "Strategic Support Teams". According to this official, when these lawmakers were originally briefed on these new intelligence units they were referred to as "Humint Augmentation Teams" (Humint is short for Human Intelligence, referring to information gathered by human operatives). The Pentagon later changed the official name of the units to Strategic Support Teams. The official spoke on the condition that he not be identified.

Many Democrats, such as Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif) and Rep. Ellen Tauscher (D-Calif) are calling for congressional hearings to investigate the matter. 

"While I fully support improving the ability of our men and women in the field to get accurate real time intelligence, the creation of this unit raises a number of questions that this committee has a duty to examine," Tauscher said. 

Many Republican lawmakers have stated their opposition to such hearings, such as the Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif).

"The notion by some that various steps taken by the Department of Defense to enhance such intelligence is somehow sinister and illegitimate is nonsense," Hunter said. 

The Undersecretary of Defense, Stephen A. Cambone, met with the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, John Warner (R-Va) and the panel's top Democrat, Carl Levin (D-Mi) for more than an hour on Monday. Warner said he was satisfied by the briefing and would ensure that other committee members were briefed fully as well. 

"In my opinion," he said, "these intelligence programs are vital to our national security interests, and I am satisfied that they are being coordinated with the appropriate agencies of the federal government."

If it is true that the requirements of scrupulous indexing and searching of files have been relaxed to the point of making subjective the process of retrieving them, it is a violation of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), which states that the public may view files of the unclassified category. From the perspective of the FBI, as deduced from their arguments in the case, the burden of doing complete searches is unreasonable. 

Currently, only indexes of the files are searched in response to requests based on the FOIA. A lawsuit filed by the brother of a deceased federal inmate claimed that his specific request turned up no results, despite the proven existence of the files relating to the case against his brother, and the circumstances leading up to his death in prison, which was ruled a suicide despite the appearance of a violent death.

Critics of the government case, from the fields of journalism and academic law, contend that it is possible that the transferring of files from paper to electronic records is being used as an excuse to avoid doing complete searches that may turn up evidence of official wrongdoing.

HOLLYWOOD, California – Academy Award®-winning actor Tim Robbins has been tapped to present at the 77th Academy Awards®, telecast producer Gil Cates announced today.

Robbins received his first acting Oscar last year at the 76th Academy Awards, for his supporting role in Mystic River. In 1995, he received a nomination for directing Dead Man Walking. Robbins is currently filming War of the Worlds and will be seen next in The Secret Life of Words.

Meanwhile, Documentary category rules for the 78th Annual Academy Awards® have been changed by the Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to exempt documentaries "with a true theatrical rollout" from the rules' television blackout provision. 

The change will apply to documentaries released during the 2005 Academy Awards year. 

Documentary branch executive committee chair Freida Lee Mock said the theatrical exhibition requirements of the rules for the documentary awards were instituted in 2003 at the branch's request to encourage commercial theatrical runs for documentary films. 

"Our new rules had a positive impact," Mock said. "Since 2003 there have been a growing number of documentary theatrical releases, and that growth exploded this summer." 

But some of the films bumped up against the television blackout provisions of the rule and were thereby prevented from having a television exhibition until a nine-month time period had expired. 

The Academy isn't trying to prevent television exhibition for documentaries that have had a successful theatrical run, Mock said, "but we want documentaries to be able to exploit their theatrical release as fully as possible, so we've modified the rules to exempt those documentaries from the blackout provisions." Even for documentaries with more modest theatrical runs, the 2005 rules reduce the blackout window to six months. 

To qualify for exemption a film must have had a minimum of 25 commercial exhibitions for paid admission in motion picture theaters in 15 states, each exhibition to be at least two consecutive days. (Exhibitions held at festivals, benefits, special events and the like do not qualify under this provision.) 

The 2005 rules also contain a provision requiring that short documentaries "must be contractually available for theatrical release for six months after receiving a nomination" unless they have met the test for the new blackout exemption.

A process that would normally take millions of years, scientists have mimicked within a couple of days. Today, researchers at the have turned wood mineral by the process of soaking poplar and pine in a chemical mix and then cooking them. The team of scientists accomplishing this feat, led by Yongsoon Shin, bought pine and poplar boards and performed a series of steps. The first step leading to the petrifying of the wood is thinly cutting it, then soaking it in acids and a silica solution, after that, heating it, and lastly, cooling the product in argon. Silica takes up a bond with the carbon left in the wood's cellulose, creating silicon carbide, widely known as a ceramic.

TAIPEI, Taiwan – Taiwanese President &lt;a href="w%3AChen%20Shui-bian"&gt;Chen Shui-bian&lt;/a&gt; has chosen &lt;a href="w%3AFrank%20Hsieh"&gt;Frank Hsieh&lt;/a&gt;, a leading member of his pro-independence &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Progressive%20Party"&gt;Democratic Progressive Party&lt;/a&gt;, as the new &lt;a href="w%3APremier%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;Premier of the Republic of China&lt;/a&gt;.

Frank Hsieh replaces &lt;a href="w%3AYu%20Shyi-kun"&gt;Yu Shyi-kun&lt;/a&gt;, who served as Taiwan's premier for three years. Mr. Yu and the entire 20-member cabinet resigned Monday to allow President Chen Shui-bian to reshuffle the cabinet, after his party's &lt;a href="w%3APan-Green%20Coaliton"&gt;coalition&lt;/a&gt; lost &lt;a href="w%3AROC%20legislative%20election%2C%202004"&gt;parliamentary elections&lt;/a&gt; last month.

Mr. Hsieh, the 59-year-old mayor of Taiwan's second largest city, Kaohsiung, is a close ally of Mr. Chen and will be expected to closely carry out the president's agenda. Mr. Hsieh served as Chairman of the Democratic Progressive Party from 2000 to 2002.

President Chen praised Mr. Hsieh as "the best person" to help open a new era of negotiations with both the opposition and with Mainland China. 

Analysts suggest that Mr. Chen's appointment may signal President Chen's preference for a successor. Mr. Chen's second term ends in 2008 and Mr. Hsieh has had previous experience as a vice presidential candidate in &lt;a href="w%3AROC%20presidential%20election%2C%201996"&gt;1996&lt;/a&gt;.

In ways, the two men are alike. Both grew up in poor families, graduated from Taiwan's most prestigious &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Taiwan%20University"&gt;National Taiwan University&lt;/a&gt;, and passed the bar with the highest score in their junior years in college. Like President Chen, Mr. Hsieh rose to prominence defending the dissidents of the &lt;a href="w%3AKaohsiung%20Incident"&gt;Kaohsiung Incident&lt;/a&gt; and went on to serve as a Taipei city councilor and a legislator.

Mr. Hsieh is expected to announce a new &lt;a href="w%3AExecutive%20Yuan"&gt;cabinet&lt;/a&gt; in two days. The cabinet must be endorsed by the new &lt;a href="w%3ALegislative%20Yuan"&gt;parliament&lt;/a&gt;, which convenes February 1. 

Analysts believe that many key ministers, including those responsible for foreign affairs, defense, and mainland affairs, are likely to retain their posts.

Mr. Hsieh on Tuesday promised to seek co-existence and "cross-strait peace" through dialogue with the &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt;. He said the new cabinet must maintain cross-strait stability. He will also need to smooth the economic recovery.

He will have to face a parliament in which the opposition holds 114 of the 225 seats. Mr. Chen has complained that passage of his key bills have been slowed by the parliament.

The pro-independence policies of President Chen and his Democratic Progressive Party have angered Beijing, which considers Taiwan a breakaway province. Beijing has threatened a military attack if the &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan%20independence"&gt;Taiwan independence&lt;/a&gt; is declared. The two sides split amid &lt;a href="w%3AChinese%20Civil%20War"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt; in 1949 when the Communists established the People's Republic and the &lt;a href="w%3AKuomintang"&gt;Nationalist Party&lt;/a&gt;, or Kuomintang, moved the original government to Taiwan where they maintained the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20of%20China"&gt;Republic of China&lt;/a&gt;, which Beijing regards as defunct. President Chen maintains there are two countries.

The Kuomintang favors maintaining the status quo. Party leaders say the question of whether Taiwan should be independent or reunited with mainland China should be decided by future generations. The Kuomintang, citing its parliamentary victory, had sought to name its own premier and government.

Philip Yang, an associate professor of political science at National Taiwan University, says the recent election's message was that the president and his new premier will have to pay serious attention to relations with Beijing.

"A new message from the people [is] demanding the government to pay more attention to enhance cross-straits interaction," he said.

&lt;a href="w%3AAuckland%2C%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Auckland, New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; – On &lt;a href="January%2025"&gt;January 25&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="2005"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADon%20Brash"&gt;Don Brash&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20National%20Party"&gt;National Party&lt;/a&gt; made a speech to the &lt;a href="w%3AOrewa"&gt;Orewa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ARotary%20Club"&gt;Rotary Club&lt;/a&gt; where he focussed upon welfare dependency. He pledged to reduce the number of working-age beneficiaries from the current figure of 300 000 to 200 000 over ten years. His particular target was the 109 000 solo parents on the Domestic Purposes Benefit (DPB). Brash suggested a greater role for adoption in reducing this number, and also hinted that mothers who did not name the father, or who had another child while already on the DPB, may be penalised. Brash's advocacy of adopting children out has lead to a number of attacks, Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AHelen%20Clark"&gt;Helen Clark&lt;/a&gt; responded by saying "I think we need to support people to keep their babies".

<h2>Background</h2>
New Zealand will hold a &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20general%20election%202005"&gt;general election&lt;/a&gt; this year, most likely in September. The National Party is trailing the governing &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Labour%20Party"&gt;Labour Party&lt;/a&gt; by about 14% in the polls, but last year it polled better than the Labour Party following a speech on race relations by Don Brash at the same location a year earlier. This speech is gearing-up the National Party and setting policies in the build-up to the election.
New Zealand under went significant welfare reform during the early 1990s under a National government, with a 25% cut in benefits at the 1991 'Mother of all Budgets' by &lt;a href="w%3ARuth%20Richardson"&gt;Ruth Richardson&lt;/a&gt;. The current Labour government (1999-) has restored some of the previous benefit levels.

SÃO PAULO, &lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; – The &lt;a href="w%3ALandless%20Workers%27%20Movement"&gt;Landless Workers Movement (MST)&lt;/a&gt; inaugurated on Sunday the school Florestan Fernandes created by the movement. The &lt;a href="http%3A//www.mst.org.br/multimidia/gfotos/escola%2520nacional/enff.htm"&gt;school&lt;/a&gt; is located at the city of &lt;a href="w%3AGuararema"&gt;Guararema&lt;/a&gt;, 60Km (37.282 miles) from &lt;a href="w%3AS%C3%A3o%20Paulo"&gt;São Paulo&lt;/a&gt; and is about 30,000formula_1. Its estimated cost was about US$ 1,3 million, the money coming from the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANon-governmental%20organization"&gt;NGO&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; and the MST's own finances.

The inauguration was attended by the Brazilian Minister of the Agrarian Development Miguel Rosseto, Venezuelan Education and Culture Ministeries delegates, the writer Fernando Morais among other international guests.

According to the MST the proposed courses for the school are: professorship and pedagogy (teaching), collective administration expert, general farming, movement leadership, and Human and Social Sciences.

João Pedro Stédile, a leader of the MST &lt;a href="http%3A//www.vermelho.org.br/diario/2005/0124/0124_escola.asp"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;:
"This school is for taking the power for the workers. So that the friends transform the scientific knowledge into instrument of liberation and not of exploitation, as they do."
He also said: 
"Our enemies are the large farmers, the imperialism, the multinationals, the bankers, the capitalist exploitation and the ignorance. Against them we fight." According to him the school has an ideological function.

<h2>Critics</h2>
The Brazilian Rural Society (Sociedade Rural Brasileira-SRB) President criticized the inauguration of the school. He said “is absurd that Brazilian Courts accept the creation of a school which will teach desrespect for the Law. Instead of the Executive being there joining them, it should do something so the Law gets obeyed.” According to him the pedagody that will be followed by the MST school is concerning since it is attached to old revolutionary ideologies. He accused MST of teaching guerrilla techniques to children.

According to the President of the União Democrática Ruralista (UDR) Luiz Antonio Nabhan Garcia, representant of the farmers, the government of the President &lt;a href="w%3ALuiz%20Inacio%20Lula%20da%20Silva"&gt;Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva&lt;/a&gt; gets perverted upon the society when it supports a school which teaches invading lands. “In a country like ours, poor in education, is not acceptable that the government supports a group which acts against the Law and indoctrinates anachronistic ideologies of &lt;a href="w%3AChe%20Guevara"&gt;Che Guevara&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AFidel%20Castro"&gt;Fidel Castro&lt;/a&gt;”, he added.

♡❤Wikinews Staff Reports♡❤ – The following stories made international headlines today:

<h3>&lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; celebrates 56th Republic Day</h3>

&lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; today celebrated its 56th Republic Day. 

President APJ Abdul Kalam took the salute at the parade. The national flag was hoisted and the armed forces and paramilitary units carried out march-pasts at Rajpath in &lt;a href="New%20Delhi"&gt;New Delhi&lt;/a&gt;. 

<h3>Death toll rises in Indian stampede</h3>

Focus is on relief work as the death toll nears 300 persons killed in a stampede and fire during the popular annual pilgrimmage to the Mandher Devi temple southeast of &lt;a href="Bombay"&gt;Bombay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;.

<h3>&lt;a href="US%20White%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; predicts $427 billion deficit</h3>

The record-shattering estimate is "conservative", and higher than the Budget Office's number of 328 billion &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20dollar"&gt;USD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The Budget Office's long-term predictions suggest deficit spending will taper off by 2012, but (as with their projection of the current deficit spending) it does not include costs of war. President Bush's 2006 budget is expected at the Capitol on Feb. 7, and it too will not include requests for war funds; those are expected in separate funding requests as they were in 2004.

&lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;i Prime Minister &lt;a href="Ariel%20Sharon"&gt;Ariel Sharon&lt;/a&gt; has decided to re-open diplomatic contact with the leader of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APalestinian%20National%20Authority"&gt;Palestinian National Authority&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Mahmoud%20Abbas"&gt;Mahmoud Abbas&lt;/a&gt;.

Sharon had cut all links after a suicide attack killed six Israelis at a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGaza%20Strip"&gt;Gaza Strip&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; border entry point, just days after Abbas has been elected leader. However, Abbas has made moves to curb the activities of Palestinian militants, leading to a drop in violence in the region.

Palestinian officials say that Palestinian security forces will be deployed in the southern Gaza Strip within 24 hours to reduce attacks on Israel. In addition, Israel has agreed to stop the targeted killing of Palestinian militants, reports say.

&lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;U.S. President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; has asked the &lt;a href="w%3ACongress%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;U.S. Congress&lt;/a&gt; for an additional &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;80bn to pay for the on-going military operations in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAfghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;.

This is on top of $25bn approved by Congress last summer in the fiscal defense appropriations bill for 2005. Bush states that this money is to provide U.S. troops with "whatever they need to protect themselves" and also to fight terrorism in Iraq.

The money will support the 'global war on terror' until September 30, 2005. Of the $80bn, $75bn will be spent on the repair and replacement of equipment, training of the Iraqi security forces, and basic personnel costs.

The remaining $5bn will be used to fund &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20State"&gt;State Department&lt;/a&gt; embassy construction, activities in Iraq, and humanitarian operations in &lt;a href="w%3ADarfur"&gt;Darfur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt;.

Commander Leroy Chiao and Flight Engineer Salizhan Sharipov have just completed their mission's first &lt;a href="w%3AExtra-vehicular%20activity"&gt;space walk&lt;/a&gt; aboard the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Space%20Station"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt;. The mission lasted 5 hours, 28 minutes, ending at 1311 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;.
The two astronauts, working in Russian space suits, performed a variety of tasks. Chiao and Sharipov installed a work platform, called the Universal Work Platform, along with its base and associated wiring. They also installed a commercial robotics experiment and a biological experiment on the exterior of the Zvezda Service Module. In addition, they checked vents on systems that help control the Station's atmosphere and relocated a Japanese physical science experiment.

Residue accumulation around the vents of the &lt;a href="w%3AElektron"&gt;Elektron&lt;/a&gt; oxygen generator was noted and photographed by Sharipov. Technicians on the ground will analyze the information to determine if this residue has been contributing to the problematic operation of the Elektron.

During this spacewalk, the station again encountered the mysterious forces that have been saturating the Control Moment Gyros during previous spacewalks. Russian thrusters were activated to counter this force.

The walk marks Chiao's fifth for 31 hours, 34 minutes, accumulated time and Shapirov's first.

This was the 57th space walk conducted at the Station and the 32nd to be based out of the orbital outpost. Expedition 10 is scheduled to conduct its second spacewalk in March.

<h1>White House cuts Hubble from budget</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=White%20House%20cuts%20Hubble%20from%20budget&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
A senior administration official, speaking anonymously, confirmed on Friday that the proposed &lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; budget for the 2006 fiscal year will not contain additional funding for a Hubble servicing mission. The budget plan is to be announced Feb. 7.

The &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; eliminated funding for a service mission the &lt;a href="w%3AHubble%20Space%20Telescope"&gt;Hubble Space Telescope&lt;/a&gt; from its 2006 budget request and directed NASA to focus on deorbiting the spacecraft at the end of its life, according to government and industry sources &lt;a href="http%3A//msnbc.msn.com/id/6853009/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Intensive work has been under way at NASA's &lt;a href="w%3AGoddard%20Space%20Flight%20Center"&gt;Goddard Space Flight Center&lt;/a&gt; to develop telerobotic servicing skills for the Hubble Space Telescope in the event that a space shuttle crew is never again sent to the orbiting facility. Aerospace firms in the United States and in Canada have teamed with NASA to develop a Hubble Robotic Vehicle Deorbit Module.

"Excellent progress is being made on a telerobotic approach to servicing the Hubble," said Jim Crocker, vice president of civil space at Lockheed Martin Space Systems of Denver. The firm has supported NASA's planning and, later, the repair and servicing of the HST with four &lt;a href="w%3Aspace%20shuttle"&gt;space shuttle&lt;/a&gt; missions to date.

The telerobotics team at work at Goddard Space Flight Center "have a good shot at pulling this off," Crocker told SPACE.com the day before the Space News story on the White House HST decision appeared
&lt;a href="http%3A//edition.cnn.com/2005/TECH/space/01/24/hubble.funding/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

The estimated $1 billion plus cost for a robotic or shuttle servicing mission is considered too high by the White House in light of higher priority missions such as the shuttle "return to flight" project and NASA's "moon, Mars and beyond &lt;a href="http%3A//www.usatoday.com/tech/science/space/2005-01-24-hubble-battle_x.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;."

The anonymous U.S. official told Reuters the estimated cost of a robotic repair was $2 billion and one feasibility study gave it an 80 percent chance of failure
&lt;a href="http%3A//wireservice.wired.com/wired/story.asp%3Fsection%3DBreaking%26amp%3BstoryId%3D979345%26amp%3Btw%3Dwn_wire_story"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

"Hubble is in year 14 of a planned 15-year mission," the official said. "Trying to send a robotic mission to extend that time period would be a $2 billion gamble with taxpayer dollars where the odds are 80-20 that it would fail."

Congressman Steny Hoyer (D-MD) released the following statement January 25 condemning reports about eliminating funds to repair the Hubble Space Telescope. The Hubble Space Telescope is managed by the Goddard Space Flight Center which is located in Congressman Hoyer's district.

"I am very concerned about reports that the Bush Administration may eliminate federal funds to repair and upgrade the Hubble Space Telescope from its budget for fiscal year 2006. Since its launch in 1990, the Hubble Telescope's state of the art technology has dramatically changed our understanding of the universe and produced thousands of extraordinary discoveries

A &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Marine%20Corps"&gt;U.S. Marine&lt;/a&gt; transport &lt;a href="w%3ACH-53E%20Super%20Stallion"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt; has crashed in western &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, killing 31. Although there was bad weather reported in the area, &lt;a href="w%3ACBC"&gt;CBC&lt;/a&gt; quotes an anonymous official as stating, "I have not heard anybody attribute a cause."

The helicopter went down at 1:20 a.m. local time near Rutbah, about 355 km west of &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;, while conducting security operations. The aircraft was transporting personnel from &lt;a href="w%3AUS%201st%20Marine%20Division"&gt;1st Marine Division&lt;/a&gt;. Rescue and investigative teams are on the scene.

The event may be the largest loss of life since the invasion in 2003. On March 23, 2003, during the initial invasion, 26 soldiers lost their lives in various incidents. Since Pres. &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush&lt;/a&gt; declared major operations over on May 1, 2003 there have been several events with large loss of life, including the collision of two &lt;a href="w%3AUH-60%20Black%20Hawk"&gt;Black Hawk&lt;/a&gt; helicopters while avoiding ground fire, killing 17, and a &lt;a href="w%3ACH-47%20Chinook"&gt;Chinook&lt;/a&gt; which was shot down near &lt;a href="w%3AFallujah"&gt;Fallujah&lt;/a&gt;.

The U.S. military reports, for Wednesday January 25th, four U.S. Marines from the 1st Marine Expeditionary Unit were killed in action in &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Anbar"&gt;al Anbar&lt;/a&gt;. An &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Army"&gt;Army&lt;/a&gt; soldier with the 1st Infantry Division was killed when a combat patrol was attacked near Duluiyah. A series of car bombs and attacks resulted in at least six deaths in Iraq and more wounded, including at least seven U.S. military personnel.

Ten people are dead and up to 200 injured after three trains crashed in Glendale, a suburb of Los Angeles. 

Two passenger trains and a freight train carrying gravel collided at 6:05 a.m. local time during the morning rush hour. Both passenger trains were double-decker Metrolink trains, one northbound from Union Station, the other southbound. One train overturned, and the other caught fire.

The northbound train normally carries 30 to 50 passengers. The southbound train normally has 200 to 250 people on board.

Over 300 firefighters are attending the scene.

The chief of police of Glendale reported at a press conference that a man trying to commit suicide drove his car onto the train tracks, but apparently changed his mind and left the vehicle before the impact, leaving the vehicle on the tracks. The suspect was taken into custody by police officers who arrived at the scene of the accident and has, according to the police, already admitted driving the vehicle onto the tracks.

WASHINGTON (AP) The Senate on Wednesday overwhelmingly confirmed Condoleezza Rice as secretary of state after a host of Democrats harshly criticized Bush administration Iraq policy. The expectation of Rice becoming the Secretary of State, like many presumed, has come true.

Santa Clara, CALIFORNIA – Computer vendor &lt;a href="w%3ASun%20Microsystems"&gt;Sun Microsystems&lt;/a&gt; released on Tuesday the first offerings of its OpenSolaris operating system code for free, under a license which allows anyone to use or work on the code and distribute the changes they make..

The full operating system is expected to be released for download sometime in the second quarter of 2005. Following along with the system source code are 1,670 &lt;a href="w%3Apatent"&gt;patents&lt;/a&gt; Sun will make available for use by open-source developers. Sun hopes to leverage greater innovation in software from the &lt;a href="w%3Aopen%20source"&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt; community, in return for allowing the code to be used without charge.

"This is not an EOL (end of life) release. It's a supercharged, turbocharged rocket launching," Sun CEO &lt;a href="w%3AScottMcNealy"&gt;Scott McNealy&lt;/a&gt; said. "No one else has done what we have just done."

The move follows a &lt;a href="IBM%20Releases%20500%20patents%20to%20open%20source%20community"&gt;recent move&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="w%3AIBM"&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt; to grant use of 500 patents freely to open source software developers. Open source developers had been becoming concerned that bureaucracy and legal issues associated with &lt;a href="w%3Asoftware%20patents"&gt;software patents&lt;/a&gt; could be damaging to their livelihoods and to innovation. The moves by Sun and IBM seem intended to placate this growing fear.

Dynamic Trace, or DTrace is the first OpenSolaris component to be released. DTrace is a performance-analysis tool that tells developers how to optimize their applications for maximum performance. 

The code is to be released under Sun's own licensing scheme, the &lt;a href="w%3ACommon%20Development%20and%20Distribution%20License"&gt;Common Development and Distribution License&lt;/a&gt; (CDDL) Version 1.0. This license has been approved by the &lt;a href="w%3AOpen%20Source%20Initiative"&gt;Open Source Initiative&lt;/a&gt; (OSI).

Sun's license is based on the &lt;a href="w%3AMozilla%20Public%20License"&gt;Mozilla Public License&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="w%3AFree%20Software%20Foundation"&gt;Free Software Foundation&lt;/a&gt; has stated on its website that Sun's license, while free, is not compatible with the &lt;a href="w%3AGPL"&gt;GNU Public License&lt;/a&gt; (GPL) used for the popular open source &lt;a href="w%3ALinux"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; operating system. This does not mean that Linux software and OpenSolaris software cannot be used together, but limits the extent of integration which may be achieved.

Sun had previously allowed free use of the operating system &lt;a href="w%3ASolaris%20Operating%20Environment"&gt;Solaris&lt;/a&gt; by some users, for example students. This move greatly extends the range of free uses permitted, and allows users to read and modify the source code without charge or non-disclosure agreement.

Results published in the science journal &lt;a href="w%3ANature%20%28journal%29"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt; suggest previous &lt;a href="w%3AIntergovernmental%20Panel%20on%20Climate%20Change"&gt;Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change&lt;/a&gt; (IPCC) predictions will need to be revised upwards.

Climateprediction.net has released it's first results, indicating that global temperatures could rise by up to 11° C, even if global carbon dioxide levels are limited to twice those found before the &lt;a href="w%3AIndustrial%20Revolution"&gt;Industrial Revolution&lt;/a&gt;; levels that high are expected to be reached in the middle of this century.

The results indicate that carbon dioxide emissions will have an even bigger affect on the global climate than previously thought.

The &lt;a href="http%3A//climateprediction.net"&gt;Climateprediction.net&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href="w%3ADistributed%20computing"&gt;distributed computing&lt;/a&gt; project. More than 95,000 people around the world have downloaded the software which runs calculations when the user's computer is idle, releasing computer power greater than that of even the largest supercomputers.

The project is a collaboration between several UK universities and the &lt;a href="w%3AMet%20Office"&gt;Met Office&lt;/a&gt;, funded by the &lt;a href="w%3ANatural%20Environment%20Research%20Council"&gt;British Natural Environment Research Council&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Trade%20and%20Industry"&gt;Department of Trade and Industry&lt;/a&gt;. In the summer of 2004 the project joined forces with the &lt;a href="w%3ASETI"&gt;SETI&lt;/a&gt; program, with &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20California"&gt;University of California&lt;/a&gt; computer scientists developing a version of the SETI software to run climate change models.

The &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Space%20Agency"&gt;European Space Agency's&lt;/a&gt; (ESA) lunar probe &lt;a href="w%3ASmart%201"&gt;SMART-1&lt;/a&gt; has taken its first images from a low orbit around the moon, returning images of great detail. SMART-1 caps a streak of major planetary missions by the ESA in the past year.

Two features of SMART-1 have brought particular attention to the project: the &lt;a href="w%3AIon%20thruster"&gt;ion drive&lt;/a&gt; and a sophisticated navigational software.

The probe features a low-thrust, long-duration ion drive, where ionised particles are accelerated by electromagnets and ejected from the motor of the probe to provide propulsion. The energy for this is supplied by solar panels, potentially allowing months of thrusting.

The probe arrived in lunar orbit on November 15, 2004. The ion drive has been firing for much of the time since, leading the probe to orbit ever closer to the lunar surface.

The coupling of the camera and the navigational system will allow more precise mapping of the moon's features than ever before. Using very precise positioning, the system will be able to measure the angles of shadows to such a degree that researchers will be able to build a very accurate topographical map of the moon's surface features.

The series of images were taken at an altitude of 5,000 to 1,000 km above the Moon to test the onboard camera. On February 9, the ion drive will be turned on once more to drop the probe to a height of 3,000 to 300 km above the surface. From then on, it will begin the bulk of its scientific investigations.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;United States Senate&lt;/a&gt; has voted to accept &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W.

Eighty-five Senators voted to approve her accession while 13 opposed it. Two Senators did not vote.

&lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Democratic&lt;/a&gt; Senators had criticised her during debates on the nomination, but this did not prevent her gaining the second-highest ever number of votes for a nominee for Secretary of State.

The former head of National Security replaces &lt;a href="w%3AColin%20Powell"&gt;Colin Powell&lt;/a&gt;, who became the highest-serving African American in U.S. history when he became Secretary of State in 2000.

Ms Rice is expected to be sworn into office in the &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; later this evening, with a more elaborate public ceremony on Friday, and to begin her new role on Thursday morning.

It discuss strategies to fight back against the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aliberalism"&gt;neo-liberalism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acapitalism"&gt;capitalism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aimperialism"&gt;imperialism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . According to the organizers "The World Social Forum is an open meeting place where groups and movements of civil society opposed to neo-liberalism and a world dominated by capital or by any form of imperialism, but engaged in building a planetary society centred on the human person, come together to pursue their thinking, to debate ideas democratically, for formulate proposals, share their experiences freely and network for effective action."

Just under 6000 different groups and organizations will participate in the six day event which joins discussions, protests and festivals. 

Both the Brazilian president &lt;a href="Luiz%20In%C3%A1cio%20Lula%20da%20Silva"&gt;Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Venezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;n president &lt;a href="Hugo%20Ch%C3%A1vez"&gt;Hugo Chávez&lt;/a&gt; are to be guests at the forum; however the reception of the two leaders is set to be quite different. Da Silva (commonly referred to as Lula) has faced criticism from the leftists set to make up the majority of participants at the forum due to the allegedly weak results of the government social politics and the way the government conducts the Economy. This is in stark contrast to the reception that he received at the 2003 forum (also in Porto Alegre), where he was hailed as a hero.

Hugo Chávez on the other hand is set to receive a warmer welcome for enforcing a 2001 law allowing for the expropriation of idle agricultural land from large estates. However, the government of Venezuela has also received criticism for what some feel to be intimidation of journalists and other anti-democratic acts.

This year the event has been tarnished by the Brazilian journalist Políbio Braga, who alleges illicit negotiations between the World Social Forum and GP Equipamentos Elétricos Ltd, a Brazilian company contracted to work on the infrastructure for the forum. He also accuses the Brazilian government of trying to stop the police investigation into the matter.

In 2006 the forum is scheduled to be held in Venezuela and/or simultaneously in different cities around the world.

<h3>China detains and beats mourners of purged leader Zhao Ziyang</h3>

The government of &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; has detained several people who were mourning the passing of former communist party leader, &lt;a href="w%3AZhao%20Ziyang"&gt;Zhao Ziyang&lt;/a&gt;. Mr. Zhao was the former Communist Party secretary general who purged for opposing the 1989 military crackdown on the Tiananmen Square student movement. He died two weeks ago at age 85, having spent the last fifteen years of his life under house arrest. At least three people were beaten during the arrests today, according to reports from the &lt;a href="w%3AAgence%20France-Presse"&gt;AFP&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AMeadow%20Lake%2C%20Saskatchewan"&gt;Meadow Lake, Saskatchewan&lt;/a&gt; – 
The municipal council of a small town in Canada's Prairies has said it "accidentally" donated $10,000 to the Red Cross for tsunami relief. Now it wants its money back.

The council approved the donation during a Jan. 10 meeting by 3 votes to 2. However, the mayor was in the hospital and the deputy mayor, Barry Lewis, who substituted didn't realize he could vote. If he had voted, it would have been against the donation.

Some townspeople accused councillor Dorothy Lockwood of ambushing the meeting by presenting the last-minute proposal to divert money from the town's centennial fireworks fund. Lockwood claimed the timing was urgent as the federal government's deadline for matching donations was the next day at midnight.

The Red Cross has already deposited the cheque, but has indicated it will return the money.

SICHUAN, China – 
The &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; has commuted the &lt;a href="w%3Acapital%20punishment"&gt;death sentence&lt;/a&gt; of a prominent Tibetan monk, Tenzin Delek Rinpoche, ordering him instead to spend the rest of his life in prison.

In 2002, a Chinese court found Tenzin Delek Rinpoche guilty of involvement in a series of terrorist bombings earlier that year in a region of Sichuan province historically part of &lt;a href="w%3ATibet"&gt;Tibet&lt;/a&gt;, and of inciting separatist activities. He was sentenced to death, but the sentence was then postponed for two years. 

Upon the expiration of his suspended sentence late last year, Chinese officials suggested they might go ahead with the execution. It was to have taken place last month.

But Higher People's Court of Sichuan decided to commute the sentence, saying the monk had obeyed certain conditions that were not disclosed. Officials say he confessed to the bombing, a claim human rights advocates say they do not believe. 

Tenzin Deleg, who is widely respected among Tibetan Buddhists, has said he was wrongly accused. 

Anne Callahan, manager of the &lt;a href="w%3AFree%20Tibet%20campaign"&gt;Free Tibet campaign&lt;/a&gt; in Britain, says Communist officials targeted the spiritual leader because they viewed his vast following as a threat to their authority among the large community of ethnic Tibetans in Sichuan province. 

She says her group believes the real reason for the reprieve of the death sentence was the international pressure brought on Beijing by governments and private organizations. 

"The reality is that his case generated a whole international campaign on his behalf and has actually highlighted the degree of religious repression in Sichuan now," she said. 

The reprieve came exactly two years after the execution of another man, Lobsang Dhondup, who was tried and convicted along with Tenzin Delek for the 2002 bombings. 

The &lt;a href="w%3ATenzin%20Gyatso%2C%2014th%20Dalai%20Lama"&gt;Dalai Lama&lt;/a&gt; and his Tibetan government in exile, along with several human rights groups, had called for the sentence to be reversed.

The United States expressed serious concern about the monk's closed-door trial, saying Chinese authorities failed to provide clear and convincing evidence of guilt. The issue came up during visits to Beijing by Secretary of State Powell and other high-ranking Bush Administration officials. 

Officials at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing had no immediate comment following the news of the court's decision. 

Meanwhile, Tashi Phuntsog, described as Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche's "right-hand man," walks free. He was released earlier this month after being detained since 2002, 10 days after Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche.

The government never said why Tashi Phuntsog was jailed or why he was released early. 

Human Rights Watch, calling on the Communist government to explain Tashi Phuntsog's detention believes he was released needing medical attention. "Tashi Phuntsog entered prison as a healthy man in his early 40s, and he was cast out literally as a broken man," it said.

&lt;a href="w%3AXinhua"&gt;Xinhua&lt;/a&gt; reports he has been "well and fairly treated."

&lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles"&gt;LOS ANGELES&lt;/a&gt; – Eleven charges of murder have been brought against the driver who caused the Glendale train crash, in which 11 people died. 

Juan Manuel Alvarez, 25, could well face the death penalty for his actions. It appears he parked his Jeep Cherokee on the railway line with the intention of committing suicide, but then changed his mind and left the vehicle. Three trains carrying approximately 350 people were involved in the crash, injuring up to 200 passengers.

His arraignment was delayed from Thursday to Friday due to his medical condition. He was charged with 11 counts of murder and was held without bail in a hospital's jail ward after apparently slitting his own wrists and stabbing himself in the chest. Prosecutors have filed 10 counts of murder with so-called special circumstances, and will add the 11th victim to the complaint shortly. Under California law, this makes Alvarez eligible for the death penalty.

The accident was caused as a result of a chain-reaction derailment of three &lt;a href="w%3AUnion%20Pacific%20Railroad"&gt;Union Pacific&lt;/a&gt; trains. Investigators are continuing to try to determine the exact sequence of events.

The row between the &lt;a href="w%3AIrish%20Government"&gt;Irish Government&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASinn%20F%C3%A9in"&gt;Sinn Féin&lt;/a&gt; intensified today with &lt;a href="w%3AGerry%20Adams"&gt;Gerry Adams&lt;/a&gt; accusing the &lt;a href="w%3ATaoiseach"&gt;Taoiseach&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABertie%20Ahern"&gt;Bertie Ahern&lt;/a&gt; of attacking Sinn Féin in order to divert attention from the jailing of disgraced former Minister for Justice &lt;a href="w%3ARay%20Burke"&gt;Ray Burke&lt;/a&gt;.

Burke, who is a former &lt;a href="w%3AFianna%20F%C3%A1il"&gt;Fianna Fáil&lt;/a&gt; minister, began a six-month prison sentence earlier this week for tax offences.

Speaking in &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; on the eve of his meeting with British Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt;, the Sinn Féin President said Bertie Ahern had 'cleverly defused the Ray Burke affair by opening up a full frontal attack on Sinn Féin'.

Mr Adams said that attack was driven by political considerations because the Government had decided that little progress could be made in the &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Ireland"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt; peace process in the next few months. 

Referring to yesterday's heated exchanges in &lt;a href="w%3AD%C3%A1il%20%C3%89ireann"&gt;Dáil Éireann&lt;/a&gt; between Mr Ahern and Sinn Féin TD &lt;a href="w%3ACaoimhgh%C3%ADn%20%C3%93%20Caol%C3%A1in"&gt;Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin&lt;/a&gt;, Mr Adams said, 'We want to do business with the Taoiseach, but he can't expect to attack us in the way that he does and for us not to robustly defend ourselves.

The Sixth Report of the Harold Shipman Inquiry, released today, concludes that British family doctor, &lt;a href="w%3AHarold%20Shipman"&gt;Shipman&lt;/a&gt;, killed about 250 during his career. Shipman was arrested for the murder of Kathleen Grundy in 1998, and concerns arose around this time about the excess number of deaths among his patients.

Shipman was found guilty in 2000 of 15 counts of murder and one of forgery of a will, and jailed for life. The on-going Inquiry, chaired by Dame Janet Smith DBE, began soon after to investigate his past, as well as other suspicious deaths linked to the doctor.

According to the Sixth Report of the Inquiry, it is now thought that he may have begun killing at the very start of his career, possibly through recklessly prescribing drugs, in 1971. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.the-shipman-inquiry.org.uk/6r_page.asp%3Fid%3D3015"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; It is thought he later developed a deliberate intention to kill, mainly targeting the elderly. His first murder may have been as early as in March 1971, and the Inquiry concluded he continued to kill until 1998, the year of his arrest.

Shipman was found dead, hung with his bedsheets in Wakefield Prison on 13 January last year, raising questions about what measures could have prevented this apparent suicide and another investigation, this time by Prisons and Probation Ombudsman Stephen Shaw.

African Union monitors in the Darfur region of Sudan have witnessed an air attack that has killed around 100 people.

The Sudanese government carried out the attack on a village in the northern part of Darfur. It represents a major violation of the ceasefire signed last April between the government and the rebels.

The rebels began their war with the government in 2003, accusing the government of neglecting their region and of oppressing black Africans in favour of Arab Africans.

The New York radio station HOT 97 has apologized after one of its DJs played a song making light of the recent tsunami catastrophe in Asia.

The 'Tsunami Song' was played by 'Miss Jones' on the hip hop and R&amp;B station's Morning show earlier this month. Miss Jones and station management later apologised on-air.

Miss Jones and the Morning team have now been suspended indefinitely.

The Palestinian Authority banned citizens from carrying weapons this Thursday in a step to reduce violence while negotiations with Israel continue on a proposed ceasefire. In addition, they will appoint a new security minister known for his tough stance against militants &amp;mdash; preconditions for peace talks with Israel.

If enforced, this ban will be a strong move against guerilla groups, which actively display their weapons in the Gaza Strip and West Bank due to the lack of control by the Palestinian security forces.

Furthermore, the Palestinian security forces are planning to move in to the southern Gaza Strip to rein in attacks against Israel, to supplement their forces currently deployed in the north.

Mahmoud Abbas' actions are winning praise from Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, who said Thursday that conditions are right for a breakthrough toward peace. He said that he is "very satisfied" with his actions, which aim to curb four years of attacks against Israel.

&lt;a href="w%3ATed%20Turner"&gt;Ted Turner&lt;/a&gt;, the founder of &lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;, last Tuesday accused &lt;a href="w%3AFox%20Broadcasting%20Company"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt; of being a &lt;a href="w%3Apropaganda%20model"&gt;propaganda&lt;/a&gt; mouthpiece for the Bush administration. He likened the network's current popularity to Adolf Hitler's rise to power in pre-war Germany, and criticised the "dumbing down" of news which left the public uninformed of crucial issues.

Turner said, "Adolf Hitler was more popular in Germany in the early 1930s than people that were running against him."

Fox News in turn accused CNN of simple sour grapes.

In a statement, the channel claimed that Ted was "understandably bitter having lost his ratings, his network and now his mind - we wish him well."

Turner resigned from his post as Vice President of AOL Time Warner in January 2003. He remains one of America's largest private landowners, possessing approximately two million acres of land.

Fox News remains the highest rating 24-hour news channel on US cable - but has been highly criticised for its perceived right-wing bias.

Recent House Committee on Government Reform figures by the US Democrats show that the US Administration spent over $US88 million on public relations contracts in 2004, of which 41 per cent were awarded on a non-competitive basis.

BEIJING, China – &lt;a href="w%3ACommunist%20Party%20of%20China"&gt;Chinese Communist&lt;/a&gt; leaders and the family of the late purged party chief, &lt;a href="w%3AZhao%20Ziyang"&gt;Zhao Ziyang&lt;/a&gt;, have agreed to bury him on Saturday, nearly two weeks after his death. The burial has been delayed over disagreements between Mr. Zhao's family and the government over the funeral arrangements. 

For many in &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; and overseas, the former premier of &lt;a href="w%3ACommunist%20Party"&gt;Communist Party&lt;/a&gt; general secretary symbolized the drive for a reassessment of the government's &lt;a href="w%3ATiananmen%20Square%20protests%20of%201989"&gt;1989 crackdown&lt;/a&gt; on pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square. 

In the two weeks since his death, police have been posted outside the &lt;a href="w%3ABeijing"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt; home where Mr. Zhao spent his last 15 years under house arrest and where hundreds have been assembling to pay tribute. Agents have been turning many of the mourners away.

The leadership wants the ceremony on Saturday to take place out of the public eye and officials announced Thursday that foreign journalists would not be allowed to cover it. However, Mr. Zhao's family has asked for appropriate honors in keeping with his status as a former party chief. 

Instead of being given the customary state funeral to reflect his former positions, he will be given a more low-key ceremony.

Disagreement between the family and the government about what should be said at the funeral was part of the delay. Zhao's family disagrees with the government over the correctness of Zhao's actions regarding Tiananmen Square. 

State-controlled newspapers and broadcasts have been devoid of news on Zhao's death and on what his eulogy will say. 

Cheng Li, a professor of government at Hamilton College in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, says the Communist leaders have been trying to ensure that Mr. Zhao's funeral and eulogy do not ignite what might be an explosive new debate.

"They don't want to see it widely publicized," he said. "Certainly, they don't want to repeat what happened 16 years ago because of the emotions and other things could lead to a very sustained, prolonged event." 

Analysts say the government sees a parallel with the death of another reformer, party leader &lt;a href="w%3AHu%20Yaobang"&gt;Hu Yaobang&lt;/a&gt;, which sparked the demonstrations in May and June of 1989.

Mr. Zhao, then the Communist party chief, went to the square two weeks before the crackdown and tearfully urged the students to abandon their protest. 

Shortly after, the leadership accused him of sympathizing with the demonstrators and trying to split the party. He was ousted as party chief and placed under house arrest until his death on January 17th at the age of 85. 

While many young people in China today do not remember Mr. Zhao as an advocate of reform, emotions remain high among those who do recall his role. Witnesses on Thursday said guards beat a number of people - some of them elderly - who have been trying to pay tribute to the late leader outside government offices in Beijing over the past few days.

&lt;a href="w%3AKrakow"&gt;Krakow&lt;/a&gt; – 

About twenty eight &lt;a href="w%3Ahuman%20rights"&gt;human rights&lt;/a&gt; activists who had been imprisoned on Wednesday, January 26, 2005 have now mostly been freed from police custody following rapid international solidarity appeals. The activists had been imprisoned in relation to their protest in the main square of &lt;a href="w%3AKrakow"&gt;Krakow&lt;/a&gt;, Poland, against the presence of &lt;a href="w%3AVladimir%20Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; at the ceremonies for the 60th anniversary of the freeing of the &lt;a href="w%3AAuschwitz-Birkenau"&gt;Auschwitz-Birkenau&lt;/a&gt; concentration camp. 

At least two people were officially charged, under Article 136 of Polish &lt;a href="w%3Acriminal%20law"&gt;criminal law&lt;/a&gt;, with the offence of insulting a &lt;a href="w%3Ahead%20of%20state"&gt;head of state&lt;/a&gt;, namely, &lt;a href="w%3AVladimir%20Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt;, but it remains unclear how many people in total have been charged with this offence.

&lt;a href="w%3AVladimir%20Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt;, who is suspected to be responsible for &lt;a href="w%3Awar%20crime"&gt;war crimes&lt;/a&gt; and possibly &lt;a href="w%3Acrime%20against%20humanity"&gt;crimes against humanity&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AChechnya"&gt;Chechnya&lt;/a&gt;, was neither detained nor arrested during his visit to Poland.

BEIJING, China – 
The &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; intensified security to prevent mourners attending funeral in &lt;a href="w%3ABeijing"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="w%3AZhao%20Ziyang"&gt;Zhao Ziyang&lt;/a&gt;. Mr. Zhao was the former &lt;a href="w%3ACommunist%20Party"&gt;Communist Party&lt;/a&gt; secretary general who was purged for opposing the 1989 military crackdown on the &lt;a href="w%3ATiananmen"&gt;Tiananmen Square student movement&lt;/a&gt;. He died two weeks ago at age 85, having spent the last fifteen years of his life under house arrest. 
According to a story released by the &lt;a href="w%3AAgence%20France-Presse"&gt;Agence France-Presse&lt;/a&gt; anonymous witnesses said the government detained several people in Beijing. They claim some of these people were severely beaten.
A man who preferred to be anonymous said: "A man from Henan province was beaten badly. His left eyeball looked like it was beaten out of its socket and he had a one inch cut to his right eye. An elderly woman from Shandong province was beaten to a point where she couldn't move and a man from Hunan province was also beaten."

According to the witness the police argued Zhao was a political criminal. They said:"Why are you commemorating him? You're clearly opposing the government."

The government of China has already received criticism for what some feel to be intimidation of activists and other anti-democratic acts like censorship &lt;a href="http%3A//news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3548035.stm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,

&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; – 
&lt;a href="US"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; manufacturing giant &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AProctor%20%26amp%3B%20Gamble"&gt;Proctor &amp; Gamble&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (P&amp;G) plans to acquire &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGillette%20Co."&gt;Gillette Co.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for &lt;a href="US%24"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;57 billion in stock. The purchase plan calls for P&amp;G to swap 0.975 shares of its stock per share of Gillete Co. P&amp;G also announced a stock buyback program in which they would purchase up to US$22 billion of shares over the next 18 months. Including the stock buyback program, the merger is being financed by 60 percent stock and 40 percent cash.

P&amp;G is known for brands such as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAriel%20%28detergent%29"&gt;Ariel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATide%20%28brand%29"&gt;Tide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; washing powder, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMax%20Factor"&gt;Max Factor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; cosmetics, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APringles"&gt;Pringles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; potato crisps (chips) and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHugo%20Boss"&gt;Hugo Boss&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;a href="Lacoste"&gt;Lacoste&lt;/a&gt; perfumes.

Gillette, known for brands such as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGillette"&gt;Gillette&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; razors, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOral%20B"&gt;Oral B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; dental care, and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADuracell"&gt;Duracell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; batteries, has had growing problems with the growth of private labels and price cuts demanded by large supermarkets.

After the acquisition is completed, Gillette's CEO &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJames%20M.%20Kilts"&gt;James Kilts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; will be P&amp;G's vice-chairman. Kilts said that he expects that this acquisition will cause additional mergers to take place.

"I believe the consumer product industry needs to consolidate," said Kilts, "we believe we can bring these companies together and create a juggernaut."

P&amp;G and Gillette have a combined market capitalization of about $185 billion US, which will make it the largest in the sector.

<h3>Layoffs</h3>
The early morning announcement states that 6,000 employees will be eliminated. Most of the layoffs will result from reducing overlapping management positions and other supporting positions within the combined company.

Antitrust regulators in the US and &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; plan to review the acquisition, to determine whether the combined company will have too much power over pricing and shelf space.

P&amp;G plans to provide additional details about the merger Friday morning (East Coast time) in &lt;a href="New%20York%20City"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;.

Bucharest, Romania – Communications corporation Telekom Austria has stated that it intends to expand in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASoutheastern%20Europe"&gt;southeastern Europe&lt;/a&gt; and is specifically targeting the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARomania"&gt;Romanian&lt;/a&gt; mobile phone giant Mobifon, which operates under the brand name &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AConnex%20Romania"&gt;Connex&lt;/a&gt;. Mobifon's Connex &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AGSM"&gt;GSM&lt;/a&gt; network is the second-largest in Romania, with more than 4.9 million subscribers. Mobifon is also one of the largest and best-known Romanian companies, as well as one of the largest &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AInternet%20Service%20Providers"&gt;ISPs&lt;/a&gt; in the region.

Several sources have stated that &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AVodafone"&gt;Vodafone&lt;/a&gt;, which has an important share in Mobifon, could sell its shares to Telekom Austria to take-over the Romanian operator for approximately 3 billion &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aeuro"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt;.

This is not the first attempt by Telekom Austria in its drive towards expansion in the region. At the end of 2004, it signed an agreement to buy Mobiltel from the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABulgaria"&gt;Bulgarian&lt;/a&gt; government for 1.6 billion euro. Telekom Austria also intends to expand into &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASerbia"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABosnia"&gt;Bosnia&lt;/a&gt; in 2005, followed by &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AMacedonia"&gt;Macedonia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AMontenegro"&gt;Montenegro&lt;/a&gt;.

Mobifon, the Romanian operator, is currently a branch of Telesystems International Wireless (TIW), a Canadian communications company which also owns the Oskar brand in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ACzechia"&gt;Czechia&lt;/a&gt;. The main shareholders in TIW are &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ANetherlands"&gt;Netherlandic&lt;/a&gt; operator Mobifon Holdings BV, with 63.45% share, as well as Vodafone Europe BV (20.15% participation) and Deraso Holding BV (14.4% participation).

With 4.9 million customers, Mobifon has significant market share of Romania's 10.2 million mobile phone subscribers. It also plans to be the first operator to establish a &lt;a href="%3Aw%3A3G"&gt;3G&lt;/a&gt; network across the country.

<h1>Honduras' Head of Congress illegally standing for President</h1>
Head of Congress is illegally standing in the February 20th internal party elections for President of &lt;a href="w%3AHonduras"&gt;Honduras&lt;/a&gt;, according to a group of 20 well known from the capital . This is because in the run up to the previous elections it was decided by the 5 presidential candidates, including fellow National Party member and current President , to support a ban on members of the National Congress from standing for President. This was in order to discourage people from using the Congress as a launch pad for their presidential aspirations. A constitutional reform to this effect was then passed by the Congress while it was headed by Mr Lobo. This law appears to have been conveniently forgotten until yesterday when these lawyers made a public announcement calling on both The Supreme Electoral Tribune and the Public Ministry to determine the illegality of Pepe Lobo's candidacy, and to act in the case of his not being allowed to stand.

&lt;a href="w%3AManchester"&gt;MANCHESTER&lt;/a&gt;, England – Retired schoolteacher Gordon Park, 61, was today convicted of murdering his wife in July 1976, after a ten week long trial known as the "Lady in the Lake" case.

Mother of three Carol Park disappeared from her home near &lt;a href="w%3ABarrow-in-Furness"&gt;Barrow, Cumbria,&lt;/a&gt; in July 1976 when she was 30 years old. She had had a tempestuous relationship with her husband, and had previously twice left him to live with a lover. Park reported that she was missing from their home when he returned with his children from a day trip to the seaside resort of &lt;a href="w%3ABlackpool"&gt;Blackpool&lt;/a&gt;. Because of her earlier disappearances, he did not report her missing to the police for six weeks, shortly before she would have been expected to start a new school year as a teacher.

A jury at Manchester Crown Court however heard evidence that the keen climber and sailor had bludgeoned her to death with an ice axe, tied her body up in a foetal position, and wrapped it in plastic and a weighted carpet and dumped the body in &lt;a href="w%3AConiston%20Water"&gt;Coniston Water&lt;/a&gt;, the third largest lake in England. The body was discovered by an amateur diving team in 1997. The jury heard that if the body had been dumped only a few feet further from the shore, it is likely that it would have sunk to the deepest part of the lake beyond the reach of divers, and would never have been found.

Park was arrested and charged with the murder in 1997, but his trial then collapsed through lack of evidence. Further evidence came to light, including geological evidence that the rocks which were used to weigh down the body were of a rare type which happened to be found in the rockery of the Parks' house, and the meticulous knots used to tie up the body were described as "unusual", of the type used by climbers or sailors, and Park was re-arrested in 2004.

The prosecution admitted that most of the evidence against Park was circumstantial, and there were some exclamations of surprise in the public gallery when the jury returned its verdict. In a plea of mitigation, defending lawyer Mr Andrew Edis QC said that Park, who had subsequently remarried twice, had lead an otherwise blameless life. Trial judge Mr Justice McCombe said that he was not sure if there was a significant degree of planning in the murder, but he did take into account the degree of violence employed in the killing, and the degree of suffering endured by many people, not least the Park children, because of the concealment of the crime for so long, in passing a sentence of life imprisonment with a recommendation that Park not be considered for parole for 15 years.

&lt;a href="w%3AHamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt;, a radical &lt;a href="w%3Aislamist"&gt;islamist&lt;/a&gt; party, has won by a large majority in the &lt;a href="w%3AGaza%20Strip"&gt;Gaza Strip&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Acouncil"&gt;council&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aelections"&gt;elections&lt;/a&gt; held last month. Hamas won 75 out of the 118 seats, with &lt;a href="w%3AFatah"&gt;Fatah&lt;/a&gt;, the party of &lt;a href="w%3APalestine"&gt;Palestinian&lt;/a&gt; leader, &lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud%20Abbas"&gt;Mahmoud Abbas&lt;/a&gt; only managing to secure 39 seats. Of the ten council areas in Gaza, Hamas has control of seven.

Fathiya Barghouti Rheime, a 30-year-old high school teacher, and mother of two, was one of the seven Hamas mayors elected in the Gaza strip. She has become the second female mayor of a Palestinian community, and the first ever elected one. "It's a sign of change," she said "I'm deeply concerned about transmitting the picture of the active Islamic woman to the world, to wipe away the blemish of the veil."

In the &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Bank"&gt;West Bank&lt;/a&gt;, Female candidates won 52 of 306 seats. Two and a half times the number of seats that had been reserved for women.

With just days to go before Sunday's historic poll to choose a new government in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; Secretary General &lt;a href="w%3AKofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt; has invited the people of Iraq to exercise their democratic rights.

The poll, the first free elections in a generation, faces disruption from insurgents who are totally opposed to democracy. Annan warned them not to interfere and promised continuing help from the UN for the country in the future.

Annan made his appeal in a pre-recorded message, broadcast on TV inside Iraq. "Elections are the best way to determine any country's future; please exercise your democratic rights on Sunday," he said. "Whatever your feelings about how the country reached this point, this election offers an opportunity to move away from violence and uncertainty toward peace and representative government."

The UN has been providing advice and technical help to the Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq (IECI), as well as $100m funding for the poll and co-ordination of international assistance. A team of 40 experts has overseen the delivery of three million tonnes of election materials and helped the IECI and Iraqi officials prepare and maintain the voters register.

BEIJING/TAIPEI &amp;mdash; Nonstop flights between &lt;a href="China"&gt;mainland China&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; took off Saturday for the first time in more than half a century.

Traditional dragon dancers in bright costumes performed on the tarmac as three airplanes prepared to leave Beijing's airport Saturday, the first to fly nonstop to Taiwan since 1949. The ceremony marked the first of 48 charter flights allowed to operate between Taiwan and the mainland over the three-week &lt;a href="w%3AChinese%20New%20Year"&gt;Chinese New Year&lt;/a&gt; holiday season. 

Later, a &lt;a href="w%3AChina%20Southern%20Airlines"&gt;China Southern Airlines&lt;/a&gt; plane, which took off from the &lt;a href="Guangzhou"&gt;Guangzhou&lt;/a&gt;, landed at Taipei's &lt;a href="w%3AChiang%20Kai-shek%20International%20Airport"&gt;Chiang Kai-shek International Airport&lt;/a&gt; amid similar fanfare. This marked the first successful direct flight across the two sides, still technically at war.

The &lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20of%20China"&gt;Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; government banned direct flights after the &lt;a href="w%3AKuomintang"&gt;Kuomintang&lt;/a&gt; defeat in the &lt;a href="w%3AChinese%20Civil%20War"&gt;Chinese Civil War&lt;/a&gt; to the Communists caused the government to retreat to Taiwan. Although there is consensus on all sides to resume the &lt;a href="w%3Athree%20links"&gt;three links&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; direct postal, telephone, and airline links &amp;mdash; between mainland China and Taiwan, Taiwan's President &lt;a href="w%3AChen%20Shui-bian"&gt;Chen Shui-bian&lt;/a&gt; has been reluctant to move ahead, citing the possibility that the &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; could disguise troop carriers as commercial airliners to invade Taiwan.

All normal airline flights between the two sides have to be routed through a third party &amp;mdash; usually Hong Kong &amp;mdash; making a three hour flight between Taipei and Shanghai last eight hours. 

Taiwanese and mainland airlines are forbidden to travel into their respective airspaces, forcing passengers to change airlines too. These restrictions were first lifted for Chinese New Years in 2003, but those flights still stopped briefly in Hong Kong. 

Taiwanese legislator &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Chang"&gt;John Chang&lt;/a&gt;, the grandson of former President &lt;a href="w%3AChiang%20Kai-shek"&gt;Chiang Kai-shek&lt;/a&gt;, spoke of the flights' significance at the ceremony. 

Mr. Chang said that despite differences, the flights symbolize "the hopes of the two sides for peace, stability, dialogue and mutual development."

Mr. Chang had been part of the group of &lt;a href="w%3APan-Blue%20Coalition"&gt;opposition&lt;/a&gt; lawmakers that helped arrange the flights.
This year's flights were planned after diplomatic negotiations in Macau, ending on January 15. They are aimed to allow the easy reuniting of families which are split between the island and the mainland for the celebrations.

The ROC government hopes the flights can form the basis for further negotiations and better relations with the People's Republic of China. However, the PRC, which is refusing to deal with the &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan%20independence"&gt;independence&lt;/a&gt;-leaning government of President Chen, is less optimistic.

Most of the passengers taking advantage of the nonstop flights, running until February 20, are Taiwanese businesspeople who work on the mainland. 

Many Taiwanese have lobbied their government to ease its ban on direct air links, especially as trade continues to grow between the island and the mainland, despite the political tensions. Mainland Chinese officials this month said cross-strait trade had reached a record $70 billion in 2004.

The present aircraft, &lt;a href="w%3ASikorsky"&gt;Sikorsky&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AH-3%20Sea%20King"&gt;SeaKings&lt;/a&gt;, are around thirty years old and do not have the payload capacity to carry the modern communications gear demanded by the &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;. The contract is expected to cover the purchase of 23 helicopters.

When invitations were made to industry inviting proposals for replacements, Sikorsky offered their H-92. Lockheed Martin did not have a suitable helicopter and, rather than developing, a new design, offered the European EH101, renamed the US101. The US101 will be built in America using mainly US components with some European content.

The EH101 was developed jointly by the British company Westland and the Italian Augusta, who formed the AugustaWestland company. The helicopter has seen service with the British Army in Bosnia, the Royal Navy in the recent Iraq war and with Canadian Coastguard in search and rescue operations.

Fourteen countries outside of Iraq have been selected for the installation of &lt;a href="w%3Apolling%20stations"&gt;polling stations&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href="w%3AIraqi%20National%20Assembly%20election%2C%202005"&gt;Iraqi National Assembly election&lt;/a&gt;. Among these, &lt;a href="w%3AParis"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, capital city of &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, will welcome voters from France, &lt;a href="w%3ABelgium"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ASwitzerland"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;.

While the event has not been kept secret, the French government and media have been quite discreet about it. The polling station has been installed in an unused elementary school in a calm residential neighbourhood of the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AXIIIe%20arrondissement"&gt;XIIIe arrondissement&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, without fanfare. Most inhabitants are not even aware of its presence &amp;ndash; that is, until they notice the unusual deployment of police and come across the posters written in French and Arabic. Despite the discretion, the sight of police guarding a polling station is striking in a country where elections are a calm affair on a Sunday, and polling stations, most of which are installed in schools, are only noticeable because of the official billboards carrying the candidates' posters.

Security measures have been taken &amp;ndash; metallic barriers prevent parking in and around the front and back entrances to the station, and &lt;a href="w%3ACompagnies%20R%C3%A9publicaines%20de%20S%C3%A9curit%C3%A9"&gt;CRS&lt;/a&gt; riot police with &lt;a href="w%3Abulletproof%20vest"&gt;bulletproof vest&lt;/a&gt;s guard the entrances.
Still, overall, the security measures remain limited. Traffic flows in the street, passers-by freely walk in front of the station entrance, no display of heavy weapons. This contrasts with the use of military troops and deployments of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AFrench%20Gendarmerie"&gt;gendarmes mobiles&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that France used in its &lt;a href="w%3AVigipirate"&gt;Vigipirate&lt;/a&gt; anti-terror plan following the &lt;a href="w%3A1995%20Islamist%20terror%20bombings%20in%20France"&gt;Islamist terror bombings&lt;/a&gt; that it suffered in 1995, or the typical security measures kept around possible terror targets such as the &lt;a href="w%3Aembassy"&gt;embassies&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20of%20America"&gt;United States of America&lt;/a&gt;. This time, military cars and a handful of soldiers were seen in the morning, but were gone in the afternoon.

The BBC reported on January 27 that statistics released by the Iraqi Ministry of Health showed that Coalition forces killed 60% of the civilians that died in the period July 2004 to January 2005. 

The figures, normally available only to the Iraqi cabinet, show a total of 3,274 Iraqi civilians were killed and 12,657 wounded during the continuing conflict. These figures exclude the deaths of known insurgents.

However according to the Iraqi Ministry of Health, the BBC misunderstood the matter. According to the previous story from BBC these figures were a result of Coalition and Iraqi Security Forces military operations.

However, the Iraqi Ministry of Health explained that the published figures also include Iraqis killed by terrorists, not only those killed by Coalition forces or Iraqi security forces; and that those recorded as killed in military action included terrorists themselves, and Iraqi security forces.

The BBC recognized their error and apologized in a recent news item&lt;a href="http%3A//news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/panorama/4217413.stm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and retracted the conclusions drawn by their original report:

&lt;blockquote&gt;♡❤"The BBC regrets mistakes in its published and broadcast reports yesterday," reported the BBC."♡❤&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The figures, based on records from Iraqi public hospitals released by the Iraqi Ministry of Health, are shown in the following table:

Shortly before the release of the figures by the BBC, &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Negroponte"&gt;US Ambassador John Negroponte&lt;/a&gt; had told BBC reporter John Simpson:

"My impression is that the largest amount of civilian casualties definitely is a result of these indiscriminate car bombings."

Officials from the People's Republic of China have agreed to purchase 60 Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft in a deal worth US$7.2bn.

In China, airliners are selected and purchased by the government, which then distributes them to different airlines. The preliminary agreement will see Dreamliners delivered to six airlines - Air China, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines, Hainan Airlines, Shanghai Airlines and Xiamen Airlines. The deliveries are scheduled to be in time for the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games.

The aircraft was once named the 7E7 but was renamed at the same time the deal was announced. Boeing will begin production in 2006 and the aircraft should enter airline service in 2008. It will seat 200 to 300 people and will have a range of 3,500 to 8,500 nautical miles. Through the use of the latest materials and designs it will be 20% more fuel efficient than the equivalent aircraft today.

Ex-British Culture Minister has lived with the HIV virus for 17 years, he has revealed to the Sunday Times.

The former cabinet minister decided to go public after the former South African President Nelson Mandela announced his son Makgatho Mandela, had died of AIDS.

'When I first heard about it, I was really worried because there was hardly any treatment,' he told the newspaper.

Mr Smith was quickly put on a course of anti-retrovirals after he was diagonosed. He said that he had "been with the all the time".

Chris Smith revealed he was gay in 1984. He was sacked from his post (which he held since 1997) in 2001, after controversies over the National Lottery and the construction of the new Wembley Stadium.

He is due to stand down at the next General Election.

&lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;IRAQ&lt;/a&gt; – The first free &lt;a href="w%3Aelection"&gt;election&lt;/a&gt;s in over 50 years have begun in Iraq, via proportional representation, to choose members for a 275-strong assembly that will then draw up a constitution.

Interim President &lt;a href="w%3AGhazi%20Al-Yawar"&gt;Ghazi Al-Yawar&lt;/a&gt; was among the first to cast a ballot.

However violence has already begun to overshadow the event, both inside Iraq and abroad, with a suicide bomber blowing himself up close to a polling place in western &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;, and a riot and bomb scare in Sydney, Australia.

According to police reports four people were killed and at least nine injured in the Baghdad bombing. A total of at least 36 people have so far been killed in Iraq today in various suicide bombing since the opening of the polls.

As well as suicide bombings, insurgents have used mortars to attack the people. In southern Baghdad they killed at least two people, and in &lt;a href="w%3AHilla"&gt;Hilla&lt;/a&gt; one person was killed. Mortar rounds have also been fired on other cities, including Mosul and Baquba.

28,000 polling booths in 5,578 stations opened at 7 am (local time), closely guarded by both coalition troops and Iraqi security forces. Turn out has so far been described as "sporadic", with queues in Shia areas but few people voting in Sunni areas.

"Thank God, thank God." said the Interim President, "Blessed are the Iraqi elections. We greet all Iraqi people and urge them not to give up their rights, to vote for Iraq, elect Iraq and not to give up on Iraq"

"Deep in my heart, I feel that Iraqis deserve free elections," he went on, "This will be our first step towards joining the free world and being a democracy that Iraqis will be proud of."

<h2>Voting abroad</h2>

Booths have also been set up in many countries outside Iraq to allow expatriates a chance to vote in the elections, however Iraqis in countries without booths are complaining about not being able to use postal votes, and those in countries which do have booths complain that there are not enough of them.

Iraqis in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; would have to travel to Australia to lodge their vote. "There is a lot of interest in this election. Not all the Iraqis here have passports yet, so not so many can travel. I'm a little sad that we can't contribute to this," said Wellington's Iraqi Association spokesman Jafar Abdulghani yesterday. "Our association would have been very interested to invite the organisers to help us with voting." There are currently around 7000 Iraqis in New Zealand who are eligible to vote.

Fifty people rioted in Sydney, Australia, when about 20 protesters yelled insults at voters leaving the center, setting off the melee. Voting organizers said the protesters were &lt;a href="w%3AWahhabism"&gt;Wahhabis&lt;/a&gt;, members of a sect of Sunni Islam associated with militants in Iraq. Police said there no were arrests and no reports of injuries. After the fighting was contained, an unattended backpack found near the center led police to close the center and cordon off the area.

It turned out not to be a bomb, but polling was extended. Thair Wali, an Iraqi adviser for the International Organization for Migration, said the fight broke out after the protesters began using cameras and cell phones to take pictures of voters leaving the station. "This is scary for the people, taking photos of the voting," he said.

Iraqi nationals abroad have said they failed to register to vote, fearing terrorists would then target relatives in Iraq.

<doc id="3857" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=3857" title="French goat is found to have BSE">
<h1>French goat is found to have BSE</h1>
The &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; has announced that a &lt;a href="w%3Afrance"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; goat has become the first animal other than a cow to ever have tested positive for &lt;a href="w%3Abovine%20spongiform%20encephalopathy"&gt;bovine spongiform encephalopathy&lt;/a&gt; (BSE). The results were announced after over two years testing of the goat's remains. Scientists originally thought that the goat was suffering from &lt;a href="w%3Ascrapie"&gt;scrapie&lt;/a&gt;, another degenerative disease that can be found in goats and sheep.

This discovery proves correct the theory that BSE, or mad cow disease as it is commonly know, can exist in &lt;a href="w%3Aruminants"&gt;ruminants&lt;/a&gt; other than cattle.

The EU has stated that eating goat products is still safe due to precautionary measures which have been put in place. "I want to reassure consumers that existing safety measures in the EU offer a very high level of protection." The EU Commissioner responsible for Health and Consumer Protection, Markos Kyprianou said regarding the findings.

"This case was discovered thanks to the EU testing system in place in France."

"The testing programme has shown us that there is a very low incidence rate of TSEs (transmissible spongiform encephalopathies) in goats and allowed us to detect suspect animals so that they can be taken out of the food chain, as was done with this goat and its entire herd." 

The EU intends to test 200,000 goats in the 25 member states over the next six months.

AUSTRALIA – &lt;a href="w%3AMamdouh%20Habib"&gt;Mamdouh Habib&lt;/a&gt;, a former &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanmo%20Bay"&gt;Guantanmo Bay&lt;/a&gt; detainee, arrived back in &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; and was reunited with his family on Friday, after having been held in the &lt;a href="w%3AUSA"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Navy"&gt;navy&lt;/a&gt; base for three years without charge.

In a statement through his Australian lawyer, Stephen Hopper, the Habib family thanked the Australian people during Mr Habib's incarereation. The statement also offered thanks for the work of Mr Habib's American lawyer saying, "Most of all we'd like to thank Joe Margulies for his excellent efforts ... Joe's the best lawyer in the world."

Mr Margulies says Mr Habib needs medical treatment for chronic physical and mental conditions he suffers from his incarceration.

Mr Habib was detained by Coalition forces in three weeks after the &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011"&gt;September 11&lt;/a&gt; attacks on the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Trade%20Center"&gt;World Trade Center&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Ain%20New%20York"&gt;in New York&lt;/a&gt;, on suspicion of having links to &lt;a href="w%3AOsama%20bin%20Laden"&gt;Osama bin Laden&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Qaeda"&gt;Al Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aterrorist"&gt;terrorist&lt;/a&gt; group.

New York, USA – Students and professors at &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;'s Hamilton College have raised protests over an invitation to the controversial ethics professor, Ward Churchill, to participate in a panel at the college. The main objection is related to comments by Mr. Churchill, chairman of the ethnic studies from the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Colorado"&gt;University of Colorado&lt;/a&gt;, who in a paper written after the &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%2C%202001%20attacks"&gt;September 11, 2001 attacks&lt;/a&gt; on the in New York, compared the victims of the attack to "little &lt;a href="w%3AEichmann"&gt;Eichmann&lt;/a&gt;s".

Churchill's &lt;a href="http%3A//www.kersplebedeb.com/mystuff/s11/churchill.html"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;, entitled "Some People Push Back", charges that all American citizens are complicit in the "genocide of 500,000 Iraqi children," which he maintains occurred during the Gulf War as a direct result of military actions and the destruction of infrastructure and the water supply. Due to their inaction and empowerment of the American government, he compares American citizens to "Good Germans." He also charges that the inhabitants of the targets of attack, namely the &lt;a href="w%3APentagon"&gt;Pentagon&lt;/a&gt; and World Trade Center, have a dubious claim to the title "Innocent Civilians," as the Pentagon was a military target and the WTC was home to many who he alleges profited from the Iraqi Genocide.

Administrators defended Professor Churchill's appearance despite the fact that some considered his views repugnant and disparaging.

According to Hamilton College spokesman Michael DeBraggio: "Hamilton, like any institution committed to the free exchange of ideas, invites to its campus people of diverse opinions, often controversial."

The University of Colorado's Interim Chancellor Phil Distefano said in a statement:"I wish to make it clear that Professor Ward Churchill's views of the events of 9/11 are his own and do not represent the views of University of Colorado faculty, staff, students, administration or Regents. While I may personally find his views offensive, I also must support his right as an American citizen to hold and express his views, no matter how repugnant, as guaranteed by the First Amendment of the Constitution."

The professor's opinions divided New York's Hamilton College, where Churchill is scheduled to speak. Jessica Miraglia, a student at Hamilton, created a poster defending the professor reading "You don't have to agree with them in order to learn from them.". Sophomore Matt Coppo, who lost his father in the World Trade Center attacks was angered over the invitation to Churchill. "Knowing that I'm paying for a person to disrespect my father, it doesn't go over too well in my mind." 

Two congressmen from Colorado asked professor Churchill to apologize for comparing victims of the 9/11 World Trade Center attack to Nazis. Professor Churchill has said that he will not back off his statement.

Switzerland, Israel – &lt;a href="w%3AEphraim%20Kishon"&gt;Ephraim Kishon&lt;/a&gt;, Israeli author, satirist, playwright, screenwriter, and film director, died of a heart attack in his home in &lt;a href="w%3AAppenzell"&gt;Appenzell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASwitzerland"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;, Saturday night. He was interred on February 1, in the Trumpeldor St. cemetery in &lt;a href="w%3ATel%20Aviv"&gt;Tel Aviv&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;. 

He was born on &lt;a href="w%3AAugust%2023"&gt;August 23&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3A1924"&gt;1924&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href="w%3ABudapest"&gt;Budapest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHungary"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt;, as Ferenc Hoffmann. A prisoner in a Hungarian &lt;a href="w%3Aconcentration%20camp"&gt;concentration camp&lt;/a&gt;, he escaped during the journey to the &lt;a href="w%3Aextermination%20camp"&gt;extermination camp&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ASobibor"&gt;Sobibor&lt;/a&gt;.
He returned home to find his family alive and joined them in hiding until the end of the war. 

Changing his name to Ferenc Kishont, he worked as a writer in a pro-communist satirical magazine until fleeing to Israel with his first wife, Eva, in 1949. There, an immigration clerk changed his name to the Hebrew ♡❤♡Ephraim Kishon♡❤♡ (אפרים קישון), which he had used ever since. Recently, he lived in both Switzerland and Israel. 

A worldwide bestselling author, his books and short stories were translated into 37 languages. He also wrote a regular column in &lt;a href="w%3AMaariv"&gt;Maariv&lt;/a&gt;, wrote numerous plays, and created several films, amongst which are ♡❤Sallah♡❤ (♡❤סלאח שבתי♡❤), which won two &lt;a href="w%3AGolden%20Globe"&gt;Golden Globe&lt;/a&gt; awards and was nominated for an &lt;a href="w%3AAcademy%20award"&gt;Academy award&lt;/a&gt;, and ♡❤The Policeman♡❤ (♡❤השוטר אזולאי♡❤), which won one Golden Globe award and was nomniated for an Academy Award.

He won many awards over the years, including the Israeli &lt;a href="w%3ANordau%20Prize"&gt;Nordau Prize&lt;/a&gt; for Literature (1953), the Israeli &lt;a href="w%3ANahum%20Prize"&gt;Sokolov Prize&lt;/a&gt; for Journalism (1958), the Israeli &lt;a href="w%3AKinor%20David%20Prize"&gt;Kinor David Prize&lt;/a&gt; (1964), and the &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael%20Prize"&gt;Israel Prize&lt;/a&gt; for Lifetime Achievement (2002).

Israeli Prime Minister, &lt;a href="w%3AAriel%20Sharon"&gt;Ariel Sharon&lt;/a&gt;, said in a eulogy: "Ephraim Kishon was one of the giants of Israeli culture, who created an entire cultural world for a country in formation; he created an entire world of culture for the country." 

Prior to the funeral, his coffin was placed on the morning of February 1, in the Journalists' House in Tel Aviv, where his friends, colleagues, family, and fans, payed their lasts respects to him. Amongst them was Israeli Minister of Education, &lt;a href="w%3ALimor%20Livnat"&gt;Limor Livnat&lt;/a&gt;, and Mayor of Tel Aviv, &lt;a href="w%3ARon%20Huldai"&gt;Ron Huldai&lt;/a&gt;.

Kishon left behind his third wife, Lisa, and children Raphael, Amir and Renana.

Many of the incidents highlighted by the report resulted in injury, or even death.

The report detailed 13 patients who had operations that they were not meant to have or who had the wrong part of the body operated upon. It also noted that another 22 were seriously injured in falls in wards and bathrooms.

Other statistics included four suicides in hospital, with another 128 occurring in &lt;a href="w%3Acommunity%20care"&gt;community care&lt;/a&gt;. Another nine people retained surgical instruments or materials inside them after the operation. The rest of the serious incidents related to labour and delivery problems (26) and clinical management problems (157).

&lt;a href="w%3ATatra%20Mountains"&gt;Tatra Mountains&lt;/a&gt; – A &lt;a href="w%3ASlovakia"&gt;Slovakian&lt;/a&gt; man who was trapped in his car under an &lt;a href="w%3Aavalanche"&gt;avalanche&lt;/a&gt;, has escaped by urinating on ice to melt it. The man&amp;mdash;who had 60 half-litre bottles of beer with him in the car&amp;mdash;literally drank his way to safety.

"I was scooping the snow from above me and packing it down below the window, and then I peed on it to melt it," he said.

Rescue workers found the man still drunk on a mountain path in Slovakia’s Tatra Mountains four days after his &lt;a href="w%3AAudi"&gt;Audi&lt;/a&gt; car was buried. 

"It was hard and now my kidneys and liver hurt. But I'm glad the beer I took on holiday turned out to be useful and I managed to get out of there," he said. 

He first planned to shovel the ice from outside his window, directly into his car, but soon realised that he would run out of room in his car before he would be able to reach the top.

Snowfalls of levels not seen since 1941 have fallen over parts of Europe over the past week. Some places have registered more than 3 meters of snow in 24 hours.

&lt;a href="w%3AInverell"&gt;Inverell, Australia&lt;/a&gt; – Police are investigating damage to a memorial to the 28 victims of the &lt;a href="w%3AMyall%20Creek%20Massacre"&gt;Myall Creek massacre&lt;/a&gt;. The Plaques which are in the town of &lt;a href="w%3AInverell"&gt;Inverell&lt;/a&gt; in northern &lt;a href="w%3ANSW"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; had the words "murder", "women" and "children" hammered from it leaving the plaque unreadable.

Inverell police Senior Constable Chris Curtin said that "We got reports [from a local &lt;a href="w%3Aaboriganal"&gt;aboriganal&lt;/a&gt; elder] that deep gouges have been scratched into the plaques along the memorial walk. Several of the plaques will have to be replaced."

The &lt;a href="w%3AGovernment%20of%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;NSW government&lt;/a&gt; has reacted to the event by calling the vandalism an appalling and insulting crime. "This is a gross act of vandalism, Defacing this memorial is disrespectful and insulting to the people who were murdered, and their families." Aboriginal Affairs Minister Andrew Refshauge said.

"All you're doing is really showing the blackness in your own heart, the sadness of your own spirit - there is much more at stake here than that," Mr Refshauge continued. "The reconciliation of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people in the region is already a powerful movement - join it, don't trash it."

The Myall Creek massacre is particually important in &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20History"&gt;Australian history&lt;/a&gt;, as it marks the first time that &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean"&gt;European&lt;/a&gt;s were charged and convicted of murdering Aborigines. "It was the first occasion when European law was applied to deliver justice for Aboriginal people," Mr Refshauge said. "That's why this act of vandalism is especially appalling."

Metlife announced on 01/31/05 that they were going to acquire Travelers Life and Annuity from Citigroup. Travelers Life and Annuity is an insurance underwriter. MetLife is a large life insurance and annuities underwriter. MetLife will have to borrow a lot of money to pay for the company, so rating agencies like S&amp;P warn that the AA credit rating of MetLife might be lowered. This would cause the interest rates at which all of MetLife's debt must be repaid to increase.

Citigroup committed to continue distributing Travelers life insurance and annuities through its Smith Barney stock brokers, Primerica agents, and Citibank branches. 

Citigroup was previously known as Travelers Insurance before it bought Citicorp. First the Property and Casualty business of Travelers was spun off, and now the life insurance division has been sold off. This is primarily because insurance underwriters get a lower price to earnings multiple from the stock market because of the cycles and uncertainty associated with the insurance business. Also, having an insurance underwriter and a bank together does not usually create "cross-sell" opportunities, because consumers and businesses almost always buy life insurance and annuities through brokers who have a duty to give them other options. Citigroup will continue to sell insurance through its brokers as before.

&lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Pedro%20Sula"&gt;San Pedro Sula&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHonduras"&gt;Honduras&lt;/a&gt; – The Virgin of Suyapa, a 6cm high statue that is the patron saint of Honduras, was brought to the local suburb of Eben Ezer in &lt;a href="w%3AChamelec%C3%B3n"&gt;Chamelecón&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Pedro%20Sula"&gt;San Pedro Sula&lt;/a&gt;, after the residents of this area experienced the massacre of 27 people returning home by bus on 23rd December 2004. A further 29 were left injured. Many thousands of people from all over come to Suyapa, a suburb of the capital , to celebrate her name day in early February, and she made this visit yesterday, Sunday January 30th, as a part of this year's celebrations. 

Her presence was heavily guarded by a contingent of armed military troops, as this statue has already been stolen more than once, though always recovered later. A minute's silence was held at the spot where the massacre took place. The nationally well known bishop's assistant Rómulo Emiliani led the ceremonies.

BAGHDAD, Iraq – A British Royal Air Force C-130K &lt;a href="w%3A%20c130"&gt;Hercules&lt;/a&gt; transport aircraft crashed 30 km north of &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, killing ten service people.

&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUSA"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt; – 
&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; Secretary General &lt;a href="w%3AKofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt; has noted that the Iraqi people turned out in large numbers to vote in the January 30 ballot. Voters were deciding who to elect to the 275 seat Transitional National Assembly.

Sporadic violence saw the deaths of 22 people across the country during voting, but attacks by insurgents did not seem to deter voters from exercising their new democratic rights. Annan praised the courage of the people and congratulated the Independent Election Commission of Iraq (IECI) and UN officials for successfully running the poll.

The Secretary General went on to say that the success bodes well for the on-going transition process. The next step will be a referendum in October 2005 on the constitution the Transitional National Assembly will be tasked with drawing up.

In the Out-of-Country Voting Program, 93.6% of Iraqis eligible to vote, did so.

Four prisoners at Camp Bucca Theatre Internment Facility near Umm Qasr in southern &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, were killed by &lt;a href="w%3AUSA"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; guards during a riot that broke out at the facility yesterday. The US military has also stated that 6 other detainees were injured during the riot.

A statement from the US military said that the riot started just after noon, in one of the camp's ten compounds, following a routine search for &lt;a href="w%3Acontraband"&gt;contraband&lt;/a&gt;.

"The riot quickly spread to three additional compounds, with detainees throwing rocks and fashioning weapons from materials inside their living areas," the statement said. "Guards attempted to calm the increasingly volatile situation using verbal warnings and, when that failed, by use of non-lethal force. After about 45 minutes of escalating danger, lethal force was used to quell the violence." The statement said.

"The cause of the riot and use of lethal force is currently under investigation by the chain of command and the US Army's Criminal Investigations Division, which is standard procedure whenever a detainee death occurs," the statement continued.

BAQDAD, Iraq – 
The Iraqis turned out in large numbers to the national election of January 30, 2005, risking their lives and ignoring the threats and attacks of terrorist groups. The rebels caused at least 44 deaths during the election. Ten of the deaths were caused by suicide attacks. The &lt;a href="w%3AAl-Qaeda"&gt;Al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; organization announced on a website that 13 suicide attackers participated in the attacks.

Despite the violence, a 'loosely estimated' 60% of the 14 million registered electors appeared to vote, according to the Electoral Commission. &lt;a href="w%3AProportional%20representation"&gt;Proportional representation&lt;/a&gt; was the voting method used to select the members for a 275-strong assembly that will then draw up a &lt;a href="w%3Aconstitution"&gt;constitution&lt;/a&gt;. The Iraqis faced up to threats, attacks, and the inconvenience of long lines caused by the security measures at polling booths.

This was the first free election held in Iraq in over 50 years. The 2005 Iraq election was very different than the previous one in 2002 during the regime of &lt;a href="w%3ASaddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt;. At that time the Iraq elector was offered "yes" or "no" choices in a referendum for the only candidate, &lt;a href="w%3ASaddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt;. The results of that election showed 100 percent in favor of Hussein in a 100 percent turnout. That election was called the mother of all election frauds, since any Iraqi elector who didn't appear and vote for Hussein was condemned to death. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0%2C%2C3-441828%2C00.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/10/16/attack/main525770.shtml"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 

Mahdeya Saleh, an 80 year old Iraqi citizen said: "I had often been forced to vote under Saddam Hussein. Today I come out of my own will to choose freely the candidate of my choice for the first and last time in my life." &lt;a href="http%3A//www.theallineed.com/news/0501/301061.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

"Why should I be afraid?" Arifa Abed Mohamed told a Christian Science Monitor reporter at a Baghdad polling station. "I am afraid only from God."

Other Iraqis expressed a similar disregard for the rebels’ threats. “I would have crawled here if I had to,” Samir Hassan told a Reuters reporter. “I don’t want terrorists to kill other Iraqis like they tried to kill me.” Hassan lost his leg in an October 2004 car-bomb attack.

AUSTRALIA – Margaret Pardoel, mother of the first Australian soldier to be killed in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; since the commencement of &lt;a href="w%3A2003%20Invasion%20of%20Iraq"&gt;hostilities&lt;/a&gt;, has expressed anger over the death of her only son, a father of three, who was about to return home to Australia and had been planning a career change. Mrs Pardoel and husband John were devastated by the loss of their only son.

Mrs Pardoel said she opposes the war. "I think it's just cold-blooded murder. Look at all those young American boys that have been slaughtered," she said. "I don't think this should have gone on ... He said to me one night he phoned, he said, 'Mum there's nowhere to hide here, it's just so dangerous, there's nowhere to hide'." 

Thirty-five year old Flight Lieutenant Paul Pardoel had been on his last flight when the &lt;a href="w%3AC-130%20Hercules"&gt;C-130 Hercules&lt;/a&gt; he was aboard &lt;a href="RAF%20Hercules%20crashes%20north%20of%20Baghdad%20killing%20ten"&gt;crashed north of Baghdad&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, killing ten personnel. He was serving with the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Royal%20Air%20Force"&gt;British Royal Air Force (RAF)&lt;/a&gt;, to which he had transferred several years ago from the &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Australian%20Air%20Force"&gt;Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF)&lt;/a&gt;, as Navigator in 47 Squadron Lyneham RAF.

Mr Pardoel had been expecting to return in July to his wife and three children in Australia, where they had recently bought a new house in Canberra.

&lt;a href="w%3AMinister%20for%20Foreign%20Affairs%20%28Australia%29"&gt;Australian Foreign Affairs Minister&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Downer"&gt;Alexander Downer&lt;/a&gt;, says he is saddened to hear of the man's death.

"I want his family to know, and his friends to know, that he certainly did not die in vain, that this tragic accident occurred - or this tragedy because it may not have been an accident - but this tragedy occurred on a day when &lt;a href="Kofi%20Annan%20notes%20high%20turnout%20in%202005%20Iraq%20elections"&gt;65 per cent of the people of Iraq&lt;/a&gt; went out and &lt;a href="First%20free%20Iraqi%20election%20begins%3B%20insurgents%20strike"&gt;voted&lt;/a&gt;," he said.

Kathmandu, Nepal – The King of &lt;a href="Nepal"&gt;Nepal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGyanendra%20Bir%20Bikram%20Shah%20Dev"&gt;Gyanendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , has dissolved the coalition government, accusing it of factional fighting and failing in its duty to protect democracy. Several key political figures in the old coalition have been put under house arrest, including the leader of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANepal%20Communist%20Party"&gt;Nepal Communist Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The king has said that he removed the government of Prime Minister &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASher%20Bahadur%20Deuba"&gt;Sher Bahadur Deuba&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; because "it has failed to make necessary arrangements to hold elections by April and protect democracy, the sovereignty of the people and life and property". The king had repeatedly called on Deuba to set a date for elections despite threats by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMaoist"&gt;Maoist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; rebels to block any vote.

"I have exercised my rights given to the crown under the present constitution and I have, therefore, dissolved the government for the larger interests," the king said.

This announcement occurs with the backdrop of a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANepalese%20People%27s%20War"&gt;continuing civil war&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; which has claimed the lives of more than 11,000 people since 1996.

Bucharest, Romania – A survey by the Romanian Institute for Marketing and Polling (IMAS) shows that 64% of the country's citizens consider that things are moving in the right direction and are optimistic about the future of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARomania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;. 

Additionally, 59% consider that the current centre-right liberal government, led by &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ACalin%20Popescu-Tariceanu"&gt;Călin Popescu Tăriceanu&lt;/a&gt;, will do a better job than the previous social-democrat government under &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AAdrian%20Nastase"&gt;Adrian Năstase&lt;/a&gt;.

The surveyed people were also asked who they would vote for if an election were held now. 66% said they would choose the governing &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ATruth%20and%20Justice"&gt;Truth and Justice Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, while only 19% said they would back the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASocial%20Democrat%20Party%20of%20Romania"&gt;Social Democrats&lt;/a&gt;. This is one of the lowest approval rates for the Social Democrats ever, especially considering that they achieved 37% of the vote in the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARomanian%20legislative%20elections%2C%202004"&gt;November legislative elections&lt;/a&gt;, and the Social Democrats' Adrian Năstase only narrowly lost to current president &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ATraian%20Basescu"&gt;Traian Băsescu&lt;/a&gt; in the December run-off election, getting 48.77% of the electorate's vote.

In terms of individual politicians, Presdient Traian Băsescu has the highest approval rating, with 73% trusting him. The next most trusted is the Prime Minister, Călin Popescu Tăriceanu, of the Truth and Justice Alliance. He has an approval rating of 64%.

Perhaps shockingly, the poll shows that the far-right nationalist &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AGreat%20Romania%20Party"&gt;Great Romania Party&lt;/a&gt; leader, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ACorneliu%20Vadim%20Tudor"&gt;Corneliu Vadim Tudor&lt;/a&gt;, has an approval rating of 21%, while the interim Social Democrat leader Victor Ponta has an approval rating of only 15%.

This dramatic fall in the Social Democrats' popularity is expected to change Romanian politics significantly, considering that , after the fall of Communism in Romania, they dominated politics for most of the years up until the present.

What matters most, though, is that in Romania at present, most people trust the people which elected as their leaders, something which is crucial at a time when Romania must implement important reforms to prepare for accession to the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; in 2007.

&lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;LONDON&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; – 
According to the British &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; election was a blow against global terrorism. He vowed to stand by Iraq as it moves to build a democracy and paid tribute to British military personnel who died in a plane crash on election day.

In a nationally broadcast statement, Blair said: "It was moving and humbling for those of us lucky enough to live in a democracy and take it for granted, to see the enthusiasm and the simple determination, the clear sight of courage of millions of Iraqis that came out to vote for the first time in their lives, despite the terrorism, despite the threats, despite the dangers...Democracy in Iraq is not just good for Iraq itself. It is also a blow right to the heart of the global terrorism that threatens destruction not just in Iraq but in Britain and virtually every major country around the world."

President Bush also spoke of the incident, saying he mourns the British and American military personnel who died on Sunday.

WASHINGTON, D.C – US students are apathetic about their &lt;a href="w%3AFirst%20Amendment"&gt;First Amendment&lt;/a&gt; rights to &lt;a href="w%3Afree%20speech"&gt;free speech&lt;/a&gt;, according to the largest study of its kind, released today by The John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. Most students surveyed said they believed flag burning is illegal, half that the government can censor the internet, and half that government approval should be required for stories published in the press.

“These results are not only disturbing; they are dangerous,” said Knight Foundation President and CEO Hodding Carter III. “Ignorance about the basics of this free society is a danger to our nation’s future.”

Researchers from the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Connecticut"&gt;University of Connecticut&lt;/a&gt; questioned more than 100,000 high school students, nearly 8,000 teachers, and more than 500 administrators and principals, in a two-year study costing US$1 million. Entitled ♡❤The Future of the First Amendment♡❤, the study was commissioned by the Florida-based John S. and James L. Knight Foundation.

According to the study, teaching of First Amendment values is effective in redressing the types of misunderstandings revealed, but it concludes even the basics are not being taught effectively now.

Appreciation and understanding of the rights were much greater amongst teachers, principals and adults, studied in this, and other recent studies. In contrast, students were more likely than others to think that potentially offensive song lyrics should be allowed, and student publications should not require approval from the school authorities.

Other findings included that one in five schools offer no student media whatsoever, and that finances limit the ability of administrators to offer such opportunities for student expression, particularly for low income, inner city and regional schools; and that student participation in student media increased appreciation for First Amendment rights.

South America – 
The President of &lt;a href="w%3AColombia"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAlvaro%20Uribe"&gt;Alvaro Uribe&lt;/a&gt; is scheduled to meet the President of &lt;a href="w%3AVenezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AHugo%20Ch%C3%A1vez"&gt;Hugo Chávez&lt;/a&gt; Thursday. Apparently the crisis between Venezuela and Colombia is almost solved. The crisis began with the imprisonment of the alleged &lt;a href="w%3AFARC"&gt;FARC&lt;/a&gt; member Rodrigo Granda by Colombian forces on December 13, 2004. Venezuela accused Colombian of invading Venezuelan territory. Colombia accused Venezuela of harboring FARC terrorists.
The President of &lt;a href="w%3ACuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFidel%20Castro"&gt;Fidel Castro&lt;/a&gt;, intervened in the crisis and talked to Chavez and Uribe. 

According to Bogota's newspaper El Tiempo, Uribe asked for Castro's help on January 21. Castro responded with surprising speed and effectiveness. On January 21 Castro sent the chancellor Felipe Perez Roque to &lt;a href="w%3ACaracas"&gt;Caracas&lt;/a&gt; where he met with Chávez and then returned to Havana, informing Castro on the results of the encounter. After midnight Castro communicated by telephone with Uribe for two hours. They decided that Castro would send his Vice-chancellor with a letter detailing what they had talked about to Chávez. 

During the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Social%20Forum"&gt;World Social Forum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3APorto%20Alegre"&gt;Porto Alegre&lt;/a&gt; Chavez appeared to be optimistic about the end of the crisis. He recognized the importance of Castro's role in the resolution of the problems between Colombia and Venezuela. Also he was thankful for the help of the other leaders in South America.

The crisis between Venezuela and Colombia lasted more than a month without a solution and it was entering a dangerous stage, with severe accusations from both sides. During recent days the US government became more interested in the conflict and was pressuring Chávez for a clear declaration about his relationship with the FARC. The &lt;a href="w%3AUSA"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; is an ally of Colombia in the fight against FARC. FARC is a member of, and supported by, the &lt;a href="w%3AForo%20de%20S%C3%A3o%20Paulo"&gt;Foro de São Paulo&lt;/a&gt;, an alleged anti-imperialism and anti-liberalism organization of &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20America"&gt;South America&lt;/a&gt;. Other Forum de São Paulo member states include &lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AVenezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;.

He will visit the hospital which reopened recently with the help of Australian and German military doctors, and also take a helicopter tour of tsunami-ravaged coastal areas. He will also hold talks with senior Indonesian ministers who are overseeing relief efforts.

Australia has committed AUD$1 Billion in aid over five years to the tsunami recovery, it's largest ever foreign aid program.

US based &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANon-governmental%20organization"&gt;NGO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHuman%20Rights%20Watch"&gt;Human Rights Watch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has criticised the &lt;a href="United%20States%20of%20America"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; attempts to block the &lt;a href="UN"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUN%20Security%20Council"&gt;Security Council&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from referring atrocities in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADarfur%20conflict"&gt;Darfur conflict&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; region to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Criminal%20Court"&gt;International Criminal Court&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (ICC). The US favours setting up an ad hoc tribunal instead. HRW claims that the resulting delay will lead to the loss of more innocent lives. 

The US has long opposed the ICC, because of concerns over politically motivated prosecutions of it's citizens. 

A report prepared by a five member UN commission noted "killing of civilians, enforced disappearances, destruction of villages, rape and other forms of sexual violence, pillaging and forced displacement, throughout Darfur", and secretly named alleged war criminals that should go before the ICC. 

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APierre-Richard%20Prosper"&gt;Pierre-Richard Prosper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the U.S. ambassador-at-large for war crimes, said "We don't want to be party to legitimizing the ICC." 

In the last two years in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADarfur"&gt;Darfur&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; region more than 70,000 people have been killed, and over 2 million displaced.

<h2>US opposition to ICC</h2>
The United States, which signed but did not ratify the statute during the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Clinton"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; administration, withdrew its support soon after &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; assumed the presidency. It signed the ICC Statute at the last minute, primarily so that it could continue to take part in negotiations on the rules of procedure for the new court, in an attempt to obtain an exemption for U.S. nationals taking part in UN-sponsored peacekeeping missions--as several other countries were able to do. The U.S. fears that American soldiers and political leaders may be subject to frivolous or politically motivated prosecutions.

U.S. opponents of the ICC maintain that in cases where the U.S. failed to act quickly enough to prevent disaster the U.S. has been criticized for allowing genocide to occur (e.g. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARwanda"&gt;Rwanda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; :&lt;a href="http%3A//www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/2000/07/09/stories/0109000c.htm"&gt;♡❤"Rwanda: U.S., France blamed for genocide"♡❤&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http%3A//www.commondreams.org/headlines04/0406-08.htm"&gt;♡❤"Rwanda-US: Intelligence Warned Early of Genocide, New Papers Show"♡❤&lt;/a&gt;); in cases where the U.S. ♡❤has♡❤ acted quickly they have been criticized and even accused of war crimes (e.g. Yugoslavia, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASomalia"&gt;Somalia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; :&lt;a href="http%3A//agitprop.org.au/stopnato/20000323robyuguard.php"&gt;♡❤"Yugoslavia: US Terrorism"♡❤&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.boycottusa.org/usa_crimes_somalia.htm"&gt;♡❤"American Slaughter of People in Somalia"♡❤&lt;/a&gt;).

Furthermore, opponents contend that the neither the ICC nor the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; has any real power to enforce the extradition of war criminals from signatory states. Therefore, any kind of military action to force compliance would have to be undertaken (in large part) by the U.S., action which would expose U.S. officials to spurious charges of war crimes.

&lt;a href="w%3APope%20John%20Paul%20II"&gt;Pope John Paul II&lt;/a&gt; has been taken to hospital and is suffering from a "breathing crisis", the &lt;a href="w%3AVatican"&gt;Vatican&lt;/a&gt; has confirmed.

The Vatican said in a statement that the Pope, 84, is suffering from an acute respiratory infection. He was admitted to the Gemelli Polyclinic Hospital at 2300 local time (2200 UTC).

According to the Vatican the Pontiff is suffering from an acute inflammation of the larynx as well as laryngo-spasms that constrict the lung's intake of air. He was diagnosed with a severe &lt;a href="w%3Aflu"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; three days ago and taken to Gamelli as a precaution. 

The Pope is no stranger to Gemelli Polyclinic Hospital. In 1981 he was taken there after being shot in the abdomen by Mehmet Ali Agca and he has been re-admitted at least three times since.

Although the Vatican usually does not comment on the pontiff's state of health, it is widely known that the Pope suffers from Parkinson's disease, and chronic joint problems.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; churches have begun a public campaign opposing late-term &lt;a href="w%3Aabortion"&gt;abortion&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AAnglican"&gt;Anglican&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACatholic"&gt;Catholic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABaptist"&gt;Baptist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APresbyterian"&gt;Presbyterian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABuddhist"&gt;Buddhist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHindu"&gt;Hindu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALutheran"&gt;Lutheran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASikh"&gt;Sikh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASalvation%20Army"&gt;Salvation Army&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AWesleyan"&gt;Wesleyan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASeventh-Day%20Adventist"&gt;Seventh-Day Adventist&lt;/a&gt; religious groups issued a signed statement yesterday calling for laws limiting abortions after a pregnancy has reached its 20th week. 

The statement also calls for information to be provided to women considering abortion. They should receive detailed information about the health risks, the stage of the actual foetal development and the exact nature of the medical procedure. Additionally, a seven day "cooling down period" should follow initial counseling to give women more time to consider their decision.

But according to the document, the concerned church leaders are also aware that public opinion in Australia is predominantly &lt;a href="w%3Apro-choice"&gt;pro-choice&lt;/a&gt;.

And &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; Premier &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Carr"&gt;Bob Carr&lt;/a&gt; has revealed that of 31,600 abortions in NSW last year, only 200 were in fact late term. 

Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; has welcomed the renewed debate about abortion without committing himself yet.

&lt;a href="w%3AKathmandu"&gt;Kathmandu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANepal"&gt;Nepal&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;a href="w%3AGyanendra%20of%20Nepal"&gt;King Gyanendra&lt;/a&gt; of Nepal has today announced a new 10-member cabinet, after yesterday sacking the coalition government. The King, who some Nepalis view as a &lt;a href="w%3Areincarnation"&gt;reincarnation&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AHindu"&gt;Hindu&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Agod"&gt;god&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AVishnu"&gt;Vishnu&lt;/a&gt;, made the announcement on the state run television and radio service. "A new Cabinet will be formed under my leadership," he said. "This will restore peace and effective democracy in this country within the next three years."

Gyanendra named Rames Nath Pandey as foreign minister, Dan Bahadur Shahi as Home Minister, as well as Radha Krishna Mainali, a member of the communist party, as minister for sports and education. The king has decided to head the new administration himself, after accusing the old administration of failing to ensure the small nation's security. Nepal is in the midst of a &lt;a href="w%3AMaoist"&gt;Maoist&lt;/a&gt; insurgency that has claimed more than 11,000 lives since 1996. 

All telephone lines and mobile telephone networks have been cut with the outside world. Flights into and out of the capital of Kathmandu, have also been stopped. However one flight did leave for &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Delhi"&gt;New Delhi&lt;/a&gt; overnight. Local radio stations are also reported to have been shut down, and Nepali websites are inaccessible from outside Nepal.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABritain"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; criticized the king's action, and Australia has advised its citizens not to travel to Nepal.

Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General of the UN has said that the king's actions are "a serious setback for the country ... steps should be taken immediately to restore democratic freedoms and institutions" The US administration added that the sacking was a "step back from democracy" and &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; joined into the chorus by saying that the developments were a "cause of grave concern". The UK, the USA and India have all provided Nepal with arms and given the army training under the banner of security aid. The &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Nepalese%20Army"&gt;Nepalese army&lt;/a&gt; has tripled in size in less than 10 years. The US alone is estimated to have supplied 20,000 M-16 rifles as well as night-vision and communications equipment, and counter-insurgency training.

The Indian Express newspaper is reporting that the Indian government tried to dissuade King Gyanendra from a "power grab" a few weeks ago.

A statement from &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Delhi"&gt;New Delhi&lt;/a&gt; said ""These developments constitute a serious setback to the cause of democracy in Nepal and cannot but be a cause of grave concern to India," an Indian foreign ministry statement said. The latest developments in Nepal bring the monarchy and the mainstream political parties in direct confrontation with each other. This can only benefit the forces that not only wish to undermine democracy but the institution of monarchy as well." India shares an open border with Nepal. 

The leader of the Maoist rebels, &lt;a href="w%3APrachanda"&gt;Prachanda&lt;/a&gt;, likened the kings actions to "medieval feudal autocracy", and said that the King was trying "to push the Nepalese society of the 21st century back to the 15th.". In a statement to a [cpnm.org Maoist website] he said "We heartily call upon the entire pro-people forces of the world to raise their voices against this autocratic step and in the favor of the Nepalese people's democratic movement,"

Prachanda, denounced King Gyanendra as a "national betrayer" and told Nepalis to "shut down Nepal" in a three day &lt;a href="w%3AGeneral%20Strike"&gt;general strike&lt;/a&gt; from Wednesday to Friday, however witnesses in Kathmandu said life was going on as normal, and there are no obvious signs of additional security. Meenakshi, a street sweeper outside the gates of the King's palace said "I just don't know anything. I am just here like any other day," The King has imposed a state of emergency which forbids mass gatherings.

The new drugs are Risperdal Consta, for the treatment of schizophrenia, and Zyprexa, for the treatment of bipolar one disorder.

The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is a programme that provides heavily subsidised prescription drugs to all citizens and residents of Australia. Most necessary medicines are included in the list of medicines covered by the PBS. 

The Federal Government through the PBS purchases medication in bulk from drug companies at a pre-agreed price. The consumer then buys the medicine from his/her pharmacist at a subsidised price and the PBS covers the difference between the bulk purchase cost and the consumer price.

&lt;a href="w%3AIpswich"&gt;Ipswich&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AQueensland"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt; – Dennis Ferguson, a convicted paedophile has become the center of a row between Ipswich Mayor Paul Pisale, and Queensland Premier, Peter Beattie. Mr Ferguson moved to Ipswich, north of &lt;a href="w%3ABrisbane"&gt;Brisbane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; after being forced out of his previous home by picketers in &lt;a href="w%3AMurgon"&gt;Murgon&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Burnett"&gt;South Burnett&lt;/a&gt; region of Queensland yesterday.

A group of protesters have now gathered outside Mr Ferguson's new home in Ipswich, who at one stage threw rocks at the house. The Mayor has defended the actions of the protesters saying "All the residents are doing is showing their democratic right - what they feel - and I think that in this country, they have a right to do that," he said.

"I think the only thing left is institutionalise. I think that's the only thing left in this community because you just can't keep shifting the problem all over the state and all over the country until people start showing signs of remorse and show signs of whether they've been rehabilitated."

However the Premier of Queensland, Peter Beattie, reponded by asking Mayor Paul Pisale what he meant by "institutionalised". "To do what?" he said."Okay, so you actually believe that somebody should be locked up forever? We have laws in this state now, and I will talk to Paul about this, which basically say that a paedophile will not be released if they're a danger to the community."

But the Deputy Opposition Leader Jeff Seeney says that in Mr Ferguson's case "Those laws have failed," he said. "He needs to go into an institution and Peter Beattie has a responsibility to ensure that people such as that are kept in an institution."

&lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;LONDON&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUK"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; – 

An overhaul of Incapacity Benefit is due to be announced in Parliament today.

The payments are likely to be renamed and there could be financial penalties on those who do not actively seek work.

The benefit, given to those unable to return to work, currently varied between £56 a week to £74.

Under Labour proposals, a flat-rate of £56 would be introduced. But financial penalites will be taken on those who do not attempt to look for work, if they are able to.

Incentives will be offered for claimants to undergo training, rehabilitation classes and attend work-focused interviews.

Charities such as Leonard Chesire have voiced concerns that the plans could damage disabled people already living in poverty.

"People whose condition causes them pain or fatigue should not be forced to look for employment," said a spokesman for the disability charity.

The have claimed that the proposals will not work, and have suggested that a scheme run by the voluntary and private sector could get 250,000 people into jobs.

The accused Labour of applying a "one-size-fits-all" approach.

&lt;a href="w%3ABras%C3%ADlia"&gt;BRASILIA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; – 
The Brazilian government has proposed a policy to increase external control on public and private &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity"&gt;Universities&lt;/a&gt;. The Brazilian magazine Veja published a cover story about the subject criticizing this proposal&lt;a href="http%3A//veja.abril.com.br/idade/exclusivo/260105/sumario.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. 

The magazine put a picture of a &lt;a href="http%3A//veja.abril.com.br/idade/exclusivo/260105/capa.html"&gt;donkey&lt;/a&gt; on the cover, a critical allusion to the recent political decisions related to Education taken by the government (in Brazil the donkey is a symbol of stupidity). The magazine claims the recent decision of the government's new education policy is motivated more by ideological rather than technical reasons.

On June 06, 2004 during a convention of intellectuals, the president of the Confenen (National Confederation of the Educational establishments) Robert Dornas said the idea of external control conflicts with the idea of the university autonomy. "This is the way of all totalitarian States" , he added.

The Vice-chancellor of the UFRJ (Federal University of Rio De Janeiro), Aloísio Teixeira, said to fear that the advice finishes obliquing the activities of the university. According to him the university should be evaluated by already existing mechanisms, as the National Congress. Pablo Alcântara Gomes, the chairman of the board of the Brazilian Universities’ Vice-chancellors, said Brazilian universities do not need external control, but internal advice with participation of the society.

There are worries that with the external control universities may be subject only to political and ideological oriented decisions of non-representative groups. 

The Ministry of Education Tarso Genro is a defender of the external control: "I am enthusiastic about the external control. Me and my friend Olívio Dutra (minister of the Cities), are the founders of the shared public budget program in &lt;a href="w%3APorto%20Alegre"&gt;Porto Alegre&lt;/a&gt;. This model of management worked like a organized social external control over what is the exposed power nerve, the public budget. And it worked. Therefore, I think it is a good thing. We have to enrich what is not the State, but the public space."

&lt;a href="w%3AEben%20Moglen"&gt;Eben Moglen&lt;/a&gt;, Columbia University Law Professor, will head the new
Software Freedom Law Center (SFLC). An initial 4 million dollars has been provided by Open Source Development Labs (OSDL) to fund the project.

The law center will provide free legal service for &lt;a href="w%3Aopen%20source"&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt; projects and developers. In 2004 OSDL established a separate $10 million Linux Legal Defense Fund providing legal support for &lt;a href="w%3ALinus%20Torvalds"&gt;Linus Torvalds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALinux%20Kernel"&gt;Linux kernel&lt;/a&gt; creator and end user companies subjected to Linux-related litigation by the &lt;a href="w%3ASCO"&gt;SCO&lt;/a&gt; Group. The new law center will not be affiliated with the OSDL.

"This is about taking care of the goose that laid the golden egg and not letting wolves come in the middle of the night and steal it away," Moglen said during a press conference. "This is a legal firm not involved so much in litigating and defending as it will be for counseling and advising and nurturing non-profits and to prevent millions of dollars in litigation."

Moglen will serve as chairman and director-counsel of the non-profit organization. Also on board as directors are: &lt;a href="w%3ALawrence%20Lessig"&gt;Lawrence Lessig&lt;/a&gt;, law professor at Stanford Law School; Daniel Weitzner, director of the &lt;a href="w%3AW3"&gt;World Wide Web Consortium&lt;/a&gt;'s technology and society activities; and Diane Peters, general counsel at the OSDL. Daniel Ravicher, executive director of the Public Patent Foundation, will help manage as legal director.

Moglen, one of the world.s leading experts on copyright law as applied to software, will run the new Law Center from its headquarters in New York City. The Law Center will initially have two full-time intellectual property attorneys on staff and expects to expand to four attorneys later this year. Initial clients for the Law Center include the Free Software Foundation and the Samba Project.

Other services provided by the SFLC include: asset stewardship, to avoid intellectual property claim conflict; license review and compatibility analysis; legal consulting and lawyer training.

&lt;a href="w%3ABAGHDAD"&gt;BAGHDAD&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; – 
The Iraqi President &lt;a href="w%3AGhazi%20Mashal%20Ajil%20al-Yawer"&gt;Ghazi Mashal Ajil al-Yawer&lt;/a&gt; said yesterday, on February 01 2005, that the US and other foreign troops should remain in Iraq. "It's only complete nonsense to ask the troops to leave in this chaos and this vacuum of power." 

He expects foreign troops to leave after insurgent groups have been defeated, the security situation has been improved and Iraq's own security forces are strengthened. "By the end of this year, we could see the number of foreign troops decreasing," he added. 

Other Iraqi ministers echoed the President's statement.

"We don't want to have foreign troops in our country" said Hazem Shaalan, the Iraq Defence Minister.

"But at the same time, we believe that these forces should stay for some time until we are able to control the borders and establish a new modern army and we have efficient intelligence."

"At that time ... we'll ask them to leave."

The reason behind Bolivia's rejection of the Chilean candidate is the ongoing dispute between Chile and Bolivia that began with the in 1879 and resulted in Bolivia losing it's maritime border (and thus maritime access) at . Bolivia is still demanding maritime access, something Chile refuses to give. Bolivia thus believes that Mr Insulza would be incapable of finding a solution to what Bolivia feels is it's legitimate demand for maritime access were he to become the OAS Secretary General. While Bolivia believes that the OAS is the right multilateral forum to address this issue Chile claims that it is an issue between Bolivia and Chile, and should not concern other nations, a viewpoint that Mr Insulza has himself expressed.

The Bolivian ambassador to the OAS María Tamayo Arnal pointed out that in 1979 and 1989 the OAS approved resolutions stating that Bolivia's lack of maritime access was of hemispherical interest.

&lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;'s Swift satellite has completed all tests since
its launch last November and with the &lt;a href="w%3AUVOT"&gt;Ultravioliet/Optical Telescope&lt;/a&gt;
(UVOT) now on line, is now fully functional for the mission's 2 year quest
for &lt;a href="w%3AGamma%20ray%20burster"&gt;gamma-ray burst&lt;/a&gt;s.

The UVOT was tested on the &lt;a href="w%3ANGC%205457"&gt;Pinwheel Galaxy&lt;/a&gt; (M101).

"After many years of effort building the UVOT, it was exciting to
point it toward the famous Pinwheel Galaxy, M101," said Dr. Peter
Roming, UVOT Lead Scientist at Penn State University. "The ultraviolet
wavelengths in particular reveal regions of star formation in the
galaxy's wispy spiral arms. But more than a pretty image, this
first-light observation is a test of the UVOT's capabilities."

Gamma ray bursts are some of the most powerful objects observed
in the Universe and are thought to signal the birth of black
holes.

Swift is designed to detect the bursts and automatically
re-orient itself to gather images and data of the phenomenon.
Swift detected and imaged its first official burst on January 17,
2005, before the UVOT was operational with the aid of the &lt;a href="w%3ABAT"&gt;Burst
Alert&lt;/a&gt; (BAT) and &lt;a href="w%3AXRT"&gt;X-ray&lt;/a&gt; (XRT) telescopes activated several weeks
earlier. The BAT detects the gamma-ray bursts, automatically and
immediately turns the telescope, bringing the XRT
and UVOT to bear on the location of the event which record
detailed observations of the burst afterglow.

The UVOT is a joint product of &lt;a href="w%3APennsylvania%20State%20University"&gt;Penn State University&lt;/a&gt; and the Mullard Space
Science Laboratory.

&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; – The whole of the east coast of &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; has been lashed by severe storms in the last 24 hours, with at least one reported death. Wind gusts in some areas reached 110 kilometers per hour, and flash flooding and power cuts were reported from Far North &lt;a href="Queensland"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="Tasmania"&gt;Tasmania&lt;/a&gt; in the South.

State Emergency Services (SES) crews are stretched to the limit, working into the night to cope with the effects of the freak weather.

<h2>Queensland</h2>

Around 29,000 homes in Queensland experienced power outages.

Sixty millimetres of rain fell in an hour on the region around Herberton, in Far North Queensland. A man and woman were rescued from nearby Sandy Creek after their car was swept off the road while trying to cross the Creek during heavy storms last night.

The man had escaped to cling to a tree, but lost sight of his wife as the car was washed away. Rescuers later found the woman on the bank. Neither was seriously injured.

About 150 kilometres to the south-west, a search continues for missing stockman, a 38-year-old from Carpentaria Downs Station near Einasleigh who failed to return after checking fences yesterday.

<h2>&lt;a href="New%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;</h2>

Heavy rain and large hailstones pummelled Sydney and the Central Coast.

The NSW &lt;a href="w%3AState%20Emergency%20Service"&gt;State Emergency Service&lt;/a&gt; reported receiving more than 2,300 requests for assistance, mostly in Western &lt;a href="Sydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGosford"&gt;Gosford&lt;/a&gt;. 

"Most of those jobs have been for hail damage to roofs, fallen trees on houses and across roads, flash flooding and water getting into properties," said SES spokesman David Webber. 

Around 100,000 homes in NSW experienced power outages. 

In the southern Sydney suburb of Bexley North three people were rescued from vehicles when they attempted to drive along a flooded road, and a girl was killed near Mittagong when a tree fell on the tent in which she was sleeping. 

<h2>&lt;a href="Victoria%2C%20Australia"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt;</h2>

&lt;a href="Melbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; has been hit by severe flooding as wild storms and heavy rain strike the east coast of Australia. With triple the city's average February rainfall in just 24 hours, major roads and train lines have been cut and travel is extremely difficult.

A search involving police and State Emergency Service volunteers is currently underway for a schoolboy, believed to have been swept into floodwaters north of Werribee, and a 10 year old girl narrowly escaped being killed when a tree fell through the house in which she was sleeping. The tree missed her by centimeters. She was trapped for an hour before being freed by emergency services and taken to the Royal Childrens Hospital in a serious condition.

The &lt;a href="w%3ASpirit%20of%20Tasmania"&gt;Spirit of Tasmania I&lt;/a&gt; was also forced to return to &lt;a href="w%3AStation%20Pier"&gt;Station Pier&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href="w%3APort%20Melbourne"&gt;Port Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, after windows were broken when the &lt;a href="w%3ABass%20Strait"&gt;Bass Strait&lt;/a&gt; ferry encountered 20 metre waves caused by the gale force winds. 

The city received 120mm of rain in the 24 hours to 9am, while the average monthly rainfall for February is 45mm. Making this the largest measured rainfall in a 24 hour period for &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; since records began in 1856. The rainfall stopped sometime this afternoon local time. Authorities urged people to stay away from Melbourne city centre.

<h2>Tasmania</h2>
<h2>South Australia</h2>

&lt;a href="South%20Australia"&gt;South Australia&lt;/a&gt; has, for the first time in 27 years, experienced hail in February.

&lt;a href="w%3ABeijing"&gt;BEIJING&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; – According to a story released on January 26, 2005 by the Chinese news agency Xinhua, the government of China has banned 50 electronic games in a new government probe into the software market and electronic publication. 

The Director of the State Anti-Pornography Office, Liu Binjie, said that the Chinese government will concentrate on combating illegal publications: pirated textbooks, electronic publications and illegal journals that may have negative influence on the youth.

Among the banned games are: "&lt;a href="w%3AManhunt%20%28video%20game%29"&gt;Manhunt&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="w%3AFIFA%20Series"&gt;FIFA 2005&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Sims%202"&gt;The Sims 2&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="w%3ABattlefield%20Vietnam"&gt;Battlefield Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;", "Painkiller: Battle out of Hell", and "&lt;a href="w%3AAge%20of%20Mythology"&gt;Age of Mythology: the Titans&lt;/a&gt;".

&lt;a href="w%3ATararua%20Ranges"&gt;Tararua Ranges&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; – In an attempt at a world first twenty &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Short-tailed%20bat"&gt;short-tailed bats&lt;/a&gt; are to be moved by the New Zealand Department of Conservation from the Tararua Ranges to &lt;a href="w%3AKapiti%20Island"&gt;Kapiti Island&lt;/a&gt;. If the transfer to predator-free Kapiti works, it will become the first time that bats have ever been trans-located.

All previous attempts at moving bats have failed due to their natural homing instincts. However scientists with the Department of Conservation, are aiming to overcome this by shifting juveniles. The young bats, which weigh in at only 14 grams each, were born in the week around New Year and were raised at Pukaha Mount Bruce National Wildlife Centre near Eketahuna.

Conservation Minister Chris Carter said that while the trial was risky, it was also worthwhile. "A willingness to push boundaries and try new things is exactly what conservation in New Zealand needs," he said.

<h1>Cuba restores relations with European Union</h1>

&lt;a href="w%3AEurope"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; – The government of &lt;a href="w%3ACuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt; has re-established official contacts with all of the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; countries. The diplomatic relationship with the EU had been limited for more than 18 months.

The EU relationship with Cuba was injured on March-June 2003 after the arrest and conviction of 75 "dissidents" by the Cuban government. In a separate case, three Cubans were executed on foot of a sentence handed down by a civil court, and confirmed on appeal by the Cuban Supreme Court, which found them guilty of hijacking a ferry and endangering the lives of its occupants. Cuba accused the dissidents of collaboration with the &lt;a href="w%3AUS"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; and sabotage against the Cuban &lt;a href="w%3Acommunist"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; system. All 75 "dissadents" appear to have pleaded guilty of receiving illegal payments from US agents in court when confronted with the evidence. 14 of the 75 convicted mercenaries, who the US continues to insist were "dissadents", have since been released on licience. 

Cuba and the EU began to come close again after the efforts of the President of the government of Spain, &lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9%20Luis%20Rodr%C3%ADguez%20Zapatero"&gt;José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero&lt;/a&gt;. At that time, the German Chancellor &lt;a href="w%3AGerhard%20Schr%C3%B6der"&gt;Gerhard Schröder&lt;/a&gt; didn't agree with Zapatero about unfreezing the relationships between Cuba and the EU. Schröder believed Cuba should first show real commitment to improving the human rights conditions on the island. However, on November 25, 2004, the Cuban Chancellor Felipe Pérez Roque announced the re-establishment of official contacts with the government of Spain.

On November 30, 2004, Cuba released four political dissidents: Marcelo López, Margarito Broche, Óscar Espinosa Chepe and Raúl Rivero. The Dutch Presidency of the European Union praised the Cuban decision. Cuba said that the decision was not influenced by the Spanish government.

On December 15, 2004 the Council of the European Union for Latin America committee recommended the suspension of the diplomatic sanctions against Cuba, according to alleged Spanish diplomatic sources.

Finally, on January 10, 2005, the Cuban Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque told journalists:"We can say that from this moment onward Cuba has re-established government-level official contacts with all European Union countries." On January 31, 2005, the EU council of foreign ministers agreed to a suspension of EU sanctions against Cuba. The international &lt;a href="w%3ANon-governmental%20organization"&gt;non-governmental organization&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AReporters%20Without%20Borders"&gt;Reporters Without Borders&lt;/a&gt; protested and sent a &lt;a href="http%3A//www.rsf.org/article.php3%3Fid_article%3D12442"&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt; to the president of the European Commission on February 1, 2005.

The Beslan siege organiser, &lt;a href="w%3AChechnya"&gt;Chechen&lt;/a&gt; rebel &lt;a href="w%3AShamil%20Basayev"&gt;Shamil Basayev&lt;/a&gt;, has spoken for the first time since declaring he was responsible for the hostage situation. The &lt;a href="w%3ABeslan%20school%20hostage%20crisis"&gt;Beslan school siege&lt;/a&gt; last September resulted in 330 deaths, half of which were children. Basayev was also responsible for the Moscow Theatre siege, in which 130 people died after a military assault to free the hostages and overwhelm the terrorists.

A package containing three video CDs with an hour's statement by Basayev was sent to Channel 4 News, four months after they asked an intermediary questions about them man behind the attacks.

In the statement, the rebel leader aimed to justify the siege, claiming the &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; government's aggressive response was unexpected and led to the large number of deaths. He claims that he would and likely will do it again, though he said he appreciated that it would appear cynical. He restated that he is fighting for an end of Russian military offensives in Chechnya.

Georgia – &lt;a href="w%3AZurab%20Zhvania"&gt;Zurab Zhvania&lt;/a&gt;, Prime Minister of &lt;a href="w%3AGeorgia%20%28country%29"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, was found dead of gas poisoning at a friend's home. The China Daily quotes Interior Minister &lt;a href="w%3AVano%20Merabishvili"&gt;Vano Merabishvili&lt;/a&gt;: "This is a tragic accident... It was a gas poisoning."

Zhavani was visiting in the home of Raul Usupov, deputy governor from the Kvemo-Kartli region, when an apparent carbon monoxide leak from a gas space heater overcame and killed both him and his host.

Carbon monoxide poisoning is not unknown in Georgia; 45 deaths by carbon monoxide poisoning are reported by the official Russian Information Agency. Power supplies are not entirely reliable, and central heating systems are not universal, so small portable heaters are common even in the capital.

President &lt;a href="w%3AMikhail%20Saakashvili"&gt;Mikhail Saakashvili&lt;/a&gt; called an emergency cabinet meeting to discuss responding to the death. "(Zhvania's death) is a huge blow for our country and personally for me as a president and as a person," quotes the China Daily, "I have lost my closest friend, my most loyal adviser, my biggest ally."

Once a protegé of &lt;a href="w%3AEduard%20Shevardnadze"&gt;Eduard Shevardnadze&lt;/a&gt;, and widely viewed as his chosen successor, Zhvania chose to join the opposition in supporting Saakashvili. He has been viewed as a moderating influence on Saakashvili, who appointed Mr. Zhvania after taking office one year ago.

Zhavania joined Georgia's Green Party in the 1980s. He was chair of Georgia's Parliament from 1995-2001.

"He played an important role in helping Georgia meet its aspirations for greater peace, prosperity and euro-Atlantic integration," &lt;a href="w%3ANATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; chief &lt;a href="w%3AJaap%20de%20Hoop%20Scheffer"&gt;Jaap de Hoop Scheffer&lt;/a&gt; said in his expression of condolences.

Despite assurances from the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Commission"&gt;European Commissioner for the Internal Market&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACharlie%20McCreevy"&gt;Charles McCreevy&lt;/a&gt; that the Council would adopt its controversial Common Position text covering &lt;a href="w%3ASoftware%20Patents"&gt;Software Patents&lt;/a&gt;, members voted to restart the entire process with a new directive.

&lt;a href="w%3AMember%20of%20the%20European%20Parliament"&gt;MEP&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMichel%20Rocard"&gt;Michel Rocard&lt;/a&gt; noted several "inelegancies" by the Commission in his speech against the directive, such as not taking into account any of the Parliament's substantive amendments in its recommendation to the Council. He also took the Dutch and German governments to task for ignoring their respective parliaments. The Irish Presidency's sponsorship by &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; was also criticised, as were the attempted ratifications at fishery Council meetings.

There was also confusion over the actual effects of the proposed directive with industry players confirming that the Council text allowed pure software patents, while the Commission claimed it would not.

"In the debate, broad agreement prevailed over the fact that the current proposal was counter-productive and far from a good basis for a decision," said &lt;a href="w%3AMEPs%20for%20Italy%202004-2009"&gt;Italian MEP&lt;/a&gt; Monica Frassoni.

The computer-implemented inventions directive was voted down by members of European Parliament (MEP) in the legal affairs committee. 19 MEPs voted in favour of re-starting negotiations, 2 against with one abstention.

NEW YORK,United States – 

A report released by the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; last week said that there is no &lt;a href="w%3Agenocide"&gt;genocide&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASudan"&gt;Sudan's&lt;/a&gt; western region of &lt;a href="w%3ADarfur"&gt;Darfur&lt;/a&gt;. 

The report also says that the Sudanese government and its Arab militias had committed crimes against humanity by destroying villages and torturing, killing and raping civilians. According to the report, there is credible evidence that local rebel groups, including the &lt;a href="w%3ASudanese%20Liberation%20Army"&gt;Sudanese Liberation Army&lt;/a&gt;, are responsible for serious violations of international law which may amount to war crimes.

The government of the United States and aid agencies say genocide is been committed in Sudan.

<h1>UN IIC report faults former &quot;Oil-for-Food&quot; director</h1>
, 
Former &lt;a href="w%3AChairman%20of%20the%20Federal%20Reserve"&gt;U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Volcker"&gt;Paul Volcker&lt;/a&gt; delivered a preliminary report of the investigation into the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nation's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AOil%20for%20Food%20program"&gt;Oil-for-Food program&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href="w%3ASaddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt;, which is sharply critical of the procurement process used and former program director &lt;a href="w%3ABenon%20Sevan"&gt;Benon Sevan&lt;/a&gt;.

Volker heads the &lt;a href="w%3AOil%20for%20Food%20program%23UN%20investigation"&gt;Independent Inquiry Committee&lt;/a&gt;, an investigation requested by &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Secretary-General"&gt;UN Secretary-General&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AKofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt; in June, 2004.

Annan has already responded to the report, ordering disciplinary action for Sevan and other UN officials of the former program.

Volker expects the report will go some ways to responding to critics of the UN program. "I think it's important to find out the extent those attacks are justified," he is quoted as saying. "There are obviously problems in the institution and we have identified some of them. But the end of this should be a reformed and stronger U.N., because I believe - and I know the other committee members believe - that the U.N. has an important role to play but it cannot be effective if it is under suspicion all of the time."

Charges that UN officials misused 1.4 billion &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20dollar"&gt;USD&lt;/a&gt; of administrative funds are unfair, Volker said. "We do not find evidence that this was a big slush fund," he said. "The money was carefully budgeted. They didn't spend all of the money they had budgeted. They gave some of it back to Iraq."

The Independent Investigation Committee report faulted the contract procurement process which selected Banque Nationale de Paris, Saybolt Eastern Hemisphere BV, and Lloyd's Register Inspection Limite, saying it did not conform to financial and competitive bidding standards. The choices were "clearly affected by political considerations" according to Volker.

Sevan is particularly faulted for personal financial transactions, including $160,000 over 1999-2003 which his lawyer has stated came from an aunt who has since died.

<h1>Cambodian opposition leader stripped of immunity, flees country</h1>
, 

Sam Rainsy, leader of the opposition party in the &lt;a href="w%3ACambodia"&gt;Cambodian&lt;/a&gt; National Assembly, and two other members of his party, Chea Poch and Cheam Channy, have been stripped of parliamentary immunity. Rainsy has left the country, while Channy has been arrested.

Assembly members are immune to prosecution or arrest for expressing their opinions as part of their parliamentary duties. Armed forces surrounded the Assembly building in Phnom Penh during the vote Thursday, which requires a two-thirds super majority.

Speaking on behalf of the United States, State Department deputy spokesman Adam Ereli called on Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen's government to "allow all citizens to peacefully express their political views without fear of retribution or intimidation."

In &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; 30,000 students demonstrate in 5 big cities against study fees. People think, that paying for information is not socially compatible and gives only privileged people the chance to get in depth information. Germans demand a broad and free education for every citizen of the world. In the next weeks, students will fight for justice and show solidarity with the Countries of the Federal Republic, which want to already demand study fees in the next term.

At this time, the first education in Germany is free, but the Federation decided days ago, that the states of the Federal Republic can create their own financing concepts, because &lt;a href="w%3Ade%3AChristlich%20Demokratische%20Union%20Deutschlands"&gt;CDU&lt;/a&gt; governed states complained against the Federation.

Several German states partly plan to plug budget gaps with the money from the young people willing to give their power for a broadly educated Germany.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;AUSTRALIA&lt;/a&gt; – Australian &lt;a href="w%3AImmigration%20to%20Australia"&gt;immigration&lt;/a&gt; authorities have held a &lt;a href="w%3AMental%20illness"&gt;mentally ill&lt;/a&gt; Australian woman, Cornelia Rau (also known as Anna), against her will for over 10 months, at least two of them spent in high security, where she was reportedly isolated for 18 to 20 hours a day, subjected to 24-hour simulated daylight and deprived adequate legal or medical aid.

Volunteer &lt;a href="w%3AAdvocacy"&gt;advocates'&lt;/a&gt; requests for ministerial intervention, prompted by her clear distress and aberrant behaviour, went unanswered for seven weeks, while Ms Rau was held at South Australian Baxter &lt;a href="w%3AMandatory%20detention%20in%20Australia"&gt;Immigration Detention&lt;/a&gt; Center.

<h4>Isolation and sleep deprivation</h4>

Several days ago, &lt;a href="w%3ARefugee"&gt;refugee&lt;/a&gt; advocate &lt;a href="http%3A//vic.greens.org.au/content/elections/2004-federal-election/senate/pamela-curr-biography"&gt;Pamela Curr&lt;/a&gt; had visited and spoken with the woman, then unidentified and known only as Anna, and said "She exhibits &lt;a href="w%3APsychosis"&gt;psychotic&lt;/a&gt; symptoms, screaming and talking to herself at times, and screams in terror often for long periods especially when locked in the cell.

"Such is her terror of being put back into this cell that it takes six guards in full &lt;a href="w%3ARiot%20control"&gt;riot gear&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3AGrapple"&gt;manhandle&lt;/a&gt; her back into the room and close the heavy door."

"We have reports from witnesses that the guards are enjoying this aspect of Anna's behaviour," said refugee advocacy group &lt;a href="http%3A//chilout.org"&gt;ChilOut.org&lt;/a&gt; at around the same time. &lt;a href="http%3A//pbahq.smartcampaigns.com/node/679"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

One &lt;a href="http%3A//www.safecom.org.au/baxter.htm"&gt;message&lt;/a&gt; from a fellow detainee posted on the refugee advocate website &lt;a href="http%3A//safecom.org"&gt;safecom.org&lt;/a&gt; on January 24, said Ms Rau appeared to be "very, very sick".

"She takes her clothes off and wanders around in this all-male compound," the account read. "She screams obscenities, throws food at other detainees and smashes things."

According to Ms Curr, Ms Rau was being held in &lt;a href="w%3ASolitary%20confinement"&gt;isolation&lt;/a&gt; in Baxter's dedicated 'Red One' isolation block for 18 to 20 hours a day, and in &lt;a href="w%3ASleep%20deprivation"&gt;daylight conditions for 24 hours a day&lt;/a&gt;, a practice which has in the past been criticised because of use of isolation and sleep deprivation in &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Immigration%20and%20Multicultural%20and%20Indigenous%20Affairs"&gt;Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA)&lt;/a&gt; facilities to coerce cooperation from inmates &lt;a href="http%3A//www.hreoc.gov.au/media_releases/2002/71_02.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

The Migration Act prevents anyone from acting on behalf of a detainee unless the detainee requests this in writing, and so chances of any improvement in Ms Rau's condition or welfare were slim. The Act makes no provision for cases such as this, where the detainee is no longer competent to make such a request. Mental ill health is a reported by-product of the DIMIA system of indefinite detention &lt;a href="http%3A//www.hreoc.gov.au/media_releases/2002/71_02.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

<h4>Refugee concern prompted search for identity</h4>

Fellow detainees became concerned for Ms Rau's welfare when immigration authorities failed to remedy her mental ill health, and were unable to identify her. Refugee advocates in contact with detainees then led a campaign to identify the woman, resulting in her family recognising her description.

Thirty-nine year old &lt;a href="w%3AQantas"&gt;Qantas&lt;/a&gt; flight attendant Cornelia Rau had in fact been listed as a &lt;a href="w%3AMissing%20Person"&gt;missing person&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales (NSW)&lt;/a&gt; police since August of last year, after disappearing in March. A NSW police effort to find her in November failed to identify that she was being held by Australia's &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Immigration%20and%20Multicultural%20and%20Indigenous%20Affairs"&gt;Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs&lt;/a&gt;, meanwhile DIMIA was stumped as to the identity of their German-speaking prisoner.

The Immigration Department said it had gone to great lengths to identify of Ms Rau, contacting the police missing persons registry in Queensland, and several foreign governments, but not NSW police missing persons. "All the information provided by the woman led the department to believe she was an unlawful non-citizen. At no time did she state she was a permanent (Australian) &lt;a href="w%3ACitizenship"&gt;citizen&lt;/a&gt;."

<h4>Papers, please</h4>

Aborigines at Coen in Far North &lt;a href="w%3AQueensland"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt; had found Cornelia in a disturbed state on March 31 last year, and become concerned, taking her to police for her own safety. The Queensland Police failed to &lt;a href="w%3AIdentity%20document"&gt;identify&lt;/a&gt; her and assumed she was an illegal immigrant since she spoke &lt;a href="w%3AGerman%20language"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of &lt;a href="w%3APsychiatric%20hospital"&gt;hospitalising&lt;/a&gt; Ms Rau, they handed her over to immigration officials, on April 5.

According to Ms Curr, when she spoke to Ms Rau at Baxter last month, "Her English was fine. She told me then she really wasn't in touch with reality, but there was a moment of clarity when she just wanted to get out of Baxter. I spoke to a detainee two days ago and he said her &lt;a href="w%3AEnglish%20language"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; was so good he thought she was an &lt;a href="w%3AAussie"&gt;Aussie&lt;/a&gt; girl." 

Ms Rau had arrived in Australia at the age of 18 months from &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;. Cornelia's sister Chris says, "The two groups who were kind to Cornelia in all this time were the two most downtrodden groups in society -- the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Aborigine"&gt;Aboriginal people&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ACairns%2C%20Queensland"&gt;Cairns&lt;/a&gt; and the refugees in Baxter. There's an irony in that".

<h4>Mental health in indefinite, high security detention</h4>

The &lt;a href="w%3AGovernment%20of%20Australia"&gt;Australian Federal Government&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AHuman%20Rights%20and%20Equal%20Opportunity%20Commission"&gt;Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC)&lt;/a&gt;'s Immigration Detention Centre Guidelines &lt;a href="http%3A//www.hreoc.gov.au/pdf/human_rights/asylum_seekers/idc_guidelines.pdf"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; state that, "Immigration detainees who are found to be severely mentally ill should be transferred to an appropriate facility as soon as possible."

The Immigration Department said she had been under mental supervision at all times. "A number of medical assessments were conducted by &lt;a href="w%3AHealth%20profession"&gt;healthcare professionals&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="w%3APhysician"&gt;doctors&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APsychiatry"&gt;psychiatrists&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APsychologist"&gt;psychologists&lt;/a&gt;," a departmental spokesperson said. 

Findings by a number of independent inquiries have shown that long term, indefinite detention, which is the norm within the Australian immigration system, has the unfortunate side effect of inducing mental health problems in individuals who were otherwise healthy on entering the system, and refugee advocates have pointed to this issue previously in cases involving non-citizens.

Countless human rights violations have been documented within DIMIA's system by the Federal Government's own policing body, HREOC, which has complained repeatedly for years that its recommendations are not being met. Principally, that the system of &lt;a href="w%3AMandatory%20detention%20in%20Australia"&gt;mandatory detention&lt;/a&gt; itself is an infringement of &lt;a href="w%3AHuman%20Rights"&gt;human rights&lt;/a&gt; and should be abolished, and that children (of whom there are currently 87 in detention &lt;a href="http%3A//chilout.org/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) should not be held in custody.

HREOC criticises the general lack of adequate mental health services, the use of isolation detention for behaviour management, detainees' restricted access to legal assistance and lack of information about the application process, their limited access to general information and contact with the outside world, including relatives, and the effects of such long term detention on the detainees, specifically on their mental health. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.hreoc.gov.au/media_releases/2002/71_02.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Past publicised cases have shown detainees denied any legal avenues they do not explicitly ask for using correct legal/bureaucratic terminology &lt;a href="http%3A//www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/04/01/1080544608721.html%3Foneclick%3Dtrue"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; failure to provide adequate medical assistance; and habitual isolation of troublesome detainees instead of meeting of their grievances.

HREOC has the ability to make recommendations only, and it is up to the Government to enforce, or not enforce them.

"It's pretty dangerous if you have &lt;a href="w%3AAlzheimer%27s%20disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt; or you speak a &lt;a href="w%3ASecond%20language"&gt;second language&lt;/a&gt; right now," according to &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Labor&lt;/a&gt; immigration spokesperson, Laurie Ferguson. Mr Ferguson believed Queensland Police and the Federal Government had questions to answer, and that there should be an Inquiry.

<h4>Cost</h4>

As well as the personal cost to Cornelia Rau and her family and friends, each day a person spends in immigration detention costs the Department between $111 to $725 &lt;a href="http%3A//www.ruralaustraliansforrefugees.org/template.php3%3Farea%3Dfacts%26amp%3Bcontent%3Dcosts"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. According to DIMIA, "Government policy is that, where practical, immigration detainees should be billed for the cost of their stay in detention." &lt;a href="http%3A//www.immi.gov.au/budget/budget04/2004-05_imia_pbs_08_dimia_section_4.pdf"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; It is not known whether the Department intends to bill Ms Rau.

<h1>Chandra telescope finds missing baryonic matter</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Chandra%20telescope%20finds%20missing%20baryonic%20matter&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Scientists studying data from the 
&lt;a href="w%3AChandra%20X-ray%20Observatory"&gt;Chandra X-ray telescope&lt;/a&gt; have
found strong evidence for the missing half of ordinary matter
in the universe. Two immense intergalactic clouds confirm the
existence of a cosmic web of hot gas, predicted by computer
simulations, containing &lt;a href="w%3ABaryon"&gt;baryons&lt;/a&gt;, the material making
up visible objects in the &lt;a href="w%3AUniverse"&gt;Universe&lt;/a&gt;.
"An inventory of all the baryons in stars and gas inside and outside
of &lt;a href="w%3AGalaxy"&gt;galaxies&lt;/a&gt; accounts for just over half the baryons that
existed shortly after the Big Bang," Fabrizio Nicastro of the
Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. "Now we have found the
likely hiding place of the missing baryons." Nicastro is lead author
of a paper in the February 3, 2005 issue of 
&lt;a href="w%3ANature%20%28journal%29"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt; describing the recent research.

Various measurements give a good estimate of the mass-density of
baryons - the &lt;a href="w%3ANeutron"&gt;neutrons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AProton"&gt;protons&lt;/a&gt;
that make up the nuclei of atoms and ions - in the
&lt;a href="w%3AUniverse"&gt;Universe&lt;/a&gt; 10 billion years ago. However, sometime
during the last 10 billion years a large fraction of the baryons,
commonly referred to as "ordinary matter" to distinguish them
from &lt;a href="w%3ADark%20matter"&gt;dark matter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ADark%20energy"&gt;dark
energy&lt;/a&gt;, have gone missing.

Using the computer predictions, Nicastro and colleagues
searched specifically for the diffuse system of gas clouds
galaxies and galaxy clusters form within. Evidence of the
clouds had been previously detected around our own galaxy and in
the &lt;a href="w%3ALocal%20Group"&gt;Local Group&lt;/a&gt;, but the temperature range (a few
hundred thousand to a million degrees Celsius) and low density
have prevented detection outside the immediate neighborhood of
galaxies and the reliable estimation of baryon density for the
entire universe.

The clouds were detected using Chandra observations when the
galaxy Mkn 421 brightened in &lt;a href="w%3AX-ray%20astronomy"&gt;X-ray&lt;/a&gt;
emissions. The X-ray spectral data showed two hot gas clouds,
150 million and 370 million &lt;a href="w%3ALight%20year"&gt;light years&lt;/a&gt; distant, absorbing the
X-rays from Mkn 421. The data shows the presence of carbon,
nitrogen, oxygen, and neon present in the clouds. Combined with
other data the research team determined the thickness and mass of
the clouds.

Assuming that the size and distribution of the clouds are
representative, Nicastro and colleagues made the first reliable
estimate of average density of baryons in such clouds throughout
the Universe, finding it consistent with the mass density of the
missing baryons.

Mkn 421 was observed three times with Chandra's Low-Energy
Transmission Grating (LETG), twice in conjunction with the High
Resolution Camera (May 2000 and July 2003) and once with the
Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (October 2002). The distance to
Mkn 421 is 400 million light years.

&lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; With more than two-thirds of the 3.3 million votes counted in the &lt;a href="w%3AIraqi%20legislative%20election%2C%202005"&gt;Iraqi legislative election&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Iraqi%20Alliance"&gt;United Iraqi Alliance&lt;/a&gt; has a considerable lead over interim &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraqi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20Prime%20Ministers%20of%20Iraq"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AIyad%20Allawi"&gt;Iyad Allawi's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AIraqi%20List"&gt;Iraqi List&lt;/a&gt; which trails with approximately 17% of the current tally.

The election commission (&lt;a href="http%3A//www.ieciraq.org/english.html"&gt;IECI&lt;/a&gt;) did not have firm figures for how many people voted, but estimates approximately 8 million Iraqis participated in the historic poll. The results so far do not include the northern provinces which are largely &lt;a href="w%3ASunni"&gt;Sunni&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AKurdish"&gt;Kurdish&lt;/a&gt; strongholds.

The most recent returns were from the &lt;a href="w%3AProvinces%20of%20Iraq"&gt;provinces&lt;/a&gt; of Babylon, Basra, Karbala, Maysan, Muthanna, Najaf, Qadissiyah, Zi Qar and Wassit, and from Baghdad.

&lt;a href="w%3AJalal%20Talabani"&gt;Jalal Talabani&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the northern Kurdish &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Patriotic%20Alliance%20of%20Kurdistan"&gt;political bloc&lt;/a&gt;, has called to be nominated as the new Prime Minister or President, a proposal which may indicate the suspected deal between the &lt;a href="w%3AShi%27a%20Islam"&gt;Shia&lt;/a&gt; and the Kurds may in fact be in place - a situation sure to inflame the former ruling minority &lt;a href="w%3ASunni%20Islam"&gt;Sunnis&lt;/a&gt;.

Final results are expected to be announced on Tuesday, February 8.

The today unveiled it's plans for a new iMP player with which people in the will be able to any BBC tv or radio programme for a week after it has been broadcast in the UK. These downloads will have a limited life, becoming inactive a week after the show has been shown live in the UK. The BBC are justifying their proposed decision to restrict the use of the new player to those using a UK on the basis that it is only UK citizens who pay the . In the UK it is illegal to use a television to receive UK broadcasts without a television licence, but no such restrictions are in place for using either a radio or a computer. It is the money from the licence fee that funds the BBC. 

At the moment it is possible to listen to live BBC radio, and to some old programmes for a week, as well as some news output, including , by through the internet, and this service is available in every part of the world. At the moment there are few sites whose availability is restricted depending on where one is geographically located. Some countries such as Iran and China restrict what the users in it's country can view on the internet, but till now almost all of the material that has been released has been made available all over the world. 

The iMP is still not ready, and while the BBC are hoping to release it this year they are refusing to make any promises. Clearly having the technology in place to ensure that the downloads deactivate at a given moment, and that people outside the UK cannot access these downloads, either directly through the internet, or indirectly through , is going to take a little while yet.

The major aim of the repurchase is to ensure existing shareholders do not have their stakes in the company diluted over the coming years as a result the company's stock compensation program. The purchase of stock will be done over the next two years at manager's discretion at prevailing prices as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements. 

The company also announced a quarterly dividend of 50 cents per share which is to be payable on March 1, 2005, to stockholders of record at the close of business Feb. 15, 2005.

<h1>Grey Wolves are Still Protected by the Endangered Species Act</h1>
, 

This week, a court case has decided to maintain the grey wolf's endangered species protection status.

Defenders of Wildlife filed a suit after March 18, 2003, when the Fish and Wildlife Service decided to downlist the wolf from "endangered" status to "threatened" status. Such a move would have dramatically weakened the legal protection of the animal, and jeopardised it's recovery, according to wildlife campaigners.

Rodger Schlickeisen, Defenders of Wildlife's President, commented:

The Government's plans to reclassify the grey wolf were criticized as 'not based on science or the law' by the US District Court ruling. The Court ruled today that it was unlawful for the Administration to weaken legal protections for the grey wolf in large areas of its historic range based on recovery success in a just a few core areas like the Northern Rockies and Great Lakes. This ruling calls into question other Bush Administration wolf proposals, one of which is their attempt to remove protections entirely for the wolves in the Northeastern United States.

Schlickeisen also stated:

&lt;a href="w%3ABrasilia"&gt;BRASILIA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; – The Cuban Minister of Foreign Relations Felipe Peréz Roque visited Brazil on February 2-3. He met Brazilian President &lt;a href="w%3ALuiz%20In%C3%A1cio%20Lula%20da%20Silva"&gt;Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva&lt;/a&gt; and the Brazilian Minister of Foreign Relations &lt;a href="w%3ACelso%20Amorim"&gt;Celso Amorim&lt;/a&gt;.

According to the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.mre.gov.br/portugues/imprensa/nota_detalhe.asp%3FID_RELEASE%3D2803"&gt;Brazilian Ministry of External Relations website&lt;/a&gt;, the objective of the visit was to intensify the dialogue and to fortify the cooperation between Brazil and Cuba, giving attention to the development of high level agreements between the governments.

On February 2, the Cuban minister was received by the Brazilian Senate President &lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9%20Sarney"&gt;José Sarney&lt;/a&gt;, the President of the Chamber of Deputies &lt;a href="w%3AJo%C3%A3o%20Paulo%20Cunha"&gt;João Paulo Cunha&lt;/a&gt; and by the Chief of Staff &lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9%20Dirceu"&gt;José Dirceu&lt;/a&gt;.

On February 3, Roque met Lula da Silva and Amorim. During the meeting, he mentioned that he was carrying a personal message from the Cuban President &lt;a href="Fidel%20Castro"&gt;Fidel Castro&lt;/a&gt; to Lula da Silva. "We express to Lula Cuba's affection for the project of integration of Latin America," he added.

Roque also said that Cuba supports the candidacy of Brazil for the UN Security Council: "We hold the same position as Brazil in favor of a multipolar world, a world in which the UN's role and authority are strengthened, concurrently with a profound reform and democratization of the United Nations."

Roque and Amorim discussed the situation in &lt;a href="w%3AHaiti"&gt;Haiti&lt;/a&gt;. He reiterated that Cuba keeps a contrary position to the form as Haitian president &lt;a href="w%3AJean%20Bertrand%20Aristide"&gt;Jean Bertrand Aristide&lt;/a&gt; left power.

During the visit, the Cuban Minister of Foreign Relations, Felipe Peréz Roque, also met parents of Brazilian students studying in &lt;a href="w%3AHavana"&gt;Havana&lt;/a&gt;, delegates from the &lt;a href="w%3ALandless%20Workers%27%20Movement"&gt;Landless Workers Movement (MST)&lt;/a&gt;, delegates from labour unions and delegates from student organizations which expressed solidarity to the cause of the Cuban Revolution. 

<h2>Brazil-Cuba relationship</h2>
Brazilian diplomatic relations with &lt;a href="w%3ACuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt; were suspended in 1964, and reestablished in 1986. Bilateral relations between Brazil and Cuba have strengthened since then, particularly in the past few years. The Brazilian government advocates the end of the US &lt;a href="w%3Aembargo"&gt;embargo&lt;/a&gt; against Cuba. The Brazilian government says the unilateral application of economic and commercial sanctions for political purposes violates the principles of international law. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.mre.gov.br/ingles/politica_externa/relacoes/america_central/cuba.asp"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Cuba purchased 480 buses from Brazil for collective transportation in Havana and between provinces in 2000. The Brazilian National Bank for Economic and Social Development (BNDES) participates in the funding of an project aimed at the modernization of the Cuban sugar industry. 

The President of Cuba, &lt;a href="w%3AFidel%20Castro"&gt;Fidel Castro&lt;/a&gt;, has visited Brazil several times, most recently in September 1998, June 1999, September 2001, and January 2003.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; – 
&lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Gosling"&gt;James Gosling&lt;/a&gt;, the creator of the &lt;a href="w%3AJava%20programming%20language"&gt;Java programming language&lt;/a&gt;, said last week that he believes &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; is wrong in its decision to support &lt;a href="w%3AC%20programming%20language"&gt;C&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AC%20Plus%20Plus"&gt;C++&lt;/a&gt; programming languages in the common language runtime in &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20.NET"&gt;Microsoft .NET&lt;/a&gt;. According to him, this decision may lead to severe security flaws in .NET. Gosling is currently in Australia, giving talks and visiting friends.

According to Gosling, the problem lies with the programming languages and some of their characteristics: “C++ allowed you to do arbitrary casting, arbitrary adding of images and pointers, and converting them back and forth between pointers in a very, very unstructured way." 

The Java language was developed due to limitations of C++. Gosling began using C++ for the former &lt;a href="w%3ASun%20Microsystems"&gt;Sun Microsystems&lt;/a&gt;'s star-seven project. At that time Gosling concluded C++ was inadequate and created the Oak language. The Oak language would become the language known today as Java. The former star-seven project shares its defining characteristics with networked software applications today: safety and portability.

Gosling continues: "If you look at the security model in Java and the reliability model, and a lot of things in the exception handling, they depend really critically on the fact that there is some integrity to the properties of objects. So if somebody gives you an object and says 'This is an image', then it is an image. It's not like a pointer to a stream, where it just casts an image."

Charles Sterling, a Microsoft developer and product manager of the .NET framework, didn’t entirely disagree with Gosling’s thoughts. But he said that .NET defines different types of code. And there is the code which is managed by the .NET framework. All new Microsoft languages, such as &lt;a href="w%3AC%20Sharp%20programming%20language"&gt;C#&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AVisual%20Basic"&gt;Visual Basic.NET&lt;/a&gt;, produce only code managed by the .NET framework, so they are safe.

A key idea that has not shown up in Gosling's talk is that Java itself allows a very similar process to occur. Java's JNI (Java Native Interface) allows the integration of the same unsafe code that prompted Gosling's central thesis.

However, Gosling says languages like C and C++ can still produce unsafe code which would not follow the rules of safety of .NET. This sort of code, usually found in old software applications, requires additional .NET permissions to execute. Sterling says it is up to developers to decide whether or not to use unsafe code in their .NET applications.

A collaboratively-developed &lt;a href="w%3AOperating%20system%20kernel"&gt;operating system kernel&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href="w%3AGNU%20Hurd"&gt;GNU Hurd&lt;/a&gt; has been made bootable using the &lt;a href="w%3AL4%20microkernel%20family"&gt;L4 microkernel&lt;/a&gt;, which provides room for significant speed improvements over an existing implementation using the &lt;a href="w%3AMach%20kernel"&gt;Mach&lt;/a&gt; microkernel. The newer architecture also has a more lively developer community.

Developer &lt;a href="http%3A//savannah.gnu.org/users/marcus"&gt;Marcus Brinkmann&lt;/a&gt; made the historic step and finished the process initialization code, which enabled him to execute the first software on Hurd-L4. In a message to the &lt;a href="http%3A//lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/l4-hurd/"&gt;L4 port of GNU Hurd&lt;/a&gt; mailing list, Brinkmann wrote, "We can now easily explore and develop the system in any way we want. The dinner is prepared!". &lt;a href="http%3A//lists.gnu.org/archive/html/l4-hurd/2005-01/msg00135.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; However, the kernel's current feature set is very limited. "With my glibc port, I can already build simple applications, but most won't run because they need a filesystem or other gimmicks (like, uhm, fork and exec), and I only have stubs (dummy functions which always return an error) for that now," he added in a later posting. &lt;a href="http%3A//lists.gnu.org/archive/html/l4-hurd/2005-02/msg00011.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;a href="w%3AKernel%20%28computer%20science%29%23Monolithic%20kernels%20vs.%20microkernels"&gt;Compared&lt;/a&gt; with Linux and &lt;a href="w%3ABSD"&gt;BSD&lt;/a&gt; Unix's &lt;a href="w%3AKernel%20%28computer%20science%29%23Monolithic%20kernels"&gt;monolithic kernel&lt;/a&gt; architecture, a &lt;a href="w%3AKernel%20%28computer%20science%29%23Microkernels"&gt;microkernel&lt;/a&gt; based operating system provides developers greater modularity and isolation from hardware, a big win with L4 already being available for a large number of hardware varieties.

There is a cost in speed for such abstraction, and this cost was higher on Mach, at around 15%, compared with only around 5% on L4 and it's predecessor L3, both developed by Dr. Jochen Liedtke. &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L4_microkernel_family"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The greater modularity and abstraction of a microkernel approach means that the microkernel itself does not need constant modification as is seen in the Linux &lt;a href="w%3Akernel"&gt;kernel&lt;/a&gt; today, since it provides only the very minimum of services, and does so very carefully. Thus, the fact that L4 was developed in 1996 is seen as exemplifying this stability -- rather than showing its age -- since few, if any, improvements in approach have been imagined in the meantime.

However, the &lt;a href="w%3AMach%20kernel"&gt;Mach kernel&lt;/a&gt; first developed ten years earlier at &lt;a href="w%3ACarnegie%20Mellon%20University"&gt;Carnegie Mellon University&lt;/a&gt; is seen as a flawed first implementation, with the lessons learned being implemented in microkernels like L4, known as second-generation microkernels.

The GNU Hurd forms the base of the &lt;a href="w%3AGNU"&gt;GNU&lt;/a&gt; operating system, much of which has been widely adopted by users of other &lt;a href="w%3AUnix"&gt;Unix&lt;/a&gt;-like operating systems, including Linux. The GNU Project has been developing the Hurd since 1983. In 1990, the GNU Project decided to use the Mach kernel, rather than writing their own. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.gnu.org/software/hurd/history.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The Hurd is released as free software under the &lt;a href="w%3AGPL"&gt;GNU General Public License (GPL)&lt;/a&gt;.

The Hurd kernel is an experiment which aims to surpass existing Unix kernels in functionality, security, and stability, while remaining largely compatible with them. It currently runs on Intel &lt;a href="w%3AIA32"&gt;IA32&lt;/a&gt; machines. According to the GNU Hurd project, "The Hurd should, and probably will, be ported to other hardware architectures or other microkernels in the future" &lt;a href="http%3A//www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

`Hurd' stands for `Hird of Unix-Replacing Daemons'. And, then, `Hird' stands for `Hurd of Interfaces Representing Depth' - perhaps the first software to be named by a pair of mutually recursive acronyms.

A limited port of Linux already runs on L4, known as L4Linux.

This allegation came one day after the former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Volcker"&gt;Paul Volcker&lt;/a&gt; delivered a preliminary report of the investigation into the United Nation's &lt;a href="w%3AOil-for-Food"&gt;Oil-for-Food&lt;/a&gt; program with &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; under Saddam Hussein. Sumaidaie says he has serious doubts about the role of the former UN &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Secretary-General"&gt;secretary-general&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABoutros%20Boutros-Ghali"&gt;Boutros Boutros-Ghali&lt;/a&gt; although there is no charge against him in the report.

In an interview with &lt;a href="w%3AVoice%20of%20America"&gt;Voice of America&lt;/a&gt; reporter Peter Heinlein, Sumaidaie &lt;a href="http%3A//author.voanews.com/english/figleaf/ramfilegenerate.cfm%3Ffilepath%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252F128%252E11%252E143%252E114%252Fmediaassets%252Fenglish%252F2005%255F02%252FAudio%252Frm%252FHeinleinUN%252DAnnan%252DOil%252DFor%252DFood4UpdateFeb05%252Erm"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: "In the early days, the secretariat bent over backwards to please the Saddam regime. At that time it was Boutros Boutros-Ghali who was the Secretary-General. And the report asserts that he tried to please the Saddam government by accommodating its requests which laid the basis for most things that went wrong later... What's clear to me is that Saddam and his regime were able to manipulate things in such a way as to get what they wanted out of this program."

In a recent interview with the New York Times, Sumaidaie said the inquiry's investigators were ignorant of the UN system and that their allegations were silly.

After being questioned by journalists, the current UN secretary-general &lt;a href="w%3AKofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt; said: "Each Secretary-General has to do things his way and in accordance with the circumstances that he finds himself in. I think Mr. Boutros-Ghali has indicated in the report, the environment and the circumstances in which he was taking those decisions and I don't want to second-guess him."

On Friday, Annan said there were some hard knocks in the report and said he would take action promptly: "We do not want this shadow to hang over the UN, so we want to get to the bottom of it."

Doris Ling-Cohan, a New York state &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Supreme%20Court"&gt;Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; justice, said New York’s state constitution guarantees lesbian and gay people equal access to marriage rights that are violated when same-sex couples are not allowed to marry.

"This is a historic ruling that delivers the state Constitution's promise of equality to all New Yorkers," Susan Sommer, Supervising Attorney at &lt;a href="w%3ALambda%20Legal%20Defense%20Fund"&gt;Lambda Legal Defense Fund&lt;/a&gt;, said in a statement to reporters.

In the New York State justice system, the Supreme Court is &lt;a href="w%3ATrial%20court"&gt;court&lt;/a&gt; in which cases originate, and is not the highest court. Decisions from the Supreme Court may, with reason, be appealed to the Appellate Division, and possibly beyond that to the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Court%20of%20Appeals"&gt;Court of Appeals&lt;/a&gt;, the highest court in the New York State justice system.

Justice Ling-Cohan ordered the New York City Clerk's office to start issuing marriage licences to same-sex couple within 30 days. An appeal is expected.

On Saturday &lt;a href="NATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghan&lt;/a&gt; troops located the wreckage of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKam%20Air"&gt;Kam Air&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20737"&gt;Boeing 737&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; missing since Thursday.

Afghan interior ministry spokesman Latfullah Mashal announced the discovery. "The debris of the plane was found around 25 kilometers east of &lt;a href="Kabul"&gt;Kabul&lt;/a&gt; in a mountainous area called Band-e Ghazi."

The jet had been enroute to Kabul from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHerat"&gt;Herat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; when it was diverted due to heavy snow. The crew then sought clearance to land across the border in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APeshawar"&gt;Peshawar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; before it lost contact with air control. 104 persons are reported to have been aboard, including 8 crew members; there are no signs of survivors reported.

The weather conditions have hampered search and rescue efforts. NATO-operated helicopters located the crash site. Afghan police and units from Afghanistan's foreign peacekeeping force are investigating the scene of the crash, according to Mr. Mashal.

&lt;a href="w%3ALondon%2C%20UK"&gt;London, UK&lt;/a&gt; – The quarterly &lt;a href="w%3AG7"&gt;G7&lt;/a&gt; Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors' meeting at Lancaster House concluded on February 5, 2005, with the G7 failing to agree on a plan to reduce debt in developing countries. According to the Los Angeles Times, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown announced that he believes, "this summit will be remembered as the summit for 100% debt relief" for the &lt;a href="http%3A//web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTDEBTDEPT/0%2C%2CcontentMDK%3A20260049~menuPK%3A528655~pagePK%3A64166689~piPK%3A64166646~theSitePK%3A469043%2C00.html"&gt;27 countries&lt;/a&gt; involved in the Enhanced &lt;a href="w%3AHIPC"&gt;HIPC&lt;/a&gt; Initiative. Ministers from other G7 countries disagreed. Brown's so-called International Financial Facility proposal, or IFF, "would not work for the U.S," Undersecretary of the U.S. Treasury John Taylor said to the Los Angeles Times.

The joint statement issued by the ministers in the wake of the conference stated that, "We are agreed on a case-by-case analysis of HIPC countries, based on our willingness to provide as much as 100 per cent multilateral debt relief." The ministers did not cite a figure for the minimum amount of debt relief that would be provided.

The conference was preceded by a demonstration in Trafalgar Square on the theme of "Make Poverty History." Nelson Mandela spoke at the demonstration, attended by an estimated 20,000 people, according to World Development Movement, an organization involved in the planning of the event. Chancellor Brown invited Mandela to address the G7 on February 4, 2005, which he did in a "fireside chat," according to Larry Elliott of The Guardian.

The G7, or 'Group of Seven,' is a coalition of seven major industrial democracies: the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United States, and Canada. They hold quarterly meetings to discuss financial matters.

Jamaica – 
The celebrations to mark the 60th birthday of , the musician who died of cancer in 1981, have been marked by controversy. Since his death these festivities have always taken place in Jamaica, but this year they are taking place in Ethiopia, and particularly in the town of , which is where the former Ethiopian Emperor and God gave land to the Rastafarians to settle on nearly 40 years ago.

The controversy was sparked last month by Bob's wife comments that she wanted his body to be reburied in Ethiopia. Such was the wave of disapproval generated that she quickly backed away from her original statement, but the question as to where his remains should lie is now being hotly debated both in Jamaica and the rest of the world.

As a Rastafarian Bob Marley's spiritual home was in Africa, and specifically in Ethiopia. Yet he only visited the country once, and according to those who want his remains to stay in Jamaica, he was entirely a product of Jamaican culture.

ISCUANDÉ, Colombia – The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia-&lt;a href="w%3AFARC"&gt;FARC&lt;/a&gt; attacked Colombian navy soldiers at the city of &lt;a href="w%3AIscuand%C3%A9"&gt;Iscuandé&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANari%C3%B1o"&gt;Nariño&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AColombia"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;. 16 soldiers from the navy died in the attack and 25 were injured. 

The attack started at 02:40 and finished at 05:20 yesterday February 1st. This was one of the most severe attacks made by the FARC in the last few years.

The navy soldier John Jaider Foronda described the attack to the Colombian Caracol Radio:"I was sleeping. It was 02:30 when we heard the cylinder exploding. It sounded like a bomb. It was at the house of my lieutenant. I got pieces of grenade in my leg and arm." &lt;a href="http%3A//www.caracol.com.co/noticias/au142570.asp"&gt;♡❤♡audio♡❤♡&lt;/a&gt;.

AUSTRALIA – Australian Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; has announced an Inquiry into the "very regrettable incident" of a mentally ill Australian woman being detained for months and allegedly maltreated by the country's own Immigration Department.

The woman, Cornelia Rau, still insisted she was German Anna Schmidt, according to her sister Christine yesterday. "I think it will take a long time for her to stabilise," she said. "At the moment she doesn't accept that she is Cornelia and she doesn't want to see us."

"She is still insisting her name is Anna Schmidt and that her passport is in Baxter and that she wants to return to Germany."

Refugee advocate Pamela Curr claims Ms Rau was held in isolation for 18 to 20 hours a day in Baxter's 'Red One' isolation facility, where she was allegedly kept in simulated daylight for 24 hours a day.

Her family had only discovered her whereabouts through a refugee-initiated effort to identify the woman, authorities having failed to connect the unidentified detainee with her missing person file, held by New South Wales Police since August last year.

After her family recognised media reports of her on Thursday, and contacted the police, her photo was emailed to the Baxter compound and her identity confirmed.

The schizophrenic woman had spent six months in a &lt;a href="w%3AQueensland"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt; prison, according to Channel Nine News, as well as at least two months in immigration detention, according to various sources. Earlier reports had her being handed over to immigration authorities over 10 months ago, with only five days spent in custody with Queensland Police.

Ms Rau is presently recuperating in hospital.

A United Nations report has shown that sports footwear companies are making progress towards ending the use of sweatshops and are implementing more worker-friendly codes of practice than clothing companies and retailers.

The study, published by the International Labour Organisation, suggests that consumer pressure is behind the changes. As a result of consumer's concerns, footwear companies have been diverting financial and human resources towards developing and implementing better codes of conduct for suppliers. Large teams have been established within companies to work toward the goal of better conditions for factory workers.

The study, based upon interviews with hundreds of managers, activists, government officials, factory workers and worker representatives and visits to companies all over the world, goes on to suggest that workers should be given more powers to oversee conditions in their places of work.

Clothing companies have been failing to make such good progress due the large number of constantly-changing suppliers they use, with the ILO study describing progress as "spotty." A major retailer may have a supply base of over 5,000 different companies, making it more difficult to establish stronger, more effective links with supply companies. They have also assigned less manpower to the task of compliance with codes of practice.

In some areas of the retail industry, there has been almost no compliance with codes of practice.

Togo – After the death of President &lt;a href="w%3AGnassingb%C3%A9%20Eyad%C3%A9ma"&gt;Gnassingbé Eyadéma&lt;/a&gt;, the army of the African state of &lt;a href="w%3ATogo"&gt;Togo&lt;/a&gt; has suspended the constitution and installed the son of the late President, &lt;a href="w%3AFaure%20Eyad%C3%A9ma"&gt;Faure Eyadéma&lt;/a&gt;, as the new leader.

The constitution stipulates that the parliament's speaker should take over power in the event of the death of the President. Eyadéma did not hold the office of Speaker of the Parliament at the time of his father's death.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAfrican%20Union"&gt;African Union&lt;/a&gt; has spoken of a "military coup" taking place in the country. The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; have also made calls for the army to respect the rules of the state.

By the time Eyadéma's death was announced on public radio, the army had already sealed the border. It then installed Faure, previously the communications minister, as president. Army Chief of Staff Gen Zakari Nandja said the decision had been taken to "avoid a power vacuum."

The speaker of parliament, &lt;a href="w%3AFambare%20Tchaba"&gt;Fambare Natchaba Ouattara&lt;/a&gt;, who was returning to Togo from Paris, was reportedly not permitted entry due to the border closure. He is now exiled in neighbouring Benin.

Gnassingbé Eyadéma, 69, Africa's longest-standing ruler, died while being evacuated for medical treatment abroad. After seizing power 38 years ago, he dissolved all political parties. He legalized elections due to popular pressure in &lt;a href="w%3A1991"&gt;1991&lt;/a&gt;, but won three elections. Accusations of electoral fraud and political repression continued. In &lt;a href="w%3A2002"&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt;, he amended the constitution to lower the minimum age for the presidency from 45 years to 35 years.

The day after the president's death, Natchaba was dismissed by the parliament and unanimously replaced by Faure Eyadéma by the deputies who were present at that time. The parliament also eliminated a constitutional requirement that elections be held within 60 days of the president's death, clearing the way for Faure to rule until the end of his father's term in &lt;a href="w%3A2008"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3APoland"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; – 
A list of 240,000 names from a &lt;a href="w%3ASoviet%20Union"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;-era secret file has been leaked on the internet. The list contains the names of potential collaborators with the &lt;a href="w%3ACommunism"&gt;Communist&lt;/a&gt; government of Poland, and its victims. The list has overtaken "sex" as the hottest search item on the &lt;a href="w%3Ainternet"&gt;internet&lt;/a&gt; in Poland. Piotr Tchorzewski, an employee of Poland's biggest Internet portal Onet, said:"This thing is huge. We have recorded around 100,000 Internet searches a day for the list, which is 10 times the number looking for 'sex'."

Last week the Polish journalist Bronislaw Wildstein obtained the list from the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.ipn.gov.pl/"&gt;National Remembrance Institute (IPN)&lt;/a&gt;. The files accessed by Wildstein were protected and few people--primarily historians and journalists--had been authorised to see them.

Wildstein obtained the list legally, and he distributed it to his colleagues. Somehow, the list has been leaked on to the internet. Since then the list has been copied and widely distributed on websites and peer-to-peer networks.

On the Onet site the list is at the top of search items. Visitors are referred to 650,000 links related to it. On &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; the search for "Wildstein list" returned 15,800 references on February 6, 2005.

The Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AMarek%20Belka"&gt;Marek Belka&lt;/a&gt; expressed concern for the safety of active intelligence agents whose names might be on the list.

United States – 
The &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Indian%20Movement"&gt;American Indian Movement&lt;/a&gt; protested against the controversial professor Ward Churchill, chairman of the Department of Ethnic Studies at the University of Colorado, who in a paper written after the &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%2C%202001%20attacks"&gt;September 11, 2001 attacks&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Trade%20Center"&gt;World Trade Center&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, compared the victims of the attack to "little &lt;a href="w%3AAdolf%20Eichmann"&gt;Eichmanns&lt;/a&gt;".

The American Indian Movement says Churchill’s statements comparing victims to Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann who implemented &lt;a href="w%3AAdolf%20Hitler"&gt;Adolf Hitler’s&lt;/a&gt; plan to exterminate European &lt;a href="w%3AJews"&gt;Jews&lt;/a&gt; and others should be condemned by all. Also, they say Churchill fraudulently represents himself as an Indian and a member of the American Indian Movement.

Additionally, Ward Churchill has perpetrated art fraud and plagerism. He was banned from selling his artwork in 1990.

&lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;LONDON&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; – 
The new police commissioner has warned middle class dinner party users of cocaine that he is out to get them. In contrast, he is relaxed about &lt;a href="w%3Acannabis"&gt;cannabis&lt;/a&gt; smokers, saying he does not wish to waste police time pursuing them. He has been quoted as saying: "People seem to think the price of a wrap of &lt;a href="w%3Acocaine"&gt;cocaine&lt;/a&gt; is 50 quid [UK pounds], but the cost is misery on estates here and a trail of blood back to &lt;a href="w%3AColombia"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;. Someone has died to bring it [cocaine] to a dinner party. People who wouldn’t dream of having a non-organic vegetable don’t seem to notice the blood on their fingers."

Blair is clearly trying to prick the conscience of the 624,000 estimated cocaine users in the UK, hoping to persuade them to boycott this Class A drug. Others, including Colombian winner and author , have stated that the misery both in Colombia and on poor housing estates in the UK is caused not by drugs themselves but by the banning of them. Marquez has specifically said that he cannot see the end of the civil war in Colombia as long as the illegal drug trade exists, and he cannot see the end of the illegal drug trade unless drugs are legalized. The trade in cannabis also generates violence both at home (in the UK) and abroad, in spite of Sir Ian's softly, softly approach to this recently reclassified Class C drug.

Colin A. Norman, Professor of Physics and Astronomy at 
&lt;a href="w%3AJohns%20Hopkins%20University"&gt;Johns Hopkins University&lt;/a&gt;, testifying before the 
&lt;a href="w%3AU.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; Committee on Science February 2nd, presented the &lt;a href="w%3AHubble%20Origins%20Probe"&gt;Hubble Origins Probe&lt;/a&gt; (HOP) as a replacement for the &lt;a href="w%3AHubble%20Space%20Telescope"&gt;Hubble Space Telescope&lt;/a&gt;.

Concerning the shuttle's estimated one billion dollar cost and 65 month
time-frame for deployment to earth orbit, Norman said: "The
groundbreaking science, the cutting edge technology generated in
the development of new instrumentation, the ability of Hubble
science to engage the interest of the public, and its impact on
the imagination of students, make it worthwhile to invest this
sum of public funds to complete the last chapter of Hubble's
remarkable legacy."

HOP will tackle three of the most central intellectual issues of
our age; the nature of &lt;a href="w%3ADark%20energy"&gt;dark energy&lt;/a&gt;, the nature
and distribution of &lt;a href="w%3ADark%20matter"&gt;dark matter&lt;/a&gt;, and the
prevalence of planets, including earths, around other stars.

Norman noted during the testimony that HOP would be, essentially,
a lighter copy of the Hubble Space Telescope and would include
two instruments that were scheduled for installation on the
Hubble: the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS), the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3), plus the new Very Wide Field Imager (VWFI) to be paid for and provided by Japan.

The VWFI has a field of view 17 times greater the advanced
camera on board the Hubble now, and is 3-4 times more sensitive
at critical wavelengths. This will provide for mapping 20 times
faster than achievable by the Hubble at present.

The COS would make possible the identification of the invisible
portion of "ordinary matter," potentially residing in gigantic
gas clouds discovered by the
&lt;a href="w%3AChandra%20X-ray%20Observatory"&gt;Chandra X-ray Telescope.&lt;/a&gt;

"The WFC3 has greatly enhanced power for discovery in the blue and
the red region of the spectrum and will significantly enhance
studies of galaxies and stars. Its infrared capability is
essential to studies of dark energy," Norman added.

"The decision is obvious. We must continue with the
Hubble adventure to explore these great questions
further, to understand more fully our remarkable
Universe and our place in it. We must do this with
intense determination and energy and thus continue to
inspire new generations with the wonder and thrill of
exploration and discovery," concluded Norman.

Colin Norman was educated at the University of Melbourne and
Oxford University. He has been a professor of physics and
astronomy at Johns Hopkins University and astronomer at the 
&lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Telescope%20Science%20Institute"&gt;Space Telescope Science Institute&lt;/a&gt; since 1984.

Thailand – &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Thailand"&gt;Prime Minister of Thailand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AThaksin%20Shinawatra"&gt;Thaksin Shinawatra&lt;/a&gt;, appears likely to be returned to office, making history as the first elected Thai PM to win a second term. If exit poll indications are borne out, his &lt;a href="w%3AThai%20Rak%20Thai"&gt;Thai Rak Thai&lt;/a&gt; (Thais Love Thais) party will win in a landslide, to become the first single party majority in Thailand's &lt;a href="http%3A//www.nationbynation.com/Thailand/history2.html"&gt;relatively short history&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AParliament"&gt;parliamentary&lt;/a&gt; democracy.

The Thai Rak Thai (TRT) Party looks set to secure approximately 375 seats in the &lt;a href="w%3AThailand%20legislative%20election%2C%202005"&gt;election&lt;/a&gt;, allowing them to form the first single-party elected government in Thailand's history. The main opposition party, &lt;a href="w%3ADemocrat%20Party%20%28Thailand%29"&gt;Pak Prachatipat&lt;/a&gt; (Democratic Party), had hoped to secure 201 seats to prevent a TRT majority but conceded defeat long before the ballots were completely counted. The leader of the Democrats, Banyat Bantadtan, has announced he will resign.

"I would like to congratulate Thai Rak Thai for achieving its goal of being a single-party government," Banyat Bantadtan, leader of the Pak Prachatipat is quoted by the Independent as saying. "I would like to encourage the two other opposition parties to join the Democrat party in monitoring the government for the benefit of the people."

TRT has promised to eradicate poverty, by spending $60 billion on new infrastructure and pushing ahead with privatisation of state firms against fierce opposition from unions. Cheap loans and subsidised healthcare for Thailand’s poor rural areas sweetened the deal.

<h4>History and issues</h4>

Already making history as the first elected PM to serve a full term, Thaksin is widely viewed as turning the recent &lt;a href="2004%20Indian%20Ocean%20Tsunami"&gt;Tsunami disaster&lt;/a&gt; into a political asset. When five- to eight-thousand Thais and foreign tourists were killed in the disaster, Mr. Thaksin responded by touring affected regions, refusing international aid loans, and promising farmers, fishermen, and the tourism industry support and compensation.

Thailand's economic growth rate during the past term in office had broken 6 per cent, second only to China, and rural income soared by 20 per cent.

Another big issue during the previous term was conflict between security forces and Muslim insurgents in the three southernmost provinces of Narathiwat, Pattani and Yala. With around 10-30,000 troops on duty guarding polling stations, no overt violence arose during the vote, although there had been around 600 deaths in the past 13 months.

Thaksin himself has been dogged by conflict-of-interest and nepotism allegations, including in 2001 charges of concealing financial assets, which could have put him out of politics for five years. A controversial 2003 campaign against drug users was widely seen as amounting to simple assassination of drug dealers, with several hundreds or thousands of alleged extra-judicial killings condemned by the United Nations.

After first entering Thai politics in 1994 as head of the anti-corruption Palang Dharma Party, the multi-billionaire head of telecom giant Shin Corporation had set about building TRT for the 2001 election. Forming a coalition from previous parties and factions, Thaksin was seated as PM with 248 seats of 438 to TRT.

<h4>"Free, but not fair"</h4>

Election officials said there were 146 allegations of fraud which merited investigation, with opposition and independent observers saying that vote buying had started weeks ago. However, more than 70 percent of the 44.8 million eligible voters cast ballots in the country's population of 62 million.

"The election may be free, but I don't think fair," said Somsri Hananuntasuk of the Asian Network for Free Elections, citing reports that party workers were paying Bangkok slum dwellers 200 baht ($5.21) each for votes.

Officials were reportedly planning to confiscate mobile phones at polling booths and to arrest voters who snapped a picture of their completed ballot papers with a camera phone as proof to claim a payment, though whether any such incidents occurred is unknown.

Two Election Commission volunteers were killed in the south by gunmen during campaigning last month, but, according to General Kowit Wattana, Thailand’s police chief, “Ambushes and killings of candidates are down from four years ago.”

"All of the &lt;a href="w%3AUlema"&gt;Ulema&lt;/a&gt; (clergy) and &lt;a href="w%3AMarja"&gt;Marja&lt;/a&gt;, and the majority of the Iraqi people, want the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Assembly%20of%20Iraq"&gt;National Assembly&lt;/a&gt; to make &lt;a href="w%3AIslam"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt; the source of legislation in the permanent constitution and to reject any law that is contrary to Islam," he said in his statement.

&lt;a href="w%3ADick%20Cheney"&gt;Vice President Cheney&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ADonald%20Rumsfeld"&gt;Donald Rumsfeld&lt;/a&gt; spent the weekend on television shows and interviews assuring the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; public the &lt;a href="w%3AIraqi%20legislative%20election%2C%202005"&gt;Iraqi elections&lt;/a&gt; would not result in a &lt;a href="w%3Atheocracy"&gt;theocracy&lt;/a&gt; for the country.

"We have a great deal of confidence in where they're headed," Mr. Cheney said on ♡❤Fox News Sunday♡❤. "I don't think, at this stage, that there's anything like justification for hand-wringing or concern on the part of Americans that somehow they're going to produce a result we won't like."

The violence of the insurgency, however, has returned after a brief lull following the elections whose final returns are expected in the coming week.

Bucharest, Romania – The &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ALunar%20New%20Year"&gt;Lunar New Year's Eve&lt;/a&gt; Festival will be celebrated in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABucharest"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARomania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; for the first time ever as an organised event. The celebrations will include live shows, food exhibitions and fireworks, and will take place on February 10 in Nichita Stănescu Park.

Designed to promote Chinese cultural heritage, the event will be organised by Bucharest City Hall, as well as the Romania-China Cultural Centre and the Chinese Embassy in Bucharest.

Signifying the end of the winter and the start of spring, the Chinese New Year takes place on a different day at the beginning of the year, based on the moon's position relative to the sun. The celebrations will mark the beginning of the Year of the Rooster.

Bucharest, Romania – The international airport of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASibiu"&gt;Sibiu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARomania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;, will be modernised through 2007, when the city will become &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEuropean%20Capital%20of%20Culture"&gt;Europe's Capital of Culture&lt;/a&gt;. Representatives from the Sibiu County Council, Sibiu City Hall and the Sibiu prefecture asked the Romanian government to allocate funds for the modernisation of the airport. The city wants to update the airport infrastructure because the city will receive a tourism and visitor boom when it becomes the European Capital of Culture in 2007. 

Martin Bottesch, the president of Sibiu County Council, claims that five times more passengers will use the airport in 2007 than in 2004, when it received 45,000 passengers. The Sibiu International Airport currently has flights from Sibiu to &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABucharest"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt;, the Romanian capital, as well as to &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AMunich"&gt;Munich&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AStuttgart"&gt;Stuttgart&lt;/a&gt; in Germany and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABergamo"&gt;Bergamo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ATreviso"&gt;Treviso&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AVerona"&gt;Verona&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABologna"&gt;Bologna&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARome"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt; in Italy. Despite the air connections, train remains the most popular way of reaching the city, though it is believed that the modernisation of the airport will change this.

&lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASibiu"&gt;Sibiu&lt;/a&gt;, which is located in central Romania, in the province of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ATransylvania"&gt;Transylvania&lt;/a&gt;, is one of Romania's best-maintained and most-visited medieval cities. It is also one of Romania's most important cultural centres, home to the Brukenthal Museum, which is one of the most renowned in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ACentral%20Europe"&gt;central Europe&lt;/a&gt;. The city of 170,000 is also home to Romania's largest German population. While today it only makes up 1.6% of the city's population, Sibiu maintains an important German heritage in terms of culture.

The pre-trial hearings in the trial of the pop singer &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Jackson"&gt;Michael Jackson&lt;/a&gt; have begun the process of jury selection. An initial jury selection of 4,000 people has been narrowed down to 250 by Judge Rodney Melville and the prosecution and defence attorneys.

The process of selecting the final 12 jurors and eight stand-by-jurors will continue on February 14th, following the death in the family of Jackson's lead defence lawyer.

Jackson, 46, is accused of child molestation in a case which is expected to last up to six months.

The International Maritime Bureau, an agency of the International Chamber of Commerce, has stated that 30 sailors were murdered by &lt;a href="w%3Apirates"&gt;pirates&lt;/a&gt; during 2004. The Bureau's ♡❤2004 Annual Report on Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships♡❤ shows that the number killed has increased from the 21 who died in 2003, according to data collected by the IMB Piracy Reporting Centre in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

However, the total number of attacks has decreased--325 recorded attacks, down from 445 in 2003. 

&lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesian&lt;/a&gt; waters are the most violent, with 93 incidents; one-quarter of the global total of attacks. Tugs and barges are common targets, with crew members often being kidnapped.

&lt;a href="w%3ANigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt; has the most dangerous waters of any &lt;a href="w%3AAfrica"&gt;African&lt;/a&gt; country. In 2004, there were 28 attacks (down from 39), the third highest number of incidents in the world.

Load-factor dropped slightly to 76.4% whilst average yields only fell 2% between October and December. After what was expected to be a tough winter period for the airline industry--with the flamboyant &lt;a href="w%3ARyanair"&gt;Ryanair&lt;/a&gt; CEO Micheal O' Leary having stated in December that a "bloodbath" was to take place in the European aviation industry--the figures were better than expected.

Bucharest, Romania – According to the Economist Intelligence Unit, Romania was the 14th most preferred country in the world for foreign companies looking to relocate their activities. This confirms Romania's growing attractiveness for foreign investment.

The study examined the conditions in sixty countries, and took into account nine categories of indices: geographical proximity, political and security risks, economic stability, legislation, taxation, labour costs and skills level, and infrastructure. The scores given to the countries ranged from 1 to 10, 10 being the highest. The final composite score was calculated as a weighted average of the scores of the nine indicators. Some indicators, such as labour costs, had more weight than others.

Romania's final score was 7.08 points, edged out in Europe by only Bulgaria (7.08 points), Slovakia (7.12 points) and Czechia (7.26 points). Romania's strengths lay in the workforce cost category, where it received a score of 9.49, and in the geographical proximity chapter, where is received 8.35 points. It also scored well in the categories of economic stability and political and security risks, with 7.2 points each. The country's weaknesses were mainly in the infrastrucutre chapter, where it received just 4.6 points.

Romania is further expected to improve its score in the coming years, as the effects of its new 16% flat tax rate on personal income and corporate profit come into effect, and as the country joins the European Union in 2007.

The worldwide leader in attractiveness for business relocation was India, with 7.76 points, due mainly to very low labour costs, high skill levels and a stable legal system. India edged out China by a considerable margin, with China being ranked second, with 7.34 points. China lags behind India mainly due to its lack of a well-developed legislative system.

Surprisingly, wealthy countries such as Japan, Norway and Denmark ranked very low, mainly due to their very high cost of labour.

Bucharest, Romania – Cicerone Măgerusan, the chairman of Romanian agricultural company Agromec, from the city of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ATargu%20Mures"&gt;Târgu Mureş&lt;/a&gt;, was sentenced yesterday to seven years in prison for taking bribes of US$65,000. The anti-corruption court found him guilty of taking the bribes from a businessman in 2002 and 2003 in exchange for illegally handing over company shares. Măgerusan was investigated after the businessman informed prosecutors. He can now appeal the sentence only at the Supreme Court, the country's highest court.

The Cicerone Măgerusan case is seen as one of the first successes of a high-profile anti-corruption campaign that has started this year, due to the new Romanian president &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ATraian%20Basescu"&gt;Traian Băsescu&lt;/a&gt;, who has promised to crack down on widespread corruption in the country. Măgerusan is one of the first prominent figures to be imprisoned. 

While there remain other high-profile officials suspected of corruption, Romania has set a significant precedent in dealing with the corruption problem. Additionally, on Sunday, Traian Băsescu issued an ultimatum to police and prosecutors, giving them six months to prove that they are serious about fighting corruption.

&lt;a href="w%3ABucharest"&gt;BUCHAREST&lt;/a&gt;, Romania – The average production of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Agenetically-modified"&gt;genetically-modified&lt;/a&gt; (GM) &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Asoybean"&gt;soy&lt;/a&gt; grew by 50 tonnes to 250 tonnes per square kilometre last year, said Constantin Sin from the Romanian Ministry of Agriculture. Soy is the only GM crop allowed in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARomania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; for commercial purposes. Additionally, the area cultivated with the modified soy increased from 396 km² in 2003 to 581 km² in 2004. GM soy is mainly farmed in southeastern Romania, in the counties of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABraila%20%28county%29"&gt;Brăila&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ACalarasi%20%28county%29"&gt;Călăraşi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AIalomita"&gt;Ialomiţa&lt;/a&gt;.

In 1996, the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; endorsed the import of transgenic soy, and, in 2004, the green light was given for the sale of new genetically-modified products which were used for animal breeding. Globally, the largest producers of genetically-modified soy are the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AUnited%20States%20of%20America"&gt;United States of America&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AArgentina"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;.

The revolutionary space telescope that brought great images of space back down to Earth will lose out in &lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA's&lt;/a&gt; budget reorganisation for 2006. While NASA's budget will increase by 2.6%, most of &lt;a href="w%3AHubble%20Space%20Telescope"&gt;Hubble's&lt;/a&gt; $93 million in funding will be directed into bringing it safely to Earth. The big winners include the space shuttle program and the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Space%20Station"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt;, including the development of a new Shuttle replacement.

A planned fifth maintenance job on the space telescope was cancelled as a result of the Columbia disaster, and experts argue as to how long it can remain useful to scientists. It is expected to fail irreversibly by 2007 if vital work is not done.

Another project to bite the dust was the &lt;a href="w%3AJupiter%20Icy%20Moons%20Orbiter"&gt;Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter&lt;/a&gt; (JIMO), which would have been the largest satellite ever sent to the outer solar system. It was to have featured a new form of nuclear reactor as propulsion, but instead NASA has allocated $320 million to developing nuclear technologies in space in a less aggressive, more stepped approach.

In a January 2004 speech, &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; proposed a human return to the &lt;a href="w%3AMoon"&gt;Moon&lt;/a&gt; and a first journey to &lt;a href="w%3AMars%20%28planet%29"&gt;Mars&lt;/a&gt;. This grand aim is behind the agency's new budget, with $6.8 billion (over one-third of the total) devoted to the ISS, Space Shuttle and space travel support.

Israeli Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AAriel%20Sharon"&gt;Ariel Sharon&lt;/a&gt; and Palesinian President &lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud%20Abbas"&gt;Mahmoud Abbas&lt;/a&gt; today declared an end to military and violent activities against each other. The two leaders made the expected announcement at a summit held at Shram el-Sheikh, Egypt, the first such meeting between the two sides in four years.

Prime Minister Sharon pledged to end military operations against Palestinians, and President Abbas similarly said that the Palestinians will likewise end "all acts of violence against Israelis...wherever they are". Both leaders expressed hope that the agreement will lead to long term peace in the long-running conflict. Prime Minister Sharon said that the agreement is part of the goal of "quiet, dignified and peaceful lives for all the nations in the Middle East". President Abbas said "the calm that is currently prevailing in our territories signals the start of a new era, the start of a hopeful peace." Both sides also confirmed their intent to create an independent Palestinian state. The talks became possible in the renewed optimism after the death of &lt;a href="w%3AYassir%20Arafat"&gt;Yassir Arafat&lt;/a&gt; and the election of Abbas.

The agreement marks a profound change in Israeli-Palestinian relations, but the negotiated truce is a shaky peace. The ability of President Abbas to exert control over Palestinian militant groups is questionable, and thorny political issues remain for the Israelis if they begin to withdraw settlers from the occupied territories. There are signs that the Palestinian resistance groups are willing to participate in the cease-fire: the terrorist organisation, &lt;a href="w%3AHAMAS"&gt;HAMAS&lt;/a&gt; released a statement in the hours before the summic stating that "was prepared to calm down resistance raids in the event the Zionist entity reciprocated," referring to Sharon's pledge to stop military activities, yet shortly after the summit a spokesman for the organization said it will not be bound by the cease-fire.

The agreement includes a pledge by Israel to release 900 Palestinian prisoners, to create join committees on prisoner release and the withdrawal of troops from Palestinian territories, and cooperation with Palestinian security forces in occupied areas.

&lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; has announced that it plans to purchase antivirus firm &lt;a href="w%3ASybari%20Software"&gt;Sybari Software&lt;/a&gt; in order to expand its market within the computer security market. The takeover comes after Microsoft purchased Romanian security firm &lt;a href="w%3AGeCad"&gt;GeCad&lt;/a&gt; in 2003 and two months after an announcement that it is to acquire anti-spyware vendor Giant-Company Software.

Sybari is a private company based in &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Newport"&gt;East Newport&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; that develops antivirus software which can be used with Microsoft's &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20Exchange"&gt;Exchange&lt;/a&gt; software, as well as with the &lt;a href="w%3ALotus%20Notes"&gt;Lotus Notes&lt;/a&gt; system.

This takeover is seen by analysts to be hostile move on Microsoft's part, as it places the software giant in direct competition with market leaders &lt;a href="w%3ASymantec"&gt;Symantec&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMcAfee"&gt;McAfee&lt;/a&gt;. Sterling Auty, an analyst with JP Morgan, told Reuters that he estimated that Microsoft could be competing for up to five percent of Symantec's business and up to eight percent of McAfee's revenue.

Microsoft's shares rose $0.10 at midday to $26.26, while both McAfee and Symantec shares fell.

Alex Wolszczan of &lt;a href="w%3APenn%20State"&gt;Penn State&lt;/a&gt; and Maciej Konacki of &lt;a href="w%3ACaltech"&gt;Caltech&lt;/a&gt; announced the discovery of the smallest planet detected outside our solar system. The new body is located in the same planetary system where Wolszczan found the very first &lt;a href="w%3AExtrasolar"&gt;extrasolar&lt;/a&gt; planets in 1992.

The planet, approximately one-fifth the mass of &lt;a href="w%3APluto%20%28planet%29"&gt;Pluto&lt;/a&gt;, orbits the &lt;a href="w%3Apulsar"&gt;pulsar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APSR%20B1257%20plus%2012"&gt;PSR B1257+12&lt;/a&gt;, 1500 light years from Earth. "Despite the extreme conditions that must have existed at the time these planets were forming, nature has managed to create a planetary system that looks like a scaled-down copy of our own inner solar system," Wolszczan said.

Three terrestrial planets discovered earlier occupy orbits similar in proportion to the orbits of Mercury, Venus, and Earth. The new fourth planet is in an orbit six times larger than the third planet's position, corresponding to our own asteroid belt.

"Surprisingly, the planetary system around this pulsar resembles our own solar system more than any extrasolar planetary system discovered around a Sun-like star," Konacki said.

"Because our observations practically rule out a possible presence of an even more distant, massive planet or planets around the pulsar, it is quite possible that the tiny fourth planet is the largest member of a cloud of interplanetary debris at the outer edge of the pulsar's planetary system, a remnant of the original protoplanetary disk that created the three inner planets," Wolszczan explained.

Since the original discovery of planets in 1992, Wolszczan and colleagues, using the 
&lt;a href="w%3AArecibo%20Observatory"&gt;Arecibo radio telescope&lt;/a&gt; in Puerto Rico, ". . . feel now, with this discovery, that the basic inventory of this planetary system has been completed."

Copenhagen – The &lt;a href="w%3ADenmark"&gt;Danish&lt;/a&gt; people have voted to keep the current centre-right political coalition of the &lt;a href="w%3AVenstre"&gt;Venstre&lt;/a&gt; (The Liberal Party), &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20People%27s%20Party%20%28Denmark%29"&gt;Det Konservative Folkeparti&lt;/a&gt; (Conservative People's Party) and the &lt;a href="w%3ADansk%20Folkeparti"&gt;Dansk Folkeparti&lt;/a&gt; (Danish People's Party).

Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen's Liberal Party retained the largest number of seats in parliament. The governing coalition between the Liberals and Conservative People's Party remained intact. They will likely be supported largely by the Danish People's Party, which gained 2 seats. The &lt;a href="w%3ADet%20Radikale%20Venstre"&gt;Radikale Venstre&lt;/a&gt; (Radical Left) party gained the most seats of any party, although it remains outside the governing group of parties. The election marked the second time in a row that the Social Democrats were not the largest party in the parliament, a change from most of the 20th century. The party lost 5 seats and leader &lt;a href="w%3AMogens%20Lykketoft"&gt;Mogens Lykketoft&lt;/a&gt; resigned immediately after the election.

Venstre, the liberal party of the prime minister, campaigned on their municipal restructuring plan, as well as a continuation of the "tax-freeze" and tight immigration requirements. They also promised to see 60,000 jobs created during a second term.

The largest opposition party, the &lt;a href="w%3ASocialdemokraterne"&gt;Socialdemokraterne&lt;/a&gt; (Social Democrats) led by Mogens Lykketoft focused on employment, which they claim has decreased under the current government.

The Dansk Folkeparti, who support the Venstre-&lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20People%27s%20Party%20%28Denmark%29"&gt;Conservative&lt;/a&gt; coalition, criticized the "tax-freeze" but agreed, conditionally, to support it for another parliamentary term. They also wanted increasingly tough immigration restrictions.

<h2>Results</h2>

Going into the election, the governing coalition had 94 of the 175 seats up for election. (Danish overseas territories designate four additional representatives).

&lt;a href="w%3ABrasilia"&gt;BRASILIA&lt;/a&gt;, Brazil – The Brazilian Ministry of External Relations decided to remove the English language knowledge section from qualifying tests required by the Brazilian school of diplomats, the Rio Branco Institute. The decision proved controversial among Brazilians.

In &lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;, those interested in following a diplomatic career first must study at the Brazilian school of diplomats: the Rio Branco Institute (IRBr).

After having passed the Rio Branco Institute's (IRBr) entrance examination, the student becomes a Third Secretary. The career path then continues to Second Secretary, First Secretary, Counselor, Second Class Minister, and First Class Minister or Ambassador. 

The candidate must fulfill the following requirements before signing up for the entrance examination to IRBr:
be Brazilian by birth, have a clean criminal record, be up-to-date with military and electoral obligations, and have concluded a full undergraduate course recognized by the Ministry of Education before the date of inscription.&lt;a href="http%3A//www2.mre.gov.br/irbr/cacd/INGLES.HTM%23exam"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The course of study is 2 years long. In the first year, the student has lectures in International Public Law, Economics, Brazilian Foreign Policy, History of International Relations, Theory of International Relations and Brazilian Readings, Diplomatic Language, English, French, and Spanish. For every three class hours on concepts, there is one lecture, seminar, workshop or debate guided by an expert in the field.

In the second year, the student develops his diplomatic professional skills. He works as a trainee in different units of the government and at Brazilian embassies and consulates in South America and Mexico.

The following written tests are part of the entrance examination: Portuguese, English, French and Spanish languages; History, Geography, Brazilian and International Law, Brazilian and International Economy, and International Politics. Also, the following oral tests are required: International Politics, English, and Portuguese language.

Until 2004, the English language tests could eliminate a candidate. However, on December 7, 2004, the Brazilian Minister of External Relations &lt;a href="w%3ACelso%20Amorim"&gt;Celso Amorim&lt;/a&gt; changed the entrance examination rules. Failing the English test no longer removes the student from the program. &lt;a href="http%3A//www2.mre.gov.br/irbr/CACD/CACD2005/DiarioOficialdaUniaoPort467.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 

The following tests can still remove a person from the program: Portuguese language, History, and Geography. 

The Minister Celso Amorim explained his decision: "This is a democratic decision. I would rather have a diplomat who knows Portuguese and Brazilian History well than another one who knows English well".

However, the decision proposed by the Ministry of External Relations caused some controversy.

The Senator and former diplomat Arthur Virgílio(&lt;a href="w%3APSDB"&gt;PSDB&lt;/a&gt;) sent a letter to Minister Celso Amorim protesting against the change in the entrance examination to IRBr. He said that the minister's decision is nonsense, a symbolic protest against the USA. The decision minimizes the importance of English in the world. According to him, the government is being underhanded. "The question is not to love or to hate the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, but to recognize their enormous weight, until bothering, in the world-wide scenario," he added. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.senado.gov.br/Agencia/verNoticia.aspx%3FcodNoticia%3D43284"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The journalist and high critic of the government and the &lt;a href="w%3AWorkers%27%20Party%20%28Brazil%29"&gt;Workers' Party (PT)&lt;/a&gt;, Percival Puggina, said: "On March 18, 2004, during a opening speech of a popular restaurant of &lt;a href="w%3ACoca-Cola"&gt;Coca-Cola&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ABelo%20Horizonte"&gt;Belo Horizonte&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http%3A//www2.coca-cola.com/presscenter/nr_20040318_americas_zero_hunger_project.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, President Lula said: 'I spent much time in my life thinking that if you wanted to be anti-American you should not drink Coca-Cola. Later, I got more mature and realized that there is nothing better than waking up at night and finding a Coca-Cola in the refrigerator.' However, Lula’s &lt;a href="w%3Aanti-americanism"&gt;anti-Americanism&lt;/a&gt; which still remains is more naive than not drinking Coca-Cola. The Ministry of External Relations under the rule of Celso Amorim gives us a clue when it eliminates the English knowledge skills as a requisite to the entrance at the Rio Branco Institute. I assume that this is a kick in both &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush’s&lt;/a&gt; groin and in &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Blair’s&lt;/a&gt; ankle. &lt;a href="w%3ACam%C3%B5es"&gt;Camões&lt;/a&gt; is thankful, but he excuses the courtesy."&lt;a href="http%3A//www.puggina.org/2003/publicados/news.php%3Fdetail%3Dn1106452087.news"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

In an interview with the Brazilian newspaper Folha de São Paulo, the Minister Celso Amorim told:”It should be explained that the English language was not removed from the examination, and it will not stop being obligatory; it will just not remove students anymore. Brazilian diplomats will still have to know English as well as other languages too. What the Itamaraty (the Brazilian Ministry of External Relations) decided was to take for itself the costs of the necessary complementation so that the diplomat has the domain of the language.” Amorim also added: ”There are many people who I knew during my life with all the requisites to be diplomats, but who had difficulty to pass in an examination of eliminatory English.”&lt;a href="http%3A//observatorio.ultimosegundo.ig.com.br/artigos.asp%3Fcod%3D313ASP002"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

According to Amorim, the English language elimination test favors the children of diplomats. Ricardo Neiva Tavares, spokesman of the Itamaraty, says that with the changes candidates of all regions of the country can compete evenly to enter the diplomatic career.

The former chancellor Celso Lafer criticized the decision: "Portuguese is not the language used in international communication." According to him, the change in the admission examination is a false idea of democratization.

&lt;a href="w%3ACristovam%20Buarque"&gt;Cristovam Buarque&lt;/a&gt; professor of University of Brasilia, senator (&lt;a href="w%3AWorkers%27%20Party%20%28Brazil%29"&gt;PT&lt;/a&gt;) and former minister of Education during Lula’s government said: “The knowledge of foreign languages, especially of English, is absolutely necessary to the diplomat. But this knowledge little says about the potential of creativity, knowledge, and ability of a youth who intends to enter the diplomatic course. &lt;a href="w%3AHenry%20Kissinger"&gt;Henry Kissinger&lt;/a&gt;, for example, would have been disapproved of in our course of diplomacy, since he still speaks with a German accent.”

The community of the town of Condoto, 600km of &lt;a href="Bogota"&gt;Bogota&lt;/a&gt;, in the region of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChoc%C3%B3"&gt;Chocó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , has been surrounded by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFARC"&gt;FARC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for a week. The rebel army is interfering with the movement of people, food, and medicine to the city. According to the Government of Chocó Secretary Fredy Lloreda the action is apparently in retaliation for recent operations performed by government forces against the rebels.

The FARC are a Marxist revolutionary group with about 12,000 members which originated from the Colombian Communist Party of the 1960s. The FARC's main stated objective is the creation of a Communist government in Colombia.

According to the Colombian government, the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Interpol"&gt;Interpol&lt;/a&gt;, the majority of the FARC's recent funding has come from kidnapping, extortion, hijacking, and illegal trade in cocaine.

The FARC are considered a terrorist group by the governments of Colombia and the United States, a Colombian ally in the fight against the FARC. The FARC are a member of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AForo%20de%20S%C3%A3o%20Paulo"&gt;Foro de São Paulo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and are opposed to the influence of the government of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="South%20America"&gt;South America&lt;/a&gt;.

A close encounter with the supermassive &lt;a href="w%3ABlack%20hole"&gt;black hole&lt;/a&gt; at the center of the &lt;a href="w%3AMilky%20Way"&gt;Milky Way&lt;/a&gt; has set a star on a one way trip into intergalactic space. The star, detected at the &lt;a href="w%3AMMT"&gt;MMT&lt;/a&gt; Observatory in &lt;a href="Tucson"&gt;Tucson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Arizona"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;, is zipping outward at a speed of 1.5 million miles per hour. Rocketing along at twice the galactic escape velocity, the &lt;a href="w%3AMilky%20Way"&gt;Milky Way's&lt;/a&gt; gravitational attraction doesn't have the holding power to keep the star from disappearing into the emptiness between galaxies.

"We have never before seen a star moving fast enough to completely escape the confines of our galaxy," Warren Brown of the &lt;a href="w%3ASmithsonian%20Astrophysical%20Observatory"&gt;Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics&lt;/a&gt; (CfA) said. "We're tempted to call it the outcast star because it was forcefully tossed from its home. Only the powerful gravity of a very massive black hole could propel a star with enough force to exit our galaxy."
Using measurements of the star's line-of-sight velocity, the scientists have concluded the star, cataloged as SDSS J090745.0+24507, is moving almost directly away from galactic center. Composition and age of the star also provide evidence of the star's origin and ultimate fate. "Because this is a metal-rich star, we believe that it recently came from a star-forming region like that in the galactic center," said Brown. Less than 80 million years were needed for the star to reach its current location, which is consistent with its estimated age.
Margaret J. Geller, Michael J. Kurtz and Scott J. Kenyon, along with Brown, will publish their find in an upcoming issue of ♡❤The Astrophysical Journal♡❤.

The Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where scientists study the origin, evolution and ultimate fate of the universe.

&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href="w%3ACarly%20Fiorina"&gt;Carly Fiorina&lt;/a&gt; was ousted by the board of directors of &lt;a href="w%3AHewlett%20Packard"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, much to the delight of Wall Street. Ms Fiorina's resignation was the result of a disagreement with the board over the future of the company. Often cited as America's most powerful businesswoman, Ms Fiorina presided over the multi-billion dollar merger between Hewlett Packard and Compaq Computers in 2002. 

The move comes after several months of intense speculation about her future with the company. Having promised billions in annual savings to the company from the 2002 merger, the combined company failed to keep pace with competitors such as &lt;a href="w%3ADell"&gt;Dell&lt;/a&gt;, or to deliver any significant increases in profits, particularly in the personal computer market. A recent investigation by &lt;a href="w%3AFortune%20magazine"&gt;Fortune magazine&lt;/a&gt; highlighted the fact that the firm's highly profitable printer business supported the lower-margin computer business. 

After the announcement, HP shares surged 10% on Wall Street against a generally poor performance by the major indices.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has taken over a case covering several cities. Police found &lt;a href="US%20dollar"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;250,000 in sealed bags, intercepted between &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AColumbus%2C%20Ohio"&gt;Columbus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOhio"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and Northeast &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APhiladelphia"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . State troopers counting the cash became ill, and one was hospitalized. The cash is believed to be drug money.

Sources told CBS 3 tests on the cash counter revealed the presence of a toxin derived from the bacteria staphylococcus. There is speculation the contamination may have been deliberate to prevent the money being tampered with in transit.

FBI Spokesperson Jerri Williams said, “This is under investigation and we have no information to provide to the public at this time."

A warning has been issued recommending that officers should take extra precaution and wear protective masks when handling suspected drug money.

Minor violent incidents and claims of Lebanese sabotage marked an unsteady start today for the Israeli-Palestinian truce, already threatened after militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad announced that they were not bound by the agreement.

Two Israeli motorists escaped uninjured in the West Bank today after coming under fire from Palestinian gunmen.

Elsewhere, Hamas militant Hassan Alami was found dead in the Khan Younis camp of Southern Gaza, killed while carrying out activities for the group. Although Hamas refused to be bound by the agreement signed yesterday in Sharm el-Sheik, it has promised to keep quiet at the request of Mahmoud Abbas.

Another Palestinian man is in a critical condition after being shot in the chest. The man, from the Rafah refugee camp, was shot near the Israeli settlement of Atzmona. The Israeli army, which has a garrison in Atzmona, is looking into the incident.

Meanwhile, Ramallah has accused Lebanese rebel group Hezbollah of attempting to sabotage the fragile peace agreement in the Middle East. The group, backed by Syria and Iran, are attempting to recruit Palestinian militants to engage in attacks of Israeli targets, claim Palestinian spokesmen. The charges mirror those made recently by Israel, which has long accused Hezbollah of bankrolling Palestinian violence in the region.

Hezbollah denies the charges, and claims to be honouring the ceasefire agreed yesterday. However, Palestinian officials claim to have intercepted bank records and email communications that prove that the guerilla group is recruiting militants in the West Bank. Abbas is shying away from any confrontation with the group at the moment, but has sent an envoy to Beirut to persuade Hezbollah to desist from its aggressive activities.

Despite the setbacks, Israel has begun to lift restrictions of travel and issue permits to 1000 Palestinians to work in Israel, as part of Tuesday's deal. Sharon has agreed to travel to Ramallah to continue talks toward peace in the region.

<h1>Explosion in Madrid; Basque separatists blamed</h1>
, 

At 8:30 am &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt; yesterday a car bomb exploded in downtown &lt;a href="w%3AMadrid"&gt;Madrid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASpain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, near the city's main convention center. The explosion occurred shortly before &lt;a href="w%3AJuan%20Carlos"&gt;King Juan Carlos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMexico"&gt;Mexican&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="w%3AVicente%20Fox"&gt;Vicente Fox&lt;/a&gt;, were due to open the ARCO art fair.

Forty-three persons were hurt, including 6 police officers. Reuters reports 24 were taken to the hospital, though none were seriously injured. The Juan Carlos I Convention Center suffered major damage to its facade from the blast.

Explosives experts estimated the size of the bomb between 20 and 30 kg (44-66 lb) of explosive material, according to Spain's Interior Minister José Antonio Alonso.
The blast is the most serious explosion in Spain since the March 11, 2004 &lt;a href="w%3AAl-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; train bombings. It coincides with a police crack-down on the &lt;a href="w%3ABasque"&gt;Basque&lt;/a&gt; separatist group &lt;a href="w%3AETA"&gt;ETA&lt;/a&gt; in the lead up to the Basque regional elections in April.

The Basque newspaper &lt;a href="w%3AGara"&gt;Gara&lt;/a&gt; received a warning from a caller claiming to be with the separatist group ETA half an hour before the blast, announcing that a car bomb would explode soon after.

&lt;a href="w%3AETA"&gt;ETA&lt;/a&gt; grew out of a call for action against &lt;a href="w%3AFrancisco%20Franco"&gt;Francisco Franco&lt;/a&gt;, who ruled Spain from 1939 until his death in 1975. A &lt;a href="w%3ABasque%20nationalism"&gt;Basque nationalist&lt;/a&gt; movement, ETA grew into a guerrilla force which, to date, is responsible for killing more than 800 people.

The goals of ETA are to force the creation of an independent Basque nation, including both the French and Spanish Basque regions. Initially, under the Franco dictatorship and during the transition periods following his death, ETA enjoyed widespread support in the Basque communities. With the increasing radicalism and violence of their methods, this popularity has waned, and organizations such as ♡❤Gesto por la Paz♡❤ (the Association for Peace in the Basque Country) now hold silent protests after ETA acts of terrorism.

Several commemoration ceremonies were recently held for victims of the &lt;a href="w%3AGreat%20Hanshin%20earthquake"&gt;Great Hanshin earthquake&lt;/a&gt; of 1995, mainly in &lt;a href="w%3AKansai"&gt;Kansai&lt;/a&gt; region. The municipality of Kobe and supporting organisations held one such ceremony in the early morning of January 17. It was the biggest ceremony held that day. Over 5,000 people gathered in the East Playground in the center of city. Participants included surviving citizens and volunteers from around the whole country who had helped out. At 5:43 a.m., just 10 years after the earthquake first occurred, people lit candles in honor of the 6,433 victims. The victims included 133 people who died in the aftermath of the disaster, due to physical or mental difficulties caused by the heavy changes in their life. 

The earthquake centered around &lt;a href="w%3AAwaji%20Island"&gt;Awaji Island&lt;/a&gt;, near the city of Kobe. It measured 7.3 on the &lt;a href="w%3ARichter%20Scale"&gt;Richter Scale&lt;/a&gt;, the biggest quake to hit Japan since &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20War%20II"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. Though a great earthquake could theoretically occur in any part of Japan, and scientists had warned of the possibility of earthquakes in the Kansai region, citizens and local government tended to be unaware of this possibility 10 years ago. The death and destruction caused by the quake gave a serious shock to the city's residents. One story of the Kobe city hall was totally destroyed, and a part of Meishin Highway between Nagoya and Kobe was ripped apart; a bus barely avoided falling from the broken highway. Engineers buttressed vulnerable city structures throughout Japan after the earthquake. Research revealed that architecture designed under national earthquake-proof standards had survived the earthquake. Many old buildings were rebuilt, reconstructed, or given structual support. Vulnerable city infrastructure was also attended to; in some areas water and fuel supply had been disrupted for over two months. Many municipalities reviewed their standards for civil engineering design.

The earthquake also revealed systematic vulnerability within the Japanese government. The prime minister at that time, &lt;a href="w%3ATomiichi%20Murayama"&gt;Tomiichi Murayama&lt;/a&gt;, first learned of the earthquake from a TV news program two hours later, and not from a government report. He called his secretary, who also knew nothing of it. The government improved these weaknesses, and in the case of the &lt;a href="w%3A2004%20Chuetsu%20Earthquake"&gt;Chuetsu Earthquake&lt;/a&gt; in October 2004, the prime minister's office was able to quickly deal with the accident.

After the earthquake, many people spent days in shelters. 104,900 houses were completely destroyed, and 144,256 only partly desroyed. The Hyogo prefecture and municipalities provided temporary shelters, called Kasetsujutaku. Such temporary houses had remained since 2000. Since those houses were provided to individuals and not to communities, many people found they were no longer with their familiar neighbors after moving. This caused serious problems among people, especially the elderly. Since 2000, around 200 people have died alone in such temporary houses, to be found only days later; this was considered a serious social problem. A word was even coined for this situation, ♡❤Kodokushi♡❤ (meaning "death in solitude" in Japanese), but some say no effective solution has yet been offered. 

The earthquake has also had a bright side. Before the earthquake, it was not popular to participate voluntarily in social activities in Japan. The earthquake moved many people to join such activities. Since it was close to the end of the Japanese schoolyear, many students could stay in the affected area for long days. And it has been not easy to have a vacation for Japanese workers, as many people took vacations from their company and went to the affected area to help out. This was not just a temporary movement, but influenced people to consider such social engagement as a regular activity (one can see a similar influcence in the case of the Chuetsu Earthquake).

<h1>$158 billion missing in U.S. Medicare drug benefit cost estimate</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=%24158%20billion%20missing%20in%20U.S.%20Medicare%20drug%20benefit%20cost%20estimate&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;a href="w%3AMedicare%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;U.S. Medicare&lt;/a&gt; drug benefit cost estimates rise to &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20dollar"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;558 billion in latest &lt;a href="w%3ACongressional%20Budget%20Office"&gt;Congressional Budget Office&lt;/a&gt; (CBO) estimates.

The CBO estimated that the &lt;a href="w%3AMedicare%20Prescription%20Drug%2C%20Improvement%2C%20and%20Modernization%20Act"&gt;Medicare Modernization Act&lt;/a&gt;, "would result in additional direct spending of about $395 billion over the 2004-2013 period." The estimate included $552 billion mandatory spending for Medicare Part D, offset by savings of $13 billion from changes to Parts A and B, and "estimated savings of $145 billion in &lt;a href="w%3AMedicaid"&gt;Medicaid&lt;/a&gt; and other federal programs because the Part D benefit would reduce spending in those federal programs."

Although the projections only slightly modified the net costs, from $552 billion to $558 billion, the $158 billion in offset from previous estimates were completely removed with a limited justification. "The estimated savings to Medicaid and other federal programs are incorporated in our baseline projections and are not separately identifiable," the CBO said.

The $552 billion dollar figure is missing from the November 2003 estimates, with a total cost for 2004-2013 presented as single line item of $410 billion as "Prescription Drug Benefit (Title I)." Over the same period the current estimate, which is categorized differently, lists the total costs for the "Benefits and Mandatory Administrative Costs" as $779 billion, with Part D. Premiums and payments by States reducing the number by $221 billion to $558 billion.

The report presented two tables: one justifying the prior $395 billion figure, including itemizations for "Savings to Medicaid and Other Federal Programs" totaling $145 billion and "Other Spending Effects" totaling $13 billion, and another presenting the current estimate, which only listed "Savings to Medicaid and Other Federal Programs" and "Other Spending Effects"as being "Not Separately Identifiable."

"This just brings us back to the Bush administration's credibility gap," Rep. Charles Rangel of New York told the L.A. Times. Medicare is overseen by the House Ways and Means Committee, and Rep. Rangels is the senior Democrat on the committee. "How can we trust them on Social Security when they did not play straight with the facts on Medicare?" he said.

Dr. Mark B. McClellan, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, disagreed, saying "there has been no significant change in the cost of the drug benefit" for the years 2006 - 2015 despite the numbers he brought forward having a cost of $1.2 trillion dollars. He points to a difference in years covered by his estimates as the reason, and that the numbers represented "gross costs" and did not reflect premiums paid by Medicare beneficiaries, compulsory contributions by states or savings to the Medicaid program.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Togo%27s%20new%20leader%20promises%20elections%2C%20but%20doesn%27t%20say%20when&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The new leader of &lt;a href="w%3ATogo"&gt;Togo&lt;/a&gt;, the late president Gnassingbé Eyadéma's son, Faure Gnassingbé, pledged to hold "free and transparent elections which reflect the will of the people" as soon as possible, though he did not mention a specific timeframe, nor did he address international criticism of his ascession to power. 

Togolese politics have become a subject of criticism by the &lt;a href="w%3AAfrican%20Union"&gt;African Union&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; after the death of Eyadéma late last week. Eyadéma was Africa's longest-ruling leader whose 38-year rule was marked by government-sponsored violence and the stifling of political expression. 

The Constitution of Togo was amended to permit Eyadéma to retain power, to allow more than two five-year terms in office, and to lower the minimum age for a president from 45 to 35. The latter move was seen as a way to allow the succession of the presidency to Eyadéma's son, then only 35 years old.

When Eyadéma died on Saturday of a heart attack, the country's Constitution called for power to be transferred to the head of the national assembly. Instead, Faure Gnassingbé assumed power and the Constitution was amended to allow this, causing criticism from foreign commentators.

Faure Gnassingbé also promised reforms, and an open dialog with the opposition parties. However, with the opposition leader out of the country since an assassination attempt in 1992, and the presidential term not set to expire until 2008, it is not clear how much change these promises will bring in the near future.

&lt;a href="w%3AGoogle"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; Inc. on Tuesday rolled out a test version of its mapping service &amp;mdash; a type of service long offered by its rivals Yahoo and Microsoft. The web site, http://maps.google.com, is designed to let users display maps of locations around the United States and Canada, find businesses near those locations, and generate driving directions between locations.

Unlike the competitors' offerings, Google's mapping system shows bigger maps and does not require a reload of the web page when a user pans or zooms the map. The site uses the Google Local search to incorporate local businesses onto the map. Google uses mapping data from TeleAtlas and Navteq, according to information shown on the mapping site.

&lt;a href="w%3APrince%20Charles"&gt;Prince Charles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABritain"&gt;Britain's&lt;/a&gt; heir to the throne, has announced that he is to wed his lover of 34 years, &lt;a href="w%3ACamilla%20Parker%20Bowles"&gt;Camilla Parker Bowles&lt;/a&gt;. In a press statement, the Prince of Wales said “Mrs Parker Bowles and I are absolutely delighted. It will be a very special day for us and our families.”

Mrs Parker Bowles will use the title "HRH The &lt;a href="w%3ADuchess%20of%20Cornwall"&gt;Duchess of Cornwall&lt;/a&gt;" after their marriage, and it is intended that following the Prince's accession to the throne, Mrs Parker Bowles will use the title "HRH The Princess Consort".

The pair are to marry on 8th April 2005 at a private civil ceremony in &lt;a href="w%3AWindsor%20Castle"&gt;Windsor Castle&lt;/a&gt;, which will be an occasion primarily for friends and family. There will then be a service of prayer and dedication in &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20George%27s%20Chapel"&gt;St. George's Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, to be conducted by the &lt;a href="w%3AArchbishop%20of%20Canterbury"&gt;Archbishop of Canterbury&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADr.%20Rowan%20Williams"&gt;Dr. Rowan Williams&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AQueen"&gt;Queen Elizabeth II&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APrince%20Phillp"&gt;Duke of Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt; also released a press statement saying: "The Duke of Edinburgh and I are very happy that The Prince of Wales and Mrs Parker Bowles are to marry. We have given them our warmest good wishes for their future together."

The proposed wedding is likely to raise many religious and constitutional questions, especially as Mrs Parker Bowles is divorced and her husband is still alive. However, the Archbishop of Canterbury said "I am pleased that Prince Charles and Mrs Camilla Parker Bowles have decided to take this important step."

The marriage will end many years of speculation spanning a relationship which has lasted since 1971. Following the death of the Prince's previous wife, &lt;a href="w%3APrincess%20Diana"&gt;Princess Diana&lt;/a&gt;, media speculation about the couple has increased.

&lt;a href="w%3APope%20John%20Paul%20II"&gt;Pope John Paul II&lt;/a&gt; left &lt;a href="w%3AGemelli%20Hospital"&gt;Rome's Gemelli&lt;/a&gt; hospital today, having been treated for throat spasms brought on by flu. The 84-year-old Pontiff had been in hospital for 10 days.

&lt;a href="w%3AVatican"&gt;Vatican&lt;/a&gt; spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, said that the Pope had been "cured" from the breathing difficulties, which lead to his hospitalization. Navarro-Valls also said that the Pontiff had undergone a number of tests, including a &lt;a href="w%3ACAT%20scan"&gt;CAT scan&lt;/a&gt;, which had ruled out any new illnesses.

The Vatican reports that the Pope has recovered his voice and that he will make his regular appearance for crowds in &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Peter%27s%20Square"&gt;St. Peter's Square&lt;/a&gt;. The Vatican is also being quiet regarding speculation as to the Pope's successor, the BBC reports.

The Pope's last appearance was from his hospital window on Sunday (6th February).

NEPAL – Nepalese opposition groups have taken to the streets of capital Kathmandu to protest against King Gyanendra's takeover of the government.

The first major protests started Thursday on the streets of Kathmandu, where protesters unfurled banners and shouted slogans. They were quickly arrested by police, who had caught wind of the plans and mobilized their forces on the streets.

At least ten arrests took place, sources say.

These protests were organized by the Human Rights and Peace Society (HURPES) and were announced earlier this week. The protesters are angry over King Gyanendra's decision to take over the government, censor the media, cut communications, ban dissent, arrest opposition leaders and place military on the streets.

Earlier in the week, Krishna Pahadi, the founder of HURPES, called for the protests.

"We would like to fill the jails of Nepal for the sake of democracy, human rights and the peace," he said.

HAVANA, Cuba – 
On Feb. 3, 2005, the Brazilian Minister of Education, Tarso Genro, opened the XIV International Fair of Books in &lt;a href="w%3AHavana"&gt;Havana&lt;/a&gt; during his five day visit to &lt;a href="w%3ACuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;. The fair is scheduled to continue until February 13, 2005.

Minister Genro opened the fair saying, "Cuba and Brazil have the same mixture and the same condition of sovereign nations." According to Genro, it was a honor for &lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; to be invited to the fair, where the country was the guest of honor.

At the fair, the Ambassador of Brazil in Cuba, Tilden Santiago, spoke in name of the Brazilian President, &lt;a href="w%3ALuiz%20In%C3%A1cio%20Lula%20da%20Silva"&gt;Lula&lt;/a&gt;, that the Fair of Books will help to strengthen the relatioship between both countries. "Between Brazil and Cuba there is a tradition of friendship which goes back to Cândido Portinari and Nicholas Guillén, Leo Brower and Egberto Gismont, and Alfredo Guevara and Glauber Rocha," he added. 

The Brazilian delegation donated 400 complete book collections to Cuba. The Brazilian addition to the fair included lectures, handiwork, films, literature, music, poetry, art demos and shows, and information on politics and history. 

Genro also met with &lt;a href="w%3AFidel%20Castro"&gt;Fidel Castro&lt;/a&gt;, President of Cuba. Among the subjects discussed were the interchanges between both countries in the educational field, relationships between universities, value of the Spanish language, Cuban methods of alphabetization, and Brazilian undergraduate students in Cuba.

A report documenting the civil rights record of the Bush administration has been removed from the Commission's website. The report was submitted to the administration in December by a committee, chaired by Mary Frances Berry, who has served as chair of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights for nearly 25 years. 

The report, ♡❤Redefining Rights in America: The Civil Rights Record of the George W. Bush Administration♡❤ described setbacks to a range of civil rights issues from policies that have further polarized communities. One week after Berry submitted the report, the Bush administration forced her out, announcing her replacement before she had actually resigned. The new chair, attorney Gerald A. Reynolds, was quoted in a ♡❤New York Times♡❤ article as saying he believed traditional civil rights group "overstate the problem" of racial discrimination. His appointment has been termed "a disaster" by NAACP Board Chairman Julian Bond. 

In an exclusive interview with Tolerance.org February 9, Berry warns of further erosion to civil rights, with a weakened Civil Rights Commission unable to press the Justice Department to enforce the laws.

<h1>Shakidor Dam bursts in Pakistan after heavy rain</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Shakidor%20Dam%20bursts%20in%20Pakistan%20after%20heavy%20rain&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

After a week of heavy rain and snow, the &lt;a href="w%3AShakidor%20Dam"&gt;Shakidor Dam&lt;/a&gt; near the coast of the southwestern &lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; province of &lt;a href="w%3ABalochistan"&gt;Baluchistan&lt;/a&gt; burst around 6:00 pm local time. So far, at least seventy people have died after five villages were swept away. Many bodies have been recovered by Coast Guard vessels sweeping the sea off the affected area with fishing nets.

Provincial Minister &lt;a href="w%3ASher%20Jan%20Baloch"&gt;Sher Jan Baloch&lt;/a&gt; announced troops have been called out for rescue operations. "The army has started rescue operations to try to save as many lives as possible." While over 1,000 have been rescued, possibly as many as 700 are missing - they may have been swept out to see, or may be seeking refuge on high ground or elsewhere. Alotogether, over 30,000 people have been affected.

President &lt;a href="w%3APervez%20Musharraf"&gt;Musharaf&lt;/a&gt; has announced a million dollars for the victims.

The 148 m (485 ft) long Shakidor Dam near &lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20cities%20in%20Balochistan"&gt;Pasni&lt;/a&gt; failed on Friday, sending thousands of people fleeing for safety. The dam, 800 km south of &lt;a href="w%3AQuetta"&gt;Quetta&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of Baluchistan, was built two years ago. Although the specific details are not known, it is believed the dam was overwhelmed by past week's heavy rains which have caused flooding in the region.

The flooding has cut off Pasni and other coastal regions, washing out roads and bridges. At least another 50 have died elsewhere as a result.

<h1>Canadian PM Martin testifies before sponsorship scandal inquiry</h1>
, 

&lt;a href="Paul%20Martin"&gt;Paul Martin&lt;/a&gt;, Prime Minister of &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, had the opportunity to testify Thursday before the Gomery Commission of Inquiry on the so-called "&lt;a href="w%3ASponsorship%20scandal"&gt;Sponsorship&lt;/a&gt;" scandal. The prime minister provide long and exhaustive, and many times exhausting replies to questions raised by Commission co-counsel, Mr. Finckelstein. The Prime Minister managed to distance himself from a programme about which his predecessor, The Right Honorable &lt;a href="Jean%20Chr%C3%A9tien"&gt;Jean Chrétien&lt;/a&gt; testified on Tuesday, had as its objective National unity which was a matter under his purview.

During questioning the Prime Minister sought to distance himself from the secret fund used to finance the sponsorship program. The unity reserve, he has said, was "deeply in the bowels" of the finance department's budget infrastructure, and did not receive more than semblant review before being approved.

"The responsibility of the minister of finance is to set the financial context," he testified, "Once the minister of finance does that, which is essentially the presentation of the budget, his responsibility comes to a total end."

The scandal involves hundreds of millions of &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20dollar"&gt;dollars&lt;/a&gt; spent in a program created to respond to the &lt;a href="w%3A1995%20Quebec%20referendum"&gt;1995 Quebec referendum&lt;/a&gt;. The funds were allocated to promote Canada through cultural and sporting events in Quebec, where separatist sentiment was still strong, but a 2003 report from &lt;a href="w%3ASheila%20Fraser"&gt;Sheila Fraser&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AAuditor%20General%20of%20Canada"&gt;Auditor General of Canada&lt;/a&gt;, suggested as much as $100 million may have been misspent for little or no work on advertising firms with close ties to the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Liberal Party of Canada&lt;/a&gt;.

Over the past year the Gomery Enquiry, appointed by PM Martin, has produced little evidence beyond that of the original report, but has provided a forum for the opposition parties to attempt to embarrass the ruling Liberal Party.

&lt;a href="w%3AArthur%20Miller"&gt;Arthur Miller&lt;/a&gt;, the revered American playwright, has died aged 89 in Roxbury, Connecticut. The creator of Death of a Salesman and The Crucible had been suffering from cancer and pneumonia.

Miller's most famous play, &lt;a href="w%3ADeath%20of%20a%20Salesman"&gt;Death of a Salesman&lt;/a&gt;, was first performed in 1949. Willy Loman, the central protagonist, became a symbol of the difficulties and frailties of the 'American Dream'.

Arthur Miller became embroiled in 1956 with the Communist hysteria which engulfed the United States as the Cold War began to take shape. When he refused to name friends and colleagues to the House Committee on Un-American Activities, he was held in contempt. The decision was later overturned, however Miller's experiences led him to write The Crucible, a thinly veiled critique of the McCarthyist witch-hunts.

Fans of Miller and his works worldwide paid tribute today to the Pulitzer-prize winning playwright. Zoe Caldwell, American actress who had appeared in Miller's "The Creation of the World and Other Business", told AP that Miller "was a big man and a deeply American man who was lucky enough to have extraordinary women in his life." Miller's fame was precipitated by his stormy relationship and subsequent marriage to Marilyn Monroe, which lasted five years.

"Mr Miller passed away at his home in Roxbury, Connecticut, last night at 9.17pm of heart failure," his assistant revealed. Mr Miller leaves behind three children: Jane-Ellen, Robert and Rebecca Miller.

Yesterday, the &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; television authority &amp;ndash; the CSA &amp;ndash; ordered &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEutelsat"&gt;Eutelsat&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Asatellite%20television"&gt;satellite television&lt;/a&gt; broadcaster, to stop transmitting the TV station ♡❤♡Sahar-1♡❤♡, operated by the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;ian government.

The ban was motivated by Sahar TV broadcasting &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aantisemitism"&gt;antisemitic&lt;/a&gt; fiction, as well as talk shows in which the existence of the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AHolocaust"&gt;Holocaust&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Agas%20chamber"&gt;gas chamber&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ANazi"&gt;Nazi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aextermination%20camps"&gt;extermination camps&lt;/a&gt; was denied.

A recently aired show, ♡❤For you, Palestine: Zahra's blue eyes♡❤, in the word of the French TV authority, ♡❤systematically presented Israelis and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AJew"&gt;Jew&lt;/a&gt;s in a demeaning manner, as persons without scruples, ready to steal the eyes of a Palestinian child♡❤.

French law criminalizes incitation to racial hatred, as well as the denial of the Holocaust.

The government-controlled Iranian media, as the anniversary of the liberation of the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AAuschwitz"&gt;Auschwitz&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aconcentration%20camp"&gt;concentration camp&lt;/a&gt; was approaching, published a number of columns in which the Holocaust was described as a "historical lie".&lt;a href="http%3A//goldwater.mideastreality.com/2005/jan/28_04.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Sahar TV has already come under the criticism of media watchdogs for antisemitic broadcasts.&lt;a href="http%3A//www.memritv.org"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

France's broadcasting authority, the ♡❤Conseil supérieur de l'audiovisuel♡❤ or ♡❤♡CSA♡❤♡, is an independent administrative authority. The nine members of the council are named one third by the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3APresident%20of%20France"&gt;President of the French Republic&lt;/a&gt;, one third by the President of the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AFrench%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt;, one third by the President of the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AFrench%20National%20Assembly"&gt;National Assembly&lt;/a&gt;.

France has already moved on several occasions to stop the broadcasts on its territory of antisemitic foreign broadcasters. On &lt;a href="December%2013"&gt;December 13&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="2004"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;, the French &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AConseil%20d%27%C3%89tat"&gt;highest administrative court&lt;/a&gt;, acting on the request of the TV authorities, issued an injunction ordering Eutelsat to cease broadcasting &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AHezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt; television &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AAl%20Manar"&gt;Al Manar&lt;/a&gt; in France.

COOK ISLANDS – Emergency centre officials expressed relief on 6 February 2005 (local time) that damage from Tropical Cylone ♡❤Meena♡❤, a category 5 storm, was less severe than anticipated after the eye of the storm bypassed the main island of Rarotonga. 

Over the previous 2 days, as the storm made its way through the island group, flights to and from both Rarotonga and the outlying islands had been suspended, planes put under cover or flown out of the area and tourist resorts evacuated in the face of forecasts of 270 km/h wind gusts and 10 metre storm surges. 

About 200 tourist stranded at Rarotonga Airport, after leaving their tourist resorts ahead of the storm, had to be evacuated to a local emergency shelter. Some criticised ♡❤Air New Zealand♡❤ for not giving more warning it was cancelling their flights.

Although flights resumed only 15 hours after the storm passed to the east, there was significant local flooding caused by 15 m high waves. Iconic store Trader Jacks was inundated by the sea as were other parts of Avarua town and northern Rarotonga coast. Although the cleanup is expected to take several weeks, damage was nowhere near as severe as that caused by Cyclone Heta to Niue in January 2004.

VICTORIA, British Columbia, Canada – The 2005 &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Columbia"&gt;British Columbia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASpeech%20from%20the%20Throne"&gt;Throne Speech&lt;/a&gt;, read by &lt;a href="w%3ALieutenant%20Governor"&gt;Lieutenant Governor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AIona%20Campagnolo"&gt;Iona Campagnolo&lt;/a&gt;, included a pleasant surprise for the Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research &amp;mdash; a promise of &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20dollar"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;100 million in 2007.

The spark which led to the foundation of the Michael Smith Foundation was struck by Nobel laureate &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Smith"&gt;Michael Smith&lt;/a&gt;, who saw a need in British Columbia to pursue research funding and helped connect the key organizations and stakeholders in health research in the province. Working toward their vision of health research leadership, and their strategic objectives of health improvement, research funding and BC's knowledge economy, they have striven to increase provincial investment in health research.

The &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20British%20Columbia"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt; government in &lt;a href="w%3AVictoria"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt;, which has set the next provincial elections for May 17, used the Throne Speech to announce a long list of spending initiatives &amp;mdash; most of them dependent on their re-election to power.

Tallinn, Estonia – The &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ANorthern%20Europe"&gt;Northern European&lt;/a&gt; country of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEstonia"&gt;Estonia&lt;/a&gt; is facing a boom in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AInternet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt; usage due to low prices and a dynamic market. In recent years, the country has tried to emulate the Scandinavian model of technological infrastructure and is now considered to be the most technologically-advanced of the former-Communist countries of Europe. Estonia, which joined the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; in 2004, has also exceeded other members and has become a leader in European internet usage.

The country is now one of the world's largest per-capita users of online banking, which has surged due to the growth in number of Internet leased-line connections. More impressively, the country is a European leader in terms of the number of permanent high-speed Internet connections. It is outstripped only by &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ADenmark"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ANetherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABelgium"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AFinland"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, and thus ranks 7th in the 25-member European Union in terms of broadband Internet penetration.

Estonia's Internet boom has also been due in part of government policy. The government now wants to use the 450 MHz band to create a new digital wireless network that would cover the entire country. Edvard Saarma, the chief of the Communications Department at the Economy Ministry, said that, "In principle, this will be like a large Wi-Fi network that will cover all of Estonia."

The stage has yet to be set, the lights haven't even been hung, but Juno fever is already starting to grip Canadians.

The 34th annual &lt;a href="w%3AJuno%20Awards"&gt;Juno Awards&lt;/a&gt; honoring Canadian music is scheduled to take place at the MTS Centre in &lt;a href="w%3AWinnipeg"&gt;Winnipeg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AManitoba"&gt;Manitoba&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; April 3 and it appears that people want to be a part of the action. 

Five hundred advance ticket packs that went on sale Friday at 10 a.m. (Canadian central time) sold out almost instantly. Tickets for the event will officially go on sale Saturday February 12, also at 10 a.m. Those tickets are expected to cost anywhere from CA$40 to CA$116, depending upon seating.

Tickets for the show have sold out quickly in previous years. The music awards show has gained popularity ever since private broadcaster &lt;a href="w%3ACTV"&gt;CTV&lt;/a&gt; began broadcasting it live in 2001. Last year the broadcast attracted 1.51 million viewers, making it the most-watched show of the evening.

This year &lt;a href="w%3ABrent%20Butt"&gt;Brent Butt&lt;/a&gt; will host the show with K-os, Billy Talent, k.d. lang, Neil Young, and The Tragically Hip already confirmed to perform. Earlier this week when nominations were announced Avril Lavigne led the pack with five nods. The rebel pop star was followed closely by Diana Krall who received four nominations for her album The Girl In The Other Room.

&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%2C%20New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; – A drug-resistant and quick-acting form of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, has been detected in New York City, according to officials.

Although diagnosed in only one man so far, this mutated version of the virus progresses to AIDS faster than other forms of HIV, officials said. Diagnosed with HIV in mid-October, the unnamed New York City man developed the full-blown form AIDS by mid-January. Normally HIV infection can take up to 10 years to develop into AIDS. 

Dr. Ronald O. Valdiserri, the director of HIV/AIDS prevention at the Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention (CDC), told the ♡❤New York Times♡❤ this new strain of virus is unique because of the rapid progression of the disease and its resistance to multiple AIDS drug regimens. Although the New York case appears to be isolated at this time, the CDC has sent a nation-wide alert to health departments in every state.

"It appears this individual has contracted a new, particularly virulent strain of HIV that swiftly advanced to AIDS in just a few short months," Charles Farthing, MD, AIDS Healthcare Foundation's Chief of Medicine said in a press release. "Unfortunately, it also seems that few of the AIDS treatments currently available today can be used in his case, as this particular strain of infection appears to be resistant to most known AIDS drugs."

Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, commissioner of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, urged all newly-diagnosed HIV patients to get tested to see if they have this new form of the virus. He also said all sexually active people should be tested for the HI virus.

New York health officials said they estimate that about 88,000 New Yorkers have HIV infection or AIDS and that an additional 20,000 are infected but unaware of their condition.

&lt;a href="http%3A//www.stats.govt.nz/products-and-services/table-builder/crime-tables/default.htm"&gt;New Zealand's Recorded Crime Statistics&lt;/a&gt; are now available online from &lt;a href="http%3A//www.stats.govt.nz/"&gt;Statistics New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;.

In an unheralded change to its website on January 20, 2005, Statistics New Zealand now provides the last 10 fiscal years of Recorded Crime Statistics for &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;. Using the ♡❤Table Builder♡❤ service, the country's Crime Statistics can now be examined and analysed online in unprecedented detail.

Although &lt;a href="http%3A//www.police.govt.nz/"&gt;New Zealand Police&lt;/a&gt; has previously published ♡❤&lt;a href="http%3A//www.police.govt.nz/service/statistics/"&gt;Official Crime Statistics&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reports online, these statistics have only ever been available at a summary level, as a printed style document. This development allows detailed information, that was only ever available though an information request to Police, to now be seen immediately and desired statistics can be manipulated interactively.

Statistics are available either nationally or by each Police district and area for the each of the last 10 years or each of the last 24 months. Recorded Crime Statistics can be analysed down to the individual offence, with scene information for recorded and resolved crime. Offender apprehension statistics are also analysed down to the individual offence as well as the age, gender, ethnicity and resolution action taken with the offender.

The Recorded Crime Statistics also have a significant amount of accompaning metadata. Relevant legislation for each offence, together with caveats and interpretation notes for each parameter accompany these statistics. Users can now interpret these statistics for themselves, rather than relying on other agencies interpreting, or possibly misinterpreting, their requirements.

This innovation appears to be a leading edge breakthrough in publically available crime statistics. Although a number of jurisdictions place statistical reports and summaries of crime statistics on websites, these all are in the form of printed style documents. This move appears to be the first time that internet users can interact with a website to extract their own customised reports from the available crime statistics.

Internationally, crime statistics have been difficult to obtain, and even more difficult to compare. Interpol, the international policing organisation, for example, does not even make international statistics publically available on its website but restricts them to authorised law enforcement officials. Other countries present their statistics in detailed reports that need to be read and interpreted with care to understand them correctly. Different countries also count crime in different ways, often ignoring less serious offences or only counting the most serious of multiple offences occurring at the same time. 

In New Zealand's case the basic data is now online. The analysis can be done by the user.

London, UK – After stagnation starting from 2001, the French economy grew at a rate of 2.3% in 2004, with growth picking up especially in the last three months of the year. However, the growth rate falls short of the 2.5% predicted by the French government. The seasonally-adjusted growth rate of 0.7-0.8% in the fourth quarter of 2004 is also the most solid growth since early 2002.

France, and the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEurozone"&gt;Eurozone&lt;/a&gt; as a whole, has faced economic stagnation since the September 11 World Trade Center attacks, which had profound effects on the global economy. Growth, however, picked up in 2004 and is expected to further improve in 2005. Unlike &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AItaly"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, France's economy has shown to be more resilient, even though it too slowed down in 2001-2003.

The government's target for 2005 is 2.5% growth. While the rebound in output is good news for Europe's third largest economy, unemployment remains one of the highest in Europe at 9.9%.

Sutter, CA – An elementary school in northern California has been testing a &lt;a href="w%3ARFID"&gt;radio frequency identification&lt;/a&gt; (RFID) tag-based identification program on its 7th and 8th grade students since January 18th, 2005. According to the &lt;a href="w%3AACLU"&gt;ACLU&lt;/a&gt;, this is the first time that public school students in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; have been required to wear devices that enable automatic identification. RFIDs have previously been used to track students in &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;.

RFID tags contain antennas to enable them to receive and respond to radio-frequency queries from an RFID transceiver, enabling identification of pupils when they are in the vicinity of the detectors.

Each student is required to wear an ID card on a lanyard around their neck. An RFID tag, manufactured by local Sutter corporation Incom, is attached to the card. The school has installed RFID detectors at the doors of seven classrooms as well as the bathrooms, though they claim that the bathroom units were not turned on, and subsequently been removed after complaints from parents.

While some parents have complained about the system, local high school teacher Tim Crabtree told the San Francisco Chronicle, "It's baffling why so many people are bothered by the district being able to tell them where their kids are at,"

On the other side, the San Francisco Chronicle quotes the 13-year-old daughter of Michelle and Jeff Tatro as saying:"Look at this. I'm a grocery item. I'm a piece of meat. I'm an orange." Another couple in Sutter, Michael and Dawn Cantrall, filed a complaint with the American Civil Liberties Union, or ACLU. The complaint centered on the violation of privacy and concerns about safety.

<h1>Pfizer and Microsoft team up against Viagra spam</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Pfizer%20and%20Microsoft%20team%20up%20against%20Viagra%20spam&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

New York – "Buy cheap Viagra through us - no prescription required!" Anyone with an active email account will recognize lines like this one. According to some reports, unsolicited advertisements (♡❤&lt;a href="w%3Aemail%20spam"&gt;spam&lt;/a&gt;♡❤) for Viagra and similar drugs account for one in four spam messages. 

Ever since pharmaceutical giant Pfizer promised to cure erectile dysfunction once and for all with its blue pills containing the drug ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3Asildenafil%20citrate"&gt;sildenafil citrate&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, spammers have tried to tap into male anxiety by offering prescription-free sales of unapproved "generic" Viagra and clones such as Cialis soft tabs. Legislation like the U.S. &lt;a href="w%3ACAN-SPAM"&gt;CAN-SPAM&lt;/a&gt; act has done little to stem the tide of email advertising the products.

Now Pfizer has entered a pledge with &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, the world's largest software company, to address the problem. The joint effort will focus on lawsuits against spammers as well as the companies they advertise. "Pfizer is joining with Microsoft on these actions as part of our shared pledge to reduce the sale of these products and to fight the senders of unsolicited e-mail that overwhelms people's inboxes," said Jeff Kindler, executive vice president at Pfizer. 

Microsoft has filed civil actions against spammers advertising the websites CanadianPharmacy and E-Pharmacy Direct. Pfizer has filed lawsuits against the two companies, and has taken actions against websites which use the word "Viagra" in their domain names. Sales of controlled drugs from Canadian pharmacies to the United States are illegal, but most drugs sold in Canada have nevertheless undergone testing by the U.S. &lt;a href="w%3AFood%20and%20Drug%20Administration"&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt;. This is not the case for many of the Viagra clones sold by Internet companies and manufactured in countries like China and India. While it was not clear that CanadianPharmacy was actually shipping drugs from Canada, Pfizer's general counsel, Beth Levine, claimed that the company filled orders using a call center in Montreal, reported the ♡❤Toronto Star♡❤.

For Microsoft's part, they allege that the joint effort with Pfizer is part of their "multi-pronged attack on the barrage of spam." As the creator of the popular email program Outlook, Microsoft has been criticized in the past for the product's spam filtering process. Recently, Microsoft added anti-spam measures to its popular Exchange server. Exchange 2003 now includes support for accessing so-called real-time block lists, or RTBLs. An RTBL is a list of the IP addresses maintained by a third party; the addresses on the list are those of mailservers thought to have sent spam recently. Exchange 2003 can query the list for each message it receives.

A former employee of &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle%2C%20Inc."&gt;Google, Inc.&lt;/a&gt; has said he was fired after he made a series of unfavorable comments about the company on a publically-viewable &lt;a href="w%3Ablog"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;. Mark Jen, formerly a &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; employee, began work at the &lt;a href="w%3AMountain%20View%2C%20California"&gt;Mountain View, California&lt;/a&gt; company on January 18. He then went on to make several observations about the company over the following week. In particular, some of the comments included information on the company's financial situation garnered from an internal conference and indications of the company's new products for 2005.

Nine days later, apparently of his own volition, Jen removed the comments from his blog. However, on January 28, Google fired him, an act which Jen attributes to his blogging. Google has not commented on his dismissal to other news sources, but has acknowledged that Jen no longer works at the company.

In his blog, on February 11, 2005, Jen appeared positive about his future. "I've actually viewed this as a great learning experience. Obviously, I've gotten a first-hand chance to learn about the power of blogging. I've also learned to be a little more analytical about situations, a lot more cautious and a lot less assuming."

&lt;a href="w%3AGaza"&gt;Gaza&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;a href="w%3AHamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt; announced that it will continue its undeclared ceasefire while it considers whether to officially join a ceasefire with &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; declared this week by the &lt;a href="w%3APalestinian%20Authority"&gt;Palestinian Authority&lt;/a&gt; and the Israeli Government at a conference in the Egyptian resort of &lt;a href="w%3ASharm%20el-Sheikh"&gt;Sharm el-Sheikh&lt;/a&gt;.

Palestinian leader &lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud%20Abbas"&gt;Mahmoud Abbas&lt;/a&gt; held talks earlier in the day with Hamas leaders at an undisclosed location, with the aim of persuading them to officially join the ceasefire. The BBC is reporting that Hamas is concerned about the pace of peace talks, worrying that protracted negotiations may lead to little benefit for the Palestinians.

Hamas (حماس), an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawamah al-Islamiyyah (Arabic: Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas is also Arabic for 'zeal' or 'courage'), is a Palestinian Islamist paramilitary and political organization, regarded by some as a militant organization and by others as a terrorist group.

The United States, Canada, Israel and the European Union, among others, consider Hamas a terrorist organization.

Hamas was founded by Shaikh Ahmed Yassin (later assassinated by the Israelis) and Mohammad Taha in late 1987, inspired by the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood. Currently led by Khaled Mashaal, the movement is dedicated to fighting the Israeli occupation of Palestine, which, in Hamas' definition, includes all of Israel and the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. The organization is highly popular among Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. It also has a following in the West Bank, and, to a lesser extent, in Israel, other Middle Eastern countries and throughout the Palestinian diaspora.

The movement's popularity stems from its paramilitary activities and its charitable operations; the provision of welfare and social services to the Palestinian poor.

Hamas is notorious for using the tactic of suicide bombing against Israel, particularly against civilians in busy city areas.

On Friday thousands of &lt;a href="Somalia"&gt;Somalis&lt;/a&gt; made a peaceful protest in &lt;a href="Mogadishu"&gt;Mogadishu&lt;/a&gt; against the planned deployment of &lt;a href="African%20Union"&gt;African Union&lt;/a&gt; troops into the country.

The Islamic Courts' Union, the Umbrella organisation of Islamic Clerics and the supporters of two warlords-turned-cabinet ministers, Husein Aideed and Osman Ali Ato organised the demonstration.

Many of the protestors claimed to reject the intervention of foreign troops on grounds of faith.

The African Union plans on deploying troops forming a Peace Support Mission to support the return of Somalians from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKenya"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The country has been without government since 1991 when President &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASiad%20Barre"&gt;Mohamed Siad Barre&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was overthrown, with various factions and warlords fighting for control since.

The new Transitional Federal Government, headed by President &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAbdullahi%20Yusuf%20Ahmed"&gt;Abdullahi Yusuf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , is due to take control on February 21.

Abdullahi Yusuf was elected President by Somalia's transitional parliament on October 10, 2004. He won the votes of 189 of the 275 members of parliament, with the election held in a sports hall in Nairobi, Kenya. His government is recognized by most western nations as the country's legitimate rulers

Cordon-bleu chef Homaru Cantu has announced a technique which allows him to create dishes made of edible, inkjet printed paper. Cantu, a head chef at the Moto restaurant in Chicago, has modified an ink-jet printer with the help of computer specialists from local firm Deep Labs and loaded it with cartridges containing concoctions of fruit and vegetables. Using this modified printer Cantu then prints onto edible sheets of soybean and potato starch tasty images downloaded from the web.

“You can make an ink-jet printer do just about anything,” says Cantu. Once the items have been printed they are dipped into a powder made of soy sauce, sugar and vegetables before then being further processed by frying, freezing, or baking them.

Cantu has applied the technique to the printing of menus so that diners can further flavor their soups by ripping up the menu and adding it to the dish.

He hopes that his idea may find its way into popular media. “Just imagine going through a magazine and looking at an ad for pizza. You wonder what it tastes like, so you rip a page out and eat it,” says the chef who is working at perfecting the flavors and has applied for a patent on the technique.

Cantu also has plans for further culinary innovations. He plans to cook steak using a handheld laser that will sear the inside of the steak well done whilst leaving the outside medium rare. He also plans to use the laser to produce bread baked from the inside out thus producing a crust on the inside.

<h1>Howard Dean elected chairman of U.S. Democrats</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Howard%20Dean%20elected%20chairman%20of%20U.S.%20Democrats&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHoward%20Dean"&gt;Howard Dean&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was elected the chairman of the &lt;a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday. The former governor of &lt;a href="Vermont"&gt;Vermont&lt;/a&gt; and a presidential candidate in the 2004 elections was chosen by a voice vote of the 447-member &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20National%20Committee"&gt;Democratic National Committee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Dean replaces &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATerry%20McAuliffe"&gt;Terry McAuliffe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as chairman of the committee.

The election of Dean to the post reflects the party's trust in his accomplishments during the presidential campaign. As a candidate, Dean mobilized support from across the country in his ♡❤Dean for America♡❤ campaign, using the Internet as a medium for organizing fundraising. According to MSNBC, the House Minority Leader &lt;a href="Nancy%20Pelosi"&gt;Nancy Pelosi&lt;/a&gt; said "He has used the power of technology, the force of his personality and the depth of his ideals to bring new people into the party." Dean did not win the party's nomination, which instead went to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Kerry"&gt;John Kerry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

In his acceptance speech, Dean called for increased organization, and standing up for the party's platform. He said "Standing up for our beliefs, organizing, and transforming our party into a grassroots organization that can win in all 50 states: That's how we will rebuild the Democratic Party."

Dean's new position faces a mixed reaction from other politicians. The chairman of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20National%20Committee"&gt;Republican National Committee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Ken Mehlman, said that "Howard Dean's energy and passion will add to the political discourse in this country and he will be a strong leader for his party." Former &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASpeaker%20of%20the%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;Speaker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the &lt;a href="US%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Newt%20Gingrich"&gt;Newt Gingrich&lt;/a&gt; has recently said that the Democrats should only elect Dean "if they have a true death wish."

&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; (UN) troops based in the &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo"&gt;Democratic Republic of the Congo&lt;/a&gt; face 150 allegations of &lt;a href="w%3Arape"&gt;rape&lt;/a&gt; including gang rapes committed against children as young as twelve. 

The UN's Office of Internal Oversight Services reported these crimes which occurred even while investigators were in Congo. The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Secretary-General"&gt;Secretary-General of the UN&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AKofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt; has condemned the soldiers and has banned the peacekeeping troops (those deployed in Congo) from having sex with local residents.

The soldiers are believed to have bribed young starving children with eggs, milk or a few dollars to have sex. There are believed to be at least fifty different soldiers involved. Kofi Annan pledged personally to "root out this problem." The United Nations has 65,000 troops in 16 different locations, with 16,700 UN soldiers and other staff in Congo alone.

Annan also faces serious allegations of impropriety for the UN's $64 billion oil-for-food program which allegedly enriched Annan's relatives, senior officials within the &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n and &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; governments and deposed &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;i president &lt;a href="w%3ASaddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt;. The UN's own internal inquiry headed by former United States &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Reserve"&gt;Federal Reserve&lt;/a&gt; Board chair &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Volcker"&gt;Paul Volcker&lt;/a&gt; confirmed misconduct allegations leading to the termination of several senior UN officials.

The &lt;a href="w%3AESA"&gt;European Space Agency's&lt;/a&gt; new Ariane 5 ECA rocket placed two satellites in orbit Saturday February 12, successfully completing its initial qualifying flight. The Ariane 5 ECA is to be the ESA's new workhorse launcher for injecting payloads into geostationary orbit.

Launched from the &lt;a href="w%3ACentre%20Spatial%20Guyanais"&gt;Guiana Space Centre&lt;/a&gt; at Kourou, French Guiana, the new rocket design carried three payloads: the X-TAR-EUR communications satellite, the Sloshsat FLEVO&lt;a href="http%3A//www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMLEZ0XDYD_index_0.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; experimental satellite, and the Maqsat B2 which remained attached to the Ariane upper stage.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAriane%205"&gt;Ariane&lt;/a&gt; ECA can carry up to ten tons of payload improving on the launch capacity of the Ariane 5 Generic by 4 tonnes.

This launch was the second test for the new design following a launch failure in December 2002.

&lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; The &lt;a href="w%3AShi%27a"&gt;Shi'a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Iraqi%20Alliance"&gt;United Iraqi Alliance&lt;/a&gt; (UIA) candidates have won at least 132 of 275 seats in the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Assembly%20of%20Iraq"&gt;Iraq National Assembly&lt;/a&gt;, according to the results announced Sunday.

Capturing 48.1% of the national vote, the UIA is the largest single block in the Assembly. Yet even so large a block must create alliances with other parties to form a unity government. There has been ongoing speculation the UIA is in negotiations with the &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Patriotic%20Alliance%20of%20Kurdistan"&gt;Democratic Patriotic Alliance of Kurdistan&lt;/a&gt; in advance of the poll results.

The union of the Khurdish parties garnered 25.4% of the national vote, equivalent to 71 seats, giving Khurds a vital voice in the National Assembly. The parties have reiterated their call for a Khurdish president or prime minister.

&lt;a href="w%3ASunni"&gt;Sunni&lt;/a&gt; voters stayed away from the election in droves, leaving them with very little representation in the Assembly. &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Iraqis"&gt;The Iraqis&lt;/a&gt;, the largest Sunni party in Iraq, received only 150,000 votes, less than two percent of the votes reported. The next largest, the Independent Democrats Movement, gained less than 0.1 percent.

The National Assembly vote on also included elections for governors, and the Khurdistan Assembly.

There are approximately 14.2 million eligible voters and 7,761 candidates in the Transitional National Assembly race. Approximately 58% of eligible voters cast their votes in the election, in line with pre-election projections.

KINGSTON, New York, U.S. – The Hudson Valley Mall in Kingston, New York, U.S. is under lockdown after at least one man entered the building and opened fire. The mall is located about 90 miles north of New York City.

Police said that two people were injured. One of the victims received a serious gunshot wound in the leg. That victim, a 20-year-old Army recruiter, was taken by helicopter to an Albany hospital where doctors said the man may lose his leg. Another victim was hit in the hand by shrapnel.

Police took a 24-year-old man into custody. The suspect is currently being interviewed at the Ulster County Sheriff's Department. Police report that an assault rifle has been recovered at the mall.

Officials say that the man entered the Best Buy store and opened fire as he walked towards the entrance to the rest of the mall. When the gunman ran out of ammunition, he surrendered to a mall employee.

A Gap employee told a Fox News reporter that mall staff ordered shoppers into the back room of the store when the first shots were fired.

A shopper, Heather Craig, told CNN by phone that, when shots were fired, the numerous people filling the mall corridors were tripping over each other trying to exit the building, while some people stood dumbfounded. None of the frightened shoppers confronted the gunman before his surrender.

Officials said that the mall will not be reopened until at least Monday.
Police have locked down the mall as SWAT teams continue to search the building. 

Earlier reports said that there were as many as three gunmen but police now believe that there was only one gunman.

<h1>Brazilian Medicine Council against Cuban privileges</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Brazilian%20Medicine%20Council%20against%20Cuban%20privileges&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The Brazilian Regional Council of Medicine has protested against a Ministry of Education decision to accept the diplomas of &lt;a href="Cuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;n medical school graduates without subjecting them to a more rigorous evaluation process.

Under the Brazilian 44045 Edict of July 19, 1958, all students of Medicine, Brazilian or non-Brazilian, who studied in a foreign institution must undergo a strict evaluation before their professional registration is granted. The law aims to ensure that the physicians who graduated at foreign universities are properly prepared for and familiarized with the particular medical conditions of Brazil. Some diseases like &lt;a href="w%3Amalaria"&gt;malaria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Adengue"&gt;dengue&lt;/a&gt; for example are very rare in some countries but are more common in Brazilian territory.

However the Brazilian Ministry of Education (MEC) has come to an agreement with the Cuban government to allow medical students who studied in Cuba to go through a less rigorous examination. Furthermore the MEC wants to exempt the students from the Cuban Escola Latino Americana de Medicina (Latin American Medicine School) or ELAM located in Havana from the examination. Under the agreement, the diplomas of ELAM students would be automatically recognized as valid in Brazil. The Brazilian President &lt;a href="w%3ALuiz%20In%C3%A1cio%20Lula%20da%20Silva"&gt;Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva&lt;/a&gt; signed the endorsement of this agreement last year during his visit to Cuba.

The Brazilian Regional Council of Medicine from São Paulo is opposed to the idea of accepting the Cuban diplomas and is to dispute the deal in Court. The council says the government decision is unfair and disadvantages Brazilian students. It also says that the decision puts the Brazilian community at risk because of differences between Cuban and Brazilian medical education. Cuban physicians are prepared for Cuban conditions and necessities in health which differ from Brazilian ones. Additionally the council argues that the decision is against the law because the Brazilian 44045 Edict demands that all medical students from foreign schools have to pass a careful examination.

The Cuban First Secretary of Technical and Scientific Collaboration in Health, Filisberto Perez, recognizes that both Brazil and Cuba have different models of apprenticeship in medicine. However he believes that Cuba and Brazil can recognize each other's diplomas without difficulty.

Early this year, a team of Brazilian inspectors visited the leading medical schools in Cuba to evaluate them so the degrees can be formalized. 

The MEC's decision has angered some Brazilian students. "Why would I study for two years so I could get admitted to a Brazilian school if it would be easier to "buy" my diploma in Cuba?" asks Artur Oliveira Mendes in a email sent to a academic organization. He added: "...our schools of medicine are demoralized before the president's declaration."

The Brazilian students who are in Cuba were selected by the &lt;a href="w%3AWorkers%27%20Party%20%28Brazil%29"&gt;PT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACommunist%20Party%20of%20Brazil"&gt;PCdoB&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ALandless%20Workers%27%20Movement"&gt;MST&lt;/a&gt;. 

Senator José Agripino Maia (&lt;a href="w%3AParty%20of%20the%20Liberal%20Front%20%28Brazil%29"&gt;PFL&lt;/a&gt;) asked the Minister of Education Tarso Genro to explain before the Senate Education Commission why the students from Cuba are being favoured by the Brazilian government.

ANAPU, Pará, Brazil – 
Gunmen murdered an American &lt;a href="w%3ACatholic"&gt;Catholic&lt;/a&gt; nun, Sister Dorothy Stang, 73, in &lt;a href="w%3APar%C3%A1"&gt;Pará&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Brazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;. 

The crime occurred Saturday, Feb. 12, at 9:00 a.m. Her attackers shot Stang six times: once in the head, three times in the back, while she was carrying a Bible. Another shot, at her neck, was fatal. The crime occurred in &lt;a href="w%3AAnapu"&gt;Anapu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APar%C3%A1"&gt;Pará&lt;/a&gt;, inside the &lt;a href="w%3AAmazon%20Rainforest"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; region.

Stang is from &lt;a href="Ohio"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. She had been living in Pará for about 38 years. She came to Brazil in 1966. She is a member of the Catholic group Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur. She was an activist and had been working at the region of Anapu. Earlier this year, the missionary received an "Honorary Citizenship of the State" from the state of Para. 

Stang had been defending the Projeto de Desenvolvimento Sustentado(Project of Supported Development) or PDS for short. The Trans-Amazon development project was designed to generate jobs and income in Anapu. It supported the creation of an fruit processing industry, the construction of two small 500 kilowatt hydroelectric powerplants, and aided reforestation in degraded areas. According to Reuters, loggers, ranchers, and large farmers have been strong opponents of the project and of Stang.

Stang has already received death threats several times before. In March 2004, she asked for help from Brazilian Federal authorities, saying she and other persons were on a death list. 

On another occasion, in August 2004, she said, "It is not my safety but that of the people that really matters. All of the Sisters of Notre Dame working in Brazil work very closely with our people and want to be a sign of hope. It is wonderful to be a part of this struggle and this is the contribution of Notre Dame."

The police requested the arrest of four suspects. Two are the alleged gunfighters Eduardo and Fogoió, one is a man called Tato who supposedly contacted the gunfighters and the other one is a farmer, Vítor Miro Bastos de Moura, known as Bida who is believed to have contracted the assassins.

The Brazilian police also found a body of another man 500 meters from the place were they found the body of the nun. The murdered man was identified as the peasant Adalberto Xavier Leal, known as the Cabeludo or the Hairy Man. He was working for a farmer who had already invaded the area of the PDS maintained by sister Dorothy. 

The Brazilian police commissioner Marcelo Ferreira said the peasant was killed as a revenge for the murder of sister Dorothy. He received several shots from an armed group. According to the police the group would be connected to the missionary.

The funerals of sister Dorothy Stang will take place in Anapu and &lt;a href="w%3AAltamira"&gt;Altamira&lt;/a&gt;. She is scheduled to be buried on the morning of Feb. 16 in Anapu.

In the United States, a funeral mass is scheduled on March 19 at Mount Notre Dame Convent Chapel in &lt;a href="w%3ACincinnati"&gt;Cincinnati&lt;/a&gt;, Ohio.

The Brazilian government declared the resolution of the case a high priority. President &lt;a href="w%3ALuiz%20In%C3%A1cio%20Lula%20da%20Silva"&gt;Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva&lt;/a&gt; sent two ministers and the federal police force to the region. Eight Ministers are scheduled to have an extraordinary meeting and discuss the case.

Rosana Gisele da Costa, a friend of Stang's from the Institute of Environment Research, told reporters that there must be a more active government presence in the region. 

"Unfortunatelly this is not a isolated case", da Costa said. 

She said other people will die if the Brazilian government does not start good political development of the region. She hopes the current actions by the government after the murderer of sister Dorothy will not be temporary.

The &lt;a href="http%3A//www.met.gov.fj/"&gt;Fiji Meteorological Service&lt;/a&gt; issued a severe weather warning for &lt;a href="w%3ASamoa"&gt;Samoa&lt;/a&gt; at 0835 UTC today. Forecasters are predicting damaging gale force winds, heavy rain, squally thunderstoms and heavy seas that may cause the flooding of low-lying land in the South Pacific island of Samoa within the next 24 to 36 hours.

The intensifying tropical cyclone Olaf is following in the footsteps of cyclone Nancy and the two storms are expected to interact in some way over the next 3 to 4 days. Some predictions indicate the two storms may merge.

The 32-story &lt;a href="w%3AWindsor%20Tower"&gt;Windsor Tower&lt;/a&gt;, located in the business district of Madrid, &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, was devastated by the largest fire in the city's history.

The fire destroyed large parts of the building, completely gutting the top 14 floors. Parts of the structure collapsed during the blaze, which was extinguished on Sunday evening. 

The 106m high tower is now extremely unstable, and experts believe there is a chance it could collapse in the next 24 hours. Surrounding areas have been evacuated, traffic diverted, and trains stopped on the three subway lines beneath the building.

The fire is believed to have been started by an electrical short-circuit on the 21st floor. No-one was in the building (which was undergoing refurbishment) at the time of the blaze; the only casualties being three firefighters treated for smoke inhalation.

The top twenty floors of the building housed the &lt;a href="w%3ADeloitte"&gt;Deloitte &amp; Touche&lt;/a&gt; auditing firm. The remains will be demolished at a future date.

&lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; has rejected an offer by the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; to supply a &lt;a href="w%3ALight%20water%20reactor"&gt;light-water nuclear research reactor&lt;/a&gt;.

Iran currently plans to build a &lt;a href="w%3AHeavy%20water"&gt;heavy-water reactor&lt;/a&gt; at Arak in central in Iran, which could be used to convert uranium into plutonium, an element used to build atomic bombs. 

The reactor design being offered by the EU would demand the use of &lt;a href="w%3AEnriched%20uranium"&gt;enriched uranium&lt;/a&gt;, while a heavy-water reactor only requires natural uranium for fuel. Were Iran to take the EU reactor, their ability to use the reactor would be limited by outside supplies of enriched uranium&amp;mdash;presumably allowing better regulation of their ability to use the civilian reactor for military purposes. With a heavy-water reactor, Iran would be able to presumably use uranium from its own uranium mines, and would be less dependent on Western technology or approval.&lt;a href="http%3A//globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/iran/arak.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; According to &lt;a href="http%3A//globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/iran/mines.htm"&gt;GlobalSecurity.org&lt;/a&gt;, Iran has as many as 10 active uranium mines.

According to BBC News, Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi rejected the offer saying "We intend to turn into an important and a major player in the nuclear fuel supply market in the next 15 years because there will be an energy shortage in the future." 

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; and the EU want Iran to cease all operations that could be used to produce weapons-grade nuclear material&amp;mdash;namely uranium enrichment and the proposed heavy-water reactor operation.

A passenger ship, the ♡❤Voyager♡❤ enroute between &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABalearic%20Islands"&gt;Balearic Islands&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to the &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; island of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASardinia"&gt;Sardinia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , radioed a distress call earlier today after getting into difficulties in heavy seas. A huge wave shattered a bridge window, damaging control systems inside.

The &lt;a href="Bahamas"&gt;Bahamian&lt;/a&gt;-registered ship is carrying 776 passengers and crew, 480 of them Spanish. Some sustained minor injuries when the ship sailed into the storm at 8am &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; today. 

&lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; and Spanish tugs have been dispatched to assist the vessel, and the &lt;a href="UK"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; gas tanker ♡❤Gimi♡❤ has diverted to offer help and is relaying radio signals from the stricken ship. ♡❤Voyager♡❤ "is in a difficult situation but is not drifting", according to the French coastguard, with only a single propeller still providing force.

The ship was sailing from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATunis"&gt;Tunis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;a href="Barcelona"&gt;Barcelona&lt;/a&gt; when she encountered the storm. The crew have restored power to two of her four engines and she is now diverting to Tunis, and is expected to reach port on Tuesday.

Calgary, Alberta – 

&lt;a href="w%3AWestJet%20Airlines"&gt;WestJet Airlines&lt;/a&gt; is taking a &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20dollar"&gt;CA$&lt;/a&gt;47.6 million charge on its books to retire 18 older airplanes. They will be replaced by 16 new &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20737"&gt;737 planes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3ACalgary"&gt;Calgary&lt;/a&gt; based WestJet announced this Friday amid growing concerns about fuel prices. WestJet expects the new planes will save up to 30% more fuel. 

The decision is expected to be a major hit to their profits and short-term growth potential. "It looks like the growth curve is going to slow down and fairly substantially through this next year," independent airline analyst Rick Erickson said Friday. "I won't expect that there's going to be very much in the way of new destinations for WestJet to serve." WestJet plans on reporting year end results next Tuesday.

Electronics retailer &lt;a href="w%3ABest%20Buy"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; said today that it signed leases for 28 new stores. This is part of the company's plan to build 60 new stores this year. Best Buy, the largest consumer electronics retailer in the United States, declined to discuss the terms of the leases but did say that the new stores will result in the addition of 3,500 more jobs to the corporate payroll.

A large blast on the seafront of west &lt;a href="w%3ABeirut"&gt;Beirut&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Lebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; has killed several people, including former Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ARafik%20Hariri"&gt;Rafik Hariri&lt;/a&gt;.

Current reports conflict on the total number of casualties, suggesting nine or ten people killed and around 100 injured. Hariri was travelling in a car in a motorcade when the explosion occurred around 1pm local time. His bullet-proof car was totally destroyed. The attack took place near the luxurious Saint George hotel, in a residential neighborhood.

The cause of the blast is currently unknown for certain but it is believed to have been a car bomb. Anonymous sources have said car containing 300 kg of &lt;a href="w%3ATNT"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; was used; however other reports have suggested the explosives were placed in a building. The explosion created a crater at least 10 m across and devastated the fronts of nearby shops and hotels, destroying several buildings entirely. Apartment windows within a 1km radius were blown out.

Only one group has claimed responsibility, a little-known organisation from &lt;a href="Syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt; called Victory and Jihad in Greater Syria. There has been no confirmation that this group actually carried out the attack. Hariri's supporters see Syria as being responsible for the attack. Lately, Hariri had become a chief opponent of the Syrian military presence (14,000 troops) in Lebanon.

The &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; quotes the group has having said "We hold the Lebanese authority and the Syrian authority, being the authority of tutelage in Lebanon, responsible for this crime and other similar crimes."

Rafik Bahaa Edine Hariri (November 1, 1944–February 14, 2005) was a Lebanese self-made billionaire businessman, and was twice Prime Minister of Lebanon, before his last resignation from office on October 20, 2004.

'Baby 81', a four-month-old baby boy so named because he was the 81st admission into the hospital that day, has been confirmed to be the child of Jenita and Murugupillai Jeyarajah. He was lost during the Indian Ocean &lt;a href="w%3A2004%20Indian%20Ocean%20earthquake"&gt;tsunami&lt;/a&gt; that killed more than 228,000 people. Eight other families also claimed him to be their lost baby although no others filed a formal claim for the child.

DNA tests confirmed the Jeyarajahs as the real parents after the couple waited seven weeks for his return. The parents tried to get him back many times and were involved in a physical attempt at taking him. His father also said that he would commit suicide if authorities did not return his child.

"I am so happy, and I only have to thank God for giving my child back... We've got the results for all our hardships," Mr. Jeyarajah said after the ruling.

On Sunday, February 6, 2005 the police officer Luiz Pereira da Silva was murdered inside a &lt;a href="w%3ALandless%20Workers%27%20Movement"&gt;MST&lt;/a&gt; camp in the Brazilian city of &lt;a href="w%3AQuipap%C3%A1"&gt;Quipapá&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APernambuco"&gt;Pernambuco&lt;/a&gt;. His colleague, police officer Cícero Jacinto da Silva, was captured and tortured. Another policeman, Adílson Alves Aroeiras, escaped. This week authorities from Pernambuco said they will strengthen the investigation.

The three police officers were from the 10th Batalhão da PM (Military Police Battalion). They were travelling in an unmarked police car. Members of the MST destroyed the car with scythes, and set fire to it.

The policemen were pursuing José Ricardo de Oliveira Rodrigues. Oliveira Rodrigues is accused of assaulting banks and robbery of goods transported by vehicles in the roads of the region. He hid at the MST camp known as "Bananeiras" (Banana tree). The peasants interfered with the arrest of Oliveira Rodrigues and got into a conflict with the police. Police officer Luiz Pereira da Silva was killed by three gunshots. Police officer Cícero Jacinto da Silva was captured, and later tortured. Officer Adílson Alves escaped. The MST activists disarmed the officers and took their bulletproof vests. 

Later on Saturday (February 7, 2005), Police Commander Major Sillas Charamba negotiated the release of Jacinto da Silva. The policemen's pistols were returned, but the bulletproof vests could not be because they had been destroyed.

The MST says that the former MST leader Oliveira Rodrigues was already banished from the moviment. The MST says the peasants didn't know that the three men were policemen, that Oliveira Rodrigues deceived the other peasants, and that the policemen could not be identified as police officers. The MST say they have previously brought Oliveira Rodrigues to the attention of the police for the alleged theft of a motorcycle and beating of a woman.
&lt;a href="http%3A//www.mst.org.br/informativos/minforma/ultimas484.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The MST regional coordinator Jaime Amorim has been invited to go to the town Police Station and explain to the police that the MST has already denounced Oliveira Rodrigues. According to the Police Comissaire Antônio Carlos Câmara there are no recorded complaints concerning Oliveira Rodrigues from the MST at the police station.

The Regional Superintendent of the National Institute of Agrarian Development (Incra) in Pernambuco, Maria Oliveira, expects the arrival of a special federal task force this week (February 15, 2005). The force will assist in the disarmament of MST members from the Bananeiras camp.

The Secretariat of Social Defense of Pernambuco announced the backing of the investigations with the help of the Group of Special Operations and the Nucleus Specialized in the Verification of Multiple Homicides.

The Police requested that Incra provide more information about the MST members from Bananeiras camp, some of whom are suspected of murderer and torture, so they can be properly investigated.

Dublin – &lt;a href="Yahoo"&gt;Yahoo!&lt;/a&gt;, the internet portal, today announced it has chosen &lt;a href="w%3ADublin"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; as the location of its European Headquarters. Ireland beat off stiff competition from other European countries to win the investment. The move is expected to create over 400 jobs - two thirds of which are expected to be for graduates with skills in information technology, financial services, customer support and website editorial. 

Earlier in the month, Ireland lost a potentially multi-billion euro investment by &lt;a href="w%3ADell"&gt;Dell&lt;/a&gt; for a new manufacturing facility to &lt;a href="%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;. This was a huge disappointment for &lt;a href="w%3AIDA%20Ireland"&gt;IDA Ireland&lt;/a&gt; - the countries main development agency - which had offered heavy incentives to the US computer maker. This brought about fears that Ireland had lost its ability to attract high-value investments from foreign multinationals - the driving force of Ireland's &lt;a href="w%3ACeltic%20Tiger"&gt;Celtic Tiger&lt;/a&gt; economy.

Speaking about the investment, the Irish Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, &lt;a href="w%3AMiche%C3%A1l%20Martin"&gt;Micheál Martin&lt;/a&gt;, said winning the Yahoo project was a ♡❤"truly outstanding achievement for Ireland"♡❤. Yahoo's Senior Vice President International, &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Marcom"&gt;John Marcom&lt;/a&gt;, said the decision to locate its European operations headquarters in Ireland was influenced by a ♡❤"number of factors"♡❤ which included ♡❤"the calibre and volume of graduates available in Ireland, the up to date cost competitive telecommunications and data centre infrastructure, and the assistance of IDA Ireland."♡❤ 

Yahoo is one of the world's largest internet companies. Its decision to locate in Ireland confirms Dublin's continued attractiveness to internet and technology companies - &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABell%20Labs"&gt;Bell Labs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AEBay"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAmazon"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AOracle"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt; all have significant Irish operations.

<h1>Conservative White House reporter using pseudonym gains access to Presidential press briefing and classified documents</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Conservative%20White%20House%20reporter%20using%20pseudonym%20gains%20access%20to%20Presidential%20press%20briefing%20and%20classified%20documents&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A lack of thorough and consistent measures to pick the White House press corps members has led many to question the reason a little-known conservative reporter had access to sensitive documents and the President of the United States.

Jeff Gannon, whose real name is James Guckert, has been operating under an assumed name while attending White House press briefings. Gannon/Guckert was a reporter for the news service Talon News, a website believed by some to be a branch of the GOPUSA, up until his recent resignation due to the incidents surrounding him.

The spotlight was originally cast on Guckert when called upon in a January 26 news conference. He asked President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; how he could work with Democratic congressional leaders "who seem to have divorced themselves from reality." Bloggers, seeing this as a "softball" question almost immediately began to question Guckert’s credentials and motives.

Guckert supposedly had access to classified documents that named &lt;a href="w%3AValerie%20Plame"&gt;Valerie Plame&lt;/a&gt; as a CIA operative as well, which adds more fuel to the fire of the Justice Department’s investigation of the release of her name.

Bloggers revealed James Guckert's real name, and that he was the registered owner of JeffGannon.com, Hotmilitarystud.com, Militaryescorts.com, and Militaryescortsm4m.com.

The accusations that Guckert has no degree in journalism, reports through a small organiztion funded by a larger conservative news outlet, operated under an assumed name, and is directly linked with pornographic domain names, have many questioning how exactly he received a press pass in the first place.

White House press secretary Scott McClellan, when questioned about this event, stated that Guckert did not have a regular White House press pass but was cleared on a day-by-day basis to attend briefings and used his real name. McClellan defended Guckert’s clearance saying that, "He, like anyone else, showed that he was representing a news organization that published regularly and so he was cleared two years ago to receive daily passes just like many others are."

The Tech Beat, an online extension of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABusinessWeek"&gt;BusinessWeek&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; magazine, posted a profile of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on Tuesday. Wikinews is an &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aopen%20content"&gt;open content&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; news source run by the non-profit &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWikimedia%20Foundation"&gt;Wikimedia Foundation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The review compares Wikinews to "a cost-free &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ", noting the volunteer base of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acitizen%20journalists"&gt;citizen journalists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that collaborate in writing Wikinews articles. The Tech Beat cites the recent successes of Internet &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWeblog"&gt;blogs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as evidence that Wikinews has a bright future. 

The recent offer by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGoogle"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to host &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , an open content encyclopedia, was also mentioned to attest to the potential of Wikinews.

Wikinews was launched as a demonstration &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Awiki"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in November 2004.

New York, New York – 
On &lt;a href="w%3AFebruary%2012"&gt;February 12&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3A2005"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt;, at 8:30 a.m., New York Mayor &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Bloomberg"&gt;Michael Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt; dropped the first piece of fabric in ♡❤♡&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Gates"&gt;The Gates&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡, a &lt;a href="w%3ALand%20art"&gt;land art&lt;/a&gt; project by &lt;a href="w%3AChristo"&gt;Christo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJeanne-Claude%20Denat%20de%20Guillebon"&gt;Jeanne Claude&lt;/a&gt;.

The artists installed 7,500 metal "gates" along 23 miles of pathways in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New York City's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Park"&gt;Central Park&lt;/a&gt;. Each gate supported a flag-shaped piece of saffron fabric. The project is scheduled to run from &lt;a href="w%3AFebruary%2012%2C%202005"&gt;Feb. 12&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3A2005"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href="w%3AFebruary%2027"&gt;Feb. 27&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3A2005"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt;. The project is sometimes referred to as "♡❤The Gates♡❤, Central Park, New York, 1979-2005" in reference to the time between the artists' initial proposal and the present day.

<h2>Installation</h2>

The installation of the project began on &lt;a href="w%3AJanuary%203"&gt;January 3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3A2005"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt;.

During the week of January 17th, the park was filled with workers using fork lifts to move the rectangular metal plates into position all over Central Park.
There were small signs placed on every walkway in the park with alphanumeric codes that the workers were using to place the metal places onto the designated spots.

As of January 27, most of the plates had been placed in their positions. Many had small orange plastic markers sticking up a foot or two (around half a metre) from each end, possibly intended to help people find the base plates if they were covered with snow. A major snow storm and extreme cold hampered progress in late January.

As of February 7, there were many teams of workers wearing silver grey smocks moving the vertical parts of the gates and attaching them to the base plates. The documentation describes the color as "saffron" but local observers describe it as orange.
When attached, the vertical pieces are about 6 metres high, with a cross bar at the top from which the flag piece hangs. The most common width seems to be 11 feet (3.35 metres), though they vary considerably (depending on the width of the path) from around 6 feet (2 metres) to over 20 feet (6 metres).

<h2>Opening</h2>

Once Bloomberg released the first piece of cloth, the rest of the gates were opened over the course of the next few hours, with large crowds of people watching. Generally, the crews of people who erected the gates were assigned to open them. They simply had to walk underneath, and use a hook at the end of a long stick to pull a loop hanging from the cross bar of each gate. That opened the cloth bag which contained the "flag" part of the gate. The bag fell to the ground, along with a card board tube around which the flag was rolled. The flag then hung majestically from the cross bar.

As of &lt;a href="w%3AFebruary%2013%2C%202005"&gt;Feb. 13&lt;/a&gt;, all of the gates have been opened. The project staff is still deployed in the park, patrolling, and replacing a few of the gates that have become damaged. There are many more people then usual walking around in the park, looking and photographing ♡❤♡The Gates♡❤♡.

At &lt;a href="UCLA"&gt;UCLA&lt;/a&gt;, a team of researchers has developed a harmless version of HIV that is designed to seek out, and potentially destroy, cancer cells. 

In a laboratory-mouse experiment, the treated cells headed directly for melonoma and lung cancer cells, clustering around them with a surprising level of intuitiveness. Gene therapy for cancer has been at an impasse for the last 20 years, said the team, but now an effective carrier has been found in the most unlikely of sources. Essentially, one of the world’s largest health threats is now being considered to fight another.

Says Dr. Irvin Chen, from UCLA's AIDS Institute, "The disarmed AIDS virus acts like a Trojan horse, transporting therapeutic agents to a targeted part of the body, such as the lungs, where tumors often spread." 

First the virus's coating is removed and the virus is reprogrammed so that it recognizes and attaches to the p-lipoproteins of a cancer cell, one of cancer's primary defenses. The retro-virus was also altered with a fluorescent protein for easy tracking within the lab mice. The next step will be to graft a cancer-killing gene onto the modified AIDS virus's genetic structure. 

Currently, a case of melanoma skin cancer spreading to the lungs is a confirmed death sentence. Should this method of treatment improve into a workable treatment, both life-threatening cancers and the AIDS retro-virus could be effectively neutered. But the team cautions that the treatment is in the very early stages and will take several more years to develop.

London Mayor ♡❤♡&lt;a href="w%3AKen%20Livingstone"&gt;Ken Livingstone&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ has refused to retract a Nazi insult made to a reporter. The comments were made when Evening Standard reporter Oliver Finegold approached Mr Livingstone while he was leaving a party celebrating the 20th anniversary of Chris Smith becoming the first homosexual MP to “come out”, which he was attending as a private matter. Livingstone apparently saw the presence of the journalist as an infrigement on his private life.

Mr Livingstone is reported to have asked 'what were you before?' and then asked if Finegold was a German war criminal; he then compared the reporter to a “concentration camp guard.” 

Ken Livingstone has headed the &lt;a href="w%3AGreater%20London%20Authority"&gt;Greater London Authority&lt;/a&gt; since 2000.

Labour's Mayor is said to be “standing by” his remarks and at his weekly press conference on Tuesday ruled out an apology and said that his comments were not racist.

“If you think they are racist, I think you are wrong,” he told media representatives.

The Board of Deputies of British Jews has submitted an official complaint to the Standards Board for England which, if it decides to take action has the power to suspend or bar Mr Livingstone from office or alternatively may recommend that Mr Livingstone do something like attend race awareness meetings.

In separate moves the London Assembly passed two motions on Monday asking the Mayor to apologise for his comments. 

The Mayor has said that his comments would not affect the 2012 &lt;a href="w%3AOlympic%20Games"&gt;Olympic&lt;/a&gt; bid made to the International Olympic Council, representatives from which arrived in London on Tuesday. 

On the recording made by the reporter Mr Livingstone is heard to ask Mr Finegold if he is a “German war criminal,” to which Mr Finegold replies “No, I’m Jewish, I wasn’t a war criminal. I’m quite offended by that.”

The Mayor then went on to say “Ah right, well you might be, but actually you are just like a concentration camp guard, you are just doing it because you are paid to, aren’t you?”

ANAPU, Pará, Brazil – 
According to the Brazilian newspaper ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AO%20Estado%20de%20S%C3%A3o%20Paulo"&gt;O Estado de São Paulo&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ the body of a prominent Brazilian agriculturalist was found on the morning of Tuesday, February 15, in &lt;a href="w%3AAnapu"&gt;Anapu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APar%C3%A1"&gt;Pará&lt;/a&gt;, Brazil.

The man, identified as the agriculturist Cláudio Branco who was also known by the nickname Mato Grosso, had received several gun shots to his chest. He was found in Anapu at Gleba Manduacari, on government property controlled by the agency Incra. The area was to be used by slain sister Dorothy Stang in a new project. 

Branco's body was moved to &lt;a href="w%3AAltamira"&gt;Altamira&lt;/a&gt; for an autopsy.

According to computer security expert &lt;a href="w%3ABruce%20Schneier"&gt;Bruce Schneier&lt;/a&gt;, a widely-used cryptography &lt;a href="w%3Aalgorithm"&gt;algorithm&lt;/a&gt;, known as &lt;a href="w%3ASHA-1"&gt;SHA-1&lt;/a&gt;, has been broken by three researchers at &lt;a href="w%3AShandong%20University"&gt;Shandong University&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;. Designed by the US intelligence agency &lt;a href="w%3ANSA"&gt;NSA&lt;/a&gt;, SHA-1 has been adopted as an official US government standard and has become widely-used in security applications worldwide, notably &lt;a href="w%3Adigital%20signature"&gt;digital signature&lt;/a&gt;s. The three female researchers, Xiaoyun Wang, Yiqun Lisa Yin, and Hongbo Yu, have reduced the amount of time needed to find two documents with the same signature by a factor of more than 2000.

The SHA-1 algorithm is used to compute a short string of numbers, known as a &lt;a href="w%3ACryptographic%20hash%20function"&gt;hash&lt;/a&gt;, for any digital document. The algorithm is constructed such that small changes in the document cause the hash to change drastically. By this means, the hash can be used to verify that a document has not been tampered with.

The attack that Schneier describes is a "&lt;a href="w%3Acollision%20attack"&gt;collision attack&lt;/a&gt;," rather than the more useful "pre-image" attack. In a &lt;a href="w%3Apre-image%20attack"&gt;pre-image attack&lt;/a&gt;, the codebreaker is able to find a document with different contents that matches an existing hash and so can claim an existing signature was on something else. In the somewhat less valuable "collision attack," the &lt;a href="w%3Acodebreaker"&gt;codebreaker&lt;/a&gt; is able to devise two documents that both have some particular hash. A adversary might use this to claim that an altered document is the original on the grounds that they have the same hash. A crafty adversary might also be able to trick someone into signing an innocuous document, one of a pair from a collision. The other document, which might not be as harmless, would then also appear to have been signed by the same person. If collisions can be found for SHA-1, then digital signatures will no longer vouch for a document's authenticity.

The attack, for now, is more of a theoretical than a practical kind: it would currently take thousands of years on a modern personal computer, and would still be slow even if a large number of computers were used in parallel.

Xiaoyun Wang is currently a professor at &lt;a href="w%3AShandong%20University"&gt;Shandong University&lt;/a&gt;, while Hongbo Yu is a doctoral candidate at the same institution. Yiqun Lisa Yin is currently a visiting researcher at the Princeton Architecture Laboratory for Multimedia and Security (PALMS). Last year, Xiaoyun Wang and Hongbo Yu also took part in breaking a series of similar algorithms, including the widely used &lt;a href="w%3AMD5"&gt;MD5&lt;/a&gt; hash, as documented in their paper presented at the Crypto 2004 conference.

Officials from the &lt;a href="w%3ANIST"&gt;National Institute of Standards and Technology&lt;/a&gt; (NIST) have recently recommended dropping SHA-1 in favor of stronger, slower algorithms, such as &lt;a href="w%3ASHA-256"&gt;SHA-256&lt;/a&gt;, Federal Computer Week reported on February 7, 2005, just 7 days before Schneier announced the SHA-1 break. Despite deprecating SHA-1, William Burr, the head of NIST's security technology group, said that "SHA-1 is not broken, and there is not much reason to suspect that it will be soon."

U.S. retail-chain &lt;a href="w%3AWalmart"&gt;Wal-mart&lt;/a&gt; Stores will revise their "everyday low price" strategy at Seiyu supermarket in Japan. Seiyu's year-end loss in 2004 was 12.3 billion yen. The U.S. style low price selling did not appeal to Japanese consumers. 

Wal-Mart bought a 6.1% share of the Seiyu company in 2002. At that time, Seiyu had lost money in 3 out of the previous 5 years. Wal-Mart introduced their "everyday low price" selling method to Seiyu, with lineup such as 900 yen fleece wear or jeans imported directly from China. Sales did not grow as expected, since consumers wanted a more varied range of products rather than just cheap prices. "We will adjust our bias to low priced items, and resume selling name-brand goods our customers like to see," says CEO Masao Kiuchi. Seiyu will go back to their previous way of marketing through inserted fliers showing the daily specials, quite the opposite of Wal-Mart way.

"Google Inc. has made a proposal to host some of the content of the Wikimedia projects." This small sentence has launched a thousand rumours, and not just in the &lt;a href="w%3Ablogosphere"&gt;blogosphere&lt;/a&gt; and on &lt;a href="w%3ASlashdot"&gt;Slashdot&lt;/a&gt;, but in &lt;a href="w%3ABusinessWeek"&gt;BusinessWeek&lt;/a&gt; and on &lt;a href="w%3AABC%20News"&gt;ABC News&lt;/a&gt; as well.

The offer, as described on the on Wikimedia's , is less exciting than the speculation, however. The page simply says the board is discussing the offer, which does not require advertising, and plans to meet with Google via &lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20Relay%20Chat"&gt;IRC&lt;/a&gt; in March. 

For &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle%20Inc."&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, flush with &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;52 billion capitalization since its &lt;a href="w%3AInitial%20public%20offering"&gt;IPO&lt;/a&gt; in August 2004, an offer to host some &lt;a href="w%3AWikimedia%20Foundation"&gt;Wikimedia Foundation&lt;/a&gt; content is a small expense. For Wikimedia, a non-profit with a bandwidth appetite doubling every four months, prowling for funds is constant. 

The offer was met with howls of varying sorts, depending on where they emanated from online and business circles. &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20C.%20Dvorak"&gt;John Dvorak&lt;/a&gt; seems opposed to any such deal, and his views have traction online, judging by comments on Slashdot after a link to his column appeared there.

Equally speculative calls from the other direction say Google and Wikipedia are destined to join forces. Unnamed analysts quoted on TechWack (and re-quoted on p2pnet.net) called it a response to &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft's&lt;/a&gt; re-entry, newly powered with its Encarta content, into the search engine market.

Blogs linked Google stock deals with the rumours of a hosting deal - and with the valuable commodity of social responsibility. The Wikipedia's community run the gamut of hopes and fears as well.

That such limited facts can raise the passions of the online and the business communities to such a pitch should impress both Google and Wikipedia with their status on the internet.

The &lt;a href="http%3A//www.taxpolicycenter.org"&gt;Tax Policy Center&lt;/a&gt; has published a &lt;a href="http%3A//www.taxpolicycenter.org/TaxModel/tmdb/TMTemplate.cfm%3FDocid%3D773%26amp%3BDocTypeID%3D1"&gt;table&lt;/a&gt; that states that taxpayers earning more than $10,000,000 in 2004 paid lower tax rates than taxpayers earning between $1,000,000 and $10,000,000. Among other things, it breaks down the average tax rate by cash income into various income tax categories.

According to the Tax Policy Center, the average tax rate paid by the 9,000 taxpayers earning over $10,000,000 in 2004 was 20.1%, more than 2% lower than the nearly quarter million taxpayers earning between $1,000,000 and $10,000,000. If taxpayers earning over $10,000,000 were taxed at 22.3%, the rate of those earning between $1,000,000 and $10,000,000, the federal government would have received an additional $4.8 billion in revenue.

Taxpayers who earned more than $10,000,000 paid a lower average rate than any category of taxpayer earning over $100,000. Although taxpayers in the $75,000 to $100,000 range paid 18.9% of their income in taxes, 1.2% less than those making over $10,000,000, taxpayers in the $100,000 to $200,000 range paid an average of 20.6%, or 0.5% more than those making over $10,000,000.
Furthermore, the Tax Policy Center's analysis is described by David Cay Johnston, New York Times columnist and author of ♡❤Perfectly Legal♡❤ as "understating the real economic gains of those at the very top, who have perfectly legal ways to defer reporting income for tax purposes."

The &lt;a href="http%3A//www.taxpolicycenter.org/home/"&gt;Tax Policy Center&lt;/a&gt; is a nonpartisian joint venture of the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.urban.org/"&gt;Urban Institute&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http%3A//www.brookings.edu"&gt;Brookings Institution&lt;/a&gt; and comprised of nationally recognized experts in tax, budget, and social policy who have served at the highest levels of government.

Spain – 
The &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ASpain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9%20Luis%20Rodr%C3%ADguez%20Zapatero"&gt;José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero&lt;/a&gt; visited &lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AArgentina"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AChile"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AUruguay"&gt;Uruguay&lt;/a&gt; recently, in a effort to build a left axis in &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20America"&gt;South America&lt;/a&gt;.

The cited countries' South American Presidents agreed to collaborate at international level, particularly in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; and with &lt;a href="w%3AParis"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABerlin"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMadrid"&gt;Madrid&lt;/a&gt;.

Zapatero visited the following cities in four days: Brasilia, São Paulo, Buenos Aires and Santiago de Chile. According to official sources these visits are the last part of the project he began at the EU-Latin American Summit in Guadalajara, &lt;a href="w%3AMexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; and pursued in the IberoAmerican meeting in &lt;a href="w%3ACosta%20Rica"&gt;Costa Rica&lt;/a&gt; in November.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Google%20offers%20to%20help%20Wikipedia&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3AGoogle%20Inc."&gt;Google Inc.&lt;/a&gt; may offer hosting services to &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, a free community-built encyclopedia, and other projects hosted by the &lt;a href="w%3AWikimedia"&gt;Wikimedia Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. Preliminary talks are scheduled to continue in March. 

The steps of Google towards Wikipedia are not surprising. Google's competitors, such as Clusty.com, MSN Search, and Yahoo, already offer searching of encyclopedias as a dedicated search category. &lt;a href="http%3A//clusty.com/"&gt;Clusty.com&lt;/a&gt; offers the English Wikipedia, &lt;a href="http%3A//search.msn.com/default.aspx"&gt;MSN Search&lt;/a&gt; links to &lt;a href="w%3AEncarta"&gt;Encarta&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http%3A//yahoo.com/"&gt;Yahoo&lt;/a&gt; has access to the &lt;a href="w%3AColumbia%20Encyclopedia"&gt;Columbia Encyclopedia&lt;/a&gt;.

Wikipedia is often one of the top results of many searches. Anyone can distribute and even modify Wikipedia content in compliance with its license, called the GNU Free Documentation License. Besides attribution, the license requires that modifications are made available under the same conditions, a principle known as "copyleft" and most frequently applied to computer software such as the free operating system &lt;a href="w%3ALinux"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt;.

How would a tight Wikipedia integration into Google look? 
<ol>
BULLET::::1. A Wikipedia-specific search category like Google's Newsgroups Index &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle%20Groups"&gt;Google Groups&lt;/a&gt; that even is editable. You can subscribe to Google Groups and post a response to a message thread.
BULLET::::2. A Wikipedia-specific search category that is non-editable and links to the original project like &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle%20Category"&gt;Google Category&lt;/a&gt; that uses the Open Content &lt;a href="w%3Athe%20Open%20Directory%20Project"&gt;the Open Directory Project&lt;/a&gt;.
BULLET::::3. An inline feature that emphasizes Wikipedia results at the top of a search result. For details see &lt;a href="http%3A//www.google.com/help/features.html"&gt;Google Web Search Features&lt;/a&gt;.
</ol>
The technical side of Google hosting also leaves various possibilities:
<ol>
BULLET::::1. Google could place a daily updated mirror of Wikipedia that is Google-owned and hosted as a subdomain like news.google.com. That option could be perceived negatively by the Wikipedia users. There is already a discussion on Wikipedia how to deal with Mirrors of Wikipedia that are listed in Google search results higher than the original content. &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia%3ASend%20in%20the%20clones"&gt;Wikipedia:Send in the clones&lt;/a&gt;
BULLET::::2. Google could offer some Web servers with unlimited bandwidth for the Wikimedia Foundation without conditions. That would have benefits for both sides: Wikipedia, that is currently in the Top 200 Web sites according to Alexa.com, would have no problems with delivering the content to the users. Google could index Wikipedia content instantly and would not be restricted to the limited number of requests to index it by Google Webspiders.

</ol>
Here is an excerpt of a page about hosting posted on Wikimedia's "Meta-Wiki", which is used by the community to coordinate project organization: 

"Google Inc. have made a proposal to host some of the content of the Wikimedia projects. The terms of the offer are currently being discussed by the board. The developer committee have been informed of some of the details via email. A private IRC meeting with Google is planned for March, 2005. Please note that this agreement does not mean there is any requirement for us to include advertising on the site." &lt;a href="http%3A//meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Google_hosting"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The original summary &lt;a href="http%3A//mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/foundation-l/2005-February/002180.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was written by Angela Beesley, one of the two elected board members of the Wikimedia Foundation, which operates Wikipedia and its sister projects. According to a message posted to a public Wikimedia discussion list by the second elected trustee, Florence Nibart-Devouard, Wikipedia founder and Wikimedia president &lt;a href="w%3AJimmy%20Wales"&gt;Jimmy Wales&lt;/a&gt; met with Google founders &lt;a href="w%3ALarry%20E.%20Page"&gt;Larry Page&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASergey%20Brin"&gt;Sergey Brin&lt;/a&gt; on February 10, "who were extremely enthusiastic about the whole project." &lt;a href="http%3A//mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/foundation-l/2005-February/002185.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The &lt;a href="UK"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACountryside%20Alliance"&gt;Countryside Alliance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has lost its legal bid to keep hunting with hounds after the High Court rejected their appeal, which had been made on the grounds that the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AParliament%20Act"&gt;Parliament Act&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 1949 was invalid. The High Court rejected this, ruling that the 1949 Act was valid. This means hunting with dogs for foxes, hares and badgers will be illegal from Friday 18 February in &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Wales"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt; in accordance with the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHunting%20Act%202004"&gt;Hunting Act 2004&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The Countryside Alliance has said it is challenging the decision in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20of%20Lords"&gt;House of Lords&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (the highest court in English Law) and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Court%20of%20Human%20Rights"&gt;European Court of Human Rights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

However the CA as said that the police would have difficulty in policing the law. The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALeague%20Against%20Cruel%20Sports"&gt;League Against Cruel Sports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has said it is setting up a “crimewatch service” to police the ban.

<h1>Study claims to show difference between male and female brains</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Study%20claims%20to%20show%20difference%20between%20male%20and%20female%20brains&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
Michael Gurian, &lt;a href="w%3Apsychologist"&gt;psychologist&lt;/a&gt; and author of "♡❤What Could He Be Thinking?♡❤", has claimed to identify approximately one hundred structural differences between male and female brains in a recent study. Gurian comments:

One major structural difference that Gurian has made clear is that males generally have more activity in the mechanical centers of the brain, while women have more activity in centers of the brain dedicated to verbal communication and emotion. A clear example of this is the hypothetical situation of giving a child a toy. He explains it as such:

Another expert, Dr. Marianne Legato, says it all boils down to &lt;a href="w%3Agenetics"&gt;genetics&lt;/a&gt;, noting that the &lt;a href="w%3AY%20chromosome"&gt;Y chromosome&lt;/a&gt; (which only males carry) has "at least 21 unique genes unique to males which control many of the body's operations down to the level of the cells."

Gurian agrees that culture is significant in brain development, but argues that biology plays an equally important role. He makes a point of how the MRI scans show that the female &lt;a href="w%3Acorpus%20callosum"&gt;corpus callosum&lt;/a&gt;, the center of the brain which regulates communication between the brain's hemispheres, is larger than the male's. On the other hand, the scans also show that information flows more freely between the hemispheres of the male brain. 

The exact role that brain structure plays in behavior, however, has been an area of considerable contention in science for literally hundreds of years. Early studies in &lt;a href="w%3Acraniometry"&gt;craniometry&lt;/a&gt; conducted by &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Pierre%20Broca"&gt;Paul Pierre Broca&lt;/a&gt; were used to attempt to distinguish differences between human races, though have now been dismissed as &lt;a href="w%3Ascientific%20racism"&gt;scientific racism&lt;/a&gt;. The nature-nurture debate has raged for centuries in a variety of forms, without yet any clear resolution as to the role in which innate biological tendencies interact with environmental conditions or willed behavior. As such, studies relating to brain structure and claims to innate behavior often generate substantial controversy.

&lt;a href="w%3AMIT"&gt;MIT&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aanthropologist"&gt;anthropologist&lt;/a&gt; of science &lt;a href="http%3A//symptom.mit.edu/"&gt;Joseph Dumit's&lt;/a&gt; study of brain imaging in his book ♡❤&lt;a href="http%3A//symptom.mit.edu/dumit/books/PicturingPersonhood.html"&gt;Picturing Personhood: Brain Scans and Biomedical Identity&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, noted that the apparent "transparency" of such pictures (the appearance that they can be easily interpreted by laymen, when they are often the source of ambiguity and dispute by even highly-trained neurosurgeons) has led to their proliferation as indicators of objective truth in media and in courts of law, and that such conclusions are often knowingly exaggerated by the specialists creating the images for better visual effect. 

The timing of Gurian's book comes on the heels of another controversy over gender differences sparked by &lt;a href="http%3A//www.president.harvard.edu/speeches/2005/nber.html"&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt; made by &lt;a href="w%3AHarvard"&gt;Harvard&lt;/a&gt; president &lt;a href="w%3ALawrence%20Summers"&gt;Lawrence Summers&lt;/a&gt;, who blamed low numbers of women in the sciences on genetic differences. Summers has been criticized by a large number of academics and scientists, as well as by many news publications, in the wake of what he was reported as saying during a conference on January 14.
