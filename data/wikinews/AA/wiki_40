&lt;a href="w%3AStanford%20University"&gt;Stanford&lt;/a&gt; biochemist &lt;a href="w%3AArthur%20Kornberg"&gt;Arthur Kornberg&lt;/a&gt;, winner of the 1959 &lt;a href="w%3ANobel%20Prize%20in%20Physiology%20or%20Medicine"&gt;Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, died on October 26, 2007 of respiratory failure. He was 89. He is survived by his third wife, Carolyn Frey Dixon.

Kornberg is best known for his discovery (with &lt;a href="w%3ASevero%20Ochoa"&gt;Severo Ochoa&lt;/a&gt;) of "the mechanisms in the biological synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid (&lt;a href="w%3ADNA"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt;)", including the isolation of &lt;a href="w%3ADNA%20polymerase%20I"&gt;DNA polymerase I&lt;/a&gt;, which led to his Nobel prize. He was the first scientist to make DNA in a test tube. He also studied pathways for synthesis of &lt;a href="w%3AAdenosine%20triphosphate"&gt;ATP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Anucleotide"&gt;nucleotides&lt;/a&gt;, and he was the first to synthesize &lt;a href="w%3APhosphoribosyl%20pyrophosphate"&gt;PRPP&lt;/a&gt;. In his later years, Kornberg studied inorganic &lt;a href="w%3Apolyphosphate"&gt;polyphosphates&lt;/a&gt;.

Kornberg's son, Stanford &lt;a href="w%3AStructural%20biology"&gt;structural biologist&lt;/a&gt; Roger D. Kornberg, won the 2006 &lt;a href="w%3ANobel%20Prize%20in%20Chemistry"&gt;Nobel Prize in Chemistry&lt;/a&gt; for work on the molecular basis of &lt;a href="w%3Aeukaryotic%20transcription"&gt;eukaryotic transcription&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>Edmund White on writing, incest, life and Larry Kramer</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Edmund%20White%20on%20writing%2C%20incest%2C%20life%20and%20Larry%20Kramer&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
What you are about to read is an American life as lived by renowned author &lt;a href="w%3AEdmund%20White"&gt;Edmund White&lt;/a&gt;. His life has been a crossroads, the fulcrum of high-brow &lt;a href="w%3AClassicism"&gt;Classicism&lt;/a&gt; and low-brow &lt;a href="w%3ABrett%20Easton%20Ellis"&gt;Brett Easton Ellisism&lt;/a&gt;. It is not for the faint. He has been the toast of the literary elite in New York, London and Paris, befriending artistic luminaries such as &lt;a href="w%3ASalman%20Rushdie"&gt;Salman Rushdie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASir%20Ian%20McKellen"&gt;Sir Ian McKellen&lt;/a&gt; while writing about a family where he was jealous his sister was having sex with his father as he fought off his mother's amorous pursuit. 

The fact is, Edmund White exists. His life exists. To the casual reader, they may find it disquieting that someone like his father existed in 1950's America and that White's work is the progeny of his intimate effort to understand his own experience. 

♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reporter understood that an interview with Edmund White, who is professor of creative writing at &lt;a href="w%3APrinceton%20University"&gt;Princeton University&lt;/a&gt;, who wrote the seminal biography of &lt;a href="w%3AJean%20Genet"&gt;Jean Genet&lt;/a&gt;, and who no longer can keep track of how many sex partners he has encountered, meant nothing would be off limits. Nothing was. Late in the interview they were joined by his partner Michael Caroll, who discussed White's enduring feud with influential writer and activist &lt;a href="w%3ALarry%20Kramer"&gt;Larry Kramer&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>On literature</h2>
♡❤♡David Shankbone: What questions are you tired of answering?
♡❤♡DS: Have you noticed your answers change much?
♡❤♡DS: When you notice you are very flexible in your thought and change notions easily, does it have broader implications for you?
♡❤♡DS: One interview I did was with a young novelist named &lt;a href="John%20Reed%20on%20Orwell%2C%20God%2C%20self-destruction%20and%20the%20future%20of%20writing"&gt;John Reed&lt;/a&gt;—
♡❤♡DS: Yes, married, kids. But he feels a problem with creating a new generation of readers today is that the literary canon does not have many modern works at the grade school and high school level, and young readers feel disconnected from reading.
♡❤♡DS: But what’s taught is not modern—
♡❤♡DS: Augusten Burroughs is taught?
♡❤♡DS: That would seem like racy material for grade school or high school.

<h2>On work as a gay writer</h2>
♡❤♡DS: Does it bother you to be considered a gay writer?
♡❤♡DS: And you embrace that?
♡❤♡DS: In England you have kids reading Afro-Caribbean literature because they don’t have a sense that it’s a “black thing”?
♡❤♡DS: Do you see a generation that can assume the mantle for the Violet Quill or is there not a necessity for it?
♡❤♡DS: Why?
♡❤♡DS: What is a gay novel?
♡❤♡DS: Would &lt;a href="w%3AAlan%20Hollinghurst"&gt;Hollinghurst&lt;/a&gt;’s ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Swimming%20Pool%20Library"&gt;Swimming Pool Library&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ be one?
♡❤♡DS: You think that’s because of a lack of a community of writers?
♡❤♡DS: Earlier you were saying what makes a book a certain genre is a marketing function.
♡❤♡DS: Who are some good gay writers?

<h2>On sex</h2>
♡❤♡DS: You said in an interview that the smartest people are the best sex—
♡❤♡DS: —what is sex to you?
♡❤♡DS: How can something repeated so often still be considered sacred?
♡❤♡DS: Do you only have sex once a week?
♡❤♡DS: People don’t go to mass every day, typically.
♡❤♡DS: They could.
♡❤♡DS: Is that the main criterion for a partner?
♡❤♡DS: You have an open relationship?
♡❤♡DS: Do you think that’s a necessity in order to have a successful relationship?
♡❤♡DS: Where do you tend to find your sexual partners?
♡❤♡DS: Are you a &lt;a href="w%3ASlave%20%28BDSM%29"&gt;slave&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="w%3AMaster%20%28BDSM%29"&gt;master&lt;/a&gt;?
♡❤♡DS: Why are you a bad slave?
♡❤♡DS: At what point does it start to seem ridiculous?
♡❤♡DS: [Laughs]
♡❤♡DS: Are you always &lt;a href="w%3ATop%20and%20bottom%20in%20sex%20and%20BDSM"&gt;submissive&lt;/a&gt;?
♡❤♡DS: You had a &lt;a href="w%3AMaster/slave%20%28BDSM%29"&gt;slave relationship&lt;/a&gt;.
♡❤♡DS: What was that like?
♡❤♡DS: What psychological issues come out in a relationship like that?
♡❤♡DS: To give up the feeling they always have to be in control in their waking lives?
♡❤♡DS: That must have been disappointing for him. 
♡❤♡DS: What psychological issues did you work through in your slave-master relationships?
♡❤♡DS: Did it used to be more so?
♡❤♡DS: Like they are wearing Halloween costumes?
♡❤♡DS: As if the fashion never changes? It’s always the same chaps, the same harness…

<h2>On incest in his family</h2>
♡❤♡DS: In an interview you said that you are known for the &lt;a href="w%3AIncest"&gt;incestuous&lt;/a&gt; feelings that were in your family—
♡❤♡DS: —what advice would you give to couples pursuing an incestuous relationship?
♡❤♡DS: Or a brother and sister.
♡❤♡DS: Do you think there is a problem with it?
♡❤♡DS: Is that because there is an intrinsic problem with it, or because of societal reactions to it?
♡❤♡DS: So you’d advise an incestuous couple not to pursue it?
♡❤♡DS: You had mentioned particular issues about a father may arise in a slave-master relationship. You were sexually attracted to your father, so do you think you worked through your own issues with him?

♡❤♡DS: Where do you think that attraction came from?
♡❤♡DS: But that’s something people could perhaps explain more readily than attraction to one's &lt;a href="w%3AFather"&gt;father&lt;/a&gt;.
♡❤♡DS: What you describe is power; are you still attracted to power?
♡❤♡DS: Would you let him blow you?
♡❤♡DS: Why not?
♡❤♡DS: What did your father’s incestuous relationship with your sister do to you?
♡❤♡DS: Did you try?
♡❤♡DS: And he spurned you?
♡❤♡DS: How would you respond?
♡❤♡DS: Did he ever know?
♡❤♡DS: What was his reaction?
♡❤♡DS: Your mother was attracted to you, right?
♡❤♡DS: [♡❤Laughs♡❤] The old doorknob adage? [♡❤Laughs♡❤]
♡❤♡DS: Do you think that played a role in your being gay?
♡❤♡DS: I &lt;a href="Dr.%20Joseph%20Merlino%20on%20sexuality%2C%20insanity%2C%20Freud%2C%20fetishes%20and%20apathy"&gt;interviewed an eminent psychoanalyst named Joseph Merlino&lt;/a&gt; and he said it’s a mixture of things—nature, nurture, both.
♡❤♡DS: How so?
♡❤♡DS: The courting rituals are similar between gays and straights.

<h2>On American politics</h2>
♡❤♡DS: Who are you supporting for President?
♡❤♡DS: Would we benefit from having Bill Clinton back in the White House?
♡❤♡DS: &lt;a href="w%3ANicolas%20Sarkozy"&gt;Nicolas Sarkozy&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href="w%3AFascism"&gt;fascist&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3ALiberator"&gt;liberator&lt;/a&gt;?
♡❤♡DS: So you have no issue with him?
♡❤♡DS: How has the &lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20War"&gt;Iraq War&lt;/a&gt; affected you?’
♡❤♡DS: &lt;a href="ACLU%20President%20Strossen%20on%20religion%2C%20drugs%2C%20guns%20and%20impeaching%20George%20Bush"&gt;Nadine Strossen is such a believer&lt;/a&gt;. I guess you need to be a believer to be President of the ACLU. What trait do you deplore in yourself?
♡❤♡DS: You have to choose whether to blow up &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, and if you do not choose then they both go. They are roughly equal in population according to their last censuses; which do you choose?
♡❤♡DS: So is China.
♡❤♡DS: It’s more cohesive now, but China, once the &lt;a href="w%3AChinese%20Communist%20Party"&gt;Communist Party&lt;/a&gt; loses its grip on power, it’s going to fall apart.
♡❤♡DS: You have &lt;a href="w%3AIslam%20in%20China"&gt;Muslim provinces&lt;/a&gt;, you have Tibet. You have problems in the south with the north. &lt;a href="w%3AHong%20Kong"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt;. You don’t think that there will be a domino effect that when one goes, the others will go?
♡❤♡DS: So the age of the end of the empire won’t touch China? It won’t be a &lt;a href="w%3ASoviet%20Union"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;?

<h2>On his intimate relationships</h2>
♡❤♡DS: What do you regard as the lowest depth of misery?
♡❤♡DS: Why did he drop you?
♡❤♡DS: How does having a relationship like that fit in yours and Michael’s?
♡❤♡DS: Do you think not articulating it is what makes it work?
♡❤♡DS: Do you always practice safe sex?
♡❤♡DS: But there’s different strains of the virus, correct?
♡❤♡DS: You’ve never known of anyone who has said, “Oh, now I have a different strain and none of the drugs are working.”
♡❤♡DS: What difficulties have you encountered physically from being HIV positive? Has it been a difficult row to hoe?
♡❤♡DS: Why did you start?

<h2>On Edmund White</h2>
♡❤♡DS: How would you like to die if you could choose your own death?
♡❤♡DS: What about dying consciously makes you uncomfortable?
♡❤♡DS: You could be hit by a train.
♡❤♡DS: Do you believe in a higher power?

♡❤♡DS: If you’re going to sin, you’re going to fuck the devil?
♡❤♡DS: What’s your favorite curse word?
♡❤♡DS: Have you ever altered your opinion of somebody based upon their star sign?
♡❤♡DS: What would you find a bigger turn-off in bed: somebody who was flatulent or somebody who spoke in a baby voice?
♡❤♡DS: Is that one especially repellent to you?
♡❤♡DS: What trait do you deplore in other people?
♡❤♡DS: What do you value most in your friends.

<h2>On Larry Kramer</h2>
♡❤♡DS: What role do you think you play in the gay community?
♡❤♡DS: Do you have a relationship with &lt;a href="w%3ALarry%20Kramer"&gt;Larry Kramer&lt;/a&gt; at all?
♡❤♡DS: Why?
♡❤♡DS: What did he say?
♡❤♡DS: But up until then—before that, you had been…
♡❤♡DS: Why were you so vulnerable?

A 1.5m &lt;a href="w%3Atidal%20surge"&gt;tidal surge&lt;/a&gt; is expected tonight in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; and could lead to flooding on the &lt;a href="w%3AKent"&gt;Kent&lt;/a&gt; coast, according to the UK &lt;a href="w%3AMet%20Office"&gt;Met Office&lt;/a&gt;. The surge is expected to cause "severe" flooding and the &lt;a href="w%3AThames%20Barrier"&gt;Thames Barrier&lt;/a&gt; was closed at 2000 UTC. The &lt;a href="w%3AEnvironment%20Agency"&gt;Environment Agency&lt;/a&gt; have said that there is "extreme danger to life and property" and have evacuated 200 people on the coast. 1,300 properties are thought to be in the affected area.

The Environment agency representative said that they would have extra staff available to inform the public of the risks but are also asking people to check that others are aware of the potential risks, especially to the elderly.

The surge has been caused by the high wind speeds of over 80 &lt;a href="w%3Amiles%20per%20hour"&gt;miles per hour&lt;/a&gt;, and could be over hurricane force, high tides and low pressure over the &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Sea"&gt;North Sea&lt;/a&gt;. There are currently 42 flood warnings of various degrees, eight of which are rated severe.

North Sea oil platforms are being evacuated in advance of the storm. &lt;a href="w%3ABP"&gt;BP&lt;/a&gt; is expecting to shut down the production on its North Sea oil platforms on Thursday. At the same time, &lt;a href="w%3AConoco%20Inc."&gt;Conoco Inc.&lt;/a&gt; has announced, that they will evacuate around 500 staff oil from platforms at the &lt;a href="w%3AEkofisk%20oil%20field"&gt;Ekofisk oil field&lt;/a&gt;. 

The &lt;a href="w%3AMETAR%20%28message%20d%E2%80%99observation%20m%C3%A9t%C3%A9orologique%20r%C3%A9guli%C3%A8re%20pour%20l%E2%80%99aviation%29"&gt;METAR&lt;/a&gt; reports from Ekofisk Oil Platform are indicating continuously intensifying winds. At 11:50 UTC on Thursday, wind gusts of 57 &lt;a href="w%3AKnot%20%28speed%29"&gt;knots&lt;/a&gt; were reported

A group, calling itself the Political-Military Council of the &lt;a href="w%3AKosovo%20Liberation%20Army"&gt;Kosovo Liberation Army&lt;/a&gt; (UCK) says it was behind yesterday's armed clash with &lt;a href="Macedonia"&gt;Macedonia&lt;/a&gt;n police forces which left at least six dead. 

In a statement, the organization claims that its members, formerly of the “&lt;a href="Albania"&gt;Albania&lt;/a&gt;n Territorial Liberation Army“, had been "forced to assemble a regular military unit in order to protect the endangered Albanian people, and every inch of Albanian territory.“ 

This Thursday, the situation in the &lt;a href="w%3ATetovo"&gt;Tetovo&lt;/a&gt; region village, the scene of yesterday's battle, is calm.

<h1>BBC Resources sale could be unprofitable</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=BBC%20Resources%20sale%20could%20be%20unprofitable&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The sale of the &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; subsidiary &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20Resources"&gt;BBC Resources Ltd&lt;/a&gt;., has hit a hurdle after it emerged that the BBC could be left with a loss of up to &lt;a href="w%3APound%20sterling"&gt;£&lt;/a&gt;15 million on the deal. The cost of transferring the pensions of BBC Resources staff from the BBC pension scheme to its new owners could be up to £50 million according to a &lt;a href="w%3AGuardian%20Newspaper"&gt;Guardian Newspaper&lt;/a&gt; report.

Managers from the division will meet with union representatives from &lt;a href="w%3ABroadcasting%2C%20Entertainment%2C%20Cinematograph%20and%20Theatre%20Union"&gt;BECTU&lt;/a&gt; on Monday to discuss this and related sale issues. BECTU general secretary, Gerry Morrissey is quoted as saying: "If the BBC gets less than £50 million for BBC Resources then how can it fulfil ♡❤[sic]♡❤ its duty of care to &lt;a href="w%3ATelevision%20licensing%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom"&gt;licence fee&lt;/a&gt; payers?"

It is believed that the BBC had hoped that a surplus in its &lt;a href="w%3Apension%20fund"&gt;pension fund&lt;/a&gt; could be used to bridge the possible £50 million gap — but the trustees of the fund have said "no". A BBC source said: "This is being discussed at the highest level".

Since April 2004 members of the BBC pension scheme have seen their contributions into it increase regularly, the BBC — like many other employers — having reduced its contribution (to 4.5% of payroll) over a ten year period when the &lt;a href="w%3Astock%20market"&gt;stock market&lt;/a&gt; was booming in the 1990s.

The Guardian is seen as a reliable source on BBC matters, having reported the proposed sale of &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20Television%20Centre"&gt;BBC Television Centre&lt;/a&gt; back in January 2007, with the formal announcement finally being made by &lt;a href="w%3ADirector-General%20of%20the%20BBC"&gt;BBC Director General&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Thompson"&gt;Mark Thompson&lt;/a&gt; on October 18, 2007.

<h3>Background to the Resources sale</h3>

The Resources business-to-business unit was formed in 1998 and operates television studios, post-production and outside broadcast facilities for it's parent share-holding company, the BBC. It does not own any studios or premises, its assets being staff and equipment.

Advertised for sale on 16th August in the &lt;a href="w%3AFinancial%20Times"&gt;Financial Times&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Times"&gt;The Times&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABroadcast%20magazine"&gt;Broadcast&lt;/a&gt; and last year making profits of £5.2 million with a revenue of £126 million, the disposal — led by &lt;a href="w%3AErnst%20%26amp%3B%20Young"&gt;Ernst &amp; Young&lt;/a&gt; — invited expressions of interest for the whole division or for each of its three operations separately. The BBC has yet to release the names of the short-listed companies. 

BBC Resources was the first of the BBC's commercial business-to-business divisions to be set up as a limited company and will be the last to be sold, the BBC having previously divested itself of BBC Technology and &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20Broadcast"&gt;BBC Broadcast&lt;/a&gt; — &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20Worldwide"&gt;BBC Worldwide&lt;/a&gt;, formerly BBC Enterprises, will remain in-house as it earns revenue from the archive, media and licensing of products — in the year to 31 March 2007 Worldwide had a turnover of £810.4 million, generating profits of £111 million.

The BBC wants to use any money raised to be put into international commercial expansion and content, most probably through Worldwide.

It had been intended to float Resources back in 2005, but this was postponed for two years following strike action and &lt;a href="w%3AAdvisory%2C%20Conciliation%20and%20Arbitration%20Service"&gt;ACAS&lt;/a&gt; talks in June 2005 — the BBC giving an undertaking that there would be no preparations made to sell the company until January 2007, and no sale allowed before July of this year. The current time-scale would see its disposal by the end of the current financial year in March 2008.

Batters overpower pitchers on this the second day of 2007 BWC. &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Chinese Taipei&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; easily won by &lt;a href="w%3AMercy_rule%23Baseball_and_softball"&gt;ending early&lt;/a&gt; the games against their opponents as their aggressive hitting made it look like batting practice.

<h2>&lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt; vs &lt;a href="Venezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;</h2>
With both pitchers shutting down their opponents' batting, it quickly became a pitching duel. Through the 6th inning, a 0-0 double shutout was still holding. But at the top of 7th inning, with Kim Joo Chan's solo &lt;a href="w%3AHome%20run"&gt;HR&lt;/a&gt; and Lee Seung Hwa's 2 runs HR to break the tie. With further effective batting, Korea went on to beat Venezuela with a final score of 4-0.

<h2>&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt; vs &lt;a href="Panama"&gt;Panama&lt;/a&gt;</h2>
Last night, assisted by Mexico's &lt;a href="w%3Aerror%20%28baseball%29"&gt;errors&lt;/a&gt; and some key hits, USA defeated Mexico with 3-0. Today, the Americans faced Panama, who beat Spain, 5-0, in yesterday's opening match. Starting pitcher, Matt Wright, and relief pitchers, Chris Perez and Jeff Stevens, effectively closed down Panama's offense. USA scored 4 runs in the first two innings and went on to a comfortable victory at 7-0.

<h2>&lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; vs &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;</h2>
Australia was defeated in extra innings by Cuba's 2 HRs, yesterday, even though the Aussies had the lead in the 9th. However, the Netherlands should not be overlooked. Evenly matched, it became a pitching game like Korea vs Venezuela did earlier. By the 6th inning, the teams were tied 2-2. The game was decided in the 9th inning. The Netherlands scored first in the top half, but in the bottom of the inning, the Dutch committed fielding errors. Australian player Trent Oeltjen secured the game, 4-3, for the Aussies by driving in the game-winning run.

<h2>Deadly shooting at high school in Finland</h2>
Eight people have been killed in a school shooting in Jokela, Finland according to an official police briefing. The victims are five male students and two female students and the principal of the Jokela High School. At least 12 people were injured from glass and other injuries during evacuation, but are not in serious danger. Besides the eight that perished, only one other person has been reported to have received a gunshot wound, but is also reported to be out of serious danger.

At a news conference at 18:00 EET (UTC+2), police said that they arrested the shooter after a siege situation at the Jokela School Centre. The shooter is said to be an 18-year-old male student, named as Pekka-Eric Auvinen, who attended the school.

The police say that the shooter had probably shot himself at some point in an apparent suicide attempt. He died at nearby Töölö Hospital at 22:14 EET. The police confirmed that they had not used weapons during the incident.

<h2>Illegal drug found to be used in the manufacture of toys</h2>
Bindeez beads, a children's toy from Australia and manufactured by Moose Enterprise in Hong Kong, is being pulled off toy store shelves in the United Kingdom after traces of an illegal drug, which is converted into gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) when ingested, was found inside the toy. At least 20 million toys are affected.

So far at least three children from the U.K. and at least two from Auckland, New Zealand have fallen seriously ill and are currently receiving medical attention. The toy is also sold in the United States as Aqua Dots with several illnesses reported.

The toy was recently named Australia's number one toy for 2007.

<h2>Albanian group claims responsibility for Macedonia clashes</h2>

A group, calling itself the Political-Military Council of the Kosovo Liberation Army (UCK) says it was behind yesterday's armed clash with Macedonian police forces which left at least six dead.

In a statement, the organization claims that its members, formerly of the “Albanian Territorial Liberation Army“, had been "forced to assemble a regular military unit in order to protect the endangered Albanian people, and every inch of Albanian territory.“

This Thursday, the situation in the Tetovo region village, the scene of yesterday's battle, is calm.

<h2>New Zealand police blocked from laying terrorism charges</h2>

Following dozens of raids across New Zealand a few weeks ago, the Solicitor General has advised the Police Commissioner, Howard Broad, the New Zealand Police will not lay charges against those arrested under the Terrorism Suppression Act 2002.

On October 15, when the raids occurred, 17 people were arrested and twelve of those were referred from the police to the Solicitor General, David Collins QC, to lay charges under the Terrorism Suppression Act. His consent was needed to lay charges relating to the act. Those arrested were charged with breaching the Firearms Act, however.

Mr Collins came to his decision due to insufficient evidence that there was planning or preparation of a terrorist act of any kind by those activist groups raided, and that the Terrorism Suppression Act is "complex and incoherent"

&lt;a href="w%3AKonami%20Cup%20Asia%20Series%202007"&gt;Konami Cup Asia Series 2007&lt;/a&gt; battled in Tokyo Dome today, with 2007 BWC in &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; and upcoming 2007 Asian Baseball Championship chained on the qualification of 2008 Summer Olympics, this series may varied Asian's teams recently.
<h2>Uni-President Lions (Taiwan) vs China Stars (China)</h2>
An alternative Cross-Strait battle became the routine Opening Match in the Konami Cup. For the Uni Lions, they have more actual strength than La New Bears of last year, and they try to win back title to Taiwan. In the &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;'s way, due to the upcoming of 2008 Olympics, their players want to show their strength at this game.

Even though the starting pitcher Nelson Figueroa couldn't press China's batting with 1-4 behind before the 6th inning, with a Grand Slam HR by Chen Lien-hung and a back-to-back HR by Yang Sen, Uni Lions finally reversed China Stars with 9-5 by 3 HRs.
<h2>SK Wyverns (South Korea) vs Chunichi Dragons (Japan)</h2>
Evidentially, Dragons didn't take any advantages at their home. Instead of SK, they scored 5 RBIs at 6th and 7th innings and finally won Dragons with 6-3 even though Yung Chun Cho was hit by Kazuki Inoue's 2 RBIs HR at the bottom of 7th inning.

Pekka-Eric Auvinen, the gunman who killed eight people in the &lt;a href="w%3AJokela%20school%20shooting"&gt;Jokela school shooting&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Finland"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, has died in hospital from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.

"He died at 22h14 of a one-bullet injury in the head," said traumatology physician Eero Hirvensalo, chief of the Helsinki University Hospital.

Auvinen, 18, murdered his headmistress, school nurse and six students, as well as wounding one other victim, before turning his gun on himself.

When police &lt;a href="w%3AOsasto%20Karhu"&gt;special units&lt;/a&gt; arrived on-scene and entered the school they were initially shot at, but when they reached Auvinen he was already unconscious, and no rounds were fired by the police.

Auvinen had no previous criminal convictions, and had received his gun license several weeks previously. He purchased his gun on October 19.

In a text describing himself on the video sharing site &lt;a href="w%3AYouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, where he had posted a total of 89 videos, including some showing him firing his gun and others directly referring to the killing, he said that he was "a cynical existentialist, anti-human humanist, anti-social social-Darwinist, realistic idealist and god-like atheist."

"I am prepared to fight and die for my cause," he continued. "I, as a natural selector, will eliminate all who I see unfit, disgraces of human race and failures of natural selection."

Queues have started to form today outside the &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Apple"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; store for the launch of the &lt;a href="w%3AiPhone"&gt;iPhone&lt;/a&gt;. The phone launches tomorrow at 6.02 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt; exclusively onto the &lt;a href="w%3AO2"&gt;O2&lt;/a&gt; network amid controversy. The iPhone was launched five months ago in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and is set to launch in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; tomorrow.

Many people have braved the poor weather and have set up camp in the street in a bid to be the first of many thousands to buy the product on the first day of it's release in the UK. Apple have already sold 1.4 million of the units in the US, some of which have already been imported into the UK un-officially. The cost of the device is set as &lt;a href="w%3APound%20sterling"&gt;£&lt;/a&gt;269 on a minimum £35 per month contract and will be sold at &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Carphone%20Warehouse"&gt;The Carphone Warehouse&lt;/a&gt;, O2 and &lt;a href="w%3AApple%20Store%20%28retail%29"&gt;Apple Stores&lt;/a&gt; across the UK.

The iPhone has a touch screen display and can act as a phone, text device, web browser, music player and email client all in one. The launch of the product onto one phone network only has caused controversy internationally and has led to many people using free and paid methods of unlocking the phone to be able to use it on other networks even though it voids the warranty. Apple replied to this move by releasing software patches that, when installed, will prevent functionality of the phone.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Delaware%20scientists%20create%20shortest%20ever%20metal%20to%20metal%20bond&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Chemists from the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Delaware"&gt;University of Delaware&lt;/a&gt;, Newark, in collaboration with the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Wisconsin"&gt;University of Wisconsin-Madison&lt;/a&gt;, recently reported their preparation of a &lt;a href="w%3Acomplex%20%28chemistry%29"&gt;complex&lt;/a&gt; containing two &lt;a href="w%3Achromium"&gt;chromium&lt;/a&gt; atoms connected by the shortest ever metal-metal bond, 1.8028 &lt;a href="w%3A%C3%85ngstr%C3%B6m"&gt;Å&lt;/a&gt; (0.2 &lt;a href="w%3ANanometre"&gt;nm&lt;/a&gt;) long. 1 Å is 1&amp;times;10 meters or 1/10,000,000,000 meters. The scientists, including Prof. Klaus H. Theopold and graduate student Kevin A. Kreisel, believe the compound contains a &lt;a href="w%3Aquintuple%20bond"&gt;quintuple bond&lt;/a&gt;, i.e., five bonds between the two chromium atoms.

In general, shorter bonds containing more electrons will be stronger. Although single, double and triple bonds occur in nature, quadruple and quintuple bonds have so far only been found in the laboratory. The first compound with a quintuple bond was reported in 2005. 

To make the complex, the scientists first reacted &lt;a href="w%3Achromium%28III%29%20chloride"&gt;chromium chloride&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href="w%3ADiketimine"&gt;bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)diazadiene&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aligand"&gt;ligand&lt;/a&gt;, which has the structure Ar-N=C-C=N-Ar (Ar is a bulky &lt;a href="w%3Aaryl"&gt;aryl&lt;/a&gt; group). This intermediate dark-green compound was then &lt;a href="w%3ARedox"&gt;reduced&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href="w%3AGraphite%20intercalation%20compound"&gt;KC&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3Apotassium"&gt;potassium&lt;/a&gt; metal in &lt;a href="w%3Agraphite"&gt;graphite&lt;/a&gt;) to give the unusual product. The compound crystallises from &lt;a href="w%3Adiethyl%20ether"&gt;ether&lt;/a&gt; as red/green plates. The quintuple bond between the metals is weakened by some mixing in from &lt;a href="w%3Aantibonding"&gt;antibonding&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Amolecular%20orbital"&gt;orbital&lt;/a&gt;s, reducing the overall &lt;a href="w%3Abond%20order"&gt;bond order&lt;/a&gt; to around 4.28. The bond length is 0.026 Å shorter than the previous record, a dichromium complex reported in 1978 by &lt;a href="w%3AF.%20Albert%20Cotton"&gt;F. Albert Cotton&lt;/a&gt; and coworkers, which featured a &lt;a href="w%3Aquadruple%20bond"&gt;quadruple bond&lt;/a&gt; 1.828 Å long.

Thursday, November 8, two &lt;a href="w%3Atrade%20fair"&gt;trade shows&lt;/a&gt;, named ♡❤MEDIPHAR Taipei♡❤ at the &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20World%20Trade%20Center"&gt;Taipei World Trade Center&lt;/a&gt; (TWTC) and ♡❤Taipei Audio Video Fair♡❤ at the TWTC and &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Grand%20Hotel"&gt;The Grand Hotel&lt;/a&gt;, opened in &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei"&gt;Taipei&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;. Some politicians and government officials chose these events as an opportunity to promote their parties and campaign-coalitions ahead of the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20of%20China%20presidential%20election%2C%202008"&gt;2008 Taiwan Presidential Elections&lt;/a&gt;.

From the &lt;a href="w%3Aincumbent"&gt;incumbent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APan-Green%20Coalition"&gt;Pan-Green Coalition&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;President of the Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AChen%20Shui-bian"&gt;Chen Shui-bian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APremier%20of%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;Premier of Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AChang%20Chun-hsiung"&gt;Chang Chun-hsiung&lt;/a&gt;, and spokesman for the &lt;a href="w%3AExecutive%20Yuan"&gt;Executive Yuan&lt;/a&gt; Jung-tai Cho visited the two shows successively and were innundated by Taiwanese media. President Chen avoided answering questions on the hot topic of commodities prices, addressing only those about the medical industry development, overseen by Sheng-mao Hou, Minister of Health.

From the &lt;a href="w%3APan-Blue%20Coalition"&gt;Pan-Blue Coalition&lt;/a&gt;, 2008 vice-presidential candidate, and former Premier, &lt;a href="w%3AVincent%20Siew"&gt;Vincent Siew&lt;/a&gt; participated the opening of the ♡❤Taipei Audio Video Fair♡❤ at &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Grand%20Hotel"&gt;The Grand Hotel&lt;/a&gt;. He criticized on the economy policy and remarked: "The ruling party [DPP] doesn't have a good track record, and some industries weren't be supported in timely manner so that they lost some opportunities. I sincerely hope the government can appropriately assist the audio and video industries in marketing good brands and products to the world."

Also, current &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Progressive%20Party"&gt;Democratic Progressive Party&lt;/a&gt; legislator Wang Shih-chien was invited to give a violin performance and sing a Taiwanese song. The events at the Taipei World Trade Center proved to be quite a platform for the candidates running in the 2008 Taiwan Presidential Elections.

The 28th &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei"&gt;Taipei&lt;/a&gt; Audio Video Fair (TAVF), organized by the Taipei Electrical Commercial Association (TECA), featured not only some innovative domestic market exhibition ideas, but also offered a pavilion entitled the "Global Audio and Video History Corridor", to showcase the audio and video industry's world-wide history. ♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reporter attended the fair, which, this year, highlighted TECA's 60th anniversary.

At the &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Grand%20Hotel"&gt;Taipei Grand Hotel&lt;/a&gt; (Yuanshan Hall), some participants (exhibitors) rented soundproof guest rooms, which offered the best quality and performance for audio experiences. With high-definition television becoming a popular topic, some pre-market or marketed wide-screen HDTVs featuring 1080p were exhibited at the &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20World%20Trade%20Center"&gt;Taipei World Trade Center&lt;/a&gt; (TWTC Hall).

The TAVF show runs from November 8 to 12, closing at 8:00 p.m. (Taipei Time) each night except November 12, which has a closing time of 6 p.m. To assist visitors from The Grand Hotel, TWTC and TECA hired the Metropolitan Transport Corporation for an inter-hall shuttle service. The peak number of visitors are expected to be on the weekend after permitting minors under 120 cm to enter the showground.

If the same fixture can be played in different countries same day, today in 2007 BWC and Konami Cup 2007 was the best example of this. Two professional teams battled in &lt;a href="w%3ATokyo"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;, but two national teams battled in &lt;a href="w%3ATaichung"&gt;Taichung&lt;/a&gt;.

At the Konami Cup, SK Wyverns easily won by &lt;a href="w%3AMercy_rule%23Baseball_and_softball"&gt;ending early&lt;/a&gt; the games against China Stars with 13-0 by SK's aggressive hitting firstly, but in the "Uni-President Lions vs Chunichi Dragons", they battled with a pitching game.

The key factors of &lt;a href="w%3Aerror%20%28baseball%29"&gt;errors&lt;/a&gt; decided the winner in this game. At the top of 5th inning, it started from Motonobu Tanishige's "hit by pitch", with &lt;a href="w%3Aerror%20%28baseball%29"&gt;errors&lt;/a&gt; by Uni Lions' third-base man Tilson Brito, reversing the match with 2 RBIs with base full chance by Chunichi Dragons, and Hirokazu Ibata's 1 RBI hit, Dragons finally defeated Lions at home (Japan) with 4-2.

In the same time, Chinese Taipei and Japan National Team battled in Taichung. Pre-sale tickets of this match were unavailable in site. To maintain the honor of the host (Taiwan, as of Chinese Taipei), Chien-fu Yang battled Junichi Tazawa in the starting pitch. With a aggressive battings led by Tai-shan Chang, 5 hits scored 3 RBIs in the bottom of 6th inning, and the relief pitcher Fu-de Ni successfully closed battings from Japan, Chinese Taipei won Japan with 6-1.

By results at different places, this alternative battle drew with upholding their own home each other.

The &lt;a href="w%3AConsumer%20Product%20Safety%20Commission"&gt;U.S Consumer Product Safety Commission&lt;/a&gt; has more products over the last few days, though not all because of excessive lead.

While &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; toy companies have been rocked in the last few months by numerous &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Chinese%20export%20recalls"&gt;unsafe Chinese-made products&lt;/a&gt;, mostly due to excessive amounts of lead in paint, a few of the latest recalls were actually due to design flaws.

Also recently recalled are sunglasses and toy cars from the &lt;a href="w%3ADollar%20General"&gt;Dollar General&lt;/a&gt; chain of &lt;a href="w%3Avariety%20store"&gt;price-point retailers&lt;/a&gt;.

Before the "&lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; Walking Day", Sports Affairs Council of Executive Yuan (SAC Taiwan) held "2007 Master forum on Walking" at Da-Hsin Campus of Chinese Culture University today. This forum invited walking experts from &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Belgium"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt; to share experiences on promotion of walking. Chi Cheng, spokeswoman of Taiwan Walking Day, thanked SAC Taiwan for the promotion of public sports especially walking, and she appealed forum participants integrating sports into people's life to keep in healthy.

At the keynotes, Luc Henau, former president of International Marching League Walking Association (IMLWA), focused on the relationship between soul, spirit, society, and body. He pointed out the importance on walking, participation structure between different ages, and effective on social and neighborhood interactions by glancing the history of the IMLWA.

In the part of "Mr. Pedometer" W. Ron Sutton, he explained some successful cases of pedometer counting in their life and described some advances of walking. Finally, Japanese "10,000 steps a day" expert Yoshiro Hatano analyzed some statistics to emphasize the importance between health and sports. "Some cardiovascular diseases were originated with bad habits, nutrition problems, and doing less sports." Hatano said.

After the speech, Min-yu Wu (General Manager of Taiwan Post Co., Ltd.) and Jongher Yang (Commissioner of SAC Taiwan) announced the release of "2007 Walking Stamp", and awarded "2007 Recreation Sports Stamp" to the panelists (Henau, Sutton, and Hatano) for the end of this forum.

Ron Cahill, a &lt;a href="w%3ACanberra"&gt;Canberra&lt;/a&gt; resident and chief coroner of the &lt;a href="Australian%20Capital%20Territory"&gt;Australian Capital Territory&lt;/a&gt;, has concluded the inquest into the deaths of three &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n nationals who were amongst the 21 people killed in the crash of &lt;a href="w%3AGaruda%20Indonesia"&gt;Garuda Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGaruda%20Indonesia%20Flight%20200"&gt;Flight 200&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="Boeing"&gt;Boeing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20737"&gt;737-400&lt;/a&gt; aircraft overshot a runway at &lt;a href="w%3AYogyakarta"&gt;Yogyakarta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; on March 7.

The inquest indicated that Alison Sudradjat, Brice Steele and Mark Scott died from injuries sustained in the crash. Cahill commented that this finding would also apply to the deaths of two other Australians on the flight; the remaining fatal injuries were sustained by Indonesians. The inquest was opened at the request of families of the three victims involved in this inquest after the repatriation of their bodies.

Cahill agreed fully with a recent report issued by the Indonesian &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Transportation%20Safety%20Committee"&gt;National Transportation Safety Committee&lt;/a&gt;, which indicated that the pilot-in-command attempted to land the aircraft at extreme speed despite 15 automated cockpit warnings and a request from the co-pilot to perform a &lt;a href="w%3Ago-around"&gt;go-around&lt;/a&gt;. He went on to suggest that the pilot should be prosecuted over his mistakes.

"I recommend that &lt;a href="w%3ACivil%20Aviation%20Safety%20Authority"&gt;CASA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAir%20Services%20Australia"&gt;Air Services Australia&lt;/a&gt; and all Australian airlines review the report to consider whether any of the safety deficiencies identified have relevance to Australian aviation operations and therefore need to be addressed," he said.

He went on to describe concerns with how these deficiencies are being addressed in Indonesia: "It is of some concern that the Indonesian regulator, the &lt;a href="w%3ADirectorate%20General%20of%20Civil%20Aviation"&gt;Directorate General of Civil Aviation&lt;/a&gt;, did not provide the National Transportation Safety Committee with details of safety action to address the recommendations which were in the draft report."

Alison Sudrajat's daughter had this to say in light of the findings: "It was very informative and it was nice to know what exactly happened, because he went into quite some detail about everything." 

"It was quite comforting, but it's not going to bring anyone back."

Harry McNevin, explained in a recent interview that he quit the Board of Regents at &lt;a href="w%3AOral%20Roberts%20University"&gt;Oral Roberts University&lt;/a&gt; in disgust in 1987 after 16 years of service when he learned that &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Roberts%20%28evangelist%29"&gt;Richard Roberts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AOral%20Roberts"&gt;Oral Roberts&lt;/a&gt; and other Roberts family dipped into the school's endowment fund for personal expenses. 

McNevin noted that he resigned after the board practically "rubber-stamped" the "use of millions in endowment money to buy a Beverly Hills property so that Oral Roberts could have a West Coast office and house." In addition he said a country club membership was purchased for the home. The home was reported purchased for &lt;a href="w%3AUS%24"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;3 million and another $3.5 million was spent remodeling it.

The ♡❤Associated Press♡❤ also cited Patti Roberts, Richard's first wife, who wrote in her 1983 memoir, "Ashes to Gold," about expensive gifts including a blue Mercedes as a Christmas gift for Richard, a Jaguar for her, Italian suits and Palm Beach vacations. Suzanne Culpepper, the Roberts' former nanny, said Lindsay (Richard' second wife) and Richard spent money wildly. This included 275 pairs of shoes for Lindsay, 120 pairs of shoes (including 18 pairs of golf shoes) for Richard, 165 suits for Richard and other large amounts of clothing in their walk-in closest.

Previously the Roberts were accused of illegal political and financial wrongdoing, which forced the president to step down from his position.

A &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; Senate committee is currently investigating six major ministries over their finances. Three of these ministries are headed by members of ORU's Board of Regents.

Recently &lt;a href="w%3ATulsa%20World"&gt;Tulsa World&lt;/a&gt; wrote that Oral Roberts University raised $8.8 million starting in 2001 for a new student center, but construction has begun and officials said "the school has used some of the money for scholarships and operations." Tulsa World requested documents about the ORU student center, but the "university released details but not records about money raised for the center."

Millions of people in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; and many other Commonwealth countries observed two minutes silence in memory of the millions who died fighting for their countries during the &lt;a href="w%3AFirst%20World%20War"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt; which ended exactly 89 years ago today.

The U.K. ceremony was held in &lt;a href="w%3AWhitehall"&gt;Whitehall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; where wreaths were laid by the &lt;a href="w%3AQueen"&gt;Queen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADuke%20of%20Edinburgh"&gt;Duke of Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt; and many others including &lt;a href="w%3APrince%20William"&gt;Prince William&lt;/a&gt; for the first time. Former &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Tony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; and representatives from the &lt;a href="w%3AArmy"&gt;Army&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANavy"&gt;Navy&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Air%20Force"&gt;Royal Air Force&lt;/a&gt; amongst others participated in the service which was watched by many thousands across the world.

Britain's oldest known veteran, &lt;a href="w%3AHenry%20Allingham"&gt;Henry Allingham&lt;/a&gt; aged 111 years old, laid a wreath in &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; as part of the international ceremonies which are also taking place in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Sri%20Lanka"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;. The two minutes silence at the U.K. ceremony was marked by the firing of a field gun on Horse Guards Parade to begin and end the silence, followed by Royal Marines buglers, playing the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALast%20Post"&gt;Last Post&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

<h3>Glasgow to host 2014 Commonwealth Games</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3AGlasgow"&gt;Glasgow&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Scotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; was today announced to be the host of the &lt;a href="w%3A2014%20Commonwealth%20Games"&gt;2014 Commonwealth Games&lt;/a&gt;. The result which was announced in &lt;a href="Sri%20Lanka"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt; was witnessed by thousands of people who had gathered in Glasgow to watch the announcement and resulted in "jubilation" in the streets. 

Glasgow won the right to host the event after winning the vote 47 to 24 against &lt;a href="Nigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;. The games will be held in July and August of 2014 and will last for 11 days with over 6000 athletes and officials expected to attend the event.

<h3>iPhone goes on sale in Europe</h3>
 &lt;span style="display:none"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
The &lt;a href="Apple"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AiPhone"&gt;iPhone&lt;/a&gt; has gone on sale today in &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; with many people queuing over night to buy the device. The cost of the device in the UK is £269 with a 18 month £35 contract which has caused major controversy. Many people have been unhappy with the decision by Apple to lock the phone to use one network exclusively and have been accused of being "anti-competitive". Many people have also un-locked the phone using un-official hack to circumnavigate the restrictions imposed on the phone, however Apple have said that this will void the warranty.

The launch of the product five months after its &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; release was marred by a &lt;a href="w%3ACarphone%20Warehouse"&gt;Carphone Warehouse&lt;/a&gt; computer glitch which meant that credit and debt card transactions could not be completed.

<h3>UK tidal surge</h3>

The &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; tidal surge hit the East coast of &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; today, but did not cause as much damage as expected. Thousands of people returned to their houses after being evacuated last night to scenes of localised flooding. Meteriologists had feared that the wave could break the storm defences on the coast and lead to severe widespread flooding however 20 cm lower wave heights meant that this did not occur. 

The &lt;a href="w%3AThames%20Barrier"&gt;Thames Barrier&lt;/a&gt; has re-opened after being closed last night in preparation for the event, however officials have been criticised by some local people for not doing enough to inform the residents and not giving them enough time to defend their property.

On Friday, &lt;a href="Michael%20Mukasey"&gt;Michael Mukasey&lt;/a&gt; was confirmed by the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; as the next &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Attorney%20General"&gt;Attorney General&lt;/a&gt;, succeeding &lt;a href="Alberto%20Gonzales"&gt;Alberto Gonzales&lt;/a&gt;. Mukasey took the oath of office with his family attending in a private ceremony that was administered by Assistant Attorney General Lee Lofthus.

The nomination of Mukasey, by President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;, hit a rough spot over the issue of interrogations, in particular about &lt;a href="w%3Awaterboarding"&gt;waterboarding&lt;/a&gt;. "This man has been a judge for 18 years,” said Senator &lt;a href="w%3ADianne%20Feinstein"&gt;Dianne Feinstein&lt;/a&gt;, who along with Senator &lt;a href="w%3AChuck%20Schumer"&gt;Chuck Schumer&lt;/a&gt; provided the essential votes to pass Mukasey through the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20the%20Judiciary"&gt;Senate Judiciary Committee&lt;/a&gt;. "Maybe he likes to consider the facts before he makes a decision."

"I am not going to aid and abet the confirmation contortions of this administration," said Senator &lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Leahy%20%28politician%29"&gt;Patrick Leahy&lt;/a&gt;, who voted against Mukasey, in both the Committee and the Senate votes.

In a statement released by the &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;, President Bush said: "I thank the Senate for its bipartisan vote confirming Judge Michael Mukasey as the Nation's 81st Attorney General. Judge Mukasey is a man of strong character and integrity, with exceptional legal judgment."

Besides becoming a &lt;a href="Candidates%20make%20campaign%20stop%20at%20trade%20fairs%20ahead%20of%202008%20Taiwan%20Presidential%20Election"&gt;political stomping ground&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href="w%3APan-Green%20Coalition"&gt;Pan-Green&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APan-Blue%20Coalition"&gt;Pan-Blue&lt;/a&gt; coalitions, there are other changes from past years of Taipei Audio Video Fair (TAVF). With those changes in mind, ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ reporter interviewed You-peng Wang, chairman of the Taipei Electrical Commercial Association (TECA), the main organizer of TAVF, about the 60th year anniversary of TECA and the changes to the show.
<h2>Interview</h2>
<h3>Part 1: Yuanshan Hall in The Grand Hotel</h3>
♡❤♡Rico Shen♡❤♡: This show features exhibition at the twin halls, &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Grand%20Hotel"&gt;The Grand Hotel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20World%20Trade%20Center"&gt;Taipei World Trade Center&lt;/a&gt;, why did TECA decide to exhibit at these two halls?

♡❤♡Wang♡❤♡: In past years of TAVF, many participants promoted subwoofers, loudspeakers, and AV-media devices for sale, but some world-class Taiwanese companies may need good environment for the Hi-End experiences. As of this year, you can see some exhibitors imported a truck container house or rented a guest room for soundproof and high quality experiences and to serve senior AV-media consumers.
♡❤♡Rico Shen♡❤♡: Particularly the Hi-End quality is the best arrangement for TECA. Also, I sincerely congratulate TECA for the 60th year anniversary. By the way, what are the changes in Taiwan's AV-media industry?

♡❤♡Wang♡❤♡: In the past, some Taiwanese companies served as agencies and &lt;a href="w%3ASemiconductor%20fabrication%20plant"&gt;foundries&lt;/a&gt; for international manufacturers. They used &lt;a href="w%3AOriginal%20design%20manufacturer"&gt;original design manufacturers&lt;/a&gt; (ODM), manufacturing for other brands. Now, local brands and products (&lt;a href="w%3AOriginal%20equipment%20manufacturer"&gt;OEM&lt;/a&gt;) with good quality are increasingly marketed to the world, receiving praise by world-class professional media outside of Taiwan. We at TECA are proud of this success.

♡❤♡Rico Shen♡❤♡: In recent press conferences, some gaming and video companies cooperated with AV-media companies for high-definition and quality promotion. It caused some companies to become notable. What does TECA think about this trend and fashion? Does TECA support this way of promotion or cooperating?

♡❤♡Wang♡❤♡: We are extremely encouraged by our member companies who cooperate with different companies from the other industries like gaming, video, and information technology. I believe they've seen good factors at high-definition AV-media infrastructure in Taiwan.

<h3>Part 2: TWTC Hall (Taipei World Trade Center)</h3>
Before returning to TWTC, Wang mentioned on the effectiveness of &lt;a href="w%3Asoundproofing"&gt;soundproofing&lt;/a&gt;, after a visit to a container house, some exhibitors thought soundproofing to be a key factor when experiencing loss-less Hi-End sound and said: "We must provide the best experience and conditions to show the greatest performances of loudspeakers". The interview below mentions the "quality conception".

♡❤♡Rico Shen♡❤♡: At the 60th year anniversary of the TECA this year, besides of the twin halls exhibition, what's the reason for the feature of the "Global Audio &amp; Video History Corridor" Pavilion at TWTC Hall?

♡❤♡Wang♡❤♡: If you're involved with the AV-media industry for the first time, you may not understand the evolution of its industry especially "old antiques". We made several old consumer AV-media players available to trace back on the history of the AV-media industry world-wide. And newbies (new consumers who just got involved with this industry) can learn the evolution of this industry by viewing the display of notable AV-media products from the past to the present.

♡❤♡Rico Shen♡❤♡: I just forgot to say something at Yuanshan, because TAITRA and Taipei Computer Association (TCA) ever held "Exhibitors' Coordination of 2008 Computex Taipei" last month, and I interviewed &lt;a href="Taipei%20Computer%20Association%20-%20a%20key%20player%20at%20IT%20industry%20and%20exhibition%20in%20Taiwan"&gt;Enoch Du, the Secretary General of TCA&lt;/a&gt;. Both of those mentioned the recent issue of traffic problems. With the twin halls' exhibition, how the TECA solve the traffic issue during the show?

♡❤♡Wang♡❤♡: We [TECA] submitted the traffic solutions to the Department of Transportation of Taipei City Government and applied the shuttle bus service to Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) for the visitors' convenience to go TWTC or Yuanshan and back. During the weekend hours, MTC will supply more shuttle buses to decrease the waiting period. For the MRT stations, we decided to improve the MRT shuttle bus service at MRT Yuanshan Station rather than Taipei City Hall Station because Capital Bus Co., Ltd has served the &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20101"&gt;Taipei 101&lt;/a&gt; shuttle bus for a long period.

<h2>Summary</h2>

Taipei Audio Video Fair in this year is different than the past years. It is not just a "local domestic show" but conjoined education with enjoyment so that the 2007 TAVF takes advantage of the show's contents. The quality of a show is more valuable than the results to keep its good image with the media and the public.

&lt;a href="w%3APASOK"&gt;PASOK&lt;/a&gt; (♡❤Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement♡❤) party members and voters will decide tomorrow for party's president, in a wide election throughout &lt;a href="Greece"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;. Almost one million party members, voters and friends of PASOK will gather in selected ballot boxes in all the main cities of the country to vote for party's leader, after the defeat of September 16, 2007, in the national elections.

The three candidates for PASOK's presidency are the current president - and president of the &lt;a href="w%3ASocialist%20International"&gt;Socialist International&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Papandreou"&gt;George Papandreou&lt;/a&gt;, the MP and former &lt;a href="w%3AMinister"&gt;Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AEvangelos%20Venizelos"&gt;Dr.Evangelos Venizelos&lt;/a&gt; and the former Secretary of the party &lt;a href="w%3AKostas%20Skandalidis"&gt;Kostas Skandalides&lt;/a&gt;. Until now, opinion polls show that Papandreou leads the presidential race with around 2%-6% difference from Venizelos, but political analysts remain unsure in their predictions about the result of the elections. 

Yesterday, the candidates concluded their pre-election campaigns with public speeches in &lt;a href="w%3AAthens"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AThessaloniki"&gt;Thessaloniki&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AKos"&gt;Kos&lt;/a&gt; respectively. Mr.Papandreou delivered a speech in Peristeri, west Athens while Mr.Venizelos organized a political fiesta with over 5,000 supporters of him, in his hometown Thessaloniki. Skandalides ended his campaign in his birthplace, the island of Kos. 

PASOK, founded by the popular politician &lt;a href="w%3AAndreas%20Papandreou"&gt;Andreas Papandreou&lt;/a&gt; in 1974, was in government from 1981 to 1989 and from 1993 to 2004, dominating most of the modern Greek politics. Last September, the party was defeated in the 2007 parliamentary elections from the conservative &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Democracy"&gt;New Democracy&lt;/a&gt;. Since then criticism and challenge on George Papandreou's leadership, by prominent members of PASOK such as Mr.Venizelos, has been increased

<h1>Ancient volcano in Yellowstone National Park is rising</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Ancient%20volcano%20in%20Yellowstone%20National%20Park%20is%20rising&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Recent satellite pictures of &lt;a href="w%3AYellowstone%20National%20Park"&gt;Yellowstone National Park&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Wyoming"&gt;Wyoming&lt;/a&gt; from 2004 through 2006 are showing that an ancient volcano is starting to rise once again.

Molten rock is currently pushing up the remains of the volcano's &lt;a href="w%3Acaldera"&gt;caldera&lt;/a&gt;, which sits over the top of Yellowstone lake, but scientists are stressing that there is no immediate threat of an eruption or explosion. The molten rock field is estimated to be the size of the city of &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%2C%20California"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;.

"There is no evidence of an imminent volcanic eruption or hydrothermal explosion. That's the bottom line. A lot of calderas worldwide go up and down over decades without erupting," said Robert Smith a &lt;a href="w%3Aseismology"&gt;seismologist&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Utah"&gt;University of Utah&lt;/a&gt; in a statement to the press.

The images show that between 2004 and 2006, the volcano's caldera rose 2.8 inches per year for a total rise of seven inches. This is the quickest rise ever observed from a caldera in Yellowstone since observations began in 1923.

Scientists are not sure how long the event has been happening and they are also not sure if the rise will cause an eruption in the distant future.

"Our best evidence is that the crustal magma chamber is filling with molten rock. But we have no idea how long this process goes on before there either is an eruption or the inflow of molten rock stops and the caldera deflates again," added Smith.

Volcanic activity in Yellowstone heats up underground water which create &lt;a href="w%3Ageysers"&gt;geysers&lt;/a&gt; of superheated water, and is responsible for the creation and continuous eruption of &lt;a href="w%3AOld%20Faithful"&gt;Old Faithful&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>News briefs:November 11, 2007</h1>
Goodmorning, it's Sunday, November 11 2007, I'm bringing you this weeks headlines from Audio Wikinews.

=Headlines=
<h2>&lt;a href="Mukasey%20confirmed%20and%20sworn%20in%20as%20Attorney%20General%20for%20US"&gt;Mukasey confirmed and sworn in as Attorney General for US&lt;/a&gt;</h2>
On Friday, Michael Mukasey was confirmed by the United States Senate as the next Attorney General, succeeding Alberto Gonzales. Mukasey triggered a political row during pre-confirmation questioning, when he refused to state that waterboarding amounted to illegal torture. In the end, he was able to secure the key votes of two Democrats after assuring them that, if Congress passed legislation that made waterboarding illegal, he would in fact work to enforce such a law.

<h2>&lt;a href="Pakistan%20lifts%20house%20arrest%20of%20former%20PM%20Benazir%20Bhutto"&gt;Pakistan lifts house arrest of former PM Benazir Bhutto&lt;/a&gt;</h2>
The government of Pakistan late on Friday has withdrawn the earlier detention notice and house arrest of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Police had served her with a temporary detention notice and ordered her to serve 30 days of house arrest. Bhutto has publicly announced that she will head a protest against the country's president, Pervez Musharraf, in an attempt to get him to resign as head of the country's military. A protest march from Lahore to Islamabad is scheduled for early next week.

<h2>&lt;a href="Finland%20considers%20tougher%20gun%20laws"&gt;Finland considers tougher gun laws&lt;/a&gt;</h2>
Finland is considering toughening gun legislation in light of this week's Jokela school shooting. Nine people, including the gunman, were killed when 18-year-old Pekka-Eric Auvinen went on a shooting spree at his local school. The perpetrator murdered his headmistress, school nurse and six students, as well as wounding one other victim, before turning his gun on himself.
The U.S Consumer Product Safety Commission has recalled more products over the last few days, due to excessive levels of lead and design flaws. Last Wednesday, a children's toy manufactured in Hong Kong was pulled off toy store shelves in the United Kingdom because it contained traces of a toxic compound related to gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, notorious for being misused as a date rape drug. At least 20 million toys are affected.
Glasgow in Scotland was announced on Friday to be the host of the 2014 Commonwealth Games. Thousands of people gathered to watch the announcement rejoiced in the streets of Glasgow. The Scottish city won the right to host the event after winning the vote 47 to 24 against Nigeria.
Also on Friday, the Apple iPhone has gone on sale in Europe. The cost of the device in the U.K. is £269. Many people have been unhappy with the decision by Apple to lock the phone to use one network exclusively. Critics labeled the move as being "anti-competitive".

<h2>&lt;a href="Canadian%20defence%20minister%20escapes%20rocket%20attack%20in%20Afghanistan"&gt;Canadian defence minister escapes rocket attack in Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;</h2>
Earlier Canadian Minister of Defence Peter MacKay just narrowly escaped a rocket attack by the Taliban in Afghanistan.

<h2>&lt;a href="Belgium%20still%20without%20government%2C%20new%20record%20set"&gt;Belgium still without government, new record set&lt;/a&gt;</h2>
After federal elections on June 10, 2007, coalition talks in Belgium have still failed to result in compromises on the main electoral issues. On Tuesday, a previous record from 1988 was broken after 149 days without a new government.

&lt;a href="w%3AFootball%20%28soccer%29%20in%20Australia"&gt;Australian football&lt;/a&gt;'s controlling body, &lt;a href="w%3AFootball%20Federation%20Australia"&gt;Football Federation Australia&lt;/a&gt;, will launch an investigation into reported crowd violence at an &lt;a href="w%3AA-League"&gt;A-League&lt;/a&gt; match between &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne%20Victory%20FC"&gt;Melbourne Victory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASydney%20FC"&gt;Sydney FC&lt;/a&gt; on November 10.

The match at &lt;a href="w%3ATelstra%20Dome"&gt;Telstra Dome&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, which attracted more than 30,000 spectators, ended in a 0-0 draw. According to reports from the &lt;a href="w%3AFairfax"&gt;Fairfax Media&lt;/a&gt; publications, fans threw seats at their rivals at the conclusion of the match.

It has also been reported that a number of Melbourne supporters "invaded the pitch and set fire to items on the field", also after the match. 

Police were reportedly forced to react with &lt;a href="w%3ACapsicum%20spray"&gt;capsicum spray&lt;/a&gt; to de-esculate the situation. Although Sydney fans had been relocated into an area separate from the home supporters, reports suggest they were provoked and retaliated by using the seating as projectiles.

Rob Abernethy, who was appointed head of A-League operations by the FFA, said that the governing body had requested reports from the Telstra Dome, the Melbourne Victory Football Club, as well as the police and security companies employed at the event.

Abernethy also condemned the alleged behaviour, questioning whether the people involved should be considered 'supporters'. "It is disappointing that a minority of so-called supporters may have behaved in an inappropriate manner", he said.

It just wasn't their day for the two baseball teams on either side of the Straight, as China Stars and Uni-President Lions were both eliminated in a route at the Konami Cup 2007. The final of Konami Cup will take place between SK Wyverns and Chunichi Dragons.

<h2>Chunichi Dragons (Japan) vs China Stars (China)</h2>

For first 5 innings, the game was tied at 1-1. It was amazing that starting pitcher Jiangang Lu (China Stars) managed to shut down the Dragons' offense by only giving up one run. But Masahiro Araki broke the deadlock in the bottom of 6th by hitting a solo HR, thus making Lu losing pitcher of the game. The Dragons went on to defeat the China Stars with a final score of 9-1.

<h2>Uni-President Lions (Taiwan) vs SK Wyverns (South Korea)</h2>
This game would determine whether the Uni Lions or the SK Wyverns would qualify for the final after the Dragons defeated the China Stars. But SK eliminated all the suspense by scoring 13 runs in the first 4 innings. Even though the Lions' fielder Sung-sian Yang belted a solo HR, the SK Wyverns &lt;a href="w%3AMercy_rule%23Baseball_and_softball"&gt;mercy-ruled&lt;/a&gt; their opponent with a score of 13A-1 and promptly advanced to a showdown with the Chunichi Dragons.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Ulster%20Freedom%20Fighters%20to%20stand%20down%20at%20midnight%3B%20Northern%20Ireland&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The Loyalist &lt;a href="w%3AUlster%20Defence%20Association"&gt;Ulster Defence Association&lt;/a&gt; (UDA) has announced that its paramilitary wing, the &lt;a href="w%3AUlster%20Freedom%20Fighters"&gt;Ulster Freedom Fighters&lt;/a&gt; (UFF), is to stand down all its "active service units" at midnight tonight, and their weapons are to be "put beyond use" but not decommissioned, and all military intelligence destroyed. 

The announcement was made in a statement read out at a 1000-strong &lt;a href="w%3ARemembrance%20Day"&gt;Remembrance Day parade&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ABelfast"&gt;Belfast's&lt;/a&gt; Sandy Row district by Colin Halliday, a spokesman for the Ulster Political Research Group, which is associated with the UDA. He said that "The Ulster Defence Association believes that the war is over, and we are now in a new democratic dispensation that will lead to permanent political stability - but we believe the political parties and the political institutions are themselves still in a period of transition."

"In that context, the organisation intends to continue through a process of transformation that will ultimately achieve a Northern Ireland based on equality, justice and inclusivity where no sections of our people are left behind regardless of religion, politics or identity." He added that if loyalist rights or the union with &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Northern%20Ireland"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt; were threatened then the organisation would defend itself only by non-violent means. The statement also added that those who had joined the UDA's ranks for crime and self gain, including drug dealers, would be rooted out and that anyone who had information about crime should pass it on to the &lt;a href="w%3APolice%20Service%20of%20Northern%20Ireland"&gt;Police&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20of%20Ireland"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATaoiseach"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABertie%20Ahern"&gt;Bertie Ahern&lt;/a&gt; welcomed the statement, describing it as "significant" and "a further step towards ending all paramilitarism in Northern Ireland".

During &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Troubles"&gt;the Troubles&lt;/a&gt;, which ran from 1968 to 1998, the UDA/UFF is thought to have been responsible for over 400 deaths. The UDA's opponents, the &lt;a href="w%3AProvisional%20IRA"&gt;Provisional IRA&lt;/a&gt; decommissioned its weapons in August-September 2005.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Vanity%20Fair%20contributing%20editor%20Craig%20Unger%20on%20the%20Bush%20family%20feud%2C%20neoconservatives%20and%20the%20Christian%20right&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
In &lt;a href="Dalai%20Lama%27s%20representative%20talks%20about%20China%2C%20Tibet%2C%20Shugden%20and%20the%20next%20Dalai%20Lama"&gt;a recent interview&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href="w%3A14th%20Dalai%20Lama"&gt;Dalai Lama&lt;/a&gt;’s Representative to the Americas, Tashi Wangdi, remarked to him that Americans have trouble relating to centuries-long conflicts that exist between peoples around the world, including those in Asia. Many Asian countries dislike each other tremendously, and the conflict over Tibet is just one enduring multi-national battle.

According to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AVanity%20Fair"&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ contributing editor &lt;a href="w%3ACraig%20Unger"&gt;Craig Unger&lt;/a&gt;, it is not that Americans do not have these deep-seeded conflicts; it is that they do not remember them and thus have no context in which to see them as they resurface in our political culture. 

On the same day he spoke to the Dalai Lama’s representative, Shankbone sat down with Unger, author of &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Times%20Best%20Seller%20list"&gt;♡❤The New York Times♡❤ best-seller&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20of%20Bush%2C%20House%20of%20Saud"&gt;House of Bush, House of Saud&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. In his new book, ♡❤The Fall of the House of Bush♡❤, Unger attempts to fill in some of the blanks of an epochal narrative in American politics. Using a mix of painstaking research, interviews with cultural and political leaders and delving into previously classified records to come up with some overview of how America has arrived at this particular political moment. 

To make sense of such complicated history, Unger draws upon three themes: He illustrates the conflict within the modern Republican Party via the oedipal conflict between &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; and his father, &lt;a href="w%3A%20George%20H.W.%20Bush"&gt;George H.W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;. Things are not well within the House of Bush. Bush Jr. has not only shut out his father and his allies from his &lt;a href="w%3AAdministration%20of%20George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;administration&lt;/a&gt;—something &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Woodward"&gt;Bob Woodward&lt;/a&gt; discovered in his interviews with the President—but he also appointed many of his father’s bitterest enemies to key cabinet positions.
Unger’s second theme draws upon this Bush family feud: many of Bush Sr.’s foes happen to be leaders of the &lt;a href="w%3ANeoconservative"&gt;neoconservative movement&lt;/a&gt;, who had been working against the President’s father since the 1970’s. Back then the neoconservatives did not have a base of political support within the Republican Party, which brings Unger to his third theme: the marriage between the neoconservatives and the &lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20right"&gt;Christian right&lt;/a&gt; to create a formidable ideological block.
Unger is a Fellow at the Center for Law and Security at &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20University%20School%20of%20Law"&gt;NYU’s School of Law&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to his work at ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AVanity%20Fair%20%28magazine%29"&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, he is a former editor-in-chief of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABoston%20Magazine"&gt;Boston Magazine&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, and former Deputy Editor of the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Observer"&gt;New York Observer&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. A journalist of the old school who believes in verifying his sources’ veracity, Unger illuminates the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Republican%20Party"&gt;Republican Party&lt;/a&gt;’s ideological struggle between the old and the new and traces its history for those who do know it.

Unger disputes the recent assertion by ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3A%20The%20New%20York%20Times"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that these forces are dead; they are thriving. Below is ’s interview with Craig Unger about his book, ♡❤The Fall of the House of Bush♡❤. 
<h2>On the likelihood of an attack on Iran before the 2008 election</h2>
♡❤♡David Shankbone: &lt;a href="w%3ATim%20Wirth"&gt;Tim Wirth&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href="w%3A%20David%20Mixner"&gt;David Mixner&lt;/a&gt; this &lt;a href="http%3A//www.lrb.co.uk/v29/n20/holt01_.html"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; by Jim Holt in the London Review of Books, and Mixner sent me a link to it. It posits that the Bush administration has all along planned on having a permanent military presence in Iraq. Have you seen it?

♡❤♡DS: You’ve written that Iran is definitely on the agenda for a military strike by the Americans.
♡❤♡DS: If the neconservatives succeed, two years into the future where will we be?
♡❤♡DS: Are there any Republican front-runners that would not undertake an assault on Iran?
♡❤♡DS: So it could have been anybody but they ingratiated themselves with Bush?
♡❤♡DS: And he wasn’t particularly well-informed, giving them an “in” to educate him?
♡❤♡DS: Within the United States, what are the neoconservatives and Christian right concerned will happen that could scuttle their agenda?
♡❤♡DS: Would that still work after all this time?

<h2>This history behind the Bush family feud</h2>
♡❤♡DS: Is there a movement within the Republican Party that is working against the fundamentalism in the party?
♡❤♡DS: &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Woodward"&gt;Bob Woodward&lt;/a&gt; was astonished when Bush Jr. told him he had not spoken to Bush Sr. about the Iraq War at all. Do you come across what is behind that? 

♡❤♡DS: That was to educate Bush? &lt;a href="w%3A%20The%20Daily%20Show"&gt;The Daily Show&lt;/a&gt; did this piece where they did a debate splicing Texas Governor Bush’s views of what he said when he was governor versus what he has said as President, and they are polar opposites. When he was governor he was saying we can’t go out nation-building.
♡❤♡DS: What was the problem with the intelligence apparatus at that time that the neocons needed to take control of it?
♡❤♡DS: How did they bring Team B into the present?

<h2>Bush appoints his father's enemies to his Cabinet</h2>
♡❤♡DS: So Rumsfeld and Cheney are not seen as old Bush Sr. people.
♡❤♡DS: Weren’t they considered part of the &lt;a href="w%3ARealpolitik"&gt;realpolitik school&lt;/a&gt;?
♡❤♡DS: What effect did it have on Bush Sr. that some of his bitterest foes were assuming positions in his son’s administration?
♡❤♡DS: I remember that mentioned.
♡❤♡DS: Why was there a dispute between Rumsfeld and Bush Sr.?
<h2>Paul Wolfowitz and the Office of Special Plans</h2>

♡❤♡DS: Coming back to current times, what continues to transpire in the formation of Bush Jr.’s 2000 cabinet?
♡❤♡DS: I believe Riza was called Wolfowitz’s “neoconcubine” by his critics.
♡❤♡DS: What does Mrs. Wolfowitz do about his &lt;a href="w%3AExtramarital%20affair"&gt;extramarital affairs&lt;/a&gt;?
♡❤♡DS: So they decide to redo the entire intelligence apparatus for Wolfowitz?
♡❤♡DS: What was the CIA’s reaction to this?
♡❤♡DS: Was Powell aware of this?
♡❤♡DS: Why?

<h2>What the neoconservatives want</h2>
♡❤♡DS: What is the end goal with all of these machinations?
♡❤♡DS: Saddam was so unpopular in the region; how did they foresee they would ruin the coalition if they rid Iraq of a very brutal dictator?
♡❤♡DS: It still is.
♡❤♡DS: &lt;a href="w%3AYasser%20Arafat"&gt;Arafat&lt;/a&gt; didn’t—
♡❤♡DS: So what is the end goal?
♡❤♡DS: To control it?
♡❤♡DS: Was that a surprise?

<h2>The Christian right and the neoconservatives</h2>
♡❤♡DS: In your book you talk about a confluence of social forces. You have the Christian right and you have the neoconservatives, who came together to assist each other in their agendas.
♡❤♡DS: To the 1970s?

♡❤♡DS: Did they openly talk to you about these things? 
♡❤♡DS: How did the neoconservatives and Christian right come together?
♡❤♡DS: It would seemingly take a lot of collusion between them. How does it work?
♡❤♡DS: Bush is convinced this is all God’s will?

<h2>Orthodox Jews and Fundamentalist Christians</h2>
♡❤♡DS: You have a chapter about the assassination of &lt;a href="w%3AYitzak%20Rabin"&gt;Yitzak Rabin&lt;/a&gt;; how did that advance the neoconservative agenda?
♡❤♡DS: Are the Israeli orthodox Jews in touch with the Christian right in the United States?
♡❤♡DS: What does the Christian right have to gain from this?
♡❤♡DS: The &lt;a href="w%3AEnd%20time"&gt;End of Days&lt;/a&gt;?
♡❤♡DS: This is so much material to be covered in just one book.
♡❤♡DS: They have a model of the Supreme Court for arguing these fights.
♡❤♡DS: Our society has always been complicated, but there are so many layers to this complex onion of a social movement that it must have been a challenge to articulate it in your book. We hold a lot of myths about our history. 
♡❤♡DS: Exactly, they recycle the same thematic stories over and over and that one has been written before.
♡❤♡DS: But Scowcroft is loathed by George W.’s administration for coming out against his foreign policy.
♡❤♡DS: What does Bush Sr. think or say about Scowcroft’s public statements?
♡❤♡DS: Why would Bush Sr. not feel he has a moral obligation to the nation to make his feelings known to his son instead of keeping quiet and not speaking up?
♡❤♡DS: The neoconservative’s policies are so high-risk and there are so many things that could make it go even more wrong. &lt;a href="w%3AGrover%20Norquist"&gt;Grover Norquist&lt;/a&gt; came out and said that nothing the supporters of the war said would happen with Iraq has happened, and that everything the critics said would happen ♡❤has♡❤ happened. If &lt;a href="Hosni%20Mubarak"&gt;Mubarak&lt;/a&gt; suddenly dies in Egypt and that country erupts into a &lt;a href="w%3AIslamic%20Brotherhood"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt;, which is a scenario that is often discussed as likely, that would implode the region even further. How do they account for all these risks they are laying in the lap of the United States?

<h2>On the press</h2>
♡❤♡DS: What sort of reaction do you get to your work?

♡❤♡DS: You painstakingly researched this—
♡❤♡DS: Who have lost almost all credibility with the public...
♡❤♡DS: We’re stuck with them.
♡❤♡DS: &lt;a href="Gay%20Talese%20on%20the%20state%20of%20journalism%2C%20Iraq%20and%20his%20life"&gt;I interviewed Gay Talese&lt;/a&gt;, who had nothing but contempt for the Washington press corps. He feels they should be broken up and dispersed around the country to report on the federal government. Report on Washington from Denver, from Austin...national reporting from the states. 
♡❤♡DS: You get to go to a party; you get to ride in &lt;a href="w%3AAir%20Force%20One"&gt;Air Force One&lt;/a&gt;—
♡❤♡DS: Just to be able to say, “I interviewed Donald Rumsfeld.”
♡❤♡DS: Talese also said that the press is as much responsible for getting us into this war as are the people running it.

<h1>US honors military service on Veterans Day</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=US%20honors%20military%20service%20on%20Veterans%20Day&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Today, the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; is marking &lt;a href="w%3AVeterans%20Day"&gt;Veterans Day&lt;/a&gt; at various events across the country.

In &lt;a href="Washington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;, many people observe the day by visiting the &lt;a href="w%3AVietnam%20War%20Memorial"&gt;Vietnam War Memorial&lt;/a&gt;, which was opened 25 years ago. Later, a wreath-laying ceremony took place to honor military veterans buried at &lt;a href="w%3AArlington%20National%20Cemetery"&gt;Arlington National Cemetery&lt;/a&gt; just outside Washington.

In the &lt;a href="Chicago"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt; area, the &lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20Veterans%20Affairs%20medical%20facilities"&gt;Edward Hines Jr. VA Hospital&lt;/a&gt; had a dedication ceremony, to commemorate a gift of 500 new wheelchairs from the &lt;a href="w%3AWheelchair%20Foundation"&gt;Wheelchair Foundation&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AKnights%20of%20Columbus"&gt;Knights of Columbus&lt;/a&gt;. It provided an opportunity for soldiers of different generations to meet.

"It's an honor to shake hands with veterans who came before me," said Christian Tecson, to the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AChicago%20Tribune"&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. Tecson, 27, who is in the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Guard%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;National Guard&lt;/a&gt;, served two &lt;a href="w%3ATour%20of%20duty"&gt;tours of duty&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Marine%20Corps"&gt;Marine Corps&lt;/a&gt;. "They paved the way for us, and we're carrying on the tradition."

In &lt;a href="w%3ADenver"&gt;Denver&lt;/a&gt;, like so many other cities, a &lt;a href="w%3Aparade"&gt;parade&lt;/a&gt; was held on this day. However, the Denver United Veterans Council told a number of &lt;a href="w%3Aanti-war"&gt;anti-war&lt;/a&gt; groups that they were not invited, regardless of whether they were also veterans groups. In the end, they were permitted to march in the parade, but got a mixed reaction from the crowd. "Leave your politics at home! This is about veterans, not politics," shouted Alex Cuellar.

Presidential candidate &lt;a href="John%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt; paid tribute to veterans at the New Hampshire Veterans Cemetery. McCain, in turn, received praise for his own service by the other speakers.

"The war and Iraq has divided America, but none of us is divided in our appreciation and our love and affection for those men and women in the military who are serving the cause of freedom," McCain said in his speech. "Some of us here were in another war where America was divided in their support and that made our challenge of welcoming and bringing home all of veterans all the harder."
In &lt;a href="Boston"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Massachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;' Govenor &lt;a href="w%3ADeval%20Patrick"&gt;Deval Patrick&lt;/a&gt; honored the five surviving &lt;a href="w%3ATuskegee%20Airmen"&gt;Tuskegee Airmen&lt;/a&gt;. Patrick called them "heroic pioneers," as he presented them with the &lt;a href="w%3ACongressional%20Gold%20Medal"&gt;Congressional Gold Medal&lt;/a&gt;, which they were awarded in March. At the same event, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Air%20Force"&gt;Air Force&lt;/a&gt; Captain Jenny D’Olympia, an Iraq War veteran, led a tribute to women veterans.

President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; said in his weekly radio address: "America owes a debt of gratitude to all those who have served in our Armed Forces. On Veterans Day, we remember those who have served in previous wars, those who are serving today, and those who did not live to become veterans."

Veterans Day is largely intended to thank veterans for their service, to acknowledge that their contributions to United States national security are appreciated, and to underscore the fact that all those who served &amp;mdash; not only those who died &amp;mdash; have sacrificed and done their duty. It was first observed on November 11, 1919, a year after the &lt;a href="w%3AArmistice%20with%20Germany%20%28Compi%C3%A8gne%29"&gt;Armistice with Germany&lt;/a&gt;, though then it was known as &lt;a href="w%3AArmistice%20Day"&gt;Armistice Day&lt;/a&gt;, which is observed in many other countries.

Boston-based singer-songwriter &lt;a href="w%3AAntje%20Duvekot"&gt;Antje Duvekot&lt;/a&gt; has made a name for herself in the &lt;a href="w%3AFolk%20music"&gt;folk music&lt;/a&gt; world with powerful ballads of heartbreak and longing for a deeper spirituality, but coming up empty-handed. Below is 's interview with the folk chanteuse. 
♡❤♡David Shankbone: Tell me about your new album.
♡❤♡DS: You mentioned you used to explore more dark themes in your work, but that lately you are exploring lighter fare. What themes are you exploring on this album? 
♡❤♡DS: What were you going through that made it so dark?
♡❤♡DS: What personal relationships do you struggle with?
♡❤♡DS: Do you believe in a &lt;a href="w%3AHigher%20power"&gt;higher power&lt;/a&gt;?
♡❤♡DS: What do you believe?
♡❤♡DS: Why do you miss having religion in your life?
♡❤♡DS: Does the idea that our lives on Earth may be all that there is unsettle you?
♡❤♡DS: You had said in an interview that your family wasn’t particularly supportive of your career path, but you are also saying they were atheists who weren’t curious about the things you are curious about. It sounds like you were a hothouse flower.
♡❤♡DS: They almost sound &lt;a href="w%3ASoviet%20Communism"&gt;Soviet Communist&lt;/a&gt;.
♡❤♡DS: What’s your relationship with them now?
♡❤♡DS: Why?
♡❤♡DS: That’s the reason you don’t speak with them?
♡❤♡DS: That must be a difficult thing to contend with, that a career would be the basis for a relationship.
♡❤♡DS: Would you say in your previous work some of your conflict of dating would have been birthed from how your relationship with your family? How do you see the arc of your work?
♡❤♡DS: Has the &lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20War"&gt;Iraq War&lt;/a&gt; affected you as an artist?
♡❤♡DS: How has it affected you personally?
♡❤♡DS: The struggle to be original in art is innate. When you are coming up with an idea for a song and then you all of a sudden stumble across it having been done somewhere else, how do you not allow that to squelch your creative impulse and drive to continue on.

♡❤♡DS: When &lt;a href="Augusten%20Burroughs%20on%20addiction%2C%20writing%2C%20his%20family%20and%20his%20new%20book"&gt;I interviewed Augusten Burroughs&lt;/a&gt; he told me that when he was in advertising he completely shut himself off from the yearly ad books that would come out of the best ads that year, because he wanted to be fresh and not poisoned by other ideas; whereas a band called &lt;a href="The%20Raveonettes%20on%20love%2C%20death%2C%20desire%20and%20war"&gt;The Raveonettes said&lt;/a&gt; they don’t try to be original they just do what they like and are upfront about their influences. Where do you fall in that spectrum?
♡❤♡DS: Who would you say are some of your biggest influences in the last year. Who have you discovered that has influenced you the most?
♡❤♡DS: You moved out of &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; because you had some difficulty with the &lt;a href="w%3AMusic%20of%20New%20York%20City"&gt;music scene here&lt;/a&gt;?
♡❤♡DS: Do you feel home up in Boston?
♡❤♡DS: Why do you think &lt;a href="w%3AMusic%20of%20Massachusetts"&gt;Boston has&lt;/a&gt; such a well-developed folk scene?
♡❤♡DS: Is there anything culturally about Boston that makes it more conducive to folk?
♡❤♡DS: Do you have a favorite curse word?
♡❤♡DS: Really?! You are the first woman I have met who likes that word!
♡❤♡DS: Do you find yourself more inspired by man-made creations, including people and ideas, or nature-made creations?
♡❤♡DS: What are some man made things that inspire you?
♡❤♡DS: Do you think you will return?
♡❤♡DS: What trait do you deplore in yourself?
♡❤♡DS: When is the last time you achieved a goal and were disappointed by it and thought, “Is that all there is?” Something you wanted to obtain, you obtained it, and it wasn’t nearly as fulfilling as you thought it would be.
♡❤♡DS: What is a new goal?
♡❤♡DS: How challenging is it to obtain that in the folk world?
♡❤♡DS: Do you think of doing something less folk-oriented to give your career a push?
♡❤♡DS: More money more problems.
♡❤♡DS: What things did you encounter doing a studio album that you had not foreseen?

<h1>Pilot of Garuda Indonesia Flight 200 speaks out for first time</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Pilot%20of%20Garuda%20Indonesia%20Flight%20200%20speaks%20out%20for%20first%20time&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Marwoto Komar, pilot of &lt;a href="w%3AGaruda%20Indonesia"&gt;Garuda Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGaruda%20Indonesia%20Flight%20200"&gt;Flight 200&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20737"&gt;737-400&lt;/a&gt; which overshot the runway in &lt;a href="w%3AYogyakarta"&gt;Yogyakarta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; on March 7, killing 21, has spoken to the media for the first time about the accident. Five of the deceased were &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n.

"I am deeply, deeply mourning for the victims and for the Australians," Mr Komar told ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANews%20Limited"&gt;News Limited&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. A recent report found his actions to be chiefly responsible for the disaster, finding that he had ignored fifteen automated warnings that he was going too fast, and describing him as fixated with landing. As a result, he is likely to face criminal charges.

Mr Komar broke down outside his &lt;a href="w%3AJakarta"&gt;Jakarta&lt;/a&gt; residence as he told reporters “I didn't plan for this to happen. The point is that I want people to know I am deeply in mourning and also that I understand what the families feel. I just did my job as normal, as usual, flying as a pilot.”

Mr Komar is currently undergoing psychological treatment for mental problems caused by the crash. His flying license has been suspended. "Every day I am here at home, I have never run away. I have explained everything to the KNKT (Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee) and to the police," he said.

Mr Komar said he couldn't comment on technical aspects of the crash, or of the criticisms of his conduct, as the matter is still under police investigation. He is likely to face negligence charges which carry a prison sentence if convicted.

Three other Garuda employees are currently being questioned in &lt;a href="w%3AJakarta"&gt;Jakarta&lt;/a&gt; by police as part of the investigation. They've been told that they are being interrogated as "witnesses".

Meanwhile, Emirsyah Satar, managing director of the airline, has announced an intention to resume flights to Europe next year, assuming success in a current bid to get the airline off the &lt;a href="w%3Alist%20of%20air%20carriers%20banned%20in%20the%20EU"&gt;list of air carriers banned in the EU&lt;/a&gt;, where all Indonesian airlines were placed earlier this year. He suggested &lt;a href="w%3AAmsterdam"&gt;Amsterdam&lt;/a&gt; as the most likely destination.

&lt;a href="w%3AProton%20%28carmaker%29"&gt;Proton&lt;/a&gt;, a car company in &lt;a href="Malaysia"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt; has announced that it plans to begin building a car specifically for &lt;a href="w%3AMuslims"&gt;Muslims&lt;/a&gt;.

They will work with other car makers in &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt; to build an "&lt;a href="w%3AIslam"&gt;Islamic&lt;/a&gt;" car, which would the first car of its kind and will be unlike any other car on the world's market.

"What they (Iran) want to do is to call that an Islamic car. We will identify a car that we can develop and produce it in Malaysia, Iran or Turkey. For Proton, we are more than happy because we have products that we can share," said Syed Zainal Abidin Syed Mohamed Tahir, the chief executive of Proton. The idea was originally proposed by Iran.

Features are to include a compartment for the person's headscarf and &lt;a href="w%3AQur%27an"&gt;Qur'an&lt;/a&gt; as well as a compass that will constantly point in the direction of &lt;a href="w%3AMecca"&gt;Mecca&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Saudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt;.

Currently, &lt;a href="w%3AVolkswagen"&gt;Volkswagen&lt;/a&gt; which is headquartered in &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, is in negotiations to partner with Proton and &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; automaker &lt;a href="w%3AGeneral%20Motors"&gt;General Motors Corporation&lt;/a&gt;. Proton has been posting financial losses, with over &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;160 million lost in 2007 alone.

<h1>Study: kidney damage increasing, patients remain unaware</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Study%3A%20kidney%20damage%20increasing%2C%20patients%20remain%20unaware&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
New research based on data gathered on approximately 28,000 individuals over a 16-year period indicates that even as more people in the &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; are acquiring &lt;a href="w%3Achronic%20kidney%20disease"&gt;chronic kidney disease&lt;/a&gt;, the vast majority of those who are in the early and middle stages of its progression -- when it is most treatable -- have no idea their &lt;a href="w%3Akidney"&gt;kidneys&lt;/a&gt; are weak or damaged until failure is imminent. 

Only 42 percent of study subjects who had Stage 4 kidney disease were aware of it, according to an analysis of data from two National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, conducted by researchers at &lt;a href="w%3AJohns%20Hopkins%20University"&gt;Johns Hopkins University&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ABaltimore"&gt;Baltimore&lt;/a&gt;, Tufts-New England Medical Center in &lt;a href="Boston"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt; and Cleveland Clinic Foundation, and published in the &lt;a href="w%3AJournal%20of%20the%20American%20Medical%20Association"&gt;Journal of the American Medical Association&lt;/a&gt;.

The percentage of people with stage 1 through 4 disease increased from 10.0% in the period 1988-1994 to 13.1% in 1999-2004, mostly due to an increase in &lt;a href="w%3Adiabetes%20mellitus"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AHypertension"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; rates. Stage 5 is &lt;a href="w%3ARenal%20failure"&gt;kidney failure&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href="w%3Adialysis"&gt;dialysis&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3Aorgan%20transplant"&gt;organ transplant&lt;/a&gt; are the only options.

Screening of persons at risk -- those with diabetes, high blood pressure or a family history of kidney problems -- is of utmost importance, said Andrew S. Narva, MD, FACP, director of the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Institutes%20of%20Health"&gt;NIH&lt;/a&gt;'s National Kidney Disease Education Program.

Much can be done to prevent kidney failure if the disease is caught early enough. For example, careful attention to monitoring blood glucose levels, keeping blood pressure under control, and certain prescription medications can be beneficial, according to the NKDEP. Unfortunately, the most commonly performed blood test to look at kidney function, the &lt;a href="w%3Acreatinine"&gt;creatinine&lt;/a&gt; level, has limited precision and needs to be interpreted carefully.

The 13 percent estimate means that some 26 million Americans are thought to have kidney disease, and since risk factors like high blood pressure and diabetes are still increasing, the study raises concerns about future trends of chronic kidney disease and complications. People with kidney disease are at greater risk of hypertension, &lt;a href="w%3AMyocardial%20infarction"&gt;heart attacks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AStroke"&gt;strokes&lt;/a&gt;. They are also more vulnerable to &lt;a href="w%3Aanemia"&gt;anemia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARenal%20osteodystrophy"&gt;bone disease&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Amalnutrition"&gt;malnutrition&lt;/a&gt;.

A top &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; commander said yesterday that the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; is not planning a preemptive attack on &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; despite increasing &lt;a href="w%3Arhetoric"&gt;rhetoric&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="Washington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State"&gt;United States Secretary of State&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Condoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; also denied that an attack was imminent, stating that there is no &lt;a href="w%3ACongress"&gt;Congressional&lt;/a&gt; authorization for military action against Iran.

The denials came as ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Observer"&gt;The Observer&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ ran a report saying that US personnel involved in interrogating insurgents in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; are under "huge" pressure to find evidence against Iran. It quoted Micah Brose, a privately contracted interrogator working for the US military there, as saying that information on Iran is "gold".

"They push a lot for us to establish a link with Iran", Brose claimed in the interview, adding that "it feels a lot like, if you get something and Iran's not involved, it's a let down." He further claimed that people have said to him that "they're really pushing the Iran thing." Brose denied being asked to manufacture evidence, but stated that "if a detainee wants to tell me what I want to hear so he can get out of jail ... you know what I'm saying."

The US has in the past been accused of using exaggerated and fabricated evidence to build its case against Iraq prior to the war.

The article by the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; based newspaper said most military intelligence officers refused to comment but that one said "The message is, 'Got to find a link with Iran, got to find a link with Iran.' It's sickening."

On Monday, &lt;a href="w%3AWilliam%20J.%20Fallon"&gt;Admiral William J. Fallon&lt;/a&gt;, the commanding officer of &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Central%20Command"&gt;United States Central Command&lt;/a&gt; which is responsible for the &lt;a href="Middle%20East"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt;, East &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; and Central &lt;a href="Asia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;, speaking in ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AFinancial%20Times"&gt;Financial Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, said that a strike against Iran is "not in the offing."

"None of this is helped by the continuing stories that just keep going around and around and around that any day now there will be another war which is just not where we want to go," Fallon continued. "Getting Iranian behavior to change and finding ways to get them to come to their senses and do that is the real objective. Attacking them as a means to get to that spot strikes me as being not the first choice in my book." Despite saying this, he refused to rule out a strike against Iran in the future.

Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was on &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Broadcasting%20Company"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt;'s ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThis%20Week%20%28ABC%20TV%20series%29"&gt;This Week&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ on Sunday, saying that a &lt;a href="w%3ASenate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; resolution designating &lt;a href="w%3AArmy%20of%20the%20Guardians%20of%20the%20Islamic%20Revolution"&gt;Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard&lt;/a&gt; as a terrorist organization does not authorize military action.

"There is nothing in this particular resolution that would suggest that from our point of view. And, clearly, the president has also made very clear that he's on a diplomatic path where Iran comes into focus," Rice said.

"This resolution is saying that there needs to be strong measures taken against Iran, which we have definitely done," Rice continued. "And if the Iranians suspend their enrichment and reprocessing, I'm prepared to meet my counterpart anyplace, anytime, anywhere. So the question isn't why will we not talk to Tehran. The question is, why will Tehran not talk to us?"

Senator &lt;a href="Hillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, who is running for &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt;, voted for the resolution. She has said that the resolution could not be used to justify war, but rather it seeks to escalate diplomatic efforts. "We wish to emphasize that no congressional authority exists for unilateral military action against Iran," she said in an open letter on November 1, 2007.

Last week, former Foreign Minister of &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJoschka%20Fischer"&gt;Joschka Fischer&lt;/a&gt; said that he was worried that the upcoming &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202008"&gt;US Presidential election&lt;/a&gt; could heighten tensions between the US and Iran. He found particularly worrisome a statement by Presidential candidate &lt;a href="Rudy%20Giuliani"&gt;Rudy Giuliani&lt;/a&gt; in October that "If I am President of the United States, I guarantee you, we will never find out what they will do if they get nuclear weapons, because they are not going to get a nuclear weapon ... the military option is not off the table."

A huge fire was reported in &lt;a href="w%3AHackney%20Wick"&gt;Hackney Wick&lt;/a&gt; eastern &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;, on part of the &lt;a href="w%3A2012%20Olympic%20Games"&gt;2012 Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt; site scheduled to be the location of the &lt;a href="w%3Ahandball"&gt;handball&lt;/a&gt; courts.

Flames are visible from &lt;a href="w%3ACanary%20Wharf"&gt;Canary Wharf&lt;/a&gt; and the smoke plume is visible across the whole of the City of London. The fire, at a disused single-storey warehouse in Waterden Road, &lt;a href="w%3AStratford"&gt;Stratford&lt;/a&gt;, is said to have been reported around 12:05 &lt;a href="w%3AGreenwich%20Mean%20Time"&gt;GMT&lt;/a&gt;. The Associated Press reports say that a "large explosion" preceded the fire; eyewitnesses do not confirm this, though there is flammable material on the site. David Jones of &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20London%20%28bus%20company%29"&gt;East London Bus company&lt;/a&gt; states that the fire started at a disused warehouse adjacent to their Waterden Road depot.

Eight &lt;a href="w%3Afire%20appliance"&gt;fire appliances&lt;/a&gt; and 40 fire-fighters were initially deployed. The winds carried the smoke over London and reports suggested that the plume of smoke was visible from &lt;a href="w%3ARochester%2C%20Kent"&gt;Rochester, Kent&lt;/a&gt;.

By 13:15 GMT the &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Fire%20Brigade"&gt;London Fire Brigade&lt;/a&gt; reported that there were 15 appliances and around 75 firefighters, and the fire was not yet under control.

Police say they have no evidence of a terrorist attack at this time.

Charles Buchanan of &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20City%20Airport"&gt;London City Airport&lt;/a&gt; told BBC News that the airport was still operational but had closed one runway whose flight path crosses the smoke plume, though services are unaffected. A short stretch of railway close to Hackney Wick was temporarily closed but suffered no damage.

&lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Ambulance%20Service"&gt;London Ambulance Service&lt;/a&gt; confirms that there are no known casualties and their emergency response team has been stood down, though their hazardous area team remains on site. Police are holding back large crowds of bystanders.

In the final of the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Asia%20Series"&gt;Konami Cup 2007&lt;/a&gt;, Chunichi Dragons battled SK Wyverns again, many &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;ese spectators hoped for Dragons to take revenge on Wyverns and win the championship. This was really a intensive match with starting pitchers George Kenneth Rayborn from SK versus Daisuke Yamai.

Even though Byung-kyu Lee hit a 2 runs HR to expand the difference by the 5-2 leading. But Jin-young Lee also hit a 2 runs HR to tie the score with 5-5 at the bottom of 8th.

The key innings took place at the 9th inning, Hirokazu Ibata (Dragons) hit a key run back to make their team lead with 6-5. Finally, the relief pitcher Hitoki Iwase successfully shut down SK's offense and tied the score to the end to win the champion.

With the winning hit at this game, and 4 hits with 7 RBIs in the Konami Cup Asia Series 2007, Hirokazu Ibata was finally chosen to be the MVP.

After this game, Chunichi Dragons coach Hiromitsu Ochiai remarked: "Even though we ever lose to SK Wyverns, but participants in this year proved their actual strength more than last year. In this game, after we led with 6-5, Hitoki Iwase told me he want to pitch at the bottom of 9th inning, then I accepted, he promised his wish and finally helped us win the champion. I'll not forget the contributions by Ibata and Iwase."

"A healthy life starts from Walking." With this quote advertised on TV commercials in &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;, 25 divisions in Taiwan simultaneously held the walking events of "Taiwan Walking Day" yesterday. This recreational activity by Sports Affairs Council (SAC) and Ministry of Health (MOH) of Executive Yuan R.O.C. is the 2nd national event after the "Taiwan National Bicycle Day" promoted by SAC on May 5 this year.

In the main arena of the Taipei Municipal Chungshan Football Stadium, with the conjunction of "2007 Taiwan Walking Festival" by Republic of China Alpine Association held at Saturday (Nov. 10), this national event in Taipei attracted more than 5 thousand people including VIPs from "2007 Master Forum on Walking in Taiwan", worldwide walking and mountaineering professionals, and local public figures.

"Walking is a good recreation sport for health, to promote good conceptions on health, we (MOH) will present several books for the participants to make them manage their health well." Sheng-mao Ho (Ministry of Health) told the media. By the way, to promote advantages of recreation sports and health improvement, Jongher Yang (Commissioner of SAC) hopes the public will change the greeting from "Have you eaten yet?" to "Have you done sports yet?".

During the national event, the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Police%20Agency%20%28Taiwan%29"&gt;Police Radio System&lt;/a&gt; in Taiwan had a live radio SNG to some participated divisions, and some magistrate hoped the public would do more recreational sports to fullfil the goal of "Taiwan Walking Day".

<h2>Day 4: Australia set records in single game</h2>
It was a merciless massacre as Australia &lt;a href="w%3AMercy_rule%23Baseball_and_softball"&gt;mercy-ruled&lt;/a&gt; Thailand with a shellacking of 26-1, echoing the Rangers' 30-3 rout of the Orioles' this August. In addition to the remarkable disparity in runs, Australia also singlehandedly set four BWC records:
<ul>
BULLET::::- Most runs in a game: 26
BULLET::::- Largest run differential in a game: 25
BULLET::::- Most runs in an inning: 12 in the top of 3rd.
BULLET::::- Most hits in a game: 30

</ul>
Yet this rout only featured one home run, a 2-run shot by the Australian infielder Glenn Williams.

<h2>Day 5: Australia and Cuba qualify for Quarter Final</h2>
<h3>Cuba vs Venezuela</h3>
If Cuba can defeat Venezuela, they can not only keep their winning streak intact but also qualify for the Quarter Final of the 2007 BWC. And they did it in style as starter Yadel Marti almost had a perfect game if it were not for Lino Connell's (Venezuela) single in the bottom of 7th. Cuba eventually &lt;a href="w%3AMercy_rule%23Baseball_and_softball"&gt;ended the game early&lt;/a&gt; with a score of 10-0.
<h3>Australia wins thriller against S Korea</h3>
This game developed into a pitching duel as both sides only managed to score one run going into the 9th. Yet the Aussies took care of business in the bottom half when infielder Ben Risinger belted a walk-off hit as Australia beat S Korea, 2-1.

<h2>Day 6: Host edges Italy in controversy</h2>
This pitching duel took place between James Anthony Fiore, formerly of the La New Bears, and &lt;a href="w%3AEn-Yu%20Lin"&gt;En-yu Lin&lt;/a&gt;, an ex-Macoto Cobra. They completely shut down their opponent's offense as two teams were held scoreless for the first 8 innings.

Two disputed calls came in the 9th. In the top of the inning, the Italian baserunner appeared to beat the throw at the 3rd base by the Chinese Taipei right fielder, but the umpire from S Korea stll called him out. The other came in the bottom half. With 2 outs, Chih-sheng Lin seemed to have swung the bat, yet the 1st base umpire from Japan called no swing. This controversial call eventually determined the outcome of the game as Lin won the game, 1-0, with a walk-off hit. Even though Chinese Taipei won this game, many spectators and internet users from Taiwan heavily criticized Chinese Taipei and left harsh comments on the official websites such as "What a SHAME Taiwanese!", casting a shadow of mistrust upon this questionably called game.

A fierce storm on Sunday resulted in massive 18-foot waves, which split a &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aoil%20tanker"&gt;oil tanker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in two and sank two Russian &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Afreighter"&gt;freighters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; nearby. The tanker &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOil%20spill"&gt;spilled&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at least 560,000 gallons of fuel into a strait which leads to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABlack%20Sea"&gt;Black Sea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and officials say it may take years to clean up. The tankers sank in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStrait%20of%20Kerch"&gt;Strait of Kerch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which links the Black Sea and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASea%20of%20Azov"&gt;Sea of Azov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the northeast. The two ships were carrying a total of around 7,150 tons of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Asulfur"&gt;sulfur&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , according to Sergei Petrov, Russia's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMinistry%20of%20Emergency%20Situations"&gt;Ministry of Emergency Situations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; regional spokesperson.

The tanker was carrying nearly 1.3 million &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Agallon"&gt;gallons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Afuel%20oil"&gt;fuel oil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and was stranded several miles from shore. Emergency workers were prevented from collecting the spilled oil immediately due to stormy weather; the head of the state environmental safety watchdog Rosprorodnadzor, Oleg Mitvol, said "there is serious concern that the spill will continue". Workers eventually managed to begin work on cleaning up the spill, an effort which may be long-term. Tar-like sands laden with oil and seaweed were piled on the shore, while oil-covered birds in slick-covered water tried to flap their wings. Regional coast guard officer Anatoly Yanhuck said once weather improves they will begin pumping oil from the tanker, then tow the ship to port.

Two fuel-loaded barges and &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt; freighter ♡❤Ziya Kos♡❤ also ran aground in the area, but there was no further environmental damage, said Petrov. Ten ships altogether were sunk or run aground in the area of the Black Sea near the Straight of Kerch and the Straight itself; a Russian freighter carrying metal was also reported as having sunk near the port of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASevastopol"&gt;Sevastopol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on &lt;a href="Ukraine"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACrimean%20Peninsula"&gt;Crimean Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . 

One of the sulfur-carrying freighters reported three crew members as drowned, and five more as missing, while two members of the sunk freighter carrying metal were reported as drowned and another remains missing. The oil tanker's 13 crew members were all rescued safely, and all members of the second freighter were also reported as safe. 

Captains had been warned Saturday morning of the stormy conditions, regional prosecutor Maxim Stepanenko told Russia's Vesti 24. The oil tanker was not built to withstand fierce storms, having been designed to transport oil on rivers during &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASoviet%20Union"&gt;Soviet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; times, he said. 

Chemist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOffice%20of%20Oceanic%20and%20Atmospheric%20Research"&gt;Ocean Service office&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of response and restoration, Jim Farr said the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Asulfur"&gt;sulfur&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; spill from the two freighters wouldn't create a "hazardous situation", a statement backed up by Alexei Zhukovin, expert with the Emergency Situations Ministry's branch in Southern Russia. Although on land sulfur is used as a fungicide, in a marine setting it wouldn't act as one, said Farr; instead a sulfur spill can be compared to dumping sand on a reef and smothering it, or placing a blanket on a bed of grass. Long-term effects are more difficult to speculate on, however, without better knowledge of the area and its currents. Oleg Mitvol said that although the sulfur spill doesn't present an environmental danger, the two freighters might also leak fuel oil from their tanks, adding to the pollution.

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; interrogators have claimed that they are under pressure to find incriminating evidence against &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; when they interview Iraqi &lt;a href="w%3AInsurgent"&gt;insurgents&lt;/a&gt;, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Observer"&gt;The Observer&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reported on Sunday.

Micah Brose, a privately contracted interrogator working for the US military in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, told the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; newspaper that information about Iran is "gold".

"They push a lot for us to establish a link with Iran (when interrogating prisoners)", he claimed in the interview, adding that "it feels a lot like, if you get something and Iran's not involved, it's a let down." He further claimed that people have said to him that "they're really pushing the Iran thing". Brose denied being asked to manufacture evidence, but stated that "if a detainee wants to tell me what I want to hear so he can get out of jail ... you know what I'm saying."

The US government accuses Iran of arming insurgents in neighbouring Iraq, and refuses to rule out military action against Iran for its alleged attempts to build nuclear weapons. In the past the US has been accused of using exaggerated and fabricated evidence to build its case against Iraq prior to the war.

♡❤The Observer♡❤ article, which has not been picked up by any other mainstream news agency (but reported in Iran), also quoted a military intelligence officer as saying that "The message is, 'Got to find a link with Iran, got to find a link with Iran.' It's sickening."

<h1>H5N1 strain of Avian Flu found in the UK</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=H5N1%20strain%20of%20Avian%20Flu%20found%20in%20the%20UK&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Officials also say that it is likely that the virus arrived in the U.K. by way of migrating birds and that the virus resembles the H5N1 strain that was discovered in August in &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;. Other possibilities of infection are currently being investigated by officials such as infected turkey food or being brought overseas by humans.

"Everybody needs to be concerned, this is avian influenza. We are asking every poultry keeper to be vigilant, to house their birds where they are required to do so in any restricted area and carry out good bio-security measures and report any signs of disease. This is a particularly challenging site and our priority is to adhere to strict bio-security, and the health and safety of staff on site is paramount," said Fred Landeg, a chief officer of veterinary medicine.

Health officials say that all of the birds on the farm, at least 5,000 ducks geese and turkeys, will be killed, most of which already have been. They have also designated a radius of three (1.9 miles) kilometers from the farm, a "protection zone" and are monitoring the situation from at least a 10 k.m. (6 mile) radius of the farm to attempt to prevent the spread of the disease. It is not known if the virus has spread beyond the farm. All cars entering and exiting the area are reportedly being sprayed with a disinfectant. Birds on farms nearby are being kept indoors and away from any other wild birds.
"We will be looking at the movements on to the premises and off the premises of birds and movements of people, vehicles and things, to see whether there is another origin somewhere in the country or whether the disease could have spread," added Landeg.

Officials also say that the commission for the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; have been notified.

In April of 2006, the deadly H5N1 virus was found in the remains of a wild &lt;a href="w%3AMute%20Swan"&gt;Mute Swan&lt;/a&gt; in the village of &lt;a href="w%3ACellardyke"&gt;Cellardyke&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AFife"&gt;Fife&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AScotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;. In February, poultry producer Bernard Matthews' farm in Suffolk had more than 160,000 birds killed after they were infected with the H5N1 virus.

Other deadly diseases have recently took a hold on the U.K. and farmers. An outbreak of &lt;a href="w%3Abluetongue%20disease"&gt;bluetongue disease&lt;/a&gt; was reported last September, while &lt;a href="w%3Afoot-and-mouth%20disease"&gt;foot-and-mouth disease&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20United%20Kingdom%20foot-and-mouth%20outbreak"&gt;reemerged in August&lt;/a&gt; after a breach in biosecurity at a U.K. research laboratory.

&lt;a href="w%3AAugustus%20F.%20Hawkins"&gt;Augustus Freeman Hawkins&lt;/a&gt;, a prominent U.S. figure in Civil Rights and Organized Labor history, has died at the age of 100, just three days ago, on November 10.

Born on August 31, 1907, &lt;a href="w%3AShreveport"&gt;Shreveport&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALouisiana"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;, he served as the first &lt;a href="w%3AAfrican%20American"&gt;African American&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Congress"&gt;United States Congress&lt;/a&gt;, where he sponsored the &lt;a href="w%3AHumphrey-Hawkins%20Full%20Employment%20Act"&gt;Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act&lt;/a&gt;.

Hawkins was a Democratic member of the &lt;a href="w%3A%20State%20Assembly"&gt;State Assembly&lt;/a&gt; in 1935 to 1963; he was also a delegate to the National Conventions of 1940, 1944 and 1960 and a California Presidential Elector in the 1944 Election. Hawkins attended high school in &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, and received his undergraduate degree from the &lt;a href="w%3AUCLA"&gt;UCLA&lt;/a&gt; in 1931.

During 1963 to 1991, he represented California's 21st District (1963-75), and 29th District (1975-1991), in Congress. Early in his congressional career, he authored including the Title VII of the Civil Rights Act establishing the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Job Training Partnership Act, and the School Improvement Act. He was a founding member of the &lt;a href="w%3ACongressional%20Black%20Caucus"&gt;Congressional Black Caucus&lt;/a&gt;. As chair of the House Education and Labor Committee, he sponsored the Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act, alongside Senator &lt;a href="w%3AHubert%20Humphrey"&gt;Hubert Humphrey&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AMinnesota"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;. The Bill gave the U.S. government the goal to provide full employment; it also ordered that the Chairman of the &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Reserve%20Board"&gt;Federal Reserve Board&lt;/a&gt; must give a Congressional testimony on the economy.

Over his career, Hawkins authored more than 300 state and federal laws. He also succeeded in restoring honorable discharges to the 170 black soldiers of the 25th Infantry Regiment who had been falsely accused of a public disturbance in Brownsville, Texas, in 1906, and removed from the Army.

Hawkins retired in 1991 to his &lt;a href="w%3A%20Los%20Angeles"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; home, and lived in &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; for the remainder of his life.

This week in &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AIntel"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt; and other technology companies showcased server and computer hardware with processors built using "&lt;a href="w%3ACore%202%23Penryn"&gt;Penryn&lt;/a&gt;" technology, the second generation of &lt;a href="w%3AMulti-core%20%28computing%29"&gt;quad core&lt;/a&gt; technology that is produced with the &lt;a href="w%3AHigh-k%20dielectric"&gt;high-k&lt;/a&gt; metal &lt;a href="w%3AHafnium"&gt;Hafnium&lt;/a&gt; that has come to replace &lt;a href="w%3Ahalogen"&gt;halogen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Alead"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt; components, which are not environmentally safe.

This new &lt;a href="w%3A45%20nanometer"&gt;45 nanometer&lt;/a&gt; (45nm) process technology included features on Intel Streaming SIMD Extensions 4 (&lt;a href="w%3ASSE4"&gt;SSE4&lt;/a&gt;) compatible with video decoding (encoding) software, "Radix 16" which increased computing efficiency, and "deep power down" technology for energy efficiency. For the SSE4 feature, this will benefit makers of high-definition and AV-media, as both &lt;a href="w%3AHDMI"&gt;HDMI&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3A1080p"&gt;1080p&lt;/a&gt; are supported.

Companies that will participate in the Taiwan Informonth exhibition next month, announced that some products with "Penryn" processors will be on the market by then. Some companies like &lt;a href="w%3ATyan"&gt;Tyan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASupermicro"&gt;Supermicro&lt;/a&gt; will provide small business solutions as well as enterprises solutions. This launch will be tied to other unveilings by the IT and AV-media industries in Taiwan.

♡❤♡DS: &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AProfessor%20Venerable%20Samdhong%20Rinpoche"&gt;Professor Venerable Samdhong Rinpoche&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was elected the head of the Tibetan Administration cabinet--effectively a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aprime%20minister"&gt;prime minister&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Tibetan%20Administration"&gt;Central Tibetan Administration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the government-in-exile?
♡❤♡DS: Retired from administrative functions?
♡❤♡DS: The Dalai Lama exists as a spiritual leader and essentially a figurehead, similar to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AQueen%20Elizabeth%20II"&gt;Queen Elizabeth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ?
♡❤♡DS: As an autonomous region.
♡❤♡DS: He’s a symbolic head of the people, whereas Rinpoche would be an administrative head? I understand you may want to shy away from using government-oriented terminology.
♡❤♡DS: What would be some of the first actions the Dalai Lama would undertake if he were to return to Tibet?
♡❤♡DS: What are the functions or responsibilities of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AForeign%20relations%20of%20Tibet"&gt;Office of Tibet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the Americas?

<h2>The Chinese invasion and occupation</h2>
♡❤♡DS: How many Tibetans were lost during the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-forced-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGenocides%20in%20history%23Tibet"&gt;Reign of Terror&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; directly after the Chinese invasion?
♡❤♡DS: How has the Chinese government’s &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20China%20Development"&gt;Western China Development&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; program affected ordinary &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATibetan%20people"&gt;Tibetans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ?
♡❤♡DS: The phrase used to describe this by the exiled Tibetan government is “Chinese Apartheid?”
♡❤♡DS: How are the local people handling this situation?
♡❤♡DS: But that's not possible.
♡❤♡DS: Why?
♡❤♡DS: Have any spoken out as to why they were dismissed?

<h2>Tibetan reaction to the Dalai Lama's Congressional Gold Medal</h2>

♡❤♡DS: What happened when the Dalai Lama received the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACongressional%20Gold%20Medal"&gt;Congressional Gold Medal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ?
♡❤♡DS: Was there a crackdown?
♡❤♡DS: What is the status of the monks who were arrested after the Dalai Lama received the Congressional Gold Medal? 
♡❤♡DS: At the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADrepung%20Monastery"&gt;Drepung Monastery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ?
♡❤♡DS: How difficult is it to receive information from Tibet?
♡❤♡DS: Do you know the situation with Ronggay A'drak, the Tibetan nomad who was arrested?
♡❤♡DS: What will happen to him?
♡❤♡DS: Is that standard?

<h2>The disappearance of Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, the eleventh Panchen Lama</h2>
♡❤♡DS: Where is Chadrel Rinpoche, the man who selected &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGedhun%20Choekyi%20Nyima"&gt;Gedhun Choekyi Nyima&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as the eleventh &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APanchen%20Lama"&gt;Panchen Lama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ?
♡❤♡DS: Does anyone?
♡❤♡DS: The Chinese government knew he was in touch with the Dalai Lama over the selection?
♡❤♡DS: So at age six, Gedhun Choekyi Nyima just disappeared?
♡❤♡DS: And nobody knows where he is.
♡❤♡DS: What do you think will happen to him?
♡❤♡DS: Do you think he is aware of his status?
♡❤♡DS: But at six years of age, it is probable he was not able to completely comprehend the fight between the two governments over who he was and what role he is to play. If they were to take him at the age of six and place him somewhere in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AManchuria"&gt;Manchuria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , re-educate him and deny him his heritage, it is possible he does not even know who he is?
♡❤♡DS: There have been no rumors, no words through the grapevine as to his status?
♡❤♡DS: That’s pretty amazing when you consider it.
♡❤♡DS: What do you think is the thinking on the part of the Chinese government that this six year old boy would be a threat to their power?
♡❤♡DS: It would seem that by the Chinese government installing their own person, they have created their own symbol of illegitimacy as opposed to allowing religious practice to happen whilst keeping their governmental authority intact. They have created a symbol in the form of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGyancain%20Norbu"&gt;Gyancain Norbu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of their illegitimacy and meddling in the cultural affairs.

<h2>Gyancain Norbu, the boy selected by the Chinese government</h2>
♡❤♡DS: Do you think &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGyancain%20Norbu"&gt;Gyancain Norbu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the boy the Chinese government selected as the eleventh Panchen Lama, is a victim as well?
♡❤♡DS: What would be the right decision?

♡❤♡DS: But if he insists on his status as the Panchen Lama?
♡❤♡DS: But he has no legitimacy now as the Panchen Lama, where as the one the Dalai Lama selected ♡❤does♡❤ have that legitimacy, is that correct?
♡❤♡DS: Gyancain Norbu has not made any statements?
♡❤♡DS: What do the Tibetan people think about him?
♡❤♡DS: But they are against what he represents.
♡❤♡DS: He’s not towing the party line but just keeping quiet.
♡❤♡DS: So in a sense he is a victim himself?

<h2>The selection of the next Dalai Lama</h2>
♡❤♡DS: In September the Chinese government has said they must approve all high monks—
♡❤♡DS: How will it affect the choosing of the next Dalai Lama?
♡❤♡DS: How do they force the public?
♡❤♡DS: How do they keep track of that?
♡❤♡DS: Did the Dalai Lama support &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIndia%20and%20weapons%20of%20mass%20destruction"&gt;India’s nuclear testing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ?

<h2>The views of the Dalai Lama</h2>
♡❤♡DS: What is His Holiness’ view on &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aabortion"&gt;abortion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ?
♡❤♡DS: He believes that it should be a personal decision and not a governmental decision?

♡❤♡DS: But that it’s frowned upon as a Buddhist principle?
♡❤♡DS: What are His Holiness’ views on homosexuality?
♡❤♡DS: So if somebody is &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHomosexuality%20and%20Buddhism"&gt;gay they could not be a proper Buddhist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ?
♡❤♡DS: Have you ever killed an insect?
♡❤♡DS: Is the Dalai Lama planning on visiting Latin America any time soon?
♡❤♡DS: It’s likely next year?
♡❤♡DS: Do you know why the Dalai Lama has not explicitly said he is a reincarnation of the Dalai Lama?
♡❤♡DS: It’s that he believes he is a reincarnation, but whether he is the whole and sum of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A13th%20Dalai%20Lama"&gt;13th Dalai Lama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is another question?
♡❤♡DS: Do you have thoughts to share on the situation in &lt;a href="Burma"&gt;Burma&lt;/a&gt;?
♡❤♡DS: Have you any information on their current status?
♡❤♡DS: It’s such a difficult region with many complex disputes.
♡❤♡DS: All over &lt;a href="Asia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt; so many people have long-lasting conflicts and memories never seem to die.

<h2>Arunachal Pradesh, an historically Tibetan area of India claimed by China</h2>
♡❤♡DS: What is your view on &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AArunachal%20Pradesh"&gt;Arunachal Pradesh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ? Is the Government-in-Exile's relative silence over the issue due more to a recognition of India as a friendly government, or does the Government-in-Exile view the area as less Tibetan than the areas controlled by China?

<h2>Shugden worship</h2>
♡❤♡DS: &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChristopher%20Hitchens"&gt;Christopher Hitchens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; criticized the Dalai Lama for his supposed suppression of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADorje%20Shugden"&gt;Shugden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; worship?
♡❤♡DS: Was Lozang Gyatso, the director of Institute of Buddhist Dialectics murdered by Shugden worshipers?

<h2>Karmapa controversy</h2>
♡❤♡DS: What is the reason for the Dalai Lama's decision to become involved in the dispute over the identity of the current &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKarmapa%20controversy"&gt;Karmapa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; [♡❤the leader of the largest sub-school of one of the four main schools in Tibetan Buddhism - ed.♡❤] by endorsing one candidate? 
♡❤♡DS: By all sides?
♡❤♡DS: Does he still play a role as a peacemaker?
♡❤♡DS: Do you think &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOgyen%20Trinley%20Dorje"&gt;Ogyen Trinley Dorje&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; [♡❤one of the two contestants in the Karmapa dispute - ed.♡❤] will be able to travel freely to visit his followers?

Conservative &lt;a href="w%3Aevangelical"&gt;evangelical&lt;/a&gt; preacher &lt;a href="w%3APat%20Robertson"&gt;Pat Robertson&lt;/a&gt; has endorsed &lt;a href="Rudy%20Giuliani"&gt;Rudy Giuliani&lt;/a&gt;'s bid for the 2008 U.S. Presidential election.

Robertson said that he was supporting the former &lt;a href="New%20York%2C%20New%20York"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; mayor, despite their disagreements on social issues, because Giuliani was the best hope for the United States against "the blood lust of Islamic terrorists". Robertson said that Giuliani was a "proven leader who is not afraid of what lies ahead, and who will cast a hopeful vision for all Americans." Although Robertson's influence in the religious right is not as strong as it once was, his endorsement is still important to Republican candidates. 

Giuliani is pro-choice while Robertson is pro-life. Giuliani also favors extending rights to gays although does not favor allowing gay marriage. Giuliani has had a turbulent family life. Giuliani is on his third marriage and after one divorce was living with two gay roommates. The Religious Right in the United States, including Robertson, often emphasizes what they call traditional family values and frown on divorce and non-standard home arrangements.

The religious right in the United States has been under stress in this election over whom to support. &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Dobson"&gt;James Dobson&lt;/a&gt;, another prominent and controversial evangelical leader has warned that although the Religious Right has for a long time supported the Republican Party, they may vote for a third party candidate if the Republican Party Presidential candidate does not share their views on social issues.

<h1>Iran reveals nuclear designs to IAEA</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Iran%20reveals%20nuclear%20designs%20to%20IAEA&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

According to reports, the &lt;a href="International%20Atomic%20Energy%20Agency"&gt;International Atomic Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt; (IAEA) has received copies of documents detailing the nuclear designs for &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;'s nuclear program. Its is reported that some of those designs could be used to produce a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Anuclear%20bomb"&gt;nuclear bomb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

According to the reports, within the documents are instructions on how to "cast &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Auranium"&gt;uranium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; metal" into the shape of a warhead, which are often used on nuclear bombs.

Iran does not deny the documents existence, but said that it received the documents during times when they bought nuclear material on the black market, without being asked if they wanted them or not.

The IAEA, which came across the documents when investigating the nuclear activities of Iran, first asked for the information and designs in 2005. Iranian officials say that IAEA inspectors are permitted to go to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATehran"&gt;Tehran&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to view the original document. They had previously denied the IAEA a copy or examination of the document.

<h1>FBI document reviews symbols used by pedophiles</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=FBI%20document%20reviews%20symbols%20used%20by%20pedophiles&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

In an exclusive report, ♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ has obtained an internal &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; document from ♡❤&lt;a href="Wikileaks"&gt;Wikileaks&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ detailing symbols used by organized &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Apedophile"&gt;pedophiles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to identify one another. 

Wikileaks obtained the document via &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; "childhood erotica" networks. According to Wikileaks, the unclassified parts of the document were only briefly published by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAnn%20Arbor%2C%20Michigan"&gt;Ann Arbor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Michigan"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt; police department in a newsletter, which was later removed from the internet.

The document, which is titled ♡❤Symbols and Logos Used by Pedophiles to Identify Sexual Preferences♡❤ states that "pedophiles, to include those who sexually abuse children as well as those who produce, distribute, and trade child pornography, are using various types of identification logos or symbols to recognize one another and distinguish their sexual preferences."

According to the FBI, there are at least three groups that pedophiles can use to identify what age and or gender they prefer such as "boylove, girllove and childlove." Most of the logos have been found to be printed on coins, necklace charms and rings.

The first logo, 'The BoyLover logo' (BLogo) "is a small blue spiral-shaped triangle surrounded by a larger triangle, whereby the small triangle represents a small boy and the larger triangle represents an adult man. A variation of the BLogo is the Little Boy Lover logo (LBLogo), which also embodies a small spiral-shaped triangle within a larger triangle; however, the corners of the LBLogo are rounded to resemble a scribbling by a young child," said the document.

The second logo, 'The GirlLover logo' (GLogo) is "a small heart surrounded by a larger heart, which symbolizes a relationship between an adult male or female and minor girl," the document stated.

The last logo, 'The ChildLover logo' (CLogo), "resembles a butterfly and represents non-preferential gender child abusers," added the document.

It is not known how the document came to be in the hands of Spanish childhood erotica enthusiasts. The logos were found during raids on computers and other items related to pedophile investigations.

In an exclusive report, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ has obtained documents via ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWikileaks"&gt;Wikileaks&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that state &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt; and or single interest groups is planning to attack the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; homeland within three years, this according to a 27-page internally distributed memo circulated by the U.S. &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Homeland%20Security"&gt;Department of Homeland Security&lt;/a&gt; (DHS) on the threat of al-Qaeda. The document also details al-Qaeda's threat in other parts of the world including &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;. ♡❤Wikileaks♡❤ claims that the report was published on October 22, 2007.

"Al-Qaeda is intent in striking the U.S. homeland and the U.S. will face a persistent and evolving terrorist threat over the next three years. Al-Qaeda homeland plotting is likely to continue to focus on prominent political, economic, and infrastructure targets. Lebanese Hezbollah may (also) attempt to attack the Homeland and non-muslim, 'single-issue' groups will probably conduct attacks," stated the report which also said that likely targets include the "mass transit sector and the aviation sectors."

The alleged attacks include "mass casualties, visually dramatic destruction, significant economic aftershocks and fear amongst the U.S. population" using "&lt;a href="w%3AImprovised%20explosive%20device"&gt;improvised explosives&lt;/a&gt;, carried or vehicle borne. Existence of radical, self-generating cells suggest that the U.S. is not immune to what we judge as an expanding radical and violent segment in the west," added the report.

Retailers across the U.S. have also reported to law enforcement agencies that customers purchasing cellular phones "visited multiple locations and purchased hundreds or thousands of phones, attempted to conceal their identity, were described as &lt;a href="Middle%20East"&gt;Middle Eastern&lt;/a&gt; and used gift cards or cash."

"DHS and &lt;a href="w%3AFBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; assessed that most individuals engaged in such purchases were taking advantage of discounted prices in the U.S.and reselling the phones for profit overseas. DHS and the FBI also determined some buyers were associated to terrorist networks. The suspected motive was fundraising." Some of these activities were recorded as far back as 2006.

In regards to Iraq, al-Qaeda "is committed to removing U.S. and Coalition troops and returning Iraq to an Islamic state governed with Shari’a law. In &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; they "sought mergers with groups in to further its agenda and has made frequent statements on the importance of &lt;a href="w%3ASudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Somalia"&gt;Somalia&lt;/a&gt; as fronts in the global &lt;a href="w%3Ajihad"&gt;jihad&lt;/a&gt;. And in Afghanistan is their "former safehaven and a key component of their strategy in promoting a global jihad."

The report also states that the DHS has investigated a "serious" claim that the &lt;a href="w%3AFort%20Peck%20Dam"&gt;Fort Peck Dam&lt;/a&gt; will "be attacked by an &lt;a href="w%3AImprovised%20explosive%20device"&gt;improvised explosive device&lt;/a&gt; (IED) in January 2008." It also investigated a claim that "10,000 lbs. of &lt;a href="w%3Aammonium%20nitrate"&gt;ammonium nitrate&lt;/a&gt; was reportedly stolen from a truck driver," but the DHS states that both claims "were found to be not terrorism related."

The report also adds that the DHS "lacks credible information to indicate planning for an attack against the Food and Agriculture sector," but also states that they will continue to investigate the possibility of a threat.

To conclude the report, the DHS states that there is no current information to suggest an imminent attack on the U.S..

"[There has been an] interesting convergence of incidents; but no definite terrorism nexus" and there is no "discernable patterns or trends emerged to date to suggest preoperational activity."

Before the Quarter Final of &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Baseball%20World%20Cup"&gt;2007 Baseball World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, there had some conflicts and disputes at last 2 days' group qualification.
<h2>Netherlands ended Cuba's winning-streak legend</h2>
Formerly, &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; wasn't afraid of Cuba's strength because they ever won Cuba with 4-2 at 2000 Sydney Olympics, and competed with &lt;a href="Cuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt; to a 11-innings' extra match, though they finally lost with Cuba's winning hit.

Before the 8th inning of this match, a pitching competition tied this game with 1-1. But in the bottom of 8th inning, Sharnol Adriana hit a key hit with 1 RBI when Cuba's relief pitcher Jonder Martinez was in a unsteady condition. With this key RBI, Netherlands finally ended Cuba's legend by winning this game with 2-1.
<h2>A simple game faded with some political bullies' entrances in Taichung</h2>
The host team (&lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Chinese Taipei&lt;/a&gt;) battled USA in &lt;a href="w%3ATaichung"&gt;Taichung&lt;/a&gt; with a fantastic batting game, but in the side of this game, some councilors from &lt;a href="w%3ATaichung%20City"&gt;Taichung City&lt;/a&gt; and supporters from councilors bully entered the stadium with illegal privileges. After this scandal spread out to Taichung City Government, Jason Hu, the Mayor of Taichung, angered on this scandal and ordered polices and organizations from 2007 BWC investigating this scandal with justice.

<h2>Mexico replaced Panama's qualification due to problems of Panama's insurance premium</h2>
According to &lt;a href="w%3AIBAF"&gt;IBAF&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMLB"&gt;MLB&lt;/a&gt;, if one or more MLB players participate international games like BWC or Intercontinental Cup, affiliated teams with those (MLB) players should pay the insurance premium to complete the registration before the start of every game. But Panama Team was confiscated the winning to Spain because they (Panama) didn't pay the premium at a match to Spain. IBAF finally judged Spain won Panama with 9A-0 by this violation. Comparison to the fixtures and statistics, Panama was eliminated and Mexico Team replaced Panama's qualification at Group A.

&lt;a href="Baseball"&gt;Baseball&lt;/a&gt; home-run leader &lt;a href="w%3ABarry%20Bonds"&gt;Barry Bonds&lt;/a&gt; was indicted today in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20district%20court"&gt;District Court&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;. The charges of &lt;a href="w%3Aperjury"&gt;perjury&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aobstruction%20of%20justice"&gt;obstruction of justice&lt;/a&gt; stem from Bonds's testimony that he did not knowingly take &lt;a href="w%3Asteroid"&gt;steroids&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href="w%3Agrand%20jury"&gt;grand jury&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href="w%3ABay%20Area%20Laboratory%20Co-operative"&gt;BALCO scandal&lt;/a&gt;. 
Evidence was allegedly obtained during the investigation that included a positive test for performance-enhancing substances. Bonds, currently a &lt;a href="w%3Afree%20agent"&gt;free agent&lt;/a&gt;, still denies using steroids.

The indictment said: "During the criminal investigation, evidence was obtained including positive tests for the presence of anabolic steroids and other performance-enhancing substances for Bonds and other professional athletes."

If Bonds is convicted of all four counts of &lt;a href="w%3Aperjury"&gt;perjury&lt;/a&gt; and one count of &lt;a href="w%3Aobstruction%20of%20justice"&gt;obstruction of justice&lt;/a&gt;, he could face up to 20 to 30 years in &lt;a href="w%3Aprison"&gt;prison&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>Cyclone Sidr kills hundreds in Bangladesh</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Cyclone%20Sidr%20kills%20hundreds%20in%20Bangladesh&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Powerful &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACyclone%20Sidr"&gt;Cyclone Sidr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; battered &lt;a href="Bangladesh"&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;, killing hundreds of people, though reports vary. Citing the local ♡❤United News of Bangladesh♡❤, the ♡❤Associated Press♡❤ is reporting a death toll of 1,100. 

An evacuation of some 3 million was attempted before the storm made landfall. Anjana Pasricha reported from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Delhi"&gt;New Delhi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVOA%20News"&gt;VOA News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that, officials say advance preparation saved many lives, in a country accustomed to natural disasters.

Officials say the cyclone crashed into the country's southern coast Thursday night with winds of up to 240 kilometers an hour, triggering huge waves. 

Many villages were devastated as the winds uprooted trees and flattened homes. Torrential rain and waves washed away crops. Officials say many of the victims were killed by falling trees or debris from collapsing homes.

Shail Shrestha, program coordinator for the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Red%20Cross%20and%20Red%20Crescent%20Movement"&gt;Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in Dhaka, said preliminary reports indicate that the devastation is widespread.

"Phone lines are cut and communication system is very much disrupted, said Shrestha. "Agriculture products are badly damaged and livestock are also badly damaged."

The worst of the storm was over by early Friday. This made it possible for government and volunteer teams to dispatch relief teams carrying food, water, medicines, and tents for the people in the affected districts. 

Although the storm has caused considerable destruction, officials say a mass evacuation ordered in advance helped save many lives. 

Hundreds of thousands of coastal villagers were evacuated into government-built cyclone shelters and other buildings as the storm approached. 

The shelters were built after the low-lying country suffered massive casualties in previous cyclones. A storm that hit the country in 1970 killed about half a million people. Another cyclone in 1991 killed more than 130,000.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChittagong"&gt;Chittagong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is one of the districts that lay in the path of the storm. A senior district official, Mokhlesur Rahman, says the region was spared large-scale casualties. 

"We did evacuate a lot of people into different cyclone shelters, some in educational institutions," said Rahman. "It was of much help, evacuation…. Now they are going back home."

&lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;'s east coast was also bracing for the cyclone, but so far it has escaped the storm's fury. Authorities reported that several areas were hit by heavy rain, but there was little damage.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOral%20Roberts"&gt;Oral Roberts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , founder and former &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Afaith%20healer"&gt;faith healer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , called an "emergency meeting" to reinstate &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Roberts%20%28evangelist%29"&gt;Richard Roberts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as president of &lt;a href="Oral%20Roberts%20University"&gt;Oral Roberts University&lt;/a&gt;. Richard stepped down last month when he was accused of illegal political contributions, financial wrong-doing, and wrongful firings in a lawsuit. 

On Wednesday Oral called an 'emergency meeting' for the faculty following the previous "no confidence" vote. At the recent meeting Oral asked for the faculty who were willing to forgive and start fresh to "stand up." Donald Vance, a professor of Bible studies, said that when no one person at the meeting stood, Oral Roberts asked one of them, "'Are you not ready to start over?'" 

Vance reported, "The faculty member said, "I don't know what that means, to start over." 

"'I would think that would be obvious,'" Oral Roberts responded.

After that, Vance stated "No, Chancellor Roberts, it's not clear, are you asking us to rescind our three motions?" Then Oral Roberts said that the faculty should drop it.

Following the meeting Provost Mark Lewandoswki wrote a letter to ORU Board of Regents promising to step down if Richard Roberts returns as president. ♡❤Tulsa World♡❤ reported that the atompshere at ORU is "divise" noting that when Regent chairman &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Pearsons"&gt;George Pearsons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , took his position in May he said in an address to the board: "I am standing here today because the Lord clearly spoke to me and said, ‘Do whatever Richard Roberts asks you to do.'"

The school declined to comment on the meetings.

Yesterday, the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20General%20Assembly"&gt;General Assembly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's Third Commission passed resolution L29 against &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acapital%20punishment"&gt;capital punishment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ; the project was presented by &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Brazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;, and was defended vigorously by &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia%20national%20football%20%28soccer%29%20team"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; has defeated &lt;a href="w%3ANigeria%20national%20football%20%28soccer%29%20team"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt; 1-0 in a &lt;a href="w%3Afootball%20%28soccer%29"&gt;football (soccer)&lt;/a&gt; international &lt;a href="w%3AExhibition%20game"&gt;friendly&lt;/a&gt; yesterday (UTC). The match was played at &lt;a href="w%3ACraven%20Cottage"&gt;Craven Cottage&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;, home of &lt;a href="w%3AFulham%20Football%20Club"&gt;Fulham Football Club&lt;/a&gt;, for logistical reasons as a majority of the players are based in &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;.

The only goal of the match was scored by &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Carney"&gt;David Carney&lt;/a&gt; in the 52nd minute, playing in left midfield for the Socceroos. He scored the goal from around 30 metres out, curling the ball away from the Nigerian goalkeeper &lt;a href="w%3ADele%20Aiyenuga"&gt;Dele Aiyenuga&lt;/a&gt; and into the left hand side of the net.

Carney currently plays for &lt;a href="w%3ASheffield%20United"&gt;Sheffield United&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AFootball%20League%20Championship"&gt;Football League Championship&lt;/a&gt;. He previously played for &lt;a href="w%3ASydney%20FC"&gt;Sydney FC&lt;/a&gt; in the Australian &lt;a href="w%3AA-League"&gt;A-League&lt;/a&gt; competition, but transferred to Sheffield United earlier this year.

Both teams had chances throughout the match, mainly in the first half. Nigerian goalkeeper Aiyenuga saved four shots on target in the first half, from &lt;a href="w%3AHarry%20Kewell"&gt;Harry Kewell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANick%20Carle"&gt;Nick Carle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABrett%20Emerton"&gt;Brett Emerton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AScott%20McDonald"&gt;Scott McDonald&lt;/a&gt;.

Nigeria's best chance of the game was also in the first half. &lt;a href="w%3AAyo%20Makinwa"&gt;Ayo Makinwa&lt;/a&gt;'s shot from ten metres out deflected off a defender, wrong-footing Australian goalkeeper &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Schwarzer"&gt;Mark Schwarzer&lt;/a&gt;. However, Schwarzer managed to scramble and adjust his body positioning to parry the ball with one hand onto the crossbar and away from danger. Schwarzer also saved a shot on goal by &lt;a href="w%3AOsaze%20Odemwingie"&gt;Osaze Odemwingie&lt;/a&gt;, diving down to his left.

The match served as a warm-up for the Australian team before their campaign to qualify for the &lt;a href="w%3A2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup"&gt;2010 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;. This will be the first time the Australian national team has attempted to qualify for the World Cup through the &lt;a href="w%3AAsian%20Football%20Confederation"&gt;Asian Football Confederation&lt;/a&gt;, having moved from the &lt;a href="w%3AOceania%20Football%20Confederation"&gt;Oceania Football Confederation&lt;/a&gt; at the start of 2006 after qualifying for the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup"&gt;2006 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AJokela%20High%20School"&gt;Jokela High School&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ATuusula"&gt;Tuusula&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Finland"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt;, scene of the &lt;a href="w%3AJokela%20school%20shooting"&gt;Jokela school shooting&lt;/a&gt;, has recommenced classes. Earlier this month, student Pekka-Eric Auvinen, 18, fatally wounded eight people with his handgun before turning the weapon on himself in the country's worst ever school shooting. He died later in hospital, having never regained consciousness.

All last week repair teams have been working to eradicate all traces of the event, with large numbers of bullet holes in walls and doors being filled in, broken windows and torn blinds being replaced, and total renovation of one corridor which Auvinen had attempted to set fire to.

Students had previously been permitted into the school last week, in order to collect belongings left behind as they rushed to evacuate the school. On Monday, the school's 450 pupils began to attend temporary facilities set up at nearby Tuusula Primary School as well as the local church. 

Tuusula spokeswoman Heidi Hagman told reporters yesterday that at first school days would be considerably shortened, adding "Today the students will spend time getting used to the renovated and repaired school area. 

"Students and teachers are getting support from &lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Cross"&gt;Red Cross&lt;/a&gt; crisis workers and psychologists during the first days of school." 

Esa Ukkola, head of education in Tuusula, spoke to reporters about the fact that students had been shown around the renovated school. "We need to show there is nobody lurking in the cupboards any more. We're trying to have as normal a school day as possible. There are dozens of extra people to ensure we can do everything in small enough groups."

The shooting has prompted public anger in Finland at the media attention directed to it, with a feeling that it undermines the placid reputation of the country. People have questioned the decision of a survey last month to designate Finland as the world's "most livable country". Psycho-social service manager Anna Cantell-Forsbom from nearby &lt;a href="w%3AVantaa"&gt;Vantaa&lt;/a&gt; has spoken out about her view that the shooting was mainly caused by a lack of psychiatric care available to the Finnish youth and therefore did not reflect on Finnish society. The shooting has also prompted a move by the &lt;a href="w%3APolitics%20of%20Finland"&gt;Finnish government&lt;/a&gt; to raise the legal age for gun ownership from 15 years to 18 years.

Finland is expected to set up a commission of inquiry this week to investigate the murders. The government will set aside resources for the ministry of social affairs, health and education as well as the local municipality for the investigation. Meanwhile, local authorities have shown a four-year response plan to the government, asking for five million &lt;a href="w%3AEuro"&gt;Euro&lt;/a&gt; to fund it. Half will go towards therapy and occupational guidance for affected residents, while the other half would go to school guidance counsellors, psychologists, school healthcare personnel and other experts. The ultimate goal of the plan is the complete recovery of those adversely affected by the shooting.

<h1>Two airliners come within seconds of collision over Indiana, US</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Two%20airliners%20come%20within%20seconds%20of%20collision%20over%20Indiana%2C%20US&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A midair collision has been narrowly averted between two commercial airliners over &lt;a href="w%3AIndiana"&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href="w%3AMidwest%20Airlines"&gt;Midwest Airlines&lt;/a&gt; plane carrying 24 people and a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Express"&gt;United Express&lt;/a&gt; aircraft carrying 31 people came within 600 vertical feet and 1.3 horizontal miles apart.

The eastbound Midwest Airlines jet was accidentally directed to descend into the direct path of the westbound United Express flight. The mistake was made after an air traffic controller erroneously removed the latter aircraft's identification aircraft tag in preparation to handing off the aircraft to the air traffic control centre for a neighbouring sector of airspace.

The &lt;a href="w%3ATraffic%20Collision%20Avoidance%20System"&gt;Traffic Collision Avoidance System&lt;/a&gt; (TCAS) installed in the cockpits of both aircraft sounded emergency warnings advising the pilots to take evasive action. The Midwest Airlines plane promptly pulled up out of danger. Had TCAS not activated, it is believed the jets would have struck each other. "If they didn't suddenly climb, there would have been a convergence," said Midwest spokeswoman Carol Skornicka.

Had the aircraft struck each other, they would have been traveling at a combined speed of about 700 m.p.h. Airspeed would normally be higher, but congestion around &lt;a href="w%3AO%27Hare%20International%20Airport"&gt;O'Hare International Airport&lt;/a&gt; had slowed things down. The incident occurred at the end of a rush period, during a change in shift at the control centre.

Jeffrey Richards, president of the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Air%20Traffic%20Controllers%20Association"&gt;National Air Traffic Controllers Association&lt;/a&gt;, told reporters that pilots had mentioned three times in the course of the flight how close aircraft were coming, quoting them as saying to air traffic control on one occasion "Center, you really lined us up on that last clearance."

Near air misses are classified on a scale of D to A by the &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Aviation%20Authority"&gt;Federal Aviation Authority&lt;/a&gt;, A being the most serious. The incident was classed as a B, the third incident of such severity in just six weeks caused by mistakes at Chicago Centre. The minimum permitted distance for aircraft traveling at an altitude of 25,000 feet, as these two were, is five horizontal miles and 1,000 vertical feet.

Richards said that on the night of the incident controllers at Chicago Centre had been working close to the two hour working limit between rest breaks. "These controllers are fatigued from working such long stints and very few breaks compared to just three years ago," said Richards, who added that this was particularly true of the 26-year-old veteran who made the mistake. "Each of his sessions were right up to the two-hour limit," Richards said, adding that he was nearing the end of his shift and had returned from a break just minutes before the near-collision.

Richards said that at the time the building contained a staff of 11 controllers, five trainees and one supervisor, which is one supervisor and one controller lower than usual. He went on to say that before a retirement wave, 17 controllers monitored the airspace. He says this is a part of a larger issue whereby retirements are exhausting the supply of skilled operators, in what he describes as "a systemic problem,".

This latest incident raises important safety issues at Chicago Centre, which is currently undergoing a dispute between the controllers union and management over how many controllers are adequate to run the centre. The site is soon to have to handle large quantities of traffic as an annual holiday season starts. However, the FAA says that it currently has no issues with staffing at the facility, although Richards contends that low levels of staff and increasing workloads have long been a worrying factor at the facility.

Skornicka said of the incident that it was "part of a bigger debate taking place," and that she felt "this is just one situation that highlights the need for modernization and overhaul of the air traffic control system."

In the quarter-final of &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Baseball%20World%20Cup"&gt;2007 Baseball World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, because actual strengths of those finalists were merely close, the pitching became a key role to decide a team who entered or eliminated the semi-final.
<h2>&lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; vs &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;</h2>
With the closing by Japanese pitchers Tadashi Settsu &amp; Kohhei Hasebe, and great batting performance by Hisayoshi Chono with his solo HR in the top of 3rd inning and a 1-RBI-hit in the top of 7th inning, who ever hit a game-winning 3-run HR to beat &lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt; at 2006 Asian Games, Japan closed Australia with 3-0 winning.
<h2>&lt;a href="Mexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; vs &lt;a href="Cuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;</h2>
It's a pitching game before the 4th inning. After the bottom of 5th inning, with Mexico's starting pitcher Hector Rodriguez was in a unsteady condition, Cuba scored 3 RBIs with a great full base chance. And Yoandry Urgelles hit a 2-run HR in the bottom of 8th inning to tie Cuba's winning with 6-0.
<h2>South Korea vs &lt;a href="USA"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt;</h2>
Athletes from &lt;a href="w%3AMinor%20League"&gt;Minor League&lt;/a&gt; played a key role and made good performances at this game. USA beat Korea with 3-1 by Jeff Karstens' great starting pitching and Andy LaRoche's 2-run HR at the bottom of 1st inning from Korea's starting pitcher Won-jun Chang, the losing pitcher at this game.
<h2>&lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; vs &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Chinese Taipei&lt;/a&gt;</h2>
Media from Taiwan focused on this game because this fixture was also taken place past 6 years at the Quarter Final of &lt;a href="w%3A2001%20Baseball%20World%20Cup"&gt;2001 Baseball World Cup&lt;/a&gt;. Even though the host team (Chinese Taipei) want to challenge the champion, but Netherlands has ambitions to revenge the lost in 2001.

After Vince Rooi hit a solo HR to tie the score with 2-2 at the top of the 9th inning, the Batting of Netherlands was encouraged and started in the 10th inning, with the relief pitcher Fu-de Ni was in unstable, Netherlands scored 4 RBIs. Finally, Netherlands successfully revenged to the host team with 6-2 winning.

In the semi-final of &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Baseball%20World%20Cup"&gt;2007 Baseball World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, except for &lt;a href="Cuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt; vs &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="USA"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt; battled &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; this series after the host team (&lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Chinese Taipei&lt;/a&gt;) was eliminated by Netherlands.
<h2>Cuba vs Japan</h2>
The starting pitcher Aroldis Chapman had a excellence performance in his 8-innings pitching. He had a great chance to become the winning pitcher with effective offenses in the top of 4th and 9th innings by his teammates. Even though Toshiyuki Hayashi was hit by a pitch from Champan in the bottom of 7th inning, and Pedro Luis Lazo almostly broke a save, Cuba luckily won Japan by Cuba's final closer Yuniesky Maya with 5-3.
<h2>Netherlands vs USA</h2>
In this key game, 2A and 3A &lt;a href="w%3AMinor%20League"&gt;Minor League&lt;/a&gt; players from USA played a great role. Colby Rasmus from 2A hit a lead-off home run in the bottom of the 1st inning. His teammates also made an effective offense to score 4 RBIs by a full base chance in the bottom of the 8th inning. Finally, USA beat the Netherlands 5-0. They will take on Cuba 8 times in the Final of 2007 Baseball World Cup.

The &lt;a href="Poland"&gt;Polish&lt;/a&gt; national football team won 2:0 against &lt;a href="Belgium"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASilesian%20Stadium"&gt;Silesian Stadium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChorz%C3%B3w"&gt;Chorzów&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Prior to 2007 &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20101"&gt;Taipei 101&lt;/a&gt; Run Up, organizers held a 35-floors warming up match for local athletes from &lt;a href="w%3A2009%20Summer%20Deaflympics"&gt;2009 Summer Deaflympics&lt;/a&gt; with the theme of "Value Your Every Step". This warming up simulated every possible situation as athletes wore the RFID chip and some professional medical teams stood by for emergency.

"Taipei City and 2009 Summer &lt;a href="w%3ADeaflympics"&gt;Deaflympics&lt;/a&gt; (in the future) will be known with a conjunction from this game (Taipei 101 Run Up) and the promotion of 2009 Summer Deaflympics." Emile Sheng (Chief Executive Director of 2009 Summer Deaflympics) remarked before this match, "We (Taipei City Government, the organizer of 2009 Deaflympics) will provide the best service for athletes from participated nations to do an effective promotion of the deaf culture in Taiwan."

"The deaf culture in Taiwan was rarely respected by common people. After Taipei City was elected to be the organizer of the 2009 Deaflympics, and a success of '2007 &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Deaf%20Swimming%20Championship"&gt;World Deaf Swimming Championship&lt;/a&gt;', this (deaf) culture is now progressively respected around the world. I hope this game can be a great platform to make this known by more and more people with deaf athletes' participation." Sue Wang (Spokeswoman of 2007 Taipei Run Up and Sign Language Anchor of Public Television Service) remarked.

Hsiao-hua Tseng and Lan-feng Chen, men's and women's fastest athlete in this (warming up) match, finished separately with 6 min 9 secs and 6 min 45 secs. After this match, the host (Taipei 101) awarded certifications and announced that the main match will take place next Sunday (November 25) morning.

In statements to the press on November 14, the president of &lt;a href="Brazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALuiz%20In%C3%A1cio%20Lula%20da%20Silva"&gt;Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva&lt;/a&gt;, defended the President of &lt;a href="Venezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHugo%20Ch%C3%A1vez"&gt;Hugo Chávez&lt;/a&gt;, and minimized the incident between him and the &lt;a href="w%3ASpanish%20monarchy"&gt;King of Spain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJuan%20Carlos%20I%20of%20Spain"&gt;Juan Carlos I&lt;/a&gt; during the 17th &lt;a href="w%3AIbero-American%20Summit"&gt;Ibero-American Summit&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Chile"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt;.

According to &lt;a href="w%3AAg%C3%AAncia%20Brasil"&gt;Brazil Agency&lt;/a&gt;, Lula said after meeting with the president of the Guiné-Bissau: "There is little difference in opinion between King Juan Carlos and Chavez. There are many other differences between heads of State. Divergence is part of a democratic meeting."

The Brazilian President stressed that "Venezuela is a democratic country" and compared it with the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;: "You can criticize Chavez for anything but lack of democracy in Venezuela. In Venezuela, there were three referendums, three elections, four plebiscites... Why did nobody lament when Margaret Thatcher remained in power for so many years? It's continuity, there is nothing different. Only the system is slightly different, the system of presidential regime to ♡❤parlamentaristaan♡❤. But what matters is not the system, but the exercise of power. "

Drag—dressing in the clothing atypical of your born gender—in recent years has found mainstream success. Films such as ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Adventures%20of%20Priscilla%2C%20Queen%20of%20the%20Desert"&gt;Priscilla, Queen of the Desert&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMidnight%20in%20the%20Garden%20of%20Good%20and%20Evil%20%28film%29"&gt;Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ATo%20Wong%20Foo%2C%20Thanks%20for%20Everything%21%20Julie%20Newmar"&gt;To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ have prominently featured drag performers. But they have all focused on men in drag as women.

&lt;a href="w%3AMurray%20Hill%20%28performer%29"&gt;Murray Hill&lt;/a&gt; is a comedian, emcee and performer. He is also a &lt;a href="w%3ADrag%20king"&gt;drag king&lt;/a&gt;. Called "The Hardest Working Middle-aged Man in Show Business", ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20New%20York%20Times"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ christened him "the current reigning patriarch of the downtown performance community." He is seemingly everywhere, emceeing a bingo night at the now closed, &lt;a href="w%3AJimmy%20Fallon"&gt;Jimmy Fallon&lt;/a&gt;-backed Mo Pitkins' House of Satisfaction on &lt;a href="w%3AAvenue%20A"&gt;Avenue A&lt;/a&gt;, or hosting the &lt;a href="w%3APolyamorous"&gt;Polyamorous&lt;/a&gt; Pride Day in &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Park"&gt;Central Park&lt;/a&gt;. Hill has become a legend in New York's "anything goes" counterculture theater scene who is beginning to find mainstream success; which would be a first for a drag king. 

's examination of &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;'s culture has brought him to the whip's end of a , on the phone with &lt;a href="RuPaul%20speaks%20about%20society%20and%20the%20state%20of%20drag%20as%20performance%20art"&gt;RuPaul&lt;/a&gt;, matching wits with &lt;a href="An%20interview%20with%20gossip%20columnist%20Michael%20Musto%20on%20the%20art%20of%20celebrity%20journalism"&gt;Michael Musto&lt;/a&gt;, grilling &lt;a href="Gay%20Talese%20on%20the%20state%20of%20journalism%2C%20Iraq%20and%20his%20life"&gt;Gay Talese&lt;/a&gt;, eating dinner with &lt;a href="Augusten%20Burroughs%20on%20addiction%2C%20writing%2C%20his%20family%20and%20his%20new%20book"&gt;Augusten Burroughs&lt;/a&gt; and quizzing the bands that play the &lt;a href="Music"&gt;Bowery Ballroom&lt;/a&gt;.

♡❤♡DS: Do you consider yourself &lt;a href="w%3Atransgendered"&gt;transgendered&lt;/a&gt;?
♡❤♡DS: Do you consider yourself butch?

♡❤♡DS: What about in terms of &lt;a href="w%3AGender%20roles"&gt;gender roles&lt;/a&gt;, how you use gender? Are there boundaries for a drag king when they are performing in terms of what they should or shouldn’t do?

♡❤♡DS: When was that?
♡❤♡DS: Where did it go?
♡❤♡DS: Is there not an audience for it anymore?
♡❤♡DS: Why wouldn’t they cultivate a scene? Everybody is still here.
♡❤♡DS: Manhattan was always so central, do you think Brooklyn can fulfill that role or is the central-ness gone?

Chávez made this statement in the act of opening the third Summit of Chiefs of State of the &lt;a href="w%3AOrganization%20of%20Petroleum%20Exporting%20Countries"&gt;Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries&lt;/a&gt; (OPEC).

Mr. Chávez pleaded that OPEC should adopt a more political agenda and requested "that the
threats against the countries" of the organization should stop. He said that $100 dollars per barrel was a "fair" price and remembered that when he assumed presidency of Venezuela in 1999, the price went up to about ten dollars.

The prices of raw oil approached $100 last week before settling down again. Some observers think it is possible that the $100 barrier may be broken. During the trading session following this two-day summit, that is expected to result in the "Declaration of Riyadh", the price of petroleum rose $0.80 in the &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; market and $0.66 in &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>News briefs:November 19, 2007</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
This is the Audio Wikinews Brief, weekend review for November 19, 2007

<h2>Two students in Germany accused of plotting a school attack</h2>

Two students from Cologne, Germany, ages 17 and 18, are accused of allegedly plotting an attack at their school on November 20, the first anniversary of the shooting at Geschwister Scholl in Emsdetten, in which 18-year old ex-student Sebastian Bosse carried an attack that left six people wounded by gunshot and others wounded by detonated smoke bombs before taking his own life.

One of the suspects, age 17, killed himself on Friday during a confrontation with a high school teacher and a police officer. The plot was uncovered when a school principal had discovered a Web page the 17-year old suspect had created, showcasing material that glorified the two perpetrators of the Columbine High School massacre.
<h2>Ukrainian coal mine explodes, killing 68</h2>
An explosion in a coal mine has killed at least 68 people in the city of Donetsk, Ukraine, while 37 people are reported missing.

According to reports transmitted by the local press and the Emergency Situations Department, 360 miners managed to get to the surface safely; 28 others are currently hospitalized, some with severe burns.

The Zasyadko mine is nearly 1,000 meters deep, and 456 people were in the mine when the explosion occurred at 3:11 am.

The cause of the explosion is still unknown. Initial reports suggest that the explosion was caused by methane mixing with the air in the mine.

During the afternoon, more than thirty rescue teams were found at the scene, wearing hard hats and oxygen tanks as they prepared to enter the mine.

<h2>Lula: Venezuela "does not lack democracy"</h2>

In statements to the press on November 14, the president of Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, defended the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, and minimized the incident between him and the King of Spain, Juan Carlos I during the 17th Ibero-American Summit in Chile.

<h2>Dutch Justice Department bans Wikipedia for employees following vandalism</h2>

A spokesperson for the Justice Department in the Netherlands has confirmed to the Dutch magazine Intermediair that it will temporarily suspend access to Wikipedia for its 30,000 employees, following recently revealed vandalism by staff members.

The magazine has confronted the department with some untasteful edits which originated from their IP addresses. Anonymous users are registered through these unique internet fingerprints when they edit Wikipedia. The magazine exposed the vandalism through Wikiscanner.nl, a website which combines a database of Wikipedia alterations with a server database from large institutions. The site can be used to reveal which organisations are behind anonymous Wikipedia editors.

The controversial edits included topics such as the murder of controversial filmmaker Theo van Gogh, Jesus Christ, pop stars, witchcraft, and Donald Duck. Because of legal limitations on the time internet activity can be stored, it will probably not be possible to find out who exactly committed the vandalism, a spokesperson said.

<h2>UN's Third Commission passes resolution condemning capital punishment</h2>

On Friday, the United Nations General Assembly's Third Commission passed resolution L29 against capital punishment; the project was presented by New Zealand and Brazil, and was defended vigorously by Italy. With 99 votes in favor, 52 against and 33 abstentions, the necessary majority was met, needed in order to pass the resolution.

A mobile phone &lt;a href="w%3Aringtone"&gt;ringtone&lt;/a&gt; remix of the quote text has been downloaded 500,000 times (generating some &lt;a href="w%3AEuro"&gt;€&lt;/a&gt;1.5 million revenues). The ringtone features a voice actor (avoiding legal issues) with beats and a loop effect emphasising the 'shut up'. A student group from the Venezuelan capital of &lt;a href="w%3ACaracas"&gt;Caracas&lt;/a&gt; which opposes the President has downloaded the ringtone too. "It's a form of protest, it's something that a lot of people would like to tell the president. Now, whenever we call each other, that's what we hear," said Laura Solorzano, 21, in a telephone interview with the &lt;a href="w%3AMiami%20Herald"&gt;Miami Herald&lt;/a&gt;.

Today, the &lt;a href="internet"&gt;internet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Adomain%20name"&gt;domain name&lt;/a&gt; of the quote was sold on &lt;a href="w%3AeBay"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt; for €10,200 to a Spanish power seller called 'daikoku-design'. Juan Antonio Morales, 34, of &lt;a href="w%3AAlmer%C3%ADa"&gt;Almería&lt;/a&gt;, Spain, had reserved the domain shortly after news of the dispute broke. The video on &lt;a href="YouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; has been viewed over 1.3 million times, and there are numerous parodies using the quote. T-shirts and coffee mugs with the slogan are also selling well. The phrase has also become notable enough to merit &lt;a href="w%3A%C2%BFPor%20qu%C3%A9%20no%20te%20callas%3F"&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="Wikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;.

At the &lt;a href="w%3AIbero-American%20Summit"&gt;Ibero-American summit&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASantiago%2C%20Chile"&gt;Santiago&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Chile"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt; on November 10, Chávez called the Spain's former prime minister, &lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9%20Mar%C3%ADa%20Aznar"&gt;José María Aznar&lt;/a&gt;, a "fascist". Current Prime Minister of Spain &lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9%20Luis%20Rodr%C3%ADguez%20Zapatero"&gt;José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero&lt;/a&gt; tried to reply, but Chávez, although his microphone was switched off, kept interrupting him. The Spanish King first pointed a finger at Mr. Chávez, with the words "♡❤Y tu♡❤" (and you). Then, while Zapatero still tried to reply, he said “♡❤¿Por qué no te callas?♡❤” while making a gesture with his hand. Note that the King used the informal 'te callas' instead of the formal and polite third-person form. Zapatero finally replied that "...in a forum where there are democratic governments ... one of the essential principles is respect. You can disagree radically, without being disrespectful." '

The rare outburst of the King has led to some disturbance in political relations between the countries; Chávez demanded an apology from the King but said he did not want a political conflict with Spain, while Spanish diplomats hope the situation will soon normalise. The Spanish PM stressed the incident was magnified by of the media attention it received. In statements to the press, the president of Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, minimized the incident between Hugo Chávez and the King of Spain: "There is little difference in opinion between King Juan Carlos and Chavez. There are many other differences between heads of State. Divergence is part of a democratic meeting."

The situation brings attention to changes Chávez has proposed to the Venezuelan constitution, which would lift the restriction on the number of terms for the &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20Venezuela"&gt;President of Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABuenos%20Aires%2C%20Argentina"&gt;Buenos Aires, Argentina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
On Saturday the 17th of November, thousands of &lt;a href="w%3Alesbian"&gt;lesbian&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href="w%3Agay"&gt;gay&lt;/a&gt;s marched in the 16th &lt;a href="w%3AGay%20Pride%20Parade"&gt;Gay Pride Parade&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="Argentina"&gt;Argentine&lt;/a&gt; capital of &lt;a href="w%3ABuenos%20Aires"&gt;Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt;.

During the early hours of the evening, a crowd of people began to gather in the traditional and historical &lt;a href="w%3APlaza%20de%20Mayo"&gt;Plaza de Mayo&lt;/a&gt;, near of the &lt;a href="w%3ACasa%20Rosada"&gt;Casa Rosada&lt;/a&gt;, seat of the country's executive power. The police positioned operatives by the &lt;a href="w%3ABuenos%20Aires%20Metropolitan%20Cathedral"&gt;Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; to avoid clashes between &lt;a href="w%3ACatholic"&gt;Catholic&lt;/a&gt; groups and those protesting for gay and lesbian rights.

In statements made exclusively to ♡❤Wikinews♡❤, the chairwoman of the National Institute Against the Discrimination, Xenophobia and Racism (INADI) expressed that the march was of utmost importance.

"This is an advance for democracy, that we can gather so many people to celebrate diversity. We must work against all type of discrimination, and especially on this day against homophobia, and also pursue the rights not afforded us; for example, the identity of transsexual people," stated María José Lubertino, chairwoman of the INADI.

Lubertino stressed that INADI is trying to push for new legislation to be debated during 2008, and emphasized that during the course of this year, INADI has supported several couples' requests for &lt;a href="w%3Asame-sex%20marriage"&gt;same-sex marriage&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, INADI is also pushing for a debate in the National Congress to talk about civil union and marriage of &lt;a href="w%3ALGBT"&gt;gay, lesbian, transvestite and transsexual&lt;/a&gt; people.

Several minority groups attended the parade and crossed the &lt;a href="w%3AAvenida%20de%20Mayo"&gt;Avenida de Mayo&lt;/a&gt;, entering the blocks that separates the Plaza de Mayo and the &lt;a href="w%3AArgentine%20Chamber%20of%20Deputies"&gt;National Congress&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3ACondom"&gt;Condoms&lt;/a&gt; and information about &lt;a href="w%3AAIDS"&gt;AIDS&lt;/a&gt; were distributed during the parade.

Last night &lt;a href="w%3AHome%20Box%20Office"&gt;HBO&lt;/a&gt; premiered ♡❤I Am An Animal: The Story of Ingrid Newkirk and PETA♡❤. Since its inception, &lt;a href="w%3APeople%20for%20the%20Ethical%20Treatment%20of%20Animals"&gt;People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals&lt;/a&gt; (PETA) has made headlines and raised eyebrows. They are almost single-handedly responsible for the movement against &lt;a href="w%3AAnimal%20testing"&gt;animal testing&lt;/a&gt; and their efforts have raised the suffering animals experience in a broad spectrum of consumer goods production and food processing into a ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACause%20c%C3%A9l%C3%A8bre"&gt;cause célèbre&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. 

PETA first made headlines in the &lt;a href="w%3ASilver%20Spring%20monkeys"&gt;Silver Spring monkeys case&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href="w%3AAlex%20Pacheco"&gt;Alex Pacheco&lt;/a&gt;, then a student at &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Washington%20University"&gt;George Washington University&lt;/a&gt;, volunteered at a lab run by Edward Taub, who was testing &lt;a href="w%3ANeuroplasticity"&gt;neuroplasticity&lt;/a&gt; on live monkeys. Taub had cut sensory &lt;a href="w%3AGanglia"&gt;ganglia&lt;/a&gt; that supplied nerves to the monkeys' fingers, hands, arms, legs; with some of the monkeys, he had severed the entire spinal column. He then tried to force the monkeys to use their limbs by exposing them to persistent electric shock, prolonged physical restraint of an intact arm or leg, and by withholding food. With footage obtained by Pacheco, Taub was convicted of six counts of animal cruelty—largely as a result of the monkeys' reported living conditions—making them "the most famous lab animals in history," according to psychiatrist &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Brain%20That%20Changes%20Itself"&gt;Norman Doidge&lt;/a&gt;. Taub's conviction was later overturned on appeal and the monkeys were eventually &lt;a href="w%3AEuthanasia"&gt;euthanized&lt;/a&gt;.

PETA was born.

In the subsequent decades they ran the &lt;a href="w%3AStop%20Huntingdon%20Animal%20Cruelty"&gt;Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty&lt;/a&gt; against Europe's largest animal-testing facility (footage showed staff punching &lt;a href="w%3ABeagle"&gt;beagle&lt;/a&gt; puppies in the face, shouting at them, and simulating sex 
acts while taking blood samples); against &lt;a href="w%3ACovance"&gt;Covance&lt;/a&gt;, the United State's largest importer of primates for laboratory research (evidence was found that they were dissecting monkeys at its &lt;a href="w%3AVienna%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Vienna, Virginia&lt;/a&gt; laboratory while the animals were still alive); against &lt;a href="w%3AGeneral%20Motors"&gt;General Motors&lt;/a&gt; for using live animals in crash tests; against &lt;a href="w%3AL%27Oreal"&gt;L'Oreal&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="w%3ATesting%20cosmetics%20on%20animals"&gt;testing cosmetics on animals&lt;/a&gt;; against &lt;a href="w%3AFur_clothing%23Anti-fur_campaigns"&gt;the use of fur for fashion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AFur%20farming"&gt;fur farms&lt;/a&gt;; against &lt;a href="w%3ASmithfield%20Foods"&gt;Smithfield Foods&lt;/a&gt; for torturing &lt;a href="w%3AButterball"&gt;Butterball turkeys&lt;/a&gt;; and against fast food chains, most recently against &lt;a href="w%3AKFC"&gt;KFC&lt;/a&gt; through the launch of their website &lt;a href="w%3AKentuckyFriedCruelty.com"&gt;kentuckyfriedcruelty.com&lt;/a&gt;.

They have launched campaigns and engaged in stunts that are designed for media attention. In 1996, PETA activists famously threw a dead raccoon onto the table of &lt;a href="w%3AAnna%20Wintour"&gt;Anna Wintour&lt;/a&gt;, the fur supporting editor-in-chief of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AVogue%20%28magazine%29"&gt;Vogue&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, while she was dining at the &lt;a href="w%3AFour%20Seasons"&gt;Four Seasons&lt;/a&gt; in New York, and left bloody paw prints and the words "Fur Hag" on the steps of her home. They ran a campaign entitled &lt;a href="w%3AAnimal%20rights%20and%20the%20Holocaust"&gt;Holocaust on your Plate&lt;/a&gt; that consisted of eight 60-square-foot panels, each juxtaposing images of the Holocaust with images of factory farming. Photographs of concentration camp inmates in wooden bunks were shown next to photographs of caged chickens, and piled bodies of Holocaust victims next to a pile of pig carcasses. In 2003 in &lt;a href="w%3AJerusalem"&gt;Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt;, after &lt;a href="w%3AExploding%20donkey"&gt;a donkey was loaded with explosives and blown up&lt;/a&gt; in a terrorist attack, Newkirk sent a letter to then-&lt;a href="w%3APalestine%20Liberation%20Organization"&gt;PLO&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href="w%3AYasser%20Arafat"&gt;Yasser Arafat&lt;/a&gt; to keep animals out of the conflict. As the film shows, they also took over &lt;a href="w%3AJean-Paul%20Gaultier"&gt;Jean-Paul Gaultier&lt;/a&gt;'s Paris boutique and smeared blood on the windows to protest his use of fur in his clothing.

The group's tactics have been criticized. Co-founder Pacheco, who is no longer with PETA, called them "stupid human tricks." Some feminists criticize their campaigns featuring the &lt;a href="w%3ALettuce%20ladies"&gt;Lettuce Ladies&lt;/a&gt; and "I'd Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur" ads as objectifying women. Of their Holocaust on a Plate campaign, &lt;a href="w%3AAnti-Defamation%20League"&gt;Anti-Defamation League&lt;/a&gt; Chairman &lt;a href="w%3AAbraham%20Foxman"&gt;Abraham Foxman&lt;/a&gt; said "The effort by PETA to compare the deliberate systematic murder of millions of Jews to the issue of animal rights is abhorrent." (Newkirk later issued an apology for any hurt it caused). Perhaps most controversial amongst politicians, the public and even other animal rights organizations is PETA's refusal to condemn the actions of the &lt;a href="w%3AAnimal%20Liberation%20Front"&gt;Animal Liberation Front&lt;/a&gt;, which in January 2005 was named as a terrorist threat by the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Homeland%20Security"&gt;United States Department of Homeland Security&lt;/a&gt;. 

<h2>The HBO film about her life</h2>
♡❤♡David Shankbone: How did you feel about the film?

♡❤♡DS: You are pretty media savvy; was that okay with you that they crafted the film the way they did?
♡❤♡DS: Many people when they hear about PETA think they are an organization that is more concerned with the well-being of chickens than they are with the well-being of humans. How would you respond to that?
♡❤♡DS: Jim Young, one of the lab people with the really red ears—
♡❤♡DS: Everyone was looking at them. One of the things he had said was that you want to completely disassociate animals with humans.
♡❤♡DS: &lt;a href="w%3ADouglas%20Adams"&gt;Douglas Adams&lt;/a&gt;’ &lt;a href="w%3AHitchhiker%E2%80%99s%20Guide%20to%20the%20Galaxy"&gt;Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy&lt;/a&gt;?

<h2>PETA, animal rights groups and the Animal Liberation Front</h2>

♡❤♡DS: How do you feel when you hear other animal rights organizations coming out against PETA?
♡❤♡DS: What is something you have been asked to condemn?

♡❤♡DS: By the &lt;a href="w%3AAnimal%20Liberation%20Front"&gt;Animal Liberation Front&lt;/a&gt;?
♡❤♡DS: So you are okay with ALF activities? Some of that was covered in the film.
♡❤♡DS: &lt;a href="w%3AL%E2%80%99Oreal"&gt;L’Oreal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMaybelline"&gt;Maybelline&lt;/a&gt;—
♡❤♡DS: How do you feel about the ALF?
♡❤♡DS: Is arson a lesser of two evils proposition for you, then?

<h2>Newkirk on humans and other animals</h2>
♡❤♡DS: A critic would say that there is no equating humans with animals. That by stopping research that saves lives based upon these animals you are valuing chickens or mice over people.

♡❤♡DS: Like the &lt;a href="w%3ASaccharine"&gt;saccharine&lt;/a&gt; experiments, which were ridiculous because they showed it causes cancer in mice when you inject them with eight times their body weight daily with saccharine. We aren’t mice, and who consumes such amounts?
♡❤♡DS: Do you think blocking stem cell research is something that harms animals?
♡❤♡DS: In your book ♡❤Making Kind Choices♡❤ you have a chapter on bees. Have you been following the recent development on the ‘&lt;a href="w%3AColony%20Collapse%20Disorder"&gt;Rapture of the Bees&lt;/a&gt;?’ 
♡❤♡DS: What do you think is happening with the bees?
♡❤♡DS: That’s the thing: they can’t find any bee bodies. Millions and millions have disappeared.
♡❤♡DS: In your book she calls them ‘honeystealers’

<h2>Religion and animals</h2>
♡❤♡DS: &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Bible"&gt;The Bible&lt;/a&gt; talks about humans as custodians of the Earth, and the religious community is beginning to awaken to the notion that this means they need to be involved on environmental issues. What is the religious community’s relationship to animal welfare?

♡❤♡DS: &lt;a href="Sam%20Brownback%20on%20running%20for%20President%2C%20gay%20rights%2C%20the%20Middle%20East%20and%20religion"&gt;Sam Brownback raised that exact same quote&lt;/a&gt; in my interview with him, that God cares even when the smallest sparrow falls—
♡❤♡DS: In the movie they show PETA making a change in tactics from focusing on exotic animals to focusing on livestock such as turkeys. Exotic animals are things most people could support, but livestock is more out there for many. How would you respond to the argument that progress is incremental and by taking a leap from focusing on exotics to focusing on livestock you could be overreaching? 
♡❤♡DS: A religious argument might be that they were put on Earth ♡❤for♡❤ Man.

<h2>Fashion and animals</h2>
♡❤♡DS: Did your protest at &lt;a href="w%3AJean-Paul%20Gaultier"&gt;Jean-Paul Gaultier&lt;/a&gt; have any effect?
♡❤♡DS: You had mentioned earlier wool clothing in relation to Australian exporters. Are you against wool clothing or against how it is made and harvested?

<h2>Newkirk on the worst corporate animal abusers</h2>

♡❤♡DS: When you think of companies—obviously &lt;a href="w%3AButterball"&gt;Butterball&lt;/a&gt; would be one—
♡❤♡DS: Who are some of the most egregious abusers of animals?
♡❤♡DS: “Oh God, here comes Ingrid Newkirk with her soy chickens again!”
♡❤♡DS: What is Controlled Atmosphere Killing?

<h2>Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act</h2>
♡❤♡DS: Tell me how the &lt;a href="w%3AAnimal%20Enterprise%20Terrorism%20Act"&gt;Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act&lt;/a&gt; impedes you, and what you are doing to defeat the Act.
♡❤♡DS: Would you do a target investigation in a state where they have that act passed just to test its Constitutionality? 

<h2>Ingrid Newkirk on Ingrid Newkirk</h2>

♡❤♡DS: Did you and &lt;a href="w%3AAlex%20Pacheco"&gt;Alex Pacheco&lt;/a&gt; have a falling out?
♡❤♡DS: Like a family—
♡❤♡DS: Are you still in contact with him?
♡❤♡DS: Is he looking at becoming involved again?
♡❤♡DS: How would Ingrid Newkirk twenty years ago look at Ingrid Newkirk now?
♡❤♡DS: Just twenty years ago, the person you were then looking at the person you are now.

♡❤♡DS: Do you think you’ve achieved a lot of the things you had wanted back then?
♡❤♡DS: Do you think other people would say that?
♡❤♡DS: Do you have any regrets?
♡❤♡DS: Or personally.
♡❤♡DS: Just in general—in your life.
♡❤♡DS: See. Sometimes terrible questions birth wonderful answers.
♡❤♡DS: The nature of this interview is on a permanent encyclopedia—
♡❤♡DS: --so the questions are designed not just around your work, but also around who you are as a person.
♡❤♡DS: I didn’t see you as sad in that movie.
♡❤♡DS: It’s interesting you brought that up, because a thought I had watching the film is that people always find something to criticize with a person. It’s not, “Okay, Ingrid just really loves animals and wants to help them” but “you’re obsessed and sad.” If you were taking a $1,000,000 salary every year and driving around in a Mercedes, they would say, “She’s not really in it for the animals, she’s completely stuffing her pockets with her cause.” But you are not doing that [Newkirk earned $32,000 from PETA in 2005] and the film makes that clear; so instead, the criticism is that you are sad and obsessed. 
♡❤♡DS: You’re either milking it for all it is worth—
♡❤♡DS: What do you think drives people to jump at negative spin?
♡❤♡DS: Where do you draw your strength from? What’s behind that question is when I was in law school I did a Chihuahua rescue and helped to save perhaps 15 to 20 dogs. I thought it would be a great fulfilling thing, and it would be easy to do to host these animals while I read my law books. Instead, it was grueling. It ended up tearing me apart—
♡❤♡DS: --watching your film I thought, “I would be a terrible investigator. I would be like the guy in the movie who simply couldn’t do it.” I saw a 14-pound dog that was raped by a man and her insides were torn up; I had a dog who almost died on me because it had been so severely starved and beaten, and the only thing I could do to get it to survive was to take a syringe full of blended dog food liquidated with heavy cream and feed it while it bit my fingers. It took its toll on me and it was one of the things that made me very down on humanity—
♡❤♡DS: But it was hurtful.
♡❤♡DS: Where do you draw your strength to continue on and to not hate humanity?
♡❤♡DS: Animals don’t scheme.
♡❤♡DS: You do have a great memory.
♡❤♡DS: Yes, I do know.

The labor strikes in &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, which began on November 13, 2007, are continuing as hundreds of thousands of civil servants hold a 24-hour work stoppage. The action by postal workers, teachers, air traffic controllers and hospital staff, have left many schools closed and airports facing delays and flight cancellations.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANovember%202007%20strikes%20in%20France"&gt;November 2007 strikes in France&lt;/a&gt; began when &lt;a href="w%3ASNCF"&gt;SNCF&lt;/a&gt; rail workers and &lt;a href="w%3AParis%20M%C3%A9tro"&gt;Paris Métro&lt;/a&gt; engineers went on strike to protest reforms by &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20France"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Nicolas%20Sarkozy"&gt;Nicolas Sarkozy&lt;/a&gt;, which would reduce early retirement pensions.

Under current regulations, civil servants in France may retire after 37.5 years of service. Some professions, primarily in the rail industry, have an accelerated schedule, allowing rail workers to retire as early as age 50 with full benefits. The government wants to change that saying that these special pensions apply to 1.6 million workers and amount to 6% of the governments total pension payments.
The rail strike has, according to opinion polls, become quite unpopular. Speaking today, Sarkozy said "I am thinking about those millions of French people who after a day's work do not have a bus, a metro or a train to get home and who are tired of being held hostage. I am thinking of those companies that risk having to lay off workers."

The French finance minister &lt;a href="w%3AChristine%20Lagarde"&gt;Christine Lagarde&lt;/a&gt; estimated the strikes cost the economy of France &lt;a href="w%3AEuro"&gt;€&lt;/a&gt;350 million each day. "It's a real worry for the French economy," she said. Public accounts minister &lt;a href="w%3A%C3%89ric%20W%C5%93rth"&gt;Éric Wœrth&lt;/a&gt; spoke on &lt;a href="w%3AFrance%20Inter"&gt;France Inter&lt;/a&gt; radio and agreed that a prolonged strike would hurt the economy. "Not over several days. But if it lasted longer, it could obviously have consequences," he said.

The civil servants that began their 24-hour stoppage today are protesting what they say has been a de facto pay-cut. The purchasing power of their wages has dropped by 6% since 2000. They are demanding pay-raises and are protesting proposed job-cuts for 2008. The government has proposed to cut some 23,000 jobs, half of which would be in education.

The third work stoppage by French energy workers started last night, reducing electrical output by 9%. Newspaper distributors also went on strike, in protest of proposed restructuring. Students protested other reforms that would give universities greater autonomy. The students blocked access to buildings at campuses across the country.

&lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Michigan"&gt;University of Michigan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMichigan%20Wolverines%20football"&gt;Wolverines&lt;/a&gt; head coach &lt;a href="w%3ALloyd%20Carr"&gt;Lloyd Carr&lt;/a&gt;, who had coached the &lt;a href="w%3Acollege%20football"&gt;college football&lt;/a&gt; program for thirteen years, announced his retirement from the coaching profession, effective after the Wolverines' &lt;a href="w%3Abowl%20game"&gt;bowl game&lt;/a&gt;.

"Yesterday was one of the most emotional days of my life," Carr said at his press conference, referring to when he informed his team of his retirement. "I’ve cried more tears than I knew I had. I’ve never laughed so hard in my life. There’s so many memories. It was a wonderful day."

During his tenure at Michigan, Carr won five &lt;a href="w%3ABig%20Ten%20Conference"&gt;Big Ten Conference&lt;/a&gt; championships and a &lt;a href="w%3ANCAA%20Division%20I-A%20national%20football%20championship"&gt;national championship&lt;/a&gt; in 1997. He had a disappointing 1-6 record vs. &lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Tressel"&gt;Jim Tressel's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AOhio%20State%20Buckeyes"&gt;Ohio State Buckeyes&lt;/a&gt;, though his overall record vs. Ohio State was 6-7. Carr's last victory over Ohio State came in 2003. He amassed a 121-40 overall record while at Michigan and ranks seventh among active coaches with a 75.2 winning percentage.

There has been a lot of speculation, even before Carr's retirement, regarding who would become the next Michigan head coach. Current &lt;a href="w%3ALouisiana%20State%20University"&gt;Louisiana State University&lt;/a&gt; head coach &lt;a href="w%3ALes%20Miles"&gt;Les Miles&lt;/a&gt; is viewed as the top candidate to replace Carr.

Observers see Les Miles as the front-runner despite his recent comments. "I want to stay just where I’m at," Miles said. "I don’t want to think about it. Don’t want to envision it. I want to go forward and prepare."

At the &lt;a href="w%3A2001%20Baseball%20World%20Cup"&gt;2001 Baseball World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Cuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt; defended the &lt;a href="w%3ABaseball%20World%20Cup"&gt;Baseball World Cup&lt;/a&gt; championship, which they have dominated, by defeating &lt;a href="USA"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt;. This time, however, things turned out differently as USA ever defeated Cuba at the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.baseball.ch/PanAm/PA.htm"&gt;2006 Americas Olympics Baseball Qualifying Tournament&lt;/a&gt; with 8-5.

In the top of 2nd inning, with Cuba's starting pitcher &lt;a href="w%3AYadel%20Mart%C3%AD"&gt;Yadel Martí&lt;/a&gt; was unsteady. &lt;a href="w%3AJustin%20Ruggiano"&gt;Justin Ruggiano&lt;/a&gt; started the offense for USA with a hit. After &lt;a href="w%3ANorberto%20Gonz%C3%A1lez"&gt;Norberto González&lt;/a&gt; replaced Martí on the mound for Cuba, USA scored after loading the bases and kept the lead through the end of the game.

Even though Cuba scored 2 runs with successive hits in the bottom of 5th inning, the American pitchers from the &lt;a href="w%3AMinor%20league%20baseball"&gt;Minor Leagues&lt;/a&gt; effectively shut down Cuba's offense. USA eventually ended Cuba's reign as champion with a final score of 6-3. The Americans were crowned the 2007 Baseball World Cup champions, a title they last held way back in 1974. Coincidentially, Cuba did not participate in the BWC in 1974.

Two &lt;a href="International%20Space%20Station"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt; astronauts completed a 7 hour and 16 minutes spacewalk this morning that saw the completion of the ISS's newest room, ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHarmony%20%28ISS%20module%29"&gt;Harmony&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤.

Commander &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APeggy%20Whitson"&gt;Peggy Whitson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and Flight Engineer &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Tani"&gt;Daniel Tani&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; began their spacewalk early Tuesday morning at 5:10 a.m. EST (10:10 UTC). This was the second phase of a three phase project to complete the connection of the Harmony module to the rest of the Space Station. Whitson, who is ISS's first female Commander, exclaimed "Yay, got it!" after finishing a particularly difficult section of the hand-intensive project. The goal of the 7+ hour &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AExtra-Vehicular%20Activity"&gt;EVA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was to complete the connection of the power and heating cables and the fluid lines between the space station and the Harmony laboratory which the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle"&gt;Space Shuttle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Discovery"&gt;Discovery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; delivered to the space station last month.

During the dangerous spacewalk, the spacewalkers removed the fluid lines (which carry ammonia in an 18½-foot (5.6 m), 300-pound (136 kg) tray) and removed the tray from its storage location on the space station, then lugged it over to Harmony and bolted it down. The tray, which was awkward to carry, required the astronauts to take turns carrying it over to Harmony being careful not to bang it around. A frightening moment occurred during the venting of the hook ups that saw frozen ammonia crystals floating out and bouncing off of Whitson. &lt;a href="NASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; Mission Control explained to her that it was nothing to worry about at the time and that &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Adecontamination"&gt;decontamination&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; procedures would take place later. These decon procedures include brushing off the toxic substance and letting the sun bake it off.

The station's three astronauts have been working continuously since the Space Shuttle Discovery departed on the 5 November 2007 to get the new lab attached. The next shuttle mission is scheduled to lift off on 6 December 2007 with a new laboratory that will dock to Harmony, but the shuttle cannot commence its mission until Harmony is completely attached. A third and final Harmony space walk is scheduled for Saturday 24 November 2007 to attach the final fluid tray and complete connections to the Harmony lab.

&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AChancellor%20of%20the%20Exchequer"&gt;Chancellor of the Exchequer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAlistair%20Darling"&gt;Alistair Darling&lt;/a&gt; announced to a shocked &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20House%20of%20Commons"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt; today that two password-protected — but not encrypted — &lt;a href="w%3ACD-ROM"&gt;computer disks&lt;/a&gt; containing the entire &lt;a href="w%3AChild%20benefit%23United%20Kingdom"&gt;Child Benefit&lt;/a&gt; database have been lost in transit between the offices of &lt;a href="w%3AHer%20Majesty%27s%20Revenue%20and%20Customs"&gt;Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs&lt;/a&gt; (HMRC) in &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20Tyne%20and%20Wear"&gt;Washington, Tyne &amp; Wear&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Audit%20Office%20%28United%20Kingdom%29"&gt;National Audit Office&lt;/a&gt; (NAO) in &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, in what has been described as "one of the world’s biggest ID protection failures".

The database contains details of all families in the UK who receive Child Benefit — all families with children up to 16 years of age, plus those with children up to 20 years old if they are in full-time education or training — estimated to contain 25 million individuals in 7.25 million families. Among other items of information, the database contains names, addresses, dates of birth, child benefit and &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Insurance"&gt;National Insurance&lt;/a&gt; numbers, and where appropriate, bank or building society account details.

The discs were created by a junior official at the HMRC in response to a request for information by the NAO, and were sent unregistered and unrecorded on 18 October using the courier company &lt;a href="w%3ATNT%20N.V."&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; — which operates the HMRC's internal mail system. When it was found that the discs had not arrived for audit at the NAO, a further copy of this data was made and sent — this time by registered mail — and this package did arrive. HMRC were not informed that the original discs had been lost until 8 November, and Darling himself was informed on 10 November.

The violation of &lt;a href="w%3AData%20Protection%20Act%201998"&gt;data protection&lt;/a&gt; laws involved in the creation of the discs has led to strong attacks on the government's competence to establish the proposed National Identity Register, when all UK residents will have an &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20national%20identity%20card"&gt;identity card&lt;/a&gt;. Conservative Shadow Chancellor &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Osborne"&gt;George Osborne&lt;/a&gt; described the loss of data as "catastrophic" and said "They [the government] simply cannot be trusted with people's personal information".

The Chairman of HMRC, &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Gray%20%28civil%20servant%29"&gt;Paul Gray&lt;/a&gt;, has resigned over the affair, and critics are calling for Darling to do likewise.

This is the third data embarrassment for HMRC in recent weeks — earlier this month it was reported that the details of over 15,000 &lt;a href="w%3AStandard%20Life"&gt;Standard Life&lt;/a&gt; customers had been put on disk, and then lost en route from HMRC in Newcastle to Standard Life in Edinburgh — and last month a laptop containing the data of 400 people with high-value &lt;a href="w%3AIndividual%20Savings%20Account"&gt;ISAs&lt;/a&gt; was stolen from the boot of a car belonging to a HMRC official who had been carrying out a routine audit.

A tree known as the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAnne%20Frank%20Tree"&gt;Anne Frank Tree&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, a 150 year-old &lt;a href="w%3Achestnut%20tree"&gt;chestnut tree&lt;/a&gt; that was made famous in the writings of &lt;a href="w%3AAnne%20Frank"&gt;Anne Frank&lt;/a&gt;'s diary, has been saved from being chopped down by a Dutch court. 

Frank was a &lt;a href="w%3AJews"&gt;Jewish&lt;/a&gt; girl who was hiding from the &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; occupation of the &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20War%20II"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; and often referred to the tree as being "comforting" as she looked out the hidden apartment skylight.

Officials for the city of &lt;a href="w%3AAmsterdam"&gt;Amsterdam&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AAnne%20Frank%20Museum"&gt;Anne Frank Museum&lt;/a&gt; state that the tree is infected with a &lt;a href="w%3Afungus"&gt;fungus&lt;/a&gt; and poses a public health hazard as they argue that it was in imminent danger of falling over. It had been scheduled to be cut down on Tuesday, but was saved after an emergency court ruling.

Judge Jurjen Bade said the tree did not pose an "acute danger" and ruled out what he called "extreme measures," such as cutting it down immediately because conservationists claimed that it could be saved, and the city did not consider other alternatives to cutting it down.

According to the city the tree would have been replaced with an offspring of the original tree.

"We would rather have a young living tree that will be ten meters tall in ten years," said the director of the museum, Hans Westra.

People have even begun to sell the tree's chestnuts on auction websites like &lt;a href="w%3AeBay"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt; where one of the nuts reportedly reached a bid of &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;10,000.

&lt;a href="w%3ALiberation%20Tigers%20of%20Tamil%20Eelam"&gt;Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)&lt;/a&gt; rebels bombed an &lt;a href="w%3ASri%20Lanka"&gt;Sri Lankan&lt;/a&gt; air force base in &lt;a href="w%3AKatunayake"&gt;Katunayake&lt;/a&gt; in their first ever aerial attack on government forces.

At least two aircraft attacked the base on Monday at 00:45 hours local time. As many as 3 members of the air force were killed, and 17 injured during the attack when at least 2 bombs were dropped on the base. There are no reports of any air force jets being damaged or destroyed.

"The situation was brought under total control. The government vehemently condemns the cowardly attempt to attack the Katunayake air force camp in the aftermath of the major defeats suffered by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in the north and east," said a statement by the Media Center for National Security.

No casualties or damage have been reported from the neighbouring &lt;a href="w%3ABandaranaike%20International%20Airport"&gt;Bandaranaike International Airport&lt;/a&gt;, which is Sri Lanka's only international airport.

"No security threat prevailed to the commercial flights and passengers," added the statement.

Rebels released a statement following the attack warning of more bombings.

"It is a measure to protect Tamil civilians from the genocidal aerial bombardments by Sri Lankan armed forces. More attacks of the same nature will follow," said Rasiah Ilanthiraiyan, a spokesman for the rebel group. 

In 2001, a ground attack by the LTTE on Bandaranaike International Airport left nearly half of national carrier &lt;a href="w%3ASriLankan%20Airlines"&gt;SriLankan Airlines&lt;/a&gt;' fleet destroyed.

The Chief Constable of &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Yorkshire%20Police"&gt;South Yorkshire Police&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMeredydd%20Hughes"&gt;Meredydd Hughes&lt;/a&gt;, was found guilty of speeding at Wrexham Magistrates Court today and banned from driving. He was caught driving at 90 mph where the speed limit was 60 mph. Wrexham Magistrates court disqualified Hughes from driving for 42 days and fined him £350.

The Chief Constable did not appear in court in person, but was represented by his solicitor, Huw Edwards. Mr Edwards said:

"He doesn't seek to make any excuse about this matter. He totally accepts that the police have a duty to do. He is no exception and he accepts that he must be punished for the offence."

"He asks me to apologise for the offence. He recognises that the matter is a serious matter." 

Hughes had already received six penalty points on his license from previous speeding convictions and a conviction for failing to identify the speeding driver of one of his force's vehicles in 2006, although his driving licence was free of points at the time he went to court. Wrexham Magistrates Court had adjourned the case to today from a date in late November, as Meredydd Hughes initially claimed that he has still not yet found a solicitor to represent him.

Matthew Elliot, the Chief Executive of the &lt;a href="w%3ATaxPayers%27%20Alliance"&gt;TaxPayers' Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, criticized Hughes for wasting Court time at the taxpayer's expense. "Meredydd Hughes has shown breathtaking hypocrisy in this case," said Elliot. "Not only has he been caught preaching one thing and doing another in the past, but he has also wasted court time and therefore taxpayers’ money."

Jools Townsend, speaking for the Road Safety Campaign group Brake, said the offence was "Shocking" and the sentence "lenient" - and that the Chief Constable should "Seriously consider his position as a result".

The incident is embarrassing for South Yorkshire Police, as Hughes was the Chair of ACPO's road policing enforcement committee, with responsibility for developing police policies about how speed cameras are used. Hughes is a supporter of mobile speed cameras and believes that all speed cameras should be deliberately hidden from motorists, and has given interviews on the importance of road safety management in businesses.

As "Brand International Promotion Association" and "Taiwan Excellent &lt;a href="w%3AManufacturer"&gt;Manufacturer&lt;/a&gt;s' Association" merged to "&lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; Excellent Brand Association" (TEBA), "2007 Taiwan Brands' Trend Forum", with the slogan of "Winning Global Economic with Taiwan Brands", held yesterday and invited professionals from &lt;a href="w%3Agovernment"&gt;government&lt;/a&gt;al, &lt;a href="Economy%20and%20business"&gt;financial&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AComputing"&gt;IT&lt;/a&gt; industries to share experiences on marketing MIT (Made in Taiwan) brands and encourage MIT brands market to the world by innovations.

Newly-elected Chairman of TEBA Andy Tzu-jen Hsieh remarked in the opening: "A product with MIT brand didn't mean 'cheap' but 'value' of its good quality." With Hsieh's words, Minister of Economic Affairs of Taiwan Steve Ruey-long Chen echoed and said: "Self-made (MIT) brands were progressively refined with its innovations, R&amp;D, and new ideas. Lots of good MIT brands became notable world-wide in the presence. But it's uncertain to determine success or failure when a company manages its brand because companies with small-business scale were grown up. A brand needs a long-period management to keep it in a good image."

Many participants and local media focused on the keynote speech by the founder of &lt;a href="w%3AMultitech"&gt;Multitech&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AStan%20Shih"&gt;Stan Shih&lt;/a&gt;. He compared brands trend between Taiwan and other world-wide countries with ♡❤"&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20World%20Is%20Flat"&gt;The World Is Flat&lt;/a&gt;"♡❤ and proved the trend of optimization on global companies with his "&lt;a href="w%3ASmiling%20Curve"&gt;Smiling Curve&lt;/a&gt;" theory. "We (the public) should determine a brand good or failure by its quality, nature, and notability but not its scale." Shih said and stressed, "Companies with MIT brands (&lt;a href="w%3AOBM"&gt;OBMs&lt;/a&gt;) can't always be &lt;a href="w%3AODM"&gt;ODMs&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3AOEM"&gt;OEMs&lt;/a&gt; because some (people) often confused on conceptions and basis of 'Branding Taiwan' and 'Taiwan Brands'. If a company need a good brand, it (a brand) should has its (brand owner's) creations and management strategies to mark it into the world in a good position."

"The brand trends in Taiwan is from ODM in the past to OEM commonly in the presence. But after some products by MIT companies were presented to the public, lots of MIT brands became world-class brands such as &lt;a href="w%3ABenQ"&gt;BenQ&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGiant%20Manufacturing"&gt;Giant&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAcer%20%28company%29"&gt;Acer&lt;/a&gt; so that Taiwan can enter into the OBMs' era. If Taiwan can still be in the OBMs' era, the global market competitiveness and world-wide media exposure of MIT brands will be improved. 'OBMs in Taiwan' will help companies from several industries keep their headquarters retain in Taiwan." Tracy Chun-fang Hsu (Vice Director-general of the Bureau of Foreign Trade, Ministry of Economic Affairs of R.O.C.) mentioned in the forum.

Before the Panel Discussion, Jerry Wang (Vice Chairman of BenQ) corrected the difference between "&lt;a href="w%3AValue%20%28personal%20and%20cultural%29"&gt;Values&lt;/a&gt;" and "&lt;a href="w%3AValue%20%28economics%29"&gt;Value&lt;/a&gt;" with some quotes from &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;. He said: "Value of a brand include values and consumers' value. A factor who determine consumers to buy a product or not is emotion or self-need. A brand's or a product's nature can be known with differences on consumers' population. Of course, in Taiwan or other world-wide countries, every self-made brand or product has its style, nature, and characteristics."

In the final of Panel Discussion, 3 main speakers think that "&lt;a href="w%3ASmiling%20Curve"&gt;Smiling Curve&lt;/a&gt;" theory is a key factor to determine a company pursue its "brand value" success or failure. If a MIT brands wants to become world-class and notable, a company (brand owner) should not only have its creations, images, and innovations but also consider feelings from consumers.

&lt;a href="w%3AScott%20McClellan"&gt;Scott McClellan&lt;/a&gt;, a former &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House%20Press%20Secretary"&gt;White House Press Secretary&lt;/a&gt;, says in a new book that &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Dick%20Cheney"&gt;Dick Cheney&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Karl%20Rove"&gt;Karl Rove&lt;/a&gt;, misled McClellan about the , leading him to publicly exonerate Rove and &lt;a href="w%3ALewis%20Libby"&gt;Lewis "Scooter" Libby&lt;/a&gt;.

"There was one problem. It was not true. I had unknowingly passed along false information. And five of the highest ranking officials in the administration were involved in my doing so: Rove, Libby, the vice president, the president's chief of staff, and the president himself," says McClellan in a excerpt of the book that was released to the public.

In an interview with &lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;, earlier this year, McClellan said his statements were what he "believed to be true at the time based on assurances that we were both given." At that time he gave no indication that Bush was involved with or even knew that Rove or Libby were involved with the leak.

The current White House Press Secretary, &lt;a href="w%3ADana%20Perino"&gt;Dana Perino&lt;/a&gt;, said, when asked about it today, that it is not clear what McClellan means in the excerpt. "The President has not and would not ask his spokespeople to pass on false information," she said.

"Just when you think the credibility of this White House can't get any lower, another shoe drops," said Senator &lt;a href="w%3AChuck%20Schumer"&gt;Chuck Schumer&lt;/a&gt;, of &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;. "If the Bush administration won't even tell the truth to its official spokesman, how can the American people expect to be told the truth either?"

<h1>Sabotage strikes French railways</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Sabotage%20strikes%20French%20railways&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;'s state-owned railway operator, &lt;a href="w%3ASNCF"&gt;SNCF&lt;/a&gt;, said the four main &lt;a href="w%3ATGV"&gt;TGV&lt;/a&gt; lines serving &lt;a href="Paris"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; were sabotaged in what appeared to coordinated pre-dawn attacks. The acts of sabotage included a very large fire, said SNCF. TGV service faced extensive delays on Wednesday, which was exacerbated by the ongoing &lt;a href="w%3ANovember%202007%20strikes%20in%20France"&gt;November 2007 strikes in France&lt;/a&gt;. SNCF says that 23% of its workers remain on strike.

"These actions are the work of hardliners and show total irresponsibility," said the SNCF, blaming militant strikers. Several smaller fires were started by stuffing a burning rag into cable storage boxes, disrupting the rail signals and forcing authorities to reroute service. The large fire damaged some 30 &lt;a href="w%3Akilometre"&gt;km&lt;/a&gt; (18.6 &lt;a href="w%3AMile"&gt;miles&lt;/a&gt;) of cable along the TGV Atlantic line.

Union leaders immediately distanced themselves from the sabotage and said the acts were "committed by cowards." &lt;a href="w%3ABernard%20Thibault"&gt;Bernard Thibault&lt;/a&gt;, head of the &lt;a href="w%3AConf%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20g%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale%20du%20travail"&gt;Confédération générale du travail&lt;/a&gt; (CGT), said it was possible the acts were committed to discredit the unions.

According to Transport Minister &lt;a href="w%3ADominique%20Bussereau"&gt;Dominique Bussereau&lt;/a&gt;, who was speaking to &lt;a href="w%3AFrance%202"&gt;France 2&lt;/a&gt;, said that President &lt;a href="Nicolas%20Sarkozy"&gt;Nicolas Sarkozy&lt;/a&gt; ordered an investigation with the aim to punish the culprits "with the utmost severity." 

Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AFran%C3%A7ois%20Fillon"&gt;François Fillon&lt;/a&gt; said, "Those responsible for these acts of sabotage no doubt believed they could interrupt the negotiations and the return to work that is under way at the SNCF," in a speech to the &lt;a href="w%3AParliament%20of%20France"&gt;Parliament of France&lt;/a&gt;. "Well, I'm telling them they are very much mistaken," he continued.
Negotiations with the unions began at 3:00 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20European%20Time"&gt;CET&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC%2B1"&gt;UTC+1&lt;/a&gt;) on Wednesday. "There have been a number of advances, of announcements," said Didier Le Reste, who heads up CGT's rail division. "I trust railway workers to take decisions that are appropriate."

President Sarkozy said that while he will not back down on the issue of early retirements, he is willing to make other concessions to the unions. He also encouraged workers to return to work as negotiations have begun. "Everyone must ask whether it is right to continue a strike which has already cost users&amp;mdash;and strikers&amp;mdash;so dear," he said.

Meanwhile, teachers and other civil servants, who yesterday started a 24-hour work stoppage in their own protests against government reforms, returned to work. University students, however, continued disruptions in a protest against education reform. New today, was a street demonstration by tobacco shop owners, who are protesting a proposed smoking-ban in bars.

&lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; failed to qualify for &lt;a href="w%3AUEFA%20Euro%202008"&gt;UEFA Euro 2008&lt;/a&gt; after a 2-3 defeat to &lt;a href="Croatia"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3AWembley%20Stadium"&gt;Wembley Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;.

Needing to avoid defeat to secure qualification, England got off to a bad start as &lt;a href="w%3ANiko%20Kranj%C4%8Dar"&gt;Niko Kranjčar&lt;/a&gt;'s shot came off goalkeeper &lt;a href="w%3AScott%20Carson"&gt;Scott Carson&lt;/a&gt; to give Croatia the lead after just eight minutes. Soon afterwards &lt;a href="w%3AIvica%20Oli%C4%87"&gt;Ivica Olić&lt;/a&gt; doubled Croatia's lead.

England scored when &lt;a href="w%3AJosip%20%C5%A0imuni%C4%87"&gt;Josip Šimunić&lt;/a&gt; pulled back &lt;a href="w%3AJermaine%20Defoe"&gt;Jermaine Defoe&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href="w%3AFrank%20Lampard"&gt;Frank Lampard&lt;/a&gt; converting the resulting penalty. &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Beckham"&gt;David Beckham&lt;/a&gt;, winning his 99th cap for England, set up &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Crouch"&gt;Peter Crouch&lt;/a&gt; who equalised with a volley. However Croatia continued to push England back, and substitute &lt;a href="w%3AMladen%20Petri%C4%87"&gt;Mladen Petrić&lt;/a&gt; scored the winner from 25 metres with just under fifteen minutes remaining.

Croatia finished at the top in &lt;a href="w%3AUEFA%20Euro%202008%20qualifying%20Group%20E"&gt;Group E&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; also qualified after their 1-0 victory over . England finished third in the group, missing out on their first major tournament since the 1994 World Cup. Manager &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20McClaren"&gt;Steve McClaren&lt;/a&gt;'s job is in doubt, having been criticised during the qualification campaign and dropping regular goalkeeper &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Robinson"&gt;Paul Robinson&lt;/a&gt; in favour of newcomer Scott Carson for the vital final match.

A former accountant for &lt;a href="Oral%20Roberts%20University"&gt;Oral Roberts University&lt;/a&gt; (ORU) has filed a lawsuit against ORU and its Board of Regents claiming he was told by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Roberts%20%28evangelist%29"&gt;Richard Roberts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and his wife Lindsay to "&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acook%20the%20books"&gt;cook the books&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ", hiding financial wrongdoing from authorities and the public. Trent Huddleston, the accountant, has filed suit against the school and the Robertses claiming he "was improperly and unlawfully directed to perform functions and duties in violation of state and federal law in an effort by the defendants to 'cook the books' and hide from the appropriate authorities and the public the continued wrongdoing, improper and illegal conduct of the defendants, and in particular, of Richard and Lindsay Roberts."

Huddleston said that nearly $123,000 in remodeling fees for their home was paid by Oral Roberts University and Oral Roberts Ministries. In addition the lawsuit alleges $4,000 was spent on a pool table for the Robertses. Previously the Roberts were accused of illegal political and financial wrongdoing, which forced the president to step down from his positison.

Last week at a meeting called by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOral%20Roberts"&gt;Oral Roberts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , founder of the University and former &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Afaith%20healer"&gt;faith healer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a majority of the faculty voted against allowing Richard to serve as president. 

An ORU spokesman declined to comment on latest lawsuit and the faculty meeting.

In other news, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATulsa%20World"&gt;Tulsa World&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; released emails between Richard and his political adviser and sister-in-law, Stephanie Cantees. The emails given by an anonymous source, show the two plan to gain political influence using ORU students.

<h1>Australian Liberal Party criticised over fake pamphlets</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Australian%20Liberal%20Party%20criticised%20over%20fake%20pamphlets&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt; campaigners have been accused of a smear campaign against the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Labor Party&lt;/a&gt; after pamphlets were distributed in the federal electorate of &lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Lindsay"&gt;Lindsay&lt;/a&gt; that implied Labor supported Islamic terrorists. The pamphlets claimed to be from the non-existent "Islamic Australia Federation" and praised "Labors support to forgive our Muslim brothers who have been unjustly sentenced to death for the Bali bombings".

A "stake-out" by Labor party members revealed the distributors of the pamphlet to include Greg Chijoff, husband of Liberal candidate Kate Chijoff, and Gary Clark, husband of the Liberal Lindsay MP &lt;a href="w%3AJackie%20Kelly"&gt;Jackie Kelly&lt;/a&gt;, who will retire from her seat at the election. In an interview on ABC radio Kelly said she was "upset" at her husband, but tried to dismiss the pamphlet as a joke. "Pretty much everyone who's read it chuckles," she said. The incident was described as a "disgraceful act" by the Labor candidate for Lindsay, David Bradbury, and "deceitful" by Ikebal Patel, chairman of the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Federation%20of%20Islamic%20Councils"&gt;Australian Federation of Islamic Councils&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Electoral%20Commission"&gt;Australian Electoral Commission&lt;/a&gt; are investigating the distribution of the pamphlets, and have forwarded the Labor Party's complaint to the Federal Police. The Liberal party has expelled two members in connection with the matter.

In interviews with press and at his major speech to the National Press Club, Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; has condemned the makers of the pamphlet. "It's no part of my campaign and the party has acted promptly to deal with it," he said.

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; aircraft-carrier &lt;a href="w%3AUSS%20Kitty%20Hawk%20%28CV-63%29"&gt;USS Kitty Hawk CV-63&lt;/a&gt;, along with the other ships that comprise the carrier-group, were scheduled to make a port visit to &lt;a href="Hong%20Kong"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt; on the November 21 for the &lt;a href="w%3AThanksgiving"&gt;Thanksgiving&lt;/a&gt; holiday. However, &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; initially denied entry to Hong Kong. After some publicity, China reversed its position and allowed the Kitty Hawk to dock. 

According to the ♡❤Financial Times♡❤, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced a reversal of the decision on Thursday. The Ministry gave no explanation for the initial refusal but said that "We have decided to allow the Kitty Hawk strike group to stay in Hong Kong during Thanksgiving, and it is a decision out of humanitarian consideration only." 

The decision had led to some chaos, as American families had arrived in Hong Kong only to be informed that they would not be able to meet with their family members serving on the Kitty Hawk and then needed to again be informed when the decision was reversed.

The Kitty Hawk has been stationed in the &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Ocean"&gt;Pacific&lt;/a&gt; since the early 1960s and has visited Hong Kong multiple times.

&lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20McClaren"&gt;Steve McClaren&lt;/a&gt; and his deputy &lt;a href="w%3ATerry%20Venables"&gt;Terry Venables&lt;/a&gt; have both been sacked by the &lt;a href="England"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFootball%20Association"&gt;Football Association&lt;/a&gt; after a unanimous decision by board members during an emergency meeting held earlier today. 

The decision was announced by the FA chief executive &lt;a href="w%3ABrian%20Barwick"&gt;Brian Barwick&lt;/a&gt; in a press conference held this morning after widespread speculation due to the poor performance of the &lt;a href="w%3AEngland%20national%20football%20team"&gt;English national team&lt;/a&gt; which last night failed to qualify for the &lt;a href="w%3AUEFA%20Euro%202008"&gt;UEFA Euro 2008&lt;/a&gt; competition. The cost of removing him from his post is thought to cost &lt;a href="w%3APound%20sterling"&gt;£&lt;/a&gt;2.6 million.

According to a study by the Centre for Economic and Business Research, missing out on Euro 2008 could cost the British economy as much as £1 billion. 

The recruiting process has already started to find the next manager for the team, only 18 months after 46-year-old McClaren was given the role. During the press conference the FA admitted that not qualifying for the competition was "embarrassing".

On Thursday, &lt;a href="Colombia"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt; ended &lt;a href="Hugo%20Ch%C3%A1vez"&gt;Hugo Chávez&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20Venezuela"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;a href="Venezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;, efforts in negotiating hostage releases with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARevolutionary%20Armed%20Forces%20of%20Colombia"&gt;Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (FARC). &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A%C3%81lvaro%20Uribe"&gt;Álvaro Uribe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20Colombia"&gt;President of Colombia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , said that Chávez broke a November 10 agreement not to speak directly to Colombian military commanders.
FARC, reportedly, hold hundreds of hostages in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ajungle"&gt;jungles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of Colombia. Their aim in the mediation was to trade some 50 hostages for 500 of their own, held in prisons of Colombia. FARC is offering high-profile hostages such as former Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A%C3%8Dngrid%20Betancourt"&gt;Íngrid Betancourt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and three &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;Americans&lt;/a&gt; as leverage.

"The president of the republic considers as terminated the facilitation of the Senator Piedad Cordoba and the mediation of President Hugo Chávez and thanks them for their assistance," Uribe said in a statement. "Today Senator Piedad Cordoba telephoned the army commander, General Mario Montoya, asking for a meeting and then passed the telephone to President Chávez, who asked questions about the hostages held by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia," the statement continued.

Later, the Colombian government said it will only let Chávez meet with FARC again, if FARC releases some hostages and pledges to release the rest.

Íngrid Betancourt was kidnapped on February 23, 2002, while she was campaigning for the presidency of Colombia. She also holds &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; citizenship. When Chávez met &lt;a href="Nicolas%20Sarkozy"&gt;Nicolas Sarkozy&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20France"&gt;President of France&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on November 20, he was unable to provide proof that Betancourt was alive, but said that he had been told she was alive as recently as November 18.

On Thursday, Sarkozy urged Uribe to reconsider. "We continue to think that President Chávez is the best chance for freeing Íngrid Betancourt and all the other hostages," said Sarkozy spokesperson &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Afr%3ADavid%20Martinon"&gt;David Martinon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

On Tuesday, the press and members of the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Turkey%20Federation"&gt;National Turkey Federation&lt;/a&gt; gathered in large numbers at the &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House%20Rose%20Garden"&gt;Rose Garden&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; to witness an annual &lt;a href="w%3AThanksgiving"&gt;Thanksgiving&lt;/a&gt; tradition in the U.S., a &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Thanksgiving%20Turkey%20Presentation"&gt;presidential pardon of two Thanksgiving&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aturkey%20%28bird%29"&gt;turkeys&lt;/a&gt;.

Every year, a U.S. President gives a pardon to two turkeys, saving them from being put on a dinner table somewhere in America. This year, President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; pardoned two turkeys named ♡❤May♡❤ and ♡❤Flower♡❤, who were both chosen for the pardon by the citizens of the U.S.

"Each of you is taking part in a tradition that goes back to the days of Harry Truman. And to paraphrase Harry today, we have a message for our two feathered friends: You cannot take the heat -- and you're definitely going to stay out of the kitchen. I thank everybody who voted online to choose the names for our guests of honor. And I'm pleased to announce the winning names [May and Flower]. [These names are] certainly better than the names the &lt;a href="w%3ADick%20Cheney"&gt;vice president&lt;/a&gt; suggested, which was Lunch and Dinner," Bush said jokingly.

After receiving the pardons, the turkeys got a special ride in a three-car motorcade to &lt;a href="w%3ADulles%20Airport"&gt;Dulles Airport&lt;/a&gt;, which included an array of lights, sirens and police motorcycles. From there, both turkeys were flown to &lt;a href="Orlando"&gt;Orlando&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; on a plane dubbed ♡❤United Turkey One♡❤ where they were the Grand Marshalls for today's Thanksgiving Day parade in &lt;a href="Walt%20Disney%20World"&gt;Walt Disney World&lt;/a&gt;. Both turkeys received a welcome which included a red carpet, and free passes to the park.

"So now I have a task, and that is to grant a full presidential pardon to May and Flower. They'll be shortly flown to Disney World, where they will serve as Honorary Grand Marshals for the Thanksgiving Day Parade. I hope that honor doesn't go to their head. May they live the rest of their lives in blissful gobbling. And may all Americans enjoy a holiday full of love and peace. God bless you all," added Bush.

On November 17, 2007, at the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Troph%C3%A9e%20Eric%20Bompard"&gt;2007 Trophée Eric Bompard&lt;/a&gt; competition in &lt;a href="Paris"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; pair skaters &lt;a href="w%3ATiffany%20Vise"&gt;Tiffany Vise&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ADerek%20Trent"&gt;Derek Trent&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3APair%20skating%23Terminology"&gt;mirror pair team&lt;/a&gt;, became the first pair skaters in the world to land a throw quadruple &lt;a href="w%3ASalchow%20jump"&gt;salchow jump&lt;/a&gt;. The jump was ratified as clean by Technical Controller Ann Hardy-Thomas, and the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Skating%20Union"&gt;International Skating Union&lt;/a&gt; officially proclaimed it the first in international competition on Monday, November 19th.

This jump had been attempted many times in competition before, most notably by &lt;a href="w%3AZhang%20Dan"&gt;Zhang Dan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AZhang%20Hao"&gt;Zhang Hao&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Winter%20Olympics"&gt;2006 Winter Olympics&lt;/a&gt;. Vise &amp; Trent had tried it unsuccessfully before, as had &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AJessica%20Miller"&gt;Jessica Miller&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href="w%3AIan%20Moram"&gt;Ian Moram&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AYuko%20Kawaguchi"&gt;Yuko Kawaguchi&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Smirnov"&gt;Alexander Smirnov&lt;/a&gt;.

This is the first quadruple jump in pair skating. The first throw triple axel in international competition was performed by &lt;a href="w%3ARena%20Inoue"&gt;Rena Inoue&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Baldwin%20%28figure%20skater%29"&gt;John Baldwin&lt;/a&gt; at the 2006 Olympics.

A &lt;a href="w%3ABatavia%20Air"&gt;Batavia Air&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing"&gt;Boeing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20737"&gt;737-400&lt;/a&gt; has landed safely after a segment of wing up to two metres in size separated from the aircraft 15 minutes after takeoff on a domestic flight between &lt;a href="w%3AJakarta"&gt;Jakarta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APontianak%2C%20Indonesia"&gt;Pontianak&lt;/a&gt; late on Wednesday night.

Batavia spokesman Anton Situmeang commented that the aircraft, which was carrying 138 passengers and six crew, could have continued to its destination without the part, but had returned for an &lt;a href="w%3Aemergency%20landing"&gt;emergency landing&lt;/a&gt; as a precaution. He went on to say that the plane's last major service was only a month or two ago, and consequently Batavia have launched their own independent investigation.

Indonesia's National Transport Safety Committee senior investigator Frans Wenas told reporters that the missing part had been located close to the airport. News website Detik.com is quoted by the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Herarld%20Tribune"&gt;International Herarld Tribune&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ as saying that the piece struck a house, but there are no reports of injuries on the ground.

Deregulation of the Indonesian airline industry in the 1990s has resulted in the startup of many new budget carriers, including Batavia Air. However, industry analysists have raised concerns that deregulation has resulted in lax safety standards and poor industry supervision. Indonesia is now trying to address the concerns ahead of an EU review of the decision to add all Indonesian airlines to the &lt;a href="w%3Alist%20of%20air%20carriers%20banned%20in%20the%20EU"&gt;list of air carriers banned in the EU&lt;/a&gt;.

Police in &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; are currently investigating the "Bully Councillors"-scandal at the 2007 Baseball World Cup. City councillors are accused of showing up for a game with only one ticket, but demanding that two or more people be allowed entry. Several baseball fans in Taiwan protested to the Taichung City Government yesterday. A witness to this scandal, who recorded its process, was threatened by some councilors and hooligans in Taichung City. However, this might be a rumor because some facts are uncertain. A Taichung City Councilor Hsiao Chieh threatened Chinese Taipei Baseball Association (CTBA) with canceling the budget for the 2007 Asian Baseball Championship. In regards to the rumors of a threat that were mentioned above, internet users in Taiwan criticized Councilors with "not wanting to admit their mistakes" and "exhibiting very ugly behavior."

According to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Daily%20News"&gt;United Daily News&lt;/a&gt; in Taiwan, an internet user alleged that a councilor, who was involved in this scandal, claimed his behavior was in "service to the voters". CTBA and Taichung City Government announced to the media that "The scandal was just a misunderstanding" and that "those councillors and voters all had tickets, not bullies" extremely. 

Even though this scandal is still being investigated by the police, some fans and citizens are worried that public security organizations and the government will be negligent in their handling of this scandal. They fear the truth of the culprit will never be revealed. The public hopes Taichung City Government will take responsibility for this scandal as soon as possible.

&lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; cruise ship ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMS%20Explorer"&gt;MS Explorer&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ is sinking in &lt;a href="Antarctica"&gt;Antarctic&lt;/a&gt; waters, near the &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Shetland%20Islands"&gt;South Shetland Islands&lt;/a&gt;. Having struck an unknown underwater object and taking on water, all but the captain and chief officer of the 156 on board, have abandoned ship for life boats and await rescue. 

Despite having a strong reinforced ice breaking hull, the ship is said to be listing heavily and expected to sink soon. A cruise ship in the vicinity, the ♡❤Antarctic Dream♡❤, has been diverted to help but is not expected to arrive until at least 11.00 hours &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;. Four &lt;a href="Argentina"&gt;Argentine&lt;/a&gt; vessels were also dispatched but are not expected to arrive for some time.

The rescue effort is an international affair, being undertaken by the Argentine Coast Guard, with help from the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Coast%20Guard"&gt;U.S. Coast Guard&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ANorfolk%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Norfolk, Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="w%3AU.K.%20Coast%20Guard"&gt;U.K. Coast Guard&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AFalmouth"&gt;Falmouth&lt;/a&gt; in an advisory capacity.

All passengers and crew from the stricken &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; cruise ship ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMS%20Explorer"&gt;MS Explorer&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ are safe. Since broadcasting a call for help at approximately 05:24 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;, a number of vessels in the area have raced to rescue her 156 passengers and crew. Four vessels led by the cruise ship the ♡❤Endeavour♡❤ were the first to arrive and pick up the evacuees from lifeboats and &lt;a href="w%3ARigid-hulled%20inflatable%20boat"&gt;RIBs&lt;/a&gt;, later being transferred to the &lt;a href="Norway"&gt;Norwegian&lt;/a&gt; ship, ♡❤MS Nordnorge♡❤.

In less than one hour all passengers and crew, said to be cold but in good health, were safely transferred to the ♡❤Nordnorge♡❤, and that vessel is now heading towards &lt;a href="w%3AKing%20George%20Island"&gt;King George Island&lt;/a&gt;, three or four hours steaming away. Speaking on the BBC's &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20News%2024"&gt;News 24&lt;/a&gt;, the captain of the ♡❤Nordnorge♡❤ said that he was heading for the &lt;a href="Chile"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt;an research station, from where it is expected that all can be flown back to the &lt;a href="South%20America"&gt;South America&lt;/a&gt;n mainland.

Off the &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Shetland%20Islands"&gt;South Shetland Islands&lt;/a&gt; the ship struck an underwater object (believed to be a submerged iceberg ) the Explorer developed a fist sized crack and began taking on water. Initially said to be listing to starboard at 25° the &lt;a href="Argentina"&gt;Argentine&lt;/a&gt; Coast Guard reports that the list has since increased to 45° and the vessel is expected to sink soon. Concerns now turn to possible environmental concerns and damage. 

The rescue effort was an international affair involving the coast guards of &lt;a href="Argentina"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="USA"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt;, Chile and the &lt;a href="UK"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;. The UK's &lt;a href="w%3AMaritime%20and%20Coastguard%20Agency"&gt;Maritime and Coastguard Agency&lt;/a&gt; received notification from the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Coast%20Guard"&gt;US Coast Guard&lt;/a&gt; between 5.30-6.00 asking for the ♡❤Explorer♡❤♡s emergency data plans.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Records%2C%20competitiveness%20and%20creations%20centre-stage%20at%202007%20Soochow%20International%2024H%20Ultra-Marathon&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Founded in 1999, and the first-ever 24 hour ultra-marathon race in Taiwan, the 7th Soochow International 24H Ultra-Marathon, took place on November 24-25, 2007. Even though the race has been suspended in the past, in 2000 and 2006, due to poor conditions on the track field, several world-class runners participated in the 2007 race.
<h2>First-ever Hall of Fame to Ryoichi Sekiya</h2>

According to &lt;a href="w%3ASoochow%20University%20%28Taiwan%29"&gt;Soochow University&lt;/a&gt;, the host and organizer of the games, the juries judged this award from some conditions especially on results of past races world-wide and in Taiwan, including World Cup Ultra-Marathon.

On November 23, the juries declared Japanese runner Ryoichi Sekiya as the first runner in the Hall of Fame of the 2007 games as Sekiya currently holds the record for Asia's 24h ultra-marathon race, supervised by International Association of Ultrarunners.

<h2>A difficult 24-hours battle</h2>
As the host declared the game with a "final battle" of ultra-marathon to the world, the 24-hour and 12-hour classes started on November 24. Participants in those classes would fight until next morning (November 25), and they had to reverse their directions every four hours during the race.

But due to some unforeseen disturbances from &lt;a href="w%3A2007_Pacific_typhoon_season%23Typhoon_Mitag_%28Mina%29"&gt;Typhoon Mitag&lt;/a&gt;, the weather was uncertain from day to night. The uncertain conditions caused some runners to enter the medical station frequently.
<h2>Two Japanese break Asia's Record respectively</h2>
Runners from the Japanese Team showed their best strength and endurance during the long and difficult 24-hour race, as it sometimes rained and shined in Taipei City.

Finally, Ryoichi Sekiya ran 275.684 km to retain his championship, and his teammate Sumie Inagaki ran 232.92 km to win the Women's 24H Championship. They respectively broke Asia's 24hr ultra-marathon records in men's and women's classes in this race.

<h2>Local Volunteers show the quality of this race</h2>
According to some information at SCU Taiwan, the SCU recruited their students to volunteer as administrations of the race, including lap-counting (12hr and 24hr classes), medical service, competition controlling, and real-time multilingual translation as volunteers.

With their participation, they not only gained experience as administrators and organizers, but their teachers can also evaluate their service quality and inherit their leaderships for sports organizations in Taiwan when organizations want to hold an international competition in the future.

<h1>Kitty Hawk and other U.S. warships' visit to Hong Kong canceled</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Kitty%20Hawk%20and%20other%20U.S.%20warships%27%20visit%20to%20Hong%20Kong%20canceled&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; aircraft-carrier &lt;a href="w%3AUSS%20Kitty%20Hawk%20%28CV-63%29"&gt;USS Kitty Hawk CV-63&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of her carrier-group, were scheduled to make a port visit to &lt;a href="Hong%20Kong"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="w%3AThanksgiving"&gt;Thanksgiving&lt;/a&gt; holiday. Without warning &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; refused to allow the Kitty Hawk to dock, before reversing the decision without explanation. However, by that time bad weather and logistics forced the Kitty Hawk and its attendant ships to return to Japan. 

This left many families of sailors who had intended to spend the holiday in Hong Kong without their family members from the ships. The crews instead celebrated the holiday on board their ships. 

China has not explained why the carrier group was denied entry nor why the sudden reversal of the decision occurred. Admiral &lt;a href="w%3ATimothy%20J.%20Keating"&gt;Timothy Keating&lt;/a&gt;, the commander for the U.S. forces in the Pacific, said that he did not understand why China had made its decision and was "concerned". 

This is not the first time that China had denied entry to U.S. ships, but previous denials have occurred in response to tension or diplomatic disputes and there was no obvious motivation for the recent Chinese decision. Speculated reasons for the decision include possible responses to disagreements over &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;'s nuclear program and the recent United States decision to give a medal to the &lt;a href="Dalai%20Lama"&gt;Dalai Lama&lt;/a&gt;. 

This visit was to be the last visit of the Kitty Hawk to Hong Kong, as the Kitty Hawk is scheduled to be decommissioned when the new &lt;a href="w%3AUSS%20George%20Washington%20%28CVN-73%29"&gt;USS George Washington (CVN-73)&lt;/a&gt;, a modern nuclear powered carrier, comes align.

Free agent left-handed pitcher &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Kennedy%20%28baseball%29"&gt;Joe Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;, 28, died suddenly on Friday in &lt;a href="w%3ABrandon%2C%20Florida"&gt;Brandon, Florida&lt;/a&gt; where he was visiting his wife's family.

Kennedy was at an in-laws' home where he collapsed shortly after 1:15 a.m. He was taken to Brandon Regional Hospital where he was pronounced dead. No cause of death was yet formally determined, although some observers speculated he sustained an &lt;a href="w%3AAneurysm"&gt;aneurysm&lt;/a&gt; or heart failure.

Since leaving the &lt;a href="w%3AOakland%20Athletics"&gt;Oakland Athletics&lt;/a&gt;, Kennedy signed with the &lt;a href="w%3AArizona%20Diamondbacks"&gt;Arizona Diamondbacks&lt;/a&gt; briefly during August 2007 then being released the same month. Kennedy then joined the &lt;a href="w%3AToronto%20Blue%20Jays"&gt;Toronto Blue Jays&lt;/a&gt; late that month.

The 6-foot, 4-inch southpaw pitched at Grossmont Junior College in El Cajon, California before being drafted by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in the 8th round of the 1998 amateur draft. Kennedy pitched a total of 908.7 innings with a winning percentage of .413 and a 4.5 ERA for his career.

On Thursday, November 22, &lt;a href="w%3AThanksgiving"&gt;Thanksgiving Day&lt;/a&gt;, Bradley Priebe, a one-year-old baby boy fell from a third floor apartment window in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%2C%20New%20York"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;. He has now been allowed to leave the hospital after staying overnight for observation. According to reports, the child sustained no serious injures from the fall and is in stable condition. 

Anna Priebe, the baby's mother says that it is "a miracle" that her son did not break any bones. Brandon, the father, says that the boy is doing "good. Everything's OK."

Bradley crawled out of the window and fell onto the roof of a &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Bronx"&gt;Bronx&lt;/a&gt; music shop. The window was nearly 20 feet from the ground. The family thought the window was closed.

Police say that there is no reason to suspect that the incident is a criminal action, and no charges have been filed against the parents.

Early results in the &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20federal%20election%2C%202007"&gt;federal election&lt;/a&gt; held today show that the opposition &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Labor Party&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href="Kevin%20Rudd"&gt;Kevin Rudd&lt;/a&gt; looks set to take government. Such a result would end 11 years under the leadership of the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;National&lt;/a&gt; coalition led by &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt;.

Early results indicate a 5.25 percent swing to Labor, with 12 percent of the vote counted. If the pattern is continued through the night, Labor could end up with a ten seat majority in the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;Australian House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; allowing Mr Rudd to form government.

Mr Howard may also face an uphill battle to hold onto his &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; seat of &lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Bennelong"&gt;Bennelong&lt;/a&gt;, with Labor recruit &lt;a href="w%3AMaxine%20McKew"&gt;Maxine McKew&lt;/a&gt; 47.3 percent of the primary vote to Mr Howard's 42.7 percent.

<h2>Update 10:04 UTC</h2>

At 9:04 PM (&lt;a href="w%3ATime%20in%20Australia"&gt;AEDT&lt;/a&gt;), Labor leads the election with 68 seats, the coalition 43 with 37 still undecided.

Mr Howard also continues to fight for his seat of Bennelong, with the Labor candidate leading Mr Howard 45.95 to 45.19 on the primary vote.

<h2>Update 10:50 UTC</h2>
According to the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation"&gt;Australian Broadcasting Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, Labor will win the election. Labor's deputy leader &lt;a href="w%3AJulia%20Gillard"&gt;Julia Gillard&lt;/a&gt; has said Labor had all but won. 

"On the numbers we're seeing tonight, Labor is going to form a government," she said.

Officially, Labor has won 71 seats, the coalition 50 with 27 undecided. 63.84 percent of the vote has been counted. Labor has received a 5.89 percent swing against the incumbent coalition.

<h2>Update 12:20 UTC</h2>
The &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; reports that Howard has conceded the election.

Before the Legislative Elections and Presidential Election in Taiwan, conflicts between the Pan-Green and Pan-Blue Coalitions were more and more intensive. Some politicians participated in the trade fair at the &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20World%20Trade%20Center"&gt;Taipei World Trade Center&lt;/a&gt; earlier, and Annette Lu, vice-president of the Republic of China, and Chen Shui-bian, president of the Republic of China, were never booed by some citizens because of the hot topic of commodities prices. This time, the Taipei City Government has battled to the Executive Yuan with some opinion on the "Gate of Great Centrality and Perfect Uprightness" in the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall and the voting process of the Legislative Elections.

In fact, the conflicts on the naming issue from Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall to National Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall was never a hot topic because governments like Executive Yuan still supported the movement of "Removing Chiang-Kai-shek-related things". After the Ministry of Education planned to remove four Chinese Words in the "Gate of Great Centrality and Perfect Uprightness", the Taipei City Mayor Lung-pin Hau was angered over this. With those hot issues above, some Pan-Greens criticized that Hau equaled to the PRC.
Not only the issue of Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, but 18 divisions controlled by the KMT Mayors or Magistrates demonstrated that on the Central Election Commission on the voting process of the Legislative Elections. The Premier of ROC Chun-hsiung Chang stressed: "If any division violates our (meant to Executive Yuan) policy to hold the Legislative Elections, and "officials in those divisions won't get the retirement payment in the future!" This word caused conflicts between the two main Coalitions. With some rumors on the "Protest" and Chen Shui-bian was registered currently in Taipei City, Chen angered those opposes and directly said: "I would like to confiscate elections on those DAMN (meant to Pan-Blue) divisions."

As Hau replied, "Rather not giving any votes" to Chen, Chen replied to Hau again: "What a DAMN world? What a DAMN place? What a DAMN mayor? What's the hell? What a DAMN innocence? The public have rights to vote, why NOT to give votes? If Hau is DARE not giving votes, I'd like to obey the law and take the votes!" Those phenomenas will still effect the 2008 Taiwan Presidential Elections.

<h1>Naked News presents a new style of news</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Naked%20News%20presents%20a%20new%20style%20of%20news&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;a href="w%3ANaked%20News"&gt;Naked News&lt;/a&gt;' slogan reads “The Program With Nothing to Hide,” and everything holds true to that. The &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt;-based program presents the news completely bare, with little exception, including a segment they present outside naked. The exception being if they are in the process of disrobing, or if they are reporting a tragic news event. &lt;a href="Gabriel%20Pollard"&gt;Gabriel Pollard&lt;/a&gt;, writing for ♡❤Wikinews♡❤, interviewed &lt;a href="w%3AVictoria%20Sinclair"&gt;Victoria Sinclair&lt;/a&gt; about the “sensual, but not sexual” Naked News, and her presenting role.

The show had a fairly basic start, with two friends, Fernando Perreira and Kirby Stasnyk, bluntly thinking that the news would be better presented naked. Sinclair said, “In this case, these men had the means and the will to turn their idea into reality.” A Russian program with a similar concept, "600 seconds" on M1 TV, in which news anchor Svetlana Pesotskaya removed an article of clothing after each story, received high ratings within eight months of its introduction in 1999. Naked Broadcasting Network Inc. also started a male edition in 2001, but this was discontinued a few years later due to lack of interest from its key demographic, the gay community. It failed to get the same kind of grounding experienced by the female edition. Later imitators in &lt;a href="Hong%20Kong"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; have also proved successful.

In 1999&amp;mdash;its inception&amp;mdash;Naked News only had around 8,000 subscribers of a free five-minute show hosted on Daily Dirt. They now boast six million paid subscribers to a much longer news program of 22-minutes produced every six days from 172 countries worldwide. Lead Anchor and spokeswoman Victoria Sinclair puts the success of the international viewership due to the “captivating, saucy, and certainly different” way of presenting the news, “That certainly counts when the news is bad&amp;mdash;which it often is.” The public loves the format, and have become “quite attached” to the anchors, says 38-year-old Sinclair.

“I believe the secret to our success is that we challenged the accepted boundaries while keeping it clean and tasteful.

“I think the way has been paved for us by mainstream journalism; we would never have been embraced so eagerly by the world if it weren’t well prepared.”

Sinclair says the reason she got attracted to the Naked News program in the first place was because of its originality, and it felt “very adventurous and underground.” “I think we have a friendlier way of delivering the news...”

As well as the show being streamed onto the &lt;a href="Internet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt;, another version of the show called Naked News TV! is also available on pay-per-view in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;, Canada, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, etc. Naked News TV! is a weekly 50-minute show and marks Naked News' success at porting over from the Internet to television.

While Sinclair has been presenting Naked News since the pilot programme in May 1999 – production started in December 1999 – she can't see herself doing anything else, unless it is equally as “unusual”, involves technology, and the Internet. However, she did take a year sabbatical after 9/11. She left her previous job of marketing because it was no longer fulfilling. Sinclair plans to continue her anchoring role in Naked News, and holding a position of Public Relations, as the show expands into the new markets of &lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; until the time comes that she looks better non-nude.

Her “loving and supportive” family and friends are entirely supportive of her current profession. “They are all accustomed to me as it is through their influence that I have become such an independent freethinker.”

Former world chess champion &lt;a href="w%3AGarry%20Kasparov"&gt;Garry Kasparov&lt;/a&gt; has been arrested along with other opposition leaders after leading protests against current &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n president &lt;a href="Vladimir%20Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt;. Kasparov, a prominent critic of Putin, founded the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Civil%20Front"&gt;United Civil Front&lt;/a&gt; and named the &lt;a href="w%3AOther%20Russia"&gt;Other Russia&lt;/a&gt; umbrella of opposition parties after retiring from chess. 

The protest began peacefully, after a legal rally held by Kasparov and the other opposition leaders to protest what they see as unfair election practices including the barring of Other Russia candidates from running in the upcoming election. After the initial rally some of the demonstrators tried to march to the offices of the election commission.

Kasparov said that the government's response showed that the "the only language they can use with their own people is the language of violence, truncheons and riot police."

The ruling party &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Russia"&gt;United Russia&lt;/a&gt; has broad popular support and the state-controlled media have paid little attention to the opposition parties. 

Others arrested included Maria Gaidar, daughter of former prime minister &lt;a href="w%3AYegor%20Gaidar"&gt;Yegor Gaidar&lt;/a&gt; and human-rights activist &lt;a href="w%3ALev%20Ponomaryov"&gt;Lev Ponomaryov&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="Kevin%20Rudd"&gt;Kevin Rudd&lt;/a&gt; is set to become &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;'s 26th &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; after his &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Labor&lt;/a&gt; party defeated &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;National&lt;/a&gt; coalition on Saturday. Mr Howard was the Australian PM for 11 years.

Mr Rudd easily secured the 16 seats Labor needed to win in the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;, recording a nationwide swing of 6.3 percent.

The victory makes Labor's deputy leader &lt;a href="w%3AJulia%20Gillard"&gt;Julia Gillard&lt;/a&gt; Australia's first female &lt;a href="w%3ADeputy%20Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Deputy Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;.

Giving a concession speech in &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;, Mr Howard said he took full responsibility for his government's demise. "I accept full responsibility for the Liberal party campaign, and I therefore accept full responsibility for the Coalition's defeat in this election campaign," he said.

Mr Howard told party supporters that he wished for &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Costello"&gt;Peter Costello&lt;/a&gt;, the Howard government's treasurer to succeed him as leader of the Liberal party.

"The only other thing that I want to say is that the Liberal party of course will need to find a new leader, and I wish that person well, whoever that is, and I've indicated very clearly in my earlier remarks who I believe that person should be. I believe the future of our party does lie very much with Peter Costello and with others who will come in behind him."

Mr Howard congratulated Mr Rudd on his election win and reflected upon his government's past 11 and a half years. "This is a great democracy and I want to wish Mr Rudd well," Howard said.

"We bequeath to him a nation that is stronger and prouder and more prosperous than it was 11-1/2 years ago."

Mr Howard also conceded that it was "very likely" he would lose his own seat of &lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Bennelong"&gt;Bennelong&lt;/a&gt; to Labor candidate &lt;a href="w%3AMaxine%20McKew"&gt;Maxine McKew&lt;/a&gt;. Should Ms McKew win the seat, it will be the first time Bennelong has been held by Labor since its creation in 1949. It would also be only the second time in Australian political history that a Prime Minister has lost his own seat in parliament, the last Prime Minister to suffer such a fate was &lt;a href="w%3AStanley%20Bruce"&gt;Stanley Bruce&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian_federal_election%2C_1929"&gt;1929&lt;/a&gt;.

Shortly after Mr Howard's concession, Prime Minister-elect Kevin Rudd delivered a victory speech in &lt;a href="w%3ABrisbane"&gt;Brisbane&lt;/a&gt;. Mr Rudd promised to represent all Australians and thanked his predecessor John Howard for his contribution to Australia.

"Today Australia has looked to the future, will be a prime minister for all Australians," said Rudd.

"I want to acknowledge now for the entire Australian nation and publicly recognise Mr Howard's extensive contribution to public service in Australia."

The incoming Prime Minister also thanked Australia's allies and said he looked forward to working with them.

I look forward as the next Prime Minister of Australia to working with them in dealing with the great challenges, which our world faces.

"I extend our greetings tonight to our great friend and ally the United States, to our great friends and partners across Asia and the Pacific".

According to the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Oceanic%20and%20Atmospheric%20Administration"&gt;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&lt;/a&gt;'s (NOAA) &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Weather%20Service"&gt;National Weather Service&lt;/a&gt;, much of western &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; and southeastern &lt;a href="New%20Mexico"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt; is under a "winter storm warning."

"A winter storm will continue to bring widespread snowfall to much of west Texas and southeastern New Mexico through Sunday morning," said the NOAA in a special weather statement.

Parts of NM could see three to six inches of snow "with isolated areas receiving six to eight inches of snow," added the statement. Some parts of NM have already seen just over a foot of snow with &lt;a href="w%3ARed%20River%2C%20New%20Mexico"&gt;Red River&lt;/a&gt; picking up 13 inches. 

Western Texas could see three to six inches as well, with some areas picking up a little more. &lt;a href="w%3ASeminole%2C%20Texas"&gt;Seminole&lt;/a&gt; has reported only two inches of snow so far.

According to &lt;a href="w%3AAccuWeather"&gt;AccuWeather&lt;/a&gt;, the storm is expected to turn northeast and take a "track taking it west of the &lt;a href="w%3AAppalachian%20Mountains"&gt;Appalachians&lt;/a&gt; Sunday night and Monday."

Despite the hopes of many &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Wisconsin-Madison"&gt;University of Wisconsin-Madison&lt;/a&gt; (UW) students, &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Onion"&gt;♡❤The Onion♡❤&lt;/a&gt; was not named after their student center. "People always ask questions about where the name ♡❤The Onion♡❤ came from," said President Sean Mills in an interview with , "and when I recently asked Tim Keck, who was one of the founders, he told me the name—I’ve ♡❤never♡❤ heard this story about ‘see you at the un-yun’—he said it was literally that his Uncle said he should call it ♡❤The Onion♡❤ when he saw him and Chris Johnson eating an onion sandwich. They had literally just cut up the onion and put it on bread." According to Editorial Manager Chet Clem, their food budget was so low when they started the paper that they were down to white bread and onions.

Long before ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Daily%20Show"&gt;The Daily Show&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Colbert%20Report"&gt;The Colbert Report&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, Heck and Johnson envisioned a publication that would parody the news&amp;mdash;and news reporting&amp;mdash;when they were students at UW in 1988. Since its inception, ♡❤The Onion♡❤ has become a veritable news parody empire, with a print edition, a website that drew 5,000,000 unique visitors in the month of October, personal ads, a 24 hour news network, podcasts, and a recently launched world atlas called ♡❤Our Dumb World♡❤. &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Gore"&gt;Al Gore&lt;/a&gt; and General &lt;a href="w%3ATommy%20Franks"&gt;Tommy Franks&lt;/a&gt; casually rattle off their favorite headlines (Gore's was when ♡❤The Onion♡❤ reported he and &lt;a href="w%3ATipper%20Gore"&gt;Tipper&lt;/a&gt; were having the best sex of their lives after his 2000 &lt;a href="w%3AElectoral%20college"&gt;Electoral College&lt;/a&gt; defeat). Many of their writers have gone on to wield great influence on &lt;a href="w%3AJon%20Stewart"&gt;Jon Stewart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Colbert"&gt;Stephen Colbert&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ANews%20parody"&gt;news parody&lt;/a&gt; shows. 

And we are sorry to break the news to all you amateur headline writers: your submissions do not even get read.

Below is David Shankbone's interview with Chet Clem and Sean Mills about the news empire that has become ♡❤The Onion♡❤. 

<h2>How The Onion writes an issue</h2>
♡❤♡David Shankbone How do you decide on the stories?
♡❤♡DS: So you don’t have writers coming up with a story and headline, but you will instead have a team of writers choosing the best headlines and then assign it to a particular writer who was not necessarily involved?

<h2>The headlines</h2>

♡❤♡DS: It seems like some publications, like ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAM%20New%20York"&gt;AM New York&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, always have a Britney Spears story; is there anything similar with The Onion where they continually revisit a topic or person?
♡❤♡DS: In an interview with &lt;a href="w%3ATerry%20Gross"&gt;Terry Gross&lt;/a&gt;, Stephen Colbert said of his time at &lt;a href="w%3ASecond%20City"&gt;Second City&lt;/a&gt; that they had decided on not doing political humor and, in particular, hackneyed political humor such as &lt;a href="w%3ATed%20Kennedy"&gt;Ted Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; drinking jokes. They felt it was overdone, mean-spirited and not funny. Do your writers have similar rules of thumb?
♡❤♡DS: When you are going through the headlines, is it just you guys sitting around trying to crack each other up?
♡❤♡DS: It’s more analytical and clinical?
♡❤♡DS: If someone is continually telling unfunny jokes, do you eventually fire them?

<h2>The features and the columnists</h2>
♡❤♡DS: Who are the people on the street, the “American Voices”?
♡❤♡DS: They are such a perfect representation of a broad spectrum of people, that it’s funny that you found them all randomly in just one day.
♡❤♡DS: Have you heard if it has affected their lives?

♡❤♡DS: Are there certain columnists who are reader favorites? Are there columnists where you receive consistently positive or consistently negative responses to?
♡❤♡DS: How did he die?
♡❤♡DS: You had a big reaction from the readers upset that Herbert Kornfeld was dead?
♡❤♡DS: So there is no columnist that people write in and say that they aren’t funny, or that they are boring—
♡❤♡DS: Kelly?
♡❤♡DS: Kelly is actually &lt;a href="w%3AWard%20Sutton"&gt;Ward Sutton&lt;/a&gt;, correct?
♡❤♡DS: For a long time, that cartoon confused me, which perhaps speaks to the humor of it. I thought it was a real right-wing &lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20Zionism"&gt;Christian Zionist&lt;/a&gt; syndicated cartoonist who truly exists and that you all were putting it in The Onion out of a sense of irony. 

<h2>The photojournalism</h2>

♡❤♡DS: How does your graphics department find the people for news stories and come up with the images?
♡❤♡DS: Are the images created using professional models or people on the street?
♡❤♡DS: How do you approach people? Do you ask them if they want to be in an ♡❤Onion♡❤ article?
♡❤♡DS: One of my favorites is of a &lt;a href="http%3A//www.theonion.com/content/node/28047"&gt;troubled teen whose parents are always arguing&lt;/a&gt; and it shows them shooting the &lt;a href="w%3ADouble%20bird"&gt;double bird&lt;/a&gt;. So your graphics department will set up the scene and direct them to do that?

<h2>What ♡❤The Onion♡❤ will not publish</h2>
♡❤♡DS: How do you decide when going through the headlines what will be fleshed out as a full story and what goes into the “News in Headlines” section?

♡❤♡DS: What are some topics you have come across that people almost always say, “Oohh, let’s not do that, that’s going into territory we don’t want to go into”?
♡❤♡DS: What are some of those?♡❤♡
♡❤♡DS: What are your no-no words?
♡❤♡DS: Can you give us two?
♡❤♡DS: Why would Furby be on there?

<h2>Reactions to Onion stories</h2>
♡❤♡DS: When your stories are taken as real—such as your story about the child who, &lt;a href="http%3A//web.archive.org/web/20000815214418/http%3A//www.theonion.com/onion3625/harry_potter.html"&gt;after reading Harry Potter&lt;/a&gt;, decided to practice magic since she found out the Bible is just a bunch of ‘boring lies’—

♡❤♡DS: Do you do anything about that or do you think it’s just hysterical?
♡❤♡DS: Is there any one group that does not like ♡❤The Onion♡❤? Evangelicals? Gays? Any particular subculture?
♡❤♡DS: Do you ever receive hate mail?
♡❤♡DS: What is generally the theme of those letters?
♡❤♡DS: Do you get any reaction from public figures and politicians?
♡❤♡DS: Did he say that story was spot on?

<h2>The Presidential Seal</h2>
♡❤♡DS: Speaking of federal issues, what is the status on the use of the &lt;a href="w%3APresidential%20Seal"&gt;Presidential Seal&lt;/a&gt;?
♡❤♡DS: But you actually did ask formal approval to use the seal. Did that come through or did it just die in the water?
♡❤♡DS: So you actually received approval?
♡❤♡DS: You have always asserted that you don’t need formal approval to use it in parody; that you were only asking for approval as a courtesy?

<h2>The Onion's readership</h2>
♡❤♡DS: What is your readership? Since you are a free weekly without hard subscribers, and then you have the Internet site and podcasts, how do you determine your readership?
♡❤♡DS: Similar to ♡❤The Daily Show♡❤ and ♡❤The Colbert Report♡❤, your readership has to be informed to be in on the jokes. How do you feel about being seen as a real news source?
<h2>Future features</h2>
♡❤♡DS: You guys are always coming out with new features, whether it is a podcast, a newscast, a sports section. Is there anything under development right now?
<h2>Handling national tragedies</h2>
♡❤♡DS: When things like the &lt;a href="w%3A9/11"&gt;September 11&lt;/a&gt; attacks happen, how do you gauge when is the time to start addressing it through parody?
♡❤♡DS: I mean anything that is a national horror, like &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt;.
♡❤♡DS: It’s more of an instinctual process that you all go through?
<h2>The Onion movie and Onion News Network</h2>

♡❤♡DS: What is the status of ♡❤The Onion♡❤ movie?
♡❤♡DS: And quietly—
♡❤♡DS: What’s the idea behind the Onion News Network? 
♡❤♡DS: How much do the writers and editors on the print side inform the news network side?

<h2>Relationship with other satirical news programs</h2>
♡❤♡DS: Many of the writers for The Onion have gone on to Daily Show and Colbert. Is there any collusion that you guys ever do, or a relationship that is fostered?

♡❤♡DS: Is there ever a story that has divided the staff, something the writers look back on and say, “Remember ‘Old Soul Goes to Cobbler’ and ♡❤that♡❤ whole issue?!” Something where half of the people thought it should never have been done and the other half thought it was really great?
♡❤♡DS: Do you think your writers are more optimistic or pessimistic about American culture?
<h2>Unsolicited material</h2>
♡❤♡Rory Covey: I was curious about how much unsolicited material you guys get bombarded with?
♡❤♡DS: Do you have a top ten list of the worst solicited ideas? Does anyone keep track of the really bad stuff that is submitted?
♡❤♡DS: Is there anyone who has been famous at ♡❤The Onion♡❤ for submitting over and over again their unsolicited material? 
♡❤♡DS: Have you ever taken an unsolicited idea?
♡❤♡DS: Could you imagine if I pulled out an illustrated journal full of ♡❤brilliant♡❤ ideas right now?
♡❤♡DS: “DO YOU HAPPEN TO REMEMBER A CERTAIN BOB GOURSE AND HIS 347 SUBMISSIONS? THAT WAS ME, ASSHOLES! I’M FUNNY! ♡❤LOOK AT ME NOW IN THE FACE AND TELL ME I’M NOT!♡❤”

Speaking in &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; today, outgoing &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href="w%3ATreasurer%20of%20Australia"&gt;treasurer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Costello"&gt;Peter Costello&lt;/a&gt;, made a shock announcement that he will not stand for leadership of the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;Liberal party&lt;/a&gt; following the &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;Howard&lt;/a&gt; government's defeat in Saturday's election. Mr Costello had been touted by outgoing Prime Minister John Howard as his likely successor.

It is believed that Mr Costello had long dreamed of becoming Prime Minister. The Sydney Morning Herald reports that Mr Costello "looked strained" and that "tears appeared to brim in his eyes" as he made his announcement.

Mr Costello said he would serve out his three year term as member for &lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Higgins"&gt;Higgins&lt;/a&gt; on the backbench, mentoring the up and coming members of the Liberal party before moving on to a career in the private sector.

"The time has come for me to open a new chapter in my life. I will be looking to build a career, post-politics, in the commercial world," he said. "As a consequence of that, I will not seek, nor will I accept, the leadership or deputy leadership of the Liberal Party."

The outgoing treasurer said he believed it was time for young members of the party to have an opportunity to advance the party.

"I do believe that it is time for the young people of talent and ability - of whom there are many - to be given their go in the Liberal Party," he said. "Just as I was given my go in the early 1990s, I think it's time for them to have their go."

&lt;a href="w%3AMalcolm%20Turnbull"&gt;Malcolm Turnbull&lt;/a&gt; has so far been the only Liberal member to indicate his intentions to run for leadership of the Liberal party. "I will be a candidate for the leadership of the Liberal Party at the next party meeting," he said.

"I will deliver, if elected to the leadership of the Liberal Party, the energy and the drive and the determination to win and the commitment to deliver new ideas, new policies, new agendas for the advancement of our country."

After brokering a deal between record companies, film corporations, internet firms and itself, the &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; government has unveiled a new anti-piracy body formed to counter what President &lt;a href="Nicolas%20Sarkozy"&gt;Nicolas Sarkozy&lt;/a&gt; has described as the growing use of the internet as a "lawless zone where outlaws can pillage works with abandon or, worse, trade in them in total impunity".

&lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20service%20provider"&gt;Internet service provider&lt;/a&gt;s will be forced to monitor the activities of their clients, and will restrict access for users known to be partaking in file sharing of selected media. In some cases, ISPs will be instructed to either cut off internet access entirely or threaten to do so.

The French consumer group &lt;a href="w%3AUFC%20Que%20Choisir"&gt;UFC Que Choisir&lt;/a&gt; criticised the deal as being "very tough, potentially destructive of freedom, anti-economic and against digital history".

Film companies have agreed to hasten the cinema-to-DVD process as part of their obligations under the deal, and record companies have indicated future support for the sale of &lt;a href="w%3ADigital%20rights%20management"&gt;Digital Rights Management&lt;/a&gt;-free media in their stores.

The body will be supervised by a judge.

Italian opposition leader and ex-prime minister &lt;a href="w%3ASilvio%20Berlusconi"&gt;Silvio Berlusconi&lt;/a&gt; declared the former alliance known as &lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20of%20Freedoms"&gt;Casa Delle Libertà&lt;/a&gt; (CDL), or ♡❤House of Freedoms♡❤ an "ectoplasm", and called for the creation of a new party, the &lt;a href="w%3AItalian%20People%27s%20Party%20for%20Freedom"&gt;Partito del popolo della Libertà&lt;/a&gt; or ♡❤Italian People's Party for Freedom♡❤. 

He stated last Sunday (25 November), after suddenly disbanding the &lt;a href="w%3AForza%20Italia"&gt;Forza Italia&lt;/a&gt; party a week previously, that this new party will be composed mainly of ex-Forza Italia voters and will take up to 37% of votes. Berlusconi tried to defeat Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ARomano%20Prodi"&gt;Romano Prodi&lt;/a&gt; in the parliament recently, on the Finanziaria, or budget bill, but failed.

In the 18 months since &lt;a href="w%3AAndrea%20Muizelaar"&gt;Andrea Muizelaar&lt;/a&gt; was crowned winner of the reality TV series ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACanada%27s%20Next%20Top%20Model"&gt;Canada's Next Top Model&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, her life has been a complete whirlwind. From working in a dollar store in her hometown of &lt;a href="w%3AWhitby%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Whitby, Ontario&lt;/a&gt;, to modeling &lt;a href="w%3Ahaute%20couture"&gt;haute couture&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AToronto"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt;, she had reached her dream of becoming a true Top Model.

But at what cost? Unknown to casual television viewers, Muizelaar had been enveloped in the eating disorder &lt;a href="w%3Aanorexia%20nervosa"&gt;anorexia nervosa&lt;/a&gt;, which inevitably became too much for her to bear. She gave up modeling and moved back to Whitby, where she sought treatment for her disorder, re-entered college, and now works at a bank. Where is she now? Happy and healthy, she says.

Recently Andrea Muizelaar sat down with Wikinews reporter in a candid interview that stretched to nearly two hours, as she told all about her hopes and aspirations, her battle with anorexia, and just what ♡❤really♡❤ happened on ♡❤Canada's Next Top Model.♡❤

<h2>Andrea's beginnings</h2>

♡❤♡Mike Halterman:♡❤♡ Tell us a bit about your background. We know all about the Andrea we saw on Top Model, but we're interested to hear where you came from. What do your parents do? Did you have any hard times growing up?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ How geeky are we talking here? Worse than any other teenager?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ How long did that last?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ What happened after that point? Did they stop, or did you grow into your looks, or was it something else?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ This was also around the time you wanted to model, right?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ Is that when you first became anorexic?

<h2>Andrea on her road to modeling, and ♡❤America's Next Top Model♡❤</h2>

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ Who were the people you looked up to and inspired you to pursue modeling? Did they have that thin body type that you hoped to have?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ That was actually going to be my next question. Who did you look up to on that show?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ Some of the plus sized girls on that show actually went into rather lucrative careers, like &lt;a href="w%3AToccara%20Jones"&gt;Toccara&lt;/a&gt; from Cycle 3, probably more so than some of the thinner winners. How do you feel about that, and how would you have felt about such an event occurring before you overcame your anorexia?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ Definitely. On that note, do you feel there is such a thing as "perfect" in terms of image in fashion?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ Even with the Toccaras and &lt;a href="w%3ATyra%20Banks"&gt;Tyra Banks&lt;/a&gt; of the world?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ That is true. Do you think Tyra Banks picks the bigger models for "good TV" instead of actually succeeding in modeling?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ There was a big hype over Tyra picking Whitney and Diana for ANTM 8, which was the first time two plus sized girls made it into the final rounds. They were both eliminated midway through the competition. That year &lt;a href="w%3AJaslene%20Gonzalez"&gt;Jaslene&lt;/a&gt; won. Do you think her look is unhealthy in terms of how it's promoted to the public and young girls?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ Do you believe the producers for shows such as Top Model intentionally pick people who are perhaps unstable, whether it be with body image or otherwise?

<h2>Experience on ♡❤Canada's Next Top Model♡❤</h2>

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ This question was asked by Steff Groulx, who was on Canada's Next Top Model, Cycle 2. "Do you think the experience you had on the show was what you thought it would be?"

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ In the third episode, the photographer who was the guest judge that week made a comment that he wanted to take you "to get something to eat," and then criticized fellow contestant Natalie for being "a bit big" for modeling. Did you feel you had the worst criticism, or do you think it was evenly spread out among all the girls?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ Right, you had some big concerns. Ylenia also had self-image concerns while on the show, but we don't know of her full story. Do you still keep in contact with her, and if so, is she in a better state of mind now?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ &lt;a href="w%3ATricia%20Helfer"&gt;Tricia Helfer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACanada%2527s_Next_Top_Model%252C_Cycle_1%23Episode_4%3A_Topping_It_All_Off"&gt;hired a personal trainer&lt;/a&gt; for an episode, and he told you to revise your diet and to gain weight in your backside and in your thighs. Were you afraid to listen to him or did you mentally process his tips but were hesitant anyway?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ He was also the same guest who memorably destroyed a scale with a sledgehammer. Since Tricia Helfer invited him, do you feel that she was sincere about wanting all the contestants to be healthy? Did she know you had an eating disorder?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ After the Pantene photo shoot, at panel, all the judges criticized your weight, specifically that you didn't weigh enough, and you later became defensive and said you ate well. This was interspersed with an interview from Alanna who said she never saw you eat a full meal the entire time you were in the house. The mantra quickly became "Andrea, you need to eat!" Now my question is, do you feel that they truly cared about whether you ate or not, and do you think that mantra was just an excuse to go, "Well, I did say she needed to eat..."?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ What would you hypothesize is the reason for the disconnect between the fashion industry's definitions of "health," "attractiveness," and "beauty," and what most people, completely unrelated to the fashion industry, would see as healthy, attractive and beautiful?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ &lt;a href="w%3ATwiggy"&gt;Twiggy&lt;/a&gt; herself has noted that models were more full-figured and traditionally "beautiful" before she came along, and that she thinks she may be a trend-setter in that regard. If you believe that's true, then do you think that she should be telling other potential models how to fit in "the mold," since she was the one who broke it in the first place?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ In your opinion, who do you think had the bigger impact? Is it one model? A series of models?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ But you don't feel it's correct for Twiggy to "claim ownership" of today's "model look," as it were?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ Do you feel that there are certain good qualities that the fashion industry has, and if so, what are they?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ Alanna was bigger than you were, but still rather average in terms of everyday women. If she had won and not you, do you think she would have had a tougher time breaking into high fashion?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ Alanna was a very strong competitor. Do you feel the final two was a good choice, or should someone else have taken Alanna's place?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ One constant criticism by the judges and by fans was that you lacked confidence, and certain times in the series you questioned why you were competing against girls you felt were "better than you." Why did you feel that way? Was your body image a factor, and if so, how much of a factor? What other factors were there in the way you felt?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ The CityTV final episode online viewer poll had the question "Should Andrea have won CNTM?" and the response was overwhelmingly in favor of "No, Andrea shouldn't have been CNTM! She's too skinny and the crying gets annoying!" Was hiding your anorexia the reason why you were as emotional as you were?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ You made a comment during the series that you felt Stacey McKenzie was the most critical and belittling of the judges. Toward the second half of the competition, &lt;a href="w%3ACanada%2527s_Next_Top_Model%252C_Cycle_1%23Episode_6%3A_Beauty_Is_As_Beauty_Poses"&gt;you spent an entire afternoon alone with her&lt;/a&gt; at the house and it was shown that you two bonded. Do you feel that day really made you feel better about how Stacey viewed you? 

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ Please elaborate. Her "true colors" in what sense?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ Which judge do you feel was perhaps the most genuine in terms of behavior on-screen and off?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ There's been criticism on America's Next Top Model that Tyra Banks and the care that she shows to her models is an act for TV. Do you think Tricia Helfer is the opposite?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ Jay Manuel now hosts, and it's weird to see because he's in a different mode than he is on America's Next Top Model, where he's often very blunt and sarcastic. [...] Toward the end, there was a lot of rather cruel teasing towards you coming from Alanna and Brandi. As you may remember, it culminated in the night &lt;a href="w%3ACanada%2527s_Next_Top_Model%252C_Cycle_1%23Episode_7%3A_Get_Ready.2C_Get_Set.2C_Go_See.21"&gt;they went through your belongings&lt;/a&gt; and then tampered with a "treat" they prepared for you and Sisi. It wasn't a complete 180 in behavior, per se, but it did get very nasty very quickly. Why do you think they acted the way they did? Also, you were never shown confronting them for what they did. Did you end up doing so? Finally, did you know the extent of all they had done right away, or did you not find out until you actually saw the episode on television?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ What did the producers say? On TV, due to editing, it comes across as Alanna and Brandi deciding to be nosy and poke through your things.

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ And they didn't know you had any before that time?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ After the final runway show, you did a private interview and you said something that stuck out. "I have learned so much about being a woman, about being a model, about being beautiful." Considering what happened to you during the competition and later on, do you still feel what you learned was genuine? If not, what do you feel isn't genuine, and what good things did you bring from the experience?

<h2>The message she wrote to her fans on her facebook group</h2>

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ You wrote that you decided to audition for Canada's Next Top Model knowing that you would have to perpetuate an image of unhealthiness and false images of beauty. Why did you choose to go down that road if you knew of the risks?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ You seem to describe a battle of what you wanted more, which in this case, modeling almost won out over your health. What finally made you realize that modeling became too much to bear, and why did modeling mean that much to you?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ When your health faltered, that's when you said, "No, I can't do this anymore"?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ Do you feel that there should have been more of a fine line drawn between the money you received, between "prize" and "work," for tax purposes?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ You discuss many horrible housing situations during your reign as Top Model. Were you not allowed to make your own decisions as far as housing was concerned?

<h2>Her brief modeling career</h2>

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ Your spread in ♡❤Fashion♡❤ magazine only paid $500. Is that a competitive rate for models or do you feel that you were paid less because you were under your television contract?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ Why do you feel CityTV did not back you, as you say they were going to, during the lawsuit with your previous agency?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ The Canadian website Canoe said you had alleged that &lt;a href="w%3AJeanne%20Beker"&gt;Jeanne Beker&lt;/a&gt;, a judge on the show, effectively "ruined your career." Can you elaborate on what was meant by that, and do you indeed feel she ruined your career?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ A big criticism of Top Model winners is that they don't go on to do many big fashion-related events, such as runway shows or photoshoots. Do you feel that was the case with you? In the year you did pursue modeling, who did you model for, and what shows did you walk in?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ Another question from Steff Groulx from CNTM 2: "Why did you go from wanting to be Canada's Next Top Model to not wanting it at all?"

<h2>"Happy and healthy"</h2>

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ You're going back to college for business administration. What do you want to do with your degree?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ How do you feel when people tell you that you looked so beautiful in your modeling pictures back when you had anorexia?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ Do you feel you've fully grown into your "own skin," so to speak, as far as your self-confidence goes now that you have left modeling?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ When you have a daughter of your own and she wants to become a model, would you approve of her choice to go into modeling?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ Finally, what is your message to the girls of Canada who have big dreams of their own? What would you tell them?

Health authorities from the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organization"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WHO) and the government of &lt;a href="Angola"&gt;Angola&lt;/a&gt; have revealed that bromide poisoning may be the source of a mystery illness first reported in early October.

The outbreak of over 400 reported cases of a neurological disorder was centred in the &lt;a href="w%3ACacuaco"&gt;Cacuaco&lt;/a&gt; district of Angola's capital city &lt;a href="w%3ALuanda"&gt;Luanda&lt;/a&gt;. A majority of the afflicted have been children under the age of 15. There have been no deaths attributed directly to the disorder.

According to a statement in the state-run ♡❤AngolaPress♡❤, symptoms have included "sleepiness, blear-eyedness, dizziness and difficulty to speak, walk and extreme tiredness." WHO described the drowsiness as being so severe that the patient would require "painful stimuli" to be awoken.

Results from laboratory tests carried out in &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMunich"&gt;Munich&lt;/a&gt; indicated elevated levels of bromide present in the blood and kitchen salt samples examined. It is suspected that &lt;a href="w%3ASodium%20chloride"&gt;sodium chloride&lt;/a&gt; (table salt) may have been contaminated with sodium bromide, an agent used in pharmaceuticals and industry.

However, authorities caution that more investigation is required to determine the source and cause of the illness. Consequently, further testing of blood, food and water has been initiated.

On Wednesday, WHO dispatched additional technical and support personnel to Angola to assist local health officials.

In six hours, dozens of young people in &lt;a href="w%3ASarcelles"&gt;Sarcelles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AVilliers-le-Bel"&gt;Villiers-le-Bel&lt;/a&gt;, a suburb of &lt;a href="Paris"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, attacked a police station, burned cars and broke into shops after two teenagers were killed in a car crash with a police vehicle. The station was pelted with &lt;a href="w%3AMolotov%20cocktail"&gt;Molotov cocktail&lt;/a&gt;s and guns were fired at officers inside the station.

A police captain, who tried to negotiate with the youths, had to be hospitalized with serious injuries to the face. The youths also set several cars ablaze. According to police, at least 21 officers were injured in rioting in Villiers-le-Bel and Arnouville. The police station in Villiers-le-Bel was set on fire and the one in Arnouville was ransacked.

Two hours before, a police patrol vehicle collided with two teenagers riding a stolen green mini cross motorbike without helmets. The teens, aged 15 and 16, were both killed in the accident which took place in Villiers-le-Bel.

Didier Vaillant, mayor of Villers-le-Bel, appealed for calm and assured there will be "an impartial investigation, for full light to be shed" on the accident. 

Omar Sehhouli, brother to one of the dead teenagers, said the unrest "was not violence but an expression of rage."

Over 2,000 people, world-class runners, corporate teams and individual people, participated in the challenge to climb 2046 steps (390 meters height), 91 floors at the 3rd 2007 Taipei 101 Run Up yesterday. Before the race, the host (&lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20101"&gt;Taipei 101&lt;/a&gt;) donated &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan%20dollar"&gt;NT$&lt;/a&gt;204,600 to the Foundation of the &lt;a href="w%3A2009%20Summer%20Deaflympics"&gt;21st Summer Deaflympics&lt;/a&gt; Organizing Committee for the preparation fund of the 21st Summer Deaflympics.

&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; cyclist &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Crake"&gt;Paul Crake&lt;/a&gt; wasn't able to defend his championship this year, as he is currently trying to recover from a spinal injury, suffered in &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; last year, which may leave his legs paralyzed. The host invited &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; runner &lt;a href="w%3Ait%3AMarco%20De%20Gasperi"&gt;Marco De Gasperi&lt;/a&gt;, the champion of the 2007 &lt;a href="w%3APirelli%20Tower"&gt;Pirelli Tower&lt;/a&gt; Run Up, to participate in the 91-floors race instead. 

De Gasperi won the title in the Men's Elite Group with a time of 11 min and 39.48 seconds. &lt;a href="Austria"&gt;Austrian&lt;/a&gt; runner &lt;a href="w%3Ade%3AAndrea%20Mayr"&gt;Andrea Mayr&lt;/a&gt; successfully retained her title in Women's Elite Group with a time of 12 min and 54.07 seconds. This was good attendance from both the public and media for the races.

After the races in the Elite and Self-Challenge classes, the race in the Enterprise class started with participation from Synnex Taiwan, Continental Engineering Corporation, &lt;a href="w%3ALeadtek"&gt;Leadtek&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AL%27Or%C3%A9al"&gt;L'Oréal&lt;/a&gt; Taiwan, Taipei City Government, Taipei City Fire Department (TCFD), Taiwan Farmers' Party (led by former KMT Legislator Chun-hsiung Ko), and school members from "Cross-Strait Elite Students' Group" at "Campus of Creative Sports Industry for Cross-Strait College Students" by Chinese Development Foundation and Mainland Affairs Council of Executive Yuan.

With the Direct General of TCFD Kuang-hua Hsiung's lead and witnesses by media and public, TCFD showed their actual strengths with their greatest team-works and finally won the Champion of Enterprise Group even though they preceded the champion award to Changhua Bank, former Title Sponsor and Champion of Enterprise Group at 2006 in this race. Two teams from &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Central%20University"&gt;National Central University&lt;/a&gt; (NCU Taiwan) also won the 2nd and 3rd place in this race with current Principal of NCU Taiwan Dr. Luo-chuang Li's lead.

Even though "Cross-Strait Elite Students' Group" was included in the Enterprise class, but this friendship match was set for improving Cross-Strait (&lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Hong%20Kong"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;) relationships by Chinese Development Foundation. A student named Wang showed his best performance and helped his team (Department of Social Work, &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Taipei%20University"&gt;National Taipei University&lt;/a&gt;) won the group champion in this friendship race.

The outgoing &lt;a href="w%3ADeputy%20Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Deputy Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Vaile"&gt;Mark Vaile&lt;/a&gt; today announced that he will resign as leader of the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;National party&lt;/a&gt;, following the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt;/National party coalition government's defeat on Saturday. Mr Vaile took leadership of the National party after &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Anderson"&gt;John Anderson's&lt;/a&gt; resignation in July, 2005.

With his wife by his side, an emotional Mark Vaile said that he had considered his future in wake of the coalition's defeat and that he believed it was time for change within the National party.

"Over the last couple of days and particularly as I drove to &lt;a href="w%3ACanberra"&gt;Canberra&lt;/a&gt; this morning with Wendy to come down and start packing up my office to make way for the incoming deputy prime minister, we reflected on a whole range of issues," he said.

"We are at a point in the history of politics in Australia where we believe and I believe it is time for an opportunity for a bit of a change in the leadership of our party. I certainly don't want to stand in the way of that."

Mr Vaile said that the past 11 or so years had been particularly difficult for his family. "It's been a long 10 or 11 years for my family whilst I've been away from home and they deserve a bit of time and that's what I want to give them," said Mr Vaile.

Mr Vaile said he accepted some of the responsibility for the coalition's defeat on the weekend. "As the leader of my party I shoulder my share of the responsibility for the outcome on Saturday," he said.

Mr Vaile also dismissed Liberal &lt;a href="w%3AWilson%20Tuckey"&gt;Wilson Tuckey&lt;/a&gt;'s suggestion that the Liberals and Nationals should amalgamate. He said he continued to oppose the idea.

"As far as amalgamation is concerned I've opposed it in the past and I'll oppose it in the future," he said.

"My belief is that regional Australia is entitled to their unique voice and that's always been given to them by the Nationals and we have had proposals in terms of amalgamation, I've argued against it then and I'll argue against it in the future."

Mr Vaile will continue to serve the remainder of his term for his constituency of &lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Lyne"&gt;Lyne&lt;/a&gt; on the backbench.

Four civilians driving southwest of &lt;a href="w%3AKabul"&gt;Kabul&lt;/a&gt; were killed after a &lt;a href="w%3Alandmine"&gt;landmine&lt;/a&gt; exploded underneath their car. The head of criminal investigation in the Kabul police force, Ali Shah Paktiawal issued the following statement on the matter: "It was an old landmine that exploded in the &lt;a href="w%3AChar%20Asiab%20District"&gt;Char Asiab District&lt;/a&gt; this morning and killed four people. It was not a roadside bomb or a recently planted mine."

There are over 100,000 unexploded landmines in &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, planted in recent and older conflicts by the &lt;a href="w%3ASoviet"&gt;Soviet&lt;/a&gt; military and the &lt;a href="w%3ATaliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt;. An average of sixty people a month are killed by mines.

Senior officials from nearly 50 countries and international organizations have gathered in &lt;a href="w%3AAnnapolis"&gt;Annapolis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Maryland"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href="Washington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; for a conference aimed at launching final-status peace negotiations between &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="Palestine"&gt;Palestinians&lt;/a&gt;. The meeting, the product of months of &lt;a href="Middle%20East"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt; diplomacy by the Bush administration, is intended to reopen peace talks between the two sides for the first time in seven years.

The conference, hosted by the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20State"&gt;United States Department of State&lt;/a&gt;, has been dubbed the &lt;a href="w%3AAnnapolis%20Conference"&gt;Annapolis Conference&lt;/a&gt;. "Our purpose here in Annapolis is not to conclude an agreement. Rather, it is to launch negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians," said President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; at the first formal session of the conference. "The time is right, the cause is just, and with hard effort, I know they can succeed."

Bush said that direct negotiations for a Palestinian state will begin December 12. "Such a state will provide Palestinians with the chance to lead lives of freedom, purpose and dignity," Bush said. He hopes a solution be found before he leaves office.

As the summit got underway, thousands of people demonstrated in &lt;a href="w%3AGaza%20City"&gt;Gaza City&lt;/a&gt;. "Let them go to a thousand conferences, we say in the name of the Palestinian people that we did not authorise anyone to sign any agreement that harms our rights," said &lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud%20al-Zahar"&gt;Mahmoud al-Zahar&lt;/a&gt;, a co-founder of &lt;a href="w%3AHamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="Mahmoud%20Abbas"&gt;Mahmoud Abbas&lt;/a&gt; has no right to make concessions to the Israelis he said. "Abbas is a traitor" and "Death to Israel, death to America," the crowd chanted.

The Prime Minster of Israel, &lt;a href="Ehud%20Olmert"&gt;Ehud Olmert&lt;/a&gt; said: "This time it's different because we are going to have lots of participants in what I hope will launch a serious process of negotiations between us and the Palestinians."

Mahmoud Abbas, President of the &lt;a href="w%3APalestinian%20National%20Authority"&gt;Palestinian National Authority&lt;/a&gt; said: "We have a great deal of hope that this conference will produce... expanded negotiations over all permanent-status issues that would lead to a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinian people."

Observers have noted that the summit has attracted the participation of &lt;a href="Saudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;&amp;mdash;two &lt;a href="w%3AArab"&gt;Arab&lt;/a&gt; states that do not recognize Israel&amp;mdash;and say that this is critical to chances for success. 

The conference began informally last night with a dinner hosted by US Secretary of State &lt;a href="Condoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt;. "We've come together this week because we share a common goal: two democratic states&amp;mdash;Israel and Palestine&amp;mdash;living side by side in peace and security," Bush said in an address to the participants. "I'm encouraged by the presence of so many here. Achieving this goal requires the commitment of the international community, including the United States," he continued.

<h1>Students protest Holocaust denier's appearance at Oxford debate</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Students%20protest%20Holocaust%20denier%27s%20appearance%20at%20Oxford%20debate&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A group of about 500 demonstrators protested the presence of &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Irving"&gt;David Irving&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="England"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; historian and convicted &lt;a href="w%3AHolocaust%20denial"&gt;Holocaust denier&lt;/a&gt;, at a debate at &lt;a href="w%3AOxford%20University"&gt;Oxford University&lt;/a&gt; on Monday. The students broke into the Oxford Union building where the debate was being held and delayed the debate for over an hour.

British riot police were on the scene to maintain the peace. The demonstrators gathered in front of the building hours before the debate was to begin and later staged a sit-down protest in the building's halls. Only half of the people who had tickets to the debate were able to enter the building due to the protests. David Irving and &lt;a href="w%3ANick%20Griffin"&gt;Nick Griffin&lt;/a&gt;, a leader of the far-right &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20National%20Party"&gt;British National Party&lt;/a&gt; who also participated in the debate, were forced to be separated and placed in different rooms. One protester was reportedly injured after a blow to the head.

The topic of the debate was &lt;a href="w%3Afree%20speech"&gt;free speech&lt;/a&gt;. It was organized by the &lt;a href="w%3AOxford%20Union"&gt;Oxford Union&lt;/a&gt;, who voted Friday to allow Irving to speak, amid controversy. The protest was organized by the activist group Unite Against Fascism, as well as members of the &lt;a href="w%3AOxford%20University%20Student%20Union"&gt;Oxford University Student Union&lt;/a&gt; and Oxford's &lt;a href="w%3AJudaism"&gt;Jewish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AIslam"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; societies.

Luke Tryl, president of the Oxford Union, defended the decision to allow Irving to speak, saying that the purpose of the debate was to discuss the limits of free speech, not to give the speakers a platform from which to endorse their views. Ned Temko, chief political correspondent of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Observer"&gt;The Observer&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, disagreed, saying, "It's not a question about giving them a platform, it's about giving them credibility."

From February to December 2006, David Irving was jailed in &lt;a href="Austria"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt; after being convicted of identifying with the &lt;a href="w%3ANazi%20Party"&gt;Nazi Party&lt;/a&gt;. He has written several books which deny the Holocaust and support the views of Adolf Hitler. In 1998, an English court found that he is "an active Holocaust denier; that he is &lt;a href="w%3AAnti-Semitism"&gt;anti-Semitic&lt;/a&gt; and racist and that he associates with right-wing extremists who promote neo-Nazism." Nick Griffin is the National Chairman of the British National Party, a &lt;a href="w%3Anationalism"&gt;nationalist&lt;/a&gt; group known for its &lt;a href="w%3Anativist"&gt;anti-immigration&lt;/a&gt; and anti-Muslim policies. In 1998, he was also convicted of denying the Holocaust.

Monday night more than sixty &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; police officers have been left injured after a second night of running battles with youths in &lt;a href="Paris"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; suburb, &lt;a href="w%3AVilliers-le-Bel"&gt;Villiers-le-Bel&lt;/a&gt;. The rioting began Sunday night after two teenagers on a motorbike died after a collision with a police patrol vehicle.

36 vehicles were set ablaze, including a garbage truck and a police vehicle. A witness told Reuters that police were pelted with stones, petrol bombs and large firecrackers. Police responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and paint guns. BBC reports that two schools, a library and shops were badly damaged as violence spread to five towns in the &lt;a href="w%3AVal-d%27Oise"&gt;Val-d'Oise&lt;/a&gt; department.

President &lt;a href="Nicolas%20Sarkozy"&gt;Nicolas Sarkozy&lt;/a&gt;, who is on a state visit to &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, urged calm. "I call on everyone to calm down and let the justice system decide who was responsible," he said in &lt;a href="w%3ABeijing"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt;.

In a final tally of Sunday's violence, officials said 28 cars and five buildings were set ablaze, including a police station. There were 26 police and fire officers injured. Nine people were arrested on Sunday.

In 2005, France saw more than two weeks of &lt;a href="w%3A2005%20civil%20unrest%20in%20France"&gt;civil unrest&lt;/a&gt; in violence that was also triggered by the death of two teenagers.

<h1>UK prime minister says donations were not lawfully declared</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=UK%20prime%20minister%20says%20donations%20were%20not%20lawfully%20declared&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The Prime Minister of the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Gordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt; has announced that donations made to his political party, the &lt;a href="w%3ALabour%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Labour Party&lt;/a&gt; were "not lawfully declared" as they were donated through a middleman. According to UK law, all donations over &lt;a href="w%3APound%20sterling"&gt;£&lt;/a&gt;50,000 must be declared along with the name of the donator and all donations made through middlemen must declare the original donator. David Abraham officially donated the money, which totaled almost £600,000, through 3 third parties. They have been named as; Ray Ruddick who donated £196,850 since 2003, Janet Kidd, who has donated £185,000 since 2003 and John McCarthy, who has donated £202,125 since 2004.
Gordon Brown said he had "no knowledge" of these donations and said "they can not be justified" and that it will be returned. Brown said that although this practice has happened for some years, he was first aware of it on Saturday evening. "The money was not lawfully declared so it will be returned," he said.

As well as returning the money, the general secretary of the Labour Party has stood down as a result of this incident. This scandal emerged just months after it was announced there will be no charges in the cash for honours inquiry, which was related to donations to the Labour Party as well as other political parties.

This could be another blow to the Labour Party, who appear to be facing a sharp decline in popularity, with some polls suggesting they are even less popular than in the last days of &lt;a href="Tony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt;'s premiership, despite a large surge in popularity when Brown came to power.

The acting leader of the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Democrats"&gt;Liberal Democrats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Vince%20Cable"&gt;Vince Cable&lt;/a&gt;, whose party suffered from the increase in Labour's popularity said "an enormous can of worms had been opened up" and that the UK government should have introduced new regulations on the funding of political parties.

<h1>Mascots for Vancouver 2010 Olympics based on native mythology</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Mascots%20for%20Vancouver%202010%20Olympics%20based%20on%20native%20mythology&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The mascots of the &lt;a href="w%3A2010%20Winter%20Olympics"&gt;2010 Winter Olympics&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AVancouver%2C%20British%20Columbia"&gt;Vancouver, British Columbia&lt;/a&gt; were just announced. Based on mythological characters, they are Miga, Quatchi and Sumi.

Miga, a sea bear who lives in the ocean with her family pod near &lt;a href="w%3ATofino"&gt;Tofino&lt;/a&gt;, and Quatchi, a young sasquatch, represent the Olympics, while Sumi represents the Paralympics that follow afterward.

A sea bear is a First Nations creature, part killer whale, part Kermode spirit bear. While illustrated as being taller than the other characters, the mascot costume of Quatchi is the same height as the other two characters.

The third mascot, Sumi, an animal-guardian spirit, is a Thunderbird that wears the hat of an orca. Sumi will be the mascot of the Paralympics.

In 2004, the ♡❤Times Colonist♡❤ suggested a marmot might be a good mascot, except for their winter hibernation. The organizers still chose one, named Mukmuk, as their "virtual only" counterpart.

After the Olympic logo design was leaked the day before the 2005 announcement, organizers were extremely tight lipped until today's news conference at a Surrey school. They apparently didn't do any development on the characters on internet-enabled computers, to ensure the images or information wouldn't slip out.

The characters were designed by the Vancouver and Los Angeles-based Meomi Design. Their characters have been used as part of &lt;a href="w%3AiGoogle"&gt;iGoogle&lt;/a&gt;, a customizable homepage option from Google, as well as Electronic Arts, Girls Inc., Time Out Magazine, Cyworld, Nick Jr., Bang-on Clothing, and CBC4Kids.

The Vancouver organizers have a CDN$46-million merchandising program; previous Olympics have made as much as $100 million from mascot-related products.

René Fasel, Chairman of the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) Coordination Commission commented that "The IOC welcomes these imaginative new additions to the Olympic Family as they take their place on the world stage today - a symbol of the Games and of Canada. We know that when Olympians, Paralympians and visitors from around the globe arrive in British Columbia at Games time, they will fall under the spell of these captivating characters."

The characters first appearance will be at a Bay store in the Lower Mainland; HBC is a major sponsor of the Games. They will then make their way to schools, take a break through the Christmas season, and fly to Ottawa for the Winterlude festival.

<h2>Response to designs</h2>

Many respondents on the CBC.ca forums complained that the characters were poorly designed, and objected to the anime influence. One early commenter posted: "these mascots do represent BC very well... someone must have been smoking A LOT of BC bud when they created these things. Maybe the dealer was that marmot that no one can see."

One poster suggests the Miga character is inaccurate: "Family pods are residential (not transients or offshore!) who prefer sheltered water." According to the poster, they are "rarely seen" on the west coast of Vancouver Island, where Tofino is.

One forum poster took offense to the characters: "As a person ... of full First Nations descent I want to say that these mascots are offensive."

Some felt that they were a nice change of pace, from the "regular run-of-the-mill Canadiana that has been recycled over and over again. Vancouver is a new city for new things and fresh faces, a place for experimentation... I think we need to remember that these characters are for the kids and for fun. What kind of a statement would trotting out another red and white beaver and moose make? That we are imaginative with new ideas? They'll grow on us."

<h2>Earlier logo design a dud say some</h2>

Native offense to the Vancouver Olympic mascots would not be unheard of.

While the Olympic logo was applauded by various First Nations and Inuit leaders, including the Nunavut premier, one criticized the image for the Games as looking like the video game character &lt;a href="w%3APac%20Man"&gt;Pac Man&lt;/a&gt;. Local leaders complained it didn't represent their cultures, but the culture of the far north; interestingly the logo designer was of sure &lt;a href="w%3AHaida"&gt;Haida&lt;/a&gt; ancestry.

Nunavut Commissioner Peter Irniq complained that traditional inuksuit (inuksuk) never had a head, legs, or arms. Irniq says that the logo resembles an inunguat, which is a much more recent invention made by non-Inuit people in Nunavut.

Roughly 1600 designs were submitted. Similarly, the mascot design process was open to all, but there was no word yet on numbers of entrants.

The British Columbian chapter of the Society of Graphic Designers of Canada took issue with the "token" amount of money paid to the winner, compared to the work done and the fact the images were those of VANOC in perpetuity, with no usage fees paid. VANOC later approached the Society, to set minimum standards for the design.

&lt;a href="w%3ASean%20Taylor"&gt;Sean Taylor&lt;/a&gt;, starting &lt;a href="w%3ASafety%20%28American%20football%29"&gt;safety&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20Redskins"&gt;Washington Redskins&lt;/a&gt;, died this morning from injuries sustained in a shooting Monday in his Miami, Florida home. The hard-hitting safety was a &lt;a href="w%3APro%20Bowl"&gt;Pro Bowl&lt;/a&gt; selection last season, and was second in the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Football%20League"&gt;National Football League&lt;/a&gt; (NFL) this season in interceptions, with five.

Police responded to a 911 emergency call by Taylor's girlfriend at 1:45 a.m. EST (UTC-5) Monday morning. "According to a preliminary investigation, it appears that the victim was shot inside the home by an intruder," said Miami-Dade police in a statement. "We do not have a subject description at this time."

Taylor's father, Pedro Taylor released a statement on behalf of the family, stating "It is with deep regret that a young man had to come to his end so soon."
NFL Commissioner &lt;a href="w%3ARoger%20Goodell"&gt;Roger Goodell&lt;/a&gt; said "We extend our heartfelt sympathy to Sean's family, friends, teammates, and the Redskins' organization. This is a terrible tragedy involving the loss of a young man who leaves behind many people struggling to understand it. Our office is staying in close contact with the Redskins to provide all appropriate support to the club and Sean's family. We also are working to determine the facts surrounding this tragic event."

Goodell added that all 32 NFL teams would honor the memory of the late Redskins' star.

Redskins' owner Daniel Snyder said, "This is the worst imaginable tragedy. Our thoughts and prayers are with Sean's family."

<h1>British teacher faces 40 lashes over teddy bear's name</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=British%20teacher%20faces%2040%20lashes%20over%20teddy%20bear%27s%20name&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A &lt;a href="w%3AGreat%20Britain"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; teacher working in &lt;a href="Sudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt; was arrested on Sunday after parents allegedly complained that she had insulted Islam by naming a teddy bear Muhammad. She faces a possible six months in prison, 40 lashes, or a fine.

<h3>A blasphemous bear?</h3>
Gillian Gibbons, 54, who had arrived at Khartoum's &lt;a href="w%3AUnity%20High%20School%20%28Sudan%29"&gt;Unity High School&lt;/a&gt; in August, polled the six and seven year old children in her class on what they should call the bear. Out of 8 names, including Abdullah and Hassan, the children overwhelmingly voted for Muhammad, by 20 votes to 3.

The bear was named back in September, as part of a teaching assignment. Each weekend a child would take it home, and write a diary of what they had done with the bear. These accounts were collected in a book with a picture of the teddy on the front, along with the message "My name is Muhammad". The bear itself was not labeled or marked with the name.

On Sunday, November 25, as a group of angry men chanted threats, the police arrested Ms Gibbons at her lodgings in the School. The book has also been seized, and police want to question the bear's 7 year old owner.

Since her arrest she has been moved from a local police station to Sudan's Criminal Investigation Department headquarters for interrogation. British consular officials were initially refused permission to see her, but were allowed to leave food and water. Colleagues from the school have however been able to visit, and consular access was eventually provided. 

The British embassy in Khartoum has not been able to confirm whether the teacher has formally been charged.

<h3>School reaction</h3>
Director Robert Boulos has closed the school until January for fear of reprisals. "This is a very sensitive issue," he said.

He stressed that there was no deliberate insult: "This was a completely innocent mistake. Miss Gibbons would have never wanted to insult Islam." Mr Boulos was also confident she would not face a jail sentence.

However, in an Arabic statement sent to More4 News last night, Unity High School announced that Mrs Gibbons' employment with the school was being terminated with immediate effect:

The Sudanese Media Centre, which is linked to the government, reports that that Ms Gibbons' actions had "met with wide condemnation by guardians of the students", but colleagues of Ms Gibbons claimed that no such complaints had been received by any of the children's parents. 

<h3>Legal escalation</h3>
Sudan's Justice Minister, Mohammed Ali Mardhi, ordered General Prosecutor Salaheddin Abu Zaid to take personal charge of the case. 

If charged with insulting the &lt;a href="w%3AMuhammad"&gt;Prophet Muhammad&lt;/a&gt;, regarded as blasphemy under Sudan's &lt;a href="w%3ASharia"&gt;Sharia&lt;/a&gt; law, Ms Gibbons faces 40 lashes or six month's imprisonment - but the prosecutor has suggested that more serious charges could follow. He is continuing to question witnesses, and there are unconfirmed reports that blasphemy charges have already been brought, and that charges of sedition are being considered.

<h3>International reaction</h3>
The British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, expressed sorrow about what has happened to Ms Gibbons, and stated that contacts had been made with the Sudanese government and police to "clarify" the situation.

Louise Ellman, Labour MP for Liverpool Riverside, called for the release of Ms Gibbons, stating: "I hope that the Foreign Office will do everything they can to calm the situation. I will be giving every assistance I can."

Dr Muhammad Abdul Bari, of the &lt;a href="w%3AMuslim%20Council%20of%20Britain"&gt;Muslim Council of Britain&lt;/a&gt;, said that Ms Gibbons should never have been arrested in the first place, and called on the Sudanese government to intervene in the case with a view to ensuring that she is released without delay.

In contrast to official statements within Sudan, the Sudanese Embassy in the UK has downplayed the whole affair, saying that the "minute" issue would soon be resolved.

<h3>Speculation</h3>
Some commentators have suggested other contributing factors in this furore:
<ul>
BULLET::::- Britain's criticism of the Sudanese government's human rights record in &lt;a href="w%3ADarfur"&gt;Darfur&lt;/a&gt; may have angered the Sudanese authorities.
BULLET::::- Teachers at the school have suggested that a colleague with a grudge against the school, rather than parents, might be the source for the complaints.
BULLET::::- Bishop Ezekiel Kondo, chairman of the school council, suggested that the affair could be related to a tax dispute between the school and the Sudanese authorities.
BULLET::::- Canadian radio commentators have suggested that the &lt;a href="w%3AJyllands-Posten_Muhammad_cartoons_controversy"&gt;Danish cartoon controversy&lt;/a&gt; in 2005 may have increased the Muslim sensitivity to this issue.

On Tuesday, &lt;a href="Google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; announced a new strategic initiative aimed at producing electricity from &lt;a href="w%3ARenewable%20energy"&gt;renewable energy&lt;/a&gt; sources such as &lt;a href="w%3Asolar%20energy"&gt;solar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Awind%20power"&gt;wind&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3Ageothermal%20power"&gt;geothermal&lt;/a&gt; power that is cheaper than electricity produced from &lt;a href="w%3Acoal"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt;. Google plans to spend tens of millions of dollars on research and development in 2008, and to invest hundreds of millions of dollars to bring energy projects to market.

The new initiative is dubbed "RE&lt;C", for "Renewable Energy Cheaper than Coal." It will "focus initially on advanced solar thermal power, wind power technologies, enhanced geothermal systems and other potential breakthrough technologies," according to the company's press release.

"We see technologies we think can mature into very capable industries that can generate electricity cheaper than coal, and we don’t see people talking about that as much as we would like," said Google Co-founder &lt;a href="w%3ALarry%20Page"&gt;Larry Page&lt;/a&gt;. "Solar thermal technology, for example, provides a very plausible path to providing renewable energy cheaper than coal... We are aware of several promising technologies, and believe there are many more out there."

Page said that Google's goal is "to produce one gigawatt of renewable energy capacity that is cheaper than coal," and that the company is "optimistic this can be done in years, not decades."

According to the company press release, one gigawatt is enough to power a city the size of &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Franscisco"&gt;San Franscisco&lt;/a&gt;.

Some &lt;a href="w%3AWall%20Street"&gt;Wall Street&lt;/a&gt; analysts questioned the wisdom of Google's new initiative.

"I’ve written off Google’s competition as a threat to Google’s long-term market share gains," said Jordan Rohan of RBC Capital Markets. "But I haven’t written off Google’s own ability to stretch too far and try to do too much. Ultimately, that is the biggest risk in the Google story."

Rohan added that "The only positive byproduct of this project that would be anything other than environmental is that it might make Google managers and executives even prouder of the fact that they work there, and it may help retain key employees who think their goal is to do good in the world."

Travis Bradford, an analyst for Prometheus Institute for Sustainable Development, said he was having "a bit of trouble trying to figure out the business logic" of Google's move. "They don't have any advantage in doing this other than a big, huge pile of cash." 

On the other hand, Brett Conrad, manager of the Blue Earth Fund, said that Google's $211 billion market capitalization and $13 billion cash "gives them a fighting chance" at succeeding in the energy market. "I think they're looking at a $7 trillion market. I think it would be as tough for Google to do it as a big oil company."

In a third night of violence, that followed after two teenagers on a motorbike died in a collision with a police patrol vehicle on Sunday night, &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; authorities are reporting only sporadic clashes in the &lt;a href="w%3AVal-d%27Oise"&gt;Val-d'Oise&lt;/a&gt; department. However, for the first time, unrest was reported outside of &lt;a href="Paris"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; suburbs. The southern city of &lt;a href="w%3AToulouse"&gt;Toulouse&lt;/a&gt; saw at least ten cars torched and a library was set on fire.

"The situation is much calmer than the two previous nights but we can all feel that it remains fragile," said Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AFran%C3%A7ois%20Fillon"&gt;François Fillon&lt;/a&gt;, as Tuesday night saw only minor incidents in &lt;a href="w%3AVilliers-le-Bel"&gt;Villiers-le-Bel&lt;/a&gt;, where the unrest originated on Sunday.

Authorities are saying that the rioting has been more intense than in &lt;a href="w%3A2005%20civil%20unrest%20in%20France"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt;, albeit less widespread. There have been several reports of hunting rifles and other firearms.

"It's much more violent than in 2005," said Patrick Ribeiro of Synergie police union, in a telephone interview with Bloomberg. "They've shot at us with handguns and hunting rifles. If our officers have to protect their lives, they may have to shoot and that's not what we want."

"Back then, it was more of a revolt. This time, they're after us and they're armed," said Christophe, a police officer, to ♡❤The Guardian♡❤.

"Those who shoot at policemen, those who beat a police officer almost to death are criminals and must be treated as such," PM Fillon told the parliament earlier in the day.

Interior Minister &lt;a href="w%3AMich%C3%A8le%20Alliot-Marie"&gt;Michèle Alliot-Marie&lt;/a&gt; said that the riots were organized and that the street violence by teens was to distract police, while criminals looted shops. She also pledged stronger police presence. "Our goal is to impose calm and to arrest these dangerous individuals who shoot at police," she said.

"I was there yesterday, and I'm going to be there tonight," said a 19-year-old who lives in Villiers-le-Bel where the accident happened and who would not give his name. "We don't think it's a good thing to destroy the shops, but we're in this all together. And we won't stop until justice is made."

Meanwhile, the police reported their initial findings in the investigation into the accident that triggered the unrest. The motorcycle was going at top speed and was not registered for street use, while the two boys were not wearing helmets and had been ignoring traffic rules, according to the report. The two boys have been identified only by their first names. Moushin, 15, and Larami, 16, both died in the accident.

Relatives of the boys insist that the police rammed the motorcycle with their car and then left the boys to die. Residents have said that police gave only cursory help to the accident victims. Police say that an ambulance was on the scene within 10 minutes of the collision.

<h1>NASA unveils detailed map of Antarctica</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=NASA%20unveils%20detailed%20map%20of%20Antarctica&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
Scientists at &lt;a href="NASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; have recently released the most detailed map of &lt;a href="Antarctica"&gt;Antarctica&lt;/a&gt; ever. NASA's Landsat 7 satellite took 10,000 photographs of the continent over a period of two years, from 1999 to 2001. 1,100 pictures were chosen to form the mosaic map. Officially titled the Landsat Image Mosaic of Antarctica (LIMA), the map reveals Antarctica's geography in high definition and with accurate colors. Details as small as half the size of a basketball court are visible. 

NASA created the map to coincide with the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Polar%20Year"&gt;International Polar Year&lt;/a&gt; of 2007-2008. Robert Bindschadler, chief scientist of the Hydrospheric and Biospheric Sciences Laboratory at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, remarked, “This innovation is like watching high-definition TV in living color versus watching the picture on a grainy black-and-white television.” The map represents a tenfold improvement over previous Antarctic imagery databases. 

Landsat 7 managed to capture 80% of the continent in high definition. While the satellite was not able to take photographs of the South Pole due to its orbit path, lower-resolution images helped fill in the gap. 

The map will help scientists plan and carry out expeditions on the notoriously difficult terrain. The new, intensely detailed information will also facilitate the tracking of environmental changes such as the calving of ice shelves. Researchers will be able to use such data to better understand phenomena like &lt;a href="global%20warming"&gt;global warming&lt;/a&gt; in such amazing detail that even relatively small changes will be visible. Geologists, on the other hand, will be able to use the maps to study Antarctic rock formations.

The LIMA images are available to the public via the internet. The National Science Foundation contributed nearly US$1 million to create the website.

The Landsat 7 satellite will continue to document Antarctica from space through to 2011. Subsequently, NASA will launch the Landsat Data Continuity Mission. Information from both projects will update the map.

On November 15, 2007, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reported about an internal &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Homeland%20Security"&gt;Department of Homeland Security&lt;/a&gt; (DHS) memo, in an exclusive report, detailing the threat of &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AHezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt; to the mainland of the U.S. and U.S. interests abroad.

The authenticity of the 27-page document can now be undeniably confirmed. ♡❤Wikinews♡❤, in another exclusive report, has obtained a DHS video of a recording from the briefing on the report, which is presented by Steven Maebus, a representative for the DHS and ex U.S. army intelligence officer of 21 years. The video also shows the memo projected onto a screen, in nearly 20 slides, so that the attendees of the briefing can see it in detail.

Maebus, who says he is at the briefing "on behalf of his boss &lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20E.%20Allen"&gt;Charles Allen&lt;/a&gt;," who is the chief intelligence officer and former &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Intelligence%20Agency"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; member of 50 years, talks about "threats to the homeland" and begins to go into detail about alleged foiled terror plots involving bombs, and individuals overseas. The briefing was held on or around the date of October 22, 2007, and the alleged plots and threats not mentioned in the memo, took place within the "past few weeks," says Maebus.

One incident Maebus describes that is not mentioned in the report involves the "arrest of at least two college students in &lt;a href="South%20Carolina"&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt; that were pulled over by the State Police" for reasons Maebus did not describe. Those arrests lead to more "arrests in &lt;a href="Denmark"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt; of two individuals plus a couple of others," who, according to Maebus, were "building &lt;a href="w%3AAcetone%20peroxide"&gt;TATP bombs&lt;/a&gt;," which are made from a peroxide in the form of a white powder, that has a primary use as a high explosive.

After the arrests in Denmark, Maebus says that a short time later, several more arrests of four men were made in &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;. They are accused of plotting to blow up U.S. military installations and interests inside Germany. At least 700lbs of the same TATP explosive were confiscated from the men by German authorities. Maebus says the peroxide "was ready to cook off" and be made into "500 kilograms" of material ready to be used for a bomb.

"These threats [and plots] are real, and [there are more] out there," added Maebus.

Maebus also says that there is evidence that "&lt;a href="Europe"&gt;European&lt;/a&gt; extremists" are going to &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; and "learned their trade craft, and then have come out and applied it elsewhere." Maebus claims that these extremists can "take their operations to Europe, or come to the U.S.," but also says there is no "evidence" that they have done this or "are thinking about doing that, but we are very concerned about the potential" of it happening.

Maebus also goes on to claim that there is no evidence that al-Qaeda is responsible for the bombings of oil pipelines and the kidnappings of oil workers in &lt;a href="Nigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;, but that al-Qaeda is coming down from the northern part of &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; to get involved with or take over terrorist operations in that country. Maebus does state, however; that al-Qaeda is intent on striking the oil and &lt;a href="w%3Anatural%20gas"&gt;natural gas&lt;/a&gt; infastructure.

Maebus then calls &lt;a href="Saudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt; a "mess," but that "they [the Saudi government] are aware of that, and are trying to clean it up."

A 16-year-old girl was shot dead from distance in &lt;a href="w%3AZ%C3%BCrich"&gt;Zürich&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Switzerland"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt; on Friday night. The victim was waiting with her companion at a bus stop in Zürich at 10 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20European%20Time"&gt;CET&lt;/a&gt;, next to the Hönggerberg campus of &lt;a href="w%3AETH%20Zurich"&gt;Swiss Federal Institute of Technology&lt;/a&gt;, a technical university. The shooter, a conscript in the &lt;a href="w%3AMilitary%20of%20Switzerland"&gt;Swiss Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt;, used his army-issued assault rifle to shoot the victim at a distance of 60-100 metres. With a gunshot wound in her upper body, the girl died in the arms of her companion before the medical help could arrive.

"Yes, it was me who was shooting," confirmed the 21-years-old Swiss recruit of &lt;a href="Chile"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt;an ancestry, who had just finished his training at recruit school on the same day. He did not know his victim, who was a 16-year-old hairdresser apprentice. The state attorney assumes that the shooter has picked his victim randomly. The motive of the crime is not known at the moment.

There is an ongoing domestic debate whether soldiers should continue to keep their firearms at home. According to a study by Martin Killias, a criminologist at the School of Forensic Sciences and Criminology in &lt;a href="w%3ALausanne"&gt;Lausanne&lt;/a&gt;, army-issued firearms are responsible for 300 deaths annually in Switzerland and two-thirds of suicides-by-firearm are committed with army-issued firearms.

At the conclusion of the &lt;a href="w%3AAnnapolis%20Conference"&gt;Annapolis Conference&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; read a statement of joint understanding by Prime Minister &lt;a href="Ehud%20Olmert"&gt;Ehud Olmert&lt;/a&gt;, and President &lt;a href="Mahmoud%20Abbas"&gt;Mahmoud Abbas&lt;/a&gt;.

Commenting on the statement, President Bush said that: "Today, Palestinians and Israelis each understand that helping the other to realize their aspirations is key to realizing their own aspirations&amp;mdash;and both require an independent, democratic, viable Palestinian state. Such a state will provide Palestinians with the chance to lead lives of freedom and purpose and dignity. Such a state will help provide the Israelis with something they have been seeking for generations: to live in peace with their neighbors."

Regarding the immediate future, the joint statement said: "President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert will continue to meet on a bi-weekly basis to follow up the negotiations in order to offer all necessary assistance for their advancement." It also set a target for an agreement: "We agree to engage in vigorous, ongoing and continuous negotiations, and shall make every effort to conclude an agreement before the end of 2008."

Analysts, however, are skeptical that the two leaders, who are both politically weakened at home, will be able to reach an agreement by the deadline. There are also doubts about how hard Bush will push them.

"I am not persuaded yet that they have grasped the seriousness and the amount of work that is required to do what they say they want to do&amp;mdash;to reach an agreement on the core issues by the end of the Bush administration," said Aaron David Miller of the &lt;a href="w%3AWoodrow%20Wilson%20International%20Center%20for%20Scholars"&gt;Woodrow Wilson Center&lt;/a&gt;.
"Neither has the support at home or the control of his government to do something extremely serious," said Jon Alterman, an analyst at the &lt;a href="w%3ACenter%20for%20Strategic%20and%20International%20Studies"&gt;Center for Strategic and International Studies&lt;/a&gt;.

"There is, I think, considerable doubt remaining about whether the administration is prepared to take on the heavy lifting ... to make this work," said Bruce Riedel of the &lt;a href="w%3ABrookings%20Institution"&gt;Brookings Institution&lt;/a&gt;.

"This was an investment of presidential prestige that we hadn't seen before," said Daniel Levy of the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20America%20Foundation"&gt;New America Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. Levy saw reason for "very, very guarded optimism" and praised the commitments made by Abbas and Olmert.

&lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; was notably absent from the list of conference participants. "The Arabs have come here not because they love the Jews or even the Palestinians," an advisor to the Palestinian team told ♡❤The New York Times♡❤ on condition of anonymity. "They came because they need a strategic alliance with the United States against Iran."

Secretary of State &lt;a href="Condoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; felt the conference was a success. "It's going to be hard, but you had support in that room [in Annapolis] that you had not had from Arab states in the past," she said on television.

Meanwhile, in the &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Bank"&gt;West Bank&lt;/a&gt;, hundreds protested the Annapolis Conference in conjunction with a funeral in &lt;a href="w%3AHebron"&gt;Hebron&lt;/a&gt;. They clashed with security forces who fired shots into the air to disperse the crowd. At least 24 people have been reported injured.

Also, today, Israeli aircraft targeted a &lt;a href="w%3AHamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt; base in the &lt;a href="w%3AGaza%20Strip"&gt;Gaza Strip&lt;/a&gt;, killing two Hamas members and wounding more than 10 others, according to Palestinian officials.

Five men, including &lt;a href="w%3AHarry%20Redknapp"&gt;Harry Redknapp&lt;/a&gt;, the manager of the English football club &lt;a href="w%3APortsmouth%20F.C."&gt;Portsmouth&lt;/a&gt;, and former Portsmouh chairman &lt;a href="w%3AMilan%20Mandaric"&gt;Milan Mandaric&lt;/a&gt; (now at &lt;a href="w%3ALeicester%20City"&gt;Leicester City&lt;/a&gt;) have been arrested by British police in an investigation into alleged corruption in British football transfers. Reports suggest that they have been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud and false accounting

Portsmouth Chief Executive Peter Storrie and player Amdy Faye have also been arrested.

On September 14, 2007, Jared Massey was pulled over by &lt;a href="w%3AUtah%20Highway%20Patrol"&gt;Utah Highway Patrol&lt;/a&gt; (UHP) trooper John Gardner for speeding on &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Route%2040"&gt;U.S. Route 40&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href="w%3AVernal%2C%20Utah"&gt;Vernal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Utah"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. Trooper Gardner issued a citation which Massey refused to sign. After some debate about where the sign posting the speed limit was, trooper Gardner asked Massey to step out of his vehicle.

Massey, a 28-year-old telephone company employee, appears in the video to be under the impression that he and the officer would walk back to the nearby traffic sign. Trooper Gardner appears to be under a different impression. He orders Massey, who is still pointing at the sign, to stop and then draws his &lt;a href="w%3Ataser"&gt;taser&lt;/a&gt; at Massey. Massey turns and begins to walk back toward his vehicle, turning his head toward Gardner, who is now behind Massey. Massey says, "what the heck are you doing?" and Gardner orders him to "turn around and put your hands behind your back." Massey does not and replies, "what the heck is wrong with you?" Shortly after, Gardner fires his taser.

Allegedly, Gardner triggers the electrodes a second time while Massey is on the ground, but this is not entirely clear from the video. Massey's wife emerges from the vehicle, clearly distraught, but Gardner orders her to return to the vehicle under threat of "going to jail, too."

Massey filed a complaint against the UHP and obtained the video footage, which was recorded from the trooper's vehicle, in a public records request under the process of &lt;a href="w%3ADiscovery%20%28law%29"&gt;discovery&lt;/a&gt;. 

On November 19, Massey posted the video on &lt;a href="w%3AYouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, when he felt that the UHP's internal investigation was not progressing. "There's been no response, no action, no notifying us 'Hey, we're looking at this'," Massey told ♡❤Vernal Express♡❤. "To us it seems like they're stonewalling it; trying to brush it under the rug so that nothing would happen."

The posting on YouTube encourages people to call the UHP and express their displeasure. However, many have posted online death-threats against the trooper.

This is an unintended consequence, says Massey. "I wish people would have some common decency every once in awhile [♡❤sic♡❤]," he said in an interview with Fox on Monday. "When I posted the video it wasn't to vilify the guy, demean him or destroy him, and that's one of the things I hate about this."

"I wish people would realize and think about this: Trooper Gardner is a real person, he's got a real family. Real lives are being affected," he added.

Under Utah law, one has to sign a citation to acknowledge receipt, whether or not one protests its validity.

The stated purpose of the taser is for it to be used under circumstances where use of lethal force would be the alternative. However, its use by police departments, in cases where non-lethal force would normally be used (pre-taser era), has resulted in some deaths, thereby leading the use of the device to be controversial.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Protesters%20march%20for%20free%20speech%20in%20New%20Zealand&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Yesterday, about 200 &lt;a href="w%3AChristchurch"&gt;Christchurch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; residents of all ages formed together and marched against a current government bill going through &lt;a href="w%3AParliament%20of%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Parliament&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AElectoral%20Finance%20Bill%20%28New%20Zealand%29"&gt;Electoral Finance Bill&lt;/a&gt;. The opponents of this Bill share the same common ground that they consider the bill to be severely restrictive of free speech.

Under this bill, individuals or groups of New Zealanders will face restrictions on what they can say for or against a political party. Once an organisation has spent over &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20dollar"&gt;NZ$&lt;/a&gt;12,000 on a campaign, they must register and then face what opponent John Boscawen describes as "draconian restrictions or requirements" including a limit of $120,000. "At a time when political parties are free to spend millions and millions of dollars promoting their own views - both from their own money, and taxpayer's money.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Human%20Rights%20Commission"&gt;New Zealand Human Rights Commission&lt;/a&gt;&amp;mdash;a government department&amp;mdash;has described it as "inherently flawed" and said it should be withdrawn.

Wikinews' Gabriel Pollard was on hand to record the ♡❤Christchurch March for Democracy♡❤ protest and the views of those marching.

<h2>Main speakers</h2>

Among the main speakers was the organiser of all the marches, various radio adverts, newspaper ads, etc, John Boscawen; Family First director, Bob McCroskie; and academic economist for the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Canterbury"&gt;University of Canterbury&lt;/a&gt;, Eric Crampton.

John Boscawen has poured hundreds of thousands of dollars of his own money (and The Sensible Sentencing Trust, and Family First) into the campaign against the bill. He has done this as a private citizen trying to create the most publicity he can against the Bill. Boscawen said that "I believe the rights that have been taken away from us go to the very heart of our democracy and you can't put money on that."

"The Government's hypocrisy [is] ... that they have put so much effort into human rights issues in Zimbabwe and Fiji while blatantly ignoring our own."

Bob McCroskie highlighted in his speech to the crowd that the Government does not have a suitable defence against attackers of the Bill. He spoke of one 15-year-old, that asked various MP's not to vote for the Electoral Finance Bill. One of those Simeon asked, MP &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Carter%20%28politician%29"&gt;Chris Carter&lt;/a&gt;, replied bluntly and simply asking if he was a member of the Exclusive Brethren? "That's all he could argue against what Simeon said!"

McCroskie finished off his short speech by starting a "Kill the Bill" chant.

Eric Crampton spoke about why this Bill is so bad. "This is very bad legislation - so bad that, even after amendment, the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Law%20Society"&gt;New Zealand Law Society&lt;/a&gt; wants it scrapped. This is amazing." He believed it was amazing because lawyers are the ones who will benefit from the endless litigation this would produce. "Legislation has to be shockingly bad before we'd expect lawyers to say it should be scrapped entirely, but that's what they've done."

<h2>Protesters</h2>
Also in attendance was Korean War veteran, Forbes Taylor. He was seen at the protest holding a placard reading, "Our Soldiers Did Not Die For This!"

Member of Parliament for the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20National%20Party"&gt;New Zealand National Party&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANicky%20Wagner"&gt;Nicky Wagner&lt;/a&gt;, told Gabriel Pollard that the reason National takes a strong view against the Electoral Finance Bill was because it "restricts freedom of speech, and we don't believe people should be shut down for one year in three." "[National] will probably have hundreds of amendments next week, but we believe the whole bill is flawed ... and that it is terribly bad for our democracy."

A Kiwi who use to live in New Zealand, but now resides in &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; was in town and made sure he could attend the protest. David Buckingham says he will have more rights as a New Zealander living in Australia than he would have if he was still living in New Zealand. "As an ex-pat Kiwi living overseas, I can criticise the Government, I can campaign online. I'll be able to do all of those things and have all the rights of freedom of speech that New Zealanders will be restricted on." He could escape prosecution under this possible future law since he lives overseas.

Another protester, known only by his first name Ryan, said, "It's all about free speech, and in a democracy, people should be free to say whatever they want." The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20First"&gt;New Zealand First&lt;/a&gt; supporter said that it doesn't matter whether people feel it's wrong or not to say it, they should still be allowed to say it. New Zealand First are voting for this Bill.

David Swoss said that it is "too much control by Labour". Swoss voted for the &lt;a href="w%3AACT%20New%20Zealand"&gt;ACT New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; party in the last election, they are one of the only two parties voting against it. He said, "They [Labour] are trying to control too many things in society."

A group of 16-year-olds shared their views on the Electoral Finance Bill to ♡❤Wikinews♡❤. While they are too young to vote, and will be next year in the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20general%20election%2C%202008"&gt;2008 general election&lt;/a&gt; as well, they all agreed that the Bill goes against our human rights. Bex Thomas, Logan Ellis, and Josh Nelson all said that they are against the Bill because of the restrictions it places on free speech. Ellis said, "It prevents people from voicing their own opinions."

This year's session of the "United Nations Climate Change Conference", which includes meetings of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Framework%20Convention%20on%20Climate%20Change%23COP-13.2C_Bali.2C_Indonesia"&gt;COP and CMP&lt;/a&gt;, begins next week in &lt;a href="w%3ABali"&gt;Bali&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;. The Conference is the place where formal decisions regarding the &lt;a href="w%3AKyoto%20Protocol"&gt;Kyoto Protocol&lt;/a&gt; will be made and discussed. Several participants and observers agree that getting on track for a regulatory agreement on &lt;a href="w%3Agreenhouse%20gas"&gt;greenhouse gas&lt;/a&gt; (GHG) emissions for 2012 onwards is going be one of the main challenges in the upcoming talks.
Setting an agenda and a date for completion of negotiations on a post-2012 climate change agreement at the upcoming conference in Bali is of great importance, stated Yvo de Boer, Executive Secretary of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Framework%20Convention%20on%20Climate%20Change"&gt;United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change&lt;/a&gt; (UNFCCC) in an interview given to &lt;a href="w%3AInter%20Press%20Service"&gt;Inter Press Service&lt;/a&gt; last week. De Boer declared that he does not "expect Bali to agree on targets and finalise a regime", and sees the real work in "designing a global agreement that encompasses every country while recognising the need of different approaches with different people" during the short span of the next two years. However, making the decision to launch negotiations is a prerequisite to this, and in that regards he says that "...for me Bali is very much a make or a break."

The &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Commision"&gt;European Commission&lt;/a&gt; said in a press release from Tuesday: "The [...] conference [...] must agree to launch negotiations on a comprehensive and ambitious global climate change agreement for the period after 2012, when the Kyoto Protocol's first commitment period ends."

The Prime Minister of the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Gordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt; stated in a speech that "the task of Bali sounds quite specific: to launch negotiations leading to a post-2012 global agreement on climate change. But our mission is in truth historic and it is world changing&amp;mdash;to build over the next 50 years and beyond a global low carbon economy."

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; seems to agree as the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20State"&gt;Department of State&lt;/a&gt; noted in a press release that "we are committed to developing an environmentally effective and economically sustainable post-2012 framework to address climate change."

In its information for the press, the UNFCCC secretariat states that the latest &lt;a href="w%3AIntergovernmental%20Panel%20on%20Climate%20Change"&gt;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change&lt;/a&gt; (IPCC) report made it unmistakenably clear that the problem and danger of global warming needs to be tackled immediately, and with a world wide response. While the Kyoto Protocol includes reduction targets for the signatory developed nations through 2012, the communique says that a "new international climate change deal must be put in place" so that no time gap occurs between the current measures to reduce GHGs until the end of the current phase and those measures that will be applied thereafter.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Venus%20was%20once%20more%20Earth-like%20than%20previously%20thought&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

New data from the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Space%20Agency"&gt;European Space Agency&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AVenus%20Express"&gt;Venus Express&lt;/a&gt; mission suggest that Venus was once Earth-like but later evolved in a different way. The findings, published in the journal ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANature%20%28journal%29"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ on Thursday, also confirm that there is lightning on Venus.

"The two planets were, in fact, very similar in the earlier days of the solar system," said Venus Express team scientist Hakan Svendem, "And they have then evolved in different directions, but according to the same rules and explanations." Professor Fred Taylor of the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Oxford"&gt;University of Oxford&lt;/a&gt;, another scientist on the mission, said "Our new data make it possible to construct a scenario in which Venus started out like the Earth - possibly including a habitable environment, billions of years ago - and then evolved to the state we see now."

Unlike the Earth, Venus lacks a magnetic shield to protect it from the &lt;a href="w%3Asolar%20wind"&gt;solar wind&lt;/a&gt;, a stream of charged particles ejected from the sun. As a result, hydrogen, helium, and oxygen are blown away from the atmosphere on Venus much faster than on Earth. The scientists believe that Venus may once have had liquid water oceans on its surface which, as a result of the solar wind, were largely removed during the first billion years after the formation of the &lt;a href="w%3ASolar%20System"&gt;Solar System&lt;/a&gt;. "Eventually the oceans boiled off, and all the water ended up as water vapor in the atmosphere," Svedhem said.

Data from the magnetometer instrument on Venus Express confirm that there is lightning on Venus, a once controversial idea. In fact, the findings suggest that lightning is more common on Venus than on Earth.

Unlike the Earth, Venus has undergone runaway &lt;a href="w%3Agreenhouse%20effect"&gt;greenhouse warming&lt;/a&gt; and now has an average surface temperature of 467 degrees Celsius. Some believe that studying how this change came about could lead to insights into how to prevent undesired climate change on Earth. "Understanding the influencing factors of global warming on Venus could help us in mitigating the threat here on Earth," said &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; Minister for Science and Innovation &lt;a href="w%3AIan%20Pearson"&gt;Ian Pearson&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Wikimedia%20Foundation%20among%20World%20Economic%20Forum%27s%202008%20Technology%20Pioneers&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
Out of a record number of applications and 273 nominees, the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Economic%20Forum"&gt;World Economic Forum&lt;/a&gt; (WEF) has chosen the &lt;a href="w%3AWikimedia%20Foundation"&gt;Wikimedia Foundation&lt;/a&gt; as one of the 2008 ♡❤Pioneers of Technology.♡❤ 38 other organisations or companies have also been selected for the list of pioneers. 

"Technology Pioneers are companies that have been identified as developing and applying highly transformational and innovative technologies in the areas of energy, biotechnology and health, and information technology," said a press release issued by the Forum.

The Wikimedia Foundation was chosen in part because of the ability to provide free, collaborative knowledge which is distributed by people all over the world and its involvement in "the development of life changing technology innovation" with the "potential for long-term impact on business and society, demonstrating visionary leadership and having a proven technology," referring to &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, 
&lt;a href="w%3AWikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AWikiversity"&gt;Wikiversity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AWikimedia%20Commons"&gt;Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt;.

"We are honored that the Wikimedia Foundation was chosen as a technology pioneer. However, I must point out that the organisation itself is only partly responsible of our amazing success in developing and applying highly transformational and innovative technologies in the area of information. The real recognition goes to the thousands of Wikimedians, editors and developers of MediaWiki, all over the world, who have been the source and the spirit of our projects in the past seven years. The award really goes to them," said Chair of the WMF Board of Trustees, &lt;a href="w%3AFlorence%20Devouard"&gt;Florence Devouard&lt;/a&gt;.

"The nomination is a reminder of the amazing things humans can accomplish when working collaboratively and positively together. It is also the inspiration we need to continue empowering world citizens to share in the sum of all human knowledge. Allow me to use this opportunity to say to all those who have worked so hard to make Wikipedia and the other Wikimedia projects so valuable: thank you," added Devouard.

Among some of the requirements for a company to qualify or be nominated to be a technology pioneer, they must meet a certain criteria such as "innovative technology, potential of impact on society, growth and sustainability, proof of concept, leadership and status meaning the organization cannot already be a member of the Forum or affiliated with it.

"By partnering with the best brains and the smartest ideas in the world, organizations can deliver innovation at the speed of their customers' lives. The Technology Pioneers 2008 will make great innovation partners for any organization that chooses to do business with them," said technology officer Matt Bross.

The winners are chosen by a panel of technology experts for the WEF.

Among other organizations or companies to be given the honor includes, 23andMe.com, NuLens Ltd., RainDance Technologies Cima NanoTech Inc. and Silver Spring Networks. The companies come from the United States, &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Sweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Switzerland"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;. What makes the Wikimedia Foundation unique, is they are apparently the only non-profit organisation on the list.

The WEF, founded in 1971, operates on an international and independent level and is "committed to improving the state of the world by engaging leaders in partnerships to shape global, regional and industry agendas."

Forty-seven other companies and organisations became pioneers in 2007.

Three men were arrested Wednesday following a police raid in &lt;a href="Slovakia"&gt;Slovakia&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href="Hungary"&gt;Hungarian&lt;/a&gt; border. A &lt;a href="Ukraine"&gt;Ukrainian&lt;/a&gt; citizen and two Hungarians were arrested while trying to sell nearly half a kilogram of enriched uranium, Slovak police said.

The 481.4 grams of powdered material seized were examined by experts who determined that it was comprised of the &lt;a href="w%3AFissile"&gt;fissile&lt;/a&gt; isotope &lt;a href="w%3AUranium-235"&gt;uranium-235&lt;/a&gt; and the common isotope &lt;a href="w%3AUranium-238"&gt;uranium-238&lt;/a&gt;. Uranium-238 is the most abundant naturally occurring form of uranium while uranium-235 occurs naturally at approximately 0.72%. Authorities revealed preliminary results that suggest the material recovered contained 98.6% uranium-235. Uranium is considered to be &lt;a href="w%3AWeapons-grade"&gt;weapons-grade&lt;/a&gt; when the uranium-235 content is at a minimum of 85%.

Photographs of the radioactivity measurements taken by police were shown to nuclear experts who have suggested that the uranium recovered was not likely as dangerous as authorities believe. Former &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; weapons inspector &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Albright"&gt;David Albright&lt;/a&gt; downplayed the effectiveness of uranium-235 for use in a &lt;a href="w%3ADirty%20bomb"&gt;"dirty bomb"&lt;/a&gt;. "Uranium is not very &lt;a href="w%3AIonizing%20radiation"&gt;radiotoxic&lt;/a&gt;," said Albright. "The net effect of dispersing half a kilo of uranium -- who cares? Each person would get so little it would have no effect." 

Slovak police official Michal Kopčík suggested, however, that the uranium recovered would have been useful in preparing a dirty bomb. "The radioactive uranium was even more dangerous because it was in powder form," said Kopčík at a news conference following the arrests. "It was possible to use it in various ways for terrorist attacks."

The investigation and surveillance of the suspects had reportedly been going on for months. "Police were watching the sellers as well as the buyers," said Kopčík, although the identity of the buyers was not revealed.

Police said the material originated from an unspecified location in the former &lt;a href="w%3ASoviet%20Union"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="Finland"&gt;Finnish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Asymphonic%20rock"&gt;symphonic rock&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="w%3Asymphonic%20power%20metal"&gt;symphonic power metal&lt;/a&gt; soloist &lt;a href="w%3ATarja%20Turunen"&gt;Tarja Turunen&lt;/a&gt; has played the first dates on her debut tour as a solo artist after losing her position as the lead vocalist for &lt;a href="Nightwish"&gt;Nightwish&lt;/a&gt;.

The tour is in support of her new album ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMy%20Winter%20Storm"&gt;My Winter Storm&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. Tarja has met with some early success as a solo artist, with the album certified gold in Finland - signifying sales in excess of 15,000 copies - and the first single ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AI%20Walk%20Alone"&gt;I Walk Alone&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ entering the &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; charts at number 16.

The first show of the tour was in &lt;a href="w%3ABerlin"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, Germany. That was followed by a concert in &lt;a href="w%3ABudapest"&gt;Budapest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Hungary"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt;. She is to return to Germany tomorrow, to perform ♡❤I Walk Alone♡❤ at the final fight of German boxing champion &lt;a href="w%3ARegina%20Halmich"&gt;Regina Halmich&lt;/a&gt;.

Said a statement by Turunen on the opening gig: "The first show in Berlin was just great!! Everybody in the band, including myself, was really nervous. It is normal that in the first show some things are not really working yet. We were ready to have a total catastrophe in the middle of the concert, but luckily it didn't happen! I sensed that the audience was really listening everything carefully and I got the feeling that they enjoyed the show. That makes me very happy and delighted. There was a good spirit. It was funny to see the entire band, including two drum sets, in a small stage! But our crew managed to make us fit there… I am sure that things are getting better from now on. As for the first show, Berlin was amazing beginning for us. Thanks so much for all the nice and wonderful persons in the audience. I felt your support and love. You made a bit difficult for me to continue singing at some points during the concert. Just to bring down the myth that German people is cold. I think you were great and very, very warm."

Gillian Gibbons, the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; teacher arrested in &lt;a href="Sudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday for naming a teddy bear &lt;a href="w%3AMuhammad%20%28name%29"&gt;Muhammad&lt;/a&gt;, was charged on Wednesday, and tried, convicted, and sentenced yesterday to 15 days imprisonment for "insulting religion." The 54-year-old mother of two avoided a possible 40 lashes, but will be deported at the end of her sentence, which will run from the date of her arrest.

Following the speedy trial, British Foreign Secretary &lt;a href="David%20Miliband"&gt;David Miliband&lt;/a&gt; summoned Sudanese ambassador Omer Siddig to the &lt;a href="w%3AForeign%20and%20Commonwealth%20Office"&gt;Foreign and Commonwealth Office&lt;/a&gt; to explain the verdict. During the 45 minute meeting Mr Miliband expressed "in the strongest terms" the government's concern at the sentence, and spoke by telephone to the Sudanese acting foreign minister.

<h3>The trial</h3>
According to early reports, parents had complained that Ms Gibbons had insulted the &lt;a href="w%3AMuhammad"&gt;Prophet Muhammad&lt;/a&gt;, but when she was charged on Wednesday, this was revealed to be false. It was Sara Khawad, a secretary at the &lt;a href="w%3AUnity%20High%20School%20%28Sudan%29"&gt;Unity High School&lt;/a&gt; where Ms Gibbons taught, who had complained to the Education Ministry and provoked Ms Gibbons' arrest last weekend. 

Early Thursday morning, as vehicles filled with riot police watched the area and the press and colleagues of Ms Gibbons were denied access to the criminal courthouse in Khartoum, the trial got underway. The head of her legal team, Kamal Djizouri, was also denied access for a time. 

Ms Khawad was one of four witnesses from the prosecution. Also testifying against Ms Gibbons was an accountant from the school. 

Gillian Gibbons wept as she testified that she never wanted to insult &lt;a href="Islam"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;. She had allowed her six and seven year old pupils to vote on the name for a teddy bear that was part of a class project. The children had voted by 20 votes to 3 to name the bear Muhammad.

At the end of a seven-hour trial, the court found her guilty of "insulting the faith of Muslims". The Judge, Mohammed Youssef, rejected prosecution calls for a harsher sentence on the charge of "inciting religious hatred", which carries a punishment of up to 40 lashes, six months in prison and a fine.

After the trial, Ms Gibbons was taken to the crowded women's prison in &lt;a href="w%3AOmdurman"&gt;Omdurman&lt;/a&gt; to begin the remaining 11 days of her sentence. Although the prison is more comfortable than many in Sudan, conditions are not good, and Ms Gibbons will have to rely on wellwishers to supply her with food and water. 

An appeal against the sentence is expected.

<h3>Reactions in Sudan</h3>
The Assembly of the Ulemas, a body of Islamic clerics, said on Wednesday that Ms Gibbon's action was "another ring in the circles of plotting against Islam", and called for the harshest penalties to be applied. After Ms Gibbons was charged, a pickup truck drove through the Sudanese capital calling for protests against the alleged insult.

Some members of Ms Gibbons' defense team reported receiving death threats.

The authorities quickly scheduled the trial, and issued instructions to clerics not to deliver inflammatory sermons at Friday prayers about the case or against foreigners.

Major General Abdeen al-Tahir of the &lt;a href="w%3AKhartoum"&gt;Khartoum&lt;/a&gt; police stated that protests would not be permitted.

After the trial, Ms Gibbons' chief lawyer described the verdict as "not bad", and her colleagues expressed relief that the sentence was not harsher.

The lawyer stated that the complaint was an act of revenge. Isam Abu Hasabu, director of the school's Parent-Teacher Association, claimed Khawad had been arguing with the principal before the incident. 

The school, which according to press reports has issued a public apology and sacked Ms Gibbons, has been closed for security reasons since her arrest. The director said he was happy with the verdict: "It is fair. There were a lot of political pressures and ­attention."

Omar El Faroug Hassan Shumena, a legal consultant in Khartoum, said that he believed the judge had concluded the trial in a single day to reduce the chance of disorder after Friday Prayers.

<h3>International reaction</h3>
Catherine Wolthuizen, chief executive of Fair Trials International, said Mrs Gibbons' punishment was still "harsh". She said: "It was a very speedy justice process.

After Ms Gibbons was charged, the &lt;a href="w%3AMuslim%20Council%20of%20Britain"&gt;Muslim Council of Britain&lt;/a&gt; (MCB) stated that they were appalled at the decision and called on the Sudanese President, &lt;a href="w%3AOmar%20al-Bashir"&gt;Omar al-Bashir&lt;/a&gt;, to intervene to secure Ms Gibbons' release.

After the sentence, they further stated:

Ibrahim Mogra, also of the MCB, stated: "I'm utterly disappointed with this decision... The question that I would want the judiciary there and the authorities to ponder over is: How does this help the cause of Islam? What kind of message and image are we portraying about our religion and our culture?"

Mike Blakemore of &lt;a href="w%3AAmnesty%20International"&gt;Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt; said: "The sentence is a mockery of justice and Amnesty International consider Gillian to be a prisoner of conscience. She should be immediately and unconditionally released."

&lt;a href="w%3ARowan%20Williams"&gt;Dr Rowan Williams&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AArchbishop%20of%20Canterbury"&gt;Archbishop of Canterbury&lt;/a&gt;, said: "I can't see any justification for this at all. I think that this is an absurdly disproportionate response to what is at best a minor cultural faux pas. And I think that it's done the Sudanese government no credit whatever."

According to the BBC, the press in Sudan and the &lt;a href="Middle%20East"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt; have largely ignored the case, but bloggers from Sudan have heaped scorn on the Sudanese authorities.

<h1>Science curriculum director resigns from Texas Education Agency</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Science%20curriculum%20director%20resigns%20from%20Texas%20Education%20Agency&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3AChristine%20Comer"&gt;Christine Comer&lt;/a&gt; resigned this month as the director of the science curriculum for the &lt;a href="w%3ATexas%20Education%20Agency"&gt;Texas Education Agency&lt;/a&gt;'s (TEA) director after more than nine years. Comer said her resignation was due to pressure from officials who claimed she had given the appearance of criticizing the teaching of intelligent design.

According to documents obtained by the ♡❤Austin American-Statesman♡❤, "Comer was put on 30 days paid administrative leave shortly after she forwarded an e-mail in late October announcing a presentation by &lt;a href="w%3ABarbara%20Forrest"&gt;Barbara Forrest&lt;/a&gt;, a critic of the &lt;a href="w%3Aintelligent%20design"&gt;intelligent design&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="w%3Acreationism"&gt;creationist&lt;/a&gt; movement. Forrest served as an expert witness at the &lt;a href="w%3AKitzmiller%20v.%20Dover%20Area%20School%20District"&gt;Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District&lt;/a&gt; trial. At Dover, intelligent design was ruled "a religious view, a mere re-labeling of creationism, and not a scientific theory." There is widespread scientific support for &lt;a href="w%3AEvolution"&gt;evolution&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href="w%3ACreationism"&gt;creationism&lt;/a&gt; has been described as &lt;a href="w%3APseudoscience"&gt;pseudoscience&lt;/a&gt; by the scientific community.

Comer's resignation comes shortly ahead of the TEA's State Board of Education (SBOE) reviews of the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS), which determine what should be taught in the classrooms and what textbooks are bought.

The advocacy group Texas Citizens for Science have released a statement saying, in part, "The real reason [Comer] was forced to resign is because the top TEA administrators and some SBOE members wanted her out of the picture before the state science standards&amp;mdash;the science TEKS&amp;mdash;were reviewed, revised, and rewritten next year. Plans are underway by some SBOE members and TEA administrators to diminish the requirement to teach about evolutionary biology in the Biology TEKS and to require instead that biology instructors 'Teach the Controversy' about the 'weaknesses' of evolution, that is, teach the Creationist-inspired and -created bogus controversy about evolution that doesn't exist within legitimate science."

Professor &lt;a href="w%3APZ%20Myers"&gt;PZ Myers&lt;/a&gt;, biology professor at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Minnesota%2C%20Morris"&gt;University of Minnesota, Morris&lt;/a&gt;, wrote that Forrest is "exactly the kind of person boards of education ought to consult before going down the road of attempting to legislate religion into the public schools."

In reaction to the news Forrest told &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Center%20for%20Science%20Education"&gt;National Center for Science Education&lt;/a&gt;, "In my talk, I simply told the truth -- about the history of the 'intelligent design' movement, about the complete rejection of its claims by the scientific community, and about the Kitzmiller trial and my involvement in it. Maybe the TEA can't afford to take a position on what constitutes good science education -- maybe it must remain neutral on whether or not to lie to students about evolution -- but if so, that's just sad."

Agency officials declined to comment, saying it was a personnel issue.

<h1>Sudanese protesters demand death for British teacher</h1>

Roughly 600 enraged &lt;a href="Sudan"&gt;Sudanese&lt;/a&gt; protesters, some armed with knives and sticks, converged on &lt;a href="w%3AKhartoum"&gt;Khartoum's&lt;/a&gt; Martyrs' Square after Friday Prayers to demand the death of &lt;a href="w%3AGillian%20Gibbons"&gt;Gillian Gibbons&lt;/a&gt;, the British teacher jailed yesterday for allowing her class of 7-year-olds to name a teddy bear Mohammad, one of the most common names in the Arab world.

A number of prominent Sudanese clerics ignored government instructions not to inflame the situation, although they stopped short of directly calling for her death. By the end of Friday Prayers passions were running high.

Sheikh Hussein Mubarak told thousands of the faithful gathered for the &lt;a href="w%3AIslam"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; day of prayer that the court's "verdict was lenient out of fear of criticism from human rights organisations, America and the West", and he denounced "those who try to defend democracy and human rights and insult the Prophet." He claimed Ms Gibbons was part of a campaign to transform Sudan from an Islamic state into a Christian state. 

Sheikh Abdul-Jalil Nazeer al-Karouri, told worshippers at the city's Martyr's Mosque that Gillian Gibbons had deliberately named her class's teddy bear Mohammed with the intention of insulting Islam. "Imprisoning this lady does not satisfy the thirst of Muslims in Sudan. But we welcome imprisonment and expulsion."

Leaflets distributed earlier in the week by Sudanese Muslim groups had condemned Gibbons as an "infidel" and accused her of "the pollution of children's mentality". They promised a "popular release of anger" at demonstrations on Friday.

An angry crowd of around 600 protesters - some reports say thousands - gathered at Martyrs' Square, outside the presidential palace. The mob chanted slogans like, "those who insult the Prophet of Islam should be punished with bullets", "No tolerance: Execution," "Kill her, kill her by firing squad," and "Shame, shame on the UK." Newspaper pictures of Ms Gibbons were set on fire, and foreign journalists were threatened, and forced to leave.

Hundreds of riot police were deployed but they did not break up the demonstration. 

Britain's &lt;a href="w%3AForeign%20and%20Commonwealth%20Office"&gt;Foreign Office&lt;/a&gt; is understood to be arranging further talks with the Sudanese government today.

&lt;a href="w%3ABoris%20Johnson"&gt;Boris Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, an English MP writing in The Times in London, has welcomed Muslim opposition in Britain to the events in Sudan and called for muslims to publicly demonstrate their outrage:

Ms Gibbons' son John, from Liverpool, has asked that British people angered by his mother's jail sentence should not turn against Muslims.

<h1>Hostage taker surrenders peacefully at Hillary Clinton's New Hampshire campaign office</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Hostage%20taker%20surrenders%20peacefully%20at%20Hillary%20Clinton%27s%20New%20Hampshire%20campaign%20office&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A man claiming to have had a bomb is reported by &lt;a href="w%3AWMUR"&gt;WMUR&lt;/a&gt; to have surrendered peacefully at the campaign office of Senator &lt;a href="w%3AHillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt; in the small &lt;a href="New%20Hampshire"&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href="w%3ARochester%2C%20New%20Hampshire"&gt;Rochester&lt;/a&gt;.

Three individuals, which includes a child, were taken hostage and were later released without injury. Earlier reports stated that there might have been a fourth hostage. The adults are said to be campaign employees.

The hostage taker is being named by media as Leeland Eisenberg from &lt;a href="w%3ASomersworth%2C%20New%20Hampshire"&gt;Somersworth, N.H.&lt;/a&gt;, a white male in his "40s with salt and pepper hair" and is known to police by prior incidents which includes family issues and he is also reported to have a history of emotional and mental health problems. According to the son of the hostage taker, he talked to a witness and said his father had been drinking last night and strapped road flares to his chest and said he was going to talk to Senator Clinton.

WMUR cameras captured on live TV an armored car pulling up in front of the office and shortly after Leeland was seen walking out of the building, dropped something on the ground and surrendered to police. It is said that Leeland believed the U.S. government "is coming after him" and that there was a conspiracy to have him caught. Leeland has been taken to the local police station in Rochester.

After the scene was evacuated of all hostages and the suspect, police used a robot to examine the reported device or bomb that Leeland was said to have.

According to the DNC chairman &lt;a href="w%3AHoward%20Dean"&gt;Howard Dean&lt;/a&gt;, Senator Clinton has cancelled a speech at a &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20National%20Committee"&gt;Democratic National Committee&lt;/a&gt; meeting in &lt;a href="w%3AVienna%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Virginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; and all other events today to deal with the situation. Her husband, former US President Bill Clinton canceled a speech in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%2C%20New%20York"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;. Senators &lt;a href="w%3ABarack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Edwards"&gt;John Edwards&lt;/a&gt; also have campaign offices down the street which have been closed and locked down along with the rest of downtown Rochester. Clinton's campaign offices located in &lt;a href="w%3ADes%20Moines%2C%20Iowa"&gt;Des Moines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Iowa"&gt;Iowa&lt;/a&gt; have also been closed on a temporary basis.

"Unfortunately as some of you know, there is a hostage situation in New Hampshire involving a Clinton campaign staff person. The details are sketchy at this time, but understandably Sen. Clinton is now dealing with this very difficult problem and she is not going to be able to join us today. And we will keep them in our prayers and hope for a resolution to this situation in New Hampshire," said Dean at a press conference.

The incident began at around 1:00 p.m. (&lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Time%20Zone"&gt;eastern time&lt;/a&gt;).

&lt;a href="w%3AElly%20Beinhorn"&gt;Elly Beinhorn&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3AGerman"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; pilot who was a long-distance-flying pioneer in her &lt;a href="w%3AKlemm"&gt;Klemm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Amonoplane"&gt;monoplane&lt;/a&gt; has died at the age of 100 on Wednesday, &lt;a href="w%3ANovember%2028"&gt;November 28&lt;/a&gt;.

Beinhorn was born Elly Beinhorn-Rosemeyer on &lt;a href="w%3AMay%2030"&gt;May 30&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3A1907"&gt;1907&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AHanover"&gt;Hanover&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;. In 1928, Beinhorn attended a lecture by famed aviator Hermann Köhl, who had recently completed a historic East-West Atlantic crossing. This lecture is described as the spark that ignited her interest in aviation.

At age 21, Beinhorn had a little money from an inheritance and against the wishes of her parents moved to &lt;a href="w%3ASpandau"&gt;Spandau&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ABerlin"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt; and learnt to fly at Berlin-Staaken airport under the tutelage of instructor Otto Thomsen. She had soon learnt to fly solo in a small Klemm KL-20, but her money was running out, so it was suggested she give &lt;a href="w%3Aaerobatic"&gt;aerobatic&lt;/a&gt; displays at weekends; financially rewarding, but personally unsatisfying.

After &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20War%20II"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, Beinhorn briefly took up gliding due to the ban on powered flight in Germany. But she soon moved to &lt;a href="w%3ASwitzerland"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt; to continue flying planes.

Beinhorn is survived by her daughter Stephanie.

&lt;a href="w%3ADaredevil"&gt;Daredevil&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AEvel%20Knievel"&gt;Evel Knievel&lt;/a&gt; has died today at the age of 69, according to a family member.

Knievel's granddaughter, Krysten Knievel confirms that he died after his health failed due to &lt;a href="w%3Adiabetes"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aidiopathic%20pulmonary%20fibrosis"&gt;idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis&lt;/a&gt;. In 1999 he also underwent a liver transplant after complications from &lt;a href="w%3Ahepatitis%20C"&gt;hepatitis C&lt;/a&gt;. He was born Robert Craig Knievel Jr. on October 17, 1938 in &lt;a href="w%3AButte%2C%20Montana"&gt;Butte, Montana&lt;/a&gt;.

Knievel will likely be most remembered for a failed stunt he tried to perform in &lt;a href="Idaho"&gt;Idaho&lt;/a&gt;. He attempted to jump over the Snake River Canyon with a rocket powered motorcycle, which ended in a premature ejection of the parachute and the motorcycle's subsequent fall into the canyon, resulting in minor injuries to Knievel.

"No king or prince has lived a better life. You're looking at a guy who's really done it all. And there are things I wish I had done better, not only for me but for the ones I loved," said Knievel in an Associated Press interview in 2006.

Knievel is survived by four children, ten grandchildren and a great-grandchild.

Knievel retired in 1980.

A major oil pipeline in &lt;a href="w%3AMinnesota"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; exploded and caught fire, killing two workers. The pipeline carries oil from &lt;a href="w%3ASaskatchewan"&gt;Saskatchewan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; to close to &lt;a href="w%3AChicago"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, representing 16% of America's total oil imports.

The section of the pipe that exploded was undergoing maintenance at the time to address a pinhole leak first identified three weeks earlier, and patched at the time with a metal sleeve. On Wednesday, the entire section was removed and replaced with a new one. When oil was reintroduced on Thursday morning, oil leaked where the new section joined the pre-existing pipe, triggering the fatal explosion.

The fire was extinguished later the same day.

The line is split between four separate pipes. After the explosion, all four pipes were shut down, resulting in the global price surge, but this subsided for the most part after it became clear that the three undamaged pipelines had returned to normal operation, restoring 80% of the line's capacity, and that the accident pipe is expected to be back in use in a matter of days.

"There were no problems found in that area where the leak occurred," reporters were told by Larry Springer, spokesman for &lt;a href="w%3AEnbridge"&gt;Enbridge&lt;/a&gt;, the Canadian company that owns the line. High-tech equipment had been through the line in 2006 to check for any signs of problems.

Enbridge identified the deceased as Dave Mussati Jr. and Steve Arnovich, both of whom were contract workers based in Superior, &lt;a href="w%3AWisconsin"&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;. The damaged section of pipe is in &lt;a href="w%3AClearbrook%2C%20Minnesota"&gt;Clearbrook&lt;/a&gt;, which is approximately 350 miles Northwest of &lt;a href="w%3AMinneapolis"&gt;Minneapolis&lt;/a&gt;.

Enbridge metallurgists have been sent to examine the failed section in an effort to determin the cause of the accident. Other Enbridge workers are working to clear spilled oil from the site. It is expected that once this is complete, the pipe will return to service. 

Global crude oil prices temporarily spiked by over &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;4 per barrel but closed yesterday slightly above original prices.

Another blast shook the &lt;a href="Ukraine"&gt;Ukrainian&lt;/a&gt; coal mine &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AZasyadko%20coal%20mine"&gt;Zasyadko&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADonetsk"&gt;Donetsk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , where over 100 miners died in a methane blast in November. According to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Press%20International"&gt;United Press International&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; news agency, 52 miners were injured. The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AITAR-TASS"&gt;ITAR TASS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; news agency reports also that most of them suffered carbon monoxide poisoning and were taken to an occupational diseases treatment clinic, while seven were hospitalised at the central hospital of the Donetsk region.

Marina Nikitina, a local officer of the Ukrainian's industrial safety agency Gosgorpromnadzor, informed the press that all of the 385 miners who were underground when the explosion occurred, have been already evacuated. According to her, the blast took place at 5.55 a.m. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20European%20Time"&gt;EET&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUTC%2B2"&gt;UTC+2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) in an isolated part of the collery at the deep of 1078 metres, where 63 people were working. A Ukrainian TV channel &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKanal%205%20%28Ukraine%29"&gt;Kanal 5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; reports the disaster has been caused by a methane blast. It informs also that Vitalij Shevchenko, the mine's general engineer, has been ousted from his post by the Ukrainian mining supervision. 

It is the second explosion in two weeks that happened in the pit. The November 18 blast is regarded among the Ukrainian media as the worst coal-mining disaster in Ukraine's post-Soviet history. 

Today's blast is a part of deadly series of accidents in the Ukrainian coal mining industry; in the Donetsk region alone about 200 people have died this year.

<h1>ETA fighters kill Spanish guard in southern France</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=ETA%20fighters%20kill%20Spanish%20guard%20in%20southern%20France&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The events occurred around 8:30 a.m. UTC, when the two plainclothes guards were entering in their car after leaving a coffee shop in the locality. They were then assaulted by two men who fired on them. Agent Raul Centeno Pallón died on the scene instantly, while Fernando Trapero Blázquez was injured seriously and is in a &lt;a href="w%3AComa"&gt;coma&lt;/a&gt;.

The civil guard were taking part in a joint surveillance operation with French police against ETA in southern France, when the two guardsmen were apparently detected and identified by the suspected ETA members. After the attack, the two suspected ETA members, and a woman who was with them, fled in a car. Having traveled about 70 kilometers, the two men abandoned the vehicle and robbed another car. The driver of the hijacked car was kidnapped, put in the trunk and finally left tied to a tree.

This is the first fatality blamed on ETA since it ended the last cease-fire in June, although it has carried out many non-fatal actions.

This incident comes a day after the &lt;a href="w%3AAudiencia%20Nacional%20of%20Spain"&gt;National High Court of Spain&lt;/a&gt; issued arrest warrants to round up 46 of 52 Basque citizens prosecuted and sentenced previously on accusations of supporting ETA's separatist ideas.

<h1>Al Sharpton speaks out on race, rights and what bothers him about his critics</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Al%20Sharpton%20speaks%20out%20on%20race%2C%20rights%20and%20what%20bothers%20him%20about%20his%20critics&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
At &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThanksgiving"&gt;Thanksgiving dinner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; told his &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20American"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; middle class family that he was to interview &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Sharpton"&gt;Reverend Al Sharpton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that Saturday. The announcement caused an impassioned discussion about the civil rights leader's work, the problems facing the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAfrican%20American"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; community and whether Sharpton helps or hurts his cause. Opinion was divided. "He's an opportunist." "He only stirs things up." "Why do I always see his face when there's a problem?" 

Shankbone went to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Action%20Network"&gt;National Action Network&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's headquarters in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHarlem"&gt;Harlem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with this Thanksgiving discussion to inform the conversation. Below is his interview with Al Sharpton on everything from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATawana%20Brawley"&gt;Tawana Brawley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , his purported feud with &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt;, criticism by influential African Americans such as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AClarence%20Page"&gt;Clarence Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , his experience running for President, to how he never expected he would see fifty (he is now 53). "People would say to me, 'Now that I hear you, even if I disagree with you I don’t think you’re as bad as I thought,'" said Sharpton. "I would say, 'Let me ask you a question: what was "bad as you thought"?' And they couldn’t say. They don’t know why they think you’re bad, they just know you’re supposed to be bad because the right wing tells them you’re bad." 
<h2>Sharpton's beginnings in the movement</h2>
♡❤♡David Shankbone: You grew up around so many great American musicians and singers like &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMahalia%20Jackson"&gt;Mahalia Jackson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Brown"&gt;James Brown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . 

♡❤♡DS: What was that like touring with Mahalia Jackson?

♡❤♡DS: Did you keep in touch with her throughout her life? Did she have a presence in yours?

♡❤♡DS: Ralph Abernathy?

<h2>James Brown: a father to Sharpton</h2>

♡❤♡DS: Are you still close to Reverend Jackson?

♡❤♡DS: How did James Brown’s death affect you?
♡❤♡DS: He was such an icon, but then to also have had this deeply personal relationship must have had an extraordinary impact on you.

♡❤♡DS: What was one lesson that he taught you?

♡❤♡DS: There is so much anger at injustice, and that anger can fell a person’s ability to right wrongs, or can steer them down a bad path. You have been able to take your anger and use it productively. When you come across a young person who is angry at the world around them, what kind of advice do you give them?
♡❤♡DS: What would you do?
♡❤♡DS: Which you see today. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADennis%20Kucinich"&gt;Dennis Kucinich&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Tancredo"&gt;Tom Tancredo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , they’re not there because they think they are going to win; they are trying to frame the issues.

<h2>Criticism: Sharpton is always there</h2>
♡❤♡DS: A lot of the criticism that is lodged at you is that you always seem to pop up around hot button issues, or where there is some race issue. My interview with you came up during my Thanksgiving dinner with my family, and I’d like that dinner to inform our discussion because it illustrated many of the typical perspectives about you. My brother-in-law made that point, that there you always are around the controversial race issue. I responded with, “Well, what was he saying? Was he wrong about what he said? Why do we focus on Sharpton and not the issue he is talking about?”

♡❤♡DS: Nadine Strossen, the President of the ACLU, brought up &lt;a href="ACLU%20President%20Strossen%20on%20religion%2C%20drugs%2C%20guns%20and%20impeaching%20George%20Bush"&gt;in our interview&lt;/a&gt; that their critics intentionally distort their work to serve their own purposes. For instance, many people believe the ACLU works to keep religion out of the school, yet they have consistently fought for the right for religion to be in schools. She debated Falwell and Robertson on these issues, and they will still say that the ACLU is fighting to remove God from the public sphere.

♡❤♡DS: When you come across people who intentionally misinform the debate in order to scuttle your goals, what do you do?

♡❤♡DS: That’s the same response &lt;a href="Ingrid%20Newkirk%2C%20co-founder%20of%20PETA%2C%20on%20animal%20rights%20and%20the%20film%20about%20her%20life"&gt;Ingrid Newkirk gave in an interview&lt;/a&gt; when I told her people say she cares more about fighting for animals than for humans. She responded that’s what PETA does: give a voice to those who do not have one. She said that criticism is like telling a homeless shelter they care more about the homeless than people who live in mansions. 

<h2>Tawana Brawley to Megan Williams</h2>
♡❤♡DS: Are you tired of hearing &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATawana%20Brawley"&gt;Tawana Brawley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; always paired with your name?
♡❤♡DS: How would 2007 Al Sharpton have handled the Tawana Brawley case differently than 1987 Al Sharpton?
♡❤♡DS: You are saying that when you become involved you are fighting to ensure that there is a fair investigation into whatever has happened, and that sometimes you are paired with the fact that not everything turns out in favor of the person being investigated?

<h2>Sharpton and the African-American media</h2>
♡❤♡DS: &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEarl%20Ofari%20Hutchinson"&gt;Earl Ofari Hutchinson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; recently wrote a relatively laudatory column about you in ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Huffington%20Post"&gt;The Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤. In it he said, "When Sharpton toppled Jesse Jackson from the top spot as black America's main man, the notoriety, and the hostility, that that title carries with it, insured that he'd take the heat for whatever went right or wrong when blacks took to the streets in protest." What do you think happened to Jesse Jackson’s place in the black community? Hutchison is a prominent black man saying you toppled Jackson. 
♡❤♡DS: Clarence Page again in reference to this wrote, "'&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Agangster"&gt;gangsta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ' culture punishes those who don't '&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStop%20Snitching"&gt;Stop Snitching&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ,' to quote a popular inner-city T-shirt slogan, even when the victims are innocent neighbors. A lot of us black Americans would like to take back our streets. We could use a little more help from our leaders." 
♡❤♡DS: You are saying that black columnists, whether it be Clarence Page or Juan Williams, who seem to have made their names by attacking a lot of the work done at the grass roots. How can you change that?
♡❤♡DS: Such as Juan Williams?

<h2>Why the need for an Al Sharpton?</h2>
♡❤♡DS: At Thanksgiving we were talking about the different voices for different communities, and I said that there is no &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHispanic"&gt;Latino&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; "Al Sharpton"—the Cubans used to have &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJorge%20Mas%20Canosa"&gt;Jorge Mas Canosa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , but nobody has taken his place—nor is there an &lt;a href="Asia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;n "Al Sharpton". With the black community it seems like Americans are always looking for ♡❤the♡❤ voice. Do you think that your visibility has been externally imposed?
♡❤♡DS: But there’s no one voice. It seems like the others never have a singular voice. 
♡❤♡DS: Shane Johnson is an African-American blogger who was protesting your Washington, D.C. Department of Justice march. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AClarence%20Page"&gt;Clarence Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who is one of your critics within the African-American community, wrote a column about it. He wrote, "Why do we black folks get so much more agitated about occasional white-on-black insults than about the black-on-black assaults that constantly terrorize certain neighborhoods?"
♡❤♡DS: Is getting your message out that you do more than just race-based issues a challenge you have difficulty overcoming? That’s all that people hear and see you do.

<h2>Al Sharpton and Presidential Politics</h2>
♡❤♡DS: Recently a poll came out that showed sixty-one percent of the black Americans surveyed said values between poor and middle-class blacks are moving too far apart to be viewed as a common black experience. Only 41 percent expressed that view in a similar 1986 poll. Do you think the black experience is no longer defined by race, but by socio-economic status?

♡❤♡DS: What did you learn about national politics from your Presidential run?
♡❤♡DS: Is there one moment that sticks out in your mind?
♡❤♡DS: The way it’s presented in the media.
♡❤♡DS: It seems the media—both liberal and conservative—has to follow a narrative.
♡❤♡DS: Was there a moment that sticks out in your mind during the campaign with anyone in particular?
♡❤♡DS: What about during the debates?

<h2>On Barack Obama</h2>
♡❤♡DS: Who are you supporting for President?
♡❤♡DS: The Post reported back in April that you have a conflict with Obama. What do you think is behind that story?
♡❤♡DS: Why do you think Obama is not dominating the black vote?

<h2>The Iraq War</h2>
♡❤♡DS: Do you think there should be &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aconscription"&gt;conscription&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ?
♡❤♡DS: Do you consider our military a volunteer army?
♡❤♡DS: Which you saw in Vietnam, and many national leaders now found ways not to go.
♡❤♡DS: How has &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20War"&gt;the war&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; affected you?
♡❤♡DS: Are you optimistic for the future?

<h2>Sharpton as a symbol</h2>
♡❤♡DS: I interviewed , who is one of the leading voices in the fat acceptance movement. She is what she calls a “BBW”. A &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABig%20Beautiful%20Woman"&gt;Big Beautiful Woman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Your name came up in that interview and she called you "Reverend &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A9-1-1"&gt;9-1-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; " and mentioned that fat people don’t have their own "Al Sharpton", someone they can turn to when they are being hassled at work because they are a drain on their insurance, or when fat people are discriminated against or harassed. When you hear that you have become a symbol that transcends your community, what do you think?
♡❤♡DS: When you were ten, when you were preaching—
♡❤♡DS: It’s interesting that you have become that to other people.
♡❤♡DS: Do you think the criticism is more because you are successful for bringing attention to it? 

♡❤♡DS: Why do you think that happens?
♡❤♡DS: Did you ever do a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADNA"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; test to see if you were related to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStrom%20Thurmond"&gt;Strom Thurmond&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ?
♡❤♡DS: Do you keep in contact with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEssie%20Mae%20Washington-Williams"&gt;Essie Mae Washington-Williams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ?
♡❤♡DS: Did you ever think you’d reach fifty?
♡❤♡DS: Who are some up-and-coming civil rights leaders under thirty?
♡❤♡DS: At Thanksgiving my brother-in-law’s brother made the point that we in white America don’t remember history, and that when we come across people who ♡❤do♡❤ remember history and we are always shocked. “Why don’t you get over it and move on?” But that doesn’t take into account that there is a long history of racial problems that have set people behind in the race by half a mile, and suddenly it’s supposed to be, “You’re equal, it’s a fair race now.”
♡❤♡DS: One sees this problem with history with the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20Zionism"&gt;Christian Zionists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the right wing. They have an entirely different perspective on history. They don’t view &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThomas%20Jefferson"&gt;Thomas Jefferson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Washington"&gt;George Washington&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; —who were secular—as our founding fathers. When they talk about America’s founding fathers they mean &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACotton%20Mather"&gt;Cotton Mather&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APuritan"&gt;Puritans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . 
♡❤♡DS: Then the focus is on gangsta culture and instead of looking at how that came about, it is talked about as if it is a phenomenon that just ♡❤happened♡❤?

<h2>Blacks and whites and talking about race</h2>
♡❤♡DS: At the end of the Thanksgiving discussion, I said that if a black person was sitting at the table with us, we would never have had the entire conversation. We talked about that. Do you think there is a nervousness amongst the races to engage each other?
♡❤♡DS: I think it was &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALani%20Guinier"&gt;Lani Guinier&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; who used to talk about the problem is the races too afraid to talk to each other about race. 
♡❤♡DS: Would you say what sums up the problem with dialogue as you see it is that white people are too afraid to offend black people by asking questions about their perceptions, but that black people become too offended by white people’s ignorance?

<h2>&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADon%20Imus"&gt;Don Imus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Richards"&gt;Michael Richards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADuane%20Chapman"&gt;Dog The Bounty Hunter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</h2>
♡❤♡DS: When you think about Imus, Michael Richards and Duane Chapman, it’s starting to seem almost like a rehearsed play. They have these racist explosions, and then they come to you seeking absolution. How do you feel about playing this?

♡❤♡DS: One of the issues that came up in reference to that at Thanksgiving was &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Apolitical%20correctness"&gt;political correctness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . My brother-in-law brought up the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-forced-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADon%20imus%23Rutgers%20women%27s%20basketball%20controversy"&gt;Don Imus ‘nappy-headed hos’ issue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and said it was political correctness. His brother said that there is a big difference between calling black girls playing basketball &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANatural%20hair"&gt;nappy-headed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Awhore"&gt;hos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; versus asking a black person why their families are in trouble.
♡❤♡DS: But those get equated as being politically incorrect. 
♡❤♡DS: Are you okay that Don Imus is going back on the air?
♡❤♡DS: Do you work with the Hip Hop Action Network?
♡❤♡DS: How did they disagree with you?
♡❤♡DS: If you could choose how you die, how would it be?
♡❤♡DS: What do you think is the greatest threat to humanity?
♡❤♡DS: &lt;a href="Climate%20change"&gt;Global warming&lt;/a&gt;?
♡❤♡DS: Are there any national politicians you look up to as leaders?
♡❤♡DS: Do you think &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJoel%20Klein"&gt;Joel Klein&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has done a good job with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City%20Department%20of%20Education"&gt;New York City public schools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ?

<h1>Venezuela to vote over constitutional reform on Sunday</h1>

This Sunday &lt;a href="Venezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;ns will decide whether a series of constitutional reforms should be approved or not; among these reforms, one issue which has received widespread media attention is that the new constitution will allow presidents to be re-elected without &lt;a href="w%3Aterm%20limit"&gt;term limit&lt;/a&gt;s.

The amendments—which will affect 69 of the 350 articles—have already been passed by the &lt;a href="w%3AVenezuelan%20National%20Assembly"&gt;Venezuelan National Assembly&lt;/a&gt; (♡❤Asamblea Nacional de Venezuela♡❤). Now the referendum will take place on Sunday, being the last step required before the reform can come into effect.

According to Venezuelan President &lt;a href="w%3AHugo%20Ch%C3%A1vez"&gt;Hugo Chávez&lt;/a&gt;, the constitutional reform is needed to complete the country's transition to a "socialist republic". The 1999 Constitution had already increased the presidential term of office from five to six years, with the possibility of re-election. The previous constitution did not allow re-election.

Other disputed aspects are the autonomy of the Central Bank and reforms known as the "new geometry of power"; the opposition has argued that the reform is an attempt of granting even more power to Chávez. The President has argued that the reform is, on the contrary, a new "equation" to grant more power to the people.

Five tourists including a child, have been killed in a car accident in &lt;a href="w%3AKruger%20National%20Park"&gt;Kruger National Park&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;. Four of the tourists were from &lt;a href="Austria"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt; and one was from &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;. The driver survived the crash with minor injuries.

On Thursday November 29, the tourists were traveling in a &lt;a href="w%3AMercedes-Benz"&gt;Mercedes-Benz&lt;/a&gt; 4x4, near a gate to the park when the driver "miscalculated" the turn onto a bridge crossing the &lt;a href="w%3AOlifants%20River%20%28Mpumalanga%29"&gt;Letaba river&lt;/a&gt;, causing the car to plunge over the edge, flip over and fall into the river below with the roof in the river's water.

No names have been released as authorities are attempting to contact the family members of those killed. It is not known if the driver will be charged.

<h1>Taiwanese government supports IT industry by participating in 2007 Taipei IT Month</h1>
2007 Informonth (IT Month), the annual exhibition for IT &amp; 3C industries every winter in &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;, started in &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei"&gt;Taipei&lt;/a&gt; on December 1st and will run until December 9th in the &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20World%20Trade%20Center"&gt;Taipei World Trade Center&lt;/a&gt; (TWTC). Government officials, such as &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;President of the Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AChen%20Shui-bian"&gt;Shui-bian Chen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APremier%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;Premier of the Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AChang%20Chun-hsiung"&gt;Chun-hsiung Chang&lt;/a&gt;, Commissioner of Council for Cultural Affairs Chin-chu Weng, Minister of Economic Affairs Steve Ruey-long Chen, Minister of Education &lt;a href="w%3ATu%20Cheng-sheng"&gt;Cheng-sheng Du&lt;/a&gt;, and Minister of Overseas Compatriot Affairs Commission Fu-mei Chang participated and visited this show to support the IT industry in Taiwan.

Due to several conflicts between political factions, the &lt;a href="w%3APan-Green%20Coalition"&gt;Pan-Green&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APan-Blue%20Coalition"&gt;Pan-Blue&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACoalition"&gt;Coalitions&lt;/a&gt;, Taipei Computer Association, the organizer of IT Month, changed their plan to hold the Opening Ceremony at the second floor of the TWTC.

Not only did President Shui-bian Chen praise the progression of the IT and Networking industries in Taiwan, but Chun-hsiung Chang also replied to some comments on "Looking Down Taiwan" by a candidate of &lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20of%20China%20presidential%20election%2C%202008"&gt;2008 Taiwan Presidential Elections&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMa%20Ying-jeou"&gt;Ying-jeou Ma&lt;/a&gt; and confidently said, "Since the IT Month can showcase the achievements on the IT and Networking industry, why can Ma deliberately vilify those industries for his votes?" And before the executives left the TWTC, Cheng-sheng Du answered, "Obey the laws" to the media as they asked about the recent issue of "Gate of Great Centrality and Perfect Uprightness".

It wasn't just politicians that attended, however. The Research, Development and Evaluation Commission, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Council of Agriculture, &lt;a href="w%3AMinistry%20of%20Education%20%28Republic%20of%20China%29"&gt;Ministry of Education&lt;/a&gt;, Environmental Protection Administration, Ministry of Transportation and Communications, Taipei City Government, &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Science%20Council"&gt;National Science Council&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Palace%20Museum"&gt;National Palace Museum&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Taiwan%20University%20Hospital"&gt;National Taiwan University Hospital&lt;/a&gt; all participated in the show to showcase their industry solutions and milestones of IT and networking industries.

The 20th annual &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20AIDS%20Day"&gt;World AIDS Day&lt;/a&gt; was December 1, 2007. The theme selected by the World AIDS Campaign is "Stop AIDS: Keep the Promise" as it will be through 2010. The day was marked by thousands of events around the world.

"It is now time for bold leadership at all levels in order to turn the tide of HIV," said Felicita Hikuam, Global Programmes Manager, World AIDS Campaign. An estimated 33.2 million people around the world&amp;mdash;one in every 200&amp;mdash;are living with HIV, and approximately 6,800 people are infected with &lt;a href="w%3AHIV"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt; and 5,700 people die of &lt;a href="w%3AAIDS"&gt;AIDS&lt;/a&gt;-related illnesses every day.

"The trend is encouraging but still for every person receiving treatment four others are newly infected," said &lt;a href="w%3ANelson%20Mandela"&gt;Nelson Mandela&lt;/a&gt;, speaking at a concert in &lt;a href="w%3AJohannesburg"&gt;Johannesburg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;. "If we are to stop the Aids epidemic from expanding, we need to break the cycle of new HIV infections. All of us working together with government, communities and civil society can make the difference that is needed," he continued.

As many as 50,000 people attended the concert in Johannesburg, South Africa, which was telecast around the world. It was organized by Nelson Mandela's &lt;a href="w%3A46664%20%28concerts%29"&gt;46664 AIDS campaign&lt;/a&gt; and featured performances by artists such as &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Gabriel"&gt;Peter Gabriel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALudacris"&gt;Ludacris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARazorlight"&gt;Razorlight&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Goo%20Goo%20Dolls"&gt;Goo Goo Dolls&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAnnie%20Lennox"&gt;Annie Lennox&lt;/a&gt;.

At a fundraiser in the town of &lt;a href="w%3AMidrand%2C%20Gauteng"&gt;Midrand&lt;/a&gt;, in the province &lt;a href="w%3AGauteng"&gt;Gauteng&lt;/a&gt;, near Johannesburg on Friday, singer Annie Lennox had strong words for the South African government's AIDS policies.

"AIDS, as Madiba [Mandela] has said, is a human rights issue and should be treated as such in order to avoid this genocide that is affecting millions and millions of people around the world," said Lennox in a speech. Lennox has previously been critical of the South African government's position on suggesting some AIDS medications were toxic. "It is unacceptable that treatment has not been made available to those who need it most," said Lennox.

The rock band &lt;a href="w%3AQueen%20%28band%29"&gt;Queen&lt;/a&gt;, which lost its lead singer &lt;a href="w%3AFreddie%20Mercury"&gt;Freddie Mercury&lt;/a&gt; to AIDS, released a new song entitled, ♡❤Say It's Not True♡❤, to coincide with World Aids Day. It has been made available as a free download from the band's website. "By making the song available for free, we hope to help Nelson Mandela with his campaign to get across the message that no-one is safe from infection," said Queen drummer &lt;a href="w%3ARoger%20Meddows-Taylor"&gt;Roger Taylor&lt;/a&gt;. "We have to be aware, we have to protect ourselves and those we love."

In &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, people distributed AIDS prevention brochures in the streets and promoted safe sex in cities like &lt;a href="w%3ABeijing"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AShanghai"&gt;Shanghai&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href="w%3AChangsha"&gt;Changsha&lt;/a&gt;, official warning signs were put on hotel bedstands. The government announced on Friday an allocation of &lt;a href="w%3AChinese%20yuan"&gt;CNY&lt;/a&gt;860 million for AIDS prevention and control. According to official reports, there are estimated to be 700,000 people living with HIV/AIDS in China.

Also in China, the &lt;a href="w%3AMiss%20World%202007"&gt;Miss World 2007&lt;/a&gt; was in &lt;a href="w%3ASanya"&gt;Sanya&lt;/a&gt; on World AIDS Day. The pageant presented a special tribute to the fight against AIDS, with a televised speech from former South African President Nelson Mandela, along with traditional dancers from South Africa who joined the contestants in a special song.

Friday, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; urged the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Congress"&gt;United States Congress&lt;/a&gt; to double the 2003 Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief to &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;30 billion over the next five years. "Above all, we rededicate ourselves to a great purpose: We will turn the tide against HIV/AIDS&amp;mdash;once and for all," he said.

"I'm pleased to announce that Laura and I will travel to sub-Sahara Africa early next year," Bush said. Sub-Saharan &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; suffered nearly three-quarters of AIDS-related deaths during 2006 and is home to two-thirds of those living with HIV/AIDS.

The draw for the third round of the &lt;a href="w%3AFA%20Cup%202007-08"&gt;2007-08 FA Cup&lt;/a&gt; was held on December 2 in &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;. 

The third round is where teams from the &lt;a href="w%3APremier%20League"&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AFootball%20League%20Championship"&gt;Football League Championship&lt;/a&gt; join the cup.

Aston Villa have been drawn at home to Manchester United. The two teams will meet for the second time in two years. In the &lt;a href="w%3AFA%20Cup%202006-07"&gt;2006-07&lt;/a&gt; encounter Aston Villa were defeated 2-1 at &lt;a href="w%3AOld%20Trafford%20%28football%20ground%29"&gt;Old Trafford&lt;/a&gt;.

There are three other fixtures consisting entirely of Premiership sides: Tottenham Hotspur v Reading, Sunderland v Wigan Athletic and West Ham United v Manchester City.

FA Cup holders Chelsea have been drawn at home against Championship side Queens Park Rangers.

&lt;a href="w%3AConference%20South"&gt;Conference South&lt;/a&gt; team Havant &amp; Waterlooville make their first appearance in the third round after surprising &lt;a href="w%3AFootball%20League%20Two"&gt;League Two&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href="w%3ANotts%20County%20F.C."&gt;Notts County&lt;/a&gt; in the second round. Havant &amp; Waterlooville's potential opponents Horsham will also make their debut at this stage of the FA Cup if they win away to Swansea in their second round replay.

The third round will take place on January 5, 2008. 64 teams will take part in 32 matches, with replays if a match ends in a draw.

&lt;a href="America"&gt;America&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href="w%3Aheavy%20metal"&gt;heavy metal&lt;/a&gt; performer &lt;a href="w%3AOzzy%20Osbourne"&gt;Ozzy Osbourne&lt;/a&gt;, who became famous as the lead vocalist for &lt;a href="w%3ABlack%20Sabbath"&gt;Black Sabbath&lt;/a&gt; and later as a solo act, has raised more than &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;800,000 for The Sharon Osbourne Colon Cancer Program, founded by his spouse at the &lt;a href="w%3ACedars%20Sinai%20Hospital"&gt;Cedars Sinai Hospital&lt;/a&gt;, by auctioning off personal items.

A number of the items that he auctioned off over the two day period have been seen on his reality TV show ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Osbournes"&gt;The Osbournes&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, which featured home life with Sharon, Ozzy and their two children. Amongst some of the higher-priced items were a carved walnut Victorian-style custom built pool table which raised $11,250, a painting from Edourad Drouot which fetched $10,500, a pair of Ozzy's famous round glasses which raised $5,250 and a dog bed given to Sharon by &lt;a href="w%3AElton%20John"&gt;Elton John&lt;/a&gt; which sold for $2,375.

Some more famous items were also amongst the 500 lots offered. Ozzy's black satin coat, complete with bat-wing cape, raised $3,300 and a hand-painted floral cup used regularly on ♡❤The Osbournes♡❤ made $1,625. A bronze plaque of a demon's head that was regularly seen in its position adorning the front door of their house had been expected to go for $800 to $1,200instead raised $8,750. A wire model of the &lt;a href="w%3AEiffel%20Tower"&gt;Eiffel Tower&lt;/a&gt; from on the kitchen table sold for $10,000, while skull-covered trainers Ozzy had worn reached $2,625. Bidders came from as far away as &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; to buy what they could from his mansion in &lt;a href="w%3ABeverly%20Hills"&gt;Beverly Hills&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;.

However, three cars included in the auction failed to attract bidders and did not sell. They were a 2006 Bentley Continental Flying Spur, estimated at $160,000 to $180,000, a 2005 Cadillac CTS-V sedan estimated at $30,000 to $40,000 and a 1950 Oldsmobile Futuramic 88 Club Coupe previously owned by author &lt;a href="w%3ADanielle%20Steel"&gt;Danielle Steel&lt;/a&gt; estimated at $40,000 to $50,000. Sharon had earlier said of the cars "We're not great car people. They really don't do a lot for us.♡❤

Darren Julien, president of Julien's Auctions, which organised the two-day sale, said "It did very well. It raised some good money for a very worthy cause."

"For a celebrity garage sale, it was pretty spectacular.," he went on. He also commented on the fact that there was fierce competition for the many artworks included. "We had Ozzy fans bidding against these sophisticated fine art buyers, which you don't see every day. For the most part the metalheads were outbidding the art crowd."

Once you get a chance to talk to &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Palm%20Beach%2C%20Florida"&gt;West Palm Beach, Florida&lt;/a&gt; native Whitney Cunningham, who placed seventh on the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerica%27s%20Next%20Top%20Model%2C%20Cycle%208"&gt;eighth cycle&lt;/a&gt; of the popular reality TV series ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAmerica%27s%20Next%20Top%20Model"&gt;America's Next Top Model&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, you begin to understand what host &lt;a href="w%3ATyra%20Banks"&gt;Tyra Banks&lt;/a&gt; meant when she described her as the "full package." 

First of all, she is confident and headstrong, which is a must on these kinds of shows, almost as much as it is to take a beautiful modelesque picture. Second, she turns that confidence into drive. She has been receiving steady work as a model since leaving the show, and still believes that her goal of being the first woman to wear a size ten dress on the cover of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AVogue%20%28magazine%29"&gt;Vogue&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ is in reach. Third, and probably most important to television viewers, she obliterates the age-old model stereotype that to be pretty and photograph well, one must also be vapid and without a thought. A graduate of &lt;a href="w%3ADartmouth%20College"&gt;Dartmouth College&lt;/a&gt;, Cunningham also dreams of becoming a writer, and is working toward dual goals: a model who can express herself like no other model before her.

Cunningham recently sat down with Wikinews reporter in an impassioned interview, taking hours to field questions from the reporter as well as from fans of ♡❤America's Next Top Model♡❤. Always in high spirits, Cunningham shows that she is a distinct personality who has carved her own niche in the ♡❤Top Model♡❤ history books. At the same time, she exhibits a ♡❤joie de vivre♡❤ that is oddly reminiscent of earlier ♡❤Top Model♡❤ fan favorite &lt;a href="w%3AToccara%20Jones"&gt;Toccara Jones&lt;/a&gt;, who showed America just how to be "big, black, beautiful and loving it." However, Cunningham is quick to remind everyone that she isn't big at all; she is simply a regular woman.

This is the first in a series of interviews with ♡❤America's Next Top Model♡❤ contestants. Interviews will be published sporadically.

<h2>Whitney's beginnings, and looking back</h2>

♡❤♡Mike Halterman:♡❤♡ So, who were the people you looked up to and inspired you to pursue modeling?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ Did you follow ♡❤America's Next Top Model♡❤ before appearing on the show, and if so, who did you like?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ If you could quickly summarize your experience on the show, how would you describe it?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ What do your friends and family think of your stint on reality TV?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ What were some of your specific pros and cons as a result of entering this contest?

<h2>Impact ♡❤Top Model♡❤ has on society</h2>

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ Do you ever fear what negative effect the show will have on girls? 

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ Do you think that in some way the show can lead to girls developing an obsession with how they look, their weight, etc?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ Did Tyra encourage a certain standard among the girls (weight or otherwise) that was unhealthy?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ Do you think Tyra still believes her show is about finding "the next top model" even though none of the show's winners have had that success?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ A fan wrote in to ask, "What struggles did you face on the show as a plus sized model?"

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ Do you think it was unfair for Tyra to ask that [studying magazines and developing your poses] of you and Diana, considering that even though she's fuller-figured now, she has a lot more experience under her belt than you two did?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ It sounds like you're doing just fine for yourself. Which one fan also asked, "Have you faced adversity about your weight since being on the show?"

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ Another fan writes: Do you feel like "plus size" models are treated fairly? (I put "plus size" in quotes because I don't believe you are "plus size"!)

<h2>Whitney's views on production and editing</h2>

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ Do you believe the producers for shows such as ♡❤Top Model♡❤ intentionally pick people who are perhaps unstable, for better television?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ Can you explain what types of things the producers allow you to say or not say following your departure from the show?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ Who selects your best photo for each panel and do you think there are ulterior motives involved?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ How did they decide who was going to read the Tyra Mail for the episode? Was it random, planned, or was it really who 'discovered' the note each morning?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ Were you forced to fake your excitement over Tyra Mail?

<h2>Whitney takes more fan questions</h2>

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ Do you still keep in touch with girls from your cycle? If so, who?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ What were the pressures like in the house?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ Is it common for agencies or clients to contact you after seeing the show? 

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ And do you get contacted from the guest designers that appeared on your cycle?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ A fan really wanted to know, "Was Dionne as funny as she was on the show?"

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ How did you feel when Dionne and Renee only got T-shirts as a prize for winning the acting challenge?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ There were a lot of negative reactions from fans when Jaslene won. Do you think she was the best choice? If so, why? If not, who would have been the better choice and why?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ Some negative fan reactions were "How could Jaslene sell a product when she can't speak English well?" and "Model? She's not even pretty! She looks like a man!" Which, I wish I was making it up, but it's a rather loud fan voice on those points. What do you say to them about that? And following on that, do you think fans can be excessively cruel toward the contestants?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ You and Diana were some of the only models in this cycle who were working toward a college degree. Did you feel that you were smarter than the other girls? Did people at your college watch Top Model to see you and root for you?

<h2>Where Whitney is today</h2>

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ And on that note, a fan wanted to know if you finished your degree at Dartmouth.

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ This past May, right?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ Do you plan on moving back to Florida, or are you going to continue living in New York City?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ Apart from your spread in Plus Model Magazine, what else are you doing now?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ What is your message to the girls of America who have big dreams of their own? What would you tell them?

The freshly elected president of the World Climate Change Conference &lt;a href="w%3ARachmat%20Witoelar"&gt;Rachmat Witoelar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;n Minister of the environment, as well as his predecessor, &lt;a href="w%3ANabiel%20Makarim"&gt;Nabiel Makarim&lt;/a&gt;, and Yvo de Boer of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Framework%20Convention%20on%20Climate%20Change"&gt;UNFCCC&lt;/a&gt;, called for a breakthrough in negotiations on the first day of the 13th Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC in &lt;a href="w%3ABali"&gt;Bali&lt;/a&gt; today. 

All three speakers agreed that by the end of the conference, which lasts till the 14th of December, an agenda must be set for negotiations on a post-2012 agreement on climate change mitigation. In founding this demand, they each drew on the &lt;a href="w%3AIntergovernmental%20Panel%20on%20Climate%20Change"&gt;IPCC&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AIPCC%20Fourth%20Assessment%20Report"&gt;Fourth Assessment Report&lt;/a&gt;, which establishes that the window for mitigating dangerous climate change closes in year 2030.

The outgoing President of the last session, &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Mwiraria"&gt;David Mwiraria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Kenya"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt;n minister for environment and natural recources, held the first speech making some statements on his term of office. He went on to remind that the least developed, many of which are &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;n nations and the small island states, are the ones that will be hit hardest by global warming, now and in the future.

The new president of the conference, Mr Witoelar, Indonesian minister of the environment agreed with that statement, saying that the "most severe impacts [...] will be felt by poor nations, and the poorest within them" and drew the conclusion that it is "critical that we act, and act now." Looking at the chances for the so-called ♡❤Bali roadmap♡❤ being agreed on, he noted that from consultations he had "heard that there was widespread support from governments" for making this happen. He went on to say that "Many have also expressed support for a target date of 2009". 

As the two speakers before him, Yvo de Boer of the UNFCCC noted that 2007 had been a exceptional year regarding climate change, with multiple political high level meetings being held. He went on to say that the delegates should reach agreement on a multitude of issues that had only been in discussion up until now. Amongst others, these included the organizational questions regarding the Adaptation Fund, which is aimed at funding measures that will increase the adaptive capacity of nations with developing industries. Reaching agreement on these issues would allow their substance to be implemented, and at the same time "free up the negotiation capacity needed for the post-2012 process".

Finally, he addressed the matter of whether the targets that are to be set by 2009 are to be internationally legally binding or not, an issue that the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; is particularly sensitive about. He stated that in his opinion form follows function, making an allegory to the targets needing to be set before agreement being reached on how they are to be mandated .

&lt;a href="China"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; officials have confirmed that a man admitted to a hospital on November 27, died on Sunday from the &lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAvian%20Flu"&gt;Avian Flu&lt;/a&gt; virus.

The man, only being identified as 24-year-old ♡❤Lu♡❤, is from the &lt;a href="w%3AJiangsu"&gt;Jiangsu&lt;/a&gt; Province of eastern China and was admitted to the hospital after having severe flu-like symptoms. Lu was originally diagnosed with &lt;a href="w%3Apneumonia"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;. Tests done on blood samples from Lu confirmed the presence of H5N1.

Officials say that Mr. Lu was never in close contact with dead poultry and there are no reports of any birds being infected in the area and no other reports of human infection.

At least 69 other individuals are being kept at hospitals for observation, after having come in close contact with Mr. Lu, but officials say that none of those individuals are showing any signs of infection.

Lu's death brings the total number of those infected in China by the H5N1 virus to 26, with 17 dying from the virus in China since 2003. This is the first human infection since June of 2007.

&lt;a href="Kevin%20Rudd"&gt;Kevin Rudd&lt;/a&gt;, current &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Australian Labor Party&lt;/a&gt; leader, was sworn in today as &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister of Australia&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="w%3AGovernor-General"&gt;Governor-General&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Jeffrey"&gt;Michael Jeffrey&lt;/a&gt;. Rudd has become the &lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20prime%20ministers%20of%20Australia"&gt;26th&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister since &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;'s federation in 1901.

Former Prime Minister &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party"&gt;Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACoalition%20%28Australia%29"&gt;Coalition&lt;/a&gt; were beaten in the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20federal%20election%2C%202007"&gt;2007 election&lt;/a&gt; which took place last month, by the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Australian Labor Party&lt;/a&gt; who managed to gain the extra 16 seats they needed to have a majority in the &lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;. Mr Howard lost his seat that he held for 33 years, 11 as Prime Minister, to Labor candidate &lt;a href="w%3AMaxine%20McKew"&gt;Maxine McKew&lt;/a&gt;.

Mr Rudd was sworn in at a small ceremony at &lt;a href="w%3AGovernment%20House"&gt;Government House&lt;/a&gt; by Mr Jeffrey, alongside &lt;a href="w%3ADeputy%20Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Deputy Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJulia%20Gillard"&gt;Julia Gillard&lt;/a&gt;, who was also sworn in today. Mr Rudd's wife, &lt;a href="w%3ATherese%20Rein"&gt;Therese Rein&lt;/a&gt; and his three children were also present at the ceremony.

Later that afternoon, Mr Rudd plans to hold a full meeting which all of his newly-sworn-in &lt;a href="w%3AFirst%20Rudd%20Ministry"&gt;ministers&lt;/a&gt; will attend. In late November, Mr Rudd requested that all his ministers attend a visit at two schools in their local electorate before meeting for a &lt;a href="w%3Acaucus"&gt;caucus&lt;/a&gt; meeting on November 30.

The &lt;a href="Sudan"&gt;Sudanese&lt;/a&gt; president &lt;a href="w%3AOmar%20al-Bashir"&gt;Omar al-Bashir&lt;/a&gt; has issued a full pardon to &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; school teacher who was sentenced to 15 days in jail after allowing children in her class to name a teddy bear "&lt;a href="w%3AMuhammad"&gt;Muhammad&lt;/a&gt;".

The decision came after a meeting with two members of a British Muslim group, &lt;a href="w%3ALord%20Ahmed"&gt;Lord Ahmed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABaroness%20Warsi"&gt;Baroness Warsi&lt;/a&gt; who travelled to the Sudan after her imprisonment around a week ago. The imprisonment of the 54 year-old teacher from &lt;a href="w%3ALiverpool"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt; caused international outcry with Muslims in Sudan protesting for her death, and British Muslims protesting for her release.

British &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt; said he was "delighted and relieved" at the decision and Mrs Gibbons said "I am sorry if I caused any distress" in a released statement. Mrs Gibbons is expected to be released into the custody of the British embassy in the Sudan.

On the third day of the 2007 Taipei IT Month in &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, &lt;a href="w%3ALaptop"&gt;notebook computers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Adesktop%20computer"&gt;desktop computers&lt;/a&gt; built with &lt;a href="w%3AAMD"&gt;AMD's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APhenom%20%28processor%29"&gt;♡❤Phenom♡❤ processor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AIntel"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AIntel%20Core%202%23Penryn"&gt;♡❤Penryn♡❤ processor&lt;/a&gt; openly battled for the consumer-market after each company launched their &lt;a href="w%3AMulti-core%20%28computing%29"&gt;quad core&lt;/a&gt; processors.

Intel with partners like &lt;a href="w%3AAcer"&gt;Acer&lt;/a&gt;, Genuine, &lt;a href="w%3AASUS"&gt;ASUS&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ALenovo"&gt;Lenovo&lt;/a&gt; promoted their desktops with ♡❤Core 2 Quad♡❤ and notebooks with ♡❤Centrino Duo♡❤, even though Intel didn't plan to exhibit in IT Month. Intel's Taiwan division is holding two road shows for &lt;a href="w%3ADo%20it%20yourself"&gt;DIY&lt;/a&gt; experts. One was on December 1 while the second will be on December 8.

AMD, on the other hand, put on a showcase for IT Month with a ♡❤"&lt;a href="w%3ABee%20Movie"&gt;Bee Movie&lt;/a&gt;"♡❤ booth-style exhibit at halls 1 and 3 of the &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20World%20Trade%20Center"&gt;Taipei World Trade Center&lt;/a&gt;.

For example, some low-price notebook computers (&lt;a href="w%3AEeePC"&gt;EeePC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AOne%20Laptop%20per%20Child"&gt;OLPC&lt;/a&gt;) were launched before the show because notebook computer manufacturers had considered and evaluated what a consumer really want. Sincerely, I recommend a consumer not be fooled by a its price but to consider its functionality first!"

&lt;a href="Kevin%20Rudd"&gt;Kevin Rudd&lt;/a&gt; has been sworn in as &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;'s new Prime Minister with an agenda of action on climate change and the repeal of unpopular industrial laws. The new &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Labor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFirst%20Rudd%20Ministry"&gt;government&lt;/a&gt; has signed ratification document to the &lt;a href="w%3AKyoto%20Protocol"&gt;Kyoto Protocol&lt;/a&gt; on climate change and also plans to withdraw Australian troops from &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; by the middle of 2008.

The agreement, which will come into force in 90 days, means Australia's &lt;a href="w%3Agreenhouse%20gas"&gt;greenhouse gas&lt;/a&gt; emissions should not be higher than 8 percent above 1990 levels. Environmental groups believe the Australian economy could easily manage even more ambitious targets. &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Connor"&gt;John Connor&lt;/a&gt;, chief executive of the &lt;a href="w%3AClimate%20Institute"&gt;Climate Institute&lt;/a&gt;, says Australia could cut its emissions by 20 percent by 2020.

"What this concludes is that we can actually have a strong leadership position with barely a ripple on economic growth. We'd still see a tripling of the economy through to 2050 and strong employment and quality of life growth," Connor said.

Mr. Rudd's decision to sign the Kyoto climate accord isolates the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, which will now be the only developed nation not to ratify the agreement. Australia's former conservative government refused to ratify Kyoto, saying it would damage the economy with its heavy reliance on coal exports, while countries like &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; were not bound by emissions targets.

Mr. Rudd's cabinet creates a new portfolio of Minister for Climate Change and Water, held by &lt;a href="w%3APenny%20Wong"&gt;Penny Wong&lt;/a&gt;, an ethnic &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; immigrant from &lt;a href="Malaysia"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;. She is one of seven women in cabinet, including &lt;a href="w%3Adeputy%20Prime%20Minister"&gt;deputy Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJulia%20Gillard"&gt;Julia Gillard&lt;/a&gt;. Former rock singer &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Garrett"&gt;Peter Garrett&lt;/a&gt; was sworn in as Environment Minister. Responsibility for running a strong Australian economy now falls to &lt;a href="w%3ATreasurer"&gt;Treasurer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AWayne%20Swan"&gt;Wayne Swan&lt;/a&gt;, one of Prime Minister Rudd's most trusted &lt;a href="w%3Alieutenant"&gt;lieutenant&lt;/a&gt;s. The recently appointed foreign minister &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Smith"&gt;Stephen Smith&lt;/a&gt;, a lawyer from Western Australia, is expected to visit the United States early next year to discuss Australia's plans to pull its troops out of Iraq.
Mr. Rudd's decision to sign the Kyoto Protocol clears the way for his government to play a stronger role when he leads a delegation of four Australian ministers to the &lt;a href="w%3AU.N."&gt;U.N.&lt;/a&gt; climate talks in Bali.

They began Monday and will search for a new carbon emissions scheme to be introduced when the Kyoto treaty expires in 2012.

Representatives of more than 180 nations gathered on the &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;n island of &lt;a href="w%3ABali"&gt;Bali&lt;/a&gt; today to kick off a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;-sponsored conference on global &lt;a href="w%3Aclimate%20change"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt;. The U.N. hopes the meeting will conclude with a road map toward a new agreement on reducing the types of air pollution many scientists believe are driving changes in the earth's climate.

The Bali meeting aims to get countries to commit to working out a new agreement on emissions cuts to extend or replace the &lt;a href="w%3AKyoto%20Protocol"&gt;Kyoto Protocol&lt;/a&gt;, which expires in 2012. Conference president &lt;a href="w%3ARachmat%20Witoelar"&gt;Rachmat Witoelar&lt;/a&gt; of Indonesia told reporters that a detailed proposal is not necessary at this stage, but participation by all nations is vital.

"We will be happy if this Bali road map is general so we will not push for a very detailed in this short time," he said. "The introduction, the process is important."

As the conference opened, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;'s new prime minister, &lt;a href="Kevin%20Rudd"&gt;Kevin Rudd&lt;/a&gt;, signed the Kyoto Protocol, limiting his country's &lt;a href="w%3Agreenhouse%20gas"&gt;greenhouse gas&lt;/a&gt; emissions. That act earned a standing ovation in Bali, and focused attention on the failure of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; to sign the protocol - the only developed nation not to have done so.

"While the current U.S. delegation will not join in serious negotiations over mandatory limits on global warming pollution, they won't be around when the final deal is made in 2009. A new team will be on the field with a very different game plan," he said. "The other nations must not allow the U.S. to derail, delay or water down the Bali mandate."

Senior U.S. negotiator &lt;a href="w%3AHarlan%20Watson"&gt;Harlan Watson&lt;/a&gt; denied his country was blocking progress, saying the U.S. had merely chosen a different course.

"It's up to each country to do the analysis and analyze for themselves if the target is do-able. Obviously the U.S. came to a different conclusion," he said. "We respect the decisions other countries have made and of course ask them to respect the decision that we've made."

&lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; says that the Kyoto Protocol threatened U.S. economic growth, and believes that any future climate-change agreement will be ineffective unless it includes rapidly developing nations such as &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, which are among the world's largest producers of greenhouse gases.

Other subjects on the agenda in Bali include saving the world's remaining forests, and sharing technologies to help developing nations grow in less-polluting ways. The U.N. also hopes to finalize a fund to help countries affected by global warming to cope with the impacts. The money could go toward flood-proof houses, better water management, and crop diversification.

The Bali conference will continue until December 14. Thousands of government representatives, scientists and activists are attending.

The caretaker prime minister of &lt;a href="Belgium"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGuy%20Verhofstadt"&gt;Guy Verhofstadt&lt;/a&gt;, reappeared on the political stage today as he accepted the royal request to suggest solutions to the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Belgian%20government%20formation"&gt;ongoing federal government formation talks&lt;/a&gt;.

Recollecting his statement to the press on June 10, 2007, when he recognised his electoral loss and the victory of his opponent &lt;a href="w%3AYves%20Leterme"&gt;Yves Leterme&lt;/a&gt;, he told reporters today that he "hadn't thought nor hoped to face you once more, but the King has asked me to inform him on a short term about possible strategies to deal with the political stalemate in which we have ended up over the last few months."
Indeed, after 177 days, the country's political parties have still found no compromise on the roles of the French- and Dutch-language community. Two days ago, Leterme returned to &lt;a href="w%3AAlbert%20II%20of%20Belgium"&gt;King Albert II&lt;/a&gt; to tender his resignation as leader of the formation talks.

The incumbent PM said he would discretely contact the leaders of all democratic parties during the next few days. He said his starting point would be dual: the country needs a considerable reform of its federal status, and there are certain urgent problems that outrange the capacities of the caretaker government dealing with the ongoing affairs.

Verhofstadt called for all involved to take responsibility, in the interest of the country and its citizens.

<h1>Neste Oil to build world's largest biodiesel plant in Singapore</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Neste%20Oil%20to%20build%20world%27s%20largest%20biodiesel%20plant%20in%20Singapore&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="Finland"&gt;Finnish&lt;/a&gt; company have announced that they intend to construct the world's largest &lt;a href="w%3Abiodiesel"&gt;biodiesel&lt;/a&gt; plant in &lt;a href="Singapore"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt; at a cost of &lt;a href="w%3AEuro"&gt;€&lt;/a&gt;440 million. The &lt;a href="w%3ANExBTL"&gt;NExBTL&lt;/a&gt; facility will be Neste's third such project, and is intended to have a maximum capacity of 800,000 tonnes a year.

Demand for biofuels is expected to rise greatly over the next few years, as they are often cited as a good way to reduce &lt;a href="w%3Agreenhouse%20gas"&gt;greenhouse gas&lt;/a&gt; emissions, and are viewed as a renewable alternative to &lt;a href="w%3Acrude%20oil"&gt;crude oil&lt;/a&gt; which has been at record high prices in recent months.

The site has been strategically selected to be close to &lt;a href="Malaysia"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;, both of whom are leading world suppliers of &lt;a href="w%3Apalm%20oil"&gt;palm oil&lt;/a&gt;, which is intended to be the main fuel for the plant. Between them they account for 80% of global production. However, the use of palm oil is controversial, as some environmental scientists and campaigners believe using it will have a negative effect as increased demand in turn causes higher food prices and greater levels of deforestation.

Earlier this year, &lt;a href="w%3AGreenpeace"&gt;Greenpeace&lt;/a&gt; attempted to stop a palm oil tanker ship destined to Neste's existing biodiesel plant in &lt;a href="w%3APorvoo"&gt;Porvoo&lt;/a&gt;, Finland, but failed to stop the delivery. In addition to the Porvoo plant, which began operations earlier this year and is at its capacity production of 170,000 tonnes, Neste plan a second plant to open in 2009.

The new plant will increase demand for palm oil, as it will require 200,000 hectares of palm oil plantations to supply the million tonnes of oil it requires per annum. "The new plantations are to be set up mainly in Indonesia, and increasingly in swamp rain forests," said Greenpeace's Lauri Myllyvirta. When such terrain is cleared of trees, the peaty soil begins to dry out. "In the years that follow, it releases all of the carbon that had been stored in it", Myllyvirta continues. He concludes that he believes palm oil cultivated in such conditions produces ten times the &lt;a href="w%3Acarbon%20dioxide"&gt;carbon dioxide&lt;/a&gt; emissions of &lt;a href="w%3Afossil%20fuel"&gt;fossil fuel&lt;/a&gt;s. Jarmo Honkamaa, director of Neste's biofuel sector, countered these claims with his belief that the gas balance remains positive and points to Neste statistics which say biodiesel diesel produces 40-60% less greenhouse gas emissions than standard &lt;a href="w%3Adiesel"&gt;diesel&lt;/a&gt;.

Another potential problem has been highlighted by &lt;a href="w%3ACitigroup"&gt;Citigroup&lt;/a&gt;, who voiced concerns that Neste may not be able to complete the project on time and within the intended budget. Recently, Neste added a standard diesel production line at their Porvoo refinery. This was finished this year, approximately one year late and at an actual cost of €750 million, versus a budget of €500 million. Neste CEO Risto Rinne said in response, "we have learned our lesson," regarding the miscalculations on the new facility, and said that this knowledge, coupled with that obtained during construction of the Porvoo biodiesel plant, had been factored into calculations regarding the Singapore plant.

Construction on the third facility will start early next year, and is scheduled to end in 2010. Neste said in a statement that the investment was "part of Neste Oil's strategic goal of becoming the world's leading renewable diesel producer."

This is following on from the earlier leaking of the 2003 version. Wikileaks passed this document to people they consider experts in the field to carry out an analysis trying to validate it. Following this, they set out to assess what had changed between 2003 and 2004; including attempts to link publicly known incidents with changes to the manual. 

Wikinews obtained the document and did an in-depth analysis. The &lt;a href="American%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union"&gt;American Civil Liberties Union&lt;/a&gt; had previously made a request to view and obtain copies of the same document, but was denied access to them.

One of the first notable changes to the document relates to the detainees themselves. Previously they read the camp rules during admission processing. Rules are now posted around the camp in detainees' languages. The English version of the rules is as follows:
Of concern to groups such as &lt;a href="Amnesty%20International"&gt;Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt; who campaign for the camp's closure, or &lt;a href="Human%20Rights%20Watch"&gt;Human Rights Watch&lt;/a&gt; concerned about prisoner handling under the prisoner of war aspects of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeneva%20Convention"&gt;Geneva Convention&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , is the fact that policy for newly admitted detainees still allows for up to 4 weeks where access to the detainee by the &lt;a href="International%20Committee%20of%20the%20Red%20Cross"&gt;International Committee of the Red Cross&lt;/a&gt; (ICRC) may be denied. In addition, guards are not to allow ICRC staff to pass mail to detainees.

A new process has been formed which allows guards to determine whether or not a detainee receives awards, or is punished. The form is called a ♡❤GTMO Form 508-1 ( to the right)♡❤. According to the manual, the form "is used to determine which rewards the detainee will lose or gain," but "special rewards" can also be earned, outside of the process. One special reward is time allowed outside. Another special reward is a roll of toilet paper, but the detainee cannot share it with others. Doing so will result in "punishment" and confiscation of the roll. If the detainee already has a roll of toilet paper, he is not allowed to have another.

"Guards need to ensure that the detainee doesn't receive additional toilet paper when the detainee already has it. The amount given to the detainee will be the same amount as normally distributed to the detainee," states the manual.

No matter how bad a detainee may act, "haircuts will never be used as punitive action" against them, but they can have hair removed for health reasons. They can, however, be segregated from other detainees.

"If a detainee has committed an offense that requires segregation time, even if a segregation cell is not available, the detainee will receive a shave and a haircut for hygiene and medical reasons. If the detainee is IRFed, the haircut and shave will follow the decontamination process," adds the manual. Barbers are also part of cell searches.

Despite these changes, a great deal of effort has gone into ensuring the furore over detainee abuse does not recur. Rules governing the use of pepper spray (Oleoresin Capsicum, or OC) appear at an earlier point in the manual with considerable expansion. Infractions such as spitting, throwing water at, or attempting to urinate on guards appear as explicitly listed cases where pepper spray may not be used. Extensive decontamination procedures are included in the document, including immediately calling for a medical check on any detainee exposed to pepper spray. This was not previously present.

As a counter to the clearer instructions on use of pepper spray, Wikileaks asserts that many of the stricter rules for guards (referred to as Military Police or MPs in the 2003 manual) aim to reduce fraternisation that may improve detainee morale and adversely influence any interrogation process. Guards are informed in the manual not to take personal mail and parcels within the detention blocks or at any other duty stations. All electronic devices except issued materiel are prohibited, and guards may face disciplinary action should they keep detainees apprised of current affairs or discuss issues in their personal lives.

Additional restrictions on the detainees' chaplain are included in the revised document. Wikileaks speculated that many of these changes might have stemmed from the widely publicised case of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Yee"&gt;James Yee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Captain Yee, a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Point"&gt;West Point&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; graduate, served at the Guantanamo Bay base as a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMuslim"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; chaplain to the detainees and received two Distinguished Service medals for his work. Following discovery of a list of detainees and interrogators by U.S. Customs in Florida Yee was charged with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Asedition"&gt;sedition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , aiding the enemy, spying, espionage, and failure to obey a general order. Eventually all charges were dropped with national security concerns being raised should evidence be released.

The most notable changes surrounding the role of the chaplain include its removal as a permanent position on the facility's Library Working group and its exclusion from the decision process on appropriate detainee reading material. Wikileaks contacted lawyers representing detainees in the camp to perform their own analysis. Their opinion of the changes were that the library operation had been considerably tightened up. Duplicate books are required for the individual four camps to prevent covert use of books to communicate between camps. Periodicals, dictionaries, language instruction books, technology or medical update information, and geography were additions to the prohibited material. Instructions indicate such books must be returned to the source or donor.

The revised SOP manual makes considerable progress on documenting procedures, even those that are remote possibilities. A lengthy addition details rules to follow in the event of an escape or escape attempt. Laced throughout this procedure is an emphasis on having any such incident fully documented and - wherever possible - filmed. The procedure is explicit in how to recapture an escaped detainee with minimal use of force. One additional procedure covers the admission of ambulances to the main base area. A detailed security protocol to ensure only expected and authorised traffic gains access is included, as is a procedure streamlined to ensure the ambulance arrives on the scene as quickly as possible.

Unchanged from the 2003 manual is the set menu of four ready-to-eat meals (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMeal%2C%20Ready-to-Eat"&gt;Meal, Ready-to-Eat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; or MRE) issued to detainees. However, additional steps are to be taken for "MRE Sanitization"; supply personnel must remove anything that can damage waste disposal systems— presumably a military term for toilets. Under normal camp conditions, detainees should be fed hot meals as opposed to MREs, but no details on the variety of menu are included.

Wikinews attempted to get feedback on this. US Southern Command passed a query on to Rick Haupt (Commander, U.S. Navy Director of Public Affairs, Joint Task Force at Guantanamo) who responded that "questions were forwarded along with a request to authenticate the leaked document; a response is pending." At this time no response to emails has been received from the ICRC or Human Rights Watch.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Pentagon"&gt;The Pentagon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has requested that the document be removed from Wikileaks because "information with the FOUO (For Official Use Only) label is not approved for release to the public." They then state that the document can be "made available through a Freedom Of Information Act request through official channels."

She played Rachel Cory, the maven of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAnother%20World%20%28TV%20series%29"&gt;Another World&lt;/a&gt;'s♡❤ fictional town, &lt;a href="w%3ABay%20City%20%28Another%20World%29"&gt;Bay City&lt;/a&gt;, from 1972 to 1999 when the show went off the air. Wyndham talks about how she was seen as the anchor of a show, and the political infighting to keep it on the air as NBC wanted to wrest control of the long-running soap from &lt;a href="w%3AProcter%20%26amp%3B%20Gamble"&gt;Procter &amp; Gamble&lt;/a&gt;. Wyndham fought to keep it on the air, but eventually succumbed to the inevitable. She discusses life on the soap opera, and the seven years she spent wandering "in the woods" of Los Angeles seeking direction, now divorced from a character who had come to define her professional career. Happy, healthy and with a family she is proud of, Wyndham has found life after the death of ♡❤Another World♡❤ in painting and animals. Below is 's interview with the soap diva.
<h2>Career and motherhood</h2>
♡❤♡How are you doing?

♡❤♡You look great. You look amazing.

♡❤♡How’s the sculpture?

♡❤♡Both of your sons have gone on to creative careers. &lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20Camargo"&gt;Christian Camargo&lt;/a&gt; is an actor, and the other is a &lt;a href="w%3Aphotographer"&gt;photographer&lt;/a&gt;?

♡❤♡When your sons decided that they wanted to pursue careers that were not so assured in income, like a lawyer or a doctor, but more something that is a creative enterprise like a photographer or an actor …

♡❤♡As any mother would…

♡❤♡How has it been since you left ‘Another World?’ 

♡❤♡That’s after ‘Another World’?

♡❤♡Anywhere. It doesn’t matter what it is. 

♡❤♡Unrefined talent.

♡❤♡Awesome. That’s big.

♡❤♡They must get a kick out of that though. 

<h2>The politics behind the demise of Another World</h2>
♡❤♡When you’re known so well for one particular role--Rachel Cory in Another World--yet you are multi-dimensional, how do you handle the frustration that must breed inside yourself?

♡❤♡But it doesn’t bother you to just be recognized for one role?

♡❤♡You weren’t particularly happy with that story line though. At first you didn’t mind, but then after …

♡❤♡Why?

♡❤♡And you were one of the main draws on the show? So if they got rid of you …. 

♡❤♡Why did they not want the show anymore?

♡❤♡Flopped, like ♡❤Passions♡❤ did. They were throwing midgets out there--

♡❤♡How do you not let that go to your head? How do you keep calm after something like that?

♡❤♡It’s tenuous, like a tooth hanging by a thread.

♡❤♡NBC wanted all the profits.

<h2>Wyndham's efforts to save Another World</h2>
♡❤♡Is that the soap opera model, that there needs to be certain character anchors--like a Susan Lucci--on the show that exist and then they can kind of shuffle up the newer characters? 

♡❤♡Although it’s a different idea because a soap is daily and you have people who watch it as if it’s a part of their lives opposed to a weekly drama. I mean, you were twenty-five years on ’Another World’ ….

♡❤♡What was the updated version of soap operas that you envisioned?

♡❤♡They would turn to you for ideas?

♡❤♡And you also knew history.

♡❤♡I read that they didn’t care about the history and the traditions in Another World?

♡❤♡“She’ll never be able to play that off. He’ll be able to…..” That kind of stuff?

♡❤♡Do you still keep in touch with a lot of the people from the show?

♡❤♡Isn’t that odd?

♡❤♡Do you find that that’s true in almost every friendship situation though?

♡❤♡That there’s a need for commonality …..?

♡❤♡They all move on to the next thing.

♡❤♡What was that?

♡❤♡What’s the fourth wall?

♡❤♡Is that typical?

<h2>The future of soap operas</h2>
♡❤♡Where do you think soaps are going to go now?

♡❤♡Would you go back to one?

♡❤♡But twenty-five years on a soap. It’s so funny to hear you say you weren’t interested. I understand you had your children. It was a good gig, steady income. It kept you on the east coast. 

♡❤♡If you’re going to do something, do it well.

♡❤♡Why do they not want to change?

♡❤♡Where else do you see that in the culture?

♡❤♡Or Showtime.

♡❤♡You saw that with The Sopranos and Six Feet Under.

♡❤♡Pay some writers.

♡❤♡How does someone become a soap actor? Is it something they fall into or is it something that is pursued?

♡❤♡And the emotion that goes with live performance.

♡❤♡Really? Is it more of a function of modernity or more of a function of youth that they‘re like that?

<h2>Wyndham's career and making it as a creative</h2>
♡❤♡You’ve never wanted to do a film?

♡❤♡Are you turning down projects now?

♡❤♡You’re not at that point anymore where you need to work. 

♡❤♡Every actor’s worry.

♡❤♡Why haven’t you gone more toward the writing.

♡❤♡Have you ever tried to use a pseudonym?

♡❤♡Just for fun you should do it, just as an experiment. Change your name and send it. Be like, “Hi, I’m a young intrepid writer and I have this script.” Not just a soap opera actress.

♡❤♡But the difference is what they say and what they do. Show business is known as such a vicious industry. 

♡❤♡To your face. 

♡❤♡But isn’t that even more disenchanting when someone is like, “You’re the best. You’re so great.” And the next thing you know is, “That person thinks you suck.” And your like, “We just had this great meeting. I thought that they loved me.”

♡❤♡How do you persevere? Even when you were younger and not in the comfortable place you are now?

♡❤♡Aside from good acting, what was the secret to your longevity? It’s not just good acting that gets you staying around that long. 

♡❤♡Or Norman Mailer …

<h2>Television's lust for youth</h2>
♡❤♡Are you putting yourself out there for roles?

♡❤♡Do you think that that model where you have 23-year-olds playing 18-year-olds and you have 23-year-olds playing 30-year-olds is getting old? Don’t you think people are getting sick of seeing just …

♡❤♡Yeah. Don’t you think it’s at the point where it’s becoming a farce? Is that really what people want?

♡❤♡I understand the WB and UPN Networks that 16-year-olds want to watch people who look like they’re 16.

♡❤♡That’s only a small portion of the populace. 

♡❤♡Some realistic depictions of life or interesting stories that are well written, but not all played by people who are 22.

♡❤♡Could people transcend that? I was watching The Sopranos last night and Lauren Bacall was on it and I was transfixed watching her. Is it more because it’s Lauren Bacall or is it more so just cause it’s just interesting? Remember like the mother on that show ….

♡❤♡So it’s laziness that’s giving us all of this all of this, “Oh just throw on a smooth skin and thus we don’t have to worry about the writing as much. We don’t have to worry about whether the story is engaging.”

♡❤♡Which Showtime repeated.

♡❤♡But they’ve got fat people. They’ve got short people. They’ve got nerds.

♡❤♡Normal people. And that was wildly popular.

♡❤♡It’s self defeating because in the end people stop watching.

♡❤♡Why is it so difficult to see?

♡❤♡Where do you think the disconnect is? Do you think it’s a disconnect between people who don’t know their product that they have on the air, like you have executives who really don’t follow it and it is what it is and stick with it?

♡❤♡It’s the teenagers who come home from school 

<h2>Her relationship today to the character Rachel Cory</h2>
♡❤♡Do you still get mobbed on the streets when you walk?

♡❤♡How does that feel? Is it strange for you, because you probably were accustomed to that for so long?

♡❤♡To just walk into Saks and shop and not have it.

♡❤♡Is it annoying to talk about Rachel Cory still?

♡❤♡Were there certain writers who you just had it out with and you were like, ‘This is just not going to go?’

♡❤♡Is there any that stand out that you‘d want to name?

♡❤♡They were that bad? You remember the good ones, but not the bad ones? 

♡❤♡Matriarch.

♡❤♡What would be one story line that really stands out to you that you were like, “why didn’t we explore this more? This was an important issue.”

<h2>Wyndham on a higher power and the creative process</h2>
♡❤♡Do you believe in a higher power?

♡❤♡What is that higher power?

♡❤♡Do you go to church?

♡❤♡Do you pray?

♡❤♡Daily?

♡❤♡It’s when you feel moved?

♡❤♡Why do you think it’s difficult for people to pull instinct out from inside themselves and actually use it? As an actor, as an artist on any level, you have to? It’s almost like this little well inside yourself that when you get those little goose bumps and say, ’Oh, this is good.’

♡❤♡You have to go with it. But there’s a lot of people who, even if they have that feeling they talk themselves down from it. “Oh, this is actually crap. Oh, this is bad. Oh, this is stupid.”

♡❤♡How do you hold on to that feeling without talking yourself down from it?

♡❤♡In what way?

♡❤♡It took the art out of it?

<h2>After AW: Wyndham lost in California</h2>
♡❤♡It must get tiresome to constantly need to educate a new person every time, especially if they didn‘t get it and you’re like, ‘No, that’s not what I was saying. This was what I was saying. You misunderstood.’

♡❤♡The kids were grown up and you didn’t have to be back here anymore so you tried California?

♡❤♡But don’t you feel better for having done it and knowing as opposed to always wondering?

<h2>Wyndham discovers painting</h2>
♡❤♡How did you get out of that wilderness?

♡❤♡That was seven years? Seven years in Tibet?

♡❤♡What’s his name?

♡❤♡How did you meet him?

♡❤♡L.A. is a mess, and you always get stuck in traffic.

♡❤♡So the class that you were in was not interesting, but you went to another class?

♡❤♡The gooseflesh.

♡❤♡What did it end up doing for you?

♡❤♡What did you do with that experience? You came back to the east coast?

♡❤♡And there’s nothing you can do about it?

♡❤♡Charles Keating?

♡❤♡And that pulled you out of this funk?

♡❤♡When did you decide to leave and come back?

♡❤♡What was that panic?

♡❤♡I’m not getting calls.

♡❤♡Was that hard being divorced from that character?

♡❤♡How is the inspiration for the art different from the inspiration you would draw for characters?

♡❤♡Totally different worlds. 

♡❤♡What is it that you’re saying now in your art?

<h2>Wyndham on the state of the world</h2>
♡❤♡If you could choose the way you die, how would you choose?

♡❤♡And if there is a God, and you went up there, what do you think God would say to you?

♡❤♡But say it’s true.

♡❤♡And do you think He would? Or she?

♡❤♡It’s true. Has the Iraq war affected you? 

♡❤♡How so?

♡❤♡Do you think the country has changed?

♡❤♡I got into an argument when I was in law school. My professor came out against this really famous opinion which was almost what our entire notions of free speech are called California v. Whitney. It was written by this very famous justice about a hundred years ago named Brandeis.

♡❤♡Yeah. And he said in my class and I—something that law students don’t do; I didn’t fit in very well there—I took him on in the middle of 120 students and said, “I can’t believe you would say that he would not write that opinion today.” And he said, ‘Everything’s changed. It is thinking like yours that is why we discuss torture.”

♡❤♡Oh he said that we have religious extremism now. We can’t tell who are our enemies. We have all these new things. And I said, ‘All of these things have existed in the past just because they are wrapped up in a different package or it’s a new mixture of ingredients doesn’t change them. In Vietnam we had people who were disguised as regular Vietnamese, driving our jeeps and blowing up our bases. That’s not anything different than what we have now. I said we had the first World Trade Center attack where that happened. That’s not a reason to all of a sudden start questioning our free speech rights just because it’s dressed up in a different package.

♡❤♡World War I, IRA. That was Protestant versus Catholic regligious extremism. The UK had that. Just because we as Americans haven’t seen a certain kind of thing before doesn’t mean it’s new.

♡❤♡It’s amazing that we debate these things now.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Developing%20nations%20bring%20technology%20transfer%20on%20agenda%20against%20resistance%20of%20Canada%2C%20Japan%20and%20US&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A sub-body of the World Climate Change Conference today took up the item of "Development and transfer of technologies" on its Agenda, and subsequently decided to establish a contact group to speed up negotiations. Both the declaration of the new Agenda item, as well as the setting up of the Contact group, came after lengthy discussions that were polarized between the Group of 77 + China (G77+C), which is comprised of about 130 nations with developing industries, and the Umbrella group, which consists of most of the nations with highly industrialized economies, but the EU countries. . 

The sub-body, called the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) is, as its name implies, amongst other things responsible for preparing and implementing decisions of the main body of the &lt;a href="w%3AUNFCCC"&gt;UNFCCC&lt;/a&gt;, the Conference of the Parties (COP). After having spent a large part of the morning discussing formalities regarding whether or not technology transfer was to be taken up as a separate item, the afternoon session had to be extended till around 9 pm local time. Even then some of the planned agenda items had not been concluded when the session closed.

The cause for discussion in the morning were two different interpretations of a decision the COP made yesterday: Member states of the G77+C believed that the referral of the item of tech transfer by the COP automatically lead to its inclusion on the agenda as a separate item, while the Chairman of the SBI and the US voiced the opinion that to for it to be included, the item would have to be formally agreed upon in the normal manner. Compromise, of one sort or another, could not be reached, and it was only after a legal adviser stated that in his point of view the item indeed was necessarily included on the agenda as a separate item that the matter could be concluded.

Due to the stalling in the mornings session, discussions on the actual item of technology transfer began after what would have been the scheduled closing time. South Africa made the proposal to set up a contact group for the item, so that it could be discussed in a setting with less participants in an informal way. A number of G77+C nations (including China and Nigeria) spoke out in support of this proposal, emphasizing that rapid progress was needed on the issue. Japan, and the US made critical statements, noting that they believed that the scope of the contact group should first be established, and that it would be more sensible to establish the contact group in 2008. After it was found that the group would nevertheless be established, the Chairman asked for suggestions for Co-chairs of the group, as one from the Annex I and one from the non Annex one would be required. The non-Annex I having already decided that they supported Prof. Philip M. Gwage from Uganda as Co-chair, the Annex I countries decided that Jukka Uosukainen from Finland would be the Co-chair on their behalf after brief deliberations. The decision being reached provoked some applause from delegates and observers, and the session was closed shortly thereafter.

&lt;a href="w%3AASUS%20Eee%20PC"&gt;ASUS Eee PC&lt;/a&gt;, earlier launched world-wide for cost-saving and functionality factors, became a hot topic in 2007 &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei"&gt;Taipei&lt;/a&gt; IT Month. But the consumer market on &lt;a href="w%3Alaptop%20computer"&gt;laptop computer&lt;/a&gt; will be radically varied and changed after &lt;a href="w%3AASUS"&gt;ASUS&lt;/a&gt; was awarded in the 2007 &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; Sustainable Award by &lt;a href="w%3AExecutive%20Yuan"&gt;Executive Yuan&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20of%20China"&gt;Republic of China&lt;/a&gt;.

Chairman of ASUS Jonney Shih said: "With this award, we [ASUS] are progressively approved by consumers with our quality and service," and stressed: "We'll have a great opportunity to look on bright factor on the Ratio of Sale on Eee PC world-wide including Taiwan."

Recently in fact, several laptop manufacturers launched multiple laptops not only low-price laptops but also others with Intel Centrino Duo or AMD Athlon 64x2 inside for different consuming population. And those manufacturers battled also on the high-definition AV market with theirs launch. No matter what their market battle will transform, the consumer will be the survivor and winner at this battle.

<h1>US Congress debates Iraq funding</h1>

The &lt;a href="United%20States%20Congress"&gt;United States Congress&lt;/a&gt; has returned from a two-week recess to face a busy agenda before it completes its session later this month. President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; is urging lawmakers to approve his funding request for the wars in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; as a first priority.
President Bush renewed his criticism of majority &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt; in Congress who want to tie a timetable for the withdrawal of &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; troops from Iraq with approval of more funds for the war effort.

"It's unconscionable to deny funds to our troops in harm's way because some in Congress want to force a self-defeating policy &amp;mdash; especially when we're seeing the benefits of success," said President Bush.

Mr. Bush says progress made on the battlefield as a result of a boost in the number of troops in Iraq this year would be undermined by a troop withdrawal timeline.

The President has requested &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;196 billion for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The House of Representatives has approved US$50 billion of that. But in the Senate, &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; blocked a similar funding package last month because it included a timetable for a troop withdrawal.

Senate Majority Leader &lt;a href="Harry%20Reid"&gt;Harry Reid&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="Nevada"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt; Democrat, said the failure of the Senate to approve the war funding should not be blamed on the Democrats.

"If not for the stubborn refusal of the president and his Republicans enablers to work with us, we would have accomplished a lot more," said Senator Reid.

Although Mr. Bush had warned that the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense"&gt;Pentagon&lt;/a&gt; would be forced to begin laying off civilian employees if the funds are not received soon, Senator Reid said the Pentagon could shift funds for the war effort from other accounts.

Besides funding for the war, Congress must also pass legislation funding government agencies and programs. In addition, lawmakers may also try to revise a wiretapping law that expires in two months.

The &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; teacher jailed for letting her students name a teddy bear "&lt;a href="w%3AMuhammad"&gt;Muhammad&lt;/a&gt;" as part of a writing project arrived in England after being pardoned - ending a case that set off an international outcry and angered many moderate &lt;a href="w%3AMuslims"&gt;Muslims&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AGillian%20Gibbons"&gt;Gillian Gibbons&lt;/a&gt; is back home after serving eight days of a 15-day sentence for allowing her students to name a teddy bear "Muhammad" as part of a writing project. This angered &lt;a href="Sudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt;ese authorities who said it was an insult to the &lt;a href="w%3AIslamic"&gt;Islamic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aprophet"&gt;prophet&lt;/a&gt;. She was released after being pardoned by Sudan's President &lt;a href="w%3AOmar%20al-Bashir"&gt;Omar al-Bashir&lt;/a&gt;.

In Britain, the obviously relieved Gibbons said she was concerned she might have offended people.

"It has been an ordeal but I would like you to know that I was well-treated in prison and everybody was very kind to me. I was very sorry to leave Sudan. I had a fabulous time there. It is a really lovely place, and I managed to see some of the beautiful countryside while I was there," she said. "The Sudanese people I found to be extremely kind and extremely generous, and until this happened to me, I only had a good experience."

Gibbons could have received 40 &lt;a href="w%3Alashes"&gt;lashes&lt;/a&gt; or a six-month jail sentence. After her sentencing last week, hundreds of Sudanese demonstrated for a stiffer sentence, with some calling for her to be &lt;a href="w%3Aexecuted"&gt;executed&lt;/a&gt;.

Gibbons' arrest resulted in an international outcry and a tense stand-off between Sudan and Britain. It was also widely condemned by British Muslims. Her release followed the intervention of two Muslim peers, &lt;a href="w%3ALord%20Ahmed"&gt;Lord Ahmed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABaroness%20Warsi"&gt;Baroness Warsi&lt;/a&gt; who travelled to &lt;a href="w%3AKhartoum"&gt;Khartoum&lt;/a&gt; and met Monday with President Omar al- Bashir.

A senior adviser of president &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Bush"&gt;Bush&lt;/a&gt; said Mr. Bashir insisted Gibbons had received a fair trial.

The anti-&lt;a href="w%3Apoverty"&gt;poverty&lt;/a&gt; group &lt;a href="w%3AOxfam"&gt;Oxfam&lt;/a&gt; says &lt;a href="w%3Aglobal%20warming"&gt;global warming&lt;/a&gt; is altering the human food supply and threatening some of the world's poorest people with hunger. At the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20United%20Nations%20Climate%20Change%20Conference"&gt;Conference on Climate Change&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ABali"&gt;Bali&lt;/a&gt;, the group argued &lt;a href="w%3Adeveloped%20countries"&gt;developed countries&lt;/a&gt; should pay to address the problem, and costs could top $50 billion a year. 

Climate change, which many scientists believe is fuelled by human activities, alters rain cycles and causes increased droughts and flooding. Rising temperatures mean some traditional crops do not grow as well as they used to. The United Nations predicts that in some &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;n countries, crop yields could fall by half.

Oxfam researcher Kate Raworth says coping with these issues will be expensive.

"Oxfam has estimated that for all developing countries to adapt to climate change will cost at least $50 billion a year," she said. "And for that to be done with justice we believe that the rich and the most polluting countries should pay the vast share of the money to make possible for those countries most vulnerable and least responsible for causing the problem to cope with the new realities they have to deal with."

The report released by Oxfam at the conference on Tuesday says some countries are already feeling the effects of a warming planet. In &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;, farmers are planting faster-maturing crops to adapt to unpredictable rainfall.

&lt;a href="Bangladesh"&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;is are creating floating vegetable gardens that can thrive in spite of floods. But Mozaharul Alam, who heads Bangladesh's climate adaptation effort, says overall improvements to the food system still leave many families vulnerable.

"Most of the agriculture is subsistent in nature," said Alam. "So if [there is] any failure of the crop on the ground, even if there is food available in the market, unless the people has the buying capacity, that availability of the food in the market has no meaning to the vulnerable family."

Oxfam argues the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; should be among the major sources of funds to help developing countries solve their climate change problems.

These countries have agreed in principle, but one task of the Bali Conference is to find out how much individual countries are willing to spend on climate-related issues. It also aims to begin deciding how to divide those resources between prevention of further climate change, and adaptation to the changes that are already taking place.

The conference involves thousands of scientists, government officials and development group representatives, and runs for another 10 days.

On Tuesday, the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Homeland%20Security%20and%20Governmental%20Affairs"&gt;Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate%20Homeland%20Security%20and%20Governmental%20Affairs%20Permanent%20Subcommittee%20on%20Investigations"&gt;Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations&lt;/a&gt; held a hearing titled "Credit Card Practices: Unfair Interest Rate Increases." The hearing examined the circumstances under which credit card issuers may increase the interest rates of cardholders who are in compliance with the terms of their credit cards. It was a follow-up to a March 2007 hearing.

Subcommittee Chairman &lt;a href="w%3ACarl%20Levin"&gt;Carl Levin&lt;/a&gt; said in his opening statement: "Today's focus is on credit card issuers who hike the interest rates of cardholders who play by the rules &amp;mdash; meaning those folks who pay on time, pay at least the minimum amount due, and wake up one day to find their interest rate has gone through the roof &amp;mdash; again, not because they paid late or exceeded the credit limit, but because their credit card issuer decided they should be 'repriced'."

Present to testify on behalf of credit card issuers were Roger C. Hochschild of &lt;a href="w%3ADiscover%20Financial"&gt;Discover Financial Services&lt;/a&gt;, Bruce L. Hammonds of &lt;a href="w%3ABank%20of%20America"&gt;Bank of America Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, and Ryan Schneider of &lt;a href="w%3ACapitol%20One"&gt;Capital One Financial Corporation&lt;/a&gt;.

Much of the 90 minute hearing focused on specific cases where interest rates were raised, allegedly because &lt;a href="w%3Acredit%20rating"&gt;credit scores&lt;/a&gt; of the debtor dropped, and not because they were delinquent or otherwise behind on payments. According to Levin, this practice made it so that almost all payments went towards finance charges with almost none toward repaying the principal. This, he felt, is an unfair practice, as the credit card companies were negligent in informing their customers of the rate hikes and the reason for such hikes.
The collective credit card debt of Americans totals an estimated &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;900 billion. Issuers have come under pressure to disclose their policies in regards to setting fees and interest rates. The US &lt;a href="w%3ATruth%20in%20Lending%20Act"&gt;Truth in Lending Act&lt;/a&gt; requires that terms of a loan be set forth up front. Fluctuating interest rates on credit cards would, on the surface, appear to violate this act.

Roger C. Hochschild disagreed, arguing that "every card transaction is a new extension of credit ... This makes it difficult &amp;mdash; and risky &amp;mdash; to underwrite, and price, the loan based solely on the borrower's credit-worthiness at the time of application [for the card]."

Ryan Schneider, agreed: "The ability to modify the terms of a credit card agreement to accommodate changes over time to the economy or the credit-worthiness of consumers must be preserved."

"Attempts to interfere with the market here ... will inevitably result in less credit being offered," warned Bruce Hammonds. "Risk-based pricing has democratized access to credit," he added.

All three credit card executives also mentioned an ongoing &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Reserve%20System"&gt;Federal Reserve System&lt;/a&gt; review of credit card rules that already proposes a 45-day notification ahead of any rate changes.

Committee members criticized the industry for varying practices. Included in the criticism was the practice of mailing checks to card-holders, failing to notify applicants that obtaining additional cards could lower their credit score and raise their rates, and "ambushing" card-holders with raised rates.

Ranking minority member of the subcommittee, &lt;a href="w%3ANorm%20Coleman"&gt;Norm Coleman&lt;/a&gt; said, "families find themselves ensnared in a seemingly inescapable web of credit card debt. They particularly report being saddled with interest rates that skyrocketed on them seemingly out of the blue."

In an exclusive report, the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; military has confirmed to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, in an e-mail, the authenticity of the 2004 &lt;a href="w%3AStanding%20operating%20procedure"&gt;Standard Operating Procedures&lt;/a&gt; (SOP) for &lt;a href="w%3ACamp%20Delta"&gt;Camp Delta&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20Bay%20Naval%20Base"&gt;U.S. Naval base&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AGuant%C3%A1namo%20Bay"&gt;Guantánamo Bay&lt;/a&gt;, which was leaked by ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWikileaks"&gt;Wikileaks&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ on December 3, and first reported on by ♡❤Wikinews.♡❤

"The document appears to be a valid 2004 Camp Delta SOP," said Rick Haupt, Commander, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Navy"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt; Director of Public Affairs, &lt;a href="w%3ATask%20force"&gt;Joint Task Force&lt;/a&gt; (JTF), Guantanamo Bay.

"While the document is 'Unclassified,' it is designated '&lt;a href="w%3ASensitive%20but%20unclassified"&gt;For Official Use Only&lt;/a&gt;' and for many reasons (to include the safety and security of U.S. service members) was not intended for mass distribution," added Haupt.

The recent leak of the 2004 SOP states that some detainees may be punished for violating the rules of the camp. Despite recent claims of torture and extreme interrogation measures, Haupt states that all detainees are treated humanely and that most are providing information on terrorist activities.

"JTF Guantanamo policy is clear - we treat all detainees humanely. The JTF operates safe, humane and professional detention operations for unlawful enemy combatants. These enemy combatants are dangerous men and are providing valuable information in preventing further terrorist attacks around the world," said Haupt.

Haupt also goes on to say that the manual changes when warranted, and that the changes in the SOP from 2003 are significant.

"It is important to understand that SOPs by definition, undergo periodic review and change as situations warrant. Detention operations at JTF-Guantanamo have evolved significantly since 2004, prompting many SOP changes. Additionally, there have been three changes in Command leadership since
2004; Maj. Gen. Hood, Rear Adm. Harris, and Rear Adm. &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20H.%20Buzby"&gt;Buzby&lt;/a&gt;," said Haupt.

Haupt declined to discuss the content or the changes of the SOP to ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ for reasons of security.

"As a general rule, for reasons of personnel safety and operational security, the U.S. military will not publicly discuss the specific contents of SOP's," added Haupt.

&lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt; scientists have said in a study that burning your food may lead to certain types of cancer, particularly in women. Scientists also say that more research is needed to make a definite determination and that there are other factors that could be to blame.

"This new study supports our current advice, which already assumes that acrylamide has the potential to be a human carcinogen. Since acrylamide forms naturally in a wide variety of cooked foods, it is not possible to have a healthy, balanced diet that avoids it," said a &lt;a href="w%3AFood%20Standards%20Agency"&gt;Food Standards Agency&lt;/a&gt; spokesperson.

According to the study, &lt;a href="w%3Aacrylamides"&gt;acrylamides&lt;/a&gt;, a chemical produced when cooking foods high in &lt;a href="w%3Acarbohydrate"&gt;carbohydrates&lt;/a&gt; over 120 degrees Celsius (248 degrees Fahrenheit) in the frying, toasting and grilling processes, is a likely cause of some &lt;a href="w%3Awomb"&gt;womb&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aovarian%20cancer"&gt;ovarian cancers&lt;/a&gt;. Although it was found in 2002 that the chemical may be a cause of some cancers, the new study shows, for the first time, a link between the chemical in a human diet being a cause. To date, there is no evidence to suggest the chemical may cause &lt;a href="w%3Abreast%20cancer"&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;.

Scientists followed and monitored 120,000 people over an 11-year-period, of whom 62,000 were women. Of the women, 300 ended up contracting ovarian cancer with 327 contracting womb cancer.

The study concluded that more than 40 micrograms of the chemical, or one bag of potato chips per day, is twice as likely to cause cancer in women. 

"General advice, resulting from this project, is to avoid overcooking when baking, frying or toasting carbohydrate-rich foods," said a spokesman for the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3AExecutive%20Yuan"&gt;central government&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;'s attempts to remove symbols referring to &lt;a href="w%3AChiang%20Kai-shek"&gt;Chiang Kai-shek&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="w%3AChiang%20Kai-shek%20Memorial%20Hall"&gt;Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall&lt;/a&gt;, have led to a major debate between the &lt;a href="w%3APan-Green%20Coalition"&gt;Pan-Green&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APan-Blue%20Coalition"&gt;Pan-Blue&lt;/a&gt; coalitions and the public. The &lt;a href="w%3AMinistry%20of%20Education%20%28Republic%20of%20China%29"&gt;Ministry of Education&lt;/a&gt; wants to remove the title from the "Gate of Great Centrality and Perfect Uprightness" along the Hall. Chiang Kai-shek of the &lt;a href="w%3AKuomintang"&gt;Kuomintang&lt;/a&gt; (part of the pan-Blue coalition) was the leader of the national government from 1928 to 1975, and the Hall was built as a Memorial after his death.

Officials from &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei"&gt;Taipei&lt;/a&gt; City Government and Pan-Blues firmly opposed the plan, but relatives and survivors from the &lt;a href="w%3A228%20Incident"&gt;228 Incident&lt;/a&gt; (a Taiwanese uprise that started on February 28, 1947 that was violently suppressed by the Kuomintang government under Chiang Kai-Shek) and Pan-Greens are in favor.

In fact, members from "League of Redress White-terror in 1950's" claimed in a press conference: "The slaughterer [referring to Chiang Kai-shek and relatives] should admit and apologize for his faults so that we can consider on forgiveness," and stressed: "DAMN IT! Why is the public still supporting the slaughterer and autocrat? How can an autocrat's virtues be eulogized? The public in other countries can trace on the truth from history and jury for the slaughterer, why can't it be so in Taiwan?"

The debate has become a topic in the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20of%20China%20presidential%20election%2C%202008"&gt;2008 Taiwanese Presidential elections&lt;/a&gt;. Kuomintang Candidate &lt;a href="w%3AMa%20Ying-jeou"&gt;Ying-jeou Ma&lt;/a&gt; said: "If I win this election, I'll put the title back!" After the current &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;President of the Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AChen%20Shui-bian"&gt;Shui-bian Chen&lt;/a&gt; heard those words, he replied: "Did he mean on &lt;a href="w%3ALi%20Lianying"&gt;Lian-ying Li&lt;/a&gt;'s?" But the &lt;a href="w%3AVice%20President%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;Vice President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAnnette%20Lu"&gt;Annette Lu&lt;/a&gt; said: "Depend on what &lt;a href="w%3AFrank%20Hsieh"&gt;Frank (Hsieh)&lt;/a&gt; will say."

As the 2007 &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei"&gt;Taipei&lt;/a&gt; IT Month went to the 6th day yesterday, different &amp; multiple marketing battles took place in it. In fact, not only &lt;a href="w%3Alaptops"&gt;laptop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Adesktop%20computer"&gt;desktop computers&lt;/a&gt;, but also the gaming industry. They battled from &lt;a href="w%3Ahigh-definition"&gt;high-definition&lt;/a&gt; AV-medias to applications on recreation and sports not only in &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; but evidently in &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; while some new gaming platforms launched recently.

<h2>High-definition market prepares for newly-launched games and platforms</h2>

Recently, partners from &lt;a href="w%3ASony"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APlayStation%203"&gt;PS3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AXbox%20360"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt; launched and announced several games for different gamers. But following to the upgrades, on some gaming platforms and &lt;a href="w%3AFlat%20panel%20display"&gt;FPD&lt;/a&gt; manufacturers promoted their products on &lt;a href="w%3A1080p"&gt;Full HD&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AHigh-Definition%20Multimedia%20Interface"&gt;HDMI&lt;/a&gt; features, gaming developers should change plans to upgrade their tools to fulfill requirements on upgraded platforms.
<h2>Not only for entertainment, but also for recreation and sports</h2>
As &lt;a href="w%3AWii"&gt;Wii&lt;/a&gt; became another hot topic besides on Xbox 360 &amp; PS3 and was focused by some consumers after &lt;a href="w%3ANintendo"&gt;Nintendo&lt;/a&gt; launched Wii started from &lt;a href="w%3AWii%20Sports"&gt;Wii Sports&lt;/a&gt;, "&lt;a href="w%3AXaviXPort%20gaming%20console"&gt;XaviXPORT&lt;/a&gt;", a sports gaming platform imported to Taiwan on October and spoken by movie star &lt;a href="w%3AJackie%20Chan"&gt;Jackie Chan&lt;/a&gt;, became a strong contingent for Wii.
According to Heng Leong Hang Co., Ltd., a sales manager was interviewed by who said: "Currently, companies from gaming industry often considered on sense of AV-medias, this firmly brought profits for platform companies. However, health condition for several modern people may go bad to worse if they don't realize the importance and concepts on healthy. For example, some gaming companies with small-business scale in Japan had considered an important factor with 'enjoyment and healthiness', that's why some similar platforms battled in the recreation and sports industry. The best practice is a battle recently between Wii Sports &amp; XaviXPORT."

<h2>Summary</h2>
It can't be ignored that the gaming market brought opportunities for developers. But currently in the presence, a multiple battle from the gaming industry competed not only "what a consumer will buy" but also in the FPD markets and recreation &amp; sports industries.

&lt;a href="w%3AChip%20Reese"&gt;David Edward "Chip" Reese&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; professional &lt;a href="poker"&gt;poker player&lt;/a&gt;, died on December 4, 2007, at the age of 56. Reese died in his sleep at his &lt;a href="Las%20Vegas"&gt;Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Nevada"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt; home from the effects of &lt;a href="w%3Apneumonia"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;.

Reese is generally considered a legend in the world of poker. In 1991, he became the youngest living player to be inducted into the &lt;a href="w%3APoker%20Hall%20of%20Fame"&gt;Poker Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt;. His last major win came at the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20World%20Series%20of%20Poker"&gt;2006 World Series of Poker&lt;/a&gt;, where he won &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;1,784,640 in the &lt;a href="w%3AHORSE"&gt;HORSE&lt;/a&gt; event.

"Chip Reese was probably the most successful poker player in history," said &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Sexton"&gt;Mike Sexton&lt;/a&gt;. "Chip has always been admired by players for his success, his demeanor at the table."

"I knew him for 35 years, I never saw him get mad or raise his voice," &lt;a href="w%3ADoyle%20Brunson"&gt;Doyle Brunson&lt;/a&gt; said. "He had the most even disposition of anyone I've ever met. He's certainly the best poker player that ever lived."

His career spanned multiple decades and Reese made the majority of his money when poker gained publicity through national television exposure starting around the turn of the century. Though he never won the "Main Event" in &lt;a href="w%3ATexas%20hold%20%27em"&gt;Texas hold'em&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Series%20of%20Poker"&gt;World Series of Poker&lt;/a&gt;, Reese was very successful.

"He was a family man like no one else in poker," said fellow poker professional &lt;a href="w%3ABarry%20Greenstein"&gt;Barry Greenstein&lt;/a&gt;. "No matter what the situation was, if his kids had something going on &amp;mdash; a baseball game, a recital, whatever &amp;mdash; he would quit to go to it."

"Probably a lot of us were jealous of him that he was able to do that &amp;mdash; that he had done well enough in poker, that he could always take time off of poker to be involved with his kids,"
Greenstein added.

Reese earned a degree from &lt;a href="w%3ADartmouth%20College"&gt;Dartmouth College&lt;/a&gt; and was accepted to law school at &lt;a href="w%3AStanford%20University"&gt;Stanford University&lt;/a&gt;, but he was drawn by the lure of big winnings and chose instead to earn his living at the poker table. He once told a reporter that law "doesn't have the same monetary incentive as poker."

&lt;a href="w%3ABayern%20Munich"&gt;Bayern Munich&lt;/a&gt; defender &lt;a href="w%3AValerien%20Ismael"&gt;Valerien Ismael&lt;/a&gt; will be leaving Bayern Munich when the transfer window opens on January 1, 2008.

He is set to sign a contract with &lt;a href="w%3AHannover%2096"&gt;Hanover&lt;/a&gt; that will see him playing at AWD Arena until June 2010.

Ismael has seen only 1 game since breaking his leg last season. Bayern Munich coach Ottmar Hitzfeld has been playing Lucio and Martin Demichelis as his top pairing Central Defenders with Daniel Van Buyten as his top reserve defender.

At the &lt;a href="w%3AU.N."&gt;U.N.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20United%20Nations%20Climate%20Change%20Conference"&gt;conference&lt;/a&gt; on Global &lt;a href="w%3AClimate%20change"&gt;Climate change&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ABali"&gt;Bali&lt;/a&gt;, the early talk has focused on whether some of the major &lt;a href="w%3Adeveloped%20countries"&gt;developed countries&lt;/a&gt; will commit to cutting &lt;a href="w%3Agreenhouse%20gas"&gt;greenhouse gas&lt;/a&gt; emissions in the coming years. &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;an states are pushing for steep reductions in emissions, but environmentalists accuse some others of dragging their feet. 

The European Union's climate chief, &lt;a href="w%3AArtur%20Runge%20Metzger"&gt;Artur Runge Metzger&lt;/a&gt;, says his organization wants greenhouse emissions cut by half by the middle of the century.

"We would like to see global average temperatures rise no more than an average of two degrees compared to pre-industrial levels," Metzger said. "And that would require that global emissions go down by at least 50 percent of the 1990 emissions by the year 2050."

Greenhouse emissions are thought to be causing &lt;a href="w%3Aglobal%20warming"&gt;global warming&lt;/a&gt;. Metzger downplayed differences between the EU and other countries on reduction targets, saying he believes the response to the 50 percent proposal has been increasingly positive. He noted that &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; and some members of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Acongress"&gt;congress&lt;/a&gt; have expressed support for the idea.

Those same countries, however, have been targeted by environmental groups, who say they have failed in their initial statements here to come out strongly enough for significant cuts. &lt;a href="w%3AHans%20Verolme"&gt;Hans Verolme&lt;/a&gt; of the group &lt;a href="w%3AWWF"&gt;WWF&lt;/a&gt; says Japan is being criticized for not including binding targets in its proposal for emission control discussions.

"That in our view would be quite disastrous. It would delay action and it would in fact lead to dangerous climate change," Verolme said.

Japan says its proposal is merely an attempt to get the conversation started, and U.N. climate change chief &lt;a href="w%3AYvo%20de%20Boer"&gt;Yvo de Boer&lt;/a&gt; has also sought to downplay any differences. De Boer repeatedly points out that the Bali conference is not meant to produce a new climate-change treaty to replace the &lt;a href="w%3AKyoto%20Protocol"&gt;Kyoto Protocol&lt;/a&gt;. That 1997 agreement is set to expire in 2012.

"This meeting in Bali will not finalize a post-2012 climate change deal, that's much too complicated to do in 10 days, but what it can do is put in place a two-year process to work towards such a deal," De Boer said.

Even the two-degree temperature rise that the European Union talks about is predicted to have serious effects on humans and the environment. The U.N.'s &lt;a href="w%3AIntergovernmental%20Panel%20on%20Climate%20Change"&gt;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change&lt;/a&gt; has predicted such a rise would increase the frequency of damaging storms, and make 30 percent of the world's species more vulnerable to extinction.

Thousands of delegates from more than 180 countries are meeting in Bali, which is due to run through December 14.

&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Darwin"&gt;John Darwin&lt;/a&gt;, a canoeist who has been missing for over five years after disappearing while &lt;a href="w%3Acanoeing"&gt;canoeing&lt;/a&gt; in 2002, has been arrested by &lt;a href="w%3AHampshire%20Police"&gt;Hampshire Police&lt;/a&gt; after walking into a police station in &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AEngland"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;. He is to be charged with fraud in connection with his disappearance in 2002.

It is believed that he has been charged with fraud after a photo of Mr Darwin was released in a tabloid newspaper, the &lt;a href="w%3ADaily%20Mirror"&gt;Daily Mirror&lt;/a&gt;, apparently showing him in Panama with his wife last year. His wife, who recently moved to Central America denies these claims saying that she had claimed the life insurance money and moved as she thought he would never return.

&lt;a href="w%3ADetective%20Superintendent"&gt;Detective Superintendent&lt;/a&gt; Hutchinson, the officer in charge of the case, said that "He was in apparent good health, tanned, well nourished and dressed," when he walked into the West End Central Police station in London four days ago. He also said that the disappearance of Mr Darwin "raised a lot of questions."

A public appeal for information about this incident was launched and it was made clear that the police believe that someone knows what happened to Mr Darwin. Also the police have confirmed that they had recently re-opened the investigation into Mr Darwin's disappearance due to "new evidence" being received.

Mrs Darwin has said that she may struggle to repay the £300,000 she claimed on the life insurance as she has started to spend some of the money.

The weather satellite &lt;a href="w%3AGeostationary%20Operational%20Environmental%20Satellite"&gt;GOES&lt;/a&gt;-12, which provides most of the weather pictures for the United States, became unusable on Tuesday, December 4. The satellite is positioned in &lt;a href="w%3AGeostationary%20orbit"&gt;geostationary orbit&lt;/a&gt; over the &lt;a href="w%3AAmazon"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. A normal &lt;a href="w%3AOrbital%20station-keeping"&gt;station-keeping&lt;/a&gt; maneuver to adjust its location was not completed as usual and services could not be continued.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Oceanic%20and%20Atmospheric%20Administration"&gt;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)&lt;/a&gt; operates the satellites for its &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Weather%20Service"&gt;National Weather Service (NWS)&lt;/a&gt;. NOAA's satellite division intends to attempt Wednesday night to return GOES-12 to normal mode. The satellite is in its "safe" mode, which is used to protect it until problems can be identified and repaired. It is properly oriented toward the Sun so it will have full electrical power for further commands.

The GOES-10 satellite, located slightly further east, has been taken from South American coverage and is providing North American service. GOES-13 is in orbital storage in case it is needed for replacing a failed satellite.

A boy with a rifle opened fire at a busy department store at the &lt;a href="w%3AWestroads%20Mall"&gt;Westroads Mall&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AOmaha%2C%20Nebraska"&gt;Omaha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Nebraska"&gt;Nebraska&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday, killing at least 8 people and injuring five, before taking his own life. The massacre started just before 2 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Time%20Zone%20%28North%20America%29"&gt;CST&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC-6"&gt;UTC-6&lt;/a&gt;). Three of the wounded are in critical condition.

The complex was immediately locked down with people only permitted to leave the immediate mall area, however some people remained in stores and cupboards to avoid the shootings. Police and &lt;a href="w%3ASWAT"&gt;SWAT&lt;/a&gt; teams arrived on the scene within 6 minutes and proceeded into the complex to find the suspect who was pronounced dead at the scene.

"The shooter is male, and has died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound," said an Omaha Police spokesman during a live press conference. Reports also suggest that the suspect was tall and was found on the third floor, though reports conflict as to his exact location. He was thought to be located in the customer service area of the store. Reports later confirmed that almost all if not all of the shootings occurred within the store.

Reports say that the alleged gunman was 19-year-old Robert A. Hawkins from &lt;a href="w%3ABellevue%2C%20Nebraska"&gt;Bellevue&lt;/a&gt;, who left a suicide note in his home stating "I’m going out in style" and "now I'll be famous."
The shooting started near the outside entrance to the &lt;a href="w%3AVon%20Maur"&gt;Von Maur&lt;/a&gt; department store when the man began to open fire with a rifle. The type of assault rifle the man used was one that re-entered the market via the expiration of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban on September 13, 2004. Eyewitnesses suggest that at least 30 shots were fired, with some saying up to 100 shots. Many people, however, thought that it was fireworks or construction noise from nearby works outside the store. Seven people were pronounced dead at the scene and two were pronounced upon arrival at hospitals. 
"We are setting up a station at the Hampton Inn for families and the victims," added the spokesman. The injured are being taken to the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Nebraska%20Medical%20Center"&gt;University of Nebraska Medical Center&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="w%3ASaint_Joseph_Hopital_at_Creighton_University_Medical_Center"&gt;Creighton University Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;.

Police are not releasing names until all family members can be notified.

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASupreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; has heard a plea that terrorism suspects being held at the U.S. &lt;a href="w%3ANavy"&gt;Naval&lt;/a&gt; base at &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20Bay%20Naval%20Base"&gt;Guantánamo Bay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Cuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;, should be given the opportunity to challenge their detention in American courts.

Demonstrators outside the court chanted and waved signs calling on the nine high court justices to grant the detainees &lt;a href="w%3Ahabeus%20corpus"&gt;habeus corpus&lt;/a&gt;, the age-old legal principle that allows prisoners to challenge their detention before a neutral judge. Inside the court, &lt;a href="w%3Aattorney"&gt;attorney&lt;/a&gt; and former &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Solicitor%20General"&gt;US Solicitory General&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASeth%20Waxman"&gt;Seth Waxman&lt;/a&gt; argued on behalf of a group of 37 detainees, part of the 305 prisoners now being held at Guantánamo.

"All have been confined at Guantánamo for almost six years," he said. "Yet, not one has ever had meaningful notice of the factual grounds of detention, or a fair opportunity to dispute those grounds before a neutral decision-maker."

But Waxman appeared to have little success in convincing some of the high court's more conservative justices that the Guantanamo detainees have a constitutional right to challenge their detentions in court. Among the skeptical was Supreme Court Justice &lt;a href="w%3AAntonin%20Scalia"&gt;Antonin Scalia&lt;/a&gt;.

"You are appealing to a common law right that somehow found its way into our Constitution without, as far as I can discern, a single case in which the writ [right] was ever issued to a non-citizen," he said.

Some of the other justices appeared more sympathetic, including Justice &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Breyer"&gt;Stephen Breyer&lt;/a&gt;.

"Now it has been six years, and habeas is supposed to be speedy, and yet people have serious arguments anyway that they are being held for six years without even having those arguments heard," he said.

Since January 2002, more than 750 people have been held. Many of the 305 prisoners at Guantánamo have complained of abuse and almost all have been confined for years without charges. Around 470 other prisoners have been released over the years, and the U.S. said it intends to try 60 to 80 of those currently in detention. 

Since 2002, just three prisoners have been formally charged, and only one has been convicted, as part of a plea bargain. &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Hicks"&gt;David Hicks&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n citizen, who admitted to training with &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;, was repatriated to Australia to serve a nine-month prison sentence.

The Supreme Court ruled against the &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush&lt;/a&gt; administration in two previous cases concerning the legal rights of the Guantánamo detainees. &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Congress"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt; got involved in the issue in 2006 and passed a law that was designed to keep detainee appeals out of the civilian court system and refer them instead to military commissions.

But &lt;a href="w%3Acivil%20rights"&gt;civil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Alegal%20rights"&gt;legal rights&lt;/a&gt; groups say the alternative procedures set up by Congress and the Bush administration deprive the detainees of basic rights.

"At issue here that the Supreme Court decided was; 'Do we have a king in this country who is not bound by the rule of law and not bound by the Constitution? Or do we have a president that is subject to the Constitution?," said Vincent Warren, executive director of the &lt;a href="w%3ACenter%20for%20Constitutional%20Rights"&gt;Center for Constitutional Rights&lt;/a&gt;.

Conservative legal scholars argue against U.S. constitutional protections for foreign terrorist suspects.

"If the courts are going to be in charge of the conduct of warfare, we are going to be a much less safe country," said &lt;a href="w%3AAndrew%20C.%20McCarthy"&gt;Andrew C. McCarthy&lt;/a&gt;, who is with the &lt;a href="w%3AFoundation%20for%20Defense%20of%20Democracies"&gt;Foundation for Defense of Democracies&lt;/a&gt;.

A decision by the Supreme Court in the Guantánamo case is expected before the end of June.

&lt;a href="w%3AKnut%20%28polar%20bear%29"&gt;Knut&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;'s famous &lt;a href="w%3Apolar%20bear"&gt;polar bear&lt;/a&gt;, turned one at the &lt;a href="w%3ABerlin%20Zoo"&gt;Berlin Zoo&lt;/a&gt; yesterday. For the celebration he had a healthy cake with fruits and vegetables, fish and rice on lettuce topped with a candle-shaped rolling pin.

The director of the zoo, Bernhard Blaszkiewitz, said: "I wish Knut that he will get as old as polar bears are supposed to get. So minimum 30 to 40 years, and that he finds a partner." The way he looks and because he comes from Berlin, he will reproduce well, Blaszkiewitz said. Along with this, he referred to the high birth rate in Berlin.

When Knut was born a year ago, he was rejected by his mother Tosca. Keeper Thomas Dörflein took a parental role and reared Knut by hand. After a few months, Knut grew big and Thomas Dörflein could no longer play with him because he received bad bruises. At birth, Knut weighed 1.8 &lt;a href="w%3APound%20%28mass%29"&gt;pounds&lt;/a&gt;, today, he weighs 220 pounds. Adult male polar bears can weigh up to 800 pounds.

Knut was the first polar bear born at the Berlin Zoo in 30 years. Millions of people came to see him from all over the world and the event which was dubbed "Knutmania" spawned a CD, a book and hour-long queues at the zoo.

A 7-year-old girl in &lt;a href="w%3ADetroit%2C%20Michigan"&gt;Detroit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Michigan"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; may have saved her mother's life when she jumped in front of a gunman, who fired six bullets into her body.

Alexis Goggins has been admitted to Children's Hospital of Michigan, where it is said that she is in stable condition. She was shot in an eye, left temple, chin, cheek, chest and right arm.

Despite the daughter's &lt;a href="w%3Aheroism"&gt;heroism&lt;/a&gt;, her mother Selietha Parker, age 30 was shot two times by her ex-boyfriend Calvin Tillie, age 29. One bullet hit the left side of her head and the other hit a &lt;a href="w%3Abiceps"&gt;bicep&lt;/a&gt;.

Tillie has been convicted of at least four other prior crimes and has been dating Mrs. Parker for only six months. Parker called Tillie to see if she and her daughter could stay the night at his home because they were without heat. When Parker arrived at his home, he was on the porch holding a &lt;a href="w%3A9%20mm%20caliber"&gt;9mm caliber&lt;/a&gt; gun and ordered the two back into the car in which they arrived. Tillie said that he wanted to go to a street named &lt;a href="w%3AMile%20Road%20System%20%28Detroit%29"&gt;Six Mile Road&lt;/a&gt;, but Parker said the car needed gas and drove to a gas station where she dialed &lt;a href="w%3A9-1-1"&gt;9-1-1&lt;/a&gt; on her cell phone as she paid the store's attendant.

She then began to slowly walk back to the car and proceeded to pretend that more fuel was needed. When Tillie began to question Parker, he got angry, and began to shoot her. Before Tillie could shoot Parker a second time, Alexis jumped between the two and Tillie then began to shoot her too "without hesitation," according to &lt;a href="w%3ADetroit%20Police%20Department"&gt;Detroit Police&lt;/a&gt;.

Police then arrived on the scene of the crime, with Parker running to officers, covered in both her blood and her child's, saying Tillie shot them both. Tillie was ordered out of the car and dropped the gun, surrendering without resistance.

"[This girl is an] angel from heaven," said a long-time friend of the Goggins' family, Aisha Ford.

Tillie is in jail, pending a hearing on December 13, 2007 in the 36th District Court of Detroit.

For the first time in history, the &lt;a href="w%3ASiemens%20Competition"&gt;Siemens Competition&lt;/a&gt;, formerly the Siemens-Westinghouse Competition, was won by two females. The competition, which along with the &lt;a href="w%3AIntel%20Competition"&gt;Intel Competition&lt;/a&gt; are one of the two most prestigious competitions for high school science research in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. The Siemens Competition has two competitions, one for individual research and the other for team research. For the first time in history both the individual and team awards were won by women. 

Janelle Schlossberger and Amanda Marinoff, students at &lt;a href="w%3APlainview-Old%20Bethpage%20John%20F.%20Kennedy%20High%20School"&gt;Plainview-Old Bethpage John F. Kennedy High School&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3APlainview%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Plainview&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; won the team section of the competition for their work developing a drug that blocks reproduction of tuberculosis bacteria. Meanwhile, Isha Himani Jain from &lt;a href="w%3AFreedom%20High%20School%20%28Pennsylvania%29"&gt;Freedom High School&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Pennsylvania"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; won the individual competition for work involving the bone growth in &lt;a href="w%3AZebra%20fish"&gt;Zebra fish&lt;/a&gt;. Schlossberger and Marinoff will split a $100,000 prize and Himani Jain will also receive a $100,000 prize. Various other students will also receive smaller awards. Many of the other higher-level awards also went to women this year. 

The success of the young ladies was of particular note because historically women have been underrepresented in math and science. The lack of representation has been a matter of heavy political dispute and figured into the departure of &lt;a href="w%3ALarry%20Summers"&gt;Larry Summers&lt;/a&gt; as president of &lt;a href="w%3AHarvard"&gt;Harvard&lt;/a&gt; after he speculated that the lack of representation might be due to innate biological differences. The proportion of scientists who are female has been steadily increasing over the last 50 years. According to James Whaley, the president of the Siemens Foundation, there has been a steady increase in the proportion of students entering the competition who are female and this year 48% of the students entering were female. Many commentators have called the results a sign that the gap between males and females in the sciences is closing or has closed. However, other commentators have said that females will only have reached equality with males in science was when triumphs such as this one are so routine as to not merit headlines.

The Siemens-Westinghouse Competition, now known as the Siemens Competition, was founded in 1998 after &lt;a href="w%3ASiemens"&gt;Siemens&lt;/a&gt; acquired &lt;a href="w%3AWestinghouse"&gt;Westinghouse&lt;/a&gt; but failed to acquire the rights to the Westinghouse competition which instead went to &lt;a href="w%3AIntel"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt; and was renamed the &lt;a href="w%3AIntel%20Science%20Talent%20Search"&gt;Intel Science Talent Search&lt;/a&gt;.

A group of over 200 scientists have signed a document demanding that political action be taken following the scientific evidence that had been put forth in the last International report on climate change. The document, that had been drafted by the &lt;a href="w%3AClimate%20Change%20Research%20Centre"&gt;Climate Change Research Centre&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;University of New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, was presented today at the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20United%20Nations%20Climate%20Change%20Conference"&gt;United Nations Convention on Climate change&lt;/a&gt;, the scientists wanting to give a strong signal to the currently ongoing negotiations. 

Unlike the &lt;a href="w%3AIPCC"&gt;International Panel on Climate Change&lt;/a&gt; (IPCC), which tries to assess the current situation and what the future trends are, the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20United%20Nations%20Climate%20Change%20Conference"&gt;2007 Bali Climate Declaration by Scientists&lt;/a&gt; makes explicit recommendations to policy makers. These are twofold, one regarding the current Conference, and one future goals. On the talks here at &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Bali&lt;/a&gt;, the Declaration says it is necessary that "a new global climate treaty [...] needs to begin in December 2007 and be completed by 2009". It went on to say that "The primary goal of this new regime must be to limit global warming to no more than 2 °C", and that &lt;a href="w%3Agreenhouse%20gas"&gt;emissions&lt;/a&gt; would need to be cut to 40% or less than 2004 levels in order to be able to reach that goal.

Asked by which means these reductions could be achieved, Professor &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Somerville"&gt;Richard Somerville&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; answered that only a combination of technological advances and lifestyle changes would be sufficient to attain the proposed emission levels. 

The declaration, which is only about a page long, and its signatory list can be found at the Climate Change Research Centre's website (see below).

<h1>US Senate Panel approves bill to reduce greenhouse gas emissions</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=US%20Senate%20Panel%20approves%20bill%20to%20reduce%20greenhouse%20gas%20emissions&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; committee has passed landmark legislation aimed at combating &lt;a href="w%3Aglobal%20warming"&gt;global warming&lt;/a&gt; by limiting &lt;a href="w%3ACO2"&gt;carbon dioxide&lt;/a&gt; emissions. The vote was timed to coincide with the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;U.N.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="2007%20United%20Nations%20Climate%20Change%20Conference"&gt;conference on climate change&lt;/a&gt; taking place in &lt;a href="w%3ABali"&gt;Bali&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;. 

The bill would set caps on U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from electric utility, transportation and manufacturing industries beginning in 2012 with the goal of cutting emissions 60 percent by 2050. It would create an incentive system that would give credits to industries that cut pollution. Industries that failed to reduce emissions would be forced to buy credits from others.

The &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Democratic&lt;/a&gt;-led &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Environment%20and%20Public%20Works"&gt;Senate Environment and Public Works Committee&lt;/a&gt; voted eleven to eight, largely along party lines, to send the measure to the full Senate for what supporters hope will be action early next year.

"We are facing a crisis that will hit our children and our grandchildren the hardest if we do not act now. Not to act would be wrong, cowardly, and irresponsible," said &lt;a href="w%3ABarbara%20Boxer"&gt;Senator Barbara Boxer&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;n Democrat, chairwoman of the committee.

Senator Boxer, who is expected to travel to Bali as part of a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Congress"&gt;U.S. congressional&lt;/a&gt; delegation next week, said committee approval of the bill sends a signal to the rest of the world that the United States is serious about reducing global warming.

But many &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republicans&lt;/a&gt; oppose the legislation, saying it would increase energy costs and lead to job losses. They argue the measure does not ensure that other nations, particularly &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, will cut emissions.

"China's emission will continue to accelerate as it builds coal plants and imports jobs from the United States. This will be enormously expensive to households within seven years as electricity prices skyrocket by 35 to 65 percent," said &lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Inhofe"&gt;Senator James Inhofe&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Oklahoma"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;, the top Republican on the committee.

But co-sponsor Republican &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Warner"&gt;Senator John Warner&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Virginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, who broke with many in his party to support the measure, offered a different view: "If we do not act, China and India will hide behind America's skirts of inaction and take no steps of their own. Therefore we simply have to lead," he said.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; has yet to draft its own version of the legislation.

An &lt;a href="w%3AAmtrak"&gt;Amtrak&lt;/a&gt; train collided with a parked &lt;a href="w%3ANorfolk%20Southern%20Railway"&gt;Norfolk Southern&lt;/a&gt; freight train in &lt;a href="Chicago"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt; on Friday. 30 people were injured, five of them Amtrak personnel who were most seriously injured.

Amtrak train 371, the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3APere%20Marquette%20%28passenger%20train%29"&gt;Pere Marquette&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, started in &lt;a href="w%3AGrand%20Rapids"&gt;Grand Rapids&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Michigan"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt; and carried 193 people on board including six crew members. The train was in south Chicago heading towards its destination of &lt;a href="w%3AUnion%20Station%20%28Chicago%29"&gt;Chicago Union Station&lt;/a&gt; when the crash occurred around 17:30 UTC. No injuries were reported among the crew of the Norfolk Southern freight train. Amtrak's locomotive, a &lt;a href="w%3AGE%20Genesis"&gt;GE Genesis&lt;/a&gt;, was derailed by the force of the impact, although the rest of the passenger train remained on the tracks.

All Amtrak trains between Chicago and Michigan are currently cancelled while workers remove the locomotive from the scene and perform any needed repairs. A &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Transportation%20Safety%20Board"&gt;National Transportation Safety Board&lt;/a&gt; "Go Team" led by Ted Turpin was dispatched to the scene to conduct a &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20government"&gt;federal&lt;/a&gt; investigation into the crash.

<h3>Paris Hilton film announces soundtrack</h3>

Lionsgate Films and Twisted Pictures announced the artists on the soundtrack of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ARepo%21%20The%20Genetic%20Opera"&gt;Repo! The Genetic Opera&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, yesterday.

Among those contributing the soundtrack are Richard Patrick (Filter), Steven Perkins (Jane's Addiction), Clown (Slipknot), Ray Luzier (Army of Anyone), Brian Young (David Lee Roth's band), Richard Fortus (Guns &amp; Roses), Sonny Moore (First to Last), David J (Bauhaus/Love &amp; Rockets), Daniel Ash (Love &amp; Rockets), Blasko (Ozzy Osborne), Tommy Clefetus (Rob Zombie's band), Melora Creager (Rasputina). Pop singer Poe is the only solo artist on the album.

The cast, all of whom sing their own songs, includes Anthony Head, Paul Sorvino, Alexa Vega, Sarah Brightman, Bill Moseley and Kevin Ogilvie. Gathering the most headlines for the movie, though, is hotel heiress &lt;a href="w%3AParis%20Hilton"&gt;Paris Hilton&lt;/a&gt;. Hilton's 2006 debut album ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AParis%20%28Paris%20Hilton%20album%29"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reached #6 on the Billboard album chart.

The movie is set in 2056, where organ failures are common. Fictional biotech firm GeneCo offers organ transplants, but those who can't pay up get their parts repossessed.

Before the &lt;a href="w%3AMinistry%20of%20Education%20%28Republic%20of%20China%29"&gt;Ministry of Education&lt;/a&gt; removed the title the "Gate of Great Centrality and Perfect Uprightness" along the &lt;a href="w%3AChiang%20Kai-shek%20Memorial%20Hall"&gt;Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall&lt;/a&gt;, members of the public and politicians from &lt;a href="w%3APan-Green%20Coalition"&gt;Pan-Greens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APan-Blue%20Coalition"&gt;Pan-Blues&lt;/a&gt; battled and demonstrated there, but 5 reporters were hit by a truck near the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Central%20Library"&gt;National Central Library&lt;/a&gt; when they made a SNG live report.

According to witnesses and Chien-chiang Wang from &lt;a href="w%3AFormosa%20TV"&gt;Formosa Television&lt;/a&gt;, they witnessed the driver deliberately stepping on the accelerator after he hit a reporter and braked. Even though the suspect, Sheng-lou Peng was under arrested by the police, he caused the public indignations and was punched by a protester.

Due to the incident, politicians from Pan-Greens and Pan-Blues argued for the responsibilities again. Eventually, a legislative candidate named Feng Mei maliciously said: "It's a show, SO WHAT?!" This behavior without respects on hurt reporters caused outrages from voters from Pan-Greens and Pan-Blues and Mei's neighborhoods.

Politicians from two coalitions like &lt;a href="w%3APremier%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;Premier of the Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AChang%20Chun-hsiung"&gt;Chun-hsiung Chang&lt;/a&gt;, KMT 2008 Presidential Candidate Ying-jeou Ma, Magistrate of &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20County"&gt;Taipei County&lt;/a&gt; Hsi-wei Chou, Minister of the &lt;a href="w%3AGovernment%20Information%20Office"&gt;Government Information Office&lt;/a&gt; Chih-wei Hsieh, and current &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;President of the Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; Shui-bian Chen all criticized on this incident and hoped 5 hurt reporters can recover soon.

After an investigation into the &lt;a href="w%3AChurch%20of%20Scientology"&gt;Church of Scientology&lt;/a&gt; (CoS), top security officials in &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; said that they consider its goals to be in conflict with the &lt;a href="w%3ABasic%20Law%20for%20the%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Germany"&gt;German constitution&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AHamburg"&gt;Hamburg&lt;/a&gt;'s Interior Minister Udo Nagel first brought complaints to state interior ministers in Hamburg. The German Office for the Protection of the Constitution has also been monitoring the group, fearing they may gain control in German elections. In official reports, the government agency has said "There is substantial evidence that the Scientology organization is involved in activities directed against the free democratic order." Nagel has been building support among other interior ministers.
&lt;a href="w%3ABerlin"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;'s Interior Minister, Senator Erhart Koerting, presided over a two-day conference on the issue with the interior ministers of all of Germany's 16 states. Federal Interior Minister, &lt;a href="w%3AWolfgang%20Sch%C3%A4uble"&gt;Wolfgang Schäuble&lt;/a&gt;, also attended. The German government does not believe Scientology is a religion, but instead treats it as a commercial enterprise, and states that it takes advantage of its members. The government taxes the CoS and its sister organizations as businesses in the country.

The interior ministers will ask Germany's domestic intelligence agency to determine what will be necessary in order to ban the CoS in Germany. The organization has been under investigation by the German government for over a decade, under allegations that it "threatens the peaceful democratic order."

Scientologists have said that the investigation is a violation of their freedom of religion, and the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20State"&gt;Department of State&lt;/a&gt; has criticized Germany in its Human Rights Reports in previous years. Sabine Weber, a representative of Scientology in Germany, called the actions to ban Scientology "more than incomprehensible."

This past summer, Germany had initially refused producers of a film starring Scientologist &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Cruise"&gt;Tom Cruise&lt;/a&gt; to film at key sites. Cruise was later able to shoot his film in certain restricted areas.

Many of record store &lt;a href="w%3AHMV%20Group%20plc"&gt;HMV&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; locations have started to stock &lt;a href="w%3AiPod"&gt;iPod&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aportable%20media%20players"&gt;portable music players&lt;/a&gt;, in a move to stay relevant.

HMV Canada President Humphrey Kadaner commented "While the majority of purchased music continues to be in physical form, it's clear the listening experience of many Canadians is evolving to also include portable music and for the majority of those consumers the digital player of choice is the iPod. As the country's leading music retailer, it only makes sense that we provide a full music experience for our customers by selling Canada's leading digital music player."

"Many people think the world of CDs and the world of iPod are incompatible and it just isn't true. Not only are they compatible, they are now cohabitating at many HMV stores across the country. The addition of iPod in HMV stores is another step in HMV's evolution from a music retailer to an entertainment retailer."
In mid-November this year, Canadian chain Music World announced it was closing its stores as of the new year. The franchise has 72 stores across the country, and 648 employees who have been able to keep their jobs during liquidation, which is expected to continue through until Christmas. The store's website now contains nothing but its logo for months.

Previously, the last remaining location of &lt;a href="w%3ASam%20the%20Record%20Man"&gt;Sam the Record Man&lt;/a&gt; closed down, in downtown &lt;a href="Toronto%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt;. Sam once had 130 stores nationwide, then the record. There is a store in Belleville and Sarnia, once part of the chain, but now simply known as "SAM".

The last &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; locations of HMV closed in 2004.

<h1>Climate change talks continue in Bali</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Climate%20change%20talks%20continue%20in%20Bali&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20United%20Nations%20Climate%20Change%20Conference"&gt;United Nations Climate Change Conference&lt;/a&gt; in Bali is nearing its halfway mark. Senior delegates are hopeful an international agreement will be reached on how to control harmful &lt;a href="w%3Agreenhouse%20emissions"&gt;climate emissions&lt;/a&gt; when the &lt;a href="w%3AKyoto%20Protocol"&gt;Kyoto Protocol&lt;/a&gt; expires in 2012, but environmental activists fear the talking is taking too long. 

Delegates in &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Bali&lt;/a&gt; hope to begin drafting a plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions in an effort to contain &lt;a href="w%3Aglobal%20warming"&gt;rising global&lt;/a&gt; temperatures. Many scientists believe the emissions contribute to a rise in global temperatures.

&lt;a href="w%3AYvo%20de%20Boer"&gt;Yvo de Boer&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;' climate change chief, told reporters Friday that over the past two days, the mood at negotiations has been positive.

Asked to provided a concrete example of progress, he said a special working group of delegates has agreed that any future agreement should include ways to encourage countries such as China and India to develop environmentally friendly practices as their industries and economies grow.

"So they've gone into an in-depth discussion on mitigation, and have come to the conclusion that really a strong focus needs to be on putting in place incentives for developing countries to mitigate climate change. That came up very strongly. That, to me at least, is a good indication that the mood is good, people are at work," said de Boer.

But environmentalists have not been as optimistic about progress in this week's negotiations.

Also today the &lt;a href="w%3AGreenpeace"&gt;Greenpeace&lt;/a&gt; ship the &lt;a href="w%3ARainbow%20Warrior"&gt;Rainbow Warrior&lt;/a&gt; arrived in Bali.

Earlier this week, &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; took a position similar to the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; in proposing that any new agreement should favor voluntary emissions targets instead of mandatory ones. The two nations believe that binding emissions caps would threaten the economic growth needed to fund technology used to fight global warming.

&lt;a href="w%3AHans%20Verlome"&gt;Hans Verlome&lt;/a&gt;, director of the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Wildlife%20Fund"&gt;World Wildlife Fund&lt;/a&gt;'s Climate Change Program, urged the U.S., Japan and others to take more decisive action in light of a report from the &lt;a href="w%3AIPCC"&gt;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change&lt;/a&gt; that found global warming is occurring and is likely caused by humans.

"We did not come to Bali to just have another process, and we have two years of talks. It is time to get on with it," said Verlome. "The IPCC report has delivered the results that are necessary to inform decision making, and the decision making is here, now."

Verlome and other environmentalists say &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; has taken a leading role in negotiations this week. China wants wealthy countries to help spread technology for cutting greenhouse gas emissions in poor countries.

&lt;a href="w%3AHarlan%20Watson"&gt;Harlan Watson&lt;/a&gt; of the U.S. delegation reaffirmed his country's opposition to mandatory caps on carbon emissions, but said the U.S. would be open and flexible.

"The U.S. is committed to advancing negotiations, and developing a Bali roadmap, that will guide negotiations on a new post-2012 global climate change regime that is environmentally effective and economically sustainable," he said.

Delegates are on schedule to begin drafting proposals early next week. Environment and trade ministers are scheduled to meet over the next few days.

The &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Acomposer"&gt;composer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AKarlheinz%20Stockhausen"&gt;Karlheinz Stockhausen&lt;/a&gt;, a pioneer of &lt;a href="w%3Aelectronic%20music"&gt;electronic music&lt;/a&gt; among major contemporary musicians, died on December 5. The German foundation, named in his honor, announced today, Stockhausen passed away in his &lt;a href="w%3AK%C3%BCrten"&gt;Kürten&lt;/a&gt; home in &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Rhine-Westphalia"&gt;North Rhine-Westphalia&lt;/a&gt;, Germany.

A prolific composer, he wrote more than 300 works during his career, establishing himself as a pioneer of electronic music, as well as a representative of &lt;a href="w%3Aserialism"&gt;serialism&lt;/a&gt;. ♡❤Studie I♡❤, dated 1953, is considered one of the first electronic music works ever produced. 

Born in &lt;a href="w%3AM%C3%B6drath"&gt;Mödrath&lt;/a&gt;, Germany, in 1927, he was the son of a mother from a wealthy family and a father who was a teacher. He grew up in &lt;a href="w%3AAltenberg%20%28Bergisches%20Land%29"&gt;Altenberg&lt;/a&gt;, where he started taking piano lessons. He studied piano and music pedagogy at the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMusikhochschule"&gt;Musikhochschule&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ in &lt;a href="w%3ACologne"&gt;Cologne&lt;/a&gt;. It was at &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Cologne"&gt;University of Cologne&lt;/a&gt;, he later studied musicology, philosophy and Germanics.

He was influenced by musicians such as &lt;a href="w%3AOliver%20Messiaen"&gt;Oliver Messiaen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AEdgard%20Var%C3%A8se"&gt;Edgard Varèse&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AAnton%20Webern"&gt;Anton Webern&lt;/a&gt;, but also by painters such as &lt;a href="w%3APiet%20Mondrian"&gt;Piet Mondrian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Klee"&gt;Paul Klee&lt;/a&gt;. Stockhausen's works often departed from usual music styles.

During his life as a musician, Stockhausen explored most of the genres and styles. Starting in &lt;a href="w%3Apunctualism"&gt;punctualism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aconcrete%20music"&gt;concrete music&lt;/a&gt; early in his career, during the 1950s, he proceeded to research the electronic music area, which at the time was in an embryonic state. In the 1960s, he composed works of choral music, putting side-by-side the chorus and the use of electronic facilities. In the 1970s, he dedicated himself to serialism. Between 1977 and 2003, he committed himself to one of his most ambitious projects: a cycle of thematic works named ♡❤Licht: Die sieben Tage der Woche♡❤ (♡❤Light: the Seven Days of the Week♡❤).

Various artists have stated that they were influenced by Stokhausen, including artists as varied as &lt;a href="w%3AFrank%20Zappa"&gt;Frank Zappa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABj%C3%B6rk"&gt;Björk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMiles%20Davis"&gt;Miles Davis&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="w%3ARoger%20Waters"&gt;Roger Waters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARick%20Wright"&gt;Rick Wright&lt;/a&gt;&amp;mdash;two of the &lt;a href="w%3APink%20Floyd"&gt;Pink Floyd&lt;/a&gt; members. &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Beatles"&gt;The Beatles&lt;/a&gt; included a portrait of Stockhausen among the people pictured on the cover of their album ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASgt.%20Pepper%27s%20Lonely%20Hearts%20Club%20Band"&gt;Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; singer/songwriter &lt;a href="w%3AFranco%20Battiato"&gt;Franco Battiato&lt;/a&gt; dedicated ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASulle%20corde%20di%20Aries"&gt;Sulle corde di Aries&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ to the composer. 

While being a controversial artist, Stockhausen became a focus of polemics after he stated that the &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%2C%202001%20attacks"&gt;September 11, 2001 attacks&lt;/a&gt; were "works of art". He later explained the meaning of his statements, and said that they had been, according to him, out-of-context and misquoted.

A 146,000 ton oil tanker carrying a crane has collided with a barge named the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AHebei%20Spirit"&gt;Hebei Spirit&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ off the coast of &lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt; spilling more than 10,000 &lt;a href="w%3Ametric%20ton"&gt;metric ton&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href="w%3Aoil"&gt;oil&lt;/a&gt; (1.8 million barrels) into the sea in what is being called the country's worst oil spill. There are no reports of any injuries.

The tanker has suffered at least three large gashes on its &lt;a href="w%3Ahull"&gt;hull&lt;/a&gt; and the spill has since began to wash ashore south of &lt;a href="w%3ASeoul%2C%20South%20Korea"&gt;Seoul&lt;/a&gt;. Residents described the water as all black. Nearly 60 miles (100 kilometers) of shoreline are at risk of being destroyed.

"We are worried about an ecological disaster. We have set up a boom, trying to stop oil from spreading along the coast, but oil sometimes overflows it depending on the currents. If we fail to contain the spread, it is feared (it will) inflict serious damage to the coast," said spokesman for the ministry of maritime affairs and fisheries for S. Korea, &lt;a href="w%3AKim%20Jong-Sik"&gt;Kim Jong-Sik&lt;/a&gt;. 

He also stressed that the spill has not yet caused any damage which "will depend on how the sea currents move in coming hours. We have 40 vessels out there fighting the oil spill."

Emergency workers in the region of &lt;a href="w%3ATaean"&gt;Taean&lt;/a&gt; are fighting to stop the oil slick, which is over 20km (12 miles) long.

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="United%20States%20Congress"&gt;Congressional&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt; are asking the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Justice%20Department"&gt;Justice Department&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to investigate whether the &lt;a href="CIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt;'s destruction of videotapes documenting the interrogation of terrorism suspects amounts to obstruction of justice. 

The acknowledgement by Central Intelligence Agency Director &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Hayden"&gt;Michael Hayden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that his agency destroyed the interrogation videotapes in 2005 sparked a firestorm of criticism among Congressional Democrats. They suggested the tapes could have provided key evidence in ongoing trials brought by terrorism suspects who are alleging they were tortured.

Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATed%20Kennedy"&gt;Ted Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a Massachusetts Democrat, said, "What would cause the CIA to take this action? The answer is obvious - cover up. The agency was desperate to cover up damning evidence of their practices."

&lt;a href="Human%20Rights%20Watch"&gt;Human Rights Watch&lt;/a&gt;'s Senior Counterterrorism Counsel commented to Google news saying, "The CIA was well aware that its interrogations crossed a line considered by many to be torture. Now some in the CIA may also be guilty of obstruction of justice as well - a serious felony that carries a possible 20 year sentence. There needs to be a serious criminal investigation, and those who have committed crimes should be prosecuted and convicted."

The Democratic chairmen of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20and%20Senate%20Intelligence%20Committee"&gt;House and Senate Intelligence Committees&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are vowing to investigate, and other Democrats are calling on the Justice Department to do the same.

"You cannot destroy material if there is an ongoing investigation. There is a law against it," said Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACarl%20Levin"&gt;Carl Levin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of Michigan, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.

At the &lt;a href="US%20White%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;, spokeswoman &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADana%20Perino"&gt;Dana Perino&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; only learned of the matter two days ago, after he was briefed by CIA Director Hayden.

"He has no recollection of being made aware of the tapes or their destruction before yesterday," said Perino.

Perino defended the CIA &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ainterrogation"&gt;interrogation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; program as legal and critical to national security. She said President Bush supports General Hayden's explanation that the tapes were destroyed to protect the identities of the interrogators.

But the Senate's number two Democrat, Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADick%20Durbin"&gt;Dick Durbin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of Illinois, rejected that argument:

"The defence of the CIA is that they wanted to protect the identity of those CIA employees who were engaged in the interrogation," said Durbin. "Mr. [Senate] President, that is not a credible defence. We know that it is possible, in fact, easy, to cover the identity and faces of those who were involved in any videotape. Something more was involved here."

The tapes, which documented the use of tough interrogation techniques against key terror suspects in 2002, were destroyed three years later, at a time when there was increasing pressure from defence lawyers to obtain videotapes of detainee interrogations and as Congress had been probing allegations of torture.

The Bush administration has maintained it does not use torture, but refuses to say what techniques are used by intelligence agencies in interrogations of terror suspects.

&lt;a href="Finland"&gt;Finnish&lt;/a&gt; theatrical &lt;a href="w%3Ahard%20rock"&gt;hard rock&lt;/a&gt; band &lt;a href="Lordi"&gt;Lordi&lt;/a&gt; have released ♡❤Beast Loose in Paradise♡❤ - which will be the soundtrack to the band's upcoming horror movie ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ADark%20Floors"&gt;Dark Floors&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ - as a downloadable single.

The song was originally intended to be released via Zed.fi, but for unknown reasons has not appeared on the site. However, it has appeared on at least two other sites as a pay-to-download single - &lt;a href="w%3AMSN%20Music"&gt;MSN Music&lt;/a&gt; Finland and &lt;a href="w%3AMTV3"&gt;MTV3&lt;/a&gt;.fi.

The song was one of two recorded last month, and will be released by &lt;a href="w%3ASony%20BMG"&gt;Sony BMG&lt;/a&gt; Finland as an actual CD on January 8 . The other song, titled ♡❤Studs and Leather♡❤, was also written for the movie.

The cover art for the CD single has already been revealed. It is a direct tribute to the &lt;a href="w%3AKiss%20%28band%29"&gt;KISS&lt;/a&gt; album ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACreatures%20of%20the%20Night"&gt;Creatures of the Night&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

Most of both songs were composed during Lordi's tour of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; as part of &lt;a href="w%3AOzzfest"&gt;Ozzfest&lt;/a&gt;, with the band's lead vocalist saying in an interview with MonsterDiscoHell.com that the main riff of ♡❤Beast Loose in Paradise♡❤ was written in &lt;a href="w%3AMilwaukee"&gt;Milwaukee&lt;/a&gt;, while the chorus of ♡❤Studs and Leather♡❤ was composed in &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Augustine"&gt;St. Augustine&lt;/a&gt;. 

He went on to say that ♡❤Studs and Leather♡❤ had originally been intended for ♡❤Bend over and Pray the Lord!♡❤, an unreleased album from 1999 that had been intended to be Lordi's debut. The verses from ♡❤Beast Loose in Paradise♡❤ had been decided on between the whole band during therapy sessions at Christmas 2006. He said that he had written most of the rest between two US tours, the Ozzfest tour and a tour as the support act for &lt;a href="America"&gt;America&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href="w%3Agothic%20doom%20metal"&gt;gothic doom metal&lt;/a&gt; band &lt;a href="w%3AType%20O%20Negative"&gt;Type O Negative&lt;/a&gt;.

He continued to deny a recent rumour posted in Finnish music periodical ♡❤Soundi♡❤ that the new material was going to be "more brutal and raw" than that on Lordi's last album, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Arockalypse"&gt;The Arockalypse&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. "Our music is not gonna get any brutal or heavier, but not any lighter [either]... I'd say these two songs are familiar Lordi. Although ♡❤Beast Loose in Paradise♡❤ is more 'movie-esque' and 'horror-ish' on purpose. And some might say it's even heavier, but at the very least the chorus will be familiar and melodic Lordi stuff. And ♡❤Studs and Leather♡❤ is basically ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AHeaven%27s%20on%20Fire"&gt;Heaven's on Fire&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ (KISS song) meets ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABalls%20to%20the%20Wall%23Title%20track"&gt;Balls To The Wall&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ (&lt;a href="w%3AAccept"&gt;Accept&lt;/a&gt; song).

Delegates at the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20United%20Nations%20Climate%20Change%20Conference"&gt;United Nations Climate Change Conference&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; are wrestling with a proposal that would allow developing nations to earn billions of &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Dollar"&gt;dollars&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href="w%3Acarbon%20trading"&gt;carbon trading&lt;/a&gt; by leaving idle forests such as those in &lt;a href="w%3ABorneo"&gt;Borneo&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AAmazon%20rainforest"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACongo"&gt;Congo&lt;/a&gt; basins. 

The news comes on the same day that it was announced that forest clearance in the Amazon Rainforest was falling compared to previous years.

Delegates from about 190 countries are negotiating a plan for private companies and wealthy nations to pay poorer nations to keep their forest intact. It is called the &lt;a href="w%3AReduced%20Emissions%20from%20Deforestation%20in%20Developing%20Countries"&gt;Reduced Emissions from Deforestation in Developing Countries&lt;/a&gt;, or REDD proposal.

Environmental scientists say tree cutting in tropical areas accounts for about 20 percent of all man-made &lt;a href="w%3ACO2"&gt;carbon dioxide emissions&lt;/a&gt; blamed for &lt;a href="w%3Aglobal%20warming"&gt;global warming&lt;/a&gt;. Tropical forests soak up vast amounts of carbon dioxide; burning timber to clear land releases it.

Marcelo Furtado with &lt;a href="w%3AGreenpeace"&gt;Greenpeace&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Brazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; says the REDD plan is needed to fill gaps in the current &lt;a href="w%3AKyoto%20Protocol"&gt;Kyoto Protocol&lt;/a&gt;, an international agreement to limit emissions of &lt;a href="w%3Agreenhouse%20gases"&gt;greenhouse gases&lt;/a&gt; which does not include ways to preserve forests.

"We would like to see, at the very least, a REDD mechanism moving forward, because we want to see countries taking action now. We don't want to wait to 2013 to start seeing this action taking place. And this is something this convention, this group of countries could deliver," said Furtado.

Frances Seymour, Director General for the Indonesia-based Center for International Forest Research, is concerned a premature REDD agreement could do more harm than good.

"Because in many forested countries, land tenure rights to forest lands and resources are either unclear or contested or both. And you can imagine that if a potential new income stream is available for those who can present themselves as owners of the forest, this could create conflict and create conditions under which some of the world's poorest people, who are people who live in forests, could be pushed aside," said Seymour.

Financial analysts are also cautious about the proposal.

Charlotte Streck, the director of &lt;a href="w%3AClimate%20Focus"&gt;Climate Focus&lt;/a&gt;, a Rotterdam-based consultancy, said investors are worried about how governments would monitor their forests and ensure the carbon stored in them remains intact.

"This is what makes the private sector nervous, because these are risks that they cannot hedge properly, and that they cannot evaluate in the same manner as the project related risks," she said.

Conference delegates are still debating how to monitor the world's remaining tropical forests, how to stop logging in one place without shifting the problem to another area, and how to estimate the amount of carbon in a piece of land.

Yvo de Boer, the U.N.'s climate change chief, said a REDD agreement is unlikely during this conference, but a group working on the details is making significant progress.

&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Express%20East%20Coast"&gt;National Express East Coast&lt;/a&gt; has begun operating intercity rail services on the &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Coast%20Main%20Line"&gt;East Coast Main Line&lt;/a&gt; connecting &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; with the north-east of &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Scotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; after it was awarded the franchise earlier this year. &lt;a href="w%3AGNER"&gt;GNER&lt;/a&gt;, the previous operator, had their contract terminated early when parent company &lt;a href="w%3ASea%20Containers%20Ltd"&gt;Sea Containers Ltd&lt;/a&gt; encountered financial difficulties.

GNER could not afford to pay the &lt;a href="w%3APound%20sterling"&gt;£&lt;/a&gt;1.3 billion premium it had promised the government, and whilst National Express have promised £1.4 billion, the larger contributions are scheduled for towards the end of the franchise when revenues should be better as increases in capacity and the estimated growth in rail travel take effect.

The new operator, part of the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Express%20Group"&gt;National Express Group&lt;/a&gt;, has committed to making an number of improvements to the service as part of the franchise contract. One of the first changes for passengers travelling today will be that the on-board &lt;a href="w%3Awireless%20internet"&gt;wireless internet&lt;/a&gt; service is now free for all passengers. 

Elsewhere on the UK railway network, today also saw &lt;a href="w%3ATransPennine%20Express"&gt;TransPennine Express&lt;/a&gt; begin services from &lt;a href="w%3AManchester"&gt;Manchester&lt;/a&gt; to Edinburgh and &lt;a href="w%3AGlasgow"&gt;Glasgow&lt;/a&gt; after a change in the Cross Country franchise saw the services leaving &lt;a href="w%3AVirgin%20Trains"&gt;Virgin Trains&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>Sean Penn endorses Kucinich for US President</h1>

Academy Award winning actor and political activist &lt;a href="w%3ASean%20Penn"&gt;Sean Penn&lt;/a&gt; has just thrown his support in the 2008 US Presidential election behind 
&lt;a href="w%3ADennis%20Kucinich"&gt;Dennis Kucinich&lt;/a&gt;.

In a San Francisco speech described by his PR people as "a blistering indictment of political leaders and an impassioned endorsement of Presidential proportions," Penn threw his support behind the lesser known Democratic candidate.

The Kucinich campaign did not vet the speech.

Other recent celebrity endorsements in the race include Oprah Winfrey for Barack Obama, Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling for John McCain, Harry Belafonte endorsed John Edwards, and both 50 Cent and Barbra Streisand behind Hillary Clinton. Chuck Norris has backed Mike Huckabee in a high profile, comedic endorsement ad.

Penn first became politically active in October 2002, when he spent $56,000 on a full-page ad in the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20Post"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, asking President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; to end "a cycle of violence". He visited Iraq briefly in December of that year, Iran in 2005 as a journalist, and met with Venezuelan president &lt;a href="w%3AHugo%20Ch%C3%A1vez"&gt;Hugo Chávez&lt;/a&gt; for two hours in 2007.

Penn went to New Orleans to "aid rescue workers" after &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt;; many questioned how much of a liability an untrained worker, especially when his boat sprang a leak, would be. One website commented "just showed up with his entourage and a personal photographer with the apparent intent of just wandering around looking for a good photo op."

The &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Africa-EU%20Summit"&gt;summit&lt;/a&gt; of more than 70 &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;n and &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;an Union nations has opened in &lt;a href="Portugal"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt; with an acknowledgement that conflicts, &lt;a href="w%3Ahuman%20rights"&gt;human rights&lt;/a&gt; violations and &lt;a href="w%3Apoverty"&gt;poverty&lt;/a&gt; continue to pose challenges. Portuguese Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJose%20Socrates"&gt;Jose Socrates&lt;/a&gt; opened the summit on today, calling it a meeting of equals in a community of nations that shares a historic duty.

The Portuguese leader promised a frank and open discussion with no taboos. This was seen as a reference to issues such as conflicts and human rights violations in Africa as well as historical injustices in Euro-African relations.

The chairman of the African Union, &lt;a href="Ghana"&gt;Ghana&lt;/a&gt;'s President &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Kuofor"&gt;John Kuofor&lt;/a&gt;, said the relationship between Africa and Europe during the past 500 years has been unhappy, characterized by the &lt;a href="w%3Aslave%20trade"&gt;slave trade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Acolonies"&gt;colonialism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aapartheid"&gt;apartheid&lt;/a&gt;. He said a new relationship is needed to correct what he called a historic inhumanity.

"The real significance of the Africa-EU summit must therefore be to lay the foundations of a new partnership based on mutual respect and a genuine commitment to pursue the mutual interests of our two continents," he said.

The leaders are to establish a new strategic partnership with eight priority areas. These include peace and security, governance and human rights, economic development, environmental degradation, migration and trade.

The President of the African Union Commission, &lt;a href="w%3AAlpha%20Oumar%20Konare"&gt;Alpha Oumar Konare&lt;/a&gt;, said the relationship must avoid charity, paternalism and false promises.

He says no one will solve Africa's ills for it. Africa must play the game of &lt;a href="w%3Aglobalization"&gt;globalization&lt;/a&gt; but not unilateral globalization based solely on market forces. Konare said the new partnership must develop ways to address this issue.

Efforts to hold the Africa-EU summit have been thwarted for the past five years by a dispute over &lt;a href="w%3AZimbabwe"&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt;'s human rights record. President &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Mugabe"&gt;Robert Mugabe&lt;/a&gt;'s invitation this year prompted a boycott by Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AGordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt;, Zimbabwe's former colonial ruler.

Human rights activists have protested that summit leaders are ignoring suffering and oppression on the continent. And opponents of globalization said the summit's approach to boosting trade would aggravate poverty.

European leaders have been intent on holding the meeting because of competition for Africa's markets coming from &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; and other emerging nations.

<h1>UK firemen cut metal ring from man's penis</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=UK%20firemen%20cut%20metal%20ring%20from%20man%27s%20penis&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Fire fighters in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; used a hand grinder to remove a metal ring from a man's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Apenis"&gt;penis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 2 days ago. They had been summoned after doctors at the Royal Wigan Infirmary in &lt;a href="Greater%20Manchester"&gt;Greater Manchester&lt;/a&gt; became worried that the man may have required &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aamputation"&gt;amputation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the penis as the ring was cutting off the blood flow.

The man had been taken to the infirmary's Accident and Emergency department, where attempts were made to cut through the ring. However, this failed as hospital cutting equipment was not strong enough to sever the hard metal the ring was made of.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGreater%20Manchester%20Fire%20and%20Rescue%20Service"&gt;Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; responded to the call made at around 12.10 GMT Thursday, after the penis started swelling up. Two fire fighters spent twenty minutes cutting the ring off the then &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aanaesthetic"&gt;anaesthetised&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; man, who is in his 40s. The mini hand grinder used for the job is more regularly used for tasks such as cutting through padlocks.

A thin sheet of metal was placed around the man's penis to protect it during the operation. It is thought that the ring had originally been cut off the end of a pipe.
