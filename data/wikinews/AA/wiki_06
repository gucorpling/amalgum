&lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; will lend &lt;a href="w%3AAlbania"&gt;Albania&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aeuro"&gt;€&lt;/a&gt;16.7 million (&lt;a href="w%3AUSD"&gt;USD&lt;/a&gt;21.5 million) as part of a loan in order to help the country improve its water supply networks in two southeastern towns, &lt;a href="w%3APogradec"&gt;Pogradec&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AKorca"&gt;Korca&lt;/a&gt;. The deal was signed last Tuesday between the Albanian Finance Ministry and Germany's government-owned KfW Bank.

Germany has been one of the most significant donors to Albania since the fall of Communism. In total, it has contributed more than €326 million to the country's development, while investing €135 million in its water supply and urban canals. 80% of this has been given through grants.

The &lt;a href="Mars"&gt;Mars&lt;/a&gt; Rover &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMER%20B"&gt;MER B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , better known as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOpportunity%20rover"&gt;Opportunity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , is stuck in a sand dune about 30 centimeters tall in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMeridiani%20Plunum"&gt;Meridiani Plunum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The Rover had just discovered a pair of tiny craters when its six wheels got stuck in the dune and the Rover stopped dead.

Opportunity ground control is now taking its time getting Opportunity free. They also want to discover what is so different about this soil so that this kind of event may be avoided in the future.

"A note to all you Opportunity fans: Get used to the current scenery, because we’re going to be here awhile," Steve Squyres, lead scientist on the Rover team at &lt;a href="Cornell%20University"&gt;Cornell University&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIthaca%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Ithaca&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; wrote in his &lt;a href="http%3A//www.marsdaily.com/"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;. "We are very optimistic that we’ll be able to get out of here, but we’re really going to take our time doing it." Squyres also noted: "We've gotten dug in before and gotten out just fine, so this isn't cause for immediate concern."

Opportunity is one of two rovers (along with its twin Spirit, which landed on Mars on 3 January 2004) designed to explore the surface of Mars and radio back data to Earth. Squyres promises to keep the public updated of any changes through his blog.

According to an &lt;a href="w%3ATNS%20NIPO"&gt;TNS NIPO&lt;/a&gt; survey published today, a 68% majority of the Dutch agrees with the position that the &lt;a href="w%3ABalkenende"&gt;Balkenende&lt;/a&gt; government is behaving itself as the "lap dog" ("♡❤schoothondje♡❤") of the United States.

The survey also stated 79% find that &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush&lt;/a&gt; overly pressures other countries to become and stay allies to the US. Over 70% agreed &lt;a href="w%3AEurope"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; should attempt to counterbalance the US, while 56% of the participants in the survey agree that Bush is a danger for world peace.

The survey was released the night before a Bush visit to the Netherlands.

<h1>United States begins testing equipment for demolition of a major VX nerve gas stockpile</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=United%20States%20begins%20testing%20equipment%20for%20demolition%20of%20a%20major%20VX%20nerve%20gas%20stockpile&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Testing began on a chemical reactor at the &lt;a href="w%3ANewport%20Chemical%20Depot"&gt;Newport Chemical Depot&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href="w%3ATerre%20Haute%2C%20Indiana"&gt;Terre Haute, Indiana&lt;/a&gt; on Friday morning. If successful, the reactor will be put to use destroying the large &lt;a href="w%3AVX"&gt;VX nerve gas&lt;/a&gt; stockpiles stored at the facility over the course of the next two years. 
After the disposal project experienced several delays, the facility announced it would begin pumping VX into a completed disposal unit for testing. The unit consists of a chemical reactor in which the VX will be mixed with water and &lt;a href="w%3Asodium%20hydroxide"&gt;sodium hydroxide&lt;/a&gt;, heated to 194°&lt;a href="w%3AFahrenheit"&gt;F&lt;/a&gt; while mixed with paddles. The resulting chemical, called &lt;a href="w%3AHydration%20reaction"&gt;hydrolysate&lt;/a&gt;, is chemically similar to commercial drain cleaners and has similar properties. If the test is successfully completed , the unit will continue processing the VX until the entire stockpile has been neutralized, a process projected to take two years. Administrators expect to complete testing on May 10, 2005.
According to the controversial plan, the finished waste product would be shipped to &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Jersey"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; for final reprocessing. The inert chemical would then be emptied into the &lt;a href="w%3ADelaware%20River"&gt;Delaware River&lt;/a&gt; where natural &lt;a href="w%3Aattenuation"&gt;attenuation&lt;/a&gt; would occur. 

Residents near the proposed river disposal site in New Jersey oppose this idea. The contractor for the final component of this disposal would be the &lt;a href="w%3ADuPont"&gt;DuPont Corporation&lt;/a&gt;.

<h4>Background on Newport Chemical Depot (NCD)</h4>
NCD is a bulk chemical storage and destruction facility in west central Indiana, thirty miles north of Terre Haute. Originally founded during World War II to produce &lt;a href="w%3ACyclotrimethylene%20trinitramine"&gt;RDX&lt;/a&gt;, a conventional explosive, it later became a site for chemical weapons manufacturing during the &lt;a href="w%3ACold%20War"&gt;Cold War&lt;/a&gt;. It is now used to securely store and gradually neutralize part of the US stockpile of VX. 

VX was manufactured by the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; in the 1950s and 60's as a deterrent to possible &lt;a href="w%3ASoviet%20Union"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; use. It was never deployed, and the manufacture was halted in 1969 after an order signed by then-president &lt;a href="w%3Arichard%20m.%20nixon"&gt;Richard Nixon&lt;/a&gt;.

In 1999, the Army announced it awarded a disposal contract to Parsons Infrastructure &amp; Technology, Inc., a business unit of Parsons Corporation. Some 220 civilian Parsons employees work at the facility, which is supervised by an Army officer reporting to the U.S. Army Chemical Materials Agency, and a board of civilian government overseers called the Indiana Citizens' Advisory Commission, some of whose members are appointed by the state governor.

Security at the facility is controversial. A private security service, supplemented by a complement of Indiana National Guard soldiers, guarded the facility until April 14, 2005, when the soldiers were withdrawn. An Indianapolis television station has questioned security measures in some of its special reports.

At the same time, the ♡❤♡1♡❤♡ skips other stops, which are only served by the ♡❤♡9♡❤♡ at rush hours; some stops are served by all trains. This service pattern results in slightly faster trains, but longer waits for those going to or from skipped stations.

♡❤♡9♡❤♡ service was started on December 12, 1988, at first running during rush hours and middays. In the mid-1990s, midday ♡❤♡9♡❤♡ service was dropped.

The ♡❤♡&lt;a href="w%3AJ-Z%20%28New%20York%20City%20Subway%20service%29"&gt;J-Z&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ skip-stop services on the &lt;a href="w%3ABMT%20Jamaica%20Line"&gt;BMT Jamaica Line&lt;/a&gt; will not be affected, as many passengers ride straight through the skip-stop portion, making the faster service more worthwhile.

The 131st run for the roses in &lt;a href="w%3ALouisville%2C%20Kentucky"&gt;Louisville, KY&lt;/a&gt; is set for Saturday at &lt;a href="w%3AChurchill%20Downs"&gt;Churchill Downs&lt;/a&gt;. Post time is 6:04pm &lt;a href="w%3AEDT"&gt;EDT&lt;/a&gt; under what should be partly sunny skies and a fast track. The 20-horse field contains 10 strong contenders in what promises to be a fast pace out front in the &lt;a href="w%3AKentucky%20Derby"&gt;Kentucky Derby&lt;/a&gt;.

Trainer Nick Zito, the 2-time derby winner boasts 5 stable horses running the race, and has the odds-on favorite ♡❤♡♡❤Bellamy Road♡❤♡♡❤. The &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Steinbrenner"&gt;George Steinbrenner&lt;/a&gt; owned horse won convincingly in 4 of its last 5 trips. At its #16 post position, it will have to get out quickly, or be on the outside going into the first turn where it would have to fight for position. Given the early starting speed of ♡❤♡♡❤Spanish Chestnut♡❤♡♡❤, it seems unlikely that any horse will easily set the pace.

Showing strong closing in its last 4 races is ♡❤♡♡❤Bandini♡❤♡♡❤, ridden by top &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; jockey John Velazquez, a 6-time Breeder's Cup winner. If this horse can hold onto the pace, watch for him at the finish line.

For today's 1 ¼ mile race, Jeremy Rose on ♡❤♡♡❤Afleet Alex♡❤♡♡❤ looks dangerous, where both horse and jockey are experienced. But it was ♡❤♡♡❤Wilko♡❤♡♡❤ who prevailed in their meeting at the Breeders' Cup Juvenile last October.

A &lt;a href="w%3AChicago%20Tribune"&gt;♡❤Chicago Tribune♡❤&lt;/a&gt; computer analysis predicts a win for ♡❤♡♡❤High Fly♡❤♡♡❤, based on its “lack of flaws”. In that prediction they note criteria on which it was calculated, but nothing accounts for the race day excitement of roaring crowds in these 3-year-old thoroughbreds.

Last year the jammed Churchill Downs drew 140,000 people on a rainy Saturday to watch &lt;a href="w%3ASmarty%20Jones"&gt;♡❤♡♡❤Smarty Jones♡❤♡♡❤&lt;/a&gt; win. The Derby run is the first leg in &lt;a href="w%3AUSA"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt; horse racing's &lt;a href="w%3ATriple%20Crown%20of%20Thoroughbred%20Racing"&gt;Triple Crown&lt;/a&gt;. The last horse to win the triple crown was &lt;a href="w%3AAffirmed"&gt;♡❤♡♡❤Affirmed♡❤♡♡❤&lt;/a&gt; in 1978.

<h1>British supermarket Tesco wants to start a film downloading service</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=British%20supermarket%20Tesco%20wants%20to%20start%20a%20film%20downloading%20service&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The world's third largest supermarket chain, &lt;a href="w%3ATesco"&gt;Tesco&lt;/a&gt; of Britain, announced intentions to start a film downloading service on the back of its successful music download service in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;.

Tesco takes a 10% share in the UK music download market, even though they are a late comer.

The reason for the service is that Britain is one of the largest illegal downloaders of film and television programmes in the world, with many TV shows copied to &lt;a href="w%3APersonal%20computer"&gt;PCs&lt;/a&gt; as soon as they are shown in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. Copies of &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Simpsons"&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20O.C."&gt;The O.C.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADesperate%20Housewives"&gt;Desperate Housewives&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href="w%3ALost%20%282004%20television%20series%29"&gt;Lost&lt;/a&gt; which is not available yet in the UK are found on &lt;a href="w%3APeer-to-peer"&gt;p2p&lt;/a&gt; servers like &lt;a href="w%3AKazaa"&gt;Kazaa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABitTorrent"&gt;BitTorrent&lt;/a&gt;.

This is not the first company who has decided to start a film download service. The entertainment giant &lt;a href="w%3ASony"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt; has asked for such a service, plus the music downloader &lt;a href="w%3AWippet"&gt;Wippet&lt;/a&gt; has already decided to introduce film downloading in the UK.

In a surprise result, the leader of the &lt;a href="w%3AUlster%20Unionist%20Party"&gt;Ulster Unionist Party&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Trimble"&gt;David Trimble&lt;/a&gt;, has lost his seat in the &lt;a href="UK%20general%20election%2C%202005"&gt;UK general election&lt;/a&gt;. Beaten with a margin of over 5,000 votes by his opponent David Simpson of the &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Unionist%20Party"&gt;Democratic Unionist Party&lt;/a&gt;, Trimble resigned.

&lt;a href="w%3AUpper%20Bann%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29"&gt;Upper Bann&lt;/a&gt; was one of four seats lost by the UUP lost in the 2005 General Election, the others being &lt;a href="w%3ALagan%20Valley%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29"&gt;Lagan Valley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Antrim%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29"&gt;South Antrim&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Antrim%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29"&gt;East Antrim&lt;/a&gt;.

David Simpson of the DUP said that his victory in Upper Bann "sends out a very, very clear signal that push-over unionism has gone forever".

San Jose law enforcement officials picked up Ayala from the &lt;a href="w%3AClark%20County%2C%20Nevada"&gt;Clark County&lt;/a&gt; Detention Center in Las Vegas at about 6:00 a.m. local time on Friday, and transported her to San Jose, arriving at 1:30 p.m local time.

"Obviously, we can't discuss the logistics as to how she was brought here but she was brought in and booked into the Santa Clara County jail without incident," San Jose Policy Officer Enrique Garcia told ♡❤Knight Ridder♡❤.

<h3>Arraignment next week</h3>
Ayala will likely be arraigned on Monday or Tuesday at the &lt;a href="w%3ASanta%20Clara%20County"&gt;Santa Clara County&lt;/a&gt; Superior Court, according to Santa Clara County Deputy District Attorney David Boyd.

"We can now move forward," Boyd told the ♡❤San Francisco Chronicle♡❤. "We are ready to go on all our cases. We don’t just go arrest people for fun."

"I’m very happy about the fact that she's back," Ayala's attorney Rick Ehler told the ♡❤San Francisco Chronicle♡❤. "It gives us the opportunity to look at the discovery material the prosecution is compelled to provide us and now we can move forward to prove her innocence."

"The press has treated this like she's Hannibal Lecter in `Silence of the Lambs," Ayala's sister, Mary, told ♡❤Knight Ridder♡❤ on Friday. "She's a normal human being who's innocent," Ayala's sister said. "I just want to know what the evidence is. What could it be? She's innocent."

Ayala's sister asked for support from the public next week, and has purchased T-shirts with the words "We Support Anna Ayala".

Ayala's bail stands at US$500,000. She could be sentenced to serve up to seven years in jail if she is found guilty of faking the chili finger incident.

In order to save the lives of seabirds, the government of &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; has ordered the recall from sub-Antarctic waters of the entire fleet of New Zealand's 35 &lt;a href="w%3Asquid"&gt;squid&lt;/a&gt; fishing boats. Once at port, the boats are to take on independent observers to ensure that they follow codes of practice. Violators of the new rules face a fine of up to NZ$100,000.

Fisheries Minister David Benson-Pope said that "blatant bad behaviour" on the part of the boats, flouting a voluntary code of practice set up a year ago, demanded immediate action. 

An Air Force aeroplane was sent on a tour of inspection last month. Benson-Pope reported that observations from the inspection revealed that, contrary to the agreed code of practice:

<ul>
BULLET::::- 46% of the fishing fleet were not using equipment to scare sea birds away from vessels, with a further 8% only using it intermittently.
BULLET::::- 30% of the fishing fleet were discharging offal (which attracts seabirds) while trawling or hauling nets, with a further 25% doing so intermittently.
BULLET::::- Only 30% of the fishing fleet actually complied with both mitigation and offal management requirements.

</ul>
Mr Benson-Pope referred to a voluntary code of practice adopted in the &lt;a href="w%3ATuna"&gt;tuna&lt;/a&gt; fishing industry which he said had reduced death of seabirds by 95%.

India's recently launched satellites, the 1560 kg Indian Remote Sensing satellite, CARTOSAT-1 for stereoscopic cartographic applications and 42.5 kg HAMSAT will have a longer life as per the Project Director, PSLV, N Narayana Murthy.

Murthy told reporters that the additional fuel in the satellites for putting them into the right orbit can now be utilized for orbit maintenance maneuvers. This is due to their precise injection into the orbit by the PSLV-C6 Launcher.

PSLV-C6 was launched by Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) on May 5, 2005 10:15 IST (May 05, 04:45 UT). PSLV-C6 placed both the satellites in polar Sun Synchronous Orbit (SSO) at an altitude of 632 x 621 km with an inclination of 97.8 deg with respect to the equator. The solar panels of CARTOSAT-1 were deployed soon after its injection into orbit.

CARTOSAT-1 is the eleventh satellite in the Indian remote sensing satellite series and is intended for cartographic applications. It carries two panchromatic cameras that take black-and-white stereoscopic pictures in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum.

HAMSAT is a Micro-satellite for providing satellite based Amateur Radio services to the Indian as well as International community of Amateur Radio Operators (HAM).

The American &lt;a href="w%3Atheme%20park"&gt;theme park&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADisneyland"&gt;Disneyland&lt;/a&gt; celebrated its &lt;a href="w%3AHappiest%20Homecoming%20on%20Earth"&gt;golden anniversary&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday, in &lt;a href="w%3AAnaheim%2C%20California"&gt;Anaheim, California&lt;/a&gt;.

The theme park, created and opened by &lt;a href="w%3AWalt%20Disney"&gt;Walt Disney&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3A1955"&gt;1955&lt;/a&gt;, hosted a special gala opening at 1pm in front of &lt;a href="w%3ASleeping%20Beauty%20Castle"&gt;Sleeping Beauty Castle&lt;/a&gt;, the world-famous icon of Disneyland.

CEO of &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Walt%20Disney%20Company"&gt;the Walt Disney Company&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Eisner"&gt;Michael Eisner&lt;/a&gt;, COO &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Iger"&gt;Bob Iger&lt;/a&gt;, honorary Disneyland Ambassador &lt;a href="w%3AJulie%20Andrews"&gt;Julie Andrews&lt;/a&gt; and a host of stars opened the celebration, which is scheduled to run for eighteen months.

Singers &lt;a href="w%3AChristina%20Aguilera"&gt;Christina Aguilera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALeAnn%20Rimes"&gt;LeAnn Rimes&lt;/a&gt; sang Disney classics, while actors &lt;a href="w%3ATim%20Allen"&gt;Tim Allen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Martin"&gt;Steve Martin&lt;/a&gt; opened new attractions. Martin had worked at Disneyland as a teenager, and Aguilera was part of the &lt;a href="w%3AMickey%20Mouse%20Club"&gt;Mickey Mouse Club&lt;/a&gt; in the 1980s.

Within &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, Disney is calling it the ♡❤Happiest Homecoming on Earth♡❤, and worldwide it is known as the ♡❤Happiest Celebration on Earth♡❤. Several attractions have been swapped between parks, and the four main Disney theme parks (the &lt;a href="w%3AMagic%20Kingdom"&gt;Magic Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATokyo%20Disneyland"&gt;Tokyo Disneyland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADisneyland%20Paris"&gt;Disneyland Paris&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AHong%20Kong%20Disneyland"&gt;Hong Kong Disneyland&lt;/a&gt;) gave a salute to Disneyland via live satellite feed.

The ceremony was hit with deep purple stormclouds but no rain. 

The park celebrates its actual birthday on July 17, 2005. There are no clear details on how Disney will mark the occasion.

Members of a &lt;a href="w%3AWaynesville%2C%20North%20Carolina"&gt;Waynesville, North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; Baptist church voted to kick out nine members, including a deacon, who disagreed with the political views of its main pastor, Chan Chandler. 

In a special meeting Monday night, Chandler asked congregants of the East Waynesville Baptist Church who voted for &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Kerry"&gt;John Kerry&lt;/a&gt; in the last U.S. presidential election to either repent that action or leave the room. Afterward he called for a vote to remove the nine people who left the meeting from the church's membership. All but two remaining members attending the meeting voted to remove the nine dissenters.

Later 40 additional church members, who had not attended the Monday meeting, resigned from the church in protest of Chandler's action.

According to the Baptist State Convention of North Carolina in an interview with the ♡❤Asheville Citizen-Times♡❤, the local newspaper, each church has local bylaws and East Waynesville may have had authority to do such a purge if the bylaws allowed for it.

Even so, according to reports by the Associated Press, the North Carolina Democratic Party claims Chandler may be endangering his church's tax-free status. U.S. laws prohibit charities, including churches, from taking sides in the political arena. 

A loss of tax-free status would bar congregants of the church from writing off tithes as charitable contributions on their income tax statements. Additionally, the church may have to pay taxes on the money it receives from the collection plate.

<h1>Mars rover engineers build test sandbox</h1>

Mars rover engineers have built a test bed simulating the condition of the Mars Rover Opportunity, which became stuck in a Martian sand dune on April 26. The test bed uses a combination of materials including play sand for children's sandboxes, diatomaceous earth for swimming pool filters, and mortar clay powder.

Opportunity dug into soft sand to wheel-hub depth as it drove over a dune about one-third meter (one foot) tall and 2.5 meters (8 feet) wide. "We've climbed over dozens of ripples, but this one is different in that it seems to be a little taller and to have a steeper slope, about 15 degrees on part of its face," said Mark Maimone, a &lt;a href="w%3AJet%20Propulsion%20Laboratory"&gt;Jet Propulsion Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; (JPL) rover mobility engineer. Tests will be conducted using an Earth-bound twin of the rover and the simulated Martian dune to determine how to best maneuver Opportunity out of the predicament before transmitting commands to the actual vehicle.
"We choose to proceed cautiously, so we don't expect to begin actually driving out of the dune before next week, possibly later," said Jim Erickson, rover project manager at JPL. "Both Opportunity and Spirit have already provided many more months of scientific exploration than anyone expected. By taking good care of them, we hope to keep them exploring for more months to come. Tests so far have sustained our optimism about Opportunity's ability to drive out of this dune, but we have more testing ahead to understand how robust that capability is."

Engineers constructed a simulated dune last week using sand that was already at JPL's rover testing facility and put a test rover into a similar dug-in position. The test rover had no difficulty driving away, even when sunk belly-deep. However, that sand offered better traction than the finer, looser material that appears to make up the surface at Opportunity's current position. "We needed to do tests using material more like what Opportunity is in, something that has a fluffier texture and cakes onto the wheels," said JPL rover engineer Rick Welch, who is leading the tests.

Based on images of wheels and wheel tracks from Mars, Dr. Robert Sullivan of Cornell University, a rover science team member, working with engineers in the JPL test bed, helped match the properties of the test sand as closely as possible with those of the sand beneath Opportunity, "We found that when the wheels dig in, the material we're using does stick to the wheels and fills the gaps between the cleats, but it doesn't stick when you're just driving over it. That's good because it's the same as what we see in the images from Opportunity," Sullivan said. Experiments show that the test rover, after some initial wheel-spinning, can drive out of the more powdery material. 

The team went to several home supply and hardware stores to find enough bags and boxes of the ingredients to make more than 2 tons of the simulated Mars sand for the more realistic mobility tests, according to JPL rover mobility engineer Jeff Biesiadeckia.

Protesters gathered in Amsterdam, Maastricht, and several other cities in &lt;a href="w%3AHolland"&gt;The Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; to protest a visit by the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; President, &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;. As many as 2,000 people gathered in Amsterdam's Museum Square, voicing their discontent with the war in Iraq.

Many protesters consider Bush personally responsible for the torture in &lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Ghraib"&gt;Abu Ghraib&lt;/a&gt; prison and human rights violations in &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20Bay"&gt;Guantanamo Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Their arguments are based on documentary evidence such as the &lt;a href="w%3AFBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; email showing that Bush directly ordered what might be described as torture (hoods, sleep deprivation) &lt;a href="http%3A//www.aclu.org/SafeandFree/SafeandFree.cfm%3FID%3D17216%26amp%3Bc%3D206"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. A large number of protesters carried signs that read "George W. Bush: Warcriminal." More than 150 people attended a demonstration in Maastricht, many going to Beek Airport to give Bush an unpleasant and noisy welcome.

Access to &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, including its other projects, was abruptly interrupted late Saturday when a &lt;a href="w%3ADNS"&gt;DNS&lt;/a&gt; outage caused the search engine giant to be unreachable by the domain ♡❤♡Google.com♡❤♡. &lt;a href="http%3A//labs.google.com"&gt;Google Labs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http%3A//www.google.com/maps"&gt;Google Maps&lt;/a&gt;, as well as products of Google such as the &lt;a href="w%3AWeblog"&gt;blogging&lt;/a&gt; service &lt;a href="w%3ABlogger"&gt;Blogger&lt;/a&gt; and free photo-album software &lt;a href="w%3APicasa"&gt;Picasa&lt;/a&gt;, were unaffected. Google.com and its &lt;a href="w%3Asubdomain"&gt;subdomains&lt;/a&gt; were once again functioning as of 0100 UTC.

During the brief outage, some browsers were redirected to SoGoSearch. The site http://www.google.com.net has a link to &lt;a href="http%3A//www.mnema.com/"&gt;Gigantics&lt;/a&gt;, and normally redirects to SoGoSearch. This is probably a procedure that specific browsers implement when they cannot find the proper address. Others were also reported to be redirected to &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AMSN"&gt;MSN Search&lt;/a&gt;.

Barbobot reports the DNS may have been stolen for a short time.

In the recent UK general election, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACraig%20Murray"&gt;Craig Murray&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; stood as candidate against &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJack%20Straw"&gt;Jack Straw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABlackburn"&gt;Blackburn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; constituency. Murray was attempting to bring about public debate and public knowledge of Straw's alleged complicity in Uzbek &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; torture. Straw retained his seat with 17,562 votes (42%), while Murray came fifth with 2,082 votes (5%).

Craig Murray was British Ambassador to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUzbekistan"&gt;Uzbekistan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 2002 and 2003. A career diplomat, Murray had a good record of success behind him, but was withdrawn from Uzbekistan after he publicly decried the widespread use of torture in that country. He was quoted in the ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFinancial%20Times"&gt;Financial Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ as claiming the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASecret%20Intelligence%20Service"&gt;MI6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; used intelligence gained by the Uzbek authorities by torture. 

The &lt;a href="Foreign%20and%20Commonwealth%20Office"&gt;Foreign and Commonwealth Office&lt;/a&gt; (FCO) stated at the time that "It's now felt it's no longer possible Mr. Murray can do his job effectively so he's been withdrawn." Mr. Murray was receiving medical treatment at the time for on-going ill health, including a near-fatal pulmonary embolism. He had previously been flown to London after collapsing during a medical check in Uzbekistan.

Craig Murray's campaign website says, "A vote for Jack Straw is a vote for torture. Jack Straw expressly agreed that MI6 should use intelligence material obtained under torture, in tyrannical regimes like Uzbekistan."

Two months before the UK election &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChannel%204"&gt;Channel Four&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; premiered the program &lt;a href="http%3A//www.channel4.com/news/microsites/T/torture/cases.html"&gt;"Torture:The Dirty Business"&lt;/a&gt; which showed that the Uzbekistan government routinely uses torture to interrogate prisoners. It showed that CIA had sent prisoners to that country to be tortured in a procedure known as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Arendition"&gt;rendition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The program alleged that UK's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMI5"&gt;MI5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; received information obtained by torture. The FCO released a statement to the program claiming that they would never do anything to encourage torture, but that it would be "irresponsible" to rule out the use of any information received from a foreign government if such information could help protect British citizens. In the same program Craig Murray stated that after he raised objections to the use of information extracted under torture, his superiors informed him that Jack Straw had personally authorised the policy.

According to the program, confessions from tortured prisoners that suggested a link between Iraq and Al Qaeda could have contributed towards the case built by the government for going to war in Iraq. Information extracted under torture is known to be unreliable because prisoners can be coerced to say anything.

Craig Murray's Blackburn campaign received widespread media attention around the world, although coverage was more limited in the UK (see below for links to some articles covering the Craig Murray campaign).

Saturday's running of the &lt;a href="w%3AKentucky%20Derby"&gt;Kentucky Derby&lt;/a&gt; left favorites in dry churned up dust, as speedster ♡❤♡♡❤Spanish Chestnut♡❤♡♡❤ forced an early pace that only long-shot horses fully answered. The two top finishers, ♡❤♡♡❤Giacomo♡❤♡♡❤ and ♡❤♡♡❤Closing Argument♡❤♡♡❤ ran past race favorites ♡❤♡♡❤Bellamy Road♡❤♡♡❤ and hopeful ♡❤♡♡❤Bandini♡❤♡♡❤, who came off the starting gate well and into the first turn. But they faded under a blistering early pace that at the half-mile pole was second fastest in race history.

Only ♡❤♡♡❤Afleet Alex♡❤♡♡❤, showing at third, applied salve to the wounded crowd of 154,000 ticket-tearing fans. Betting for this year's race totaled a record $103.3 million counting both on- and off-track wagering. A 2 &lt;a href="w%3ADollar"&gt;dollar&lt;/a&gt; wager on the winning horse ♡❤♡♡❤Giacomo♡❤♡♡❤ paid $102.60.

TV viewership in top metropolitan markets was down only slightly from the previous year, which considering the wagering shows no lack of interest in the race:

<h1>Romanian Humanist Party changes name to Conservative Party</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Romanian%20Humanist%20Party%20changes%20name%20to%20Conservative%20Party&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3ARomanian%20Humanist%20Party"&gt;Romanian Humanist Party&lt;/a&gt; has voted to change its name to the Conservative Party (♡❤Partidul Conservator♡❤, or PC). During its congress, a resolution was also passed for the party to join the &lt;a href="w%3AEPP-ED"&gt;European People's Party-European Democrats&lt;/a&gt; group in the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Parliament"&gt;European Parliament&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="%3Aw%3ADan%20Voiculescu"&gt;Dan Voiculescu&lt;/a&gt; suggested the change of name, blaming the party's moderate doctrine for its poor election results. Voiculescu said he studied several political doctrines and has found that the &lt;a href="w%3AHumanism"&gt;Humanist&lt;/a&gt; ideology has much in common with the &lt;a href="w%3AConservatism"&gt;Conservative&lt;/a&gt; ideology, including an emphasis on &lt;a href="w%3Afree%20market"&gt;free market&lt;/a&gt; economics as a key means of achieving social welfare. Other elements of the Conservative Party's ideology include a reduction in state intervention in the economy and private property, as well as the importance of traditional values such as the family, army and church, and national values and ethics. The party's new slogan is "Make a stand, Romanian!"

The Conservative Party is currently part of the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AJustice%20and%20Truth"&gt;Justice and Truth&lt;/a&gt; governing coalition, even though it is generally regarded as the most controversial party in the coalition. This is because its policies and stance on key issues are generally against that of the other coalition parties, especially the National Liberal Party and the Democratic Party. For example, the Humanist Party was the only party in the governing coalition to call for the withdrawal of troops from Iraq, and it has been accused of allying with whatever party is in power, regardless of its ideology.

Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ACalin%20Popescu-Tariceanu"&gt;Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu&lt;/a&gt;, from the Liberal Party, attended the congress. He said to the Conservatives that they should treat sensitive issues such as the situation in Iraq with more responsibility and diplomacy inside the governing coalition, in order to not give the impression of "dysfunction".

The Humanists' name change is the third change of name by a Romanian party this year. The Christian-Democratic National Peasants' Party has changed its name to the &lt;a href="w%3AChristian-Democratic%20People%27s%20Party"&gt;Christian-Democratic People's Party&lt;/a&gt;, and the Great Romania Party has changed its name to the &lt;a href="w%3APopular%20Great%20Romania%20Party"&gt;Popular Great Romania Party&lt;/a&gt;.

At the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASellafield"&gt;Sellafield&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; reprocessing plant, a leak in the process was spotted on April 19. The leak did not cause danger to people or the environment but it disturbed the normal operation of the plant.

Workers at the plant noticed a discrepancy in the amount of material being reprocessed that enters pipes that lead to a set of centrifuges and the amount of material actually arriving at the centrifuges. They used remote cameras to find the crack where the material was escaping; over twenty tonnes have leaked into a steel lined chamber.

The material, consisting of mostly uranium and some plutonium dissolved in nitric acid, would have been reprocessed in the centrifuges. The large stainless steel chamber that now contains the spilled material is too dangerous to enter due to radioactivity, though it poses no danger to those inside or outside the plant.

The plant has been shut down pending repairs.

<h2>Background</h2>

The Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant, or THORP, recycles spent nuclear fuel from British &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAGR"&gt;AGR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APWR"&gt;PWR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; reactors. (Another plant reprocesses fuel from Britain's older &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMagnox"&gt;Magnox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; reactors). &lt;a href="Nuclear%20reprocessing"&gt;Nuclear fuel reprocessing&lt;/a&gt; recycles spent nuclear fuel, greatly reducing the amount of waste. The process is technically complicated and there is a political debate on its safety. Since the price of nuclear fuel is presently low, fuel produced by THORP has had problems competing in the market. Furthermore THORP has encountered some technical problems lately. There is discussion whether THORP should be allowed to continue in operation.

Sellafield is also the site of, amongst other things, a decommissioned &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Anuclear%20power%20plant"&gt;nuclear power plant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Previously the site has also been the scene of the 1957 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWindscale%20fire"&gt;Windscale fire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the most severe nuclear accident on British soil.

On February 17, 2005, the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; Atomic Energy Authority reported 29.6 kg of plutonium was unaccounted for during audits at the facility. However, this is an error of 0.5%, and the &lt;a href="IAEA"&gt;IAEA&lt;/a&gt; allows a 1% error to allow for, e.g., mistakes on paper.

Today the 60th anniversary of &lt;a href="w%3AVictory%20Day"&gt;Victory Day&lt;/a&gt; was commemorated in &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, and other successor states of the &lt;a href="w%3ASoviet%20Union"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;.

The parade on &lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Square"&gt;Red Square&lt;/a&gt; started at 7:00 UTC. The leaders of more than 50 countries and heads of several international organisations attended the parade. &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; watched the parade with Russian President &lt;a href="w%3AVladimir%20Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt;.

Others attending included:
<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="Hu%20Jintao"&gt;Hu Jintao&lt;/a&gt; - General Secretary of the Communist Party of China
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="w%3AKofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt; - Secretary General of the United Nations

BULLET::::- &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AJacques%20Chirac"&gt;Jacques Chirac&lt;/a&gt; - President of the French Republic

</ul>
More than 4,000 &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20War%20II"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; veterans and 7,000 military personnel were involved in the parade. The culmination was the flight of 12 planes (made up of &lt;a href="w%3ASU-25"&gt;SU-25&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href="w%3AMIG-29"&gt;MIG-29&lt;/a&gt;s), which emitted white, blue and red smoke to paint a Russian flag in the air.

Average Moscow citizens were not allowed to the parade. The exits from several metropolitan stations were closed. Mass celebrations are planned to be held at &lt;a href="w%3APoklonnaya%20Gora"&gt;Poklonnaya Gora&lt;/a&gt;, Moscow's primary WW2 memorial.

Several new monuments were opened today, such as the 8-meter statue of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ACharles%20de%20Gaulle"&gt;Charles de Gaulle&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AZurab%20Tsereteli"&gt;Zurab Tsereteli&lt;/a&gt; and the monument to soldiers from Allied countries.

In the evening there was a large fireworks display.

The 60th anniversary of &lt;a href="w%3AVictory%20in%20Europe%20Day"&gt;Victory in Europe (VE) Day&lt;/a&gt; was commemorated across Europe yesterday.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; military reports 75 militants dead in an offensive launched Sunday in western &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. The offensive was begun with U.S. air support in a desert area north of the &lt;a href="w%3A%20Euphrates"&gt;Euphrates River&lt;/a&gt; in the province of &lt;a href="w%3AAnbar"&gt;Anbar&lt;/a&gt;. There is no word on civilian casualties, if any.

A report by a ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3A%20Chicago%20Tribune"&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ journalist embedded with U.S. forces said the offensive "was seeking to uproot a persistent insurgency in an area that American intelligence indicated has become a haven for foreign fighters flowing in from Syria."

More than 1,000 U.S. and coalition troops supported by fighter jets and helicopter gunships attacked villages in and around Al Qaim, near the &lt;a href="w%3ASyria"&gt;Syrian&lt;/a&gt; border. A statement by the US military said the operation was expected to last several days, and was targeting a smuggling route and hideouts for foreign rebels.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Forces%20Press%20Service"&gt;♡❤American Forces Press Service♡❤&lt;/a&gt; reports: "Coalition forces also destroyed car bombs, bomb-making material and two buildings that contained large weapons caches to include hand- and rocket-propelled grenades."

The ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Times"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reports an estimate of insurgent casualties at over 100. 

Col. Bob Chase, the chief of operations for the Second Marine Division, has said there were "a handful" of marine casualties. The source also reports Chase saying, "The objective is to totally disrupt the safe havens and rat lines that have allowed them to bring those materials across the border. This had been a very secure area for the insurgents."

In a statement made from an &lt;a href="w%3AIslam"&gt;Islamist&lt;/a&gt; website that could not be confirmed, the &lt;a href="w%3AAl-Qaeda"&gt;Al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; militant &lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Musab%20al-Zarqawi"&gt;Abu Musab al-Zarqawi&lt;/a&gt; reportedly said, "The adorers of the cross claim to have killed 75 Muslims at Al-Qaim. Once more, they are lying, because lying is their religion," according to &lt;a href="w%3AForbes"&gt;Forbes&lt;/a&gt;.

Workers at &lt;a href="w%3ANewport%20Chemical%20Depot"&gt;Newport Chemical Depot&lt;/a&gt; in Indiana have completed a successful test-run of a chemical reactor designed to dispose of &lt;a href="w%3ACold%20War"&gt;Cold War&lt;/a&gt; stockpiles of &lt;a href="w%3AVX"&gt;VX nerve agent&lt;/a&gt;.

After encountering initial difficulties when the temperature in the reactor grew too high, workers were able to adjust the speed of the device. 180 gallons of VX and water were turned into a caustic but far less lethal compound, that can be further reprocessed into an inert substance. 

A residue of 14 parts VX per billion remained; the Army's eventual goal is less than 20 parts. One drop of VX can kill a grown man.

The conversion of the VX stockpiled at the facility is projected to take two years. Then the drain cleaner-like waste product with its small residue of VX will need to be sent to another facility for reprocessing into a safer, biodegradable compound. 

A controversial plan has &lt;a href="w%3ADuPont"&gt;Dupont&lt;/a&gt; doing the reprocessing at their facility in New Jersey, and dumping the compound into the nearby &lt;a href="w%3ADelaware%20River"&gt;Delaware River&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>Ruling Liberals of British Columbia attack opposition in election campaign</h1>
♡❤♡, ♡❤♡ 
With a less than an impressive outcome from the Leadership Debate, the ruling &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Columbia%20Liberal%20Party"&gt;British Columbia Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt; came out with a very aggressive strategy over the weekend, stalking the campaign of rival &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20British%20Columbia"&gt;New Democratic Party of British Columbia&lt;/a&gt; (NDP).

In a clear shift of tactics away from promoting their economic record as deserving a second term in office, the &lt;a href="w%3AGordon%20Campbell"&gt;Gordon Campbell&lt;/a&gt; campaign told voters in Mission that an NDP government would be a return to the days of premier &lt;a href="w%3AGlen%20Clark"&gt;Glen Clark&lt;/a&gt;, who led the province during an economic downturn. "Do you really want the old Glen Clark gang back in the cabinet room?" Campbell asked a crowd of supporters.

A radio debate had all three candidates before the voters again, but without the open debate format which seemed to give Campbell difficulty in the televised debate. Working to support Green leader &lt;a href="w%3AAdrienne%20Carr"&gt;Adrienne Carr's&lt;/a&gt; attacks on NDP leader &lt;a href="w%3ACarole%20James"&gt;Carole James&lt;/a&gt;, Campbell's strategy was likely to split the more liberal voters.

James and the NDP have responded that the Liberals must be feeling nervous, or frustrated, since they've abandoned campaigning on their record in favour of a negative campaign. "I think we've struck a chord. He's trying to fight the 2001 election. I'm making sure that the voters have an opportunity to look at his record."

<h3>Background</h3>

The province of &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Columbia"&gt;British Columbia&lt;/a&gt; will hold general elections May 17, 2005.

The ruling Liberal party swept into office in 2001, winning 77 of 79 legislative ridings and forming their first government since 1953.

Craig Newmark, the founder of &lt;a href="w%3Acraigslist"&gt;craigslist.org&lt;/a&gt;, is fascinated with the idea of community journalism.

According to the ♡❤Associated Press♡❤, Newmark is interested in an 'open source' approach to journalism, allowing a huge team of volunteer journalists to stand up to their mainstream counterparts. By acting as news gatherers, writers, and desk editors, Newmark envisions the rise of a regularly updated "trustworthy" outlet that can inform voters ahead of the United States midterm elections in 2006.

Although plans are currently only on the horizon, Newmark has discussed project ideas with Dan Gillmor, a former technology columnist at the ♡❤San Jose Mercury News♡❤ and founder of Grassroots Media Inc., and Jeff Jarvis, a former critic for TV Guide and People. Newmark explained: "People are looking for attitude and guts in reporting not full-on gonzo journalism, but hey, tell us what you think."

The collaborative approach to news reporting that Newmark describes is already, in one way, very much alive today in the form of Wikinews: volunteer writers from around the globe can contribute articles, gather news, fact check and review each other's work. A spokesperson for craigslist confirmed that Newmark is "very familiar" with Wikipedia, the sister project to Wikinews.

Confirming that his advisers had been in contact with the Wikimedia Foundation, Newmark himself told us earlier today: "I'm very aware of Wikinews, and I really like the idea."

Denunciations of corruption, bribe, collection of bribes from refugees &lt;a href="http%3A//www.estadao.com.br/agestado/noticias/2002/jan/25/114.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and of sexual scandal involving the peacekeepers &lt;a href="http%3A//www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0%2C%2C3-1413501%2C00.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http%3A//news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4379971.stm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; threaten the Organization of the United Nations (UN).

The gravest denunciations involve the aid project to &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, called &lt;a href="w%3AOil%20for%20Food"&gt;Oil-for-Food&lt;/a&gt;.

Even the secretary of the UN, &lt;a href="w%3AKofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt; was suspicious of participation in the plan of corruption. And also grave doubts still hover about his son, Kojo Annan.

The gravity of the denunciations threatens not only the credibility of the UN, but its existence.

Secretary Kofi Annan said that he is going to promote reforms in the organization. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.voanews.com/english/2005-03-24-voa7.cfm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

<h2>The Oil-for-Food Program</h2>
 The ♡❤♡The Oil-for-Food Program♡❤♡ was established by the &lt;a href="w%3AUN"&gt;Organization of the United Nations&lt;/a&gt; in 1996 for permit that the &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; sold oil for the world market in change of food, medicines and others humane worthy supplies. 

The declared intention of the program was to help the Iraqi government guarantee the basic needs of the common Iraqi citizens, injured by imposed, international economic sanctions to the government in the mat of the first one &lt;a href="w%3AGulf%20War"&gt;Gulf War&lt;/a&gt;, after the Iraq invaded the Kuwait in August of 1990, however, without permission that the country reconstructed its military forces. 

The Iraq refused the program in the beginning but afterwards signed a memo in May of 1996 for its implementation. It programs him By By began in October of 1997, and the first delivers arrived in March of 1998. 

It programs By By used a trustee deposit system, by which the money of the sale of the oil of the Iraq I to be paid by the buyer in a not accessible bill straightly by the Iraqi government. Of this money, a part served for pay indenizações by mischief caused to the &lt;a href="w%3AKuwait"&gt;Kuwait&lt;/a&gt;, and another one breaks era for help in the payment of the expense of the forces of the coalition and others expense of the United Nation with the Iraq. The remaining money remained in the bill. 

The Iraqi government had permission of buy merchandise that were not prohibited by the program and debit the corresponding values of that bill. The purchase of certain itens, as alimentary kinds, to be rushed, and the corresponding merchandise attended to immediately. Most of the itens, inclusive simple things as pencil and acid fólico, to be investigated, in a trial that typically led around six months, before of him I am going to be permitted. The itens considerados as subject to application in biological, chemical weapons, and nuclear, as well as itens whose delivers to would lead a long time, were refused, does not import to justificativa given for her requests. 

Approximately 60 percent of the 26 millions of inhabitants of the Iraq depended only of the feeds of sustenance of him programs By By. Provisions in the value moved closer to $27 billion destined for humane help were entregues to the Iraq. 

More of OR$65 billions in Iraqi oil were sold in the world market. Around US$46 billions were used for guarantee the humane needs of the Iraqis, with food, medicines and others itens of humane help. A total of 25 percent, from December of 2000, was spent with the repairs by the War of the Gulf by means of a bottom of compensation; 2,2 percent were operational and administrative expense of the United Nations with the program; and 0.8 percent were expense with the weapons inspection program. 

A short while before of the United States of the America and the British forces will invade the Iraq, the Secretary of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, suspended the program and evacuated more of 300 staffs that controlled the distribution of the provisions. 

In the day 28 of March of 2003, the Secretary Annan, the United States of the America, and the Great Britain asked to the &lt;a href="w%3AConselho%20of%20Security%20of%20the%20Security%20United"&gt;Advice Nations of the United Nations&lt;/a&gt; for assure that approximately US$10 billions in merchandise for the Iraq, that already had been ordered and approved, including US$2,4 billions in food, could be introduced in the country when the conditions permitted. Others US$2,1 millions would be left for cover other needs of emergency of the civil Iraqis. 

The authorities of the UN estimate that 350 thousand refugees would be benefited, with property that would go since tents for shelter, to sustenances. The resolution in argument cleared that the main responsibility by the humane consequences of the war would fall under the United States of the America and Great Britain, case they took the control of the country, second the Wednesday Convention of Genebra of 1949, about the responsibilities of the forces of occupation. 

The program formally enclosed his activities in 21 of November of 2003, and most of the deep was put under the control of the Coalition of Provisional Authority. 

Many they supported the program of intentions alegadamente humane, in the hope of that he of fact helped the Iraqis. Some other persons criticked the program, in private after the fall of the regimen of Saddam Hussein, under the argument of that Saddam took advantage of the profits obtained by the sale of oil for maintain itself através of a plan of corruption that implicava staffs of several governments and of the UN. 

&lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; defended the expansion of the program.

<h2>Reclamações</h2>

Entre as orientações do programa, estava uma que dizia que as receitas da venda do petróleo deveriam ser divididas de modo a proteger as regiões predominantemente curdas do Iraque. Contudo, os &lt;a href="w%3ACurdist%C3%A3o"&gt;curdos&lt;/a&gt; queixaram-se, desde a data de início do programa, de que eles não recebiam essas receitas adequadamente.

Houve alegações de que o escritório no Cairo da &lt;a href="w%3AOrganiza%C3%A7%C3%A3o%20Mundial%20da%20Sa%C3%BAde"&gt;Organização Mundial da Saúde&lt;/a&gt;, foi dirigido por um indivíduo que supostamente recebeu contratos de venda de petróleo, para em troca, paralisar a construção de um novo hospital geral para a cidade curda de Sulaymaniyah, embora os fundos para a construção desse hospital estivessem disponíveis desde 1988.

A partir de Abril de 2004 &lt;a href="http%3A//www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/week_2004_04_25.php%23002900"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, o programa começou a ser alvo de acusações dos círculos conservadores norte-americanos, de que parte do dinheiro era ilegalmente desviada para o governo iraquiano. Foram feitas acusações de que parte do dinheiro era usada para subornar funcionários da ONU e até mesmo o secretário-geral Kofi Annan.

Segundo o relatório liberado no dia 3 de Fevereiro de 2005, pela comissão de investigação liderada por Paul Volckers , o ex-presidente do Fed, Banco Central dos EUA, a maior parte dos alimentos fornecidos pelo programa "era inadequada para o consumo humano". Peter van Walsum, atualmente embaixador aposentado dos &lt;a href="w%3APa%C3%ADses%20Baixos"&gt;Países Baixos&lt;/a&gt; para as Nações Unidas e presidente do comitê de sanções do Iraque 1999-2000, especulou num livro recente que o Iraque deliberadamente dividiu o conselho de segurança concedendo contratos à França, &lt;a href="w%3AR%C3%BAssia"&gt;Rússia&lt;/a&gt;, e &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, mas não ao &lt;a href="w%3AReino%20Unido"&gt;Reino Unido&lt;/a&gt; e aos Estados Unidos da América. Ele também afirmou que ele encontrou um número de casos nos quais sentia que a falta da cooperação iraquiana tinha o objetivo propositado de exacerbar o sofrimento da sua própria gente. Ele também disse que, em sua opinião, as sanções não eram uma alternativa eficaz.

Benon Sevan, do &lt;a href="w%3AChipre"&gt;Chipre&lt;/a&gt;, comandou o programa Petróleo-por-comida, e com convicção o defendeu. Ele disse que o programa teve só um custo administrativo de 2,2 %, que passou por mais de 100 revisões (internas e externas), e culpou as restrições do Conselho de Segurança por ter dificultado a situação. Ele também disse que 90 % da população de Iraque confiava no programa de entrega mensal da cesta de alimentos.

<h2>Al-Mada</h2>

On January 25, 2004, ♡❤Al-Mada♡❤, a daily newspaper of the Iraq, published a &lt;a href="http%3A//memri.org/bin/articles.cgi%3FPage%3Darchives%26amp%3BArea%3Dia%26amp%3BID%3DIA16404"&gt;list of 270 individuals and organizations&lt;/a&gt; of several countries that would have received contracts of sale of oil by intermediary of the Oil-for-Food Program of the UN. The list based itself in more of 15,000 documents that supposedly were found in the corporation of Iraqi state-owned oil, to which had connections with the Department of the Oil of Iraq. 

The Department of the Oil headed by ally Ahmed Chalabi, ex-member of the advice of government, that had been in the past widely critiqued until by his ex-apoiadores, by supply to the U.S.A. false information during the war. The possible envolvement of Chalabi and to not possibility of corroborate the evidences put in doubt the accuracy of the list al-Mada. 

In the list of beneficiários of the al-Mada were the member of the British parliament, George Galloway, and to his entity of charity, the Bottom of Mariam; the ex-minister of the French interior Charles Pasqua, and the sheikh al-Kaffaji, a man of Iraqi business, that contributed with OR$400 thousand for produce a film that discredited the researches of weapons for the ex-inspecting one of the UN Scott. Many Russian firms and important individuals also were included in the list of the al-Mada. To even the Russian Orthodox Church was supposedly implicada in the illegal commerce of oil. George Galloway subsequently earned two actions of defamation against the Christian Science Monitor and the Daily Telegraph that reportaram the accusations. Of Brazil, there were two names in the list. The first one of them was the name of a such of Fuad Sirhan, and another name was supposedly of some organization called Movement 8 of October (Chávez). Nobody of Portugal appears in the list. 

They appear in the list the names of the chief executive (I DINE), Patrick Maugein, of the company I Punch International, that supposedly is enough connected to the French president &lt;a href="w%3AJacques%20Chirac"&gt;Jacques Chirac&lt;/a&gt;; of the French ex-ambassador for the UN, Jean-Bernard; and the name president of the Indonesia Megawati Sukarnoputri. 

In an interview for the Financial Teams, the sheikh al-Kaffaji, that appears in the list, admitted that received and sold contratos of Iraqi oil for the Italtech, a company of Italian oil-producing commerce, that by his time resold the oil for the company Bayoil, that stayed in Houston, in the U.S.A. Khafaji said that the ex-inspecting one of the UN Scott Ritter swims to know about those activities. 

Arthur Millholland, the president of the Oilexco Ltd, whose name also appeared in the list of Al-Mada denied any envolvement in illicit activities, but admitted the accusations of that illegal surcharges were payment to the Iraqi government by contractors. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/TPStory/LAC/20040423/ROIL23/TPBusiness/TopStories"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 

Of any form, the list of al-Mada does not mention exactly the payment of bribes to the government of the Iraq. She quotes paid bribes to individuals for that these supported the Iraqi regimen. Few they deny that in the Iraq, as in many countries of third world, bribes regularly are paid the leaderships for acquire contracts. But some they suggest that you have bribes normally would not occur in you have countries when a program in execution of the UN was involved.

<h2>Funcionanento do esquema de corrupção</h2>

Algumas companhias superfaturavam em até 10% as contas, e parte do dinheiro era desviada para as contas bancárias privadas de Saddam Hussein ou outros funcionários do regime. Parte do dinheiro ficava com as próprias companhias.

Segundo se alega, o esquema de corrupção funcionava assim:
<ol>
BULLET::::1. os contratos de petróleo pelo programa Petróleo-por-comida eram oferecidos somente a indivíduos e organizações simpáticas ao regime iraquiano, ou somente para aqueles que poderiam ser facilmente subornados.
BULLET::::2. os contratos então eram vendidos no mercado mundial e o vendedor podia ficar com uma taxa da transação da venda do petróleo, algo em torno de 0,15 a 0,50 de dólares por barril (0,94 a 3,14 dólares por metro cúbico), segundo se calcula.
BULLET::::3. em seguida, o vendedor reembolsava o governo iraquiano com uma porcentagem de comissão.

</ol>
Estimativas mostram que Saddam Hussein usou o programa da ONU para juntar 21 bilhões de dólares a fim de subornar políticos estrangeiros para apoiar decisões contrárias aos EUA e financiar organizações terroristas. Pelo menos 74 milhões de dólares do programa Petróleo-por-comida foram direto para o &lt;a href="w%3AHamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt;. Há suspeitas de que parte do dinheiro tenha ido para a organização &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Qaeda"&gt;Al Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.forward.com/issues/2003/03.06.20/news2.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Em Fevereiro, depois que o nome de Benon Sevan, o diretor executivo do programa de Petróleo-por-comida, apareceu nos documentos do Ministério de Petróleo do Iraque, tornou-se evidente o possível envolvimento das Nações Unidas no caso. 

Supõe-se que Sevan tenha recebido em propinas pelo menos 11 000 000 de barris (1 700 000 m ³) de petróleo. Em dinheiro isto corresponde a cerca de 3.5 bilhões de dólares. Benon Sevan negou as acusações.

<h2>As investigações</h2>

Em 2000, Dileep Nair, vice-secretário-geral e diretor do gabinete que investiga os casos de ilegalidades na ONU, desejou determinar a vulnerabilidade do programa. Benon Sevan, chefe do programa Petróleo-por-comida, e a subsecretária-geral Louise Frechette rejeitaram toda e qualquer investigação sob a alegação de que ela seria muito cara e que não valeria a pena.

Enquanto Benon Sevan esteve na chefia do Petróleo-por-comida, ele rejeitou os esforços para rever e investigar o programa.
Ele rencomendou o seu pessoal que as reclamações sobre pagamentos ilegais deviam ser formalmente arquivadas com o país do reclamente, e que devia ser permitido ao Iraque barrar qualquer denúncia.

<h3>Investigation of Charles Duelfer for the Central Intelligence Agency</h3>
 On September 30, 2004, the report of special counselor Charles Duelfer of the Central Intelligence Agency (&lt;a href="w%3ACIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt;), was released. The report described the impact of the Oil-for-Food Program on the regime of Saddam Hussein:

Second the report of Charles Duelfer, Saddam received an estimated of $1.7 billion, outside of the control of the UN, between 1997 and 2003. Duelfer also said it's possible that Benon Sevan has received bribes of the plan with the oil.

<h3>GAO Investigation</h3>
After the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the victory of the Coalition over the Iraqi army, The General Accounting Office (GAO) &amp;mdash; General Office of American Accounting &amp;mdash; had the task of finalize all the contratos related upon programming By By, after the fall of the Iraqi regimen. Was responsibility of him also track the fortunes of all of the ex members of the government of the Iraq &lt;a href="http%3A//www.gao.gov/new.items/d04651t.pdf"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. During this task, the General Office found you fail in the program that permitted the existence of bribes and other forms of help for Saddam Hussein. He calculates that the regimen of Saddam Hussein generated $10.1 billion in illegal prescriptions. This number I included $5.7 billion of contrabando of oil and $4.4 billion in illicit surcharges about sales of oil and shipments powders-sell about fornecedores. 

More latter to scale of the fraud revealed be been much more extensive than the General Office of American Accounting intially had calculated. A study of Department of the Defense of the U.S.A., cited by the General Office, evaluated 759 contratos administered by the Oil-for-Food program and concluded that barely half had been fabricated, by a margin of 21 percent &lt;a href="http%3A//www.gao.gov/highlights/d04579thigh.pdf"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. 

It can be well-read in the summary of the report of the General Office of American Accounting: :♡❤Tanto the secretary of the UN, através of the office of the as much as Iraqi program the Advice of Security, através of his committee of sanctions to the Iraq, were responsible by supervise programs him By By. However, the Iraqi government negotiated straightly contratos with buyers of Iraqi oil and fornecedores of commodities, what may have been an important factor that permitted to the Iraq charge illegal surcharges and commissions.♡❤ 

Before of staffs of the United Nations will have promised full cooperation with the inquiry from the of the General Office of American Accounting, Joseph A. The Christoff, director of international business and commerce of the GAO, said that auditores of the UN had refused it liberate the internal audits of him programs By By &lt;a href="http%3A//washingtontimes.com/world/20040429-120918-1334r.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. 

Benon Sevan, leader of programs By By, with support of Kofi Annan, wrote letters for all of the ex contractors of programs By By asking that consulted Sevan before of liberate any documents for of the General Office of American Accounting, or panels of inquiry of the Congress of the United States of the America &lt;a href="http%3A//edition.cnn.com/2004/US/05/03/un.oil.for.food.letter/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. 

By all his history, the program received complaints of that he was necessary be clearer and claims of companies about revelations of private information. 

The UN denied all petitions deeds by the General Office of American Accounting for obtain access to confidential internal audits of him programs By By. 

While tried to decide to complexity of the Oil-for-Food program, in an article for the periodic one The New York Teams, to journalist investigativa Claudia Rosett, of the Foundation in Defense of the Democracy (&lt;a href="http%3A//www.defenddemocracy.org"&gt;Foundation will go the Defense of Democracies&lt;/a&gt;) and of the Institute Hudson, uncovered that details of I hire of the UN, as the identities of the contractors of programs By By, the price, the quantity and quality That were received were confidential information. The banking extracts, the payments performed and the transactions also were maintained in secret &lt;a href="http%3A//reform.house.gov/UploadedFiles/Rosett%2520Testimony--%2520%28cleaned%2520up%2520version%29.pdf"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. 

"That money [of the Oil-for-Food program] was in secret, devious for you count banking illicit, outside of the Iraq and bingo: Saddam had access to the money of outside of the country, despite of the sanctions" &lt;a href="http%3A//www.foxnews.com/story/0%2C2933%2C133087%2C00.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; , said Rosset in interview for the Foundation in Defense of the Democracy and for a collaborator of the Fox News. 

Rosett harshly was criticked by Dennis Halliday, that of 1997 to 1998 coordinated the humane help of the UN for the Iraq &lt;a href="http%3A//cnnstudentnews.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0403/19/i_dl.01.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and Benon Sevan &lt;a href="http%3A//www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0305/04/i_dl.01.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Both they affirmed that many of the statements of Rossett were incorrect, as to that says that programs By By financed the approval of an Olympic stadium, or to that affirms that the responsibility by several questions of the program differ from resolutions of the UN. 

The House Committee on International Relations investigated the Oil-for-Food program and uncovered that between 15 million and 25 million dollars in cash of the program was used by Sabah Yassen, ex-ambassador to Iraq for &lt;a href="w%3AJordan"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt;, in order to pay the Palestinian families of suicidal terrorists. From September of 2000 up to the invasion of the Iraq, the families of Palestinians dead or injured in the conflict with Israel (including the 117 responsible for suicidal attacks against Israel) received more of $35 millions.

<h3>As investigações do conselho de governo iraquiano</h3>

O conselho de governo iraquiano selecionou a empresa internacional de auditoria KPMG e a firma especializada em direito de empresas internacionais Freshfield Bruckhaus Deringer para investigar as alegações do jornal al-Mada. Ambas deveriam ter divulgado suas conclusões em Maio de 2004. Todavia, em Junho de 2004, a KPMG parou de trabalhar no projeto por falta de pagamento do conselho do governo iraquiano &lt;a href="http%3A//www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/003120.php"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Os Estados Unidos da América criticaram duramente a investigação da KPMG liderada por sócios de Ahmed Chalabi, e acusaram-no de sabotar a investigação principal iniciada por Paul Bremer. Aquela investigação foi liderada pelo chefe do Conselho Supremo de Auditores Independentes do Iraque, Ehsan Karim, com a ajuda da Ernst &amp; Young. Em Junho de 2004, a investigação de Karim concordou em compartilhar informações com a comissão montada por Volcker. Entretanto, em 1 de Julho de 2004, Karim foi assassinado por uma bomba magnética colocada em seu carro &lt;a href="http%3A//news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3855803.stm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Claude Hankes-Drielsma, um britânico amigo de longa-data de Ahmed Chalabi foi escolhido pelo conselho do governo iraquiano para coordenar as investigações do programa Petróleo-por-comida. Drielsma testemunhou perante o Congresso dos EUA em 21 de Abril de 2004 e disse que a investigação conduzida pela KPMG esperava provar a clara ligação entre aqueles países que estavam prontos a fornecer apoio ao regime de Saddam Hussein em troca de benefícios financeiros, às custas do povo iraquiano, e aqueles que se opuseram às aplicações das sanções contra o Iraque e deposição de Saddam. Ele também testemunho que Chalabi estava no comando das investigações para o conselho do governo iraquiano.

No final de Maio de 2004, no mesmo dia em que os escritórios de Chalabi no Congresso Nacional Iraquiano eram revistados pelas forças de coalião, Drielsma alegou que um indivíduou, ou indivíduos, entraram em seu computador e apagaram todos os arquivos relacionados com a sua investigação. Ele também disse que um arquivo de backup havia sido apagado.&lt;a href="http%3A//www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml%3Fxml%3D/news/2004/06/06/wirq06.xml%26amp%3BsSheet%3D/news/2004/06/06/ixworld.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Quando a jornalista Claudia Rosette perguntou-lhe se ele tinha sofrido ameaças físicas também, Drielsma retrucou com sem comentários. Drielsma também foi um crítico ferrenho da recusa por parte da ONU em tornar pública as informações internas da auditoria do programa Petróleo-por-comida para o conselho de governo iraquiano.

<h3>Investigação das Nações Unidas</h3>

No dia 19 de Março de 2004, o secretário-geral de Nações Unidas, Kofi Annan voltou atrás e disse que realizaria uma investigação completa sobre o Programa Petróleo-por-comida. Numa entrevista, o secretário-geral disse: "É altamente provável que tenha havido bastante irregularidades, mas necessitamos investigar [...] e ver quem foi o responsável". &lt;a href="http%3A//webcast.un.org/ramgen/pressconference/so040319.rm%3Fstart%3D%252200%3A00%3A03%2522"&gt;áudio&lt;/a&gt; 

Annan porém acrescentou que a maioria das denúncias eram "ultrajantes e exageradas &lt;a href="http%3A//edition.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/04/28/iraq.un.oil.reut/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Segundo ele a maior parte das críticas eram sobre questões não relacionadas ao programa.

Apenas seis auditores internos da ONU foram inicialmente designados para fiscalizar o programa Petróleo-por-comida. As recomendações da ONU dizem que pelo menos 12 auditores devem trabalhar na fiscalização de programas que gastam mais de 1 bilhão de dólares, como por exemplo, o Petróleo-por-comida. Mesmo assim, os auditores internos encontraram várias irregularidades, entre elas: a compra de 287 computadores por 870 mil dólares para os escritórios em &lt;a href="w%3ABagd%C3%A1"&gt;Bagdá&lt;/a&gt;, sendo que 100 computadores estavam a mais e não teriam uso nos escritórios; gasto considerado exorbitante de 47 mil dólares com móveis para o escritório em Bagdá, pagamento anual de 500 mil dólares para o governo iraquiano para pagar por inspetores de construções, que nunca trabalharam para a ONU; compra de seis geradores de energia elétrica a diesel, mesmo sendo difícil obter diesel na região o que seria a um custo de 10 milhões de dólares; foram gastos uma quantia considerada exagerada de 500 mil dólares com suprimentos de inverno, como roupas, para a população do Iraque.&lt;a href="http%3A//www.theage.com.au/news/Iraq/Oilforfood-audits-tell-of-millions-lost/2005/01/11/1105423481900.html%3Foneclick%3Dtrue"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 

Parte da auditoria interna da ONU vazou e apareceu no ♡❤website♡❤ mineweb.com. O relatório que vazou mostrava grandes discrepâncias entre os relatórios da empresa suíça Cotecna e os relatórios das agências da ONU, quanto a valores de transportes para a região norte do Iraque.

Para a auditoria a Cotecna não fez nenhuma inspeção "de valor" sobre quase 1 bilhão de dólares de remessas de ajuda para o Programa Humanitário da Interagência no norte iraquiano. O responsável pelo programa, Benon Sevan, foi informado das descobertas da auditoria em Dezembro de 2002 &lt;a href="http%3A//washingtontimes.com/world/20040520-121412-9548r.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

A auditoria está disponível &lt;a href="http%3A//www.foxnews.com/projects/pdf/un_oilforfood_audit.pdf"&gt;aqui&lt;/a&gt;. Seu resumo diz: 

Depois de ler o relatório de auditoria, o congressista americano Henry Hyde escreveu para Kofi Annan e perguntou por que "o Congresso de Estados Unidos, responsável por 22 por cento do orçamento do ONU e que solicitou publicamente as cópias de 55 auditorias internas, precisou depender de vazamentos de meios de comunicação para ter acesso aos documentos."

Um painel independente de inquérito das Nações Unidas foi criado em abril de 2004. Foram designados para dirigir esse painel de investigação: o ex-presidente do Fed (Banco Central dos EUA) Paul Volcker; Richard Goldstone da África do Sul e ex-promotor do Tribunal Internacional Criminal da ex-Iugoslávia e do Tribunal Internacional de &lt;a href="w%3ARuanda"&gt;Ruanda&lt;/a&gt;; e Mark Pieth, da Suíca, especialista em finanças da ♡❤Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development♡❤ (OECD).

Em 22 de abril de 2004, o Conselho de Segurança de Organização das Nações Unidas passou uma resolução unânime que endossou o inquérito de Volcker sobre corrupção no programa Petróleo-por-comida para o Iraque e pediu a colaboração dos 191 estados membros. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.nytimes.com/2004/04/22/international/middleeast/22CND-NATI.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

<h2>Last reports so far</h2>
On a initial report of 219 pages, the commission of Volcker registers that Benon Sevan used his position to make and receive request of Iraqi oil during the years that he supervised the program.

Internal documents of SOMO (Iraq 's State Oil Marketing Organization) as well as interviews with Iraqi ex-employees involved in illicit selling of oil, show that Sevan had requested and had received allocations of 7.3 millions barrels of oil in the name of a company registered in Panama called African Middle East Petroleum Co.
Although the report does not make a specific allegation of criminal activity by Sevan, Volcher does not exclude the possibility that the accusations have been filed by authorities in countries with relevant jurisdiction.
O relatório chamou a conduta de Sevan "eticamente imprópria anotando que Sevan tinha recebido grandes pagamentos à vista que totalizam 160 mil dólares por cada ano durante o qual ele tinha sido chefe do programa. O Sevan diz que o dinheiro veio de uma tia no Chipre morreu, mas a comissão de investigação não achou nenhuma evidência para apoiar esta afirmação.

Volcker também informou em Janeiro que uma revisão de 58 auditorias confidenciais da ONU sobre o programa mostrou que funcionários da ONU igonoraram precocemente sinais de que as mercadorias despachadas pela companhia suíca Cotecna para o Iraque antes da invasão de 2003 foram pouco inspecionadas, se é que foram inspecionadas. A Cotecna pagou a Kojo Annan, o filho do secretário-geral da ONU, Kofi Annan, taxas de consultoria, até Novembro de 2003. Volcker disse que os futuros relatórios deveriam tratar as questões relacionadas Kojo Annan &lt;a href="http%3A//www.iic-offp.org/documents/InterimReportFeb2005.pdf"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

O secretário-geral da Organização das Nações Unidas (ONU) general Kofi Annan foi absolvido pelo relatório da comissão de Volcker, dia 29 de Março das acusações de que ele teria usado sua influência para conceder contratos no Iraque à companhia suíça Cotecna Inspection Services , onde trabalhava seu filho Kojo Annan.

Kofi Annan porém é questionado por não ter investigado melhor as operações relacionadas a seu filho Kojo. E dois membros de seu pessoal, Iqbal Riza e Dileep Nair, foram criticados no relatório da comissão Volcker. Riza alegadamente rasgou documentos relacionados aos contratos na investigação depois que o secretário-geral rencomendou que eles fossem guardados. O jornal The New York Times disse que Nair foi "fraudulento" ao indicar uma pessoa que quase não tinha experiência para um posto de grande responsabilidade do programa Petróleo-por-comida.

O filho do secretário-geral, Kojo, também foi bastante criticado pelo relatório, que diz que ele "enganou intencionalmente o secretário-geral" sobre a sua ligação financeira com a empresa suíça. E acrescenta: "Questões significativas permanecem a respeito de Kojo e de suas ações durante o outono [boreal] de 1998, assim como da integridade de seus negócios e transações financeiras com respeito ao programa Petróleo por comida."

Kofi Annan recebeu pressões para renunciar, todavia ele disse que não fará isso.&lt;a href="http%3A//author.voanews.com/english/2005-03-29-voa66.cfm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Dia 14 de Abril, o texano David Chalmers, proprietário da empresa Bayoil Inc, de &lt;a href="w%3AHounston"&gt;Hounston&lt;/a&gt; e que participou do programa da ONU, foi preso e indiciado, acusado de ter pago milhões de dólares para o regime de Saddam Hussein e de usar dinheiro do programa Petróleo-por-comida. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.cnn.com/2005/LAW/04/14/oilfood.indictment/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Também foram indiciados um búlgaro residente dos EUA, chamado Ludmil Dionisiev, um britânico chamado John Irving e um sul-coreano identificado como Tongsun Park.

Os promotores dos EUA que investigam o caso acusaram Tongsun Park de tentar influenciar autoridades da ONU. Eles dizem que Park encontrou-se com duas autoridades de elevado posto da ONU nos anos 90 e que recebeu dois milhões de dólares por seu trabalho.

Funcionários da ONU admitiram que o ex-secretário-geral Boutros Boutros-Ghali tinha uma grande amizade com Tongsun Park e que eles se encontraram por diversas vezes durante os anos noventa, que era a época em que se acertavam os detalhes do programa Petróleo-por-comida.

Um alto funcionário da ONU, Maurice Strong, admitiu que manteve relações com o sul-coreano Tongsun Park. Strong confirmou que Tongsun Park investiu numa empresa de energia da qual Strong fazia parte, em 1997. Todavia, Strong disse que o investimento foi uma relação comercial normal e que não tinha nenhuma relação com o Iraque. 

Maurice Strong é um conselheiro próximo do secretário-geral da ONU Kofi Annan. Em entrevista para a agência de notícias VOA, Koffi Anan disse que desconhecia qualquer relacionamento financeiro entre Strong e Park.&lt;a href="http%3A//author.voanews.com/english/2005-04-19-voa70.cfm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AGoogle%20News"&gt;Google News&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ submitted &lt;a href="w%3APatent"&gt;patent&lt;/a&gt; applications both in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and world-wide in September 2003 for a system of ranking search returns. The patent protection filings seek to control ♡❤Google's♡❤ approach that filters headlines through a complicated &lt;a href="w%3Aalgorithm"&gt;algorithm&lt;/a&gt;, including the quality of the news organization. How much of this system is currently in use by the search engine giant is unknown.

Primitive search engines are expected to organically evaluate links based on how closely the keywords typed in the search field match an object link, and how many other links are attached to the object. Then a measure of relevance is calculated before returning a reply.

It seems some measure of the work being done at ♡❤Google♡❤ is a reaction to &lt;a href="w%3ASearch%20engine%20optimization"&gt;search engine optimization&lt;/a&gt; (SEO) campaigns which can, if done effectively, skew results to certain domains. A challenge for ♡❤Google♡❤ is to develop its technology to nullify efforts on the dark side of SEO and &lt;a href="w%3ALink%20spam"&gt;link-spamming&lt;/a&gt;. 

What also seems to be coming out from this, according to research from the ♡❤Internet Search Engine Database♡❤, is that ♡❤Google♡❤ does indeed have a 'sandbox' where domains are evaluated first by a human factor before being released into its algorithms.

In its first ever &lt;a href="w%3ASecurities%20and%20Exchange%20Commission"&gt;Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt; filing since the company went public last year, Google indicated that it intends to spend US$500 million on technology development, more than double the $177 million it spent two years ago.

The language used in the lengthy patent application itself is difficult to understand. An excellent article titled "Google United - Google Patent Examined" found below, describes some of the nuts and bolts of Google's techniques.

The two unique &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ainteger%20factorization"&gt;prime factors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of a 200-digit number have been discovered by researchers in Germany and the Netherlands. The number, named &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARSA-200"&gt;RSA-200&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , is one of a series of challenges issued by security company &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARSA%20Security"&gt;RSA Security&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in March 1991 in order to track the real-world difficulty of factoring such numbers, used in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Apublic-key%20encryption"&gt;public-key encryption&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; algorithm &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARSA"&gt;RSA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The factorisation of RSA-200 beats the previous record number "c176" (176 digits, factored on May 2nd, 2005), and RSA-576 (174 digits, factored on December 3rd, 2003). 

Written out, RSA-200 is:

The two factors are:

and

The researchers had been working on factoring the number since Christmas 2003. The result was a collaboration between researchers at Bonn University and the German Federal Agency for Information Technology Security (BIS) in Germany, and the CWI (Netherlands). Friedrich Bahr, M. Böhm, Jens Franke, and Thorsten Kleinjung report that they used the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ageneral%20number%20field%20sieve"&gt;general number field sieve&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (GNFS) to factor the number. The factoring was performed using a number of machines in parallel. The initial "sieving" step took the equivalent of 55 CPU-years on a single machine (2.2Ghz Opteron CPU). Some work was also performed by Peter Montgomery, Herman te Riele and F. Bahr. Bahr, Franke, Kleinjung, te Riele and Bahr were also part of the team who factored a previous record number, RSA-576.

RSA-200 was part of the original RSA Factoring Challenge, which was discontinued and replaced with a different set of numbers in 2001. One number in the new challenge, named &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARSA-640"&gt;RSA-640&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , has only 193 digits (compared to the 200 of RSA-200), and carries a prize of US$20,000 for its factorisation.

Two serious security flaws have been found in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMozilla%20Firefox"&gt;Mozilla Firefox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aweb%20browser"&gt;browser&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , both rated by security analysts as being 'extremely critical'. 

An attack using a combination of the two flaws has already been posted on the Internet, which can allow an attacker to run code on a victim's computer and take control of it.

One allows for an invisible website 'frame' to navigate back to a URL in the History that contains &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJavaScript"&gt;JavaScript&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . This allows an attacker to extract sensitive information, such as passwords from that site, using the JavaScript code.

The second allows attackers to put JavaScript into the URL for the icon for downloading programs in the install confirmation dialogue box. This JavaScript code can then execute with enhanced privileges.

The flaws have been confirmed in the latest version of the browser, 1.0.3, and may well be present in older versions too.

A number of changes have been made to update.mozilla.org and addons.mozilla.org to make the example attack useless. This doesn't mean that other sites can't be used to launch the attack, so be careful what you add to the "Allowed Sites" list. The reason that update.mozilla.org and addons.mozilla.org were targeted specifically is that they are added to the "Allowed Sites" list during the install process.

The most popular browser on the web is &lt;a href="Microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20Explorer"&gt;Internet Explorer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which has had many security exploits in the past. There are currently several outstanding security flaws, the most severe of which is rated 'Highly Critical'.

<h2>Protecting yourself</h2>
On May 11, 2005, the Mozilla Foundation released Firefox 1.0.4 and Mozilla 1.7.8 with the vulnerabilities patched.

The Mozilla Foundation has published a series of steps for users using previous versions of the browser. The steps will limit their vulnerability, but which also limits browser functionality:

<ol>
BULLET::::1. Select the "Options" dialog from the "Tools" menu
BULLET::::2. Select the "Web Features" icon
BULLET::::3. Click the "Allowed Sites" button on the same line as the "Allow web sites to install software" checkbox
BULLET::::4. Click the "Remove All Sites" button
BULLET::::5. Click "OK"

</ol>
To prevent the script injection exploit from stealing cookies or other sensitive data disable Javascript before visiting untrustworthy sites. In Firefox:

<ol>
BULLET::::1. Select the "Options" dialog from the "Tools" menu
BULLET::::2. Select the "Web Features" icon
BULLET::::3. Uncheck the "Enable Javascript" checkbox
BULLET::::4. Click "OK"

A new $35m &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHolocaust"&gt;Holocaust&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; memorial in &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; officially called the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe was dedicated during a ceremony Tuesday. The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMemorial%20to%20the%20Murdered%20Jews%20of%20Europe"&gt;memorial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; commemorates the suffering the millions of European &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJudaism"&gt;Jews&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; who were held in &lt;a href="w%3Aconcentration%20camp"&gt;concentration camp&lt;/a&gt;s by the Nazi regime. The dedication comes just a day after the 60th anniversary of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVictory%20in%20Europe"&gt;Allied Victory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20War%20II"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

U.S. architect &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Eisenman"&gt;Peter Eisenman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; designed the new memorial, which is contained in one block square very close to the parliament and the new US embassy in the heart of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABerlin"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Germany. The memorial consists of over 2,700 gray concrete blocks representing the helplessness of the Holocaust victims. The blocks are covered with an anti-graffiti substance which was made by the same company that produced the Zyklon B poison used in the genocide. They are all of different shapes and sizes, and are set on a sloping hillside, designed to produce an uneasy, confusing atmosphere.

The memorial has met with criticism. Many have pointed out that the memorial is only for the Jews who died, and does not represent the millions of gypsies, homosexuals and mentally-handicapped people who were also murdered. It has also been said that while the memorial commerates those who died, it does not ask any questions about why the atrocity happened. However, there are plans for memorials commemorating other victims of the Nazi regime. Under the abstract memorial there is a place which informs visitors about Holocaust.

The ceremony, which Chancellor &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGerhard%20Schr%C3%B6der"&gt;Gerhard Schröder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; attended, included prayer led by a Jewish &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="wikt%3Arabbi"&gt;rabbi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and speeches reflecting on the Holocaust given by a survivor and leaders of the Jewish community in Germany.

The New Zealand Government has been forced to act because of a letter sent to Prime Minister &lt;a href="Helen%20Clark"&gt;Helen Clark&lt;/a&gt; which claimed that the disease &lt;a href="w%3Afoot%20and%20mouth%20disease"&gt;Foot and Mouth&lt;/a&gt; is being intentionally spread on &lt;a href="w%3AWaiheke%20Island"&gt;Waiheke Island&lt;/a&gt;.

The letter, which is assumed to be a hoax, could have a major impact on New Zealand's meat industry. Agriculture Minister Jim Sutton went so far as to say that the suspension of meat exports by some countries was a real possibility.

The incubation period of foot and mouth disease is such that if animals have been infected, signs should be evident within ten days. In the meantime, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry experts and veterinarians, many with experience gained in the recent United Kingdom outbreak, are conducting intensive monitoring of the Island's susceptible animals. All sheep and cattle are being individually inspected every 48 hours. Meanwhile, restrictions on the movement of livestock are in place, so that in the very unlikely event that there has been a release of the disease, the effects will be contained.

Police efforts are underway to track the origin of the letter that initiated the scare.

<h2>Update 16 May, 2005</h2>

The foot-and-mouth scare is effectively over after a second letter confirmed it was a hoax.
But Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry officials would continue low level monitoring on the island until next Monday.

<h1>Accuser admits he lied, former Canadian immigration minister cleared of wrongdoing</h1>
♡❤♡, ♡❤♡ 

The &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; parliament's Ethics Commission said former immigration minister, &lt;a href="w%3AJudy%20Sgro"&gt;Judy Sgro&lt;/a&gt;, did nothing wrong and her staff had put her into a conflict of interest. Harjit Singh, the pizza shop owner who signed an affidavit accusing her of offering help for him to stay in Canada in exchange for pizza deliveries and help on her election campaign, admitted he lied. The controversies forced Ms. Sgro to resign from her post in January.

Ms. Sgro read a letter from Mr. Singh in the House of Commons Tuesday. "Reputations should not be tarnished by unsubstantiated allegations and innuendo solely for partisan politics,” she added.

After a 17-year fight to stay in Canada, Mr. Singh was deported to India in February. In his letter he said: "I now admit that I did not have a meeting with Judy Sgro. Further, at no time, did Judy Sgro request any campaign assistance from me nor did she help me with my immigration problems. I am providing this apology and retraction voluntarily and of my own free will."

In a press conference, Ms. Sgro also discussed the confidential letter she'd received from ethics commissioner Bernard Shapiro. In his letter informing her of the commission's decision Mr. Shapiro wrote "It appears that you have acted appropriately but that your staff did not.” The report on the incident from the commission is not actually finished, according to the commissioner, but he said Ms. Sgro was free to release the letter.

<h1>Canadian Liberal government loses House of Commons vote, won't call election</h1>
♡❤♡, ♡❤♡ 
The &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt; government lost a key vote on a censure motion in the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20House%20of%20Commons"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt;, but has ignored demands by the &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Conservatives&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ABloc%20Qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois"&gt;Bloc Québécois&lt;/a&gt; to resign and call an election.

Liberal House leader &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Valeri"&gt;Tony Valeri&lt;/a&gt; told &lt;a href="w%3AParliament%20of%20Canada"&gt;Parliament&lt;/a&gt; after the vote, "We will continue to govern on behalf of Canadians," through a chorus of dispute.

Opposition parties claim they have triggered a constitutional crisis by clearly indicating the government no longer has the right to rule, but they have refused to ask Parliament to be dissolved. The opposition have been working for weeks to bring about a technical maneuver such as this when the government is weakened by months of wrangling over the Sponsorship Scandal.

The vote involved amending a report from October 2004 recommending the government resign for failure to address "governance of the public service."

The &lt;a href="w%3AConstitution%20of%20Canada"&gt;Canadian constitution&lt;/a&gt; calls for a government to dissolve and hold elections when there is a Parliamentary vote of no confidence, or a vote defeating a budget or money bill. The government says the censure amendment vote does not constitute an official vote of no confidence. Constitutional experts have said that the vote does raise a question-mark over confidence, and that this will therefore have to be settled expeditiously with a true confidence motion.

The event is likely to paralyze Parliament. The Conservatives have promised to shut down the Parliament, by voting each morning to end the day before any work is done.

<h2>Background</h2>

The current status of the Parliament has the Liberals with 132 seats. The Conservatives hold 99 seats and are working in concert with the Bloc Québécois who hold 54 seats. Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Martin"&gt;Paul Martin&lt;/a&gt; recently worked a deal with the New Democrat Party, whose 19 seats have strengthened his position but still lack a majority. The remaining three independent seats and one vacancy quite literally may determine the outcome of a no-confidence vote if held later this month.

The government is only 10 months old, having been elected &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20federal%20election%2C%202004"&gt;June 28, 2004&lt;/a&gt;, and is a rare minority government in Canadian history.

A ♡❤Sunday Times♡❤ reporter went undercover through a Transnistrian secret police office. Posing as a middleman for an &lt;a href="Algiers"&gt;Algerian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Islam"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;ic group, the reporter met with an arms dealer, who offered to sell three of the rockets for US$500,000 (£263,000).

The Alazan is an 82mm diameter rocket originally developed to distribute cloud-seeding chemicals such as potassium or silver iodide. With a range of eight miles, the rockets could be used to contaminate an entire city center. These rockets were part of fifty thousand tons of equipment that Soviet forces left in the republic after the Cold War.

Some were converted into improvised munitions and modified to carry explosive warheads. Others were retrofitted with a warhead reputed to contain up to 400g of radioactive caesium-137 and strontium-90, to help scientists track clouds and other meteorological events. 

The arms dealer offered to allow the reporter to inspect the rockets with a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeiger%20counter"&gt;Geiger counter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to confirm that they contained caesium and strontium.

For the &lt;a href="w%3AChesapeake%20Bay"&gt;Chesapeake Bay&lt;/a&gt;, the largest &lt;a href="w%3A%20Estuary"&gt;estuary&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, a first-time-ever “water quality forecast” was issued Monday for the upcoming summer season by the Chesapeake Bay Program. The eastern &lt;a href="w%3AMid-Atlantic%20States"&gt;mid-Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; region’s heavy spring rainfalls are predicted to increase nutrient levels in bay waters, leading to oxygen eating &lt;a href="w%3A%20Algal%20bloom"&gt;algae blooms&lt;/a&gt; and leaving deep water &lt;a href="w%3A%20Dead%20zone"&gt;dead zones&lt;/a&gt;.
Project leader William Dennison, of the &lt;a href="w%3A%20University%20of%20Maryland%20Center%20for%20Environmental%20Studies"&gt;University of Maryland Center for Environmental Studies&lt;/a&gt; said, “The forecast indicates that recent weather conditions and heavy pollutant loads could lead to a bad summer for the Bay.” The prediction is for this to be the fourth-worst season for dissolved oxygen in two decades.

The Chesapeake Bay Program launched the new forecast to build on a base of environmental data gathered over the last two decades as water quality concerns have grown. The forecast is meant to be a proactive tool that provides resource managers with information that can be used to guide policies for the bay’s protection and restoration.

Cars, fertilizer, human and animal wastes, industrial and agricultural pollutants all play a part. "This means that we need to do a lot more to reduce phosphorus and nitrogen pollution from getting into the bay," said Beth McGee, of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation. "The biggest source of pollution in the bay is agriculture, and we've got to find a way to provide farmers with more resources to manage the land better."
Nutrient rich pollutants composed mainly of nitrogen and phosphorous come from far away places carried by rivers, and nearby the bay from farm and metropolitan runoff. They collect in the huge bay and meet tidal flows from the ocean.

Algae feed off the nutrients, and they are either consumed by aquatic life or sink at the end of their life cycle. With such an abundant food source, algae blooms can cover large surfaces of water and choke off sunlight to underwater plants. Later when the plants die, the process of their decomposition on the bottom consumes oxygen to a state where the water becomes &lt;a href="w%3A%20Anoxic%20event"&gt;anoxic&lt;/a&gt;, and unable to support life.

As notorious as weather forecasters are for often being wrong, it should come as no surprise if this first forecasting step by the federally funded program misses its mark. Forces such as heavy storms or hurricanes, which churn water, would have an effect. Excessive wind and unexpected precipitation, or nutrient level jumps, would also contribute.

Two California legislative committees voted on Tuesday to reject a state constitution amendment banning gay marriage.

Republican Assemblyman Ray Haynes claimed that a proposal before the Assembly Judiciary Committee would strengthen the intent of a ballot measure that prevents the recognition of gay marriages performed out of State. The amendment was rejected.

The Senate Judiciary Committee rejected an identical measure just hours later.

However, Conservative groups say that they plan to put an initiative on the ballot in 2006 banning gay marriage in the constitution.

<h1>Romanian opposition gets more TV time than governing coalition</h1>

A recent survey carried out by the National Broadcasting Council of &lt;a href="w%3ARomania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; has shown that the largest Romanian opposition party, the &lt;a href="w%3ASocial%20Democratic%20Party%20%28Romania%29"&gt;Social Democrats&lt;/a&gt;, made a greater number of TV appearances than members of the governing &lt;a href="w%3AJustice%20and%20Truth"&gt;Justice and Truth Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. However, the politician with the most TV appearances remained the Prime Minister, &lt;a href="w%3ACalin%20Popescu-Tariceanu"&gt;Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu&lt;/a&gt;.

The opposition &lt;a href="w%3ASocial%20Democratic%20Party%20%28Romania%29"&gt;Social Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; (PSD) made 350 TV appearances in the past month, followed by the governing &lt;a href="w%3AJustice%20and%20Truth"&gt;Justice and Truth Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, with 270 appearances, the &lt;a href="w%3AGreat%20Romania%20People%27s%20Party"&gt;Great Romania People's Party&lt;/a&gt;, with 59 appearances, the &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20%28Romania%29"&gt;Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt; with 36 appearances and the &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Alliance%20of%20Hungarians%20in%20Romania"&gt;Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania&lt;/a&gt;, with 24 appearances.

PSD representatives had the greatest amount of TV appearances on &lt;a href="w%3ATeleviziunea%20Romana"&gt;TVR&lt;/a&gt;, the state-owned broadcaster, &lt;a href="w%3AAntena%201"&gt;Antena 1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AProTV"&gt;ProTV&lt;/a&gt; and Realitatea TV. Prima TV was the only TV network which broadcast more appearances by the Justice and Truth Alliance than the PSD.

The most covered politician was the Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ACalin%20Popescu-Tariceanu"&gt;Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu&lt;/a&gt;, with 73 appearances, trailed by the leader of the Social Democratic Party, &lt;a href="w%3AMircea%20Geoana"&gt;Mircea Geoană&lt;/a&gt; (53 appearances) and the former Prime Minister, &lt;a href="w%3AAdrian%20Nastase"&gt;Adrian Năstase&lt;/a&gt; (37 appearances). In fourth place was the former President, and current Social Democrat senator, &lt;a href="w%3AIon%20Iliescu"&gt;Ion Iliescu&lt;/a&gt;, followed by Vasile Ion, the father of Marie-Jeanne Ion, one of the three Romanian journalists kidnapped in Iraq in March. Other featured politicians include Dumitru Dragomir, from the Great Romania People's Party, Nicolae Văcăroiu, from the Social Democrats, and Eugen Nicolaescu, spokesman of the Justice and Truth Alliance.

On the state-owned TVR network, representatives of the opposition had 42% more news coverage than the governing coalition. 33% of this coverage was positive, 9% was negative and the remainder was indifferent. The private station ProTV featured the greatest coverage of the Social Democrats, with 67%, 30% of which was positive.

One important political figure which was left out of the study is Romania's President, &lt;a href="w%3ATraian%20Basescu"&gt;Traian Băsescu&lt;/a&gt;. The National Broadcasting Council did not monitor Băsescu's appearances because he is not a member of any political party.

A group of businessmen and politicians from the Italian region of &lt;a href="w%3ATrento"&gt;Trento&lt;/a&gt; have expressed their interest in investing up to &lt;a href="w%3Aeuro"&gt;€&lt;/a&gt;700 million in &lt;a href="w%3ACluj"&gt;Cluj county&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARomania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;, for tourism development. Marius Nicoară, the president of Cluj County Council, stated that the council would be interested in collaborating with the Italian investors for the development of mountain roads and ski resorts in the area.

Cluj county, which is located in the centre of &lt;a href="w%3ATransylvania"&gt;Transylvania&lt;/a&gt;, is one of the most mountainous areas of the country. The county receives tourists, mainly for winter sports like skiing, and also has &lt;a href="w%3Aagritourism"&gt;agritourism&lt;/a&gt;. The county's capital, &lt;a href="w%3ACluj-Napoca"&gt;Cluj-Napoca&lt;/a&gt;, is one of the largest cities in Romania.

Corrado Fedrizzi, the president of the Trento Development Agency, said that the Italian delegation needs an estimate of the number of tourists which could be attracted to the area if the development takes place, the amortisation time for the investment and the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; (EU) funds which could be awarded to support the project. Romania plans to become a member of the European Union in 2007, but currently receives a significant amount of pre-accession funds from the EU.

Brazil's capital city of &lt;a href="Brasilia"&gt;Brasilia&lt;/a&gt; is hosting the Summit of South American and Arab Countries from May 10 to 11, according to the Brazilian Ministry of External Relations. Brazilian President &lt;a href="Luiz%20In%C3%A1cio%20Lula%20da%20Silva"&gt;Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva&lt;/a&gt; proposed the summit during his visit to several Arab countries in December, 2004.

According to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARadiobras"&gt;Radiobras&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , President da Silva said in his speech during the opening ceremony of the summit, that it is necessary to define a new economic and commercial international geography. "We are searching for trade that is fair and balanced, rid of the subsidies imposed by the rich countries, and which assures the poor countries the benefits of globalization. We want to establish a new relationship of solidary collaboration with international financial agencies, and we are striving for the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMercosur"&gt;Mercosur&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the Gulf Cooperation Council to be able to conclude an economic cooperation agreement", da Silva said. &lt;a href="http%3A//internacional.radiobras.gov.br/ingles/materia_i_2004.php%3Fmateria%3D224947%26amp%3Bq%3D1%26amp%3Bidioma%3DIG"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;a href="Mahmoud%20Abbas"&gt;Mahmoud Abbas&lt;/a&gt; said that &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;i troops should unconditionally withdraw from the occupied Arab territories. Abbas also proposed the creation of an Arab-South American bank.

The President of &lt;a href="Algeria"&gt;Algeria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Abdelaziz%20Bouteflika"&gt;Abdelaziz Bouteflika&lt;/a&gt;, said during his speech that Israel should leave the Palestinian territories. Bouteflika defended the criterion of a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.estadao.com.br/nacional/noticias/2005/mai/10/48.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Bouteflika said that the Palestinian situation is "a denial of justice" that can no longer be tolerated. A long round of applause from Summit participants followed his declarations. "We must find a definitive solution for everyone to do his best, to get Israel to submit to international law and accept the negotiated peace," Bouteflika added. &lt;a href="http%3A//internacional.radiobras.gov.br/ingles/materia_i_2004.php%3Fmateria%3D224976%26amp%3Bq%3D1%26amp%3Bidioma%3DIG"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The President of &lt;a href="Venezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Hugo%20Ch%C3%A1vez"&gt;Hugo Chávez&lt;/a&gt; said that the Arab and South American countries are related because they both were subjected to exploitation by the richest countries. Chávez said that after World War II, South America has been victim of domination mechanisms by an international financial architecture and by an old international organizations structure. According to Chávez, there is no international democracy. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.estadao.com.br/nacional/noticias/2005/mai/10/102.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Chávez said that South American and Arab countries are the biggest oil sources and that this fact stimulates the "American imperialist voracity". &lt;a href="http%3A//www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/brasil/ult96u68891.shtml"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

According to the Minister of Foreign Relations, Celso Amorim, the final document of the Summit of South American-Arab Countries will condemn terrorism. In addition, the document will include a paragraph about the "right of resistance to foreign occupation, according to international humanitarian law," said the minister.

The minister said that the document will also mention the sovereignty of the &lt;a href="Falkland%20Islands"&gt;Falkland Islands&lt;/a&gt;, under dispute by &lt;a href="Argentina"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http%3A//internacional.radiobras.gov.br/ingles/materia_i_2004.php%3Fmateria%3D224937%26amp%3Bq%3D1%26amp%3Bidioma%3DIG"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;a href="North%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;'s official news agency is reporting that the country has finished removing all its spent nuclear fuel rods, over 8,000 of them, from the main reactor in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AYongbyon%20Reactors"&gt;Yongbyon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; nuclear plant.

The rods could be reprocessed for several months to extract weapons-grade &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aplutonium"&gt;plutonium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Officials say the rods could be able to provide enough plutonium to make two nuclear bombs. 

This could possibly signal that North Korea is preparing for a nuclear arms test. North Korea may already have enough materials to make six nuclear bombs.

North Korea has also announced plans to continue operating the Yongbyon facility, as well as to begin construction on a larger reactor.

Two men were taken into custody for violating the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ano-fly%20zone"&gt;no-fly zone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; surrounding the &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; national capital in &lt;a href="Washington%20D.C."&gt;Washington D.C.&lt;/a&gt;

The &lt;a href="United%20States%20Capitol"&gt;Capitol Building&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASupreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Treasury"&gt;Department of the Treasury&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20White%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; were evacuated around noon Wednesday. People in the vicinity were told to head to a rail station approximately a half mile south of the White House. Reporters in the White House itself were told to move into the basement.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was not in the White House at the time. CNN and Bloomberg have reported that the President was on a bicycle ride; CTV has reported that he was at Patuxent Wildlife Research Center in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABeltsville%2C%20Maryland"&gt;Beltsville&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMaryland"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Wire sources report the cause of the evacuation as being a small plane that wandered into the no-fly zone. The craft was reportedly a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACessna%20150"&gt;Cessna 150&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which flew into restricted space, left the area, and then returned. It was then escorted out of the zone by two &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AF-16%20Fighting%20Falcon"&gt;F-16s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that fired warning flares at it. 

♡❤MSNBC♡❤ reported that a 'lure motorcade' drove away from the White House.

Authorities gave the "all-clear" signal a few minutes after the evacuation. Other government agencies outside of the immediate area were largely unaffected.

At the time of the police-ordered evacuation, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Senate"&gt;Senator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADick%20Shelby"&gt;Richard Shelby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAlabama"&gt;AL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , was on the Senate floor. "They said get out of here, so I ran. There's no joking about this kind of stuff," Shelby said.

The two men who were flying the aircraft were on their way to an air show when they slipped into Washington D.C.'s Restricted Airspace (image at right). Their plane was escorted to a Maryland airport where they were taken into custody and interviewed by authorities. Once it became clear the incident had been a mistake, the two men were released.

In Washington, D.C., a 25 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Akilometre"&gt;km&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; radius from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20Monument"&gt;Washington Monument&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is restricted air space.

The &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Labour%20Organization"&gt;International Labour Organization&lt;/a&gt; (ILO) released a major &lt;a href="http%3A//www.ilo.org/dyn/declaris/DECLARATIONWEB.DOWNLOAD_BLOB%3FVar_DocumentID%3D2841"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday, finding that currently more than 12.3 million people are enslaved worldwide. An estimated 2.4 million of them are victims of slave trafficking, and their combined labor generates profits of over 32 billion dollars annually. 

Forced labor is "a social evil which has no place in the modern world," said ILO Director-General Juan Somavia. "Forced labor represents the underside of globalization and denies people their basic rights and dignity... to achieve a fair globalization and decent work for all, it is imperative to eradicate forced labour," added Somavia. 

The new study confirms that slavery remains a major global problem to this day. The report breaks down slaves by continent: 
<ul>
BULLET::::- 9.5 million forced laborers are in Asia, which is the region with the highest number
BULLET::::- 1.3 million in Latin America and the Caribbean
BULLET::::- 660,000 in sub-Saharan Africa
BULLET::::- 260,000 in the Middle East and North Africa
BULLET::::- 360,000 in industrialized countries
BULLET::::- 210,000 in transition countries.

</ul>
The study also reveals that slavery is present in all regions and in all types of economies.

Forced economic exploitation is more or less evenly divided between men and women, however forced commercial sexual exploitation involves almost entirely women and girls. In addition, children bear a heavy burden, comprising between 40 to 50 percent of all slaves. 

There are at least two victims of forced labor for every 1,000 people ♡❤worldwide♡❤.

By a majority of 378 to 262, &lt;a href="w%3AMember%20of%20the%20European%20Parliament"&gt;Members of the European Parliament&lt;/a&gt; have voted to abolish the right of &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; countries to opt out of &lt;a href="w%3AWorking%20Time%20Directive"&gt;Working Time Directive&lt;/a&gt;. If the &lt;a href="w%3ACouncil%20of%20the%20European%20Union"&gt;Council of Ministers&lt;/a&gt; agrees, the right to opt out of the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union%20directive"&gt;directive&lt;/a&gt; will be phased out over a period of three years.

Under the "derogation" provision of the directive, individual workers can waive the right to work no more than 48 hours per week. Among the member states, only the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; uses this provision.

Amid publicity that arose from deaths and injuries due to dog attacks in the region, the &lt;a href="w%3ASpotsylvania%20County"&gt;Spotsylvania County&lt;/a&gt; Board of Supervisors voted unanimously to impose tougher penalties on dog owners who let their dogs run free. After a public hearing Tuesday evening, the board voted for a new animal control ordinance. Now dog owners who are repeat offenders face a misdemeanor crime of $2,500 or up to a year in jail.

Dogs that repeatedly chase cars and run free, or otherwise trespass on property, could be euthanized if so ordered by a judge. A dog that is "roaming, running or self-hunting off the property or premises of its owner or custodian and not under the immediate control of the owner or custodian or his agent," meets the county's legal definition of a dog running at large. 

The mauling death of an elderly woman by 3 &lt;a href="w%3APit%20Bulls"&gt;Pit Bulls&lt;/a&gt; in her front yard sparked a public debate on animal control. At the hearing, State Senator Edward Houke said he would raise dog law issues in the January meeting of the &lt;a href="w%3AVirginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; General Assembly. According to ♡❤The Free Lance Star♡❤, Houke said, "It's pretty obvious to me that the state law needs to be changed, but saying that and it happening, is two completely different phenomena. If there's one thing you learn quickly it's that you don't bring dog bills to the Virginia General Assembly."

The Sullivan daughters, who lost their mother in the mauling attack, circulated petitions in the county and also attended the hearing. Board chairman Robert Hagan noted the Sullivan family presence and thanked them for their efforts to prevent more tragedies.

&lt;a href="w%3AFK%20Red%20Star"&gt;Red Star&lt;/a&gt; (Crvena Zvezda) &lt;a href="w%3ABelgrade"&gt;Belgrade&lt;/a&gt; advanced to the &lt;a href="w%3ASerbia%20and%20Montenegro"&gt;Serbia and Montenegro&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Afootball"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; cup finals, after defeating &lt;a href="w%3AFK%20Partizan"&gt;Partizan&lt;/a&gt; Belgrade with a score of 2:0 yesterday. 
The first goal was scored by Nikola Žigić in the tenth minute (10'). Krivokapić scored the other goal in the final moments of the match - 90'.

The game between city rivals was attended by only about 8,000 fans. Aside from heavy rain, many fans of both Red Star and Partizan decided to boycott the game. 

Red Star's fans were forbidden from performing their traditional choreography at the beginning of the match, probably due to riots that took place the last time Red Star and Partizan played a regular league game. Partizan's fans displayed a large sign reading "Football Association of Serbia and Montenegro = mafia."

Red Star has a chance to win the cup against &lt;a href="w%3AFC%20Zeleznik"&gt;Železnik&lt;/a&gt;, while Partizan is on its way to win the league with a 7 point lead.

Christian Delgado Gomez, a &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Antonio%2C%20Texas"&gt;San Antonio&lt;/a&gt; pilot, was sentenced to six months and forced to pay a $500 fine for smuggling four undocumented Chinese immigrants. 

The incident occurred on January 24, 2005, when Delgado was arrested at Stinson Municipal Airport in San Antonio where he landed a small aircraft he used to transport the illegal immigrants from Eagle Pass, Texas. The officers who arrested him were acting on a tip that two planes, one from Laredo and another from Eagle Pass, would be carrying illicit cargo. This coincided with a false tip that the cargo would be in coordination with a terrorist act in Boston. 

The Chinese immigrants were deported.

In a speech to business leaders in &lt;a href="w%3AToronto"&gt;Toronto, Canada&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday, Former &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Homeland%20Security"&gt;Homeland Security&lt;/a&gt; Secretary &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Ridge"&gt;Tom Ridge&lt;/a&gt; contradicted a view that the &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; border security system is weak. Rather, he praised the role of Canada in protecting the U.S./Canadian border.

"I don't accept the thesis that Canada is lenient or hasn't done what it needs to do to advance their interest and doing their share to combat terrorism... The law enforcement and intelligence community collaboration is excellent."

The U.S. border with Canada is 4,000 miles long, twice as long as its border with &lt;a href="w%3AMexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;.

Since &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%2C%202001%20attacks"&gt;September 11, 2001&lt;/a&gt;, $8 billion has been spent by Canada on border security improvements. Canada plans to spend an additional $1 billion in the coming year.

Senator &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Voinovich"&gt;George Voinovich&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3AOhio"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt;) provided a critical vote today to send &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20R.%20Bolton"&gt;John R. Bolton&lt;/a&gt; to the Senate for a vote on his nomination. Bolton is &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt;'s nominee for United States ambassador to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;.

The highly controversial and contested nominee has come under scrutiny from members of both parties for his political stance concerning the United Nations. Senator Voinovich previously voted "no", stopping the nomination from leaving the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Now that Voinovich is voting "yes", the nomination can be put before the full Senate for a vote. 

However, the Senator issued scathing remarks concerning Bolton, referring to him as a "bully" and claiming that he is a disgrace to the nation. Also, Voinovich stated that he would vote "no" in the Senate to Bolton's confirmation.

A &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; Senate committee, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI), released evidence in a probe that purportedly suggests that two &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;U.K.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; politicians received vouchers for millions of barrels of &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraqi&lt;/a&gt; oil in exchange for their support of &lt;a href="w%3ASaddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein's&lt;/a&gt; regime under the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;U.N.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AOil-for-Food%20Programme"&gt;Oil-for-Food Program&lt;/a&gt; (OFP).

Under the OFP program, Iraq was allowed to sell its oil rights to whomever it wanted, and at a below-market price. These oil rights could then be re-sold for a higher price, usually between 3 and 30 cents a barrel. U.K. MP &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Galloway"&gt;George Galloway&lt;/a&gt; and French Senate member &lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Pasqua"&gt;Charles Pasqua&lt;/a&gt; are accused of having these rights allocated to them as a reward for opposing the U.S lead economic sanctions on Iraq. However, no evidence was presented showing that those politicians had received any money benefit out of the scheme.

The PSI committee found Hussien-era documents that appear to show the two politicians received these oil rights. They also heard from officials from the old regime who confirmed the documents.

George Galloway, who won re-election to the &lt;a href="w%3AParliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom"&gt;British Parliament&lt;/a&gt; in a surprise victory, is accused of receiving allocations for 20 million barrels of oil. He is also accused of using the Mariam Appeal, a campaign he set up "♡❤to campaign against sanctions on Iraq which are having disastrous effects on the ordinary people of Iraq♡❤" which was best known for flying an Iraqi child to England for Leukemia treatment, to conceal the transfer of 3 million barrels of oil.

Galloway, a member of the new British left-wing anti-war Party, &lt;a href="w%3ARESPECT%20The%20Unity%20Coalition"&gt;Respect&lt;/a&gt;, won a ferocious campaign for parliament last week in &lt;a href="w%3ABethnal%20Green%20and%20Bow%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29"&gt;Bethnal Green and Bow&lt;/a&gt;, east London, where a sizable part of the population is of a Muslim southern Asian origin.

George Galloway won libel suits in the past against the &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ATelegraph"&gt;Telegraph&lt;/a&gt; newpaper which claimed he had accepted bribes from the Iraqi regime. The Senate committee will be holding a further hearing on May 17, and have invited Galloway to attend, where he will be given a seat and a microphone.

Charles Pasqua, currently member of the Senate of France, was in the past &lt;a href="w%3AMinister%20of%20the%20Interior%20%28France%29"&gt;Minister of the Interior&lt;/a&gt;, in charge of law enforcement, safety measures and relationships with local governments. His name has been cited in several corruption scandals inside France, though he has not been convicted. He currently heads a small &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AEurosceptic"&gt;Eurosceptic&lt;/a&gt; party with no representative in the National Assembly, and is generally considered to be somewhat close to Jacques Chirac's &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AUnion%20for%20a%20Popular%20Movement"&gt;UMP&lt;/a&gt; party, though he has distanced himself from that party from 1998 onwards.

Israel's Independence Day was marked by protests around &lt;a href="w%3AGaza%20Strip"&gt;Gaza&lt;/a&gt; as nationalist Israelis rallied against the planned dismantling of 21 settlements in the region. The settlements house 8,500 Jews, surrounded by 1.3 million Palestinians. 

The protests where peaceful as many marched or even held picnics in the settlements. Police estimated a turnout of about 35,000 but organizers estimated 80,000. 

This comes after similar, larger protests against &lt;a href="w%3AAriel%20Sharon"&gt;Ariel Sharon's&lt;/a&gt; plan to end conflict with the Palestinians over the area.

Part of a stone retaining wall supporting the &lt;a href="w%3AHenry%20Hudson%20Parkway"&gt;Henry Hudson Parkway&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; near 181st Street collapsed Thursday at 20:00 UTC. The parkway was closed in both directions.

The wall supported the outdoor backyard of the &lt;a href="w%3ACastle%20Village"&gt;Castle Village&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Ahousing%20cooperative"&gt;co-op&lt;/a&gt;, and was nearly 100 years old.

According to New York City Mayor &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20R.%20Bloomberg"&gt;Michael R. Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;, no-one was injured, and there was no vehicular or pedestrian traffic at the time of the collapse. Several parked cars were buried under rubble and debris, which spilled out across &lt;a href="w%3ARiverside%20Drive%20%28New%20York%29"&gt;Riverside Drive&lt;/a&gt; where it merges with the northbound lanes of the parkway and onto the parkway itself. 

The mayor said that cleanup of the wall will begin next week.

&lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; parliament's lower house, the &lt;a href="w%3ABundestag"&gt;Bundestag&lt;/a&gt;, passed the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AConstitution"&gt;Constitution&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, with 569 yes votes, 23 against and 2 abstentions. 
Two-thirds majority was required to pass it.

The Constitution still needs to be passed through the &lt;a href="w%3ABundesrat"&gt;Bundesrat&lt;/a&gt;, the upper house, before it is officially ratified by Germany.

The overwhelming support did not come as a surprise, since Germany, one of the founders of the pact, is one of the biggest EU supporters amongst all members. The &lt;a href="w%3AGerman%20Chancellor"&gt;German Chancellor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGerhard%20Schroeder"&gt;Gerhard Schroeder&lt;/a&gt;, was quoted by Der Spiegel as saying: "Whoever wants more democracy in Europe must vote for the constitution." The Bundesrat is expected to pass the Constitution with similar ease on May 27. 

All 25 Union members must ratify the European Constitution before it takes effect.

Today &lt;a href="Pope%20Benedict%20XVI"&gt;Pope Benedict XVI&lt;/a&gt; announced, in a meeting with the Roman clergy at the Basilica of St. John Lateran, that the process for &lt;a href="w%3Abeatification"&gt;beatification&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Pope%20John%20Paul%20II"&gt;Pope John Paul II&lt;/a&gt; can be started soon. The process of beatification is the first step in the Catholic Church towards the proclamation of santification (&lt;a href="w%3Acanonization"&gt;canonization&lt;/a&gt;) of a person.

Usually there is a five year waiting period after the death of a candidate for beatification before the procedures may begin. Pope Benedict XVI waived this period on May 9. The only other case where the waiting period has been waived was &lt;a href="w%3AMother%20Teresa"&gt;Mother Teresa&lt;/a&gt;, whose beatification was begun in 1998, a year after her death, and completed in 2003.

John Paul II can not be &lt;a href="w%3Astyle%20%28manner%20of%20address%29"&gt;style&lt;/a&gt;d a saint until he has been both formally beatified and canonized, processes that have no timetables and may take several years.

Since the process of beatification should be started in the diocese where the person died, the process should be started by the Cardinal Vicar, Camillo Ruini, who should instruct the process under the competent Court.

<h1>Uzbekistan protesters under fire after prison break</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Uzbekistan%20protesters%20under%20fire%20after%20prison%20break&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Protesters in the city of &lt;a href="w%3AAndijan"&gt;Andijan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUzbekistan"&gt;Uzbekistan&lt;/a&gt; have been fired on by government troops after taking over the Mayor's office and releasing some 2,000 prisoners overnight. ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AVOA"&gt;Voice of America&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ news is reporting nine dead, and 34 injured, while ten police officers are being held as hostages.

Uzbekistan president &lt;a href="w%3AIslam%20Karimov"&gt;Islam Karimov&lt;/a&gt; arrived in Andijan this morning to oversee operations, and is expected to make an announcement on national television. Security forces are being deployed, and sporadic automatic gunfire was reported in the city.

President Islam Karimov claimed Saturday that authorities tried to negotiate a peaceful end to protests, but that troops were forced to open fire when insurgents seized the government building and attempted to break through an advancing line of Uzbek police and soldiers. 

Thousands are said to have taken to the streets of the city to protest the unfair trial of &lt;a href="w%3AMuslim"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; activists and draw attention to human rights abuses. A trial of 23 local businessmen on charges of religious extremism triggered the protests. &lt;a href="w%3AAmnesty%20International"&gt;Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt; reports that the government uses the law to crack down on activists.

The &lt;a href="w%3AFerghana%20Valley"&gt;Ferghana Valley&lt;/a&gt; region of the Andijon province is viewed as restive under the rule of Islam Karimov. &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; officials have stated concern that the protests and unrest may spread in the country. Neighbouring states &lt;a href="w%3ATajikistan"&gt;Tajikistan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AKyrgyzstan"&gt;Kyrgyzstan&lt;/a&gt; have closed their borders with Uzbekistan.

<h1>Irish inflation back on the rise</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Irish%20inflation%20back%20on%20the%20rise&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

According to new figures from the &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Statistics%20Office%20of%20Ireland"&gt;Central Statistics Office (CSO)&lt;/a&gt;, the annual rate of inflation in &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; has begun to rise again after a period of decline. Annualised inflation is now running at 2.2%, up from 2.1% in March.

The figures are derived from the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AConsumer%20Price%20Index"&gt;Consumer Price Index&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ which is monitored by the CSO. Despite the increase, inflation remains significantly below the figure for recent years. Annualised inflation peaked at 5.1% in February 2003.

The major contributor to the rise was the cost of heating and housing with the ♡❤Housing, Water, Electricity, Gas and Other Fuels♡❤ group rising 10.6% in the past 12 months - with 2% of that rise in the last month alone. When broken down more the section marked ♡❤Energy Products♡❤ showed a massive 5.3% rise in the past month alone.

This sharp rise in energy costs was offset somewhat by decreases (over the past 12 months) in the following groups: 
<ul>
BULLET::::- Food and Non-Alcoholic Beverages (-0.5%)
BULLET::::- Clothing and Footwear (-2.8%)
BULLET::::- Furnishings, Household Equipment and Routine Household Maintenance (-1.4%)
BULLET::::- Communications (-0.2%)
BULLET::::- Miscellaneous Goods &amp; Services (-1.3%).

</ul>
According to the CSO the Consumer Price Index is made up of ♡❤over 55,000 prices♡❤ ♡❤consisting of 613 headings which cover over 1,000 different items♡❤.

Seven people were killed and over 76 injured in the first three days of anti-&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; protests in &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;. The protests are a response to a published report that states U.S. guards in &lt;a href="Guantanamo%20Bay"&gt;Guantanamo Bay&lt;/a&gt; defiled the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKoran"&gt;Koran&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . 

Four policemen and soldiers were killed in the attack in the province of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGhazni"&gt;Ghazni&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , southwest of the nation's capital, &lt;a href="Kabul"&gt;Kabul&lt;/a&gt;. Police chief in Badakhshan, Shah Jahan Noori, reported three dead civilians, and the &lt;a href="BBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; reported nine more deaths in the fourth day of protests. 

US Secretary of State &lt;a href="Condoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; said on Thursday that "respect for religious freedom for all individuals is one of the founding principles of the United States" and that if allegations are proven, the U.S. government will take "appropriate actions".

Demonstrations have been reported in at least 12 Afghan cities, but have also spread to neighbouring &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANewsweek"&gt;Newsweek&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ reported on May 9 that US guards in Guantanamo Bay placed Korans above toilets, to scare the prisoners, and even flushed one down a commode in a demonstration.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="wikt%3AImam"&gt;Imams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in Kabul expressed their support for demonstrators, but vowed for non-violence.

&lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Senator"&gt;U.S. Senator&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AWayne%20Allard"&gt;Wayne Allard&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Republican%20Party"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3AColorado"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt;), in a letter to Army Secretary &lt;a href="w%3AFrancis%20Harvey"&gt;Francis Harvey&lt;/a&gt;, said that the &lt;a href="w%3Asecretary%20of%20the%20Army"&gt;secretary of the Army&lt;/a&gt; should launch a nationwide investigation into reports that some Army recruiters engaged in questionable recruiting tactics. In the letter Allard wrote that "according to these reports, the rules weren't just bent, they were broken and tossed away."

One of the reports the Senator is referring to is the attempted recruitment of David McSwane, a 17 year old editor of a &lt;a href="w%3Ahigh%20school"&gt;high school&lt;/a&gt; newspaper in &lt;a href="w%3AGolden%2C%20Colorado"&gt;Golden, Colorado&lt;/a&gt;. McSwane posed as a high school dropout, with a drug problem that he was "unable to kick". Then he recorded, on audio tape, conversations allegedly showing that the recruiters told him how to obtain a phony diploma on the Internet and what medication to buy to cover up the drug problem. A friend of McSwane's also video-taped a recruiter taking McSwain to a store to buy a "detox" medication to help him pass the army physical. David said he was told by the recruiter to buy the product. 

A voice on the audio tape is heard saying, "You just have to follow instructions to a tee. It has got like a 150 percent guarantee that you will pass. You know, I've seen it work before."

"If I were a soldier out on the front line, I wouldn't want someone next to me who my life could be depending on going through withdrawal or having a drug addiction or just being someone I can't trust. I just don't think that's something we need on our front lines," David McSwane said on &lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;. 

His mother, concerned that people may think he was being unpatriotic by setting up the "sting" operation said: "He's probably one of the most &lt;a href="w%3Apatriotism"&gt;patriotic&lt;/a&gt; kids I know. He was in the &lt;a href="w%3AYoung%20Marines"&gt;Young Marines&lt;/a&gt; for almost a year and earned a couple (of) awards."

&lt;a href="w%3AMajor%20General"&gt;Major General&lt;/a&gt; Michael Rochelle, the general in charge of recruiting for the U.S. Army responded to the allegations and tapes. "I was disappointed by it," Rochelle said. "I was very disappointed by it." He is shutting down recruiting offices for 1 day to review their procedures.

Jim Massey, a former Marine recruiter, expanded the accusations by saying the same fraudulent recruitment practices existed in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Marines%20Corps"&gt;United States Marines Corps&lt;/a&gt;. 

"This isn't just an isolated incident," Massey said. "This is a widespread epidemic. I would say 98 percent [of the recruits Massey enlisted] were frauded into the military."

The Army has suspended two recruiters in Golden, Colorado.

Documents leaked from the U.K. government revealed an apparent secret agreement between the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; to attack &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; in 2002. &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Times"&gt;The Times&lt;/a&gt;, a British national newspaper, reported that newly-discovered documents reveal British and U.S. intentions to invade Iraq and leaders of the two countries had "discussed creating pretextual justifications for doing so". The documents go on to say that &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; decided the U.S. would need to "create" conditions to justify the war. The leaked document has not received much coverage in the United States.

The document, known popularly as the "&lt;a href="w%3ADowning%20Street%20memo"&gt;Downing Street memo&lt;/a&gt;", is a document purporting to contain the minutes taken during a meeting among United Kingdom government and political figures on July 23, 2002 discussing the build-up to the &lt;a href="w%3A2003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq"&gt;2003 invasion of Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. Its authenticity has not been officially confirmed nor denied by the government, though Downing Street has stated that the document contains "&lt;a href="http%3A//www.timesonline.co.uk/printFriendly/0%2C%2C1-523-1592904-523%2C00.html"&gt;nothing new&lt;/a&gt;." There have been repeated media and &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Conyers"&gt;congressional&lt;/a&gt; requests for clarification.

&lt;a href="w%3ADowning%20Street"&gt;Downing Street&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; contains the official residence of the &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom"&gt;Prime Minister of the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;] (at &lt;a href="w%3A10%20Downing%20Street"&gt;10 Downing Street&lt;/a&gt;) and is a &lt;a href="w%3Ametonymy"&gt;metonym&lt;/a&gt; for the United Kingdom government. Ultimately the United Kingdom sent 46,000 troops to join the United States-led action, by far the largest non-US contingent in the invasion.

The memo comes on the heels of other leaked documents from the UK. &lt;a href="http%3A//news.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml%3Fxml%3D/news/2004/09/18/nwar118.xml"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The memo says that it was sent to &lt;a href="w%3ASecretary%20of%20State%20for%20Defence"&gt;Secretary of State for Defence&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGeoff%20Hoon"&gt;Geoff Hoon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASecretary%20of%20State%20for%20Foreign%20and%20Commonwealth%20Affairs"&gt;Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJack%20Straw"&gt;Jack Straw&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAttorney%20General%20of%20England%20and%20Wales"&gt;Attorney General of England and Wales&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Goldsmith%2C%20Baron%20Goldsmith"&gt;Lord Goldsmith&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACabinet%20Secretary"&gt;Cabinet Secretary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Thomas%20James%20Wilson"&gt;Sir Richard Wilson&lt;/a&gt;, Chairman of the &lt;a href="w%3AUK%20Joint%20Intelligence%20Committee"&gt;Joint Intelligence Committee&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Scarlett"&gt;John Scarlett&lt;/a&gt;, Director of the &lt;a href="w%3AGovernment%20Communications%20Headquarters"&gt;Government Communications Headquarters&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFrancis%20Richards"&gt;Francis Richards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AChief%20of%20the%20Defence%20Staff%20%28United%20Kingdom%29"&gt;Chief of the Defence Staff&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Boyce%2C%20Baron%20Boyce"&gt;Sir Michael Boyce&lt;/a&gt;, Head of the &lt;a href="w%3ASecret%20Intelligence%20Service"&gt;Secret Intelligence Service&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Dearlove"&gt;Richard Dearlove&lt;/a&gt;, Prime Minister's Chief of Staff &lt;a href="w%3AJonathan%20Powell%20%28civil%20servant%29"&gt;Jonathan Powell&lt;/a&gt;, Downing Street Director of Government Relations &lt;a href="w%3ASally%20Morgan%20%28politician%29"&gt;Sally Morgan&lt;/a&gt;, and Downing Street Director of Communications and Strategy &lt;a href="w%3AAlastair%20Campbell"&gt;Alastair Campbell&lt;/a&gt;.

The memo was intended to be kept confidential and is headed ♡❤This record is extremely sensitive. No further copies should be made. It should be shown only to those with a genuine need to know its contents.♡❤ It deals with the lead-up to the 2003 Iraq War, and comes at a point at which it becomes clear to those attending, that &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;U.S. President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; intended to remove &lt;a href="w%3ASaddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt; from power by force.

The memo runs through the military options and then considers the political strategy in which an appeal for support from the international community and from domestic opinion would be most likely to be positively received. It suggests that an &lt;a href="w%3Aultimatum"&gt;ultimatum&lt;/a&gt; for Saddam to allow back &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; weapons inspectors be issued, and that this would help to make the use of force legal. Tony Blair is quoted as saying that the British public would support &lt;a href="w%3Aregime%20change"&gt;regime change&lt;/a&gt; in the right political context.

The most controversial paragraph is a report of a recent visit to Washington by Dearlove (known in official terminology as 'C'):

This was even more explicitly stated elsewhere in the memo:

The main sections covering the ultimatum are:

<h2>Veracity</h2>
A former senior U.S. official called it "an absolutely accurate description of what transpired" during the senior British intelligence officer's visit to Washington. He spoke on condition of anonymity. UK Prime Minister Tony Blair denied that anything in the memo demonstrated misconduct and said that it added little to what was already known about how British policy on Iraq developed.

The US and British administrations have neither confirmed nor denied its accuracy: 

<ul>
BULLET::::- White House spokesman Scott McClellan, when questioned about the document's accuracy, did not confirm or deny its accuracy.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, when questioned about the document's accuracy, did not confirm or deny its accuracy.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- George W. Bush has not responded to questions from Congress regarding the memo's accuracy.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- The British Embassy in Washington did not respond to requests for comment.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- A White House official said the administration wouldn't comment on leaked British documents.

</ul>
<h2>Interpretations</h2>
Critics of the war claim that the memo proves that the &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush Administration&lt;/a&gt;
<ol>
BULLET::::1. was determined to go to war with Iraq prior to considerations of legality,
BULLET::::2. and with full knowledge that, at best, "the case was slim",
BULLET::::3. &lt;a href="w%3Aconfirmation%20bias"&gt;selected and exaggerated intelligence so as to confirm&lt;/a&gt; their policy and
BULLET::::4. developed a plan to manipulate public opinion.
BULLET::::5. Also, critics say that the contents (such as "Military action was now seen as inevitable.") and the ♡❤date♡❤ of the memo, July 23rd, 2002, contradicts the official White House position that Mr. Bush did not finally decide to carry out the invasion of March 2003 until after Secretary of State Colin L. Powell presented the administration's case to the United Nations Security Council, in a speech on Feb. 5, 2003. They also point out that the memo is dated at a time when Bush stated that "we haven't made any decisions on Iraq, but all options are on the table."
BULLET::::6. Another paragraph has been interpreted to show that Geoff Hoon believed timing of the war's start was intended to influence American elections:

</ol>

Some people suggest that it is clear from the memo that some of those present at the meeting believed that Iraq might possess &lt;a href="w%3Aweapons%20of%20mass%20destruction"&gt;weapons of mass destruction&lt;/a&gt; (WMD) "capacity". However, the memo explicitly states that the capability was less than that of Libya, Iran, and North Korea, and that Saddam was not threatening his neighbors.

<h2>Reaction</h2>
<h3>UK Prime Minister Tony Blair</h3>
When the document was published, UK Prime Minister Tony Blair denied that anything in the memo demonstrated misconduct and said that it added little to what was already known about how British policy on Iraq developed.

<h3>US Congress</h3>
On May 5, &lt;a href="w%3ACongressman"&gt;Congressman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Conyers"&gt;John Conyers&lt;/a&gt; sent a to President Bush signed by 89 of his colleagues demanding an explanation of the revelations in the memo. No specific White House response to the letter has been made publicly. In response to the Bush Administration's refusal to answer the congressional delegation's questions, Conyers et. al have given serious consideration to sending a fact-finding mission to the UK. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0%2C%2C2087-1622378%2C00.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Conyers has requested 100,000 signatures from citizens (a petition) to request that the President Bush answer the questions in his letter. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.johnconyers.campaignoffice.com/index.asp%3FType%3DSUPERFORMS%26amp%3BSEC%3D%7B0F1B03E0-080B-4100-B143-36A5985EF1E3%7D"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

<h3>White House spokesman Scott McClellan</h3>
On May 16, presidential spokesman &lt;a href="w%3AScott%20McClellan"&gt;Scott McClellan&lt;/a&gt; said that the memo's statement that intelligence was "being fixed" to support a decision to invade Iraq was "flat out wrong." However, McClellan admitted that he has not read the memo, but has only received reports of what it contains. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.cnn.com/2005/US/05/16/iraq.memo/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

On May 17, McClellan told reporters that the White House saw "no need" to respond to the letter from Congress. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.nytimes.com/2005/05/20/politics/20weapons.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

On May 23, McClellan retracted his statement about intelligence treatment: 

This has jokingly been called "the McClellan challenge". &lt;a href="http%3A//thinkprogress.org/index.php%3Fp%3D951"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

<h3>US Secretary of State Rice and UK Foreign Secretary Straw</h3>
On May 18th, 2005, US &lt;a href="w%3ASecretary%20of%20State"&gt;Secretary of State&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACondoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; and UK &lt;a href="w%3ASecretary%20of%20State%20for%20Foreign%20and%20Commonwealth%20Affairs"&gt;Foreign Secretary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJack%20Straw%20%28politician%29"&gt;Jack Straw&lt;/a&gt; were questioned on the memo, during live coverage of a joint US-UK conference, aired on &lt;a href="w%3ASky%20News"&gt;Sky News&lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;And if I could, then, ask both of you to comment on the very well-publicised British memo that was leaked ... from the minutes of a meeting that took place in July of 2002 with Tony Blair and some of his military intelligence advisers. In particular, it quotes one British official saying the intelligence and facts that the U.S. was putting forward were being fixed around the policy...

...could you speak to these allegations, in particular, Madam Secretary, and whether or not this is true?

...Mr. Secretary Straw, if you could also speak to the authenticity of this memo? And in particular, you're quoted in here saying that 'The case was thin, Saddam was not threatening his neighbours, and his WMD capacity was less than that of Libya, North Korea or Iran.'&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Neither Rice nor Straw answered the questions. The full transcript is available &lt;a href="http%3A//www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2005/46412.htm"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

<h3>News coverage</h3>
The memo was a major story in the British press during the last few days of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%202005"&gt;2005 general election campaign&lt;/a&gt; and was also covered in other countries. The story had limited coverage in the USA but has recently gained more attention in the American press.

Some have criticized the American media’s coverage of the memo as disturbingly poor.

On, May 20th, 2005, a new Public Editor for &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20New%20York%20Times"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt; (NYT), publicly assesed the coverage of the memo in The New York Times in a forum on the their website. He also stated that, due to continuing reader interest, the paper intends to give fuller coverage to the memo. &lt;a href="http%3A//forums.nytimes.com/top/opinion/readersopinions/forums/thepubliceditor/danielokrent/index.html%3Foffset%3D47%26amp%3Bfid%3D.f555e99/47"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The lack of news coverage of the memo has also spurred criticism from Media Watchdogs and editors of small newspapers. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.fair.org/index.php"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http%3A//watchingthewatchers.org/index.php%3Fp%3D496"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http%3A//www.mcall.com/news/opinion/oped/all-columnmay28%2C0%2C1875503.column"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

<h3>Internet</h3>
Numerous web logs have picked up the story (see &lt;a href="http%3A//www.blogpulse.com/trend%3Fquery1%3D%2522downing%2Bstreet%2Bmemo%2522%26amp%3Blabel1%3Ddowning%2Bstreet%2Bmemo%26amp%3Bquery2%3D%2522smoking%2Bgun%2Bmemo%2522%26amp%3Blabel2%3Dsmoking%2Bgun%2Bmemo%26amp%3Bquery3%3D%2522downing%2Bstreet%2Bmemo%2522%2BOR%2B%2522smoking%2Bgun%2Bmemo%2522%26amp%3Blabel3%3Dcombined%26amp%3Bdays%3D60%26amp%3Bx%3D42%26amp%3By%3D9"&gt;blogpulse&lt;/a&gt; for a histogram), and a website, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.downingstreetmemo.com"&gt;www.downingstreetmemo.com&lt;/a&gt;, has been created dedicated to informing the public about the memo.

<h3>Pundits</h3>
On May 18, conservative pundit and former &lt;a href="w%3ARonald%20Reagan"&gt;Reagan Administration&lt;/a&gt; advisor &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Craig%20Roberts"&gt;Paul Craig Roberts&lt;/a&gt; wrote an article calling for Bush's &lt;a href="w%3Aimpeachment%20in%20the%20United%20States"&gt;impeachment&lt;/a&gt; for lying to Congress about the case for war.

<h3>Citizens</h3>
A coalition of citizen groups running the gamut of social and political issues will ask Congress to file a ♡❤♡Resolution of Inquiry♡❤♡, the first necessary legal step to determine whether President Bush has committed impeachable offenses. &lt;a href="http%3A//rawstory.com/exclusives/alexandrovna/coalition_inquiry_downing_street_memo_526"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The formal Resolution of Inquiry request was written by &lt;a href="w%3ABoston"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt; constitutional attorney John C. Bonifaz and reported by &lt;a href="Larisa%20Alexandrovna"&gt;Larisa Alexandrovna&lt;/a&gt; for Raw Story, article available here &lt;a href="http%3A//rawstory.com/exclusives/alexandrovna/memo_bush_impeachable_offenses_526"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The request states the constitutional grounds for impeachment:

Among the citizen groups are:
<ul>
BULLET::::- Veterans for Peace
BULLET::::- Progressive Democrats of America (PDA)
BULLET::::- 911Citizens Watch
BULLET::::- Democracy Rising
BULLET::::- Code Pink
BULLET::::- Global Exchange
BULLET::::- Democrats.com
BULLET::::- Velvet Revolution, and
BULLET::::- Gold Star Families for Peace

</ul>
A website, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.afterdowningstreet.org/"&gt;afterdowningstreet.org&lt;/a&gt;, has been established for the newly emerging citizen's coalition.

A &lt;a href="http%3A//www.websidestory.com/products/web-analytics/datainsights/spotlight/05-10-2005.html"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; on May 10 by web analytics company WebSideStory estimates usage in the United States of Microsoft's &lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20Explorer"&gt;Internet Explorer&lt;/a&gt; (IE) &lt;a href="w%3Aweb%20browser"&gt;web browser&lt;/a&gt; to have fallen to 88.9% by April 29, 2005, from 89.9% on February 18, 2005. Microsoft's strongest competitor, &lt;a href="w%3AMozilla%20Firefox"&gt;Mozilla Firefox&lt;/a&gt;, improved its market share from 5.7% to 6.8%. 

All browsers based on Mozilla program code combined have a market share of 9%, while other browser alternatives combined make up a share of 2.1%. 

The report also contains data from Germany and Japan. Firefox was found to have a much higher usage share in Germany (22.6%), and a lower one in Japan (2.8%), where Internet Explorer still holds 93.9% of the market. 

While Firefox's market share is still increasing in the United States, its growth has slowed down compared to a very rapid increase after its widely reported 1.0 release on November 9, 2004. Technology writer Paul Festa speculated in an editorial for ♡❤Silicon.com♡❤ that the decreasing growth rate "could mean that the browser has converted a substantial proportion of its natural constituency, thought to be early adopters and the technically savvy." Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser developed by the non-profit &lt;a href="w%3AMozilla%20Foundation"&gt;Mozilla Foundation&lt;/a&gt; in collaboration with a team of volunteers.

In most countries, Microsoft's Internet Explorer has long enjoyed a market share above 90 percent. Many have attributed this to the browser's deep integration into the &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20Windows"&gt;Microsoft Windows&lt;/a&gt; operating system. 

Browser usage also varies strongly for different demographics. PC World, for example, reports only 67% of their visitors use IE.

While Firefox's market share continues to increase, its growth rate has slowed and it may not reach its target of 10% overall market share by the end of 2005.

Perhaps in response to inroads in a market it has dominated so heavily for many years, Microsoft chairman Bill Gates announced plans in February for a new release of the IE browser before the release of Windows Longhorn. The focus of the new release is improved security, which is much sought by users as IE is thought to be the vector of most security flaws in the Windows environment. Two new vulnerabilities have been reported within the past two months which affect Windows NT, 2000, and XP. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.eeye.com/html/research/upcoming/20050505.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http%3A//www.eeye.com/html/research/upcoming/20050316.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Microsoft's new release may be late, as some corporations are taking steps towards promoting Firefox as an alternative to Internet Explorer. ♡❤CNET News♡❤ reported on Thursday that technology giant &lt;a href="w%3AIBM"&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt; is encouraging its employees to use Firefox. IBM is also promoting other open-source technologies such as the free &lt;a href="w%3ALinux"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; operating system.

<h1>U.S. Defense Secretary announces closures and expansions of military bases</h1>
♡❤♡, ♡❤♡ 
&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Defense"&gt;United States Secretary of Defense&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADonald%20Rumsfeld"&gt;Donald Rumsfeld&lt;/a&gt; announced the closure of 33 major military facilities in 22 states around the U.S. When word of the plans to shuffle facilities was released, closing some and expanding others, many community leaders shuddered.

Cities like &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Antonio%2C%20Texas"&gt;San Antonio, Texas&lt;/a&gt;, a town built on the back of military establishments, fear the possible economic effects. If the city's bases were closed, the city and local businesses could be crippled. The current announcement, however, benefits the city of San Antonio with the expansion of &lt;a href="w%3AFort%20Sam%20Houston"&gt;Ft. Sam Houston&lt;/a&gt;, despite the closure of two air bases.

&lt;a href="w%3AGroton%2C%20Connecticut"&gt;Groton, Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand faces the closure of a submarine base. &lt;a href="w%3AJoseph%20Lieberman"&gt;Senator Joseph Lieberman&lt;/a&gt; (D-Conn) claimed the closure was "cruel and unusual punishment." His state would lose 7,133 military jobs as well as 1,041 civilian jobs. Many communities around the nation stand to lose, while others could end up winners, as a result of the announced re-shuffle.

Israel's Independence Day was marked by protests around &lt;a href="w%3AGaza%20Strip"&gt;Gaza Strip&lt;/a&gt; as nationalist Israelis rallied against the dismantling of 21 settlements in the region. The protests where peaceful as many marched or even held picnics in the settlements. Police estimated a turnout of about 35,000 but organizers estimated much higher numbers. This comes after similar, larger protests against &lt;a href="w%3AAriel%20Sharon"&gt;Ariel Sharon&lt;/a&gt;'s plan to end conflict with the Palestinians over the area.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMyrtle%20Beach%2C%20South%20Carolina"&gt;Myrtle Beach, South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — This weekend is the kick-off for two motorcycle rallies held annually in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; eastern seacoast town of &lt;a href="w%3AMyrtle%20Beach"&gt;Myrtle Beach&lt;/a&gt;. Enthusiasts this year are expected to meet or exceed the 170,000 bikers that arrived last year in droves to the small resort town of 23,000. Festivities span two weeks, and extend again this year into the &lt;a href="w%3A%20Memorial%20Day"&gt;Memorial Day&lt;/a&gt;.
Leading off is the week-long Harley rally, followed by the next week's BikeFest. In and around town, both day and night are punctured by the sounds of bike engines gunned and revved at stop lights and in parking lots. Groups of cycle riders dominate the streets.
“By Friday night, the front parking lot will be a full line of motorcycles to the corner.” said motel owner Ranjan Patel. The ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASuper%208"&gt;Super 8&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ motel takes up half a block at its location in the heart of the downtown motel strip. “Both sides [of Ocean Blvd] are nothing but bikes.” Both she and her co-owner husband agree, the influx of bikers dwarf in size the numbers of tourists who visit during regular summer months for ocean-side and family amusement park attractions.

The highly accesorised bikes, decked with chrome and polished to show it, flashed the townscape. &lt;a href="w%3A%20Chopper%20%28motorcycle%29"&gt;Choppers&lt;/a&gt; made a showing, but road &lt;a href="w%3Ahog"&gt;hogs&lt;/a&gt; dominated the ridership, often going twosome. Many rally goers arrived on the scene with &lt;a href="w%3A%20Sport%20utility%20vehicle"&gt;SUV’s&lt;/a&gt; or big &lt;a href="w%3A%20Pickup%20truck"&gt;pickup trucks&lt;/a&gt; towing cargo trailers loaded with cycles.

Growth in the sheer size of the two rallies led police to make changes in the handling of traffic flow. During BikeFest last year, the mostly black crowd that came in on the heels of the largely white Harley rally the week earlier, were faced with confusion when the two-lane Ocean Blvd was made one-way.

A branch of the &lt;a href="w%3A%20NAACP"&gt;NAACP&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3A%20Conway%2C%20South%20Carolina"&gt;Conway&lt;/a&gt;, the next town over from Myrtle Beach, alleged discrimination by &lt;a href="w%3A%20Horry%20County%2C%20South%20Carolina"&gt;Horry County&lt;/a&gt; and Myrtle Beach Police. They claimed authorities and police used an overwhelming and aggressive police presence, combined with a restrictive one-way traffic pattern, to intimidate and discourage the participants in the rally.

An injunction was issued earlier this week by U.S. District Judge Terry Wooten, who ruled that bikers at both rallies be treated the same. Myrtle Beach city lawyers immediately filed an appeal to the ruling at the Fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, saying "the trial court erroneously determined that the plaintiffs would likely succeed on the merits; that is, that the city of Myrtle Beach intentionally treats Memorial Day weekend tourists differently from others similarly situated because of their race."

A plan to submit an opposition to the notice has already been announced by Michael Navarre, an attorney for Steptoe &amp; Johnson, who represents the NAACP civil rights group. "We certainly don't think the judge has ruled erroneously," Navarre said, according to ♡❤The Sun News♡❤.

Traffic control and safety measures were in full swing Friday morning on US-17. Both directions of the 4-lane divided highway south of Myrtle Beach had traffic cones and parking barriers set up to control traffic. Large flashing road signs on each side of the highway warned cars to use the passing lane. The warning sign flashed a message that the right lane was for motorcycle use only. Police monitored the pull-offs near a Harley dealer's lot where popular attractions were set-up in the immediate vicinity.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADinamo%20Moscow"&gt;Dinamo Moscow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; came into agreement with &lt;a href="FC%20Porto"&gt;FC Porto&lt;/a&gt; on a deal bringing two stars of Portugal's national team, Maniche and Costinha into the Russian club. Their transfer cost was 16 and 4 million euros respectively, making this the most expensive transfer deal in Russian football. The head of Dinamo's board of directors, Alexey Fedorychev, is among the wealthiest Russian businessmen and he is responsible for making the money available to the club. Another Dinamo transfer target is the Greek footballer Seitaridis, also playing for Porto, but this deal has not yet been confirmed.

Meanwhile, in a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARussian%20Premier%20League"&gt;Russian Premier League&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; match Saturday with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAmkar%20Perm"&gt;Amkar Perm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Dinamo Moscow suffered its fourth defeat in a row 1-2, dropping to 9th place. Amkar (one of the poorest teams in Premier League) on the other hand, won the second match in a row. Despite conceding an early goal, Amkar was able to fight back, score from a penalty and secure a slender lead to win the away game.

Despite numerous signings between seasons and hiring a new coach, Oleg Romantsev, Dinamo's performance is far from the best. Last season saw them at 14th place (out of 16), barely avoiding relegation, and the start of a new season isn't promising either. It is yet to be seen, whether the new signings can help the club join the ranks of the top RPL teams, such as Lokomotiv Moscow and CSKA Moscow.

Arab news channel &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AAl%20Jazeera"&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/a&gt; announced Saturday that it plans to open an English-language channel called Al Jazeera International at the beginning of 2006. The project fits in with the robust growth and in-your-face style of the original channel, but faces significant challenges in the new markets.

Al Jazeera's confrontational approach to news has earned it enemies in every government in the Middle East. Its independence has caused the Iranian government to close its Tehran bureau for covering ethnic riots near the border with Iraq.

Al Jazeera has also earned the enmity of Washington D.C., where the Bush administration regularly complains about their coverage. Al Jazeera offices were also hit by U.S. weapons in Kabul, Afghanistan, and Baghdad, Iraq, although the U.S. military insists they were accidental targets.

The biggest issue for Al Jazeera is a lack of distribution. All major news services in North America, a prime market for the English language channel, struggle to gain and maintain distribution.

The new channel has named its management team:
<ul>
BULLET::::- Nigel Parsons is to head operations at the company's Doha headquarters
BULLET::::- Sue Philips, a former employee of the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ACanadian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation"&gt;Canadian Broadcasting Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, is to be in charge of the European coverage from Al Jazeera's London office

BULLET::::- And Will Stebbins, formerly with , is to head the North American operations.

</ul>
Al Jazeera has been expanding in other markets as well. It opened a channel last month which covers news events without a presenter or commentary. It also have a sports channel and plans for a children's channel.

Uzbekistan President Islam Karimov blamed Islamic militants for the violence in the eastern city of Andijan. The unrest led to government troops firing on civilan protesters and rebels, killing at least fifty according to local hospital sources. Independent sources count the number of dead over 100. 

Today, President Karimov denied directing his troops to open fire, blaiming the outlawed Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir for the deaths following their insurrection.

"I know you want to know who gave the order to fire at them ... No one ordered (troops) to fire at them," Karimov told the news conference in Tashkent today.

Eyewitnesses reported seeing crowds of unarmed protestors being fired upon by soldiers. Human rights groups have lamented Uzbekistan's poor human rights record of torture arbitrary arrest and torture. The White House has called for restraint to avoid further bloodshed. The Russian Foreign Ministry has expressed support for Kamirov in the face of what it terms extremism. 

The White House's muted response may reflect the political sensitivity of its air base in southern Uzbekistan which supports its operations in neighbouring Afghanistan. It's widely feared that, should the unrest spread, Uzbekistan may see the popular overthrow of the government as occurred in neighbouring Kyrgystan.

Meetings are scheduled for Monday and Tuesday in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKaesong"&gt;Kaesong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="North%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;, between vice-ministers of &lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South&lt;/a&gt; and North Korea. The talks are the result of telephone messages between the two countries on Saturday and are the first official talks between the countries in 10 months.

The initial element in the discussions is a humanitarian aid request for 500,000 tons of fertilizer. South Korea's government has indicated it can supply this. Annual requests for fertilizer run from 200,000 to 300,000 tons.

South Korea has also indicated they can use the meeting to discuss nuclear issues and the resumption of multi-party talks. The &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; has also met with North Korea's United Nations ambassador to discuss resumption of the six-party talks.

Relations between the two countries had been warming, but high level meetings were cut off when it became known South Korea had airlifted 460 North Korea refugees from Vietnam in 2004. Informal connections began to resume with meetings last month to discuss how North Korea could handle an outbreak of bird flu.

The two Koreas are technically still at war, but under a cease fire agreement.

During a meeting of the &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20of%20Serbia"&gt;Democratic Party of Serbia&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday, the &lt;a href="w%3ASerbian%20Prime%20Minister"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AVojislav%20Kostunica"&gt;Vojislav Koštunica&lt;/a&gt; said that he will not agree to &lt;a href="w%3AKosovo"&gt;Kosovo's&lt;/a&gt; independence, and that the solution for Kosovo is wide autonomy. "When I say autonomy, that's more than autonomy Kosovo had prior to 1999, but it is still just autonomy and not independence," Koštunica said.

After the &lt;a href="w%3AWar%20in%20Kosovo"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; in 1999, Kosovo was put under &lt;a href="w%3AUNMIK"&gt;UNMIK's&lt;/a&gt; administration, but it still officially remains a province in Serbia. The province's Albanian majority wants full independence from Serbia.

Koštunica said that Kosovo needs a solution acceptable by both parties and that an imposed solution will "jeopardize difficultly achieved stability in Serbia and the region."

Koštunica also reaffirmed his stance on participation of Serbs in Kosovo's institutions: "For now, there is no room for Serbian representatives in institutions of Kosovo." 

The Serbian government had advised Serbs in Kosovo not to vote in the local parliamentary elections held last October. Koštunica said that the degree of participation depends on advancement in protection of human rights of the Serbs remaining in the province.

Kasey Kahne rode into victory early Sunday morning at &lt;a href="w%3ARichmond%20International%20Raceway"&gt;Richmond International Raceway&lt;/a&gt; in the state of Virginia, USA, in his first &lt;a href="w%3ANascar%20Nextel%20Cup"&gt;Nascar Nextel Cup&lt;/a&gt; victory. Kahne, who drives a &lt;a href="w%3ADodge"&gt;Dodge&lt;/a&gt;, and is sponsored by the same company, won automaker competitor &lt;a href="w%3AChevrolet"&gt;Chevrolet&lt;/a&gt;'s sponsored race, the Chevy American Revolution 400.

The 25-year old from &lt;a href="w%3AHuntersville%2C%20North%20Carolina"&gt;Huntersville, North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; had previously gained the &lt;a href="w%3Apole%20position"&gt;pole position&lt;/a&gt; for Saturday's night race on Friday. Early in the race, second-place finisher &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Stewart"&gt;Tony Stewart&lt;/a&gt; took lead from Kahne, continuing on to lead over 100 cumulative laps in the race. At lap 234 of 400, Stewart spun out coming out of the fourth turn, which resulted in Kahne regaining the lead. After two more lead changes between the two, Kahne led the last 7 laps to take the checkered flag.

Points leader &lt;a href="w%3AJimmie%20Johnson"&gt;Jimmie Johnson&lt;/a&gt; crashed his car early into the race, taking a last-place finish. He continues to lead the cup series in points.

Janša has been the leader of SDS since 1993.

The 8th Congress was held under a slogan: "Slovenian Democratic Party - Slovenia on a new road." Out of 450 delegates, 368 voted for Janša and 3 ballots were void. There were no votes against.

The delegates also voted on proposed changes to SDS statute, with overwhelming consensus. New members will no longer be obliged to present proof that they had not cooperated with the secret service of the "totalitarian regime" prior to 1990, when Slovenia declared independence from &lt;a href="w%3AYugoslavia"&gt;Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;.

Delegates reached an agreement that the new political program of the party should reflect current economic conditions, as well as aim at increased growth of the country's economy.

Thousands of Uzbeks are fleeing across &lt;a href="w%3AUzbekistan"&gt;Uzbekistan's&lt;/a&gt; borders to seek refuge in neighboring &lt;a href="w%3AKyrgyzstan"&gt;Kyrgyzstan&lt;/a&gt; despite the border crossings being closed. Their flight is in response to the violence in Andijan.

Thousands are said to have taken to the streets of the city to protest the unfair trial of Muslim activists and draw attention to human rights abuses. A trial of 23 local businessmen on charges of religious extremism triggered the protests. Soldiers opened fire on the demonstrators, killing many. Eyewitnesses have said that they were unarmed civilians.

It is still unknown how many died as a result. Some reports have given the death count as high as 500, with other estimates as low as a dozen. UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw called it "a clear abuse of human rights". Many have expressed doubts that the true figure may ever emerge.

Even with Uzbekistan's borders closed, hundreds are reported to have already crossed into Kyrgyzstan. In Korasuv, an Uzbek border town, government buildings were reported to be on fire in addition to frequent clashes between government police and civilians seeking to cross the border.

Government troops have sealed Andijan, and they are hunting the leaders of protests against the Uzbek government.

Uzbekistan President Islam Karimov blamed Islamic militants for the violence in the eastern city of Andijan. The turbulence led to government troops firing on civilian protesters and rebels, killing at least fifty according to local hospital sources. Independent sources count the number of dead over 100. 

Sunday, President Karimov denied directing his troops to open fire, blaming the outlawed Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir for the deaths following their insurrection.

"I know you want to know who gave the order to fire at them ... No one ordered (troops) to fire at them," Karimov told the news conference in Tashkent on Sunday.

Eyewitnesses reported seeing crowds of unarmed protesters being fired upon by soldiers. Human rights groups have lamented Uzbekistan's poor human rights record of arbitrary arrest and torture. The White House has called for restraint to avoid further bloodshed. The Russian Foreign Ministry has expressed support for Kamirov in the face of what it terms extremism. 

The White House's muted response may reflect the political sensitivity of its air base in southern Uzbekistan which supports its operations in neighbouring Afghanistan. It's widely feared that, should the unrest spread, Uzbekistan may see the popular overthrow of the government as occurred in neighbouring Kyrgystan.

The &lt;a href="w%3AMotion%20Picture%20Association%20of%20America"&gt;Motion Picture Association of America&lt;/a&gt; (MPAA) is suing six websites for hosting &lt;a href="w%3ABitTorrent"&gt;BitTorrent&lt;/a&gt; links to TV programs. 

The MPAA is a movie industry trade group representing most U.S. studios. The MPAA claims that these sites allow users of BitTorrent software to find and download illegal copies of various TV programmes. 

Five of the sites sued are registered in the U.S., and the sixth site is registered in Spain. The sites sued are Shuntv.net, Zonatracker.com, Btefnet.net, Scifi-classics.net, Cddvdheaven.co.uk, and Bragginrights.biz.

According to research by Envisional, recent surveys report downloads of TV programmes are up by 150% in a year. Most of the downloads, 70%, used BitTorrent sites. With the increasing ubiquity of broadband Internet access, popular television shows, which are smaller downloads than movies, often appear within hours of airing on TV. 

The MPAA has filed over 100 lawsuits since December against operators of BitTorrent sites. The MPAA has also sued individuals, but has not reported how many.

MPAA CEO &lt;a href="w%3ADan%20Glickman"&gt;Dan Glickman&lt;/a&gt; told the BBC, "Since we began shutting these sites down, the time that it takes to download a file on BitTorrent has increased exponentially, which means the experience of downloading copyrighted films and TV shows is not what it used to be. We intend to make it even worse. Protecting the television industry is essential."

&lt;/div&gt; 

On May 13, &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Jose"&gt;San Jose&lt;/a&gt; police announced they identified the person whose finger tip &lt;a href="w%3AAnna%20Ayala"&gt;Anna Ayala&lt;/a&gt; claimed she found in a bowl of &lt;a href="w%3AWendy%27s"&gt;Wendy's&lt;/a&gt; chili. Police say that Ayala's husband, James Plascencia, was a work associate of the man who five months ago lost the finger tip in work related accident. 

The owner of the finger, &lt;a href="w%3ABrian%20Paul%20Rossiter"&gt;Brian Paul Rossiter&lt;/a&gt;, lost his finger tip while working at an asphalt company back in December 2004. Police were able to trace it after receiving information from Pat Hogue, who called a Wendy's hot-line. Hogue worked as a cost estimator at an asphalt company at the same time as the co-workers Pascencia and the man who lost the portion of his little finger.

The tipster was unaware, until after Ayala's arrest, of the connection between the Wendy's "finger-pointer" and her husband Plascencia. The finger was given to Ayala's husband as payment for a $50 debt. They do not know how it was transported or preserved during the five months until it turned up in the bowl of chili. More arrests are possible, according to police.

Anna Ayala was arrested on April 21. She has been charged with one count of attempted grand theft in connection with the Wendy’s incident, and one count of grand theft in an unrelated mobile home sale.

<h1>Local elections held in Croatia</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Local%20elections%20held%20in%20Croatia&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Elections for local governments were held in &lt;a href="w%3ACroatia"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt; Sunday. The polls were closed at 19:00 local time (UTC+2). The results are not in yet, but exit polls and preliminary results were published by GONG and State Election Committee.

According to GONG, an NGO observing the elections, &lt;a href="w%3AMilan%20Bandic"&gt;Milan Bandić&lt;/a&gt; can form a government in the city of &lt;a href="w%3AZagreb"&gt;Zagreb&lt;/a&gt;, since his list has won around 46%. This would give the coalition 27 of 51 seats in the capital city. Bandić is a head of the coalition list formed by Social Democrat Party of Croatia (SDP), Croatian Peasant Party (HSS), and Croatian Pensioner Party (HUS). The preliminary results from the State Election Committee show 40.90% for Bandić at 23:30 local time.

&lt;a href="w%3ABranimir%20Glavas"&gt;Branimir Glavaš&lt;/a&gt;'s, who was recently expelled from Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), list seems to be in lead in &lt;a href="w%3AOsijek"&gt;Osijek&lt;/a&gt; according to the exit polls, with 27.24% (which would equal 9 seats in the local parliament). Liberal Party has 18.47% (6 seats), and Croatian Party of Justice is third with 14.5% (4 seats).

According to GONG, Social Democrat Party has a lead in &lt;a href="w%3ASplit"&gt;Split&lt;/a&gt; with 29.02% of votes (10 seats), while Croatian Democratic Union is following with 18.54% (6 seats).

In Sisačko-Moslovačka county parliament, preliminary results show the lead of a list led by SDP with 34.71%, while HDZ, once led by Franjo Tuđman, is second with 30.64%.

Zagreb county parliament is led by coalition of HSS and SDP with 34.35%. HDZ is second with 27.10%, according to preliminary results.

<h1>Ethiopians vote amid opposition charges of fraud</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Ethiopians%20vote%20amid%20opposition%20charges%20of%20fraud&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Millions of voters in &lt;a href="Ethiopia"&gt;Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt; are choosing between a powerful government which has close ties to the West but is considered by some to be totalitarian, and a coalition of little-known opposition parties that has promised greater political freedom and economic development. The democratic ballot is only the third in the country's history.

A small crowd of supporters enthusiastically greeted Prime Minister &lt;a href="Meles%20Zenawi"&gt;Meles Zenawi&lt;/a&gt; as he arrived at the polling station in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAdwa"&gt;Adwa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The town of Adwa, located about 25 kilometers east of the ancient city of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAxum"&gt;Axum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , is also the prime minister's birthplace.

Meles did not address the crowd. But he told reporters he believes the national elections represent an important milestone in Ethiopia's quest to become a full-fledged democratic state.

"I fought to make sure the Ethiopian people have the right to make their decisions," Meles said. "I am now exercising it as an Ethiopian and I am very proud of our achievement."

Meles is seeking his third five-year term in office. His ruling party, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEthiopian%20People%27s%20Revolutionary%20Democratic%20Front"&gt;Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (EPRDF), has been in power for 14 years. During that time, the party has not been challenged in this mostly poor, subsistence farming region.

The party was the only one listed on the ballot paper in Adwa.

The ruling party says none of the major opposition parties bothered to register and campaign for votes in this remote area. But opposition leaders say electoral officials, whom the opposition accuses of being pro-government, would not allow their parties to register or campaign in the area.

The accusation is just one of numerous complaints of irregularity the opposition has lodged.

Hailu Shawel, the head of Ethiopia's opposition Coalition for Unity and Democracy, cast his vote in an opposition stronghold south of the capital &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAddis%20Ababa"&gt;Addis Ababa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Shawl says that in his opinion the balloting has not been the model of democracy that people had hoped for.

"I think disaster is looming. Everywhere there is fraud being perpetrated," said Mr. Shawel. "The marker that they [the voters] were given, it washes off even without water. In other areas, they mark ballot papers with EPDRF signs and giving to people to put in the ballot boxes. And the people are fighting back, saying, 'No, we are not going to do that. Give us the clean paper.' So, the whole process is really jeopardized at the moment."

The government denies that it has been trying to prevent a fair vote, noting that the opposition received unprecedented access to state-owned media and were given permission to stage mass demonstrations ahead of the ballot.

For the first time, more than 300 international observers, including 150 from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and 50 from the &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACarter%20Center"&gt;Carter Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , are in Ethiopia to monitor the elections. They fanned out before dawn to visit some of the 31,000 polling stations set up throughout the country. 

The observers say they plan to investigate reports of any irregularities, but most say they have not seen any serious problems, largely calling the polls honest and fair. Final results are not expected until early June.

In previous elections held in 1995 and 2000, the ruling EPRDF won by overwhelming margins, giving the party a solid majority in parliament.

About 25 million of Ethiopia's 71 million people are registered to vote. The elections are being closely watched in the West as a key test of Ethiopia's commitment to democracy and being a stabilizing force in the volatile Horn of Africa region.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANewsweek"&gt;Newsweek&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; magazine apologized to the victims of last week's deadly protests in &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, which were sparked when a Newsweek report stated that &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; officials defiled the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AQur%27an"&gt;Koran&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

But &lt;a href="Islam"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;ic parties in &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; say the Newsweek apology is a transparent attempt to defuse Muslim anger. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AQazi%20Hussain%20Ahmad"&gt;Qazi Hussain Ahmad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the head of an Islamic party alliance told the BBC on Monday that Newsweek's clarification held no weight. "There have been reports by the prisoners who have been released from &lt;a href="Guantanamo%20Bay"&gt;Guantanamo Bay&lt;/a&gt; of desecration of the holy Koran, and different atrocities perpetrated on them."

On Tuesday Mr.Ahmad said,"Whatever (Newsweek) magazine has done now is under pressure (from the U.S. government)," he said. "It has not denied what it has reported and many people freed from Guantanamo Bay have narrated the same thing."

The Tuesday edition of the &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;i daily newspaper ♡❤the News♡❤ quoted Hafiz Ehsan Saeed, a former Guantanamo Bay detainee, as saying that the Koran was routinely desecrated at Guantanamo.

Reuters reported that Muslims said they suspected that pressure from &lt;a href="Washington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; was behind the magazine's backing off. On Monday, presidential spokesman Scott
McClellan had criticized Newsweek's initial response to the incident, saying it was "puzzling." Later in the day, Newsweek retracted the story which the White House said was a "good first step".

Newsweek defended its reporting and said its investigation is continuing into allegations that the Koran had been desecrated by U.S. personnel.

"Unfortunately relations are so bad at this point that the perception will linger;" said Ibrahim Hooper of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACouncil%20on%20American-Islamic%20Relations"&gt;Council on American-Islamic Relations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . "Many people won't believe it. They'll believe the magazine was pressured into doing a retraction." Hooper said.

"We will not be deceived by this," Sadullah Abu Aman, an Islamic cleric, told Reuters in Afghanistan.
The magazine said it had made a mistake in its May 9th report regarding the accusations, which led to violent anti-American protests in Afghanistan. Over 16 were killed, and more than 100 were injured. While many officials supporting the protests vowed for non-violence, some in the streets threatened to start a religious war against the United States.

Newsweek's Editor, Mark Whitaker, said the magazine's error was reporting confirmation by U.S. military investigators that Guantanamo personnel flushed the Koran down a toilet. The source initially said he had read of the event in a military investigative report, but the source later told the magazine he might have seen the account of the Koran incident in other investigative documents or drafts.

Mr Whitaker told Reuters, "As to whether anything like this happened, we just don't know. We're not saying it absolutely happened but we can't say that it absolutely didn't happen either."

The Newsweek report was not the first public allegation alleging Quran desecration at Guantanamo Bay. News stories came out in August and October 2004, reporting that British citizens who had been released from Guantanamo claimed U.S. guards threw their Qurans into the toilet. Also, in January, 2005, Kristine Huskey, a lawyer representing Guantanamo detainees, said a detainee witnessed a guard tossing a Quran into a toilet.

The final Star Wars film, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AStar%20Wars%20Episode%20III%3A%20Revenge%20of%20the%20Sith"&gt;Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ premiered at the &lt;a href="w%3ACannes%20Festival"&gt;Cannes Festival&lt;/a&gt; on May 15, 2005, with &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Lucas"&gt;George Lucas&lt;/a&gt; and the stars of the movie in attendance at the Grand Theatre Lumiere.

At the subsequent United Kingdom premiere on May 16, 2005, fans turned out in costume. Outside London's &lt;a href="w%3AOscar%20Deutsch"&gt;Odeon&lt;/a&gt; cinema in &lt;a href="w%3ALeicester%20Square"&gt;Leicester Square&lt;/a&gt;, dozens of fans dressed as storm troopers, Jedi knights, and other characters for the film.

The movie is about the temptation of a Jedi knight to the Dark Side of the force, and his fiery transformation into the arch-villain Darth Vader.

♡❤Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith♡❤ is scheduled for general release in the United States on May 19, 2005, and is rated PG-13.

<h3>Reactions from &lt;a href="w%3Afilm%20critic"&gt;film critic&lt;/a&gt;s</h3>
<h4>Peter Bradshaw</h4>

Peter Bradshaw from ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Guardian"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ described the climax of the film as following "what seems like seven hours of CGI action as dramatically weightless as the movement of tropical fish in an aquarium". Bradshaw said the leading characters "gaze out over massive futuristic cityscapes resembling the photorealist artwork once used for 1970s sci-fi paperbacks: pointy buildings with swarms of pointy aircraft criss-crossing overhead, often bathed in crimson sunsets". 

He described &lt;a href="w%3AEwan%20McGregor"&gt;Ewan McGregor&lt;/a&gt;'s accent as "a simperingly lifeless Rada-English accent, a muddled and misconceived backdating of the Guinness original", and said of &lt;a href="w%3AHayden%20Christensen"&gt;Hayden Christensen&lt;/a&gt; that "If Princess Diana had gone to the Dark Side, she would have looked a lot like this". 

Describing &lt;a href="w%3AJimmy%20Smits"&gt;Jimmy Smits&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ASamuel%20L.%20Jackson"&gt;Samuel L. Jackson&lt;/a&gt; as "acting as if on some kind of medication", &lt;a href="w%3ANatalie%20Portman"&gt;Natalie Portman&lt;/a&gt; as "incorrigibly clunky", Bradshaw concluded that the film was "a product of George Lucas's overweening production giant Industrial Light and Magic. No magic, little light, but an awful lot of heavy industry." 

<h4>Wendy Ide</h4>

Wendy Ide from &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Times"&gt;The Times&lt;/a&gt; commented that "any spark of humour or irreverence that might have been present in the earlier films has been all but extinguished", and accused the film of being carpeted by "a bombastic and overbearing" musical score.

Ide concluded that the film was "a textbook example of style over substance and, more importantly, soul".

&lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft Corporation&lt;/a&gt; announced plans to launch a new security product later this year, named ♡❤Windows OneCare♡❤.

Product features are to include &lt;a href="w%3AAnti-virus%20software"&gt;anti-virus&lt;/a&gt; software capabilities, a new &lt;a href="w%3AFirewall%20%28networking%29"&gt;firewall&lt;/a&gt; and PC tune ups. The PC tune ups include utilities for improved backup and restore capabilities, and easy access to Windows PC maintenance tools for file repair and hard drive clean up.

The major elements of the product are:
<ul>
BULLET::::- A firewall that (unlike Windows Firewall but like third party personal firewall products for Windows) prevents unauthorized programs from making outgoing connections
BULLET::::- Anti-spyware, based upon &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20AntiSpyware"&gt;Microsoft AntiSpyware&lt;/a&gt;
BULLET::::- Virus protection, based upon technology bought by Microsoft from the Romanian company GeCAD
BULLET::::- Scheduled disc cleanup and defragmentation.
BULLET::::- Automatic backup to writable CD or DVD.

</ul>
An early beta version of product, not including the anti-spyware capability, has already been released to Microsoft employees. A public beta is scheduled for later in 2005.

Microsoft plans to make ♡❤Windows OneCare♡❤ available to customers for a yearly subscription fee.

Recently, Microsoft bought Giant software, makers of antivirus and spyware prevention software. Windows Anti-Spyware software is already built on this system.

<h1>French Workers stay at home for Whit Monday</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=French%20Workers%20stay%20at%20home%20for%20Whit%20Monday&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

In &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, workers by the millions stayed at home during the &lt;a href="w%3AWhit%20Monday"&gt;Whit Monday&lt;/a&gt; holiday despite the government's cancellation of the traditional &lt;a href="w%3APentecost"&gt;Pentecost&lt;/a&gt; public holiday. Some acted in defiance of the government's decision, while some took leave or were put on forced leave by their employers due to uncertainties of public transportation.

Following the 2003 &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEuropean%20Heat%20Wave%20of%202003"&gt;heat wave&lt;/a&gt;, which caused the deaths of an estimated 13,000 elderly people in France, the administration of prime minister &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AJean-Pierre%20Raffarin"&gt;Jean-Pierre Raffarin&lt;/a&gt; has proposed the suppression of one day of public holiday in order to use the supplemental generated tax for a fund for the caring of the elderly. 

Whit Monday was selected because, in normal years, France has several public holidays in May. Furthermore, attendance of religious celebrations is low, so holidays of a religious origin are nowadays generally mere family reunions.

However, the reception of this new working day was mixed. The administration says it promotes solidarity with the elderly. Trade unions and opposition groups argue that the measure is an ill-conceived stunt aimed at hiding the government's bad handling of the problems of the elderly. 

For instance, many remember that in 1956, the government created a tax (the ♡❤vignette♡❤) on motor vehicles, allegedly for funding measures for the elderly. But in 1973, the products of this tax came, as any other tax, into the government's general fund.

With this measure, the French government intends to raise 2 billion &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEuro"&gt;€&lt;/a&gt; to be donated to a new public establishment, the "national fund for solidarity for autonomy." The new fund would be chartered to deal with losses of self-sufficiency of elderly or handicapped people. 1.2 billion € are earmarked for elderly people, 0.8 for the handicapped.

Trade unions had called for strikes in urban public transportation and paralyzed traffic in 27 cities, including &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AClermont-Ferrand"&gt;Clermont-Ferrand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ALille"&gt;Lille&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AMontpellier"&gt;Montpellier&lt;/a&gt; ou &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AStrasbourg"&gt;Strasbourg&lt;/a&gt;. However, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASNCF"&gt;SNCF&lt;/a&gt; (the national railway operator) did not strike and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARATP"&gt;RATP&lt;/a&gt; (the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AParis"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; transportation authority) suffered only minor disturbances, though both are normally known for their frequent and disturbing strikes. 

SNCF considered the day as a holiday for payroll purposes and instead increased the work day by 1'52", a measure that majority leader &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ANicolas%20Sarkozy"&gt;Nicolas Sarkozy&lt;/a&gt; considered shocking and contrary to the objectives of the government.

The protests are also widely considered to be motivated by the unpopularity of the administration of president &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AJacques%20Chirac"&gt;Jacques Chirac&lt;/a&gt; and prime minister &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AJean-Pierre%20Raffarin"&gt;Jean-Pierre Raffarin&lt;/a&gt;. Recent statistics show a five year-high for unemployment at 10.2%. 

This discontent may result in a majority of "no" in the vote for the ratification of the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ATreaty%20establishing%20a%20Constitution%20for%20Europe"&gt;Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Uzbek%20rebel%20leader%20on%20horseback%20wants%20an%20Islamic%20state&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Bakhtiyor Rakhimov, a rebel leader on horseback who claims control of an Uzbek town said the rebels are intent upon building an Islamic state.

"We will be building an Islamic state here in accordance with the Quran; the town is in the hands of people. People are tired of slavery," Rakhimov told The Associated Press on May 18th. "We will turn this land into gardens," he said. "If I turn this land into a good place, if everybody here will have plenty of food on the table, it will spread further."

Zakir Almatov, the Uzbek Interior Minister denied Rakhimov's claims. "It's all sheer nonsense, everything is normal there, if anything had happened there, I already would have been there." he said. But there were no Uzbek government officials to be found in &lt;a href="w%3AKorasuv"&gt;Korasuv&lt;/a&gt;.

When asked whether the rebels belonged to an Islamic group Rakhimov said no, that "We are just people, we just follow the Quran."

When asked if he was afraid that government forces would be back to regain control of the town he said, "Soldiers and police are also sons of this people. We don't have weapons, but if they come and attack us we will fight even with knives."

&lt;a href="w%3AUzbekistan"&gt;Uzbekistan&lt;/a&gt; soldiers sealed off the eastern border town after locals took over government buildings last Saturday.
The unrest spread from nearby Andijan, where local sources said several hundred people died when troops opened fire on protesters on Friday. 

Some refugees near Korasuv said troops shot at them as they tried to cross the border into Kyrgyzstan - and some died. 

U.K. Foreign Minister Jack Straw said his Uzbek counterpart had pledged to allow diplomats access to Andijan on Tuesday.

As the court was announcing the final decision on the fate of Russia's petroleum king, &lt;a href="w%3AMikhail%20Khodorkovsky"&gt;Mikhail Khodorkovsky&lt;/a&gt;, hundreds of people gathered near the court house to voice their opinion on the matter. A rally was supported by several Russian political parties and groups, including &lt;a href="w%3AUnion%20of%20Right%20Forces"&gt;Union of Right Forces&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AYabloko"&gt;Yabloko&lt;/a&gt;, Oborona, &lt;a href="w%3APora"&gt;Pora&lt;/a&gt;!, Smena and others. 

Among the people who attended the meeting were &lt;a href="w%3AGarry%20Kasparov"&gt;Garry Kasparov&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AIrina%20Khakamada"&gt;Irina Khakamada&lt;/a&gt;. The total number of participants, according to officials is estimated at 700 people. The involved parties claim around 1000.

The crowd was standing in front of the court house, waving flags of political groups mentioned above and chanting political slogans aimed at the allegedly unfair trial and at the Russian president, &lt;a href="w%3AVladimir%20Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt;. Among the chants were:

<ul>
BULLET::::- "Svobodu!" (Freedom [to Khodorkovsky]) -
BULLET::::- "Misha go home" ( being the short form of )
BULLET::::- "One, two, three, Putin go away"
BULLET::::- "Doloi vlast chekistov" (Down with the &lt;a href="w%3Acheka"&gt;Chekist&lt;/a&gt;s' authority, referring to Putin's &lt;a href="w%3AKGB"&gt;KGB&lt;/a&gt; past) -

</ul>
Some cars passing by expressed their solidarity with the crowds by sound signalling, which crowd appreciated with louder chanting. Some activists rode passing by trams and trolleybuses, waving "Freedom to MBKh" tees and flags from the windows.

The meeting lasted for two hours, until &lt;a href="w%3AMilitsiya"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; ordered the crowds to go away when their permit expired. Many refused, and the militia had to resort to force. 20-30 people were arrested, including some organizers.

Official results of the local elections held in &lt;a href="w%3ACroatia"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt; yesterday are still pending, but according to exit polls and preliminary results the currently ruling party, Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) has performed poorly. 

HDZ has a lead in nine of 21 counties, and the second largest party, Social Democrat Party of Croatia (SDP) has a clear lead in three out of four big cities, including &lt;a href="w%3AZagreb"&gt;Zagreb&lt;/a&gt;. Four years ago, HDZ won 15 counties. &lt;a href="w%3AIvo%20Sanader"&gt;Ivo Sanader&lt;/a&gt;, the current Prime Minister of Croatia and the leader of HDZ, said at 23:00 local time yesterday: "HDZ is the winner of local elections. Our politics on state level was approved."

Milan Bandić, in front of the list of SDP, Croatian Peasant Party (HSS) and Croatian Party of Pensioners (HSU) will be able to form a government in the Zagreb assembly on his own. Most of the other places will probably see formation of coalitions, since hardly anybody is receiving majority support.

The man was wearing a formal black suit and white shirt with all labels removed, and was soaking wet, as if having been in the sea. 

He has not spoken a word since he was found, but when given pencil and paper he drew a piano. Seeing the picture of the piano, the medical staff at the Medway Maritime Hospital where he was admitted showed him the piano in the hospital chapel. To their amazement he sat at the instrument and played &lt;a href="w%3Aclassical%20music"&gt;classical&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Apop%20music"&gt;pop music&lt;/a&gt; for several hours. 

Many press reports have emphasized the piano playing, and the man has been labelled "The Piano Man" by many news services, although the hospital staff has been calling him "Mr. X." 

However, the chaplain of the hospital, the Reverend Steve Spencer, said the man "is not the virtuoso that he has been portrayed in the press. He knows a small number of tunes and plays them over and over. I recognized some &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Lennon"&gt;John Lennon&lt;/a&gt; and a snippet from Tchaikovsky's ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASwan%20Lake"&gt;Swan Lake&lt;/a&gt;♡❤."

The man also pointed to a flag of &lt;a href="w%3ASweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; when shown an atlas, initially leading the hospital staff to believe he was from Sweden. To date this lead has not panned out. A different account from the National Missing Persons Helpline (NMPH) indicated that the man actually drew the flag.

The NMPH is appealing to anyone who recognizes the man to contact Teri on +44 20 8392 4509. All calls will be treated as confidential. The NMPH can also be reached at +44 500 700700. Emails can also be sent to &lt;a href="mailto%3Aid%40missingpersons.org"&gt;id@missingpersons.org&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Identification</h2>

According to the man's social worker, Michael Camp, all initial leads (including the Swedish flag information) have gone cold.

One notable lead on May 17 came from a &lt;a href="w%3APoland"&gt;Polish&lt;/a&gt; man called Darius Dydymski who claimed that the man is a &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; street musician he worked with in &lt;a href="w%3ANice"&gt;Nice&lt;/a&gt; named Steven Villa Masson(e). However, this lead turned up cold on May 18 when Masson's sister, Julie Villa Massone said, "I saw my brother yesterday in Nice." Also, AFP found him living in Nice near the train station.

A Wikinews contributor believes that the person referenced is an acquaintance of his named Geoffrey Betts. Betts is an actor who is a citizen of the U.K. Betts has lived much of his life in the &lt;a href="w%3ADallas%2C%20Texas"&gt;Dallas, Texas&lt;/a&gt; area and has spent some time recently in &lt;a href="w%3ALouisville%2C%20Kentucky"&gt;Louisville, Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;. 

A visual comparison of the person in the various news articles can be compared to Geoff's website (listed in External links below). The source reported his findings to the U.K. authorities several hours before this posting.

At this time, no leads have been verified.

The &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; announced on Monday a trial of their new Interactive Media Player (iMP). 

Five thousand participants from across the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;U.K.&lt;/a&gt; were selected for this trial. Participants in the trial will be able to download selected BBC television and radio programmes. Approximately 190 hours of TV shows, 310 hours of radio programmes, and some feature films and local programming are to be made available for download. 

&lt;a href="w%3AAshley%20Highfield"&gt;Ashley Highfield&lt;/a&gt; is the BBC's director of new media and technology. Highfield has said that this program "Could just be the &lt;a href="w%3AiTunes"&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt; for the broadcast industry, enabling our audience to access our TV and radio programmes on their terms - anytime, any place, any how."

The BBC is funded by a mandatory &lt;a href="w%3ATV%20licence"&gt;licence fee&lt;/a&gt; on all televisions in the U.K. The fee is £126.50 a year for colour TV and £42 a year for monochrome TV.

Pop starlet &lt;a href="w%3AKylie%20Minogue"&gt;Kylie Minogue&lt;/a&gt; has announced through her management that she has an early stage of &lt;a href="w%3Abreast%20cancer"&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;. The 36-year-old has said she will be going through the treatment in her native Australia. Due to early diagnosis the singer stands a good chance of making a full recovery.

Kylie, who had spent the past week in &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, has revealed that due to the cancer the rest of her ♡❤Showgirl♡❤ tour of &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; will be postponed and her appearance at this year's &lt;a href="w%3AGlastonbury%20festival"&gt;Glastonbury festival&lt;/a&gt; will be cancelled.

The ♡❤Showgirl♡❤ tour was due to hit &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;, Melbourne, &lt;a href="w%3ABrisbane"&gt;Brisbane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAdelaide"&gt;Adelaide&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APerth"&gt;Perth&lt;/a&gt; in June. However despite the cancellation, ticket holders are advised to hang on to tickets as new dates may be announced.

Following accusations issued by the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;United States Senate&lt;/a&gt; Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI), British Member of Parliament &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AGeorge%20Galloway"&gt;George Galloway&lt;/a&gt; and Senator &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ACharles%20Pasqua"&gt;Charles Pasqua&lt;/a&gt; of France have vehemently denied any wrongdoing.

♡❤♡George Galloway♡❤♡ declared:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
♡❤I've now had a chance to read the report which was compiled without this Senate committee asking me a single question about these absurd allegations. I repeat once more. I have never traded or benefited from any oil deals with Iraq.♡❤
&lt;p&gt;
♡❤One of the companies named, with ostensible links to me-- Aredio Petroleum-- I have never heard of until today and I have certainly had no dealings with. The other company, Middle East Advanced Semiconductors, was owned by Fawaz Zureikat, who was the chairman of the Mariam Appeal. It is well-known that Mr Zureikat traded with Iraq but he did not do so on my behalf. I have not received a penny piece or any oil voucher from Iraq, directly or indirectly.♡❤
&lt;p&gt;
♡❤You would have thought that natural justice would have demanded that these allegations would have-- must have been!-- put to me, but they haven't been. Senator Joseph McCarthy would have been proud of this committee.♡❤
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On May 17, Galloway appeared before the U.S. senatorial panel and vehemently denied any wrongdoing in a tone seldom used in a senatorial hearing. He accused the U.S. administration of creating a "smoke screen" to divert attention away from the situation in Iraq. He also declared, "The biggest sanctions busters were not me or Russian politicians or French politicians. The real sanctions busters were your own companies with the connivance of your own government." 

Galloway denied receiving any money out of the scheme. Galloway demanded, "What counts is, where's the money, senator? Who paid me hundreds of thousands of dollars? The answer to that is nobody," while glaring toward U.S. senator &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ANorm%20Coleman"&gt;Norm Coleman&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="%3Aw%3AUS%20Republican%20Party"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AMinnesota"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;), according to a New York Times report.

Galloway also accused the US senators, especially senator Coleman, of shoddy standards of justice. He claimed they have already ruled him guilty, and that they rely on dubious evidence and wrongful or coerced testimonies. 

Galloway declared:
&lt;blockquote&gt;♡❤You have my name on lists provided to you... by the convicted bank robber and fraudster and con man &lt;a href="w%3AAhmed%20Chalabi"&gt;Ahmed Chalabi&lt;/a&gt;, who many people, to their credit, in your country now realize played a decisive role in leading your country into the disaster in Iraq.♡❤
&lt;p&gt;♡❤In these circumstances, knowing what the world knows about how you treat prisoners in &lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Ghraib%20prison"&gt;Abu Ghraib prison&lt;/a&gt;, in Bagram Air Base [Afghanistan], in &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20Bay"&gt;Guantanamo Bay&lt;/a&gt; -- including, if I may say, British citizens being held in those places -- I'm not sure how much credibility anyone would put on anything you manage to get from a prisoner in those circumstances.♡❤&lt;/blockquote&gt;
♡❤♡Charles Pasqua♡❤♡ also denies any personal wrongdoing in the case. Pasqua indicated that he was "serene" and that he hoped the investigations by the U.S. Senate would probe the matter to the bottom. 

Pasqua judged the situation detrimental to relationships between the United States and France. For this reason, Pasqua declared that he had asked the president of the French Senate for the creation of an investigation commission, wishing that the French and U.S. senatorial commissions should collaborate.

Pasqua declared himself convinced that misconduct took place in the oil-for-food program, and that it was probable that some French people were involved. He then wished that they should be sought and prosecuted. "If one wants to find the origin of the financial streams, one can do so." Pasqua mentioned the Swiss company Genmar, which the U.S. report claims to have served as Pasqua's intermediary.

Pasqua denied information presented as facts in the report. For instance, he denied having met &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ATariq%20Aziz"&gt;Tariq Aziz&lt;/a&gt;, former Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq.

Pasqua pointed out that nothing in the senatorial evidence indicates that he had benefited from vouchers, only that one of his former advisers, Bernard Guillet, had received oil allocations in his name. From December 2000 onwards, allocations meant for Pasqua ceased and were replaced by allocations to Bernard Guillet. 

Guillet was arrested by French authorities in April in connection with abuses under the oil-for-food program. Mr Guillet has been put under formal investigation for allegedly participating in a system of occult kickbacks and fees between 1996 and 2001 involving major French companies, including &lt;a href="w%3ATotal%20%28company%29"&gt;Total&lt;/a&gt;. He is suspected of having received amounts of money without good explanation from an intermediary specialized in the resale of Iraqi oil.

Eleven protesters were arrested demonstrating outside the &lt;a href="w%3ACouncil%20of%20Europe"&gt;Council of Europe&lt;/a&gt; conference in &lt;a href="w%3AWarsaw"&gt;Warsaw&lt;/a&gt; on Monday May 16, including an Indymedia correspondent. The activists claim the arrests are an attempt to suppress free speech.

The protesters organized their march, beginning from &lt;a href="w%3AWarsaw%20Palace%20of%20Culture%20and%20Science"&gt;Warsaw Palace of Culture and Science&lt;/a&gt; and walking to the Royal Square and the Royal Castle, where the Council of Europe was meeting. The council's meeting was believed to be concerning human rights conditions but attended by officials they accuse of human rights violations. 

The demonstrators were unable to get into the Royal Square, so they had to stop their march at Krakowskie Przedmiescie Street. A large police presence was on hand to oversee the demonstrations.

As the demonstrations were ending, police arrested 11 activists, including Grzegorz Prujszczyk, who had been filming the events. Three members of &lt;a href="w%3AAmnesty%20International"&gt;Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt; were among those detained. All were released by Wednesday, May 18. 

Mr. Prujszczyk has been charged with assaulting a police officer, which could carry a sentence up to 10 years in jail. &lt;a href="w%3AReporters%20Without%20Borders"&gt;Reporters Without Borders&lt;/a&gt; (Reporters sans frontières, or ♡❤♡RSF♡❤♡) report Mr. Prujszczyk was held for 39 hours, his tapes were reviewed, and though released he is under police surveillance and must report to the police weekly.

Activists and journalists believe the charge against Mr. Prujszczyk, as well as the charges against the other detainees, are attempts to suppress freedom of speech and the press in the country.

"This behaviour by police is a threat to press freedom. Polish journalists and other media workers should be able to cover every type of event, even those seen as sensitive, such as opposition demonstrations against the government's support for the war in Iraq," RSF said.

Indymedia Poland claims, "We have indisputable evidence of Grzegorz Prujszczyk's innocence (photos, film recordings, witness statements), which we can provide to any interested journalists. We are convinced that the detention of this Indymedia reporter is because of his journalist work carried out during the demonstration. This is an obvious violation of freedom of speech and a constraint against independence of the media." &lt;a href="http%3A//pl.indymedia.org/pl/2005/05/14013.shtml%23english"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Fans of Italian football clubs &lt;a href="w%3AA.S.%20Roma"&gt;Roma&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AS.S.%20Lazio"&gt;Lazio&lt;/a&gt; are asking for ticket reimbursement, after the city rivals played 0:0 Sunday. After a good chance of Roma scoring in the opening minutes of the match, the entire game was played in the middle of the field and neither team seemed eager to score. 

Accusations were taken further as the Italian Consumer Union, Codacons, called for fans to ask for their money back, since the game result was allegedly fixed. Both teams are close to the bottom of Seria A table, and a point each will almost secure that they do not drop out of the first league. 

Italian media seems unified in opinion that this was the worst city derby ever played. Some of the headlines were "Derby of shame" and "Never again like this."

Consob, an institution monitoring the work of the regional Stock Market, announced they will take action against both teams as they have shares on market.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Tense%20panel%20discussion%20on%20Srebrenica%20held%20in%20Belgrade&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A panel discussion titled "Truth about &lt;a href="w%3ASrebrenica"&gt;Srebrenica&lt;/a&gt;" held at the law school at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Belgrade"&gt;University of Belgrade&lt;/a&gt; yesterday almost turned into a physical fight between panel participants and several dozen protesters.

The panel was organized by a nationalist student organization Nomokanon to mark what they consider, according to their promotional posters, "the anniversary of the liberation of Srebrenica." According to the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Criminal%20Tribunal%20for%20the%20former%20Yugoslavia"&gt;International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt; (ICTY), Bosnian Serb forces murdered more than 7,000 &lt;a href="w%3ABosniaks"&gt;Bosniaks&lt;/a&gt; in 1995 in Srebrenica, during the &lt;a href="w%3ABosnian%20War%23Bosnian%20War"&gt;war in Bosnia&lt;/a&gt;. 

General Radislav Krstić was convicted for his involvement and sentenced to serve 46 years in prison. Two other suspects, &lt;a href="w%3ARadovan%20Karadzic"&gt;Radovan Karadžić&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARatko%20Mladic"&gt;Ratko Mladić&lt;/a&gt; are still on the run. 

Protesters included activists of political parties &lt;a href="w%3ACivic%20Alliance%20of%20Serbia"&gt;Civic Alliance of Serbia&lt;/a&gt;, G17+ and Social Democrat Union as well as Non-Governmental Organization (NGOs) Women in Black, Kapiraj-Kopiraj and Youth Initiative. Their activity delayed the start for half an hour. Organizations which protested this forum claim that Serbia should face its involvement in Bosnia and should not deny allegations of crimes committed by Serbian forces. 

Many of the participants were wearing t-shirts with pictures of Radovan Karadžić followed by text "Serbian hero." Some wore t-shirts of the Serbian nationalist organization Obraz.

The panel began at 19:30 local time, but the first ten minutes passed in a verbal fight between protestors and participants. Protesters were booing, and participants responded by calling them &lt;a href="w%3AUstasa"&gt;Ustashe&lt;/a&gt;, faggots, &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Soros"&gt;Soros'&lt;/a&gt; workers, and traitors. Most protesters then left the room.

According to B92, one young man who protested said that security was "very unpleasant". He was quoted as saying: "[Security] told us things like: 'What's up, Croats' and 'Faggots, we will beat you up now.'"

Four speakers took part in the panel: 
<ul>
BULLET::::- Milivoje Ivanišević, the president of the Center for Research of Crimes Against Serbs
BULLET::::- Radovan Radinović, a retired army general
BULLET::::- Dragoslav Ognjanović, Milošević's attorney
BULLET::::- And journalist Ljiljana Bulatović.

</ul>
Participants said that there was no genocide in Srebrenica but that only Muslim soldiers were killed, which was misrepresented to the public to bring international military action against Serbs. One participant said that only 2,500 people were killed, and that only 500 of them could have been shot in a fusillade, since there were only so many blindfolds found next to bodies.

One of the speakers congratulated Nomokanon for talking about "the truth, so nobody can force us to be ashamed of what deserves our respect."

University of Belgrade's Faculty of Law postponed the panel once and did not officially endorse it.

On Tuesday, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.jrebelde.cubaweb.cu"&gt;Juventud Rebelde&lt;/a&gt; reported that the Central Administration of Cuba is organizing a migration to free and open source software. The announcement was made during a free software workshop organized at the "Convención Internacional Informática 2005" by the director of the state office of information technology, Roberto del Puerto.

The plan is to use the Linux operating system as a base, though the administration currently uses Microsoft Windows. The transition is planned to be slow and involves organizational changes, development and creating a legal framework. 

The Linux user base in Cuba is around 1,500 people and has its own Linux distribution. Cuba also has some free software developers and the University of Information Science, with over 6,000 students, has committed one department for the development of programs for Linux which is a good move towards open source

On May 17, 2005, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Assembly%20of%20Kuwait"&gt;National Assembly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;a href="Kuwait"&gt;Kuwait&lt;/a&gt; passed, by a majority of 35 to 23 (with 1 absetention), an amendment to its electoral law that would allow women to vote and to stand as parliamentary candidates. Commentators predict that this will increase the number of eligible voters from approximately 139,000 to approximately 339,000, out of a population of approximately 960,000.

"We made it. This is history," prominent activist Roula al-Dashti told reporters. "Our target is the parliamentary polls in 2007. I'm starting my campaign from today." Kuwait becomes the fourth Gulf country where women as well as men can vote in elections after &lt;a href="Bahrain"&gt;Bahrain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Oman"&gt;Oman&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Qatar"&gt;Qatar&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="Saudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt; holds strictly limited, male-only elections. "I hope they are talking about separate ballot boxes and not the imposition of Islamic dress... which infringes on personal freedoms," Kuwait University academic Nada al-Muttawa said.

"This is a historic moment for women," Sheikha Suad al-Sabah, a member of the ruling family, said.

On Tuesday, the &lt;a href="w%3ARomania"&gt;Romanian&lt;/a&gt; parliament ratified the country's accession treaty to the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;, which was signed in &lt;a href="w%3ALuxembourg"&gt;Luxembourg&lt;/a&gt; on April 25 of this year. The ratification occurred under a joint session of both chambers of the Romanian parliament. The treaty was approved unanimously, with all 434 parliamentarians voting in favour.

The approval of the treaty in the Romanian parliament was considered a ceremonial step, since it was expected to be ratified by a very wide margin. But it was also seen as yet another important step on Romania's road towards the European Union. 

The speaker of the parliament, &lt;a href="w%3AAdrian%20Nastase"&gt;Adrian Năstase&lt;/a&gt;, who was also Romania's Prime Minister between 2000 and 2004, said, "This is a historic moment for Romania". While current Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ACalin%20Popescu-Tariceanu"&gt;Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu&lt;/a&gt; stated, "The ratification of the treaty is a turning-point in Romania's political history."

Romania's parliamentary ratification of the treaty comes after &lt;a href="w%3ABulgaria"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt;, which also signed the treaty in Luxembourg, ratified it on May 11. Alongside Bulgaria and Romania, the treaty has already been ratified by seven current member states of the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;. In order for the treaty to come into effect, all EU members must approve it. 

Both Bulgaria and Romania, which are currently accession countries of the European Union, are set to join the EU on January 1, 2007.

&lt;a href="w%3AVISA"&gt;VISA&lt;/a&gt; has opened a regional office in &lt;a href="w%3ABucharest"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARomania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; to represent and co-ordinate the activities of the company in &lt;a href="w%3ARomania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABulgaria"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt;. The Bucharest bureau is the eighth office in the Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa (CEMEA) region, made up of 84 countries.

The use of VISA cards in &lt;a href="w%3ARomania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; is currently growing at a fast rate. VISA has 21 member banks in Romania which have issued a total of 2.8 million cards.

The general director of VISA Southeastern Europe and North Africa, Tony Brogna, said that VISA cards embedded with chips would soon be launched on the Romanian market. This comes at a time when several Romanian banks have stated that they are planning to start issuing chip-embedded cards from June this year. Additionally, seven of the eight &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Europe"&gt;Central European&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABaltic%20states"&gt;Baltic states&lt;/a&gt; which joined the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; in 2004 already use VISA cards embedded with chips.

&lt;a href="w%3ARomania"&gt;Romania's&lt;/a&gt; National Road 66 (DN 66) will face traffic restrictions between the cities of &lt;a href="w%3AT%C3%A2rgu%20Jiu"&gt;Târgu Jiu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APetro%C5%9Fani"&gt;Petroşani&lt;/a&gt;, in the southern part of the country, between May 17 and November 15 due to &lt;a href="w%3Ahydroelectricity"&gt;hydroelectrical&lt;/a&gt; operations on the Jiu river. The traffic restrictions mean that traffic will not be able to access the road on Tuesdays and Thursdays of every week, between the hours of 22:00 and 06:00.

The National Company of Motorways and National Roads issued a press release informing motorists of alternative routes to take, including the route Târgu Jiu-Râmnicu Vâlcea-Brezoi-Sibiu-Simeria-Haţeg-Petroşani, Târgu Jiu-Drobeta Turnu Severin-Caransebeş-Haţeg-Petroşani and Târgu Jiu-Filiaşi-Drobeta Turnu Severin-Orşova-Caransebeş-Haţeg-Petroşani.

&lt;a href="w%3AAir%20France"&gt;Air France&lt;/a&gt; has announced that it plans to launch its fifth daily flight on the &lt;a href="w%3AParis"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3ABucharest"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt; route on June 6. Air France currently flies from Paris (&lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20de%20Gaulle%20International%20Airport"&gt;Charles de Gaulle&lt;/a&gt;) to Bucharest (&lt;a href="w%3AHenri%20Coanda%20International%20Airport"&gt;Henri Coandă&lt;/a&gt;) and back four times a day, under a codesharing agreement with &lt;a href="w%3ATAROM"&gt;TAROM&lt;/a&gt;, Romania's largest airline. 

The extra flight is to be operated with an &lt;a href="w%3AAirbus"&gt;Airbus&lt;/a&gt; 318 aircraft, which has a capacity of 94 passengers.

Air France will also adjust its Paris-Bucharest timetable so that possibilities for transfer at Paris Charles de Gaulle airport can be maximised. This would enable passengers flying from Bucharest to Paris to connect to destinations such as Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo or Buenos Aires with very little waiting time. 

The fifth daily flight is also to be run under a codesharing agreement with TAROM &amp;mdash; the two carriers have decided to allow the transfer of tickets between them.

A former aide to French senator &lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Pasqua"&gt;Charles Pasqua&lt;/a&gt;, whose name was cited by a recent report by a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;United States Senate&lt;/a&gt; investigation panel, has admitted that the Iraqi government had intended to reward Mr Pasqua with a grant of oil through the &lt;a href="w%3Aoil%20for%20food"&gt;oil for food&lt;/a&gt; program.

The aide, Bernard Guillet, was arrested in April 2005 and was put under formal criminal investigation on April 28 by French judge Philippe Courroye, under the charges of egregious influence peddling and of being an accessory to an abuse of corporate belongings. He is suspected of having received vouchers for buying Iraqi oil from the regime of &lt;a href="w%3ASaddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt;, which he then allegedly sold to oil companies, to an amount of 5 million barrels. 

Mr Pasqua, according to some sources, would have been the beneficiary of 10.8 million barrels. According to a &lt;a href="w%3ACIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; report, the profit would have been between 0.15&lt;a href="w%3AEuro"&gt;€&lt;/a&gt; and 0.85€ per barrel.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABrasilia%2C%20Brazil"&gt;Brasilia, Brazil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
Thousands of members of the Brazilian &lt;a href="w%3ALandless%20Workers%27%20Movement"&gt;Landless Workers' Movement&lt;/a&gt; (MST) completed their march to &lt;a href="w%3ABrasilia"&gt;Brasilia&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, having started their 238 km journey on May 1. They demanded President &lt;a href="w%3ALuiz%20Inacio%20Lula%20da%20Silva"&gt;Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva&lt;/a&gt; meet land reform promises, and protested against the U.S. government and President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;.

The Brazilian government news agency &lt;a href="w%3Aradiobras"&gt;Agencia Brasil&lt;/a&gt; reported that about 12,000 members of MST protested in front of the U.S. Embassy in Brasilia. The group gathered garbage and burnt with it an American flag. According to Rosana Fernandes, an MST representative, they were protesting against American culture, politics and corporations.

Representatives of MST also met with Brazilian President Lula da Silva. According to Agencia Brasil, they presented four demands to the government: the restructuring of the National Institute of Colonization and Agrarian Reform (Incra), the execution of the National Plan for Agrarian Reform announced in 2003, the creation of a special line of credit, and changes in the definition of unproductive land for expropriation. MST claims that they reached an agreement with Lula, and that he agreed to spend about half, or 700 million reais ($282 million USD), of the land reform budget he froze in 2005. Agrarian Reform Minister Miguel Rossetto denied that a deal had already been made, but said that the meeting had been positive and a proposal would be offered to the MST on Wednesday.

During the protests some members of MST conflicted with police forces in Brasilia. According to the police, 20 policemen were badly injured and were hospitalized. Also according to the police, the incident started after some MST members attacked a police car near the Palace of Justice. A police officer that left the car to talk to the crowd was assaulted with punches and kicks. The mounted police came to help the trapped officers and dispersed the crowd. MST reported 32 of their members injured in the incident, although independent news sources report around 20. 

The MST march to Brasilia was organized by &lt;a href="w%3AVia%20Campesina"&gt;Via Campesina&lt;/a&gt;, an international organization in support of rural worker's rights and sustainable agriculture.

The MST's leader João Pedro Stedile said that the MST must return home with their batteries recharged and increase the occupation of land in Brazil. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.radiobras.gov.br/materia_i_2004.php%3Fmateria%3D225899%26amp%3Beditoria%3D"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Tropical Storm Adrian, the first named storm of the &lt;a href="w%3A2005%20Pacific%20hurricane%20season"&gt;2005 Pacific hurricane season&lt;/a&gt;, formed 440 miles (710 km) southwest of &lt;a href="w%3AGuatemala"&gt;Guatemala&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AEl%20Salvador"&gt;El Salvador&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday. The storm is expected to track northeast towards &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20America"&gt;Central America&lt;/a&gt;. 

The government of El Salvador has upgraded the tropical storm watch to a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch for all of El Salvador. A tropical storm watch remains in effect for the entire Pacific coast of Guatemala. The government of Honduras has issued a tropical storm watch for the Pacific coast of Honduras, including the Gulf of Fonseca.

As of 11 am Pacific Time on Thursday, it was moving northeast at 9 mph (15 km/h) with maximum sustained wind speeds of 75 mph (120 km/h), with gusts at higher speeds. It is expected to strengthen slightly, possibly becoming a minimal hurricane at landfall.

The current location of the center of the storm is &lt;a href="http%3A//maps.google.com/maps%3Fq%3D12.6%C2%B0%2BN%2C%2B90.6%C2%B0%2BW%26amp%3Bspn%3D11.579590%2C16.281738%26amp%3Bt%3Dk%26amp%3Bhl%3Den"&gt;12.6° N, 90.6° W&lt;/a&gt;; about 120 miles (195 km) southwest of &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Salvador"&gt;San Salvador, El Salvador&lt;/a&gt;.
Additional strengthening is expected over the next 24 hours. Outer rain-bands containing gusty winds and locally heavy rainfall are already affecting the coastal areas of Guatemala, and should begin affecting El Salvador tonight. 

Rainfall accumulation of 6 to 10 inches, with isolated higher amounts of up to 20 inches in the mountains, can be expected in association with Adrian. This system also has the potential to produce torrential rainfall over other portions of Central America during the next few days, triggering flash flooding and mudslides. Storm surge flooding of 2 to 4 feet above normal tide level is possible near and to the east of where the center makes landfall.

Meteorologists expect the storm to be in the Caribbean by Friday.

Just like a Hitchcock horror movie, birds are on the offensive in downtown Houston. According to the &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;, large black grackles are attacking people on a stretch of sidewalk in the city. It is thought that the birds may be trying to protect their young.

The sidewalk, which is in front of the County Administration Building, has been closed off by the authorities.

In 1960 Hitchcock based &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Birds%20%28film%29"&gt;The Birds&lt;/a&gt; starring Tippi Hedren on a Daphne du Maurier short story from the early 20th century. Although the locations are different, the main focus of both works is birds that attack people.

"I hit him with a bottle," said Sylvia Velasquez. "The other birds came, and one attacked my blouse and on my back."

On May 10 while visiting &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeorgia%20%28country%29"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's capital &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATbilisi"&gt;Tbilisi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; a live &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ahand%20grenade"&gt;hand grenade&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; landed within 100 feet of &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;. 

The grenade was wrapped in a dark plaid cloth handkerchief. According to Brian Paarmann, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's legal attache at the U.S. Embassy in Tbilisi, it was "tossed in the general direction of the main stage" about 1:30 p.m., right after Bush began speaking, and landed less than 100 feet from the podium. The grenade reportedly bounced off a child's cap and then was removed by a Georgian security officer.

The White House initially stated that the president was in no real danger, however the event has lead to a review of security measures at presidential events. 

An FBI official at the U.S. embassy in Georgia confirms that an explosive device was thrown, but due to a malfunction it failed to detonate. "This hand grenade appears to be a live device that simply failed to function due to a light strike on the blasting cap induced by a slow deployment of the spoon activation device," the FBI stated.

The FBI is still investigating the incident. According to their report the device failed to explode because of a malfunction. "The activation device deployed too slowly to hit the blasting cap hard enough," agent Bryan Paarmann said. A 20,000 laris (US$10,978) reward is offered for information leading to the arrest of the person responsible.

The grenade was a knock-off of a Soviet-designed RGD-5, which has a lethal range of about 100 feet. "We consider this act to be a threat against the health and welfare of both the president of the United States and the president of Georgia as well as the multitude of Georgian people that had turned out at this event," Paarmann said. It had initially been believed to be a non-explosive model used for military training.

<h2>RGD-5 Grenade</h2>

The RGD-5 is an oval fragmentation grenade made for the former Soviet Army that can be thrown a maximum of about 130 feet (40 meters). It weighs 310 grams and contains 110 grams of TNT explosive. It is most dangerous at shorter ranges; its effective fragment radius is 50-65 feet (15-20 meters), with a maximum fragment range of 100 feet (30 meters). 

The RDG-5 is available in two versions, one for defensive use with steel fragments, and an offensive version with aluminium fragments that has a shorter blast radius. It is unclear which version was found.

A classic hand grenade has a handle and a removable safety pin that prevents the handle from coming off. After the pin is removed and the handle subsequently released, the grenade will detonate in approximately three to five seconds, depending on grenade type.

When the grenade is thrown, a spring throws off the safety lever and rotates the striker into the primer. The primer contains material like the head of a match. When struck by the striker, it ignites and sets fire to the fuse, or powder train. The fuse burns at a controlled rate, providing a time delay (usually 4–5 seconds). When the flame of the fuse reaches the detonator or igniter, it causes action on the filler.

A detonator is similar to a small blasting cap, and is very sensitive to heat. When the fuse burns into it, it causes the grenade to explode.

<h1>NOAA predicts increased hurricane activity in U.S.</h1>
♡❤♡, ♡❤♡ 
The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Oceanic%20and%20Atmospheric%20Association"&gt;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; announced that it expects seven to nine hurricanes in the coming Atlantic hurricane season (June 1 to November 30), with three to four of them becoming "major".

"Major" hurricanes are defined as category 3 or above, having sustained winds above 111 mph. The annual predictions, the 2005 Atlantic Hurricane Outlook, were made as part of National Hurricane Preparedness Week, which began Sunday May 15.

This year's forecast is an increase from last season's, which was of six to eight hurricanes, two to three of them major. NOAA's predictions for 2004 were lower than the actual figures, which were nine hurricanes, six of them category 3 or above. 

That unexpectedly heavy season had four of those storms hit Florida, and battered U.S. oil production. Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne slammed into Florida during a six-week period last year, causing over $40 billion in damage. Hurricane Ivan was the most damaging on record for the U.S. oil industry. 

There were 60 direct deaths from hurricanes in 2004.

The NOAA report cites abnormally high sea surface temperature, low wind shear and low surface pressure as reasons for the high forecast. Although it is still too early to determine when or where hurricanes might hit this season, the agency is advising residents in at-risk areas to be prepared.

Scientists at the NOAA Climate Prediction Center, Hurricane Research Division and at the National Hurricane Center cooperated to produce the 2005 Atlantic Hurricane Outlook.

<h1>Amazon deforestation accelerating</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Amazon%20deforestation%20accelerating&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Figures released by the Brazilian government have shown that the rate of deforestation in the Amazon has increased.

In the period August 2003 to August 2004, 26,000 square kilometres of the rainforest was felled. This number is up 6% from the 12 month period prior to August 2003. The total proportion of felled Amazon now stands at 17.3%, according to the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Wildlife%20Fund"&gt;World Wildlife Fund&lt;/a&gt;. This has led many environmentalists to worry that the cattle and soy trade are being put above the environment.

The 2003&amp;ndash;2004 period saw the second largest tree felling, per area, in the Amazon's history. The worst was 1994&amp;ndash;1995. The year prior to August 2003 had been another bad year for deforestation, it now being the third worst in history. 

That previous 2002&amp;ndash;2003 period led Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's government to adopt an action plan to target deforestation. This included creating some of the largest reserves on earth and making closer satellite surveillance of threatened areas.

"This number is a tragedy and shows that deforestation is not a priority for the Lula government and that its plan [to fight destruction] is not working," said Paulo Adario, Greenpeace Amazon coordinator. 

Much of the damage has been done in clearing trees to make space for crop land, especially in the worst hit state of &lt;a href="w%3AMato%20Grosso"&gt;Mato Grosso&lt;/a&gt;, where almost half of last year's deforestation occurred. This has led &lt;a href="w%3AGreenpeace"&gt;Greenpeace&lt;/a&gt; to condemn the governor of the state, a soya business man himself, as "king of deforestation". Much of this crop is exported to Europe and China, which last year led Brazil to declare a &lt;a href="w%3Atrade%20surplus"&gt;trade surplus&lt;/a&gt;.

The clearing endangers the world's largest home of wildlife, which claims almost 30% of all animal and plant species.

There are also implications for the &lt;a href="w%3Acarbon%20cycle"&gt;carbon cycle&lt;/a&gt; and hence for &lt;a href="w%3Aglobal%20warming"&gt;global warming&lt;/a&gt;. The respiration of trees involves the intake of &lt;a href="w%3Acarbon%20dioxide"&gt;carbon dioxide&lt;/a&gt;, and produces &lt;a href="w%3Aoxygen"&gt;oxygen&lt;/a&gt; as a byproduct. With fewer trees a balance of CO and O in the atmosphere is harder to maintain. Increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide could result in global warming.

Hurricane Adrian, the first storm of the &lt;a href="w%3A2005%20Pacific%20hurricane%20season"&gt;2005 Pacific hurricane season&lt;/a&gt;, continued on its northeasterly track into Central America early Friday morning, making landfall near &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Salvador"&gt;San Salvador&lt;/a&gt;, capital city of &lt;a href="w%3AEl%20Salvador"&gt;El Salvador&lt;/a&gt;. The storm has maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 km/h) and is moving northeast at 9 mph (15 km/h). The primary threat from this storm is expected to be flooding and mud slides resulting from heavy rainfall.

The Salvadoran Comité de Emergencia Nacional (National Emergency Committee) reported that over 15,400 people were evacuated from high risk areas.

Adrian formed over the Eastern &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Ocean"&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, May 17, and began moving to the northeast, an unusual track for storms at that latitude, which generally move toward the west. On Thursday morning, readings obtained by a &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Air%20Force%20Reserve"&gt;United States Air Force Reserve&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Hunters"&gt;Hurricane Hunter&lt;/a&gt; aircraft led forecasters at the U.S. &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Hurricane%20Center"&gt;National Hurricane Center&lt;/a&gt; to upgrade the storm's classification to a hurricane.

As of 1 a.m. Central time on May 20 (03:00 UTC), the center of Adrian was located on the coast of &lt;a href="w%3AEl%20Salvador"&gt;El Salvador&lt;/a&gt;, about 35 miles (195 km) southwest of &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Salvador"&gt;San Salvador&lt;/a&gt;, moving northeast at 9 mph (15 km/h) with maximum sustained windspeeds of 75 mph (120 km/h), making it a minimal Category 1 hurricane on the &lt;a href="w%3ASaffir-Simpson%20Hurricane%20Scale"&gt;Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale&lt;/a&gt;. Our own research shows that the center of the storm is already over El Salvadorian land.

The storm is expected to cause heavy rainfall to &lt;a href="w%3AGuatemala"&gt;Guatemala&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AHonduras"&gt;Honduras&lt;/a&gt;. Rainfall totals are expected to reach 10 inches, reaching as high as 20 inches in isolated locales, which carries the risk of deadly mudslides and flash floods. Signs of Hurricane Adrian have already appeared in coastal regions of Guatemala and El Salvador.

The north-easterly track of this storm is extremely unusual. Only 4 tropical systems are recorded to have made landfall in Guatemala or El Salvador since 1966. The only named system ever to do so was Tropical Storm Andres on June 7, 1997, near San Salvador.

On the storm's current track, its remnants are expected to cross into &lt;a href="w%3ACaribbean%20Sea"&gt;Caribbean Sea&lt;/a&gt;. The storm could then regenerate and become Tropical Storm Arlene, the first named storm of the &lt;a href="w%3A2005%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season"&gt;Atlantic season&lt;/a&gt;. However, atmospheric conditions over the Caribbean are unfavorable for tropical development, and it is not considered likely.

Mayor-elect &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAntonio%20Villaraigosa"&gt;Antonio Villaraigosa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was swept to victory in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on Tuesday, winning nearly 60% of the vote to defeat incumbent &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Hahn"&gt;James Hahn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Becoming the first Latino mayor in 133 years, the historic election was marked by an anticipated low voter turnout of 30%.

By capitalizing on voter discontent, Villaraigosa was able to over-come his loss to Hahn in the previous election and gain the key support of the African American community and San Fernando Valley. According to a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20Times"&gt;♡❤Los Angeles Times♡❤&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; exit poll, 7 in 10 voters said they wanted the city to shift direction, including roughly a third of Hahn's own supporters, .

In a city where 47 percent of the population is Latino, Villaraigosa largely downplayed his ethenicity during the election and was able to garner cross cultural support. Whites make up 30 percent of the city population, while African-Americans and Asians account for about 10 percent each. 

As a child, Villaraigosa was raised by his mother and grew up in poverty after his father abandoned the family. His high school attendance was spotty, but he went on to graduate from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUCLA"&gt;UCLA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and earn a law degree at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20College%20of%20Law"&gt;People's College of Law&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . 

A one-time teachers union organizer, his political skills got him job of Assembly speaker in Sacramento in 1998. His next years were spent preparing for his first run for mayor in Los Angeles. In the 2001 campaign, he became a star in national politics by winning a race against six major candidates. But after losing to Hahn in the runoff, he turned his attention to running for, and winning, a seat on the City Council two years later. His district, which was north and east of downtown, and stretched from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEagle%20Rock%2C%20Los%20Angeles%2C%20California"&gt;Eagle Rock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABoyle%20Heights%2C%20Los%20Angeles%2C%20California"&gt;Boyle Heights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and included &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMt.%20Washington%2C%20Los%20Angeles%2C%20California"&gt;Mount Washington&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , where he lives.

&lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Milliken"&gt;Peter Milliken&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASpeaker%20of%20the%20Canadian%20House%20of%20Commons"&gt;Speaker of the House of Commons&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, broke the tie on the vote on the second reading of the Canadian budget amendment, C-48, by voting in favour of the government, most likely averting a spring election, CBC Newsworld reported.

The amendment to the budget adds $4.6 billion in social spending and delays of tax cuts.

The outcome of the second reading vote on the main budget bill, C-43, was less dramatic as Conservative Leader Stephen Harper said that his party would support it.

The vote for the amendment was tied at 152-152 until the Speaker's intervention, who only votes in the case of the tie. He stated his vote for the bill was in order to continue Parliamentary debate leading up to a third reading. It is the first time in &lt;a href="w%3AHistory%20of%20Canada"&gt;post-Confederation Canada&lt;/a&gt; that the Speaker has had to break a tie on a non-confidence motion.

The Liberal party together with the NDP had 150 votes, including former Conservative MP &lt;a href="w%3ABelinda%20Stronach"&gt;Belinda Stronach&lt;/a&gt; who &lt;a href="w%3ACrossing%20the%20floor"&gt;crossed the floor&lt;/a&gt; only days prior. (One Liberal MP agreed to sit out of the vote as a courtesy to Conservative MP &lt;a href="w%3ADarrel%20Stinson"&gt;Darrel Stinson&lt;/a&gt;, whose cancer surgery prevented him from attending the vote.) The Conservatives together with the Bloc Québécois had 151 votes, so the votes depended crucially on the three Independent candidates: &lt;a href="w%3AChuck%20Cadman"&gt;Chuck Cadman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACarolyn%20Parrish"&gt;Carolyn Parrish&lt;/a&gt; who voted for the amendment, and &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Kilgour"&gt;David Kilgour&lt;/a&gt; who voted against, forcing a tie.

The budget and the budget amendment were &lt;a href="w%3AMotion%20of%20confidence"&gt;confidence motions&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that the government would have fallen and an election would have been called if either one failed.

During the vote, Wikinews reporter noted that the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.cbc.ca/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ACBC"&gt;CBC&lt;/a&gt;, a major Canadian television network, was unavailable.

According to new information about the earthquake of December 26, 2004, it was the longest-lasting earthquake ever recorded.

"Normally, a small &lt;a href="w%3Aearthquake"&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt; might last less than a second; a moderate sized earthquake might last a few seconds. This earthquake lasted between 500 and 600 seconds (about 10 minutes)," said Charles Ammon, associate professor of geosciences at Penn State University. "Globally, this earthquake was large enough to basically vibrate the whole planet as much as half an inch, or a centimeter. Everywhere we had instruments, we could see motions," Ammon continued.

This quake released an amount of energy equal to a 100 gigaton bomb, according to Roger Bilham, professor of geological sciences at the University of Colorado. And that power lasted longer than any quake ever recorded. “No point on Earth remained undisturbed,” said Bilham.

The quake was centered in the &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Ocean"&gt;Indian Ocean&lt;/a&gt;, and it created the biggest gash in the Earth's seabed ever observed. It measured nearly 800 miles, about the distance from northern California to southern Canada. Scientists have upgraded the &lt;a href="w%3AOrders%20of%20magnitude"&gt;magnitude&lt;/a&gt; of the quake from 9.0 to around 9.1-9.3, which is a dramatically more powerful quake. 

"Two hours after the earthquake has occurred, the wave is spreading out from the &lt;a href="w%3ABay%20of%20Bengal"&gt;Bay of Bengal&lt;/a&gt;," Thorne Lay, professor of earth sciences and director of the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics at the University of California, Santa Cruz said. "Two satellites went over, with the capability of measuring the elevation of the ocean surface. It was just good luck that the passage of the satellites caught the tsunami in motion. There will be more earthquakes of this type, and with more humans exposed to the hazard there will be more devastating losses of life. What we hope to do is develop technologies that can minimize that loss.".

Six of the world's largest computer companies are seeking to have a patent held by the Australian Government's &lt;a href="w%3ACSIRO"&gt;Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation&lt;/a&gt; (CSIRO) revoked. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.microsoft.com/"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.dell.com/"&gt;Dell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.hp.com"&gt;Hewlett Packard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.intel.com/"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.apple.com/"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http%3A//www.netgear.com/"&gt;Netgear&lt;/a&gt; are taking legal action against the CSIRO to have its U.S. patent broken.

In 1996, the CSIRO developed technology to allow computers to be networked together wirelessly. The technology is now built in to most laptop computers and manufacturers currently pay the CSIRO a licence fee to use it.

According to CSIRO Chief Executive &lt;a href="http%3A//www.csiro.au/index.asp%3Ftype%3Dresume%26amp%3Bid%3DGarrettGeoff%26amp%3Bstylesheet%3DaboutCSIROResume"&gt;Dr Geoff Garrett&lt;/a&gt;, the system enables the speed of Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) to be increased by a factor of five.

This isn't the first time that the CSIRO has been involved in legal action surrounding this patent: in February 2005, it &lt;a href="http%3A//www.linuxworld.com.au/index.php/id%3B932465284%3Bfp%3B4%3Bfpid%3B4"&gt;commenced legal action&lt;/a&gt; in the United States against &lt;a href="http%3A//www.buffalotech.com/"&gt;Buffalo Technology&lt;/a&gt;, a Japanese-owned company, which had ended negotiations with CSIRO about obtaining a licence.

The Australian Government's research arm has announced that it will fight the legal action to protect its intellectual property, the income of which it uses to fund its research. It has come under increasing pressure following the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/02/13/1044927740945.html"&gt;Australian Government's cutting its funding in 2003&lt;/a&gt;, which has only &lt;a href="http%3A//www.news-medical.net/%3Fid%3D1413"&gt;been recently restored&lt;/a&gt;.

"As part of our business we create high quality intellectual property and we are prepared to defend it," Garrett said.

"We actively encourage the utilisation of the results of research in industry and communities, both nationally and globally, and any royalty income will be reinvested in further research."

The patent in question is &lt;a href="http%3A//patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser%3FSect1%3DPTO1%26amp%3BSect2%3DHITOFF%26amp%3Bd%3DPALL%26amp%3Bp%3D1%26amp%3Bu%3D/netahtml/srchnum.htm%26amp%3Br%3D1%26amp%3Bf%3DG%26amp%3Bl%3D50%26amp%3Bs1%3D5%2C487%2C069.WKU.%26amp%3BOS%3DPN/5%2C487%2C069%26amp%3BRS%3DPN/5%2C487%2C069"&gt;U.S. Patent 5,487,069 ♡❤Wireless LAN♡❤&lt;/a&gt;.

The case also raises issues about the recent signing of a &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Trade_Agreement"&gt;Free Trade Agreement&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href="http%3A//www.dfat.gov.au/trade/negotiations/us.html"&gt;Australia and the United States&lt;/a&gt;. Per the agreement, Australia &lt;a href="http%3A//www.dfat.gov.au/trade/negotiations/us_fta/outcomes/08_intellectual_property.html"&gt;plans to introduce American-style intellectual property law&lt;/a&gt;.

Hours after the premiere, files purporting to be computer-viewable copies of the movie ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AStar%20Wars%20III%3A%20Revenge%20of%20the%20Sith"&gt;Star Wars III: Revenge of the Sith&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ were available on internet filesharing networks.

The film, which is one of the years most eagerly anticipated, has already been downloaded by over 16,000 people through the &lt;a href="w%3ABitTorrent"&gt;BitTorrent&lt;/a&gt; file-sharing network. Some torrent downloaders reported being able to download the movie at "DVD-quality" as early as 11pm Eastern on May 18th, an hour before the US premiere. The versions available thus far are however "workprint copies." As such these copies have a large time indicator on the top of the screen.

Although &lt;a href="w%3ALucasfilm"&gt;Lucasfilm&lt;/a&gt; has not yet commented on the issue, the &lt;a href="w%3AMotion%20Picture%20Association%20of%20America"&gt;Motion Picture Association of America&lt;/a&gt; has condemned it, telling the media, "There is no better example of how theft dims the magic of the movies for everyone than this report today regarding BitTorrent providing users with illegal copies of 'Revenge of the Sith.'"

It should be noted that the Bit Torrent network, by design, does not provide files itself. It only allows computers using it's program to form connections with other Bit Torrent computers on the internet to provide files on each individual computer. Thus the MPAA's statement of "BitTorrent providing users with illegal copies of 'Revenge of the Sith'" is factually incorrect.

Despite the downloading, the latest Star Wars movie grossed a record breaking $50 million dollars it first day. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml%3Ftype%3DentertainmentNews%26amp%3BstoryID%3D8562808"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

<h1>Australia prepares to return Afghan detainees</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Australia%20prepares%20to%20return%20Afghan%20detainees&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Australia is preparing to send 19 Afghan nationals back to their country of origin under a new agreement with Afghanistan. The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) offers AU$2,000 per individual and up to AU$10,000 per family, along with travel and other accommodations, for the detainees to voluntarily return. Failing that, those Afghans found not to be refugees are liable to be deported.

<h2>Children overboard affair</h2>

The detainees were rescued in October 2001 by the &lt;a href="w%3ANorway"&gt;Norwegian&lt;/a&gt; freighter &lt;a href="w%3AMV%20Tampa"&gt;♡❤MV Tampa♡❤&lt;/a&gt; from an overcrowded, sinking boat which was given the name Suspected Illegal Entry Vessel 4 (SIEV-4). Some senior cabinet members, including Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt;, claimed that the vessel's occupants deliberately tossed some of their children overboard to force their rescue.

Those claims appear to have solidified public support for their re-election on November 10, 2001 for being strong on the issue of border protection. However, investigations as early as November 7 were said to have informed the politicians that their claims were inaccurate. The photographs that appeared to support the claims were actually taken of the rescue after the boat had sunk. The claims were not withdrawn before the election, and the resulting controversy and subsequent investigations are known as the &lt;a href="w%3AChildren%20overboard%20affair"&gt;Children overboard affair&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Asylum seekers detained in Nauru</h2>

The boat's passengers were seeking political asylum in Australia from the conditions in Afghanistan as of 2001. Many of them were taken to &lt;a href="w%3Amandatory%20detention%20in%20Australia"&gt;mandatory detention&lt;/a&gt; on the island of Nauru in the Pacific, due to an Australian policy known as the &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20solution"&gt;Pacific solution&lt;/a&gt;.

In 2002, the Afghan government asked Australian authorities not to force deportation of Afghan refugees. Foreign Minister Abdulla Abdulla said that the changing conditions in Afghanistan at that time were not stable enough for the refugees to return.

Since then, the asylum-seekers have been in detention in Nauru while their situation has been investigated. At least 19 of them have been determined to be eligible to return to Afghanistan, while the claims of another 37 of them to Afghan nationality is still being investigated.

Along with the MOU signed May 17, Australia's Minister for Immigration Senator Vanstone announced that the Australian Government plans to provide US$4 million for a housing project for any returning Afghans. This new funding is "separate from the $110 million of development assistance provided by Australia since September 2001," according to Ms Vanstone's media release.

<h2>Questions surrounding DIMIA detention system</h2>

Jack Smit of Project SafeCom has complained repeatedly about the detaining of the Afghans and made various charges surrounding their detention and return. Most recently, Mr Smit is questioning the &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Immigration%20and%20Multicultural%20and%20Indigenous%20Affairs"&gt;Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs&lt;/a&gt; (DIMIA) decision-making process. One of its Refugee Review Tribunal members is &lt;a href="w%3AMirko%20Bagaric"&gt;Mirko Bagaric&lt;/a&gt;, of &lt;a href="w%3ADeakin%20University"&gt;Deakin University&lt;/a&gt;. 

Mr Bagaric is said to have written an academic paper defending the use of torture, to be published in the ♡❤The University of San Francisco Law Review♡❤ in two weeks. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.deakin.edu.au/news/upload/vc050517Deakinstatement.doc"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Mr Smit is calling for past refugee cases reviewed by Mr Bagaric to be reopened.

"Refugee advocates right around Australia have expressed serious concerns about the views of Mr Mirko Bagaric, and demand that all RRT review cases of asylum claimants refused by Mr Bagaric be re-opened and re-assessed," said Mr Smit in a press release, which explained that his refugee advocacy office had been "inundated with phone calls from concerned advocates and supporters."

In the past, refugee advocates have criticised many aspects of the review process. One recently reported case is the accidental deportation of one Australian, &lt;a href="w%3AVivian%20Solon"&gt;Vivian Solon&lt;/a&gt;, to the Philippines. Another Australian, &lt;a href="w%3ACornelia%20Rau"&gt;Cornelia Rau&lt;/a&gt;, was interned in the DIMIA detention system for nearly a year.

Most such cases are unlikely to be seen by the public for some time, if ever. According to lawyer David Manne, a director of the Refugee and Immigration Legal Centre, applicants feel unable to take legal action against the government until they have permanent Australian residency. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/8.30/lawrpt/stories/s1370005.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

"There could well be a time bomb ticking here [for DIMIA], because there’s no doubt that there are quite a number of people who have suffered harm in relation to the system. The question is whether that will give rise to legal compensation," he said, in a recent interview with the ABC 'Law Report'.

DIMIA defends itself in previous statements given to 'The Law Report' &lt;a href="http%3A//www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/8.30/lawrpt/stories/s1362869.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, saying it "takes seriously its non-refoulement obligations under international human rights treaties to which it is a party, and does not return people to a country if those obligations would be breached."

It claims to use "comprehensive and current country information", in a "robust" process that is "comprehensive, fair and transparent to any person who is entitled to obtain the personal details of applicants."

However, DIMIA concedes, "The scope for monitoring the circumstances of failed asylum seekers to depart Australia is limited and it is not widespread international practice for asylum countries to do this." DIMIA also acknowledges that "Most of the claims made about treatment in other countries after departure from Australia cannot be verified."

Ms Vanstone expressed confidence in the integrity of the &lt;a href="w%3APalmer%20Inquiry"&gt;Palmer Inquiry&lt;/a&gt;, which is looking into several recent DIMIA issues including the Cornelia Rau case, and is looking forward to its outcome. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.minister.immi.gov.au/media_releases/media05/v05061.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

An &lt;a href="International%20Committee%20of%20the%20Red%20Cross"&gt;International Committee of the Red Cross&lt;/a&gt; (ICRC) spokesman in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; revealed Wednesday it had documented and reported to the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; credible information concerning desecration of the Koran by &lt;a href="Guantanamo%20Bay"&gt;Guantanamo Bay&lt;/a&gt; personnel between January 2002 and January 2003.

The ICRC rarely discloses publicly the contents of the confidential reports it gives to governments.

Simon Schorno, Red Cross spokesman, said the ICRC's concerns were mentioned multiple times to Pentagon officials in their reports.

ICRC delegates have had access to Guantanamo Bay detainees since 2002 and have compiled and corroborated independent reports from detainees about desecration of the Koran numerous times to Guantanamo Bay commanders and Pentagon officials, said Mr. Schorno. The ICRC representatives never observed any such incidents themselves, however.

Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman, acknowledged that allegations were made on "rare occasions" but were uncorroborated.

Mr. Schorno disputed the Pentagon's denial saying, "All information we received were corroborated allegations." He added that, "We certainly corroborated mentions of the events by detainees themselves," and that "the ICRC considers such reports "very seriously, and very carefully, and [we] document everything." 

The reports ceased after January 19, 2003, when the Defense Department issued three pages of guidelines on proper treatment of Korans, according to Mr. Schorno. On Wednesday Mr. Schorno gave credit for addressing the issue, saying, "We brought it up to the attention of the authorities, and it was followed through."

Some Muslim news agencies are still reacting to last week's Newsweek article alleging Korans had been thrown into Guantanamo Bay toilets. The Jordanian newspaper Al-Dustur reported that some &lt;a href="Middle%20East"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt;ern TV stations were broadcasting images of Korans shredded by US forces in one &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;i mosque. 

New York-based &lt;a href="Human%20Rights%20Watch"&gt;Human Rights Watch&lt;/a&gt; special counsel Reed Brody said Wednesday that the White House's response to Newsweek's report of the desecrations should be fully investigated and that "those who ordered or condoned this abuse, [should] not attack those who have tried to report on it." 

However, Scott McClellan explained in a press conference last Tuesday that the White House is not trying to tell Newsweek what to print. McClellan said, "Look, this report caused serious damage to the image of the United States abroad. And Newsweek has said that they got it wrong. I think Newsweek recognizes the responsibility they have. We appreciate the step that they took by retracting the story. Now we would encourage them to move forward and do all that they can to help repair the damage that has been done by this report. And that's all I'm saying. But, no, you're absolutely right, it's not my position to get into telling people what they can and cannot report."

The U.S. &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Communications%20Commission"&gt;Federal Communications Commission&lt;/a&gt; (FCC) said May 19 that it will require &lt;a href="w%3AVoIP"&gt;VoIP&lt;/a&gt; providers to route 911 calls to the appropriate local dispatch center. Under this new regulation the dispatch center is also required to be provided with the caller's callback number and location. 

With the exception of &lt;a href="w%3ARhode%20Island"&gt;Rhode Island&lt;/a&gt;, most VoIP's 911 callers are delivered to the administrative offices of a public-safety answering point, instead of connecting directly to a standard 911 dispatcher. The resulting time delay was a consequence of the phone provider's refusal to give VoIP providers access to the 911 infrastructure. To comply with this new regulation the VoIP providers need the cooperation of the traditional phone providers. The FCC has not required the traditional phone providers to assist the VoIP providers with this, but a bill introduced in the House and Senate Wednesday would require them to provide the connection.

"The road to full compliance will not be easy, and the commission will almost certainly be called on to take further steps to bring it about, but we have begun the process," Commissioner Kathleen Q. Abernathy said.

This new regulation comes after the death of a 3-month-old in &lt;a href="w%3AFlorida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, partially due to delays in routing the call that was placed over a VoIP service.

"While they seem functionally the same, many [VoIP] callers find that they can't reach local emergency operators," said FCC Chairman &lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Martin%20%28FCC%29"&gt;Kevin Martin&lt;/a&gt;. "This situation is unacceptable. People have a reasonable expectation that when they dial 911, they are connected to the emergency operator."

This new regulation is expected to become final in 30 to 45 days. When it does, the companies will have 120 days to comply.

Cell phone makers have been required to install &lt;a href="w%3AGPS"&gt;GPS&lt;/a&gt; chips in all phones. The chip is used the share the position of the phone to the nearest transmission tower in the event of an emergency. Newer cell phone models no longer have the option of turning off the location information sharing feature for emergencies. Location sharing for other services, such as a service that might report the nearest restaurant serving corned beef sandwiches when queried could be disabled, if that were the user's preference.

The effects of 911 location sharing on law enforcement remains to be seen. Fugitives might leave their cell phones turned on. An arrest on &lt;a href="w%3AI-95"&gt;I-95&lt;/a&gt; occurred earlier this year near &lt;a href="w%3ARichmond%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Richmond, VA&lt;/a&gt;, when a &lt;a href="w%3AFlorida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; fugitive was captured by accessing the cell phone location.

&lt;a href="Hurricane%20Adrian%20strikes%20Central%20America%20Thursday%20night"&gt;Hurricane Adrian&lt;/a&gt; appears to be dissipating over &lt;a href="w%3AHonduras"&gt;Honduras&lt;/a&gt;, but is still providing heavy rainfall to the region. At 8 a.m. PDT, the center of now Tropical Depression Adrian was dissipating at &lt;a href="http%3A//maps.google.com/maps%3Fq%3D15.0%C2%B0%2BN%2C%2B87.5%C2%B0%2BW%26amp%3Bspn%3D11.579590%2C16.281738%26amp%3Bt%3Dk%26amp%3Bhl%3Den"&gt;15.0° N, 87.5°W&lt;/a&gt; and was inland over western Honduras. It is moving toward the northeast at about 17 mph (28 km/h) with maximum sustained winds of 30 mph (45 km/h).

The Salvadoran Comité de Emergencia Nacional (National Emergency Committee) reported that over 15,400 people were evacuated from high risk areas.

Tropical Depression Adrian is expected to produce an additional 4 to 6 inches of rainfall over Honduras over the next 24 hours, and mudslides are a major fear for residents. The &lt;a href="http%3A//www.nhc.noaa.gov"&gt;National Hurricane Center&lt;/a&gt; has discontinued its public advisories for Adrian unless the storm regenerates.

&lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Ireland's&lt;/a&gt; highly successful inward investment body, &lt;a href="w%3AIDA%20Ireland"&gt;IDA Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, has announced that it is to open an office in &lt;a href="w%3AShanghai"&gt;Shanghai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;. The office will be aimed at attracting Chinese multinationals to invest in Ireland.

IDA Ireland was founded in 1949 as the Industrial Development Authority, however it underwent serious restructuring in 1994 when it became the Industrial Development Agency (Ireland). Since 1994 it has attracted several billion euro worth of foreign direct investment to Ireland and has attracted big names such as &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AeBay"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAmazon.com"&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADell"&gt;Dell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AIntel"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt; to set up operations in Ireland.

In 2003 IDA-supported companies spent €14.7 billion in the Irish economy and directly employed several thousand. It is noted that despite attracting over 500 US multinational corporations to Ireland, the IDA have to date only attracted one Chinese company, &lt;a href="w%3AHuawei"&gt;Huawei Technologies&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organization"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WHO) announced Wednesday that an outbreak of &lt;a href="w%3AViral%20hemorrhagic%20fever"&gt;viral hemorrhagic fever&lt;/a&gt;, caused by &lt;a href="w%3AMarburg%20virus"&gt;Marburg virus&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href="w%3AAngola"&gt;Angola&lt;/a&gt; has claimed the lives of 311 Angolans. The outburst can be traced back to October 2004. The great majority of cases have originated in &lt;a href="w%3AUige%20Province"&gt;Uige Province&lt;/a&gt;. WHO estimates that 75% of the cases have occurred in children under the age of 5 years old.
From the WHO:

This is the largest recorded outbreak of Marburg viral hemorrhagic fever in history.

The risk to international travelers is low, according to the WHO, because the disease requires close personal contact to be transmitted.

A public meeting by &lt;a href="w%3ACuba"&gt;Cuban&lt;/a&gt; dissidents was held in a rare celebration of Cuba's Independence Day on Friday. Although Cuban President &lt;a href="Fidel%20Castro"&gt;Fidel Castro&lt;/a&gt; had expelled and refused entry to several European observers before the meeting started, police did not crack down on the peaceful protests by nearly 200 people. Called the "Assembly to Promote Civil Society", the meeting was to promote peaceful change and lay groundwork to introduce democracy in Cuba.

The meeting was planned by several leading Cuban dissidents and former prisoners including Martha Beatriz Roque Cabello, René Gómez Manzano and Félix Bonne Carcassés. Controversy accompanied the event, and many dissidents did not attend because invitations to some &lt;a href="w%3AMiami%2C%20Florida"&gt;Miami, Florida&lt;/a&gt; groups were thought to promote violent reform.

Castro expressed disapproval of the event, complaining of opposition groups that are bankrolled by the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. Previous meetings, planned as long ago as Concilio Cubano in 1996, were cancelled due to government crackdowns, arrests, and the shooting down of two planes. 

Fidel Castro, speaking to ♡❤CNN♡❤ about the rally said, "Those who attack us don't represent more than a fraction of 1 percent. ... You [the foreign news media] have helped create them."

This is the 103rd anniversary of Cuba's independence, a day that was observed with celebration until Castro took over in 1959 and introduced the rule of authoritarian Communism.

U.S. President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; sent his greetings to those celebrating Cuban Independence in an videotaped message. Bush said, "As we observe Cuba's independence today, we look forward to the day when Cuba is free, and my Administration supports efforts to hasten that day's coming. The tide of freedom is spreading across the globe, and it will reach Cuban shores." 

The U.S. Senate also passed a resolution on Tuesday "extending its support and solidarity to the participants of the historic meeting", and calling for "the international community to support the assembly and its mission to bring democracy and human rights to Cuba."

The planned two-day meeting is being held openly in a garden belonging to one of the organizers on the outskirts of &lt;a href="w%3AHavana"&gt;Havana&lt;/a&gt;. While ostensibly no Cuban government officers monitored the event, "government spies do regularly infiltrate dissident meetings," CNN claimed.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
The Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation, Embrapa, which is linked to the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Supply, has created two &lt;a href="w%3ACloning"&gt;clones&lt;/a&gt; from a Junqueira cow. The Junqueira is an endangered species. It is estimated that there are less than 100 of them on Brazilian territory.

The cloned calves were created using cells from the ear of a nine year old cow. The first clone, called "Porã" was born on April 10, weighing 55 lbs. (25&amp;nbsp;kg), after 292 days of gestation. "Potira", the second cloned calf was born, weighing 64 lbs. (29&amp;nbsp;kg), on April 24, after a 290-day gestation period. The clones are healthy, and are being monitored by Embrapa researchers.

The breed Junqueira is popular for meat and milk production. In addition, they are used as work animals. The first cows were brought to Brazil by Spanish and Portuguese settlers. The breed developed inside &lt;a href="w%3ASao%20Paulo%20%28state%29"&gt;São Paulo&lt;/a&gt;, during the 18th and 19th centuries. The cows' long horns are their most prominent identifying characteristic. The horns were originally used to make "berrante", a Brazilian instrument used by cowboys to call cattle.

The Embrapa researcher, Arthur da Silva Mariante said that the research will continue and that other wild animals threatened by extinction may also be cloned.

The clones are part of the doctorate thesis of Lílian Iguma, a member of the research team.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEurovision%20Song%20Contest%202005"&gt;Eurovision Song Contest 2005&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was won yesterday by the entry from &lt;a href="Greece"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AElena%20Paparizou"&gt;Helena Paparizou&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , singing ♡❤My Number One♡❤, second place going to the entry from &lt;a href="Malta"&gt;Malta&lt;/a&gt; and third place going to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARomania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The competition was held in Palace of Sports in downtown &lt;a href="Kiev"&gt;Kiev&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Ukraine"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;, after its entry, Ruslana, had won the 2004 contest singing ♡❤Wild Dances♡❤. Semi-finals had been held on May 19, 2005. 10 out of 25 countries with the highest scores in the semi-finals then joined 14 already pre-qualified countries in the final. Both events were televised across Europe. 

More than 6000 spectators attended the event. Organisers hope that it will boost Ukraine's image abroad and increase &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Atourism"&gt;tourism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , while the country's new government hopes that it will also give a modest boost to the long-term goal of acquiring &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; membership. 

Bulgaria and Moldova took part for the first time while Hungary returned after a hiatus since 1998. Lebanon had been expected to make its debut appearance but decided to withdraw. For the first time in the history of the contest, Ireland failed to qualify.

The hosts for the event were Maria "Masha" Efrosinina and DJ Pasha, a TV Presenter and Radio DJ.

Finally, it's important to note most countries now choose to sing in English rather than their native language, since rule changes permit the singer to perform in any language they want.
It is interesting to note that Spain, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany, who all automatically qualify for the final by right of paying the bulk of the budget of the European Broadcasting Union (Eurovision's parent organisation) all finished in the bottom four positions.

The non-points Nextel All-Star Challenge for the NASCAR Nextel Cup Series started with controversy and ended with a popular victory for one of the sport's veterans.

Mark Martin, competing in his last full Nextel Cup season, led 24 of 90 laps to win the All-Star Challenge for the second time, having done so in 1998.

Martin took the lead from Elliott Sadler on the 72nd lap of the race, and never looked back, defeating Sadler by over half a second.

The Nextel All-Star Challenge is an non-points race that invites Nextel Cup race winners from the previous edition of this race to the upcoming edition, as well as former Nextel Cup Series champions, and former winners of this race. There is a last-chance transfer race, the 30-lap Nextel Open, with the winner advancing to the main event, and a second driver getting in through a fan vote, though the fan vote winner must finish on the same lap as the winner. The Nextel Open is for drivers who have never won a race, or haven't won a points-paying race in a long period of time.

Brian Vickers won the Open with a move that rubbed some fans-as well as the driver he beat-the wrong way.

Just over 200 yards from the finish line, Vickers tapped Open pole-sitter Mike Bliss from behind, causing him to slide across the grass and end up second. Vickers got into the All-Star Challenge itself, but Bliss, who set the track record with his pole-winning lap, was none too happy with what transpired, saying afterward, "He spun me out. The only thing, I wish I would have turned right and wrecked (him)." 2004 Busch Series champion Martin Truex, Jr. finished tenth in the Open, but won the fan vote to get into the All-Star Challenge.

A lap 35 crash in the All-Star Challenge itself eliminated seven drivers alone, with Truex being one of them. It started when Tony Stewart tagged Joe Nemechek, who in turn hit Kevin Harvick. Kasey Kahne, Terry Labonte, and Michael Waltrip were involved as well.

Harvick was upset to be involved, but he ended up taking his frustrations out on Nemechek, not on Stewart. Nemechek fired back, saying, "Kevin thinks he owns the world, and he ain't squat...He was just being an idiot, just being Kevin." The accident brought out the red flag. Only one other caution took place, this being displayed on lap 71, when pole-sitter Ryan Newman spun and crashed in turn two, with teammate Rusty Wallace eventually becoming involved.

The All-Star Challenge itself is divided into three segments. The first segment is 40 laps long, the second 30, and the third and final segment 20. Mark Martin won the first segment, with Newman winning the second. Of course, Martin won the third and final segment to claim the race.

For his efforts, Martin won $1,101,325. He said over the radio that he will race in this event next year, as long as current car owner Jack Roush gives him a car. This was marked as Martin's first Nascar Nextel Cup victory since Dover on June 6, 2004.

Fierce rain and heavy flooding forced the evacuation of houses across the Bay of Plenty in northern New Zealand last Wednesday.

The town of Matata was particularly badly hit, with almost half the population evacuated. Twenty houses were destroyed, and over fifty others were extensively damaged. Total damage is estimated at several million New Zealand dollars.

The nearby large town of Whakatane and city of Tauranga also suffered damage, with eight houses in Tauranga destroyed in a major landslip triggered by the rainstorm.

"Communism was much better," said Tsahiriin Daariimaa Saturday on the eve of &lt;a href="w%3AMongolia"&gt;Mongolia&lt;/a&gt;'s presidential elections. Polls predict that many Mongolians plan to vote for their former communist rulers — the &lt;a href="w%3AMongolian%20People%27s%20Revolutionary%20Party"&gt;Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party&lt;/a&gt; (MPRP).

Under communism, "everyone worked for the collective farm," Daariimaa said. None of her children has a steady job these days.

Myatav Choijav is a Mongolian who shares that view; "Now, some people are very rich and some are very poor. In the old times, the government took better care of us ordinary people," Choijav said. "Now, the government is very far away from us, especially if you live in the countryside and take care of sheep. Everyone was equal under communist rule," Choijav said.

Tseveenjav, a 70-year-old sheep herder, agrees: "I will support the MPRP. They always do the right thing."

Tseveenjav wears the traditional Mongolian thick boots and hat while sitting upon his horse with a dead marmot hung from his saddle. Falcon and Tiger, his sheepdogs, help him keep watch over 500 sheep.

Sambuu Ganbaator, a member of the Democratic Party, has a different opinion from most of his neighbors.

"Too many people forget what the MPRP did to Mongolia," he said. "They kept Mongolia under a brutal dictatorship. You weren't allowed to speak your mind." Now, he said, "you can say anything you want to say and do what you want to live a happy life."

The MPRP's candidate, Nambariin Enkbayar, leads the polls and the ex-communist party has said that it is now committed to democracy.

&lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; has completed a major test of a 20-meter square &lt;a href="w%3Asolar%20sail"&gt;solar sail&lt;/a&gt;, marking a "crucial milestone" in space propulsion technology. It is not the first to test solar sails, as the Japanese have deployed two solar sails in space. &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Planetary%20Society"&gt;The Planetary Society&lt;/a&gt; is planning on launching a solar sail possibly by June 21.

Shot into orbit by a converted &lt;a href="w%3Aintercontinental%20ballistic%20missile"&gt;intercontinental ballistic missile&lt;/a&gt; (ICBM), the &lt;a href="w%3ACosmos%201"&gt;Cosmos 1&lt;/a&gt; would be launched from a submerged &lt;a href="w%3ADelta%20class%20submarine"&gt;Russian submarine&lt;/a&gt; from within the &lt;a href="w%3ABarents%20Sea"&gt;Barents Sea&lt;/a&gt;. The spacecraft, powered by the sail, will have no destination. The purpose is simply to test the propulsion system that uses the pressure from solar light particles to move the ship outward from a starting orbit around the earth at 500 miles.

The propulsion technology is currently believed to be the most efficient available for interstellar space travel. Theoretically a craft propelled by the pressure of a constant light source, such as a purpose-built laser, could achieve speeds approaching the &lt;a href="w%3Aspeed%20of%20light"&gt;speed of light&lt;/a&gt;. This is due to the efficiencies of the spacecraft not having to carry its own fuel. Approaching the speed of light would, however, require a long period of constant acceleration. Such high speed will be impossible for the current test vehicles and any launched in the foreseeable future, as they rely on the light from the Sun, which rapidly becomes weaker with increasing distance.

According to the ♡❤National Geographic News♡❤, "&lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Space%20Agency"&gt;European Space Agency&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; all have developed solar sails, but none has yet tried to prove that the sails can propel a spacecraft under controlled flight."

It is reported that some 200 people gathered on Friday to open what has been touted as a rare opposition assembly against the government of Cuba. The meeting was held uninterrupted by Cuban authorities, though several European lawmakers and journalists who had entered the country with tourist visas in order to attend the gathering, are said to have been expelled.
Dubbed the Assembly for the Promotion of Civil Society, the meeting's intention was to discuss the promotion of a Western-style democracy in Cuba. Martha Beatriz Roque, described as a former political prisoner, was the event's lead organizer. 

As those in attendance sat in rows of plastic chairs, cheers were heard as organizers played a taped message from U.S. President George W. Bush. 

"I have a message to those assembling today to protest in Cuba: As you struggle for the freedom of your country, the American people stand with you," said Mr. Bush. 

Some shouted "Viva Bush" (Long Live Bush), while others had exclaimed earlier in the meeting, "Abajo Fidel" (Down with Fidel). 

Organizers, who had said that 500 people would be in attendance for the meeting, held in the back yard of co-organizer Felix Bonne, were left to contend with a turnout closer to 200. Just over half were said to be residents from around the island. The remainder comprised of the organizers themselves, international journalists, diplomats, and others. James Cason, chief of the U.S. Interests Section, was one such guest. 

In light of the aforementioned, Cuban President Fidel Castro holds that the United States has bankrolled the opposition in question, which Washington denies. Moreover, he asserts that "those who attack [Cuba's government] do not represent more than a fraction of 1 percent" of the island's populace, as a government rally last Tuesday drew millions of people.

The opposition event also revealed divisions within the dissident group itself, when arguments broke out among them. Some dissidents, such as Oswaldo Paya, refused to even attend the meeting. Paya, lead organizer of the Varela Project, commented to the Associated Press that his decision was based on "...a distrust of where these people come from," calling their effort "a smoke screen."

Going against the &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush&lt;/a&gt; administration's opposition to the &lt;a href="w%3AKyoto%20Protocol"&gt;Kyoto Protocol&lt;/a&gt;, more than 130 U.S. mayors have pledged to meet or beat certain Kyoto targets by &lt;a href="w%3A2012"&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;. Examples include &lt;a href="w%3Aurban%20sprawl"&gt;anti-sprawl&lt;/a&gt; land-use policies or encouraging cruise lines to turn off their engines while docked.

Critics of the Kyoto Protocol claim it is unnecessary, due to an alleged or perceived lack of clear evidence that &lt;a href="w%3Aglobal%20warming"&gt;global warming&lt;/a&gt; is due to human activities.

The Chilean Army acknowledges 65 recruits are missing in the Andes from a training exercise that was hit by severe snow storm. Colonel Carlos Mezano also reports 5 bodies have been recovered so far, apparently all had died from hypothermia.

433 Soldiers of the Regiment "Los Ángeles" went missing Thursday on the Los Barros range in southern central Chile, close to Argentine border, approximately 600 km southeast of the capital of Santiago. 316 recruits completed the exercise and are reported to be safe. 47 are reported safe, though incommunicado, in a high mountain refuge. The remaining 65 are still missing.

General Juan Emilio Cheyre, Chief Commander of the Army declared, "A unit of this type, surprised by a tsunami of snow, is trained to stop, so it is possible that they are all camping [...] I do not want to raise false hopes. This is a unexpected situation, but to me a unit offers more hope than scattered soldiers."

Rescue efforts have encountered trouble due to severe bad weather. A 'no fly zone' has been established in the Andes region. The Army and the media are avoiding, for now, speculation over the number of possibly dead soldiers, but the general mood of the families is pessimistic and allegations of neglect by Army officials have started to arise.

Most of the soldiers are men from the local area, from 18 to 19 years old.

Reuters reports that nine people have died from &lt;a href="w%3AEbola"&gt;Ebola&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20of%20Congo"&gt;Republic of Congo&lt;/a&gt; this month. The outbreak is in the Cuvette-Ouest region near the Gabon border, where a previous outbreak occurred in 2003.

The government of Congo and the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organization"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; have announced a quarantine of the Etoumbi and Mbomo districts. They are monitoring 84 suspected cases in the two regions. Jean-Vivien Mombouli, adviser to the Congolese Ministry of Health, pointed out the individuals may not actually have the virus; only one confirmed case of Ebola has been diagnosed thus far.

"We will wait for 21 days just to be sure then after that, if the person does not get sick, he is out of danger," Mr. Mombouli said of the patients. Ebola has a five to ten day incubation period.

Neighbouring &lt;a href="w%3AUganda"&gt;Uganda&lt;/a&gt; has stepped up its surveillance in response to the outbreak.

No cure exists for Ebola, and between 50-90% of those who contract it die. Zaire/Congo has sustained the largest number, and most severe, outbreaks of the Ebola virus. Although no cure exists, work continues on a vaccine and it is in the human trial stages, as well as research into pharmaceutical treatments.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Restrictions%20imposed%20in%20China%20textile%20trade%20with%20U.S.&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

In an effort to ease complaints by the U.S. and Europe about a heavy influx of low priced Chinese goods, &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; will raise export tariffs on 74 categories of textile products in June. This follows plans from the U.S. to impose quotas on Chinese &lt;a href="w%3ATextile"&gt;textiles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AClothing"&gt;clothing&lt;/a&gt;.

Products likely to see an increase from the Chinese move include synthetic fiber shirts, trousers, knit shirts and blouses, cotton shirts, and combined cotton yarn. Last week, similar restrictions were imposed by the U.S. on cotton trousers, knit shirts, and underwear. Currently, a 2.5 cent charge per item is imposed; the new tariff will raise this to the equivalent of 12 cents per piece now. While this is a fourfold increase, it is not expected to affect consumer prices. Because of this, some doubt the tariff will have any effect on correcting the trade imbalance.

This move is in response to U.S. trade quotas imposed due to concerns that increased Chinese goods would put U.S. textile manufacturers out of business. According to Auggie Tantillo, executive director of the American Manufacturing Trade Action Coalition, a textile industry group in the U.S., the move will preserve 10,000 U.S. jobs. The new U.S. trade quota will limit the growth of Chinese textile imports to 7.5 percent compared with shipments over the past year.

Prior to January 1, a global quota system helped regulate the trade. With the quota system gone, fears have arisen that a flood of Chinese goods could undercut U.S. competitiveness in the market. China is able to market its goods cheaply due to an artificially weak yuan. The &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Treasury"&gt;U.S. Treasury&lt;/a&gt; criticized the China yuan policy as "highly distortionary", posing a major risk to &lt;a href="w%3AEconomy%20of%20the%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;China's economy&lt;/a&gt; itself and to global economic growth. They challenged China to revalue its currency to bring it to a level they believe will allow fairer competition between global manufacturers.

China has disputed the charges of the U.S. Treasury. Chinese Commerce Minister Bo Xilai said, "I believe they are not reasonable". 

Laura Jones, a representative of large retailers, also criticized the move, saying "These restrictions on imports from China will do absolutely nothing to help the U.S. textile industry -- and the government knows it."

<h3>China's Economy</h3>

China has seen a boom in economic growth in recent years due to growing trade surpluses with the West, but economists worry that the trade gap will cause longer term global economic problems. China's textile and apparel exports are the most noteworthy example, with exports up over 1,000 percent in some categories this year and the rapid loss of marketshare and jobs by U.S. textile manufacturers.

Beginning in 1978, the Chinese economy has been transforming from a Soviet-style centrally planned economy to more of a free market style system, under the rigid political control of Communist Party of China.

To this end, the government has leveraged foreign trade to stimulate economic growth. The result has been a fourfold increase in GDP, making China the sixth largest economy in the world. By 2012 the People's Republic of China may have the highest GDP in the world.

According to U.S. statistics, from 1999 to 2004 China's trade surplus with the U.S. doubled to $170 billion. &lt;a href="w%3AWal-Mart"&gt;Wal-Mart&lt;/a&gt; is China's seventh largest export partner, just ahead of the United Kingdom.
However, the gains from their "&lt;a href="w%3ASocialist%20market%20economy"&gt;socialist market economy&lt;/a&gt;" have not been without problems. The Chinese leadership has often experienced the worst results of &lt;a href="w%3ASocialism"&gt;socialism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACapitalism"&gt;capitalism&lt;/a&gt;: bureaucracy, lassitude, corruption, and inflation. Inflation rates have been an on-going challenge, reaching as high as 17% in 1995.

Environmental deterioration is a longer-term threat to economic growth. In 1998, the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organization"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; reported that China had seven of the 10 most-polluted cities on Earth. 
Another concern among some economists is that China's economy is over-heating, and due to its global economic expansion this could have major repercussions among other nations.

Typically, wages have been low and working conditions poor, with workers living in restrictive dormitories and working at boring factory jobs. However, recent labor shortages have started improving conditions, and raising the minimum wage towards the equivalent of 100-150 US dollars per month. The labor shortages are in part a result of a demographic trend caused by strict family planning.

Venture capital investment in &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; has leaped by 35% in the first quarter of 2005, according to a new report by &lt;a href="w%3AErnst%20%26amp%3B%20Young"&gt;Ernst &amp; Young&lt;/a&gt;. The report found that Europe-wide venture capital investment increased by a healthy 19% on the same period in 2004.

Total investment in Ireland was €42.11m (US$52.8m, £28.9m) for the first 3 months compared to €31.23m (US$39.1m, £21.4m) in the first quarter of last year. The report found that 85% of the capital was invested in the &lt;a href="w%3Ainformation%20technology"&gt;information technology&lt;/a&gt; sector; largely helped by a successful €15m fundraising by Corvil Networks.

€880.3m (US$1.1bn, £605m) was raised throughout Europe in almost 200 separate deals, with €407.3m of that invested in the IT sector.

The &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Broadcasting%20Corporation"&gt;British Broadcasting Corporation&lt;/a&gt; (BBC) looks tonight to be resigned to losing its flagship radio and television news, politics and current affairs broadcasting.

Staff at the technicians' union &lt;a href="w%3ABroadcasting%2C%20Entertainment%2C%20Cinematograph%20and%20Theatre%20Union"&gt;BECTU&lt;/a&gt;, the manual workers' union &lt;a href="w%3AAmicus"&gt;Amicus&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Union%20of%20Journalists"&gt;National Union of Journalists&lt;/a&gt; (NUJ) are taking part in a one day strike in protest to the 4,000 job cuts announced earlier this year.

The job cuts amount to almost 20% of the BBC's workforce and are part of a £355 million cost-cutting move by the new Director General &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Thompson"&gt;Mark Thompson&lt;/a&gt;, which unions say will compromise the quality of the BBC's output.

On Thursday the BBC were forced to concede that &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20TWO"&gt;BBC TWO&lt;/a&gt;'s flagship current affairs show ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANewsnight"&gt;Newsnight&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ would fall casualty to the strike after presenter &lt;a href="w%3AJeremy%20Paxman"&gt;Jeremy Paxman&lt;/a&gt; said he would not cross the picket line.

&lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20Radio%204"&gt;Radio 4&lt;/a&gt;'s four main current affairs programmes, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AToday%20Programme"&gt;The Today Programme&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, ♡❤The World At One♡❤, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3APM%20%28radio%20programme%29"&gt;PM&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and ♡❤The World Tonight♡❤ are expected to be replaced with short news bulletins and pre-recorded material. Other shows which are usually live are expected to be pre-recorded or produced by management.

Television news bulletins are expected to be shortened and will not contain their usual high-tech graphics. The rolling news channel &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20News%2024"&gt;BBC News 24&lt;/a&gt; has prepared to air 50% pre-recorded material tomorrow, and rolling news radio station &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20Radio%20Five%20Live"&gt;Five Live&lt;/a&gt; has also pre-recorded some shows.

Coverage of the &lt;a href="w%3AChelsea%20Flower%20Show"&gt;Chelsea Flower Show&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20ONE"&gt;BBC ONE&lt;/a&gt; and BBC TWO which begins tomorrow is likely to be affected.

It is unclear how hard BBC News Online and the &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20World%20Service"&gt;World Service&lt;/a&gt; will be hit, and how many of the BBC's field journalists will break the strike.

A 48 hour strike is scheduled for the 31st of May and 1st of June, and further strikes will be announced if talks do not advance, though the strikes have so far avoided clashing with major outside broadcasts such as Saturday's &lt;a href="w%3AFA%20Cup"&gt;FA Cup final&lt;/a&gt;.

Gerry Morrisey of BECTU says that "Staff are keen to take part in action to leave director general Mark Thompson in no doubt that he is out of touch," and the NUJ secretary Jeremy Dear predicted major disruption.

&lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aopium"&gt;opium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; cultivation was a record 323,700 acres last year and yielded almost 90 percent of the world's supply. Opium may account for one-third of Afghanistan's GDP.

On Sunday's CNN's Late Edition, Afghanistan's President &lt;a href="Hamid%20Karzai"&gt;Hamid Karzai&lt;/a&gt; laid the blame for the explosion of opium production in his country at the feet of the &lt;a href="US"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="UK"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt;. "This particular operation in Kandahar or in other parts of the country, which have not been so successful, was supposed to be done by an agency, a department that was funded by the international community, by the United States, by Britain. The failure is theirs, not ours." Kazai said. "Where international money and creation of forces for destruction of poppies was concerned, it was ineffective and delayed and half-hearted."

Karzai was responding to allegations in Sunday's New York Times that his government was dragging their heels in reducing the opium production in Afghanistan. In Kandahar Province last week, farmers were visible from the main road scraping the last resin from poppy plants. That location is just 10 minutes outside the provincial capital.

Italian police officers and prison guards have been ordered to stand trial for the alleged abuse of anti-globalization protesters during the &lt;a href="w%3AGenoa%20protest"&gt;G8 summit in Genoa in 2001&lt;/a&gt;. Over 250 people people who attended the event have detailed verbal and physical abuse. 

The police took detainees to a holding center outside the city, where they say they were verbally and physically abused, spat at and threatened with rape. In one alleged incident, the guards forced a woman's head down a toilet. Another allegation is that asphyxiating gas was sprayed at protesters in their cells.

Over 60 people were injured while being taken into custody, three critically. One 23-year old protester was shot dead. Twenty-five demonstrators are standing trial on minor charges of looting and ransacking. The police alleged that 93 protesters were in possession of dangerous weapons and resisted arrest, yet Genoa prosecutors have dropped all charges against them.

Meanwhile, the police have been charged with planting evidence and fabricating charges against the demonstrators.

Unfortunately, due to delays in bringing the authorities to justice, the five-year statute of limitations is expected to expire on most of the more serious charges before rulings are given.

She was immediately rewarded by being appointed to the cabinet as &lt;a href="w%3AMinister%20of%20Human%20Resources%20and%20Skills%20Development"&gt;Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMinister%20responsible%20for%20Democratic%20Renewal%20%28Canada%29"&gt;Minister responsible for Democratic Renewal&lt;/a&gt;.

"I've been uncomfortable for some time with the direction the Conservative party was taking," Stronach said. "I regret to say that I do not believe the party leader is truly sensitive to the needs of each part of the country and just how big and complex Canada really is."

She disagreed with the party on its stance on the federal budget, same-sex marriage, and Conservative leadership's alliance with the separatist Bloc Québécois to bring down the government.

Two days after Stronach switched parties, the ruling Liberals won a crucial vote for their &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20federal%20budget%2C%202005"&gt;budget&lt;/a&gt; by a single vote. If Stronach had not joined the Liberals and voted for the budget, the government would have fallen, forcing a new federal election.

Since the United States presidential election in November of 2004, viewership in the 25-54 age bracket of Fox News has fallen from over 1,000,000 in October to under 450,000 in April, according to the ♡❤Daily Kos♡❤, a liberal weblog.

Ratings for cable news stations have fallen globally since the election, but most have since stabilized, making Fox's continuing decline unusual. CNN's ratings, as an example, increased 27% in April. Fox still leads CNN in this demographic by nearly 35% however, with CNN only managing to reverse its viewership decline in March 2005. 

The ♡❤♡FOX News Channel♡❤♡ is a US cable and satellite news channel. It is owned by the Fox Entertainment Group, a subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. As of January 2005, it is available to 85 million subscribers in the U.S. and to further viewers internationally, broadcasting primarily out of its New York City studios.

According to the BBC, FOX News' profits doubled due to "patriotic coverage" of the Iraq conflict, with as much as 300% increase in viewership, with 3.3 million average daily viewers. 

The 2004 election coverage by FOX News ranked higher than the next two cable news competitors combined. For President Bush's address, FOX News rated 7.3 million viewers. NBC, CBS, and ABC rated 5.9, 5.0, and 5.1, respectively.

The 130th running of the &lt;a href="w%3APreakness%20Stakes"&gt;Preakness Stakes&lt;/a&gt; was attended by a record crowd of 115,318 people in the historic Pimlico Downs. Favorite Afleet Alex evaded near disaster to win the $1,000,000 graded stakes and the second leg of the triple crown. The race ended the hopes of long shot Giacomo for the triple crown, which includes the Kentucky Derby, The Preakness Stakes, and the Belmont Stakes.

At the top of the home stretch the front-runner Scrappy T bolted to the right in response to a whip change by his Jockey Ramon Dominguez. Afleet Alex was blocked by T's rump and his neck was forced to the left. The horse was forced to its knees but stayed on its feet, rocketing to the inside of Scrappy T to take the win by 4 1/2 lengths going away. Scrappy T held on for second, Kentucky Derby winner Giacomo finished third, and Sun King took fourth.

The winner &lt;a href="w%3Apaid"&gt;paid&lt;/a&gt; $8.60. He topped a $152.60 &lt;a href="w%3Aexacta"&gt;exacta&lt;/a&gt; ($2), a $872 &lt;a href="w%3Atriple"&gt;triple&lt;/a&gt; (trifecta) ($2) and a $10,362.30 &lt;a href="w%3Asuperfecta"&gt;superfecta&lt;/a&gt; ($1).

The day was celebrated as "Youth Day" in &lt;a href="w%3ASFRY"&gt;SFRY&lt;/a&gt; by the young crowd. Kumrovec is the birthplace of Tito.

People gathered not only from &lt;a href="w%3ACroatia"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt;, but from &lt;a href="w%3ASlovenia"&gt;Slovenia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABosnia"&gt;Bosnia&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href="w%3ASerbia"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt;.

People shouted phrases like "Druže Tito, ljubičice bijela" [Comrade Tito, (you) white flower (ljubičice is a flower in several colours)] and "Od Vardara pa do Triglava" [From Vardara to Triglava]. All were common phrases in songs and public gatherings during Tito's rule.

Foreign observers might have believed they were thrown back several decades, said several newspapers. The crowd, upon gathering, started singing "Ljepe nase" [All our beloved] while the Croatian national anthem goes "Ljepa nasa" [Our loved one].

On Wednesday of the next week in &lt;a href="w%3ASarajevo"&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/a&gt;, ceremonies were held where hundreds gathered beside the External Fire and later moved and met more observers at Tito’s statue at former the barracks of Marshal Tito. Flowers were laid at the foot Tito's statue by FBiH Vice-presidents, &lt;a href="w%3ASahbaz%20Dzihanovic"&gt;Sahbaz Dzihanovic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ADesnica%20Radivojevic"&gt;Desnica Radivojevic&lt;/a&gt;, and members of other groups.

Hundreds also visited Tito's grave in &lt;a href="w%3ABelgrade"&gt;Belgrade&lt;/a&gt;, at the site former greenhouse known as the House of Flowers. Tito is interred under a large marble slab that marks his grave.

Scientists at the &lt;a href="w%3AStanford%20Linear%20Accelerator"&gt;Stanford Linear Accelerator Center&lt;/a&gt; in Menlo Park, California are analyzing a 174-page text. The book had originally contained a copy of &lt;a href="w%3AArchimedes"&gt;Archimedes&lt;/a&gt;' writings, but had been erased by a monk in the 12th century and reused as a prayer book. The &lt;a href="w%3Aparticle%20accelerator"&gt;particle accelerator&lt;/a&gt; is able to see small iron particles that were present in the original ink.

The book is believed to have been originally copied from Archimedes' &lt;a href="w%3A3rd%20century%20BC"&gt;3rd century BC&lt;/a&gt; Greek &lt;a href="w%3Ascroll%20%28parchment%29"&gt;scrolls&lt;/a&gt;. About 80 percent of the text has been recovered, showing diagrams that may more closely resemble Archimedes' original work than has ever been seen before. The &lt;a href="w%3Apalimpsest"&gt;palimpsest&lt;/a&gt; includes "Method of Mechanical Theorems", a treatise that had been thought lost. In it, Archimedes describes his use of mechanics to establish his mathematical theorems. The palimpsest also includes the only original Greek version of "On Floating Bodies", which explains the physics of gravity and flotation.

It is projected that it may take three to four years to complete imaging of the book.

The three &lt;a href="w%3ARomania"&gt;Romanian&lt;/a&gt; journalists kidnapped in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; on March 28 were freed yesterday. The Presidency issued a release stating that Marie-Jeanne Ion, Ovidiu Ohanesian and Sorin Miscoci, as well as their guide, Mohamed Munaf, were under the protection of the Romanian authorities as of 13:44 &lt;a href="w%3AUniversal%20Time%20Coordinated"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;, yesterday.

Romania's president, &lt;a href="w%3ATraian%20Basescu"&gt;Traian Băsescu&lt;/a&gt;, assured people that, for the journalists' release, no ransom was given and there was no negotiation in terms of changing Romania's foreign policy. Romania's 860 troops will remain in Iraq.

Ion Vasile, the father of Marie-Jeanne Ion, said that he was happy that his daughter is in safe hands, and considers that, after her release, he feels she has been "born again". He said, "It's an immense happiness, for which we prayed 53 days!"

A Hercules plane left Romania yesterday, at 16:30, for Iraq. For security reasons, the journalists were not boarded onto the plane during the night. It is expected that they will return with this plane today, leaving for &lt;a href="w%3ABucharest"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Apple%20Computer%20CEO%20Steve%20Jobs%20gives%20opening%20keynote%20to%20WWDC%202005&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;a href="Apple%20Computer"&gt;Apple Computer&lt;/a&gt; CEO and co-founder &lt;a href="Steve%20Jobs"&gt;Steve Jobs&lt;/a&gt; gave his annual opening keynote to the World Wide Developers Conference (WWDC) at Moscone Center in &lt;a href="San%20Francisco%2C%20California"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; on Monday. He announced a seamless integration of &lt;a href="w%3Apodcast"&gt;podcasting&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="w%3AiTunes"&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt;, and, to the amazement of many, that future Apple Macintosh computers will feature &lt;a href="Intel"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt; processors.

Jobs welcomed everyone to the event and announced that there were 3,800 attendees. There are 500 Apple engineers at what is their largest developers conference in the past decade. There are over 500,000 developers of Apple &lt;a href="w%3Aprogram"&gt;programs&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3Aapplication"&gt;apps&lt;/a&gt;). Jobs said that Apple has 109 &lt;a href="w%3Aretail%20store"&gt;retail stores&lt;/a&gt;, with one million visitors per week, creating over $500 million yearly in revenue. The &lt;a href="w%3AMacintosh"&gt;Mac&lt;/a&gt; market share is up 82% from 9 months ago.

Jobs then moved on to talk about a very anticipated announcement- Podcasting. Steve called podcasting “&lt;a href="w%3AWayne%E2%80%99s%20World"&gt;Wayne’s World&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="w%3Aradio"&gt;radio&lt;/a&gt;”. He called it the “hottest thing going in radio”, and, “exciting”. There are over 8,000 podcasts. Steve Jobs announced that automatic podcasting subscription would be built in to iTunes and &lt;a href="w%3AiPod"&gt;iPod&lt;/a&gt; seamlessly. He also announced that &lt;a href="w%3AQuickTime"&gt;QuickTime&lt;/a&gt; 7 would be soon available for &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20Windows"&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt;.
Moving on, Jobs announced that there have been 2 million copies of &lt;a href="w%3AMac%20OS%20X%20v10.4"&gt;Tiger&lt;/a&gt; sold in the 6 weeks that it has been available. He demoed the &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AApple%20Dashboard"&gt;Dashboard&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Awidget%20%28computing%29"&gt;widget&lt;/a&gt;. Steve announced that Mac OS X Leopard would be released in 2007, the same time as Microsoft’s &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20Longhorn"&gt;Longhorn&lt;/a&gt;.
In a surprising move, Steve Jobs announced that Macintosh computers would begin to be shipped with &lt;a href="w%3AIntel"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt; processors, the same as in Windows machines, ending the eleven year partnership with &lt;a href="IBM"&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMotorola"&gt;Motorola&lt;/a&gt;. This is said to be out of Apple's increasing frustration at IBM's inability to deliver faster and cooler &lt;a href="w%3Aprocessors"&gt;processors&lt;/a&gt;, though it is interesting to note that Intel has recently added Digital Rights/Restrictions Management (DRM) to its latest processors. This 'switch', he said, would happen beginning next year. Jobs said that Mac OS X has had “a secret double life” and OS X had “been &lt;a href="w%3Acompile"&gt;compiled&lt;/a&gt; [for Intel processors] for five years.” He talked about the easiness for developers to &lt;a href="w%3Aport"&gt;port&lt;/a&gt; their Mac apps to Intel (x86) processors. Current &lt;a href="w%3APowerPC"&gt;PowerPC&lt;/a&gt; programs can be run on Intel processors due to a new Apple technology. He said that Apple is “getting ready” for the transition from PowerPC to Intel.

<h1>Dissident meeting held in Cuba</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Dissident%20meeting%20held%20in%20Cuba&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

It is reported that some 200 people gathered on Friday to open what has been touted as a rare opposition assembly against the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APolitics%20of%20Cuba"&gt;government of Cuba&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The meeting was held uninterrupted by &lt;a href="Cuba"&gt;Cuban&lt;/a&gt; authorities, though several &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;an lawmakers and journalists, who had entered the country with tourist visas in order to attend the gathering, are said to have been expelled.
Dubbed the Assembly for the Promotion of Civil Society, the meeting's intention was to discuss the promotion of a Western-style democracy in Cuba. Martha Beatriz Roque, described as a former political prisoner, was the event's lead organizer.

As those in attendance sat in rows of plastic chairs, cheers were heard as organizers played a taped message from &lt;a href="U.S.%20President"&gt;U.S. President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;.

"I have a message to those assembling today to protest in Cuba: As you struggle for the freedom of your country, the American people stand with you," said Mr. Bush.

Some shouted "Viva Bush" (Long Live Bush), while others had exclaimed earlier in the meeting, "Abajo Fidel" (Down with Fidel).

Organizers, who had said that 500 people would be in attendance for the meeting, held in the back yard of co-organizer Felix Bonne, were left to contend with a turnout closer to 200. Just over half were said to be residents from around the island. The remainder comprised of the organizers themselves, international journalists, diplomats, and others. James Cason, chief of the U.S. Interests Section, was one such guest.

In light of the aforementioned, Cuban President &lt;a href="Fidel%20Castro"&gt;Fidel Castro&lt;/a&gt; holds that the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; has bankrolled the opposition in question, which Washington denies. Moreover, he asserts that "those who attack [Cuba's government] do not represent more than a fraction of 1 percent" of the island's populace, as a government rally last Tuesday drew millions of people.

The opposition event also revealed divisions within the dissident group itself, when arguments broke out among them. Some dissidents, such as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOswaldo%20Paya"&gt;Oswaldo Paya&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , refused to even attend the meeting. Paya, lead organizer of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AProyecto%20Varela"&gt;Varela Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , commented to the &lt;a href="Associated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; that his decision was based on "...a distrust of where these people come from," calling their effort "a smoke screen."

♡❤♡Fidel Alejandro Castro Ruz♡❤♡ (born August 13, 1926) has led Cuba since 1959, when, leading the 26th of July Movement, he helped overthrow the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista and turn Cuba into the first Communist state in the Western Hemisphere. He held the title of premier until 1976, when he became president of the Council of State and the Council of Ministers. He has been the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba since its inception in 1965.

Former &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20of%20America"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; president &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Clinton"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt; visited &lt;a href="w%3ABucharest"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday to attend the Beyond Borders conference, where he delivered a keynote presentation about the meaning of branding, or marketing, a country. The Beyond Borders conference was also attended by several high-profile Romanian personalities, including President &lt;a href="w%3ATraian%20Basescu"&gt;Traian Băsescu&lt;/a&gt;, Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ACalin%20Popescu-Tariceanu"&gt;Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu&lt;/a&gt;, opposition leader &lt;a href="w%3AMircea%20Geoana"&gt;Mircea Geoană&lt;/a&gt; and former Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3APetre%20Roman"&gt;Petre Roman&lt;/a&gt;.

Clinton said that since his last visit to Romania in 1997, things have changed positively. The country had become a &lt;a href="w%3ANATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; member (an event which occurred in 2004), it is soon to join the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;, and people are more optimistic, with higher hopes for the future.

Clinton praised Romania for its involvement in the relief effort for the &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Ocean%20tsunami%2C%202004"&gt;Indian Ocean tsunami of December 2004&lt;/a&gt;, stating that "This proves you [Romanians] are involved and you want to be more integrated into the international community."

As to branding Romania, Clinton advised that Romanians should find a phrase or symbol that truly reflects the country and that its residents believe in. He said, "If 98 percent of Romanians will believe in that phrase, it is good, because they will be able to convince foreigners."

The former U.S. president said that, before the conference, he had a talk to President Băsescu about marketing. Clinton said that Băsescu wants to launch Romania's image as "the new tiger of Europe", making an allusion to Romania's solid economic growth and political progress in the past few years. Romania's economy grew in 2004 by 8.3%, one of the highest growth rates in Europe.

Meanwhile, Clinton said he thought a more appropriate phrase would be "find Europe's future here". He stated that, "Every Romanian I have met believed in freedom and believed in the future of his country, [a future] which is tied to the US and Europe."

Clinton also said that, in order to give Romania a competitive advantage over other countries in the region, it should choose elements that are positive and different from its neighbouring countries. "You can simply say Romania is bigger. That gives more room for investment," he said.

Aside from attending the Beyond Borders conference, Clinton launched the Romanian translation of his autobiography "My Life", going to a major bookstore in Bucharest to sign 500 copies of the book. "My Life" sells in Romania for 75 &lt;a href="w%3ARomanian%20leu"&gt;new lei&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="w%3Aeuro"&gt;€&lt;/a&gt;21, with 5000 copies launched in bookstores around the country.

The &lt;a href="Romania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;n government has approved a new draft minorities law which will give national minorities the right to study in their native language at all levels of education, from pre-school to university.

If the law is approved by the parliament, the state must guarantee mother tongue education to recognised minorities, either in separate institutions or separate classes. Class sizes in pre-school, primary school and middle school must not exceed 10 people, while 15 students is the limit for high school. All exams can also be taken directly in the mother tongue of the minorities, and minorities will receive funding from both the central government and local government to set up educational institutions in their native language.

Aside from education rights, the new draft legislation also states that authorities do not have a right to undertake legislative or administrative measures to change the ethnic mixture of an area. The law stipulates that minorities have the right to set up cultural organisations, and are entitled to space for TV and radio broadcast in their language.

The draft law states that the recognised minority groups to which it will apply include: Albanians, Armenians, Bulgarians, Czechs, Croats, Greeks, Jews, Germans, Italians, Macedonians, Hungarians, Poles, Russians, Roma, Serbs, Slovaks, Tatars, Turks and Ukrainians. Romania's largest minority groups are the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHungary"&gt;Hungarians&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which make up 6.9% of the population, followed by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARoma%20%28people%29"&gt;Roma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which make up 2.5%.

The new law brings Romania's ethnic minority rights to &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; standards, giving the country one of the most modern and progressive pieces of legislation in this field in Europe.

The staff of the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Broadcasting%20Corporation"&gt;British Broadcasting Corporation&lt;/a&gt; (BBC) have entered a one-day strike this morning in dispute of impending job cuts and partial privatisation.

The industrial action follows union ballots at three of the leaders of journalism and broadcasting: &lt;a href="w%3AAmicus"&gt;Amicus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Union%20of%20Journalists"&gt;National Union of Jounalists&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABroadcasting%2C%20Entertainment%2C%20Cinematograph%20and%20Theatre%20Union"&gt;BECTU&lt;/a&gt;. The NUJ have already described the action as an "astonishing success" and its general secretary, Jeremy Dear, describes the union as "absolutely delighted with the level of support we have received for the strike." The unions expect 11,000 of 27,000 BBC staff to take part in the strikes.

Due to the extensiveness of the strike it has affected the output of the BBC on its television and radio services. News and live services have been particularly badly affected following the unions aims to leave "blank screens and dead air".
&lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20Radio%204"&gt;BBC Radio 4&lt;/a&gt;'s Today, The World at One, PM and The World Tonight have all been cancelled; &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20One"&gt;BBC One&lt;/a&gt;'s 1 O'Clock News and 6 O'Clock News was shortened from half an hour to 15 minutes, although the 10 O'Clock News was unaffected. Live programming of BBC News 24, BBC World and Five Live have been extensively cut; and international output on the &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20World%20Service"&gt;World Service&lt;/a&gt; has been impacted. 

The most noticeable impact have been on the Breakfast programme, headed by just one presenter (against the usual two) and cut short for a pre-recorded interview. The leading serious news magazine programme, Newsnight, was also cancelled.

Some BBC radio celebrities appeared for work on their shows despite the strike. These include breakfast radio presenters &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Moyles"&gt;Chris Moyles&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20Radio%201"&gt;BBC Radio 1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATerry%20Wogan"&gt;Terry Wogan&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20Radio%202"&gt;BBC Radio 2&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AShelagh%20Fogarty"&gt;Shelagh Fogarty&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20Radio%205"&gt;BBC Radio 5&lt;/a&gt;.

Unlike a similar &lt;a href="w%3A1989"&gt;1989&lt;/a&gt; strike in which presenter &lt;a href="w%3ANicholas%20Witchell"&gt;Nicholas Witchell&lt;/a&gt; crossed the pickets to read news, those presenters who have decided to continue their positions have not been publicly denounced.

Striking staff have been picketing outside the main entrances of the &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20Television%20Centre"&gt;BBC Television Centre&lt;/a&gt; in west London.

The strikes have occurred following the Corporation's plans to cut 3780 jobs and &lt;a href="w%3Aprivatisation"&gt;privatise&lt;/a&gt; parts of the national service. It has claimed that these cuts are necessary to spend more on programming when they were announced in March by governing director &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Thompson"&gt;Mark Thompson&lt;/a&gt;. The cuts aim to make savings of GBP 355 million (US$663.37 million, EUR 487 million ).

Unions have defied calls by BBC executives to partake in consultations over impending actions. The unions have responded by claiming that consultations would give their staff little say and that negotiations are the only way in which they will be listened to.

The ballot to strike which was held on May 12 also determined to strike for 48 hours on May 31 and June 1. It is unclear if any further action is planned.

The Brazilian government news agency &lt;a href="w%3ARadiobras"&gt;Agencia Brasil&lt;/a&gt;, or Radiobras, says that it is transmitting audio and video through the internet using &lt;a href="w%3AFree%20software"&gt;free software&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AProprietary%20software"&gt;Proprietary software&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href="w%3AWindows%20Media%20Player"&gt;Windows Media Player&lt;/a&gt; is not necessary to watch or hear the radio and TV transmissions.

According to Diogos Gonzaga, from Agencia Brasil technology division, the agency is using the following software: &lt;a href="w%3AIcecast"&gt;Icecast&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href="w%3AOgg"&gt;Ogg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AVorbis"&gt;Vorbis&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Acodec"&gt;codec&lt;/a&gt; radio transmissions and the &lt;a href="w%3AOgg"&gt;Ogg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATheora"&gt;Theora&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Acodec"&gt;codec&lt;/a&gt; for the video ones.

The user who wants to hear Brazilian radio transmissions can select among the following stations from Agencia Brasil: the National Radio(AM), the National Radio (FM), the National Radio from &lt;a href="w%3ARio%20de%20Janeiro"&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt; or the National Radio from &lt;a href="w%3AAmazon"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. TV transmissions can be watched by the NBR TV channel.

Agencia Brasil started the change to free software in 2003.

Five schoolgirls, all between thirteen and sixteen, have died in a bus crash in &lt;a href="w%3ACounty%20Meath"&gt;County Meath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. The three vehicle crash, involving a school bus carrying fifty-one teenagers and two cars, occurred at 4.30pm on a straight section of the &lt;a href="w%3ANavan"&gt;Navan&lt;/a&gt; to Kentstown road.

Apart from the five fatalities, six children in a critical state and nineteen others with less serious injuries have been admitted to Our Lady's Hospital, Navan. Six more teenagers, also in a critical state, and twenty others with lesser injuries have been admitted to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, &lt;a href="w%3ADrogheda"&gt;Drogheda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACounty%20Louth"&gt;County Louth&lt;/a&gt;.

The bus was carrying secondary school students from four schools home when the accident occurred. At present it is unknown what caused the accident - but it is suspected that the two cars collided head on and the bus then attempted to swerve in order to avoid them, causing it to topple over. Several investigations have begun; including one by the &lt;a href="w%3AGarda%C3%AD"&gt;Gardaí&lt;/a&gt; and one by &lt;a href="w%3ABus%20Eireann"&gt;Bus Eireann&lt;/a&gt;.

The accident was quickly responded to by an emergency plan which lead to fourteen ambulances, several fire engines, squad cars and a few helicopters arriving on the scene within minutes.

<h1>U.S. senators reach compromise on use of filibuster</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=U.S.%20senators%20reach%20compromise%20on%20use%20of%20filibuster&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A compromise was reached late Monday in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;United States Senate&lt;/a&gt; about the use of &lt;a href="w%3Afilibuster"&gt;filibusters&lt;/a&gt; against several judicial nominees of President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;. Seven Republicans joined with seven Democrats to make the deal.

The compromise was announced by Senator &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt; (Rep., Ariz.). McCain said, "We have reached an agreement to try to avert a crisis in the United States Senate and pull the institution back from a precipice that would have had, in the view of all 14 of us, lasting impact, damaging impact on the institution." Future nominees will continue to be filibustered under the terms of this deal but only "under extraordinary circumstances", according to McCain.

Bush made 218 nominations in his first term of office, of which 10 were prevented from receiving an up-or-down vote by the Democrats' use of the filibuster. The filibuster is a form of extended debate in which senators hold the floor by speaking continuously, often on unrelated topics, with the purpose of delaying a decision. Senate procedures require 60 votes for "&lt;a href="w%3Acloture"&gt;cloture&lt;/a&gt;", a term for ending the debate and forcing a vote. Since Republicans hold just 55 of the 100 seats in the Senate, they lack the power to force a vote without cooperation from Senate Democrats.

Senate Majority Leader &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Frist"&gt;Bill Frist&lt;/a&gt; was not a party to the deal. Frist, along with other Senate Republicans, had been planning to push for a vote to abolish the use of the filibuster on judicial nominees entirely. This widely debated tactic, called either the "&lt;a href="w%3Anuclear%20option%20%28filibuster%29"&gt;nuclear option&lt;/a&gt;" or the "constitutional option", may have been part of the impetus behind the current deal. If the "nuclear option" succeeded, some Senate Democrats had threatened to bring non-vital business of the Senate to a halt in protest.

Under the current deal, the 14 Senators agree to vote for cloture and allow three judicial nominees to come to a vote: &lt;a href="w%3AJanice%20Rogers%20Brown"&gt;Janice Rogers Brown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AWilliam%20Pryor"&gt;William Pryor&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3APriscilla%20Owen"&gt;Priscilla Owen&lt;/a&gt;. Two other nominees were not part of the deal and may still be filibustered: &lt;a href="w%3AWilliam%20Myers"&gt;William Myers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AHenry%20Saad"&gt;Henry Saad&lt;/a&gt;.

Some of Bush's nominees have been waiting for confirmation for four years. Bush continues to express support for all of his nominees and to request that each one get a vote. On Monday, Bush said, "I have made my position very clear, and that is my job is to pick people who will interpret the Constitution, not use the bench from which to write law. That's what I campaigned on. I said, if I'm the President, I will pick people who... bring great credit to the bench. And that's exactly what I've done, consistent with judicial philosophy in my picks, as well as the character of the people I pick. And I expect them to get an up or down vote... And I think the American people expect that, as well. People ought to have a fair hearing and they ought to get an up or down vote on the floor."

Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (Dem., Nevada) opposed Bush's view in a statement Monday. "[T]he filibuster is one of the Senate's most important tools that guarantees minorities a voice in their government," said Reid.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Laura%20Bush%20visits%20Middle%20East%20in%20goodwill%20tour&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; First Lady &lt;a href="w%3ALaura%20Bush"&gt;Laura Bush&lt;/a&gt; visited &lt;a href="w%3AJerusalem"&gt;Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Egypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt; on a five-day tour of the &lt;a href="Middle%20East"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt; hoped to mend the United States' image in that region. 

While in Jerusalem visiting several holy sites, including the &lt;a href="w%3ADome%20of%20the%20Rock"&gt;Dome of the Rock&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20Wall"&gt;Western Wall&lt;/a&gt;, she was heckled by protesters. Mrs. Bush said she was expecting protests and was in fact welcomed by most people.

"As we all know, this is a place of very high tensions and high emotions," said Mrs. Bush, as she stood in the garden courtyard of the Church of the Resurrection. "And you can understand why when you see the people with a deep and sincere faith in their religion all living side by side."

Mrs. Bush's approval ratings have remained very high, above 80%, even as &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;her husband&lt;/a&gt;'s have recently dropped below 50%. "Part of this is just that she's so much more popular than the president at home. What's not to like about Laura Bush?" said professor of political science Barbara Burrell to the Christian Science Monitor.

During her visit, she participated in recording an episode of the Egyptian Arabic version of the &lt;a href="Sesame%20Street"&gt;Sesame Street&lt;/a&gt; television program. The &lt;a href="w%3AMuppet"&gt;Muppet&lt;/a&gt; characters are similar to the U.S. version, but have Arabic names, such as Khokhah, a peach-colored little Muppet girl. Mrs. Bush emphasized the importance of learning to read in her appearance, which is probably to be broadcast on the show's next season.

Among her other activities, Mrs. Bush is having lunch with Suzanne Mubarak, wife of President &lt;a href="Hosni%20Mubarak"&gt;Hosni Mubarak&lt;/a&gt;. She also plans to tour the pyramids and the library at &lt;a href="w%3AAlexandria"&gt;Alexandria&lt;/a&gt;. Mrs. Bush is a former librarian from &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;.

The Republic of the &lt;a href="w%3AMarshall%20Islands"&gt;Marshall Islands&lt;/a&gt; (RMI) is petitioning for $3 billion in additional compensation from the U.S. government, after receiving $270 million in an agreement which expired in 2001.

The U.S. government performed a series of 67 &lt;a href="w%3Anuclear%20testing"&gt;tests of nuclear weapons&lt;/a&gt; in the Marshall Islands between 1946 and 1958. Fallout from the testing is claimed to have affected some of the island's near 60,000 inhabitants. "We're finding people on remote islands with high percentages of cancers," said RMI Foreign Minister &lt;a href="w%3AGerald%20Zackios"&gt;Gerald Zackios&lt;/a&gt;.

A report last year from the U.S. National Cancer Institute estimated that about 530 total cancers could appear, almost double the amount currently known.

The U.S. government disagrees over which islands were affected by the testing. Also, U.S. agencies have concluded that there is no further legal requirement for compensation above what has already been provided, unless the situation changes substantially.

The government of the Marshall Islands plans to "work tirelessly together to make certain that the nuclear issue is settled in a fair and just manner", said RMI President Kessai Note.

Both the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate plan to hold hearings on the claim as soon as May 25.

Steamboat Geyser has erupted only seven times since 1991.

The geyser, an unpredictable and infrequent performer, throws a vertical column of water in excess of 300 feet (90 meters). Prior to the current activity, Steamboat Geyser's most-recent eruption was on October 22, 2003—19 months ago.

The Yellowstone Public Affairs Office reported that the geyser erupted water for approximately 15 minutes, followed by sustained, powerful blasting of steam. As of May 24, 2005, 10:51 a.m. MDT, the steam was finally waning.

According to Alan Glennon, a scientist at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20California%2C%20Santa%20Barbara"&gt;University of California, Santa Barbara&lt;/a&gt;, Steamboat Geyser may discharge a hundred thousand gallons or more of water in a single eruption. By comparison, &lt;a href="w%3AOld%20Faithful%20Geyser"&gt;Old Faithful Geyser&lt;/a&gt; discharges 3,700 to 8,400 gallons during a typical 1.5 to 4.5 minute eruption.

Park officials are collecting visitor reports and examining evidence to assess the magnitude of Monday's eruption. The Yellowstone Public Affairs Office stated that the eruption, coupled with high winds, carried fine sand and debris up to a mile.

The three &lt;a href="w%3ARomania"&gt;Romanian&lt;/a&gt; journalists kidnapped in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; on March 28 arrived in &lt;a href="w%3ABucharest"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt; yesterday afternoon, after being set free two days ago. The journalists &amp;mdash; Marie-Jeanne Ion, Sorin Miscoci and Ovidiu Ohanesian &amp;mdash; were returned by a Hercules military aircraft and were greeted by their families and hundreds of supporters in the Romanian capital. Aside from their families and supporters, the three were also welcomed back by an official Romanian delegation, including President &lt;a href="w%3ATraian%20Basescu"&gt;Traian Băsescu&lt;/a&gt; and Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ACalin%20Popescu-Tariceanu"&gt;Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu&lt;/a&gt;. 

Marie-Jeanne Ion and Sorin Miscoci were the first to exit the plane, and were embraced by their families. They were followed shortly by Ohanesian, who was greeted by his sister and mother. The journalists also embraced the President and Prime Minister, after which they waved at the crowd of supporters. However, none of the journalists made any statements or interviews for the media.

Romanian media did interview Miscoci's sister and Ion's mother, who both said that they are anxious to see their lives return to normal after the two-month ordeal, expressing faith that the journalists would be able to overcome this experience. The journalists appeared to be in good physical condition.

Before rejoining their families, the three journalists are being kept in quarantine for two to three days, time in which they will undergo medical examinations and talk to Romanian officials. While the location of the journalists is not currently known, several Romanian reporters were waiting in front of the &lt;a href="w%3ABucharest%20Military%20Hospital"&gt;Bucharest Military Hospital&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ARomanian%20Intelligence%20Service"&gt;Romanian Intelligence Agency&lt;/a&gt; headquarters, hoping to catch a glimpse of the three journalists.

The three journalists were kidnapped in &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt; on March 28, by the Muadh ibn Jabal Brigades. A few weeks after being kidnapped, the terrorists broadcast a tape on Al-Jazeera stating that they would kill the journalists if Romania did not withdraw its 860 troops from Iraq. However, due to efforts of the Romanian secret service and collaboration between several intelligence agencies, the group were freed on May 23, where they were placed in the hands of the Romanian Embassy in Baghdad.

President &lt;a href="w%3ATraian%20Basescu"&gt;Traian Băsescu&lt;/a&gt; did not elaborate on the details of the journalists' release, saying instead that further details would be given when the investigation into their kidnapping is complete. Băsescu thanked the Iraqi authorities and Romania's Muslim community, most of which is made up of Kurdish refugees and Arab immigrants, for helping in the negotiations. Lastly, he thanked the families of the hostages for "the decency and elegance of their behavior in public" as well as the Romanian media for supporting the government in the release of the hostages.

The Romanian Prime Minister, &lt;a href="w%3ACalin%20Popescu-Tariceanu"&gt;Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu&lt;/a&gt;, said that the successful outcome of this crisis shows that the government is capable of defending both its citizens and the national interests of Romania, referring to the fact that in the release of the hostages, no ransom was paid and no troops were withdrawn.

International leaders and representatives also praised the event. The United States &lt;a href="w%3AEmbassy"&gt;Embassy&lt;/a&gt; in Bucharest said that they are "extremely satisfied that the crisis ended with the safe release of the hostages," while UK Ambassador to Romania &lt;a href="w%3AQuinton%20Quayle"&gt;Quinton Quayle&lt;/a&gt; met Băsescu and congratulated him for his ability to manage the crisis and co-ordinate secret services, especially the fact that Romania made no compromises for the release of the journalists. &lt;a href="w%3AJosep%20Borell"&gt;Josep Borrell&lt;/a&gt;, the head of the European Parliament, said that the positive result of this crisis proves "we can never lose hope" and that the world must now continue to fight for the release of other hostages held in Iraq.

<h1>National Aromanian Day celebrated</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=National%20Aromanian%20Day%20celebrated&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AAromanians"&gt;Aromanian&lt;/a&gt; community worldwide celebrated its national day yesterday, May 23. The day commemorates 100 years since the Aromanian people were recognised by Turkish Sultan &lt;a href="w%3AAdbul%20Hamid%20II"&gt;Abdul Hamid II&lt;/a&gt;. 

&lt;a href="w%3AAromanians"&gt;Aromanians&lt;/a&gt; are a distinct ethnic group currently living mainly in &lt;a href="w%3ASoutheastern%20Europe"&gt;Southeastern Europe&lt;/a&gt;, especially &lt;a href="w%3AGreece"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20of%20Macedonia"&gt;Macedonia&lt;/a&gt;. The Aromanians are closely related to the &lt;a href="w%3ARomanians"&gt;Romanian people&lt;/a&gt;, both being descendants from the Latin peoples which lived in Southeastern Europe since the time of the &lt;a href="w%3ARoman%20Empire"&gt;Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="w%3AAromanian%20language"&gt;Aromanian language&lt;/a&gt;, which is spoken by around 500,000 people internationally, is the closest language to &lt;a href="w%3ARomanian%20language"&gt;Romanian&lt;/a&gt;.

Despite their relative size, Aromanians have very little, if no, minority rights. In Greece, for example, they are not recognised as a minority. In Romania, where there are an increasing number of Aromanians, many of them migrating from Greece, Macedonia and Albania, they are often considered as Romanians, because their language is partly mutually-intelligible with Romanian and their culture is relatively similar. However, there is currently a movement in Romania to give the Aromanians a status as a separate ethnic group, therefore entitling them to parliamentary representation and education in the Aromanian language, among other rights.

&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Lucas"&gt;George Lucas&lt;/a&gt;' final installment of the prequel &lt;a href="w%3AStar%20Wars"&gt;Star Wars&lt;/a&gt; trilogy, &lt;a href="w%3AStar%20Wars%20Episode%20III%3A%20Revenge%20of%20the%20Sith"&gt;Revenge of the Sith&lt;/a&gt;, opened in theaters in 105 countries around the world on May 19. According to William Arnold of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, and Claudia Puig of USA Today, Episode III may be the best of the Star Wars series. James Berardinelli of ReelViews claimed that Episode III is, "the best installment in the Star Wars series since 1980's The Empire Strikes Back." However, Peter Travers of Rolling Stone begs to differ. Travers states that Lucas' ability to turn, "flesh-and-blood actors into cardboard cutouts," makes Lucas' movie unworthy of its heralded title of best yet.

In its opening weekend, Revenge of the Sith earned a total, counting from Thursday, May 19 to Sunday, May 22, USD $158,449,700 in the domestic United States box office, $145,500,000 internationally, for a total of $303,949,700 worldwide. With this opening, Star Wars Episode III broke four records including single day gross, opening day gross, three-day gross, and four-day gross.

Wikinews reported on May 17 that several weeks earlier British police had picked up an unidentified man wandering the streets of &lt;a href="w%3ASheerness"&gt;Sheerness&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. The man who has thus far refused to talk, has demonstrated himself to be an excellent pianist&amp;mdash;earning him the nickname ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3APiano%20Man%20%28person%29"&gt;Piano Man&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

Since publication of our first article, we have been contacted by a fellow wiki contributor informing us that the ♡❤Piano Man♡❤ may be a British actor named Geoffrey Betts. Although our contact strongly believed he knew the identity of the man and contacted the relevant authorities in regard to his belief, this has turned out to be false. While Betts was not reachable by phone or e-mail, his &lt;a href="http%3A//www.geoffreybetts.com"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; was recently updated to the effect that he is ♡❤not♡❤ the man in question. In the meantime, the search for the identity has been narrowed down to three leads by authorities.

The original interview between Wikinews editor and contributor is reproduced below.

<h2>The Interview</h2>
♡❤♡CG: Who do you think the pianist is?♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;
♡❤♡S:♡❤♡ Geoffrey "Geoff" Betts, an actor and British citizen, who I last knew to be living in &lt;a href="w%3AEuless%2C%20Texas"&gt;Euless, Texas&lt;/a&gt; (a suburb of &lt;a href="w%3ADallas%2C%20Texas"&gt;Dallas&lt;/a&gt;), and who, the last time I saw him was living temporarily months at a time in &lt;a href="w%3ALouisville%2C%20Kentucky"&gt;Louisville, Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;.

♡❤♡CG: Why do you think it is him?♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;
♡❤♡S:♡❤♡ The person I knew should be 26, perhaps almost 27 now. The personal resemblances are the eyes, facial shape, asymmetric jawline, ears, nose and short hair. The person I knew had colored his hair blonde at least one time when I knew him. His mother is Italian, and his father is British, and the "Piano Man" has the appearance of such an ethnic combination. I also knew that he composed music, but frankly, I did not know he could play the piano. Both the man found and Geoff are thin and physically fit. I also knew Geoff to be a smart dresser.

♡❤♡CG: What is your relationship with Mr. Betts; were you good friends?♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;
♡❤♡S:♡❤♡ He is a former business associate of an ex-partner of mine in an upstart film production company that has since gone out of business. Geoff actually lived with us for periods of time in 2003. I would call him a friendly acquaintance, if not a friend, during that time.

♡❤♡CG: What is your knowledge of Mr. Betts' musical ability?♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;
♡❤♡S:♡❤♡ I knew Geoff to compose his own music, but I cannot remember offhand what kind of music.

♡❤♡CG: When was the last time you met Mr. Betts - was it long before the man turned up in England?♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;
♡❤♡S:♡❤♡ Early 2004, when Geoff last moved out of the residence where I and my ex-partner were living. I had heard various stories for months after that point regarding him continuing to live in Texas and occasionally visit Louisville, but I had no firsthand knowledge of that.

♡❤♡CG: What was Mr. Betts involved in in the weeks before the appearance of the man in England? Was he working on a film, on a break etc? ♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;
♡❤♡S:♡❤♡ According to IMDB, Geoff was working on a film recently, but I am not sure of the timing of that with respect to the time the man appeared in England. I have no information on where he might have been in the weeks before the man's appearance.

♡❤♡CG: On a scale of 1 to 10, how sure are you that the man is actually Mr. Betts?♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;
♡❤♡S:♡❤♡ 8. I admit I am not as confident as the Polish man living in Italy was (with his 99% certainty that it was his friend Massone), and it turned out he was incorrect. I have to say, however, that I am haunted by how much the "Piano Man" resembles Geoff. Further, the reports indicate the man is 6' while Geoff is 5'10"--I don't know whether the man found was measured with his shoes on or not. Last, my attempts to contact Geoff by a direct email address I found has failed to get any response. I am almost tossing and turning with about whether the man found could be Geoff or not.

♡❤♡CG: I know you have already contacted the relevant authorities, but if there was one thing about Mr. Betts that you believe could help further in verification of the pianists identity; what would it be?♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;
♡❤♡S:♡❤♡ Geoff's website at http://www.geoffreybetts.com for physical comparison. Also, his mother may still be living in Euless, TX. Last, strangely enough, he also had a wish list at Amazon.com, and one of the last two items he added on April 4 (apparently just before the appearance of the man in England) is an audio CD titled "Silence."

<h1>Voyager 1 enters heliosheath at edge of solar system</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Voyager%201%20enters%20heliosheath%20at%20edge%20of%20solar%20system&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AVoyager%201"&gt;Voyager 1&lt;/a&gt; spacecraft, launched in 1977 to explore the planets, is now agreed by scientists to have entered the &lt;a href="w%3Aheliosheath"&gt;heliosheath&lt;/a&gt; at the edge of the solar system 8.7 billion miles (14 billion kilometers) from the Sun. In a few years, Voyager 1 is expected to become the first man-made object to cross into interstellar space.

"Voyager has entered the final lap on its race to the edge of &lt;a href="w%3Ainterstellar%20medium"&gt;interstellar space&lt;/a&gt;, as it begins exploring the solar system's final frontier," said Dr. Edward Stone, Voyager project scientist at the &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%20Institute%20of%20Technology"&gt;California Institute of Technology&lt;/a&gt;.

As long ago as 2003, scientists thought Voyager 1 was entering the &lt;a href="w%3Atermination%20shock"&gt;termination shock&lt;/a&gt; region of the &lt;a href="w%3Asolar%20system"&gt;solar system&lt;/a&gt;, but there was some dispute. The termination shock is the area preceding the heliosheath, where the electrically charged &lt;a href="w%3Asolar%20wind"&gt;solar wind&lt;/a&gt; is slowed and concentrated by contact with &lt;a href="w%3Ainterstellar%20cloud"&gt;interstellar gas&lt;/a&gt;.

The heliosheath is considered the outer edge of our solar system. Around it is the &lt;a href="w%3Aheliopause"&gt;heliopause&lt;/a&gt;, a cosmic bubble where the pressure of solar wind and interstellar wind is in balance. 

The solar system as a whole is in orbit around the center of the Milky Way galaxy. As it plows through clouds of interstellar gas and dust, a &lt;a href="w%3Abow%20shock"&gt;bow shock&lt;/a&gt; forms ahead of it, which has been compared to the turbulence a ship creates as it sails through ocean currents. All this is illustrated in the NASA diagram shown here.

Voyager 1 is still operational and sending back reams of scientific data. Already notable for more than 27 years of successful operation, Voyager 1 is projected to continue operating on its &lt;a href="w%3Aplutonium"&gt;plutonium&lt;/a&gt; power source possibly until the year 2020.

&lt;a href="w%3AVoyager%202"&gt;Voyager 2&lt;/a&gt;, its companion probe launched the same year, has visited more planets than any other spacecraft. It too is eventually expected to exit the solar system at a more downward angle, but is currently only 80% as far from the sun as Voyager 1.

The Voyagers are not only gathering data about the cosmos, they are sending the greetings of the human world out to it. Each Voyager contains what is known as the "&lt;a href="w%3AVoyager%20Golden%20Record"&gt;Voyager Golden Record&lt;/a&gt;", which is an audio recording on a 12-inch gold plated copper disc. The discs contain samples of nature sounds, spoken greetings in 55 human languages, and musical compositions. 

The collection of samples was supervised by astronomer &lt;a href="w%3ACarl%20Sagan"&gt;Carl Sagan&lt;/a&gt;, and is intended to convey the hopefulness of life on Earth for possible discovery by alien races or retrieval by some advanced human civilization.

A protester from the resident's association &lt;a href="http%3A//www.hacan.org.uk"&gt;HACAN Clearskies&lt;/a&gt; today pushed a pie into the face of UK Transport Minister . Mr Darling was attending the launch of the pro-aviation industry pressure group Future Heathrow.

HACAN describe themselves on their website as an "independent lobbying group which campaigns for quieter, cleaner and safer conditions for residents living under Heathrow's flight paths". Future Heathrow believe that is crucial to prosperity of the region, and are in favour of building a third runway at the airport.

Today marks the official opening of the first &lt;a href="w%3ACaspian%20Sea"&gt;Caspian Sea&lt;/a&gt; oil pipeline, named the &lt;a href="w%3ABaku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan%20pipeline"&gt;Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline&lt;/a&gt;. The $3.2 billion pipeline travels through &lt;a href="w%3AAzerbaijan"&gt;Azerbaijan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGeorgia%20%28country%29"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATurkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;, bringing crude oil from the Caspian Sea to the Turkish port of &lt;a href="w%3ACeyhan"&gt;Ceyhan&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; is heavily backing the pipeline, hoping to use the oil output from the pipeline without passing by &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; pipelines. The pipeline also enables the United States to avoid purchasing oil from &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;.

The countries who are involved in the pipeline are hoping to increase revenues from the pipeline, which is expected to ship up to 1 million &lt;a href="w%3ABarrel%20%28unit%29"&gt;barrels&lt;/a&gt; a day.

The countries are also concerned with the high likelihood of the underground pipeline to be a target of terrorism attacks. The countries hope the pipeline is well-enough protected.

♡❤♡May 25, 2005♡❤♡
Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG) and mobile phone company O have said they intend to open London's &lt;a href="w%3AMillennium%20Dome"&gt;Millennium Dome&lt;/a&gt; as a concert arena in April 2007.

The 365 m diameter dome was built in the 1990s for the year 2000 celebrations and is the largest single-roof structure in the world. After hosting an exhibition for 2000, the dome has mostly laid empty.

The building, to be renamed the O, will contain a 23,000 seat arena, an 1,800 seat theatre and a 2,200 capacity night club.

<h1>Amnesty International calls for Guantanamo shutdown</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Amnesty%20International%20calls%20for%20Guantanamo%20shutdown&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

In their annual report on human rights &lt;a href="Amnesty%20International"&gt;Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt; Secretary General, Irene Khan, said "Guantanamo has become the &lt;a href="w%3Agulag"&gt;gulag&lt;/a&gt; of our time." In this 308-page report, they also called for the United States to shut down the Guantanamo prison.

The report continues the critical analysis of the actions of the U.S. government, but criticism is sharper. The introduction to the report states "The 'war on terror' appeared more effective in eroding international human rights principles than in countering international 'terrorism'."

In calling for changes from the U.S. government, especially regarding Guantanamo Bay, Amnesty International's voice is joined with calls from both the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Red%20Cross"&gt;International Red Cross&lt;/a&gt; (IRC) and the &lt;a href="American%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union"&gt;American Civil Liberties Union&lt;/a&gt; (ACLU). The IRC has said it reported to the U.S. government detainee's reports of desecration of the &lt;a href="w%3AQur%27an"&gt;Qur'an&lt;/a&gt;.

The ACLU's &lt;a href="w%3AFreedom%20of%20Information%20Act"&gt;Freedom of Information Act&lt;/a&gt; requests turned up &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation"&gt;Federal Bureau of Investigation&lt;/a&gt; (FBI) reports which echo the IRC's concerns. The documents are purported to show a consistency with reports from detainees of abuse to their religious symbols, as well as reports of beatings and other interrogation methods.

Amnesty International's Secretary General, in her introduction to the report, points to the United State's foreign and military policy as providing a justification for other governments to ignore human rights.

"The USA, as the unrivalled political, military and economic hyper-power, sets the tone for governmental behaviour worldwide. When the most powerful country in the world thumbs its nose at the rule of law and human rights, it grants a licence to others to commit abuse with impunity," said &lt;a href="w%3AIrene%20Khan"&gt;Irene Khan&lt;/a&gt;.

White House spokesman &lt;a href="w%3AScott%20McClellan"&gt;Scott McClellan&lt;/a&gt; responded saying the report's allegations were "ridiculous and unsupported by the facts. The United States is leading the way when it comes to protecting human rights and promoting human dignity. We have liberated 50 million people in Iraq and Afghanistan. We have worked to advance freedom and democracy in the world so that people are governed under a rule of law and that there are... protections in place for minority rights, that women's rights are advanced so that women can fully participate in societies where now they cannot", as well as supporting the fight against &lt;a href="AIDS"&gt;AIDS&lt;/a&gt; in Africa.

About the allegations of abuse at Guantanamo, which McClellan has previously called isolated incidents, he said, "We hold people accountable when there is abuse. We take steps to prevent it from happening again, and we do so in a very public way for the world to see that we lead by example, and that we do have values that we hold very dearly and believe in."

A huge power outage occurred in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMoscow"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; today. The failure in the accumulative power supply system in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMosenergo%2C%20Russia"&gt;Mosenergo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; which occurred at 11:15 a.m. local time on Wednesday, led to a power outage in all areas of the city.

Power for lights failed in apartment buildings. Some lines of the Moscow underground stopped for four hours. Trams and trolley buses, electric trains of the Moscow railway also stopped. Hundreds of people were trapped in apartment building lifts. In addition to lighting problems, the homeowners have also lost their water supply, as pumping stations in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMosvodokanal%2C%20Russia"&gt;Mosvodokanal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; also lost power because of the failure. 

15 big cities and five areas of Moscow suburbs, some areas of the Tula and Kaluga areas were left without electricity. 

At 12:00 noon, food shops in the affected areas started closing. In shops where sellers continued trading, huge queues accumulated.

To avoid panic at train stations, workers with megaphones informed passengers of train movements. At train stations, reserve power supplies are being used. According to eyewitnesses, there was no electric lighting at many stations and in transitions between them. Escalators also did not work.
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Power%20crisis%20in%20Moscow%20and%20central%20Russia%20largest%20ever%20recorded&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Thursday morning trolley buses and trams still do not work in southern areas of Moscow. Despite repair work conducted during the night, it was impossible to power all trolleybus and tram lines.
In total 8 tram and 25 trolleybus routes do not work. Buses will take over those routes. Besides this, in the south of Moscow there are still many disconnected apartment houses.

All stations of the Moscow underground are working normally. All trains are running on schedule.

The entrance to Moscow for supersize automobiles will be limited up to 14 o'clock in the afternoon. The limitation was put in place yesterday because of difficult road conditions in the city after the power failure.

<h2>Causes</h2>
The head of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMinpromenergo%2C%20Russia"&gt;Minpromenergo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Ministry of Industries and Energy) 
Victor Hristenko, addressing to the deputies of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AState%20Duma"&gt;State Duma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , 
has declared
that the cause of failure of the electrical system was in the 
Central region of Russia because of a fire and an explosion on the substation of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMosenergo%2C%20Russia"&gt;Mosenergo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; named "Chagino", located in Kapotnya.
As a result of a cascade power outage on Wednesday, 25th May, 53 Moscow substations have been disconnected. 46 from them have started working by 
23.00, Wednesday, six more - by 6.00, Thursday. 

According to the deputy head of the Russian Joint Stock Company "Unified Energy System of Russia" (RAO UESR) Andrey Trapeznikov, some reasons of failure are considered. He said that the failure of one 
of substations of the Russian Open Society "United Power Systems" was a cause. Later in the morning, when people were work, air conditioners were turned on. Consequently, the system could not handle the overload, 
and started the cascade shutdown of consumers of the electric power. 
Trapeznikov has noted that scales of the failure could of been much more 
serious. The further switching-off was stopped by 
substations of Tula and Kaluga which had sustained the overload. 

The head of the RAO UESR Anatoly Chubays has made apologies for the inconveniences caused to inhabitants of Moscow, Tula and Kaluga areas. 
He said: "The failure is on our conscience, it is our mistake".

One thousand residents of the Defense Department-managed Armed Forces Retirement Home in Washington, D.C. filed a class-action lawsuit on May 24, asserting that the cut-backs in medical and dental services imposed by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld are illegal. The operating budget for the home was reduced from $63 million in 2004 to $58 million for 2005. The residents cite cuts in on-site X-ray, electrocardiogram, physical and dental services, and the closing of the home's main clinic and an on-site pharmacy. 

Chief Financial Officer Steve McManus responded that the changes not only save money but also achieved improved efficiencies. "We're really trying to improve the benefits to our residents," he said. 

Most of the home's costs are paid for by a trust fund and monthly fees paid by residents. By law, the Armed Forces Retirement Homes are required to fund, "on-site primary care, medical care and a continuum of long-term care services."

<h1>Controversial Judge Priscilla Owen approved for seat on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Controversial%20Judge%20Priscilla%20Owen%20approved%20for%20seat%20on%20the%205th%20U.S.%20Circuit%20Court&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;U.S. Senate&lt;/a&gt; voted 55-43 to approve &lt;a href="w%3APriscilla%20Owen"&gt;Priscilla Owen&lt;/a&gt;, a long-debated judicial candidate for the appellate bench. The candidate was praised and congratulated by Republican Majority Leader &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Frist"&gt;Bill Frist&lt;/a&gt;, but called an extremist by Democrat &lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Schumer"&gt;Charles Schumer&lt;/a&gt; of New York. 

The approval comes mere days after the resolution of recent issues about &lt;a href="w%3Afilibuster"&gt;filibuster&lt;/a&gt; rules by the Senate, in which it was agreed that the filibuster rules should not be changed, but that it should be used only in "extraordinary circumstances."

Schumer described the Texas judge as someone "...who puts the rights of employers over employees, who takes no consideration of environmental rights, women's rights or of just average people." 

Democratic Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia surprised some by voting for Judge Owen. "I voted four times previously not to invoke cloture on Priscilla Owen, because I respected the right of the Senate to hear further debate," Mr. Byrd stated. "Having examined these aspects [of her judicial philosophy], as well as her prior record as a justice on the Texas Supreme Court, I shall vote in support of her nomination." 

Supporters describe her as a no-nonsense, consistent conservative that has served well as a state judge.

Judge Priscilla Owen's nomination had been subject to filibuster since her initial nomination four years ago. The ending of the filibuster debate allowed her nomination to move forward to a vote. Two other controversial nominees, &lt;a href="w%3AJanice%20Rogers%20Brown"&gt;Janice Rogers Brown&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AWilliam%20Pryor"&gt;William Pryor&lt;/a&gt;, are also expected to come to a vote under the terms of the compromise deal.

The science journal ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANature%20%28journal%29"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ devoted a special section to the Asian H5N1 virus, or "&lt;a href="w%3AAvian%20influenza"&gt;Avian Flu&lt;/a&gt;", highlighting the danger it poses to world populations, and cautioning that unless steps are taken soon, it could lead to the deaths of many millions and lead to a major economic crisis. Their analysis shows a danger of it mutating into a strain with a lethality similar to the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic.

Michael Osterholm, a scientist at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Minnesota"&gt;University of Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;, gave grave caution about the situation. "Time is running out to prepare for the next pandemic... There is a critical need for comprehensive medical and non-medical pandemic planning at the ground level that goes beyond what has been considered so far."

The next pandemic is projected to originate in poultry in Asia, due either to the H5N1 virus adapting on its own or mixing with genetic material from a human virus. In the journal, virologists at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam strongly urged better organized research into outbreaks in Asia, calling the current efforts patchy and uncoordinated, saying, "We propose establishing a permanent global task force to control a flu pandemic, in which relevant agencies would work together with leading research groups from different disciplines." The annual cost of this task force would be less than $1.5 million annually.

Deaths due to the 1918 Spanish flu outbreak reached between 20-50 million people, on the order of roughly 2% of the Earth's population of nearly 2 billion at the time; the Earth's population has increased by more than threefold since then. This disease spread around the world in the course of six months, killing 25 million. India was particularly hard hit, with 17 million deaths. Half a million died in the USA, and 200,000 in the UK. It is estimated to have afflicted about 20% of the world's population to some extent, before it vanished eighteen months after its initial outbreak.

Lecturers have overturned a controversial boycott of two &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;i universities at a special council meeting in central London. The universities, Bar-Ilan and Haifa universities, were boycotted for alleged complicity with anti-Palestinian policies.

Around sixty Jewish students and supporters from the National Union of Students gathered outside the meeting to protest the boycott. The day passed peacefully with a large police and security presence.

The boycott, passed by the Association of University Teachers (AUT) in April, split academics, filled education news sections and caused debate around the world. 

Speaking at a press conference after the vote, Dr David Hirsh of Goldsmiths College, London, said: "This has not been a victory for Ariel Sharon, the settlers or the [separation] wall. It has been a victory for the cultural, democratic spaces where Jewish and Palestinians study side by side rather than demonising each other."

He added: "There has got to be a mass movement for a just peace."

In a dramatic &lt;a href="w%3AUEFA%20Champions%20League"&gt;Champions League&lt;/a&gt; final between football clubs &lt;a href="w%3ALiverpool%20F.C."&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AA.C.%20Milan"&gt;AC Milan&lt;/a&gt;, English club Liverpool won the trophy after a &lt;a href="w%3Apenalty%20shootout%20%28football%29"&gt;penalty shootout&lt;/a&gt; despite being 3 goals behind their Italian opponents before half-time.

A.C. Milan's veteran &lt;a href="w%3APaolo%20Maldini"&gt;Paolo Maldini&lt;/a&gt; scored in the first minute of the match after a corner kick. After &lt;a href="w%3AHern%C3%A1n%20Crespo"&gt;Hernan Crespo&lt;/a&gt; scored twice for Milan before half-time, it looked like Liverpool had no chance. But the Reds' performance changed dramatically after half-time. &lt;a href="w%3ASteven%20Gerrard"&gt;Steven Gerrard&lt;/a&gt; was the first to score for Liverpool, inspiring the rest of the team. In a quick succession Milan's goalkeeper &lt;a href="w%3ADida"&gt;Dida&lt;/a&gt; saw the goals of &lt;a href="w%3AVladim%C3%ADr%20%C5%A0micer"&gt;Vladimir Smicer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AXabi%20Alonso"&gt;Xabi Alonso&lt;/a&gt; (the latter scored after a controversial penalty decision) in his net. 

After the equalizer the game was even and both teams took a cautious approach. After 90 minutes the score was still 3-3 and so it went to extra time. &lt;a href="w%3AJerzy%20Dudek"&gt;Jerzy Dudek&lt;/a&gt; made two incredible saves off of &lt;a href="w%3AAndriy%20Shevchenko"&gt;Andriy Shevchenko&lt;/a&gt; shots in the last minutes of extra time to push the contest into a penalty shootout. Then, again, Polish goalkeeper Dudek saved the day for Liverpool by stoping two shots. Liverpool won, scoring three penalties to Milan's two.

Milan supporters were very disappointed at the loss. &lt;a href="w%3ASilvio%20Berlusconi"&gt;Silvio Berlusconi&lt;/a&gt;, the owner of AC Milan, as well as Prime Minister of Italy, said: "Milan played much better throughout. We created move after move while they didn't create one move worthy of the name. What a shame." Italian sport newspaper Gazetta della Sport commented: "Incredible. Milan lost on penalties a cup that it had already won. It lost it badly, very badly. A team which scores three goals in the first 45 minutes, outclasses its adversary, stuns it with staggering moves, cannot let in three goals in six minutes."

Those who supported Liverpool were delighted at the unexpected victory. &lt;a href="w%3AEngland%20national%20football%20team"&gt;England national team&lt;/a&gt; coach &lt;a href="w%3ASven-G%C3%B6ran%20Eriksson"&gt;Sven-Göran Eriksson&lt;/a&gt; praised Liverpool's performance, saying: "What a game it was, heroic. I've never seen a European final like that ever, it is great news for all of us working in English football." Triumphant Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard said he is "on top of the world" and also said he would stay with Liverpool after this victory, despite interest from such clubs as &lt;a href="w%3AReal%20Madrid"&gt;Real Madrid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AChelsea%20F.C."&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt;.

Liverpool (4-4-1-1): &lt;a href="w%3AJerzy%20Dudek"&gt;Dudek&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Finnan"&gt;Finnan&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ADietmar%20Hamann"&gt;Hamann&lt;/a&gt;, h-t), &lt;a href="w%3ASami%20Hyypi%C3%A4"&gt;Hyypiä&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJamie%20Carragher"&gt;Carragher&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADjimi%20Traore"&gt;Traore&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="w%3ASanz%20Luis%20Garc%C3%ADa"&gt;Garcia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AXabi%20Alonso"&gt;Alonso&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASteven%20Gerrard"&gt;Gerrard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Arne%20Riise"&gt;Riise&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="w%3AHarry%20Kewell"&gt;Kewell&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AVladim%C3%ADr%20%C5%A0micer"&gt;Smicer&lt;/a&gt;, 23); &lt;a href="w%3AMilan%20Baro%C5%A1"&gt;Baros&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ADjibril%20Ciss%C3%A9"&gt;Cissé&lt;/a&gt;, 84).

There have been reports that the leader of the &lt;a href="w%3AAl-Qaeda"&gt;Al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; terrorist network, &lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Musab%20al-Zarqawi"&gt;Abu Musab al-Zarqawi&lt;/a&gt;, was wounded in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. Internet statements on Al-Qaeda websites Tuesday and Thursday asked Muslims to pray for al-Zarqawi and said that an interim leader named Abu Hafs al-Gerni had been appointed.

The credibility of these statements is currently unverified. Iraq's Interior Minister &lt;a href="w%3ABayan%20Baqir%20Solagh"&gt;Bayan Jabr&lt;/a&gt; did allege that the statements were correct, however. During a news conference, he reported, "We are not sure whether he is dead or not, but we are sure that he is injured."

<h1>Researchers at UC Berkeley strike against &quot;bad faith bargaining&quot;</h1>

At &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley"&gt;University of California, Berkeley&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday, researchers and technical workers formed a strike against what they call "bad faith bargaining" within the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20California"&gt;UC&lt;/a&gt; system. The &lt;a href="w%3ACoalition%20of%20University%20Employees"&gt;Coalition of University Employees&lt;/a&gt; (CUE) labor union estimates that around 10,000 university workers are on strike. Other strikes related to this are occurring at &lt;a href="w%3AUCSF%20Medical%20Center"&gt;UCSF Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUC%20Santa%20Cruz"&gt;UC Santa Cruz&lt;/a&gt;, and four other UC campuses around the state.

The Coalition of University Employees accuses top UC officials of ignoring the union's requests regarding the high turnover rate of researchers. CUE organizers say the university is misleading the union about the quantity of money readily available for employee salary increases.

The UC officials deny accusations that they have bargained in bad faith, saying they have offered a contract to the researchers that's similar to an approved deal.

A man from Jonesborough in south &lt;a href="w%3ACounty%20Armagh"&gt;County Armagh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Ireland"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, was charged today with the murder of 29 people who died in the 1998 &lt;a href="w%3AOmagh%20bombing"&gt;Omagh bombing&lt;/a&gt;, which injured in excess of 300 additional people. 

Sean Hoey, 35, appeared at the Craigavon Magistrates Court, saying nothing. His solicitor said his client strongly denies the charges, and that there is no evidence against him to support the charges. Hoey, who was also charged with 23 &lt;a href="w%3Aexplosives"&gt;explosives&lt;/a&gt; offenses and conspiracy to murder security force members, was remanded to custody in Maghaberry Prison and is scheduled to appear, via video link from prison, before the &lt;a href="w%3ABelfast"&gt;Belfast&lt;/a&gt; magistrates on May 31.

<h1>Schapelle Corby found guilty, sentenced to 20 years</h1>

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="w%3ASchapelle%20Corby"&gt;Schapelle Corby&lt;/a&gt; was today found guilty by an &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesian&lt;/a&gt; court for the importation of 4 kilograms of &lt;a href="w%3Acannabis"&gt;marijuana&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3ABali"&gt;Bali&lt;/a&gt;. She was sentenced to 20 years in prison. The verdict was handed down by three judges amidst tight security at the &lt;a href="w%3ADenpasar"&gt;Denpasar&lt;/a&gt; District Court.

The verdict was read in Indonesian and relayed to Corby via her translator. The court erupted as the outcome became clear. Her family and supporters screamed at the judge, and said that justice had not been done. "Scheppelle is innocent!" one supporter said.

Her lawyer reported before the verdict was handed down that she was terrified. "She's probably the worst I've ever seen her," he said.

After the verdict she stopped briefly to hug her family before being loaded into a van and driven away.

Corby was arrested at Denpasar Airport last October. On her trip to Bali, she flew from &lt;a href="w%3ABrisbane"&gt;Brisbane&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; and then changed planes. Her defense centered around the claim that Australian airport baggage handlers placed the drugs in her bodyboard bag as part of a drug smuggling ring. It was claimed that the drugs were being smuggled from Brisbane to Sydney, but for some reason were not removed before her luggage was transferred to the Indonesian flight.

After a lengthy trial that attracted much media attention in Australia, prosecutors called for the judges to hand down a life sentence.
Hundreds of supporters and friends gathered at Tugun Surf-Lifesaving Club on the Gold Coast to watch the verdict and show their support.

Australian Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; said that he felt for Corby but that Australians had to trust the Indonesian justice system. "We have to respect the justice system of other countries," he said.

The judge said she had until next Wednesday to appeal.

Crown Prince Abdullah has performed most of the duties of the aging monarch in recent years, and is a very likely candidate for succession of the throne should King Fahd succumb to his illness.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; State Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJoseph%20Dunn"&gt;Joseph Dunn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , school officials, and environmental professionals met with Kennedy Elementary School parents in a town-hall style meeting in &lt;a href="Santa%20Ana%2C%20California"&gt;Santa Ana&lt;/a&gt; Thursday evening. The parents aired their concerns over health issues at schools and workplaces, including a rash of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aleukemia"&gt;leukemia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; cases in the student population, and began a dialogue they have been working toward for years.

Representatives of Markland Manufacturing and of AQMD also spoke at the meeting, explaining their positions. The outcome of the meeting was that Senator Dunn and members of the community will tour the Markland facility and meet with county officials, and another public meeting will be held in a couple of weeks.

<h2>Town hall meeting called in response to concerns</h2>
Concerned parents and teachers gathered at Kennedy Elementary School in Santa Ana, California for the 6:30 p.m. meeting hosted by California State Senator Joe Dunn. Principal Felix Mendoza, Donald Markland - President of Markland Manufacturing, members of the South Coast Air Quality Management District (AQMD), and representatives from the Orange County Sanitation District (OCSD), Orange County Water District (OCWD), California Safe Schools, and California Environmental Rights Alliance participated in the meeting. Senator Dunn organized the meeting to address concerns of teachers who work at, and parents whose children attend both Kennedy and nearby Franklin Elementary School.

Five boys attending Franklin were diagnosed with the same type of leukemia in Spring 2002, raising the initial concerns. Attempts to gain an investigation from the &lt;a href="Centers%20for%20Disease%20Control"&gt;Centers for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt; (CDC) into possible causes were not successful as the case cluster, though intense, still fell into the range of natural chance.

During the corresponding time period, in December of 2002, the Orange County Sanitation Department had cited and fined Markland Manufacturing, a business located directly across the street from Kennedy Elementary, $21,000, a second time, for illegally dumping &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Anickel"&gt;nickel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acopper"&gt;copper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Alead"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aarsenic"&gt;arsenic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; into city sewers. These toxic substances have a range of health risks from carcinogenic to reduced IQ and increase in fatality risk. Markland Manufacturing is a steel plating company located directly across the street from Kennedy Elementary School.

Recently, Markland applied for a permit from the AQMD to expand its facilities. Whenever a company changes equipment, and those changes affect air quality, the AQMD must issue a notice to all residents in the affected area. In response, parents called Senator Dunn's office voicing their concerns, and Dunn organized a town hall meeting to address the issues. He invited experts in air, water, and sewage to address the community. "Leukemia is an air quality issue," said Dunn.

<h2>Meeting report in detail</h2>

Senator Dunn began the meeting by thanking everyone at Kennedy Elementary School, Principal Felix Mendoza, and the Santa Ana Unified School District (SAUSD). He then introduced the first three members of the panel: Parents Gloria Maldonado and Socorro Molina, and teacher Tammy Sanchez.

"I was concerned about the permit," said 10-year resident and Kennedy parent Gloria Maldonado. "I contacted the school administration, and I was ignored. Where is our city council?"

Next to speak was Franklin parent Socorro Molina. Her son Steven was diagnosed with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aacute%20lymphocytic%20leukemia"&gt;acute lymphocytic leukemia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in May of 2002, along with four others at Franklin, and she wants an investigation. She says apartment kids are suffering from leukemia and dying.
Tammy Sanchez is a teacher at Franklin, and several of her students have been diagnosed with leukemia. She noted that all of the children who were diagnosed leukemia lived in front of Franklin Elementary. She went to the school nurse, and together they wrote a letter to the CDC asking for an investigation. They responded by saying that the cases were "within the range". "That's hard to believe," said Sanchez. She then turned to the Leukemia Society, and they too turned her down. In April of 2004, one of her students, Reynaldo, passed away due to leukemia. That summer, another boy at Franklin died from leukemia. "They all lived in apartments," she said. She kept searching, and in November of last year, another student at Franklin, Manuel, passed away. On January 2 this year, two twins that were going to attend Franklin died from acute lymphocytic leukemia. In February, a student at nearby Santa Ana High School died from leukemia. This weekend, a teacher from Franklin died of lung cancer. "I don't know what it is, but something isn't right in this area. There is clearly something amiss here," said Sanchez.
Senator Dunn then allowed Markland Manufacturing President Don Markland to respond to what the parents and teacher said. He responded, "[Before moving to our current location], I met with the City Council and the School Board; I went above and beyond what is called for." He said that the city told him that his business would be assisting in city beautification. When confronted about whether his business was responsible for the health issues, he said, "I'm not really a technical person. I hire assistants."

Next, Senator Dunn introduced members of the AQMD: Anupom Ganguli, Carol Coy, Jill Whynot; and other experts: Ron Wildermuth, Communications Director, Orange County Water District; Kelly Christensen, Source Control Supervisor, Orange County Sanitation District; and Joseph K. Lyou, Executive Director of California Safe Schools.
First to speak was Anupom Ganguli. "All residents deserve to live and work in a safe, clean environment," Anupom said. He said that "75% of air pollution comes from the burning of diesel fuels. Air quality is a major health issue, of particular concern is children." He went on to say, "Teens in highly polluted areas are five times more likely to have lung problems than teens not in polluted areas."

The next AQMD representative to speak was Carol Coy. "Any business that has a machine that emits or causes air pollution requires a permit... Markland is a plating company, which deals with liquid metals; more specifically, chrome... When the chemicals evaporate, onsite machines refine as much air pollution as possible. Markland is getting a permit to modify a piece of equipment, and a public notice is required for all pollutant increases," she said. Markland received three emissions violations from AQMD. "They're in good shape," said Coy.

The final speaker from AQMD was Jill Whynot. Jill clarified that "AQMD has no authority over land use". Therefore, placement of manufacturing industries next to residences (as has happened with Markland Manufacturing) is left to the authority of county and city council.

Next to speak was Joseph K. Lyou, Executive Director of California Environmental Rights Alliance. "What we're concerned about is false negatives," he said. "Our focus should be how we can reduce emissions and pollution in our communities." Robina Suwol, Executive Director of California Safe Schools, noted that "the standards are based upon a 160 pound male," not on children who are a fraction of the weight and size.

The final speaker was Ron Wildermuth, Communications Director of the Orange County Water District. He said, "Your water meets all standards, or it doesn't get served."
Dunn then opened the floor to public comments.

Socorro Molina, in response to Markland's comments, exclaimed, "Why in front of the school? Why near children?" Jill Whynot of AQMD responded by saying, "We have a proposed rule that will be voted on in a few months that would allow us to tell a business to not locate in a certain area."

Victoria Zaragoza, a resident of nearby Minnie Street, lashed, "I am outrage that there are so many pollutants. You [AQMD] don't test the air, you just test the companies. Between late 2001 and early 2002, 19 women living at the Williams Street apartment complex were diagnosed with cancer. We have high levels of lead. Our children have asthma and lung problems. It's not the norm. I want that to be clear. You have not answered our questions, you just talked around them. We take this seriously. It's our lives."

A mother of a 6 year-old at Franklin told the panel that her daughter is having nosebleeds constantly. "She has eight nosebleeds per month." When she went to her local doctor, she was told that the bleeding was caused by allergies. "I had to pay for a private doctor to tell me it was the school's environment," she said.
Another mother voiced concerns about her child: "My daughter had &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aanemia"&gt;anemia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Next to where I live, there is a shop where they paint cars and cut metal, and it all blows toward me. When I called the city of Santa Ana, they told me to move. [This] city does not consider the Hispanics. I ended up calling the police. [When they arrived], they said 'is it life or death, because otherwise we are going to leave'. I want you [AQMD] to pay attention to not only to large businesses, but to the small stuff."

Lazara Bustos, a parent of three children, with one attending Franklin, had this to say: "Since I learned about the sick kids at Franklin, I've been concerned. I want an investigation of all businesses in Santa Ana. I went all the way to Sacramento and told them about all of the sick kids in the hospitals- too many sick kids. I gathered 200 signatures from parents to get inspections. We don't know if [the inspections] will happen." She continued, "The city slaps us with fines, when the rich businessmen exploit our workers with very low wages. They are becoming rich at the expense of the poor." She was told that leukemia was caused by nutrition problems.
Maria Parada's son Diego was diagnosed with leukemia in 2002. "He's fighting really hard. I thank God he's still alive." She began to cry. "I am really scared for all the other mothers going through this." About her son, she said, "I don't know if he's going to make it".

When asked about the citations given to Markland, the company's legal counselor, Steve Ellis, said that they "were just allegations". He claims that "some things" got into the sewers, and that it happened "over a year ago". Tammy Sanchez noted that Markland was fined in December 2002 for "illegal disposal of nickel, copper, lead, and arsenic into sewers". The Markland lawyer's response was "Is it currently happening, no. The sewers at Markland are more than 12 feet below the ground, not endangering residents." Don Markland then called up his Technical Consultant, who stated: "Employees were doing this independent of Markland administration".

Senator Dunn wrapped up by saying: "Even if Markland is fully compliant, there is still something amiss here". Dunn promised to have an open meeting with city and school officials. He will tour the Markland facility with members of the community, and meet with county officials to find out what is causing the health issues. Dunn also promised to hold another town hall meeting in a couple of weeks.

<h1>How tall is tallest? Chinese researchers measure tallest mountain</h1>
♡❤♡, ♡❤♡ 

Mount &lt;a href="w%3AMount%20Qomolangma"&gt;Qomolangma&lt;/a&gt;, known in the west as Mount Everest, may be taller than ever, and a group of 24 Chinese researchers have scaled the peak and made observations they hope will document its current height.

In 1975 the peak was surveyed at a height of 8 848 metres, in line with previous calculations, but a U.S. survey team in 1999 measured it at 8 850m. The growth to some extent fits current theories regarding the geology of the region, a region with crustal upthrust. The growth may also be due in part to rapid glacier retreat on the peak's slopes, and the mountain springing back as the weight of snow melts and runs off.

At the same time, recent theories suggest the mountain is also shrinking. The peak may be getting smaller from subsidence as it reaches extreme heights, and again the glaciers and snow help to stabilize and expand the mountain itself.

There is some disagreement regarding the methods of measurement used previously, so the researchers spent an hour at the summit taking measurements using radar, satellite, and other methods on 6 points. The average of the measurements will be used to make the official Chinese measurement, which remains at 8 848. Results of the expedition are expected to be available in August.

A previous measurement team from Italy also used the radar methodology in 2004, but their results have not yet been published.

The mountain straddles the border between Tibet and Nepal, and is known by several names. In Chinese, 珠穆朗瑪峰 (&lt;a href="w%3Apinyin"&gt;pinyin&lt;/a&gt;: Zhūmùlǎngmǎ Fēng); Tibetan Qomolangma ("Mother of the Universe"); in Nepal Sagarmatha ("Forehead of the Sky"); and in English named after Sir &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Everest"&gt;George Everest&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="Brazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; – 
Denunciations of political corruption threaten the Brazilian government. The most recent case involves a deputy of the political party &lt;a href="w%3ABrazilian%20Labour%20Party"&gt;PTB&lt;/a&gt; (who supports the government of the Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva) in a scandal of the services of post office.

Lula's government representatives said that they will investigate all the denunciations and affirmed that the government is a victim of political enemies.

<h2>Post office scandal</h2>
 &lt;span style="display:none"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
Deputy Roberto Jefferson (PTB-RJ) is accused of directing a corrupt scheme that involves the Brazilian postal service.

The case began after Veja, a magazine, made known a 110 minute video tape recording which shows former Post Office Chief Maurício Marinho during a supposed bribe negotiation with a businessman.

In the tape, Marinho receives and puts in his pocket R$3,000 (about 1,259 USD) in cash. He insinuates that the scheme is commanded by deputy Roberto Jefferson. The recording was aired by the major Brazilian television stations.

A group of deputies mobilized to create a special investigation congress commission in order to investigate the denunciations. The Brazilian government tried to prevent the creation of the Congress' special commission convincing some deputies not to endorse the Congress investigations commission creation, however it failed. Now the government is trying to control how the special commissions works.

<h2>Other cases</h2>
<h3>Bingo's scandal</h3>
 &lt;span style="display:none"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
Waldomiro Diniz, former adviser to the government of President Lula, is accused of negotiating with "bicheiros" (illegal gambling enterprises), traffic of influences and extortions of money for Workers' Party (PT) electoral campaigns. The case was known in 2004 after a businessman revealed a tape exposing Diniz. The Brazilian magazine &lt;a href="w%3AEpoca"&gt;Epoca&lt;/a&gt; published a history on the case in February, 2004.

The recorded audio tape by the businessman Carlos Augusto Ramos, known as Carlinhos Cachoeira, shows him supposedly being extorted by Waldomiro Diniz. The tape's authenticity has been verified by experts and it was aired by the major Brazilian television stations.

Waldomiro was an adviser of the Ministry of Civilian Household, directed by the Minister José Dirceu, and president of ♡❤Loterj♡❤ (which administers the lotteries of the state of the Rio de Janeiro) from February, 2001 until December, 2002.

<h3>Mystery in mayor's death</h3>
The ophthalmologist João Francisco Daniel, brother of the murdered Mayor Celso Daniel (PT) from &lt;a href="w%3ASanto%20Andr%C3%A9"&gt;Santo André&lt;/a&gt;, metropolitan area of &lt;a href="w%3ASao%20Paulo"&gt;São Paulo&lt;/a&gt;, said that the crime had political reasons.

According to him, some mayor's advisers were receiving bribes from businessman. The bribes were allegedly used to collect founds for the Worker's Party and for self-enrichment.

The Mayor Celso Daniel has been murdered in 2002 and until now the case has not been totally solved. At least six witnesses died in suspicious situations.

<h3>The Minister Romero Jucá</h3>
The Social Security Minister Romero Jucá has been accused of having offered seven non-existent farms as guarantee for a financing from the Banco of Amazonia, among other denunciations of misuse of public loans. The minister attributes the accusations to political adversaries.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley"&gt;University of California, Berkeley&lt;/a&gt; announced that one of its graduate students, Michael Park, rediscovered on May 24 the Mount Diablo buckwheat, a plant not sighted since &lt;a href="w%3A1936"&gt;1936&lt;/a&gt; and believed to have been extinct.
Found nearly 30 miles east of &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, Park [aged 35] identified the small pink flowering plant said to resemble baby's breath during a routine visit to the mountain. He is currently pursuing his doctorate in integrative biology. 

The significance of the find drew comparisons to the recent discovery of the &lt;a href="w%3AIvory-billed%20woodpecker"&gt;Ivory-billed woodpecker&lt;/a&gt; in Arkansas earlier this year in April. The exact location of the flowering plant is, for now, being kept secret. Several botanists have confirmed it along with the nearly dozen or so other plants.

The property is being preserved by the ♡❤Save Mount Diablo♡❤ conservation group operating in the &lt;a href="w%3AMount%20Diablo%20State%20Park"&gt;Mount Diablo State Park&lt;/a&gt;.

After a final piece of videotaped testimony from the accuser in the &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Jackson"&gt;Michael Jackson&lt;/a&gt; case, the defense rested on Friday.

The interview was taped by the &lt;a href="w%3ASanta%20Barbara%20County%2C%20California"&gt;Santa Barbara County&lt;/a&gt; Sheriff's Department on July 6, 2003. The contents of the tape mostly repeated earlier testimony given by the boy describing Michael Jackson's alleged acts of molestation. Judge Rodney S. Melville instructed the jurors "only to observe the demeanor, manner and attitude of the witness", and that the boy's "statements are not to be considered for the truth of the matter stated."

Closing arguments could begin as early as Wednesday.

&lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt; low fares airline, &lt;a href="w%3ARyanair"&gt;Ryanair&lt;/a&gt;, this week celebrated its 20th birthday. Having reached the milestone, the airline promptly used the opportunity, as always, to sell seats; launching a massive 200,000 seat sale at 99p/99c a seat.

The airline was founded in 1985 by the Irish businessman, Dr &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Ryan"&gt;Tony Ryan&lt;/a&gt;. It began its existence flying a small 15 seat aircraft between &lt;a href="w%3AWaterford"&gt;Waterford&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Gatwick"&gt;London Gatwick&lt;/a&gt; with the small aim of breaking the duopoly on London-Ireland flights, held at that time by &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Airways"&gt;British Airways&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAer%20Lingus"&gt;Aer Lingus&lt;/a&gt;. Today however, the airline now flies to over 200 European destinations with its fleet of 84 &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20737"&gt;Boeing 737's&lt;/a&gt; and is awaiting the arrival of a future 225 aircraft from &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing"&gt;Boeing&lt;/a&gt;.

The company today carries as much as 3m passengers a month (depending on the season) and has revealed it made a profit of €245m (USD$307,916,000) in the past year. Ryanair CEO &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20O%27Leary"&gt;Michael O'Leary&lt;/a&gt; has stated that the airline will carry over 70m passengers annually within five years. The notoriously eccentric &lt;a href="w%3AMullingar"&gt;Mullingar&lt;/a&gt; man went on to tell the press "The very fact that a Mickey Mouse Irish airline can start in a field in Waterford 20 years ago and in 20 years overtake the world's self-styled, self proclaimed favourite airline is testament to the almost unstoppable demand for low airfare travel around Europe."

To demonstrate the huge drop in airfares over the last year, the company claimed while the price of a Ryanair seat had dropped from £99.99 in 1985 to 99p today, the price of a pint of beer had trebled and the average house price in England had increased by 500%.

&lt;a href="w%3AEddie%20Albert"&gt;Eddie Albert&lt;/a&gt;, well-known for his role as back-to-nature attorney Oliver Douglas in the surrealistic '60's TV series "Green Acres," has died at the age of 99. 

Albert, who suffered from Alzheimer's disease in later years, succumbed to &lt;a href="w%3Apneumonia"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday at his California home. His son Edward Albert was by his side at the time.

Although he gained his greatest fame in "Green Acres," Albert had a long movie, TV, and stage career stretching back to the 1930s. His first role came in 1938, playing opposite &lt;a href="w%3ARonald%20Reagan"&gt;Ronald Reagan&lt;/a&gt; in the comedy "Brother Rat." He went on to co-star in such movies as "Roman Holiday" (1953), The Longest Day" (1962), and "The Longest Yard" (1974).

Mr. Albert was also a vigorous environmental and social activist, making many trips on behalf of UNICEF and helping found the Plaza de la Raza foundation in Los Angeles to assist poor Hispanic youth. He played a significant role in urging the US to ban &lt;a href="w%3ADDT"&gt;DDT&lt;/a&gt;, which it did in 1972, and was instrumental in starting &lt;a href="w%3AEarth%20Day"&gt;Earth Day&lt;/a&gt;.

Eddie Albert's most recent movie role was in 1995's "The Barefoot Executive."

A coalition of citizen groups will ask Congress to file a formal "Resolution of Inquiry", the first necessary legal step to determine whether U.S. President Bush has committed impeachable offenses. The request, written by Boston constitutional attorney John C. Bonifaz on behalf of the citizen groups, cites the &lt;a href="Secret%20Downing%20Street%20Memo%20leaked"&gt;Downing Street memo&lt;/a&gt; and issues surrounding the planning and execution of the Iraq war. The full text of the request is available &lt;a href="http%3A//rawstory.com/exclusives/alexandrovna/memo_bush_impeachable_offenses_526"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

The request was written on behalf of several groups, including:
<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="http%3A//www.veteransforpeace.org/"&gt;Veterans for Peace&lt;/a&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="http%3A//www.pdamerica.org/"&gt;Progressive Democrats of America (PDA)&lt;/a&gt;

BULLET::::- &lt;a href="http%3A//www.gsfp.org/"&gt;Gold Star Families for Peace&lt;/a&gt;

</ul>
And cites the possible grounds for impeachment:

Bonifaz says that the official minutes of a secret US-UK meeting were the impetus for the request. Those minutes were recently leaked to ♡❤The Sunday Times♡❤, and are popularly known as the "Downing Street memo" or alternatively the "smoking gun memo". In it, British intelligence MI-6 director Richard Dearlove said, ♡❤"Bush wanted to remove Saddam, through military action, justified by the conjunction of terrorism and WMD. ♡❤♡But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy.♡❤♡"♡❤

The phrase "the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy." has been the center of attention in reports and discussions surrounding the memo. It has received this attention because critics of the Iraq war believe that it reaffirms their fundamental criticisms: that Bush's decision to go to war was not based on the intelligence, but, rather, intelligence was used selectively and exaggerated, while debunking intelligence was forcefully suppressed, for the sole purpose of rallying consent for the war, and that this was all done deliberately.

Bonifaz wrote: ♡❤"The recent release of the Downing Street Memo provides new and compelling evidence that the President of the United States has been actively engaged in a conspiracy to deceive and mislead the United States Congress and the American people."♡❤

Some Republican congressmen who had voted for the war have since stated that they believe the war was a mistake. For example, Walter Jones, the coiner of the phrase "freedom fries", is now the most vociferous opponent on Capitol Hill. "If we were given misinformation intentionally by people in this administration, to commit the authority to send boys, and in some instances girls, to go into Iraq, that is wrong," he has stated, "Congress must be told the truth."

On May 26th, the group &lt;a href="http%3A//www.afterdowningstreet.org"&gt;AfterDowningStreet.org&lt;/a&gt; launched a campaign to Congress to investigate whether President Bush committed impeachable offenses relating to the Iraq war.

<h1>Los Angeles firefighters battle Mt. Washington blaze</h1>
♡❤♡, ♡❤♡
Saturday evening, at approximately 7:00 p.m. PST on &lt;a href="w%3AMt.%20Washington%2C%20Los%20Angeles%2C%20California"&gt;Mt. Washington&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%2C%20California"&gt;Los Angeles, California&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3Abrush%20fire"&gt;brush fire&lt;/a&gt; broke out on the southwestern side of the hill.

&lt;a href="w%3Afirefighter"&gt;Firefighters&lt;/a&gt; were on the scene by 8:30 p.m. with &lt;a href="w%3Afire%20truck"&gt;fire trucks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Aparamedic"&gt;paramedic units&lt;/a&gt;, surveillance &lt;a href="w%3Ahelicopter"&gt;helicopters&lt;/a&gt;, and water-equipped helicopters. Two fire trucks blasted water at the blaze from higher up on the mountain, while every minute or so, a water-equipped helicopter would swoop down over the flames and release its payload. At the top of the hill, there were five fire trucks and one paramedic unit; the three main entrances to the mountain were barricaded off by fire trucks. 

By approximately 9:15 p.m., the flame was entirely extinguished, thanks mainly to the water-equipped helicopters. Firefighters were offering bystanders bottles of &lt;a href="w%3Awater"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGatorade"&gt;Gatorade&lt;/a&gt; to help combat the effects of standing near an open flame.

This year's &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Military%20Academy"&gt;West Point&lt;/a&gt; class of U.S. Army cadets graduated on Sunday and were commissioned as &lt;a href="w%3ASecond%20Lieutenant"&gt;Second Lieutenants&lt;/a&gt;. Known as the "Class of 9/11", they joined West Point just weeks before the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack and decided to stay.

General &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Myers"&gt;Richard B. Myers&lt;/a&gt;, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that this class is "one of the few since the early days of the Vietnam War who came to West Point in peace time, saw the nation transition to war and chose to stay, knowing you would raise your right hand and take an oath and swear to defend the constitution of a nation that was still at war."

By coincidence, there are 911 students in the class. Within a year from now, about 70% of them are expected to be serving in Iraq or Afghanistan.

A little-known mining company, Lapp Plats, has become the first company to list on &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Ireland's&lt;/a&gt; newly created &lt;a href="w%3AIrish%20Enterprise%20Exchange"&gt;Irish Enterprise Exchange&lt;/a&gt; (IEX). The firm has also applied to be listed on &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London's&lt;/a&gt; flourishing &lt;a href="w%3AAlternative%20Investment%20Market"&gt;Alternative Investment Market&lt;/a&gt; (AIM).

Lapp Plats' admission to the exchange brings to nine the total number of firms listed on the IEX - the other eight were all previously listed on the Exploration Securities Market, which was the precursor to the IEX.

At present Lapp Plats is involved in platinum and nickel exploration; but intends to broaden its interests into to other areas such as minerals, other metals, oil and gas.

The first exit poll, just published, has shown that 55% of &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; voters have rejected the new proposed &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Constitution"&gt;European Constitution&lt;/a&gt;. The result which was quoted on French national TV confirms widespread speculation among political commentators that France would say no by a considerable margin - opinion polls before the vote showed 56% were against the constitution.

It is believed that a significant majority of Frances 42m eligible voters have exercised their right to vote. Turnout is thought to have exceeded 70%. Polling ended at the 55,000 polling stations across the country 8pm, except in &lt;a href="w%3AParis"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALyon"&gt;Lyon&lt;/a&gt; where voting finished at 10pm.

The ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACrazy%20Frog"&gt;Crazy Frog&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ ringtone, long marketed to children and teenagers was last week launched as a single - and promptly proved more popular than both &lt;a href="w%3AColdplay"&gt;Coldplay's&lt;/a&gt; comeback release, &lt;a href="w%3ASpeed%20of%20Sound%20%28single%29"&gt;Speed of Sound&lt;/a&gt; and last weeks number one by &lt;a href="w%3AOasis%20%28band%29"&gt;Oasis&lt;/a&gt;.

The song, if it can be called that, is a variation of the hugely popular ♡❤Crazy Frog♡❤ ringtone remixed with &lt;a href="w%3AAxel%20F"&gt;Axel F&lt;/a&gt; - the theme tune from the 1980s film &lt;a href="w%3ABeverly%20Hills%20Cop"&gt;Beverly Hills Cop&lt;/a&gt; which starred &lt;a href="w%3AEddie%20Murphy"&gt;Eddie Murphy&lt;/a&gt;.

The ♡❤Crazy Frog♡❤ ringtone has been marketed in &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt;, and throughout Europe, by &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; firm ♡❤Jamster!♡❤ It is primarily marketed by multiple TV adverts on music channels which are targeted at teenagers and kids.

In a result predicted by polls, a ♡❤♡54.87%♡❤♡ majority of &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; voters voted ♡❤non♡❤ in Sunday's &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Constitution"&gt;European Constitution&lt;/a&gt; referendum. Of France's 42 million eligible voters, over ♡❤♡70%♡❤♡ turned out at the 55 thousand polling stations across the country, which were open from 8:00 to 20:00 on Sunday (except in &lt;a href="w%3AParis"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALyon"&gt;Lyon&lt;/a&gt; where voting finished at 22:00, and French oversea possessions and other polling centers in the Americas, which voted on Saturday in order not to have them vote when the results are already known). A ♡❤♡70%♡❤♡ turnout is very large compared to Spain ♡❤♡42%♡❤♡.

The result comes as no surprise to European political commentators as opinion polls had consistently suggested that the "No" camp was on course for a strong victory. Indeed, the last opinion poll before the actual referendum suggested a 56% win for the "No" camp.

The treaty was supported by all 3 major political parties (center-left &lt;a href="w%3AFrench%20Socialist%20Party"&gt;PS&lt;/a&gt;, center-right &lt;a href="w%3AUnion%20pour%20un%20Mouvement%20Populaire"&gt;UMP&lt;/a&gt;, center-right &lt;a href="w%3AUnion%20pour%20la%20D%C3%A9mocratie%20Fran%C3%A7aise"&gt;UDF&lt;/a&gt;), though a significant minority of the PS, and some in the UMP, chose to oppose it.

It was opposed by the &lt;a href="w%3AFrench%20Communist%20Party"&gt;French Communist Party&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ATrotskyism"&gt;Trotskyite&lt;/a&gt; movements such as the &lt;a href="w%3ARevolutionary%20Communist%20League%20%28France%29"&gt;Revolutionary Communist League&lt;/a&gt;, other far-left movements such as the &lt;a href="w%3AParty%20of%20the%20Workers"&gt;Party of the Workers&lt;/a&gt;, parts of the Socialist party, parts of &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Greens%20%28France%29"&gt;The Greens&lt;/a&gt; some members of UMP, and the nationalist &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Front%20%28France%29"&gt;National Front&lt;/a&gt;.

According to polls, the vast majority of blue collar workers, farmers and other categories threatened by globalization and international concurrence voted against the treaty. The urban, better educated or richer population voted in favor.

Some supporters of the "No" camp have argued that the mainstream media was biased in favor of the "yes" cause, and this was supported by some analyses of times awarded by television to both camps. However, the "no" camp also waged an aggressive campaign, with the walls of major cities being plastered with posters linking the EU Constitution and the European Union to all kind of social ills, such as high unemployment.

<h2>Polls</h2>
According to polls collected by &lt;a href="http%3A//www.tns-sofres.com/"&gt;TNS-Sofres&lt;/a&gt;, the largest polling company in France, voters gave the following reasons for voting no:
<ul>
BULLET::::- 46% -- feared that unemployment would worsen under the constitution
BULLET::::- 40% -- were discontent with the current situation in France
BULLET::::- 35% -- believed a no would permit the constitution to be renegotiated
BULLET::::- 34% -- found the constitution too economically liberal and difficult to understand
BULLET::::- 19% -- thought the constitution threatened the identity of France
BULLET::::- 18% -- wanted to prevent the entry of Turkey to the EU
BULLET::::- 12% -- followed certain political leaders who asked them to vote no.

</ul>
Note, however, that such polls offer only a limited number of answers and may thus misrepresent the actual motives of the people.

<h2>Arguments of the "No" vote</h2>

Proponents of the "No" vote, both on the left and right, argued that the proposed constitution enshrined what they claim is an undemocratic Europe, with much of the responsibilities granted to a body of unelected political appointees, the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEuropean%20Commission"&gt;European Commission&lt;/a&gt; and not enough checks and balances. They also point out that it vests much legislative power in the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEuropean%20Council"&gt;European Council&lt;/a&gt;, representing the executives of the various countries; this is seen as a bad arrangement with respect to &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASeparation%20of%20powers"&gt;Separation of powers&lt;/a&gt;. While the treaty adds supplemental powers for the directly elected &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEuropean%20Parliament"&gt;European Parliament&lt;/a&gt;, many opponents, particularly on the left, consider that they are still insufficient in order to provide checks and balances.

Much criticism was directed at the length of the proposed Constitution. The real treaty submitted to French voters is about 80 pages long, which many argue is too long and complex for a constitution. It is followed by 100 pages of appendices, declarations and protocols, some of them dealing with matters such as oil refining in the Dutch West Indies or specific nuclear power plants in Eastern Europe.

Opponents of the treaty argue that the proposed constitution will largely hamstring the French government and prevent it from leading its own policies in matters as diverse as social services or foreign policy.

Much of the opposition was targeted at Part&amp;nbsp;III of the proposed constitution, which sets the policies of the European Union. Opponents point out that the constitutions of most countries, including France, do not specify policies explicitly, except for a limited number of fundamental rights, but rather are limited to specifying the core principles and procedures of how governmental institutions work. Part&amp;nbsp;III, they argued, sets in stone a number of economic and social choices, while these should be a matter of political choice depending on democratic votes.

Both left-wing and right-wing opponents consider that some of these policies, already applied and enforced by the European Union, are disastrous for France's economy and society as well as European's economy and society. One primary target is the free trade policies with countries having less expensive workforce and social protection, which, they argue, drive French workers out of work (2.7 million French people are out of work).

This was recently exemplified by the so-called "&lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABolkestein%20directive"&gt;Bolkestein directive&lt;/a&gt;", which would have enabled service providers in the European Union to work anywhere in the union according to the legislation and social practices of their own country, not of the country where they'd work: this was caricatured as the example of the "Polish plumber" coming to work for a meager fraction of what French plumbers demand.

Much is made of ♡❤délocalisations♡❤ &amp;mdash; that is, the transferring of industries and, now, services to countries with lower production costs, depriving French workers of jobs at a time when unemployment is high.

As a consequence, both left-wing and right-wing opponents of the treaty and of current and proposed European Union policies argue in favor of some sort of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aprotectionism"&gt;protectionism&lt;/a&gt;.

In the field of international relations, many opponents contend that the proposed constitution would make the European Union largely subservient to &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ANATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt;, an institution dominated by the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AUnited%20States%20of%20America"&gt;United States of America&lt;/a&gt;.

A factor in the opposition to the constitution is the recent enlargement of the European Union, a major move which was not approved by a referendum. Opponents consider that open border concurrence with much poorer economies is bad for French economy; many express uneasiness at subsidizing and collaborating with governments that they consider subservient to the interests of the United States, such as Poland's (Poland chose to buy warplanes from the United States after receiving some European Union subsidies, a movement which resulted in many questioning the financial and diplomatic priorities of their government).

Finally, many seized the occasion to express their discontent at France's political elite and to president &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AJacques%20Chirac"&gt;Jacques Chirac&lt;/a&gt; and Prime Minister &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AJean-Pierre%20Raffarin"&gt;Jean-Pierre Raffarin&lt;/a&gt;'s government. While unemployment had receded under the rule of center-left former prime minister &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ALionel%20Jospin"&gt;Lionel Jospin&lt;/a&gt;, it has climbed against under Raffarin's administration despite his and Chirac's promises.

<h3>Left-wing arguments</h3>
Much opposition was directed towards what many on the Left consider the "ultra-liberal" character of the Constitution: that is, they argue, the proposed constitution makes permanent economic policies which they consider disastrous for French society:
<ul>
BULLET::::- the destruction of public services, with forced scaling-down and privatization (some groups tied the closure of post offices to the European Union);
BULLET::::- the vesting of much power in the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEuropean%20Central%20Bank"&gt;European Central Bank&lt;/a&gt;, governed by political appointees, with the sole goal of ensuring the stability of the markets whereas, opponents argue, a major objective should be the reduction of unemployment
BULLET::::- the encouragement of fiscal and "social dumping", whereby companies relocate themselves to the countries with the lowest standards of social services.

</ul>
Left wing opponents, they say, want Europe, but another Europe, which, in their view, would put the concerns of common people before those of financial markets and the wealthy. They contend that free market capitalism, which they consider enforced by the constitution, destroys lives and benefits the financial establishment, but not the average worker. They argue that open trade and concurrence encourages unemployment in France.

They argue, bluntly, that the constitution is the constitution of right-winger Chirac and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AMEDEF"&gt;MEDEF&lt;/a&gt;, the union of larger French private employers. MEDEF, due to its current leader &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AErnest-Antoine%20Seilli%C3%A8re"&gt;Ernest-Antoine Seillière&lt;/a&gt;, is very unpopular among the left.

Left-wing opponents argued that the Charter of rights included in the constitution was largely indicative, not prescriptive. They questioned the say that other members of the union may have in matters such as the right to abortion and the separation of Church and State, which they consider threatened by certain governments from Catholic countries, which, during the negotiation of the treaties, had insisted on adding references to the Christian heritage of Europe.

Another argument from the left was that the Constitution called for member states to strengthen their military forces. Opponents argue that this would be wasteful spending, would result in an arm race with the United States, China and others, and would result in wars and more instability.

Many leaders of the opposition to the "No" also simply called for a blow to Chirac.

<h3>Right-wing arguments</h3>
Many right-wing opponents argue that &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ATurkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;, which has applied for European Union membership, should not become a member, and that acceptance of the Constitution would pave the way for this. They point out that the new Eastern European members, whose joining many of them opposed, were accepted without a referendum; they also point out that Turkey is for the most part not located in Europe, but in the Middle-East, and that it borders countries such as &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;.

In addition, many supporters of the right-wing are opposed to a union with countries whose culture they consider too far from France, and are concerned about unchecked immigration from these. They also consider that the direction the European Union is heading will only reinforce unchecked immigration from poor Muslim countries, which they think is bad socially and economically for Europe. This point of view is disputed by many economists, who point out that due to aging of France and other European countries increasing immigration is the only viable option for boosting the existing economies.

Such arguments are likely not to have much impact on many French voters. The results of this referendum, as well as those of the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AFrench%20presidential%20election%2C%202002"&gt;2002 presidential election&lt;/a&gt;, show some deep distrust of the population for the political class as well as for "experts". There is high skepticism against economists and politicians who promote what they consider to be necessary reforms, whereas despite those reforms unemployment has remained high and standards of living have lessened for many.

<h2>Arguments of the "YES" vote</h2>
Supporters of the proposed European Constitution contend that it is a marked improvement over preceding treaties governing the European Union. They point out that it gives increased powers to the directly elected &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Parliament"&gt;European Parliament&lt;/a&gt; compared to the politically appointed &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Commission"&gt;European Commission&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Council"&gt;European Council&lt;/a&gt;. They also point out that it gives a right of &lt;a href="w%3Apetition"&gt;petition&lt;/a&gt; to European citizens, which they contend is a marked democratic advance. Opponents point out that this right may be exercised only with strict conditions (1,000,000 signatures from a "significant" number of countries) and with uncertain consequences. Furthermore, they point out that the basic undemocratic handling and procedures followed for the legislative enactment of laws are kept in place, and that neither the EC or the counsel of ministers have been internally made more democratic.

Proponents of the constitution consider that these improvements make the European Union markedly more democratic than it was before, while opponents may be of the opinion that something which is better then extremely bad, is still no good, and consider a no-vote a chance to come up with something better. Some supporters of the constitution contend that certain European measures that many consider ill-advised (such as the &lt;a href="w%3ABolkestein%20directive"&gt;Bolkestein directive&lt;/a&gt; or the directive on &lt;a href="w%3Asoftware%20patents"&gt;software patents&lt;/a&gt;) would not have been adopted if the stronger checks and balances provided for by the constitution had been implemented, but there is little actual basis to support such a claim.

Part&amp;nbsp;II of the proposed European Constitution is a ♡❤Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union♡❤. This charter lists a number of &lt;a href="w%3Ahuman%20rights"&gt;human rights&lt;/a&gt;, such as the prohibition of &lt;a href="w%3Atorture"&gt;torture&lt;/a&gt;, the prohibition of the &lt;a href="w%3Adeath%20penalty"&gt;death penalty&lt;/a&gt;, etc., and reinstates that the Union follows the &lt;a href="w%3ACouncil%20of%20Europe"&gt;Council of Europe&lt;/a&gt;'s (COE) &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Convention%20on%20Human%20Rights"&gt;European Convention on Human Rights&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3Ajurisprudence"&gt;jurisprudence&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Court%20of%20Human%20Rights"&gt;European Court of Human Rights&lt;/a&gt; (ECHR). All members of the European Union must belong to the COE and accept ECHR jurisdiction. Proponents of the constitution consider that this reinstatement of human rights is of great import, especially with respect to recent new members, which may not have much of a tradition of democracy, rule of law and human rights.

Proponents of the constitution dispel the accusation that the constitution is ♡❤ultra-libéral♡❤ (i.e. supports unfettered free market and prohibits social policies in member countries). They contend that these dispositions are not new, and were already to be found in the 1957 &lt;a href="w%3ATreaty%20of%20Rome"&gt;Treaty of Rome&lt;/a&gt;. They point out that unbiased concurrence is a the heart of European policies since the beginnings of the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Economic%20Community"&gt;European Economic Community&lt;/a&gt;.

They contend that, for a large part, the proposed constitution is just the consolidation of the preceding treaties governing the European Union into a single document.

They admit out that the Constitution, like all works designed by a committee out of compromise, may be bulky. However, they point out, France cannot expect to force its choices on other countries. While some French parties may have preferred that the constitution contains more "social" dispositions, such social dispositions would be opposed by countries such as the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, and there is little hope that any renegotiation would get them accepted. French Citizens, they claim, should be ready to accept an imperfect text.

Some supporters say that refusing the constitution will diminish the clout of France in European institutions and may make it more difficult in the future to have its interests be taken into account at that level.

Some right-wing supporters of the treaty contend that the European Union is a necessary force in order to push what they consider to be necessary reforms upon France.

Supporters of the treaty point out that the question of the constitution is disconnected from that of the accession of Turkey. President Chirac has pledged that the accession of Turkey would be put to a referendum before French voters (the accession treaty of former Eastern Bloc countries was ratified by the French Parliament without a referendum).

Finally, supporters of the proposed Constitution point out that this referendum is about the ratification of a treaty, and is not a plebiscite on the actions of president &lt;a href="w%3AJacques%20Chirac"&gt;Jacques Chirac&lt;/a&gt; and prime minister &lt;a href="w%3AJean-Pierre%20Raffarin"&gt;Jean-Pierre Raffarin&lt;/a&gt;, both of which are deeply unpopular.

In what may possibly be the largest &lt;a href="w%3AGay%20Pride"&gt;Gay Pride&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APride%20parade"&gt;parade&lt;/a&gt; in the world, hundreds of thousands of people marched along the streets of &lt;a href="w%3AS%C3%A3o%20Paulo"&gt;São Paulo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; today in the &lt;a href="w%3AParada%20do%20Orgulho%20GLBT%20de%20S%C3%A3o%20Paulo"&gt;Parada do Orgulho GLBT de São Paulo&lt;/a&gt;. Many marchers were demanding the legalization of &lt;a href="w%3Asame-sex%20marriage"&gt;same-sex marriage&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AReligion%20in%20Brazil"&gt;Brazil is the largest Roman Catholic country on Earth&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="w%3ARoman%20Catholic%20Church"&gt;Roman Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt; has consistently opposed the legalization of same-sex marriage in the country. The &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Congress%20of%20Brazil"&gt;National Congress of Brazil&lt;/a&gt; has debated legalization for 10 years, and such civil marriages are currently only legal in &lt;a href="w%3ARio%20Grande%20do%20Sul"&gt;Rio Grande do Sul&lt;/a&gt;. The original bill was drafted by former mayor of São Paulo, Marta Suplicy. The proposed legislation, after being amended, is now in the hands of Roberto Jefferson. Protesters hope to collect a petition of 1.2 million signatures to present to the National Congress in November.

People carrying flags and banners, some dressed in lavish carnival costumes, walked and danced in the ninth annual Gay Pride parade, stretching for 3.5 kilometres along &lt;a href="w%3AAvenida%20Paulista"&gt;Avenida Paulista&lt;/a&gt;. Traffic was diverted throughout most of the city, and drinks and snacks vendors took advantage of the barriers across many streets. Prominent people joining the parade were the actor Sergio Mamberti, representing the Culture Minister Gilberto Gil, and senator Eduardo Suplicy.
Organizers stated that 2.5 million people attended, and police stated that there were 1.9 million &amp;mdash; figures which would make the event the largest of its kind in the world &amp;mdash; including 700,000 visitors from other cities and countries. This was an increase from 2004, when police stated that 1.5 million people attended.

The $54 fine incurred by the owners of a chicken in &lt;a href="w%3AJohannesburg%2C%20California"&gt;Johannesburg, California&lt;/a&gt;, has been thrown out of court.

The owners, Linc and Helena Moore, had been complaining to the local authorities about children riding bicycles in the middle of the road and their neighbours' dogs running around, and assert that as a consequence when their chicken escaped and wandered onto the road "it became a huge issue". They were fined $54 on March 26, 2005. 

Under the California state code, &lt;a href="w%3Alivestock"&gt;livestock&lt;/a&gt; is banned from highways, but not &lt;a href="w%3Adomestication"&gt;domestic animals&lt;/a&gt;. The fine was dismissed when Henry Mosier, the public defence lawyer for the couple, argued that the chicken was not livestock but a domesticated animal. The chicken also has an unalienable right to "get to the other side".

The &lt;a href="w%3AKern%20County"&gt;Kern County&lt;/a&gt; Sheriff's Department has denied the allegation that the couple were fined because of their complaints, and the couple are seeking legal assistance for filing harassment charges against the department.

<h1>UK and U.S. bombing raids against Iraq increased in 2002</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=UK%20and%20U.S.%20bombing%20raids%20against%20Iraq%20increased%20in%202002&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;br&gt; 

New information surfaced on Saturday, 28 May, that suggest that the US and UK increased air strikes against Iraq in mid 2002. The Ministry of Defence figures, provided in response to a question from Sir Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman, show that allied aircraft doubled the rate at which they were dropping bombs on Iraq beginning in May of 2002.

This apparent escalation in the number and intensity of air strikes was initiated prior to the passage of &lt;a href="w%3AUN%20Security%20Council%20Resolution%201441"&gt;UN Resolution 1441&lt;/a&gt; in November 2002 and prior to the &lt;a href="w%3AJoint%20Resolution%20to%20Authorize%20the%20Use%20of%20United%20States%20Armed%20Forces%20Against%20Iraq"&gt;US Congress authorizing the use of force against Iraq in October 2002&lt;/a&gt;. Critics claim that this was an attempt to provoke &lt;a href="w%3ASaddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt; or soften his military infrastructure in preparation for a more comprehensive military campaign, and that it reaffirms their assertions that the Bush administrations was determined to go to war long before the official decision was made.

In August 2002, allied commander Tommy Franks admitted that this operation was designed to "degrade" Iraqi air defences in the same way as the air attacks that began the 1991 Gulf war, but according to legal guidance appended to the &lt;a href="Secret%20Downing%20Street%20Memo%20leaked"&gt;Downing Street memo&lt;/a&gt; (dated 23 July 2002) the allied aircraft were only "entitled to use force in self-defence where such a use of force is a necessary and proportionate response to actual or imminent attack from Iraqi ground systems".

According to military documents shown to the Sunday Express in 2002, the Allies invaded Iraq from Turkey on August 8th, 2002, after an air strike on the 6th that took out a crucial air defence system.

Pentagon officials initially denied there had been any military action or incursion, but when challenged with specific military details a spokesman called back two hours later issuing the terse statement: "We can't comment on current or future operations."

The evidence seems to corroborate information in the Downing Street memo:

In light of these revelations, Representative John Conyers has sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfield. A draft of the letter is available &lt;a href="http%3A//rawstory.com/exclusives/byrne/conyers_downing_street_letter_rumsfeld_529"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

In Conyer's draft, he states:

She was first elected to the Cheadle constituency by the slim margin of 33 votes in the 2001 election. She was then re-elected just 24 days before her death with a greatly increased majority of 4020, in spite of not campaigning herself due to the illness.

She was a staunch supporter of a ban on smoking in enclosed public spaces. Acting as the party's health spokesman, she supported the Bath Liberal Democrats anti-smoking initiatives in the 2004 spring conference.

She is survived by her husband Clive Calton, who worked as her researcher at the &lt;a href="House%20of%20Commons%20%28UK%29"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt;, and her son and two daughters.

<h1>Dominique de Villepin to replace resigning French PM</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Dominique%20de%20Villepin%20to%20replace%20resigning%20French%20PM&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

President &lt;a href="Jacques%20Chirac"&gt;Jacques Chirac&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; has accepted the resignation of &lt;a href="w%3Aprime%20minister"&gt;prime minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJean-Pierre%20Raffarin"&gt;Jean-Pierre Raffarin&lt;/a&gt; and has named &lt;a href="Dominique%20de%20Villepin"&gt;Dominique de Villepin&lt;/a&gt; in his place.

The resignation of Mr. Raffarin comes shortly after the resounding refusal of the ratification of the treaty establishing the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Constitution"&gt;European Constitution&lt;/a&gt; in a referendum. (See ♡❤&lt;a href="France%20votes%20no%20in%20EU%20referendum"&gt;France votes no in EU referendum&lt;/a&gt;♡❤). While Mr. Raffarin was initially popular with the French citizens (polled at 60% of trust in 2002), he gradually lost support from the population, up to record levels; according to &lt;a href="http%3A//www.tns-sofres.com/etudes/pol/barofigmagsofres.htm"&gt;polls&lt;/a&gt;, only 22% of the population trust him (including only 2% who trust him strongly).

The prime minister has responsibility for the day-to-day running of the French government.

There are questions whether Mr. de Villepin, who has never held elected office and has ascended mostly as a Chirac aide, will be well-received by the population and by the parliamentary majority. His nomination was immediately criticized by left-wing politicians, as well as by the center-right &lt;a href="w%3AUnion%20for%20French%20Democracy"&gt;Union for French Democracy&lt;/a&gt;, a junior partner in the ruling coalition, as a continuation of the same failed policies; Mr. Villepin was himself criticized as being out-of-touch with respect of the daily needs of the population. The &lt;a href="w%3AUnion%20for%20a%20Popular%20Movement"&gt;Union for a Popular Movement&lt;/a&gt;, the party created for backing Chirac, has now rallied behind &lt;a href="w%3ANicolas%20Sarkozy"&gt;Nicolas Sarkozy&lt;/a&gt;, whose reciprocal distaste for Chirac and Villepin is well-published.

Jacques Chirac announced that Nicolas Sarkozy would be Minister of State (a honorific rank) in the government; it is yet unknown what his attributions will be, but it is rumored that he will become &lt;a href="w%3AMinister%20of%20the%20Interior%20%28France%29"&gt;Minister of the Interior&lt;/a&gt;, a position whose main function is law enforcement and which he also held from 2002 to 2004. According to &lt;a href="http%3A//www.tns-sofres.com/etudes/pol/barofigmagsofres.htm"&gt;polls&lt;/a&gt;, Mr. Sarkozy is France's most popular politician. It is also well-known that Mr. Sarkozy and Mr. de Villepin see each other as a hostile competitor, particularly in the perspective of the 2007 presidential election.

In a press conference held at 13:00 UTC on Tuesday, &lt;a href="Bob%20Geldof"&gt;Bob Geldof&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AElton%20John"&gt;Elton John&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AHarvey%20Goldsmith"&gt;Harvey Goldsmith&lt;/a&gt; announced ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALive%208"&gt;Live 8&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, a set of simultaneous free concerts to be held in &lt;a href="w%3APhiladelphia"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AParis"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARome"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ABerlin"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt; on July 2, 2005, to raise awareness of &lt;a href="w%3AMake%20Poverty%20History"&gt;Make Poverty History&lt;/a&gt;, a campaign to get the richest nations to cancel debt and increase aid to developing countries. The concerts are scheduled to occur just before the &lt;a href="w%3AG8%20Summit"&gt;G8 Summit&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AGleneagles"&gt;Gleneagles&lt;/a&gt;, Scotland, from July 6 to July 8.

"20 years ago, at the time of the original &lt;a href="w%3ALive%20Aid"&gt;Live Aid&lt;/a&gt; concert, I was a self-obsessed drug addict.", began Elton John. "I've grown up since". He then described the aim of the concerts to raise awareness in the richest countries of the world of the plights of the poorest, and how his work on global &lt;a href="w%3AAIDS"&gt;AIDS&lt;/a&gt; awareness had impressed upon him the lack of awareness and ignorance that exists. "The Prime Minister of South Africa thinks that AIDS is something that is caused by poverty. I wish!"

Bob Geldof thanked the corporations who had already come forward to sponsor the event, including the &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAOL"&gt;AOL&lt;/a&gt;. In mentioning AOL he said that "20 years ago, almost nobody had a mobile 'phone", hinting at the possibility of AOL broadcasting the concerts to mobile telephones. Geldof also thanked The &lt;a href="w%3APrince%27s%20Trust"&gt;Prince's Trust&lt;/a&gt;, which had already booked &lt;a href="w%3AHyde%20Park%2C%20London"&gt;Hyde Park&lt;/a&gt; for July 2, for stepping aside in favour of Live 8.

<h1>Ryanair profits jump 19% to €268.9m</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Ryanair%20profits%20jump%2019%25%20to%20%E2%82%AC268.9m&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;br&gt;

&lt;a href="w%3ARyanair"&gt;Ryanair&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt; low fares airline, which last week celebrated twenty years in business, has reported a 19% increase in profits. The airline, which operates over 200 routes, revealed in its annual results that after tax profits had increased to €268.9m (US $332 million), comfortably beating the median analyst forecast of €248m ($306 million).

Group revenue rose by 24% to a record €1.34bn ($1.66 billion), on the back of a 19% rise in passenger numbers to 27.6m ($34.1 million). By 10:30am UTC, Ryanair shares had risen by 4.48% to €6.53 ($8.06) ( on the &lt;a href="w%3AIrish%20Stock%20Exchange"&gt;Irish Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt; (ISE), having hit €6.66 ($8.22) earlier in the morning - briefly valuing Ryanair above the €5bn ($6 billion) mark.

Despite the increase in profits, the firm told investors that the increased cost of fuel posed a serious threat for the future, however Ryanair has hedged 75% of next winters fuel needs at €38 ($47) a barrel. CEO &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20O%27Leary"&gt;Michael O'Leary&lt;/a&gt;, told the media in relation to fuel costs, "Our outlook for the coming 12 months is more positive than it was this time last year"..."Clearly fuel costs remain high, and the market is volatile." He also reiterated that Ryanair would not impose fuel surcharges on customers.

Ryanair's 2004 record profit is larger than that of &lt;a href="w%3AEasyjet"&gt;Easyjet&lt;/a&gt; ($74m), &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Airways"&gt;British Airways&lt;/a&gt; ($240m), and even its role model &lt;a href="w%3ASouthwest%20Airlines"&gt;Southwest Airlines&lt;/a&gt; ($313m). The fact that it made €248m on turnover of just €1.34bn makes it by some margin the world's most profitable major airline. One of the key methods of keeping costs to a minimum at Ryanair is by using less staff to carry more passengers, in comparison to its main competitors:

</ul>
</ul>
Ryanair has a stated aim of raising its passenger numbers to above 70m within five years time, making it Europe's largest airline. The &lt;a href="w%3ADublin"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt;-based airline currently is awaiting delivery of 200 new planes from &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing"&gt;Boeing&lt;/a&gt; which it hopes to use to achieve this ambitious aim and to replace its older aircraft.

People all over the &lt;a href="w%3ANetherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; are voting today in a referendum on the &lt;a href="w%3AEU%20constitution"&gt;EU constitution&lt;/a&gt;. This the first national referendum for two hundred years and it is non-binding. Though most major political parties have stated they will abide by the referendum if the outcome is sufficiently clear and a large enough percentage of the voters have actually voted.
The question put to voters will be:

All the main political parties have asked for a ♡❤♡♡❤voor♡❤♡♡❤ (for, or yes) vote. However polls have been saying that two-thirds of the people will be voting ♡❤♡♡❤tegen♡❤♡♡❤ (against, or no).

One reason for people to vote no is the expansion of the European Union with large countries like Turkey, which they fear will cause less influence for the smaller countries. The view of an European super state in which the Netherlands would loose its own identity is another reason for voting no. Some of the no voters do this to show they don't agree with the current political situation and the supposed risen prices since the introduction of the euro.

As of 14:00 CET, 9% more voters had turned up for the referendum than for the European elections.
<h3>Exit poll</h3>
21:25 CET: According to a Interview/NSS-NOS exit-poll, 63% have voted against the EU constitution, while 37% voted for.

Media group, &lt;a href="w%3AScottish%20Radio%20Holdings"&gt;Scottish Radio Holdings&lt;/a&gt; (SRH), has reached an agreement to purchase &lt;a href="w%3ACounty%20Donegal"&gt;Donegal's&lt;/a&gt; popular Highland Radio for around €7 million (USD $8.6 million). The &lt;a href="w%3ABroadcasting%20Commission%20of%20Ireland"&gt;Broadcasting Commission of Ireland&lt;/a&gt; has approved the deal in principle; but both the Competition Authority and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment still are entitled to block the deal.

Highland Radio, which broadcasts in north Donegal, &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, first hit the airwaves in 1990. It is based in &lt;a href="w%3ALetterkenny"&gt;Letterkenny&lt;/a&gt;. SRH is a major player in the Irish media market; already owning both &lt;a href="w%3AToday%20FM"&gt;Today FM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AFM104"&gt;FM104&lt;/a&gt;. Apart from operating radio stations, SRH is also a major player in the weekly newspaper market in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; and Ireland, owning 45 titles.

Mark Felt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a former associate director of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; during the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANixon%20Administration"&gt;Nixon Administration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , was the anonymous informer called &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADeep%20Throat%20%28Watergate%29"&gt;"Deep Throat"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . "Deep Throat" helped journalists &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Woodward"&gt;Bob Woodward&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACarl%20Bernstein"&gt;Carl Bernstein&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; bring down then-president &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Nixon"&gt;Richard Milhous Nixon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; through the exposure of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWatergate%20scandal"&gt;Watergate scandal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Previously bound by a pledge not to reveal "Deep Throat's" identity until after his death, Woodward and Bernstein at first refused to confirm the ♡❤Vanity Fair♡❤ report. However, in a story posted late today on the ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Washington%20Post"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ website, they verified that Felt was "Deep Throat."

However, one of Richard Nixon's biographers, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJonathan%20Aitken"&gt;Jonathan Aitken&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , believes that at least one of "Deep Throat's" tips could not have been known by Felt. The ♡❤Post♡❤ first reported on the famous 18 1/2 minute gap in a crucial tape at a time when only six people were aware of its existence -- none of them Felt. This raises the possibility that "Deep Throat," though mainly based on Felt, may be a composite character.

Felt has been mentioned as a leading candidate for "Deep Throat" by many that have tried to solve the mystery. An article published in the ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Journalism%20Review"&gt;American Journalism Review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ last fall claimed Carl Bernstein's son once exposed Felt as the mysterious informer. But until now, Felt, Woodward, Bernstein and the ♡❤Post's♡❤ former editor &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABenjamin%20C.%20Bradlee"&gt;Ben Bradlee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have all denied it.

Felt, 91, has reportedly been in poor health in recent years. His family says Felt admits to being the source and described him as feeling proud of his role in history and having "a big grin" when told of the ♡❤Vanity Fair♡❤ article.

The 23-year-old &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; delegate &lt;a href="w%3ANatalie%20Glebova"&gt;Natalie Glevoba&lt;/a&gt; was elected on Tuesday morning as the new &lt;a href="w%3AMiss%20Universe"&gt;Miss Universe&lt;/a&gt;, in a ceremony held at Bangkok's Impact Arena.

Glevoba is a professional model, height 1.79 m (5'11"), who received her Bachelor of Commerce in Information Technology Management and Marketing at &lt;a href="w%3ARyerson%20University"&gt;Ryerson University&lt;/a&gt;. Born in &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, she emigrated to &lt;a href="w%3Aes%3AToronto"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt; at the age of 11. She beat four Latin American delegates in semifinals: Cynthia Olavarria (&lt;a href="w%3APuerto%20Rico"&gt;Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt;), Renata Soñe (&lt;a href="w%3ADominican%20Republic"&gt;Dominican Republic&lt;/a&gt;), Laura Elizondo (&lt;a href="w%3AMexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;) and Mónica Spear (&lt;a href="w%3AVenezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;), as well as another 75 delegates from the same number of countries.

Chananporn Rosjan, from Thailand, won the Best Costume Award, while Gionna Cabrera, from Philippines, was chosen as Miss Photogenic and Tricia Homer, &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Virgin%20Islands"&gt;US Virgin Islands&lt;/a&gt; delegate, became Miss Congeniality.

&lt;a href="w%3ABilly%20Bush"&gt;Billy Bush&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANancy%20O%27Dell"&gt;Nancy O'Dell&lt;/a&gt; co-hosted the ceremony.

Glebova received the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.mikimoto.com/"&gt;Mikimoto&lt;/a&gt; crown, valued in 250,000 dollars, from &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJennifer%20Hawkins"&gt;Jennifer Hawkins&lt;/a&gt;, Miss Universe 2004. Besides, Natalie will live in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; for one year, in one of the &lt;a href="w%3ATrump%20Tower"&gt;Trump Towers&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href="http%3A//www.missuniverse.com/mainevent/prizes-main.html"&gt;other several prizes&lt;/a&gt;. The first time a Canadian was elected Miss Universe was in 1982, when &lt;a href="w%3AKaren%20Baldwin"&gt;Karen Baldwin&lt;/a&gt; won the pageant.

&lt;a href="w%3AColombia"&gt;Colombian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Afashion%20designer"&gt;designer&lt;/a&gt; Miguel De La Torre, who designed Glebova's wardrobe, declared that ♡❤"Canadian beauty contestants have always been quite classical. It's the first time a Latin designer is chosen. (...) At the very first days, Natalie was quite low-key, because being too noticed is not good. To be with her is the best thing has ever happened in my professional life. Furthermore, to come here for the first time with two delegates♡❤ (Glebova and Daniela Clerk from &lt;a href="w%3Aes%3ANicaragua"&gt;Nicaragua&lt;/a&gt;) ♡❤and two gown dresses was a dream come true"♡❤.

Glebova visited Colombia in April 2004 in order to take part in ♡❤Miss Maja World♡❤ pageant, held in the northern town of Corozal, Sucre, where she was the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.pageantopolis.com/international/maja_1991.htm"&gt;second runner-up&lt;/a&gt;, and went back there a few months ago to try the dresses designed by De La Torre. The Colombian designer has never participated at his country's national beauty pageant.

Thailand's prime minister &lt;a href="w%3AThaksin%20Shinawatra"&gt;Thaksin Shinawatra&lt;/a&gt; said the pageant was very positive for his country's tourism reactivation, after the &lt;a href="w%3A2004%20Indian%20Ocean%20earthquake"&gt;tsunami tragedy&lt;/a&gt;. Thailand spent 6.5 million dollars in the pageant and used locations at Phi-Phi and Phuket beaches for the previous footages with delegates.

<h1>U.S. Supreme Court overturns Arthur Andersen conviction</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=U.S.%20Supreme%20Court%20overturns%20Arthur%20Andersen%20conviction&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3ASupreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;U.S. Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday overturned a &lt;a href="w%3Awitness%20tampering"&gt;witness tampering&lt;/a&gt; conviction against &lt;a href="w%3Aaccounting"&gt;accounting&lt;/a&gt; firm &lt;a href="w%3AArthur%20Andersen"&gt;Arthur Andersen LLP&lt;/a&gt; for destroying documents related to now-bankrupt energy giant &lt;a href="w%3AEnron"&gt;Enron Corp.&lt;/a&gt; The verdict virtually put Andersen, once one of the largest accounting firms in the world and the fifth-largest in the United States, out of business.

In a unanimous opinion written by &lt;a href="w%3AChief%20Justice%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;Chief Justice&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AWilliam%20Rehnquist"&gt;William Rehnquist&lt;/a&gt;, the court threw out the verdict due to serious flaws in the jury instructions. The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Fifth%20Circuit"&gt;Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals&lt;/a&gt; had upheld Andersen's &lt;a href="w%3AJune%2015"&gt;June 15&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3A2002"&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt; conviction in &lt;a href="w%3AHouston"&gt;Houston&lt;/a&gt;. 

In the court's view, the instructions allowed the jury to convict Andersen without proving that the firm knew it broke the law or that there was a link to any official proceeding that prohibited the destruction of documents. "The jury instructions at issue simply failed to convey the requisite consciousness of wrongdoing," Rehnquist wrote. "Indeed, it is striking how little culpability the instructions required." Rehnquist's opinion also expressed grave skepticism at the government's definition of "corrupt persuasion"--persuasion with an improper purpose even without knowing an act is unlawful. "Only persons conscious of wrongdoing can be said to 'knowingly corruptly persuade,' " he wrote. 

The ruling came very quickly, as oral arguments in the case had taken place on &lt;a href="w%3AApril%2027"&gt;April 27&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice"&gt;Justice Department&lt;/a&gt; attorneys claimed Andersen employees were instructed "undertake an unprecedented campaign of document destruction" in order to impede a &lt;a href="w%3ASecurities%20and%20Exchange%20Commission"&gt;Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt; investigation into Enron's conduct. Deputy Solicitor General David Dreeben likened Andersen's behavior to "shredding its smoking guns."

However, Maureen Mahoney, arguing for Andersen, countered that the employees involved merely followed the company's policy on destroying unneeded documents, and that the shredding occurred before Andersen received a subpoena on &lt;a href="w%3ANovember%208"&gt;November 8&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3A2001"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt;. She also claimed that under the government's legal definition of "corrupt persuasion," acquittal was virtually impossible.

The justices seemed to indicate which way they were leaning very early in oral arguments, as they peppered the government lawyers with hostile remarks. 

Justice &lt;a href="w%3AAntonin%20Scalia"&gt;Antonin Scalia&lt;/a&gt; called the government's theory of prosecution "weird." Justice &lt;a href="w%3ASandra%20Day%20O%27Connor"&gt;Sandra Day O'Connor&lt;/a&gt; was particularly troubled by the trouble the jury initially had sifting the evidence. "If this thing is so confusing," she asked, "how is a businessperson supposed to know? How is a lawyer supposed to know?"

Andersen's appeal was backed by the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. In a friend-of-the-court brief, the association claimed that the government's broad definition of "corrupt persuasion" put defense lawyers at risk for prosecution simply for advising clients of their rights to assert legal privileges or review document retention policies.

Despite the ruling, which returns the case to the Fifth Circuit, it is highly unlikely Andersen will ever return as a viable business. It lost nearly all of its clients after its indictment, and was forced to shut down its American accounting practice due to federal laws that forbid convicted felons from auditing public companies. The firm still faces more than 100 civil suits related to its audits of Enron and other companies. Once 28,000 employees strong, the &lt;a href="w%3AChicago"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;-based Andersen is now down to around 200 employees who are largely occupied with handling the civil suits and other details of winding down the partnership.

A progressive &lt;a href="w%3Ablog"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;, Democrats.com, is offering a $1,000 reward to anyone who can get United States president &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; to answer a question about pre-&lt;a href="w%3A2003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq"&gt;Iraq war&lt;/a&gt; intelligence. The contest comes after Bush has declined for a full month to answer any questions about a leaked secret &lt;a href="w%3ABritain"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; memo, which states, in reference to the Bush administration, that "the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy". Neither the US or UK government are disputing the document's accuracy. The $1,000 question is:

The contest will also reward anyone who asks the question to Mr. Bush with $100 dollars (video evidence is required). The reward money was generated from small donations to the website.

The contest comes during renewed criticism and pressure on the administration from citizens, members of congress, retired politicians, and constitutional lawyers, generated from the recent leak of the minutes and other British documents.

Earlier this month, &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; spokesman &lt;a href="w%3AScott%20McClellan"&gt;Scott McClellan&lt;/a&gt; told reporters that the White House saw "no need" to respond to a letter from Congress asking questions about the memo. He also stated that "If anyone wants to know how the intelligence was used by the administration, all they have to do is go back and look at all the public comments over the course of the lead-up to the war in Iraq, and that’s all very public information. Everybody who was there could see how we used that intelligence."

One of the pre-war claims used by the Bush administration to justify the war was that Iraq possessed "weapons of mass destruction". After a thorough search, none were found. Senators on the Senate Intelligence Committee consider three possible causes for the apparent falsity of this claim:

<ul>
BULLET::::- The WMD's were moved sometime between the war and the search for them.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- The intelligence produced by the CIA community was bad.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- The intelligence was satisfactory but was mis-handled by the Administration.

</ul>
The last of these possibilities has not been formally investigated by the committee.

<h1>Brazilian Minister of Culture says that he smoked marijuana until the age of 50</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Brazilian%20Minister%20of%20Culture%20says%20that%20he%20smoked%20marijuana%20until%20the%20age%20of%2050&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The Brazilian Minister of Culture &lt;a href="w%3AGilberto%20Gil"&gt;Gilberto Gil&lt;/a&gt;, aged 62, said that he smoked &lt;a href="w%3Amarijuana"&gt;marijuana&lt;/a&gt; until he was 50. In addition he defended the &lt;a href="w%3ALegal%20issues%20of%20cannabis"&gt;decriminalization&lt;/a&gt; of drug's consumption.

Gil took part in a press conference with journalists of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AFolha%20de%20S%C3%A3o%20Paulo"&gt;Folha de São Paulo&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ on Monday (May, 30). During the interview the Brazilian minister asked:"Why should [drugs] be forbidden?" He added that the drugs problem should be handled as a matter of public health. Gil had already defended the idea of decriminalization during a interview with Brazilian magazine &lt;a href="w%3AVeja"&gt;Veja&lt;/a&gt;.

Gilberto Gil, and the drummer Chiquinho Azevedo, were arrested in 1976 in &lt;a href="w%3AFlorian%C3%B3polis"&gt;Florianópolis&lt;/a&gt; because they were carrying marijuana.

There is no consensus on decriminalization among Brazilians. Some people, like this Brazilian &lt;a href="http%3A//www.antidrogas.org.br/"&gt;Anti-drugs website&lt;/a&gt;, believe that &lt;a href="w%3Apsychoactive%20drug"&gt;psychoactive drugs&lt;/a&gt; are dangerous and can lead to health problems, including &lt;a href="w%3Achemical%20dependence"&gt;chemical dependence&lt;/a&gt;.

The end result says that 61.6% of the &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt; people vote ♡❤♡♡❤tegen♡❤♡♡❤ (against) the &lt;a href="European%20Constitution"&gt;European Constitution&lt;/a&gt;, while 38.4% voted ♡❤♡♡❤voor♡❤♡♡❤ (for) the Constitution. Turnout was unexpectedly high, at 62.8%, more than the last three elections. The 'no' vote follows a similar vote in &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; last week that lead to the resignation of the prime minister &lt;a href="Jean-Pierre%20Raffarin"&gt;Jean-Pierre Raffarin&lt;/a&gt;.

As in France, both the government and the parliament was highly pro-treaty, with Dutch Prime Minister, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJan%20Peter%20Balkenende"&gt;Jan Peter Balkenende&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , pleading over the past few days with voters not to be influenced by the French 'No' vote. While the citizenship's vote is legally non-binding, Mr. Balkenende and the Dutch parliament have said they will support it. 

The major reasons for the 'no' vote appear to be worry over the rapid expansion of the EU, loss of a national identity, distrust as a result of the inflation (allegedly a result of the Euro) and a lack of democracy. Other motivations include unhappiness with the government and &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;'s candidate accession to the European Union.

<h1>Samsung's 4 Gigabit flash memory begins mass production</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Samsung%27s%204%20Gigabit%20flash%20memory%20begins%20mass%20production&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;n electronics giant &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASamsung"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has begun mass production of a new 4 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Agigabit"&gt;gigabit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aflash%20memory"&gt;flash memory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . This is twice the size of almost all the biggest &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Asolid%20state"&gt;solid state&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; memory devices currently available.

The firm is using a new 70-&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ananometer"&gt;nanometer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; process which enables it to produce the smallest cell on the market, enabling a far higher density than competitors. The device can write data at 16-&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Amegabytes"&gt;megabytes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; per second, twice as fast as a 90nm 2Gb device.

Possible applications of the new memory will most likely be as a component in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMP3%20players"&gt;MP3 players&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , top end mobile phones, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUSB%20memory%20stick"&gt;USB memory sticks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Adigital%20camera"&gt;digital cameras&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and other portable devices.

The new form of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEEPROM"&gt;EEPROM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; memory writes and reads data faster than previous versions &amp;mdash; up to 16 megabytes per second. The storage of real-time high-definition video is feasible on the chips, according to Samsung. The company also believes their Flash-based disk drives could replace hard drives in laptops since they will work faster, quieter and cooler than drives currently in use.

&lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; Secretary General &lt;a href="w%3AKofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt; fired the first UN official in connection with the &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraqi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AOil-for-Food%20Programme"&gt;oil-for-food scandal&lt;/a&gt;. "After a thorough review of all aspects of the case, the Secretary General has decided that Mr. Joseph Stephanides be summarily dismissed for serious misconduct in accordance with UN staff regulations," relayed spokesman Stephane Dujarric. "Mr Stephanides was advised accordingly yesterday and separated from service with immediate effect. There is no allegation of any criminal act. This is a disciplinary action for a breach of staff rules regarding procurement."

The investigation concluded that Stephanides infringed on regulations by helping the &lt;a href="w%3ABritain"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; company, Lloyds Register Inspection Ltd., win a contract under the UN programme for Iraq. Mr. Stephanides acted as the head of the Security Council Affairs Division when he allegedly told the company how much to lower its price to be awarded a contract. He denies any wrong-doing and hired a lawyer to defend himself. Aged 59, Stephanides worked for the UN for 25 years, and was due to retire in September this year.

After a first food-for-oil interim report was released in February, Mr. Stephanides along with &lt;a href="w%3ABenon%20Sevan"&gt;Benon Sevan&lt;/a&gt; were suspended. Sevan, the former head of the oil-for-food programme for 6 years, was also accused of breach of procurement rules in the report co-written by &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20A.%20Volcker"&gt;Paul Volcker&lt;/a&gt;. However, disciplinary measures against Sevan will not be carried out because of his status of &lt;a href="w%3Adiplomatic%20immunity"&gt;diplomatic immunity&lt;/a&gt;.

A final report is scheduled for publication in three months which should further clarify whether Mr. Sevan received Iraqi oil allocations for a friend's company. In the meantime, he remains suspended from all UN duties, and is being given only a symbolic salary of one dollar a year.

A central and unanswered question, is whether either Stephanides or Sevan profited directly by their actions in executing and implementing the complex programme.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense"&gt;U.S. Defense Department&lt;/a&gt; has denied federal funding to two law schools because they do not allow military recruiters on campus. Now the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;U.S. House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; is putting forward a new law that would require the Secretary of Defense to compile a list of colleges and universities that don't allow the military to recruit on campus.

William Mitchell College of Law and &lt;a href="w%3AVermont%20Law%20School"&gt;Vermont Law School&lt;/a&gt; (not affiliated with the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Vermont"&gt;University of Vermont&lt;/a&gt;) have already been barred from federal funding for violating the Solomon amendment, a 10-year old law that "the armed forces cannot be denied access to students". Legislators recently passed a measure that would require the Secretary of Defense to provide a list of schools whose cooperation it is unsatisfied with.

Representative Cliff Sterns (R-FL) is pushing through the House an amendment that would toughen the Solomon amendment, a law which states "Any college that prohibits the U.S. military from establishing or operating an &lt;a href="w%3AReserve%20Officer%20Training%20Corps"&gt;ROTC&lt;/a&gt; unit on campus or denies military recruiters access to students is ineligible for federal funding." Sterns' amendment is part of the Defense Department Authorization Act.

Sterns claims that &lt;a href="w%3AYale%20University"&gt;Yale University&lt;/a&gt; is discriminating against military recruiters. Yale denies this. Rich Jacobs, a representative of Yale, in a prepared statement, said "Yale has sought to comply fully with the Solomon amendment as it applies to ROTC and Yale university." Yale gives ROTC a room on campus, but does not help arrange interviews. According to Yale's website, "The defense department's '&lt;a href="w%3ADon%27t%20ask%2C%20don%27t%20tell"&gt;Don't ask, don't tell&lt;/a&gt;' policy, which prevents openly [public] gays, lesbians, and bisexuals from serving in the military, violates the school's non-discrimination policy." The Defense Department has declined to sign the school's non-discriminatory policy. 

In the fall the &lt;a href="w%3ASupreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;U.S. Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; is lined up to hear a case involving several colleges and regarding military recruitment at universities.

<h1>Blog alliance forms over leaked Downing Street memo</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Blog%20alliance%20forms%20over%20leaked%20Downing%20Street%20memo&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
On May 30, 2005, in a "blogswarm", a massive blog alliance formed. The swarm was fueled by the leak of a secret British memo known as the "&lt;a href="w%3ADowning%20Street%20memo"&gt;Downing Street memo&lt;/a&gt;". &lt;a href="http%3A//www.newswriter.us/blogrolls.html"&gt;Hundreds of blogs&lt;/a&gt; formed into the "&lt;a href="http%3A//www.bigbrassblog.com/bba.html"&gt;Big Brass Alliance&lt;/a&gt;", almost overnight, and the alliance is still growing.

A blogswarm is when a large number of bloggers focus on an issue and spread information on it throughout the blogosphere quickly, causing the blogs to swiftly synchronize, much like a swarm of bees. In this particular blogswarm, titled by its patriots the "Big Brass Blogswarm", the blogs have aggregated about a central blog: The Big Brass Alliance.

The Big Brass Alliance is a collective of bloggers who support &lt;a href="http%3A//www.afterdowningstreet.org"&gt;AfterDowningStreet.org&lt;/a&gt;. The latest "blogroll" can be see &lt;a href="http%3A//rpc.blogrolling.com/display_raw.php%3Fr%3D7a8f60d82de9808f170d4fafe75caa03"&gt;here via PHP&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http%3A//rpc.blogrolling.com/rss.php%3Fr%3D7a8f60d82de9808f170d4fafe75caa03"&gt;in RSS XML&lt;/a&gt;. All the blogs will voluntarily post all correspondence from afterdowningstreet.org on their main page, and in general be coordinated by them. The current goals of the Big Brass Alliance are to:

<ul>
BULLET::::- Spread awareness of the memo. (Neither the US nor the UK government are disputing the accuracy of the memo.)
BULLET::::- Petition mainstream media to report on the contents of the memo as it pertains to the &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush Administration&lt;/a&gt;'s handling of pre-war intelligence, and the controversy surrounding it.
BULLET::::- Gather 250,000 signatures from citizens for a &lt;a href="http%3A//www.johnconyers.com"&gt;letter from Congress to the President of the United States&lt;/a&gt;, urging him to answer five questions regarding the memo, its contents, and the actions of the Administration.
BULLET::::- Urge people to personally ask the President a single question regarding the Administration's handling of pre-war intelligence and the sentence in the leaked memo: "But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy." (There is a &lt;a href="http%3A//www.democrats.com/bush-question1"&gt;$1,000 reward&lt;/a&gt; out for a clear answer.)
BULLET::::- Urge people to sign a &lt;a href="http%3A//www.democrats.com/peoplesemailnetwork/39."&gt;petition in support of a "Resolution of Inquiry"&lt;/a&gt; into President Bush's handling of pre-war intelligence.

</ul>
Within days of its inception, the Alliance delegated maintenance tasks to dedicated bloggers, created a mailing list and forum for news and coordination, and created a Yahoo group and chat channel for brainstorming.

References to "blogswarm" in blogs in its inception on May 31 can be see &lt;a href="http%3A//www.blogpulse.com/search%3Fquery%3Dblogswarm%26amp%3Bstart_date%3D20050531%26amp%3Bend_date%3D20050531"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The last blogswarm was on March 21, in response to the &lt;a href="w%3ATerri%20Schiavo"&gt;Terri Schiavo&lt;/a&gt; trial, but the one before that was much bigger. That blogswarm was on February 17, and it was fueled by an opinion article in the &lt;a href="w%3AWall%20Street%20Journal"&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt; by columnist Peggy Noonan, titled "&lt;a href="http%3A//www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/pnoonan/%3Fid%3D110006302"&gt;The Blogs Must Be Crazy&lt;/a&gt;". That blogswarm, however didn't generate a massive alliance like this one, and it wasn't focused on a political issue. "Spitbull" has a list of other blogswarms and their "fallout", that they call a &lt;a href="http%3A//spitbull.blogspot.com/2005/02/blogswarming-scoreboard.html"&gt;"blogswarming scorecard"&lt;/a&gt;.

200,000 people living around &lt;a href="w%3AHarare"&gt;Harare&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Zimbabwe"&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt; have been evicted from their homes, which have been targeted in a demolition programme by the government. Most have been forced to sleep out in the open while rental prices in the city have skyrocketed.

The operations have targeted at least six Harare suburbs: Hatcliff extension, Epworth, Dzivaresekwa, Glenorah, Glenview, Budriro and Mbare.

The official government newspaper, The Herald, says that 22,735 people have been arrested in the drive against "illegal structures, businesses and criminal activities". 

The Zimbabwe Human Rights Association (ZimRights) are pressing for the government for a six month waiting period to give residents time to make new housing arrangements. ZimRights director Munyaradzi Bidi told the IRIN news service: "About 200,000 people have been affected in the demolition drive &amp;mdash; and many of them have papers to prove that they were legal occupants with lease agreements".

&lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt; biotech firm &lt;a href="w%3A%C3%89lan"&gt;Élan&lt;/a&gt; has seen its shares plunge this morning after it revealed that a fourth patient taking its new &lt;a href="w%3Amultiple%20sclerosis"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; drug Tysabri had contracted a fatal brain disease.

Whilst US stock markets have not yet opened for business, &lt;a href="w%3AAthlone"&gt;Athlone&lt;/a&gt; based Élan has suffered a 22% drop on the &lt;a href="w%3AIrish%20Stock%20Exchange"&gt;Irish Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt; and a 21.5% drop on the &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Stock%20Exchange"&gt;London Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt;. That means that so far today the firms market value has dropped by over €400mm to €1.9bn. The firm was once valued at over €20bn before the failure of Tysabri and an accounting investigation.

Élan was once one of Ireland's biggest business success stories. Élan still employs over 2,000 people in Ireland and reported revenues of $464.0 million in 2004.

The &lt;a href="w%3AICANN"&gt;ICANN&lt;/a&gt; (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) responsible for managing &lt;a href="w%3Adomain%20names"&gt;domain names&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AIP%20address"&gt;IP addresses&lt;/a&gt;, approved a plan Wednesday to create a new &lt;a href="w%3Atop-level%20domain"&gt;top-level domain&lt;/a&gt; (TLD) with the &lt;a href="w%3A.xxx"&gt;.xxx&lt;/a&gt; extension. They are working with the domain registrar, ICM Registry, to make the domains available as early as fall or winter. ICM plans to sell registrations of .xxx domains for $60 a year.

The new TLD was one of ten recently under consideration. .jobs and .Travel have already been approved.

The .xxx domain is intended for use by &lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20pornography"&gt;adult pornographic/erotic web sites&lt;/a&gt;. The stated reason a new TLD has been approved is to protect children from pornographic sites; a &lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20filter"&gt;filter&lt;/a&gt; could simply block all .xxx pages.

The ICANN, established by the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Department%20of%20Commerce"&gt;U.S. Department of Commerce&lt;/a&gt; in 1998, is a non-profit corporation responsible for the technical coordination of the Internet through the assignment of domain names and IP addresses.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union"&gt;American Civil Liberties Union&lt;/a&gt; opposes the proposal since topics like homosexuality or birth control could be forced to use the domain, making them easily blockable by filters.

After its first appearance in the 3rd Division, Pavlos Melas Soccer Club finished in the 14th position and was relegated, despite its 2-1 victory over Doxa Dramas Football Club, with 36 points in 32 games. The team from &lt;a href="w%3AThessaloniki"&gt;Salonika&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGreece"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt; will be a serious contender for the championship in the 4th Division. Former &lt;a href="w%3AOlympiacos"&gt;Olympiacos SFC&lt;/a&gt; player &lt;a href="w%3AAlekos%20Tatsis"&gt;Alekos Tatsis&lt;/a&gt;, almost &lt;a href="w%3AAnderlecht"&gt;Anderlecht&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABelgium"&gt;Belgium's&lt;/a&gt; starlet, was released free by OSFC. Pavlos Melas was planning to sign him, but after the relegation, Tatsis probably won't join the "Greens".

Darwin's Ltd. opened a second location of their sandwich shop at &lt;a href="http%3A//maps.google.com/maps%3Fq%3D1613%2BCambridge%2BStreet%2C%2BCambridge%2C%2BMA%26amp%3Bspn%3D0.007070%2C0.008057%26amp%3Bt%3Dk%26amp%3Bhl%3Den"&gt;1613 Cambridge Street&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ACambridge%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;, in late May. It is situated across from Cambridge Rindge and Latin School. Previously limited to one location at &lt;a href="http%3A//maps.google.com/maps%3Fq%3D148%2BMount%2BAuburn%2BStreet%2C%2BCambridge%2C%2BMA%26amp%3Bll%3D42.374023%2C-71.125043%26amp%3Bspn%3D0.007070%2C0.008057%26amp%3Bt%3Dk%26amp%3Bhl%3Den"&gt;148 Mount Auburn Street&lt;/a&gt;, the second store seats approximately 30 people and sells sandwiches, coffee drinks, locally made pastries, as well as some produce and snack foods. The establishment also provides free wireless access through the WanderingWifi service. The shop plays music during the day; during this reporter's visit to the shop, selections played ranged from &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Bowie"&gt;David Bowie&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Strokes"&gt;The Strokes&lt;/a&gt;. The store is air-conditioned.

Key differences between the original store and the new one include the unification of the cafe and the sandwich line now behind one counter, handicap accessible restrooms, no beer or wine sold at location, and a lack of a loyal customer base. Although the recent months have been slow, business is expected to pick up with the return of Cambridge area students this autumn. 

While the original location of Darwin's was recently cited for lacking sneeze guards before the kitchen counter, according to the Cambridge Chronicle, the new Darwin's has acrylic sheets along the front of their sandwich counter. The original Darwin's has installed the sneeze guard at the kitchen counter the day following citation.

Newly named &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20France"&gt;Prime Minister of France&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Dominique%20de%20Villepin"&gt;Dominique de Villepin&lt;/a&gt; has had his cabinet accepted by &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20France"&gt;President of the Republic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Jacques%20Chirac"&gt;Jacques Chirac&lt;/a&gt;.

Head of the majority &lt;a href="w%3AUnion%20for%20a%20Popular%20Movement"&gt;Union for a Popular Movement&lt;/a&gt; (UMP) party, &lt;a href="Nicolas%20Sarkozy"&gt;Nicolas Sarkozy&lt;/a&gt;, comes as a second-in-command as &lt;a href="w%3AMinister%20of%20the%20Interior%20%28France%29"&gt;Minister of the Interior&lt;/a&gt;, with the honorific rank of Minister of State. The Ministry of the Interior is traditionally one of the most important positions in the cabinet, with that of Finances; the Minister of the Interior is in charge, notably, of &lt;a href="w%3Alaw%20enforcement"&gt;law enforcement&lt;/a&gt; and relationships with local governments. There is some uneasiness in having the head of a party in a position that is partly in charge of &lt;a href="w%3Agerrymandering"&gt;electoral redistrictings&lt;/a&gt;. Also, this arrangement creates a peculiar situation: it is public knowledge that Villepin and Sarkozy consider each other a dangerous political rival with respect to the 2007 presidential election, and they are widely said to loathe each other.

The cabinet was presented as a "restricted" cabinet. However, as many as 31 ministers, delegate ministers and secretaries of state were named; still, this is a reduction from the preceding 43. While the cabinet is for a large part copied from the preceding one, some ministers who had provoked controversy and animosity were removed or moved to another less risky position. &lt;a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Fillon"&gt;François Fillon&lt;/a&gt;, formerly &lt;a href="w%3AMinister%20of%20National%20Education%20%28France%29"&gt;Minister of National Education&lt;/a&gt;, whose plan for reforming public education was lambasted by members of his own party, including president of the National Assembly &lt;a href="w%3AJean-Louis%20Debr%C3%A9"&gt;Jean-Louis Debré&lt;/a&gt;, was ruled partly unconstitutional by the &lt;a href="w%3AConstitutional%20Council%20of%20France"&gt;Constitutional Council&lt;/a&gt;, and provoked widespread student protests and unrest in high schools, is no longer a minister. &lt;a href="w%3ADominique%20Perben"&gt;Dominique Perben&lt;/a&gt;, who pushed for controversial law which opponents allege curtail fundamental constitutional freedoms while &lt;a href="w%3AMinister%20of%20Justice%20%28France%29"&gt;Minister of Justice&lt;/a&gt;, was moved to the less sensitive position of Minister of Transportation and Equipment. It is also possible that the movement of &lt;a href="w%3ABrigitte%20Girardin"&gt;Brigitte Girardin&lt;/a&gt; from Minister for the Oversea (relationships with &lt;a href="w%3AFrench%20overseas%20departments%20and%20territories"&gt;French overseas departments and territories&lt;/a&gt;) to (international) Cooperation was motivated by the crisis that occurred in &lt;a href="w%3AFrench%20Polynesia"&gt;French Polynesia&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href="w%3AGaston%20Flosse"&gt;Gaston Flosse&lt;/a&gt; and his opponent &lt;a href="w%3AOscar%20Temaru"&gt;Oscar Temaru&lt;/a&gt;.

While the &lt;a href="w%3AUnion%20for%20French%20Democracy"&gt;Union for French Democracy&lt;/a&gt; (UDF) party, led by &lt;a href="w%3AFran%C3%A7ois%20Bayrou"&gt;François Bayrou&lt;/a&gt;, formally remains in the ruling coalition along with the UMP, it has decided that, because the new government would probably do more of the same policies, it would not participate in it. The only member of the government from UDF is &lt;a href="w%3AGilles%20de%20Robien"&gt;Gilles de Robien&lt;/a&gt;, as in the preceding government.

Previous head of government &lt;a href="w%3AJean-Pierre%20Raffarin"&gt;Jean-Pierre Raffarin&lt;/a&gt; had lost the confidence of the French, with polls putting him as low as 22% confidence. President Chirac's confidence among the citizenry is also a record low of 24%.

In a swing through South Coast, &lt;a href="w%3AFlorida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, former &lt;a href="w%3A2004%20presidential%20election"&gt;2004 presidential candidate&lt;/a&gt; Senator &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Kerry"&gt;John Kerry&lt;/a&gt; criticized the near silence of the U.S. mass media regarding the so-called "&lt;a href="w%3ADowning%20Street%20memo"&gt;Downing Street Memo&lt;/a&gt;". The Downing Street Memo is a leaked secret British document that details the minutes of a 2002 meeting between top-level British and American government officials. The memo states that &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; "was determined" to &lt;a href="w%3A2003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq"&gt;attack Iraq&lt;/a&gt; long before going to Congress with the matter, and that "the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy." The accuracy of the memo is not being disputed by either government. The memo caused an uproar in Great Britain and made a significant impact in the British national elections, but has gotten little attention in American news. Kerry said of the memo: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"When I go back [to Washington] on Monday, I am going to raise the issue. I think it's a stunning, unbelievably simple and understandable statement of the truth and a profoundly important document that raises stunning issues here at home. And it's amazing to me the way it escaped major media discussion. It's not being missed on the Internet, I can tell you that."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He questioned Americans' understanding of the war and the idea that criticism equals disloyalty, saying,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Do you think that Americans if they really understood it would feel that way knowing that on Election Day, 77 percent of Americans who voted for Bush believed that weapons of mass destruction had been found and 77 percent believe Saddam did 9/11? Is there a way for this to break through, ever?"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Representative &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Conyers"&gt;John Conyers&lt;/a&gt; has written to the President regarding the memo:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...a debate has raged in the United States over the last year and one half about whether the obviously flawed intelligence that falsely stated that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction was a mere 'failure' or the result of intentional manipulation to reach foreordained conclusions supporting the case for war. The memo appears to close the case on that issue stating that in the United States the intelligence and facts were being 'fixed' around the decision to go to war."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is a growing movement on the internet and in Congress for a "Resolution of Inquiry" into issues surrounding the planning and execution of the Iraq war, especially in regard to the Administration's handling of intelligence. &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Dean"&gt;John Dean&lt;/a&gt;, a key Watergate figure, wrote in a June 2003 column for findlaw.com, that, "To put it bluntly, if Bush has taken Congress and the nation into war based on bogus information, he is cooked... Manipulation or deliberate misuse of national security intelligence data, if proven, could be a 'high crime' under the Constitution's impeachment clause."

However, in practical terms impeachment in the U.S. Senate requires a 2/3 majority for conviction, which is unlikely given that 55 out of 100 Senators are Republican.

When asked about the Downing Street Memo on May 23, White House spokesman Scott McClellan said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"If anyone wants to know how the intelligence was used by the administration, all they have to do is go back and look at all the public comments over the course of the lead-up to the war in Iraq, and that's all very public information. Everybody who was there could see how we used that intelligence.

&lt;p&gt;"And in terms of the intelligence, it was wrong, and we are taking steps to correct that and make sure that in the future we have the best possible intelligence, because it's critical in this post-September 11th age, that the executive branch has the best intelligence possible."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt; low fares airline, &lt;a href="w%3ARyanair"&gt;Ryanair&lt;/a&gt;, has reported that passenger numbers for May 2005 are up 34%. This represented the largest increase in traffic for over a year, and comes after a string of good news for the airline during the week; most notably reporting record profits.

Ryanair carried 2.9 million passengers in May compared to 2.17 million in the same period last year. This was partly helped by an increase in the number of routes over the year. Ryanair has been aggressively adding routes from its new European base in &lt;a href="w%3AShannon"&gt;Shannon&lt;/a&gt; and throughout southern &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; over the past year. The airline now operates 12 routes from Shannon and over 50 from Spain.

Load factor also increased, from 81% to 82%, as did the percentage of tickets sold on the internet. Internet sales now account for 98% of total ticket sales, up from 97% in May 2004.

The airline, which operates over 200 routes, revealed after tax profits of €268.9m (US $332m) earlier this week and record revenue of €1.34bn ($1.66bn).

In the past several weeks, &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; has seen civil unrest in several major cities, ranging from peaceful student demonstrations to riots to apparent politically motivated assassinations. Tensions have been especially high in the past several days.

Major soccer victories have served as the spark for some demonstrations, while others seem to be a symptom of disputes regarding ballot issues in Iran's upcoming (June 17) elections. The &lt;a href="w%3AGuardian%20Council"&gt;Guardian Council&lt;/a&gt; which approves all political candidacies has cleared eight nominees, barring several popular candidates.

<h2>June 3</h2>
<ul>
BULLET::::- On the night of June 3, students at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Tehran"&gt;University of Tehran&lt;/a&gt; peacefully protested outside their dormitories against the exclusion of two candidates from ballots for the upcoming presidential elections.
BULLET::::- At the same time, fans in Tehran clashed with ♡❤Bassiji♡❤ militiamen (a component of the &lt;a href="w%3AIslamic%20Revolutionary%20Guards%20Corps"&gt;Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps&lt;/a&gt; after Iran's 1-0 soccer victory over fellow "&lt;a href="w%3AAxis%20of%20evil"&gt;Axis of Evil&lt;/a&gt;"-member &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;. Attendees had been warned against excessive jubilation, as the nation is supposed to be in mourning for the anniversary of the death of the Islamic Republic's founder, &lt;a href="w%3ARuhollah%20Khomeini"&gt;Grand Ayatollah Khomeini&lt;/a&gt;. Some young women were reportedly seen removing their veils and dancing in the street.
BULLET::::- Also on June 3, an Iranian exile organization reports that two plainclothes security police agents have been killed in the city of &lt;a href="w%3AIsfahan%20%28city%29"&gt;Isfahan&lt;/a&gt;, and there are reports of others being struck in hit-and-run motorbike attacks.
BULLET::::- Protests which began in late May continued at &lt;a href="w%3AAmir%20Kabir%20Technical%20University"&gt;Amir Kabir&lt;/a&gt;. Other protests in late May and early June occurring in Isfahan, &lt;a href="w%3AShiraz"&gt;Shiraz&lt;/a&gt; and other cities were broken up by ♡❤Bassiji♡❤; however, the students at Amir Kabir have apparently been too numerous to disperse.

</ul>
<h2>June 2</h2>
<ul>
BULLET::::- Two badly-burned bodies were found hogtied in the River Karoun at &lt;a href="w%3AAhwaz"&gt;Ahwaz&lt;/a&gt; in Southern Iran. The city in &lt;a href="w%3AKhuzestan%20Province"&gt;Khuzestan&lt;/a&gt; has been under martial law since widespread unrest last month.
BULLET::::- Students at came out to &lt;a href="w%3AKhoy"&gt;Khoy University&lt;/a&gt; protest Iran's mandatory female veil policy. The students shouted anti-regime slogans and called for election boycotts. Some of them initiated a hunger strike the previous day. The students were dispersed by ♡❤Herrassat♡❤ (university police), who were reportedly seen confiscating cameras, mobile picturephones and other recording devices. Several students were reportedly wounded in clashes with authorities.

</ul>
<h2>June 1</h2>
<ul>
BULLET::::- Students at the University of &lt;a href="w%3AIlam"&gt;Ilam&lt;/a&gt; disrupted a speech by presidential candidate Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, a former security forces chief. Several students were arrested.

On Friday, the U.S. military released the results of their investigation and confirmed that in 5 separate incidents, American guards at the &lt;a href="w%3AGuant%C3%A1namo%20Bay"&gt;Guantánamo Bay&lt;/a&gt; prison "mishandled" the &lt;a href="w%3AQur%27an"&gt;Islamic holy book&lt;/a&gt;. However, they stress that guards were usually "respectful" of the Qur'an.

One incident involved splashing a &lt;a href="w%3AQur%27an"&gt;Qur'an&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="w%3Aurine"&gt;urine&lt;/a&gt; by urinating near an air vent while others involved kicking, stepping on and writing in Qur'ans.

Brigadier-General Jay Hood, the commander of the jail, said that these incidents are the exception to the rule. In a statement issued late Friday, he said: "The inquiry ... revealed a consistent, documented policy of respectful handling of the Qur'an dating back almost two-and-a-half years."

Gen. Hood looked into the allegations, published and then retracted by &lt;a href="w%3ANewsweek"&gt;Newsweek&lt;/a&gt;, that American personnel flushed a Qur'an down a toilet. He said that the inquiry did not find any evidence supporting this particular allegation. "The inquiry found no credible evidence that a member of the Joint Task Force at Guantanamo Bay ever flushed a Qur'an down a toilet. This matter is considered closed."

The incidents reported are:

<ul>
BULLET::::- a guard kicking a prisoner's Qur'an;
BULLET::::- Qur'ans wetted by water balloons thrown by guards;
BULLET::::- a "two-word obscenity" written, in English, inside the cover of a Qur'an. Military officials state that it is equally possible that a guard wrote this in the prisoner's Qur'an or that the prisoner wrote this in his own Qur'an;
BULLET::::- a guard who urinated too close to an air vent, spraying a Qur'an with urine;
BULLET::::- an interrogator who stepped on a Qur'an during an interrogation.

</ul>
The investigation also revealed 15 alleged cases of Qur'an mistreatment by detainees themselves. Detainees used Qur'ans as pillows, urinated on them, and, several times, tore pages out of copies of the books, according to the report. For example, the report states that a guard observed a "detainee place two Qur'ans in his toilet and state he no longer cared about the Qur'an or his religion," on February 23, 2004. It is believed that such behavior is intended to cause disruption and problems for the guards.

Overnight Friday a Southerly storm brought snow to both the Southern Alps and the central North Island mountains of &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; for the first time this year, closing major roads and stranding travellers at the start of the Queens Birthday holiday weekend. Police and &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Automobile%20Association"&gt;the AA&lt;/a&gt; urged motorists to drive with ♡❤extra care♡❤ and ♡❤to the conditions♡❤ this weekend.
In the North Island, State Highway 1 between Waiouru and Rangipo, the Desert Road was closed by deep snow at 3 PM on Friday afternoon. Other roads in the area, including other parts of State Highway 1 between Bulls and Turangi, State Highway 4, via National Park, and 49, via Ohakune, were closed at 8 PM. 

These road closures stopped all traffic through the centre of the North Island. About 200 travellers were reported to have spent the night at the Waiouru Army Camp, being accommodated in the Marae and the Barracks. Grit trucks and snow ploughs worked overnight to clear the snow and reopen roads, with the Desert Road finally being reopened about 12:30 PM Saturday.

Together with a slip threatening to close State Highway 3 in the Manawatu Gorge and damage to State Highway 2 after floods in the Bay of Plenty a couple of weeks ago, the only reliable alternative route for travellers around the North Island was via Wanganui and Taranaki.

In the South Island, Police and the AA advised that ♡❤chains were essential♡❤ when travelling over the mountain passes.

Yesterday, Mount Hutt skifield announced it would be opening Saturday morning. Early Saturday morning, skiers were reported to be queuing at the gates of Mount Hutt skifield, eager to get the first opportunity to hit the slopes in 2005. Other South Island ski fields were also indicating June opening dates.

The weather outlook is for cold southerly winds and rain over the Queens Birthday holiday weekend, with snow down to 400m in the South Island.

After an investigation of allegations that &lt;a href="Islam"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aholy%20book"&gt;holy book&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AQu%27ran"&gt;Qu'ran&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was mishandled in front of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ainmates"&gt;inmates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at &lt;a href="Guantanamo%20Bay"&gt;Guantanamo Bay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Cuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABush%20administration"&gt;Bush administration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has acknowledged the credibility of some of these reports. According to Robert Burns of the Associated Press, &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; military officials acknowledged that, "a Muslim holy book was splashed with urine," and "a detainee's Quran was deliberately kicked and another's was stepped on." The US government first denied a specific report that the Qu'ran had been flushed down a toilet at the prison facility, but on Friday agreed that similar allegations were indeed true.

On May 16, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANewsweek"&gt;Newsweek&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; magazine apologized to the victims of deadly riots that ensued due to a Newsweek article stating that U.S. officials defiled the Qur'an. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House%20Press%20Secretary"&gt;Press Secretary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AScott%20McClellan"&gt;Scott McClellan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; criticized Newsweek's initial response to the incident, saying it was "puzzling." Later that day, Newsweek retracted the story, which the White House said was a "good first step".

On May 20, the &lt;a href="International%20Red%20Cross"&gt;International Red Cross&lt;/a&gt; (IRC) revealed in a rare public announcement that it had documented and reported to the United States credible information concerning desecration of the Qur'an by Guantanamo Bay personnel. Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman, acknowledged that allegations were made on "rare occasions" but were uncorroborated. Simon Schorno, a Red Cross spokesman, disputed the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APentagon"&gt;Pentagon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's denial saying, "All information we received were corroborated allegations." He added that, "We certainly corroborated mentions of the events by detainees themselves," and that "the ICRC considers such reports "very seriously, and very carefully, and [we] document everything."
Scott McClellan explained in a press conference that the White House is not trying to tell Newsweek what to print. McClellan said, "Look, this report caused serious damage to the image of the United States abroad. And Newsweek has said that they got it wrong. I think Newsweek recognizes the responsibility they have. We appreciate the step that they took by retracting the story. Now we would encourage them to move forward and do all that they can to help repair the damage that has been done by this report. And that's all I'm saying. But, no, you're absolutely right, it's not my position to get into telling people what they can and cannot report."

On May 25, &lt;a href="Amnesty%20International"&gt;Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt; called for the shutdown on Guantanamo Bay due to numerous human rights violations, saying "The 'war on terror' appeared more effective in eroding international human rights principles than in countering international 'terrorism'." Amnesty International's view was shared by both the &lt;a href="International%20Red%20Cross"&gt;International Red Cross&lt;/a&gt; (IRC) and the &lt;a href="American%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union"&gt;American Civil Liberties Union&lt;/a&gt; (ACLU). The IRC has said it reported to the U.S. government detainee's reports of desecration of the Qur'an. In the foreword of the report, written by Amnesty International Secretary General &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIrene%20Khan"&gt;Irene Khan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Guantanamo was compared to a Soviet-era gulag in that it is "entrenching the practice of arbitrary and indefinite detention in violation of international law".

White House spokesman Scott McClellan responded saying the report's allegations were "ridiculous and unsupported by the facts. The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; is leading the way when it comes to protecting &lt;a href="human%20rights"&gt;human rights&lt;/a&gt; and promoting &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ahuman%20dignity"&gt;human dignity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . We have &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aliberation"&gt;liberated&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 50 million people in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;. We have worked to advance &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Afreedom"&gt;freedom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ademocracy"&gt;democracy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the world so that people are governed under a rule of law and that there are... protections in place for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aminority%20rights"&gt;minority rights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , that &lt;a href="women%27s%20rights"&gt;women's rights&lt;/a&gt; are advanced so that women can fully participate in societies where now they cannot", as well as supporting the fight against &lt;a href="AIDS"&gt;AIDS&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;.

About the allegations of abuse at Guantanamo, which McClellan has previously called isolated incidents, he said, "We hold people accountable when there is abuse. We take steps to prevent it from happening again, and we do so in a very public way for the world to see that we lead by example, and that we do have values that we hold very dearly and believe in."

On May 31, U.S. President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; dismissed the human rights report as "absurd" for its harsh criticism of U.S. treatment of terrorist suspects at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, saying the allegations were made by prisoners "who hate America." "It's an absurd allegation. The United States is a country that promotes freedom around the world," Bush said of the Amnesty International report.

William F. Schulz, executive director of Amnesty International USA, defended the report, saying, "What is 'absurd' is President Bush's attempt to deny the deliberate policies of his administration." and "What is 'absurd' and indeed outrageous is the Bush administration's failure to undertake a full independent investigation". Irene Khan also responded saying, "The administration's response has been that our report is absurd, that our allegations have no basis, and our answer is very simple: if that is so, open up these detention centres, allow us and others to visit them."

And, on Friday, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20military"&gt;U.S. military&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; released the results of their investigation and confirmed that in 5 separate incidents, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; guards at the Guantánamo Bay prison "mishandled" the &lt;a href="Islam"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;ic holy book. However, they stress that guards were usually "respectful" of the Qur'an. One incident involved splashing a Koran with urine by urinating near an air vent while others involved kicking, stepping on and writing in Qur'ans.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABrigadier-General%20Jay%20Hood"&gt;Brigadier-General Jay Hood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the commander of the jail, looked into the allegations, published and then retracted by Newsweek, that American personnel flushed a Qur'an down a toilet. He said that the inquiry did not find any evidence supporting this particular allegation. "The inquiry found no credible evidence that a member of the Joint Task Force at Guantanamo Bay ever flushed a Qur'an down a toilet. This matter is considered closed."

Partygaming Plc, the worlds largest &lt;a href="w%3AOnline%20Poker"&gt;online poker&lt;/a&gt; company, has announced that it intends to float on the &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Stock%20Exchange"&gt;London Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt; by the end of this month. Although it has not yet set a price, analysts in ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACity%20of%20London"&gt;The City&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ are speculating that the flotation could value the firm at up to STG£5bn. Such a valuation would make the flotation the largest in four years.

The &lt;a href="w%3AGibraltar"&gt;Gibraltar&lt;/a&gt;-based company, which owns the Partypoker brand, intends to sell 23% of the company in the flotation. If the company's initial public offering is successful, the firm will enter the &lt;a href="w%3AFTSE%20100%20Index"&gt;FTSE 100 Index&lt;/a&gt; (the top 100 firms on the exchange by value). Its value would be greater than that of both &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Airways"&gt;British Airways&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABoots%20Group"&gt;Boots&lt;/a&gt;.

Partygaming Plc was founded in 1997 by &lt;a href="w%3AAnurag%20Dikshit"&gt;Anurag Dikshit&lt;/a&gt; and has since grown at a huge rate - doubling profits in the past year alone to STG£371m. At peak times it attracts 70,000 simultaneous players.

Italian firefighters say a truck burst into flames inside the 13 km (8 mile) Frejus tunnel under the &lt;a href="w%3AAlps"&gt;Alps&lt;/a&gt;. Two bodies have been recovered from the tunnel between &lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;. According to the Italian news agency ANSA, the truck which caught fire was carrying tires, and the fire has spread to three other vehicles: another truck, loaded with paint, a van of the French tunnel company and a car. For much of the night, Italian emergency services were being held back about a mile from the fire by the intense heat, but the fire has now been put out. Several vehicles are thought to be still in the tunnel. Police are trying to contact a group of people who escaped on foot in order to assess whether people were trapped inside.

French officials have stated that all people who made it to safety alcoves (ventilated shelters directly linked to a fresh air shaft) on the French side of the tunnel have been safely rescued. The Italian side of the tunnel is now being searched for bodies by the Italian emergency services.
The tunnel has a 0.54% uphill gradient going from the French to the Italian side. Heat and smoke generally escaped on the Italian side, as the uphill tunnel acted like a &lt;a href="w%3Achimney"&gt;chimney&lt;/a&gt; that sucked in cold fresh air from the French side.

Val Fréjus is a city on the French side of the border, in the &lt;a href="w%3ARh%C3%B4ne-Alpes"&gt;Rhône-Alpes&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3Ad%C3%A9partement"&gt;département&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

A fire in a similar tunnel under the Alps (the &lt;a href="w%3AMont%20Blanc%20Tunnel"&gt;Mont Blanc Tunnel&lt;/a&gt;) reached temperatures of 1,000° &lt;a href="w%3ACelsius"&gt;Celsius&lt;/a&gt; and killed 39 people in &lt;a href="w%3A1999"&gt;1999&lt;/a&gt;.

There are often odd, unusual and controversial items up for sale on &lt;a href="w%3AeBay"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt; - multi-million euro planes, the &lt;a href="w%3APope"&gt;Pope's&lt;/a&gt; old car and a young woman's virginity, to name just a few. But how about the Prime Minister's shoes? 

Shoes custom designed for former &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Prime%20Minister"&gt;British Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMargaret%20Thatcher"&gt;Margaret Thatcher&lt;/a&gt; have been put up for sale on eBay. The shoes, which have a reserve price of £2,930 (US $3,580), are currently owned by 65 year old Eleanor Graham. Ms. Graham bought them in a &lt;a href="w%3ASue%20Ryder"&gt;Sue Ryder&lt;/a&gt; charity shop after seeing a member of Thatcher's staff drop them in the shop. She guessed that they would increase in value over the years, so Ms. Graham purchased them.

The Rayne shoes - which come in gold, silver and black suede - are size five and come with a letter received in 2001 from Ms Thatchers office confirming that she did wear Rayne shoes. 

You can see the shoes at eBay by clicking &lt;a href="http%3A//cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll%3FViewItem%26amp%3Bcategory%3D367%26amp%3Bitem%3D3977480851%26amp%3Brd%3D1%26amp%3BssPageName%3DWDVW"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

Having come back in the final minute of time to draw 1-1 with &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ATel%20Aviv"&gt;Tel Aviv&lt;/a&gt; two months ago, &lt;a href="w%3ABrian%20Kerr"&gt;Brian Kerr's&lt;/a&gt; squad were determined not to let it happen a second time in last nights sell out &lt;a href="w%3ALansdowne%20Road"&gt;Lansdowne Road&lt;/a&gt; Group 4 &lt;a href="w%3AFootball%20World%20Cup"&gt;World Cup&lt;/a&gt; qualifier clash. However despite two early goals for the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20of%20Ireland%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Republic of Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Israelis&lt;/a&gt; still managed to claw back a draw - much to the dismay of onlooking Irish supporters.

After just five minutes, Ian Harte scored from a 25 yard free kick putting the homeside ahead just like in the first match. However unlike in the first game, the Irish did not slow down the pace and become conservative. At the 11th minute mark, &lt;a href="w%3ARobbie%20Keane"&gt;Robbie Keane&lt;/a&gt; scored Ireland's second goal of the match; much to the delight - and even moreso relief of the Irish supporters in the crowd of 34,000.

In a seemingly comfortable position, disaster hit the Irish team when Robbie Keane left for the bench with a shoulder injury sustained in the third minute of the game. As the 40th minute approached, Israel's Benayoun and Avi Yehiel combined efforts to put the ball in the back of the Irish net to bring their team back into the game. Things went from bad to worse for the Irish as the first half drew to a close with &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20O%27Shea%20%28footballer%29"&gt;John O'Shea&lt;/a&gt; getting a yellow card in the Irish box - and giving his opposition a penalty. The penalty was scored three time by Nimni, but only on his third attempt did it count - the first two disallowed because the referee had not blown his whistle.

The second half proved to be less fruitious for both teams, with no goals scored. The Irish became increasingly frustrated as the game progressed because of perceived Israeli time-wasting. As the game became more scrappy Andy O'Brien got sent off when he attempted to block the Israeli keeper from punching the ball.

The game finished 2-2, much to the despair of the Irish squad, who now can only draw encouragement from the fact that they remain ahead of &lt;a href="w%3AFrance%20national%20football%20team"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; in the group table.

<h1>Mars rover Opportunity successfully escapes sand trap</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Mars%20rover%20Opportunity%20successfully%20escapes%20sand%20trap&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AOpportunity%20rover"&gt;Mars rover Opportunity&lt;/a&gt; has successfully escaped from a sand trap. &lt;a href="w%3AJPL"&gt;JPL&lt;/a&gt; engineers cheered when images returned from &lt;a href="w%3AMars"&gt;Mars&lt;/a&gt; showed the rover's wheels were free. Engineers worked for nearly five weeks to carefully maneuver the rover out of the sand dune.

"After a nerve-wracking month of hard work, the rover team is both elated and relieved to finally see our wheels sitting on top of the sand instead of half buried in it," said Jeffrey Biesiadecki, a JPL rover mobility engineer.

Traction was difficult in the ripple-shaped dune of windblown dust and sand that Opportunity drove into on &lt;a href="w%3AApril%2026"&gt;April 26&lt;/a&gt;. In the weeks following, the rover churned 192 &lt;a href="w%3Ameter"&gt;meters&lt;/a&gt; (629 &lt;a href="w%3Afeet"&gt;feet&lt;/a&gt;) worth of wheel rotations before gaining enough traction to actually move one meter (about three feet). The rover team directed the drives in cautious increments from &lt;a href="w%3AMay%2013"&gt;May 13&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href="w%3AJune%204"&gt;June 4&lt;/a&gt;.

"We did careful testing for how to get Opportunity out of the sand. Then we patiently followed the strategy developed from the testing, monitoring every step of the way," Biesiadecki said. "We hope to have Opportunity busy with a full schedule of scientific exploration again shortly."
Opportunity's next task is to examine the site to provide a better understanding of what makes that ripple different from the dozens of similar ones the rover easily crossed. "After we analyze this area, we'll be able to plan safer driving in the terrain ahead," said JPL's Jim Erickson, rover project manager.

Both &lt;a href="w%3ASpirit%20rover"&gt;Spirit&lt;/a&gt; and Opportunity have worked in harsh Martian conditions much longer than anticipated. They have been studying geology on opposite sides of Mars for more than a year of extended missions since successfully completing their three-month primary missions in April &lt;a href="w%3A2004"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;.

"The first thing we're going to do is simply take a hard look at the stuff we were stuck in," said Dr. Steve Squyres of &lt;a href="w%3ACornell%20University"&gt;Cornell University&lt;/a&gt;, Ithaca, N.Y. He is the principal investigator for the Mars rovers' science instruments. "After that, we will begin a cautious set of moves to get us on our way southward again. South is where we think the best science is, so that's still where we want to go."

Shortly after landing in January 2004, Opportunity found layered bedrock that bore geological evidence for a shallow ancient &lt;a href="w%3Asea"&gt;sea&lt;/a&gt;. Spirit did not find extensive layered bedrock until more than a year later, after driving more than two miles and climbing into a range of hills known as "Columbia Hills."

&lt;a href="w%3ASwitzerland"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt; is voting today on their quarterly federal &lt;a href="w%3Areferendum"&gt;referenda&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;a href="w%3Acivil%20union"&gt;same-sex partnerships&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ASchengen%20treaty"&gt;Schengen/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADublin%20Convention"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt; treaty. Both proposals were &lt;a href="w%3Apopular%20initiative"&gt;popular initiatives&lt;/a&gt; made by the Swiss people.

The first question is whether same-sex partnership should be legalised throughout the country. Already the cantons of &lt;a href="w%3ACanton%20of%20Geneva"&gt;Geneva&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACanton%20of%20Z%C3%BCrich"&gt;Zürich&lt;/a&gt; allow same-sex partnerships, however this proposal will cover the country including the conservative north-eastern cantons of &lt;a href="w%3AGraub%C3%BCnden"&gt;Graubünden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAppenzell"&gt;Appenzell&lt;/a&gt;. In fact &lt;a href="w%3AAppenzell%20Innerrhoden"&gt;Appenzell Innerrhoden&lt;/a&gt; only allowed women the vote at cantonal level in 1990 by the &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Tribunal%20of%20Switzerland"&gt;Federal Tribunal of Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;.

Essentially, this proposal will allow gays and lesbians the right to have joint taxes, pensions and inheritance. To qualify, partners must both live together and formally commit themselves six months in advance to running a household and supporting and aiding one another.

The second proposal will make Switzerland be a member of the Schengen treaty and participate in the “open-borders” scheme. Supporters say it would encourage tourism and make visiting much easier, especially after the row over Swiss-&lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; border a few months ago. Together with the Dublin treaty, it would make Switzerland join a bilateral agreement to stop asylum seekers having to seek asylum in Switzerland after claiming asylum in an agreement country such as Germany or France. 

Opponents say this proposal will set Switzerland on a slippery slope into the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;, not give Switzerland the right to its own borders and compromise the country's strict and engrained &lt;a href="w%3Aneutral%20country"&gt;neutrality&lt;/a&gt;.

Out of the big 4 main parties, the centre-left &lt;a href="w%3ASocial%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Switzerland"&gt;Social Democrats&lt;/a&gt;, the liberal-right &lt;a href="w%3AFree%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Switzerland"&gt;Free Democrats&lt;/a&gt; and the centre-right &lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20Democratic%20People%27s%20Party%20of%20Switzerland"&gt;Christian Democrats&lt;/a&gt; have said yes to both proposals. However, the populist-right &lt;a href="w%3ASwiss%20People%27s%20Party"&gt;Swiss People's Party&lt;/a&gt; have said no to both proposals

Results will start being available today in the early evening.

<h1>Computer Associates warns of massive botnet attack</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Computer%20Associates%20warns%20of%20massive%20botnet%20attack&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Computer Associates are warning of a current three pronged, co-ordinated &lt;a href="w%3Amalware"&gt;malware&lt;/a&gt; attack on computers that are using &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20Windows"&gt;Microsoft Windows&lt;/a&gt; and are connected to the &lt;a href="w%3AInternet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt;. The attack involves the use of three different &lt;a href="w%3ATrojan%20horse%20%28computing%29"&gt;Trojan horses&lt;/a&gt; called Glieder, Fantibag and Mitglieder. The goal is to create a &lt;a href="w%3Abotnet"&gt;botnet&lt;/a&gt; consisting of a large number of compromised computers. Access to this group of compromised machines will then be available on a black market, at prices as low as five cents per machine.

<ul>
BULLET::::- Win32.Glieder.AK: The first of the three, this &lt;a href="w%3ATrojan%20horse%20%28computing%29"&gt;Trojan horse&lt;/a&gt; attempts to de-activate an extensive list of security/&lt;a href="w%3AAnti-virus%20software"&gt;antivirus&lt;/a&gt; related processes and services running on the target computer. It also attempts to lower security settings in order to facilitate easier access for subsequent &lt;a href="w%3ATrojan%20horse%20%28computing%29"&gt;Trojan horses&lt;/a&gt;.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- Fantibag: This second &lt;a href="w%3ATrojan%20horse%20%28computing%29"&gt;Trojan horse&lt;/a&gt; creates filters on the target machine in order to prevent access to a large number of antivirus companies' Web sites. Thus, not only is the target computer now well and truly compromised, but an average Windows user will be completely unable to remove these violations of their system.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- Mitgleider: Once the first two &lt;a href="w%3ATrojan%20horse%20%28computing%29"&gt;Trojan horses&lt;/a&gt; have largely eliminated any possibility that the target will be able to defend itself, this one finishes the job. It opens port 38884 and configures it to act as a SOCKS 4 proxy, but the compromised system can now also be commanded to do the following:-
<ul>
BULLET::::- Changing the backdoor port number
BULLET::::- Updating the trojan
BULLET::::- Downloading and execute files
BULLET::::- Uninstalling the trojan
BULLET::::- Initiating an SMTP server on TCP port 25, which can be used to relay spam.
BULLET::::- Executing files on the infected computer
BULLET::::- Downloading and executing files via an URL

</ul>
</ul>
It should be noted that these &lt;a href="w%3ATrojan%20horse%20%28computing%29"&gt;Trojan horses&lt;/a&gt; only affect the &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20Windows"&gt;Microsoft Windows&lt;/a&gt; family of operating systems. No other operating systems (such as &lt;a href="w%3ALinux"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AApple%20Computer"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AMac%20OS%20X"&gt;OS X&lt;/a&gt;) are vulnerable. In order to prevent infection, &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20Windows"&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt; users are advised to ensure that they have the latest operating system patches from &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, that their chosen &lt;a href="w%3AAnti-virus%20software"&gt;antivirus&lt;/a&gt; software is up to date, and that they are using &lt;a href="w%3Afirewall%20%28networking%29"&gt;firewall&lt;/a&gt; software where appropriate.
