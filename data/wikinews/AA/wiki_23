Ted Hollis, a criminal attorney from &lt;a href="w%3APittsburgh%2C%20Pennsylvania"&gt;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, is suing the creator of a website which allows women to complain about men they have dated after being named by two women on the self-proclaimed controversial site.

The website, &lt;a href="w%3ADontDateHimGirl.com"&gt;DontDateHimGirl.com&lt;/a&gt;, allows women to use a search engine to find alleged deceivers. It calls itself "a powerful online resource that lets women out the men who have cheated on or lied to them". As well as featuring a discussion board that enables women to criticise partners, the website also includes the names, details, and photographs of so-called cheats. Men can respond to postings, but they can't get them erased.

According to Hollis, two local women claimed the man was, among other things, two-timing. Mr Hollis added that he is blameless, and that the website should check the reliability of the information it contains.

Tasha Joseph, the creator of DontDateHimGirl.com, notes that this is the first lawsuit filed against her website. She claims that she cannot be held responsible for the comments of others. This is due to her status as a provider, as opposed to a publisher or a writer, under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.

Ricardo was the hero for Portugal making three saves to defeat a resolute England team that had been down to 10 men since 62 minutes.

Portugal were the better team on the day having got twice as many shots than England and 57 per cent of ball possession. Ronaldo was a terror holding down England's left flank. 

However; England's excellent defending kept the score level for 120 minutes. Portugal captain Luis Figo was one of Portugal's less effective players due to England's quickness into the challenge and was substituted for Helder Postiga on 86 minutes.

Owen Hargreaves won the Fifa Man of the Match award for many important tackles breaking up dangerous Portugal plays near the England penalty area. The crowd in the Veltins Arena enjoyed the drama of penalties in part due to the hard work of the Bayern Munich player, particularly when England were down to ten.

The turning point of an uneventful first hour, which saw neither keeper troubled, was Wayne Rooney's sending off. The striker was visibly frustrated with his lone role in England's attack and with two Portugal players attempting to tackle alerted the attention of Horacio Elizondo. A red card rose above the melee in front of the referee and Rooney was off to the dressing room.

Portugal used the extra-man to apply more pressure on England's goal, with Miguel getting to England's goal line. But Luiz Felipe Scolari's team did not finish well. Paul Robinson made nine saves but none tested him. 

In extra-time England mounted counter attacks but did not cross well and managed only four shots on target in the game.

Portugal won on penalties against England in the Euro 2004 championship and after Frank Lampard's effort was saved by the magnificent Ricardo the result did not look like it would go any other way.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=France%20beat%20Brazil%201-0%20to%20take%20last%20semi-final%20spot&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Brazil had not lost a Fifa World Cup match since the 1998 game but Zinedine Zidane, the three times World Player of the Year who had authored Brazil's downfall in Paris, left the signature of his gifts in his trademark flair at the Commerzbank Arena.

The experienced French defense of Liliam Thuram, Claude Makelele and Patrick Viera did their bit to confine the 2002 World Champions to a single shot on target in 90 minutes. The attacking pace and skill of newcomer Frank Ribery ripped Brazilian defence open and Zidane found him time and time again.

Thierry Henry scored the only goal of the game 12 minutes after half-time. Zidane flighted a free kick to the far post where Henry ran in and jumped to side-foot a volley past Dida.

Zidane's performance in the eyes of experienced observers reawakened memories of his best games for France. He orchestrated nearly everything France did well and always had time for graceful turns, effortless passes, mesmerizing footwork that evaded legs to keep the ball under control.

If 34 year old Zidane played like the game might have been his last match, Brazil's Ronaldo, Cafu and Roberto Carlos, also over 30, were unable to rise to the same heights on this occasion. 

On 90 minutes Ronaldinho had a free kick opportunity 25 yards from goal but it was not to be the 2006 Fifa Player of the Year's night either; his shot fizzed over the bar.

The result meant Raymond Domenech's side would meet Portugal in the semi-final round of the World Cup in Munich on Wednesday, July 5.

&lt;a href="w%3AHugo%20Ch%C3%A1vez"&gt;Hugo Chávez&lt;/a&gt; called on Africa Saturday to develop closer ties with Latin America to fight what he called the threat of U.S.A. hegemony.

"In Venezuela, we were tired of all our oil going to Count Dracula," Chávez said to applause in the Gambian capital of &lt;a href="w%3ABanjul"&gt;Banjul&lt;/a&gt;. "Now Venezuela is free and we have recovered control over our oil. We should march together, Africa and Latin America, brother continents with the same roots ... Only together can we change the direction of the world," he told the opening day of the African Union summit. In Africa "we know there are international companies that do not pay taxes on what they get from petrol, or some pay very little." Chávez said.

"The world is threatened by the hegemony of the North American empire," said Chávez, following speeches that had criticized colonialism; speeches made by African leaders.

Hugo Chávez is attending the African Union summit and has long been opposed to U.S Foreign policy. He has also praised the leader of Iran in his policies against the U.S and raised taxes significantly on oil companies in Venezuela.

&lt;a href="w%3ACanada%20Day"&gt;Canada Day&lt;/a&gt; was celebrated at &lt;a href="w%3AParliament%20Hill"&gt;Parliament Hill&lt;/a&gt;. People came across Canada to &lt;a href="w%3AOttawa"&gt;Ottawa&lt;/a&gt; to celebrate Canada's 139th birthday.

About 25,000 people including Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt;, his wife and their two children were there. The party got started at about 12:00, noon &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20American%20Eastern%20Time%20Zone"&gt;ET&lt;/a&gt;. The ceremony was in English and in French.

Military veterans, medal-winning Olympic athletes and some of Canada's biggest names in music were there. Canadian artists like &lt;a href="w%3AColin%20James"&gt;Colin James&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAnnie%20Villeneuve"&gt;Annie Villeneuve&lt;/a&gt; performed in front of the &lt;a href="w%3APeace%20Tower"&gt;Peace Tower&lt;/a&gt;. Other performers included &lt;a href="w%3AJesse%20Cook"&gt;Jesse Cook&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ASamba%20Squad"&gt;Samba Squad&lt;/a&gt;. Since Canada has two official languages (English and French) some artists were from &lt;a href="w%3AQuebec"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt; and sung in French.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper urged Canadians to pay tribute to the soldiers and aid workers in Afghanistan. "Let's show our appreciation, today and every day, to those who do it best for us in Afghanistan and around the world," Harper said. "Our diplomats, our development workers and brave men and women of the Canadian Forces." said the Prime Minister.

Gov. General. &lt;a href="w%3AMicha%C3%ABlle%20Jean"&gt;Michaëlle Jean&lt;/a&gt; noted Canada's prosperity, including in her remarks a thank you to the people who toil to provide the country with a safe and plentiful food supply. 

"Ours is a country of great wealth from its plains, forests and mountains that nourish us to the crystal clear waters of our abundant lakes and rivers," she said. She was born in &lt;a href="w%3APort-au-Prince"&gt;Port-au-Prince&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHa%C3%AFti"&gt;Haïti&lt;/a&gt; and is the current &lt;a href="w%3AGovernor%20General%20of%20Canada"&gt;Governor General of Canada&lt;/a&gt;. Harper and Jean took part in a wreath laying at the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20War%20Memorial"&gt;National War Memorial&lt;/a&gt; at an event marking the 90th anniversary of the Battles of the Somme and &lt;a href="w%3ABeaumont-Hamel"&gt;Beaumont-Hamel&lt;/a&gt; in France.

&lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Graham"&gt;Bill Graham&lt;/a&gt; released a statement describing Canada as being like no other country, "made up of individuals, representing all ethnicities and all religions, bound together by our shared values of family, community, tolerance and freedom."

Musicians performed in front of the Peace Tower, and fireworks ended the show.

Two contestants from ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABig%20Brother%20%28Australia%29"&gt;Big Brother&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ in Australia have been escorted from the show. Ashley, a pseudonym for Michael Cox of Perth, and John, a pseudonym for Michael Bric of Melbourne, sexually assaulted a contestant known as Camilla. Camilla climbed into John's bed after stating that she wished one of the boys "would put your arrow near me" at around 4.30am. John was then seen to have held her firm as a half-naked Ashley rubbed his penis on her face in an act know as "turkey slapping". Immediately after the incident Camilla grabbed John's penis and laughed as he jumped.

Its unlikely that charges will be laid over the incident. The Age newspaper reported that "Camilla" last night talked about the incident, saying she believed the men were joking. The only people alleging that this was sexual harassment are politicians and journalists.

“We had a great time in the house and it is unfortunate it had to end this way, but BB has rules and regulations and we broke them,” they said in a joint statement. “We are all very close in the house and we would never do anything to offend our fellow housemates.”

This is the first time contestants have been removed from the show for breaching rules.

They will not receive further endorsement or prizes from the show.

"I can't comment [on the sexual allegations]," said David Brown, from &lt;a href="w%3AEndemol%20Southern%20Star"&gt;Southern Star Endemol&lt;/a&gt;, "But their removal from the house should indicate how serious the matter is."

The discussion forum of official ♡❤Big Brother♡❤ site has been shut down due to the incident. There is no notice on when the forum will be reopened.

There are now eight contestants competing for the remaining $275 thousand. It has been reduced after fines for not wearing microphones when talking, discussing nominations and singing commercial music.

Several weeks ago the show's adults-only series, ♡❤Big Brother: Adults Only♡❤, was axed. 

Last year the show was under scrutiny when a male contestant rubbed himself on a female contestant during a massage.

Australian &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; called for the show to be pulled saying "Here is a great opportunity for a bit of self-regulation and get this stupid programme off the air" adding "It is just a question of good taste".

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Israeli%20barrage%20of%20Gaza%20continues%20with%20strike%20on%20PM%27s%20office&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;br style="clear:both;"&gt;

Israel has continued its barrage of the &lt;a href="w%3AGaza%20Strip"&gt;Gaza Strip&lt;/a&gt; with an attack by a helicopter gunship on the office of the Palestinian prime minister. The attack, which left the building ablaze, injured three Palestinian security guards and was described by the prime minister, &lt;a href="w%3AIsmail%20Haniya"&gt;Ismail Haniya&lt;/a&gt;, as senseless. "This is the policy of the jungle and arrogance," Haniya told &lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;. "They have targeted a symbol for the Palestinian people."

Israel claims the attack on Gaza, codenamed &lt;a href="w%3AOperation%20Summer%20Rains"&gt;Operation Summer Rains&lt;/a&gt;, is to pressure the Palestinian government into freeing &lt;a href="w%3AGilad%20Shalit"&gt;Cpl. Gilad Shalit&lt;/a&gt;, the Israeli tank gunner Israel describes as having been &lt;a href="Israeli%20soldier%20taken%20captive"&gt;kidnapped&lt;/a&gt; by Palestinian militants on Monday.

Other Israeli strikes on Saturday night hit a school in &lt;a href="w%3AGaza%20City"&gt;Gaza City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AHamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt; facilities in the town of &lt;a href="w%3AJabalia"&gt;Jabalia&lt;/a&gt; in the north of the strip where one 34-year-old Hamas operative was killed and another wounded.

<h2>"Difficult days"</h2>
Israeli prime minister &lt;a href="w%3AEhud%20Olmert"&gt;Ehud Olmert&lt;/a&gt; stated "these are difficult days for Israel," and continued to proclaim that "we won't give in to terror." Olmert's cabinet met on Sunday morning to discuss the continuing operation in Gaza and the, as yet unsuccessful, efforts to have Shalit returned to Israel.

Palestinian militant sources claimed overnight that an agreement over the release of the soldier was close. They stipulated that Israel must make a commitment to a third party to future releases of Palestinian prisoners and end its attacks on the Gaza Strip, although they accepted that immediate releases were unlikely. 

Mark Regev, a spokesman for Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, rejected these demands and said that Israel would make no deals.

<h2>Attacks labelled "war crimes"</h2>

In other developments, human rights group &lt;a href="w%3AAmnesty%20International"&gt;Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt; described what they called Israeli forces' deliberate attacks against civilian property and infrastructure as acts which "violate international humanitarian law and constitute war crimes." &lt;a href="w%3AProtocol%20I"&gt;Protocol I&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AGeneva%20Conventions"&gt;Geneva Conventions&lt;/a&gt; prohibits "indiscriminate attacks ... which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated."

"Israel must now take urgent measures to remedy the long-term damage it has caused and immediately restore the supply - at its own cost - of electricity and water to the Palestinian population in the affected areas," urged the organization. "As the occupying power, Israel is bound under international law to protect and safeguard the basic human rights of the Palestinian population," Amnesty International said.

Israeli air strikes earlier damaged Gaza's only power plant, knocking out 43 percent of the electricity supply to 1.4 million Palestinians. &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; and Palestinian officials predicted water shortages and sewage flooding within days if emergency generators run out of fuel. Israel has closed border crossings and shut off its fuel pipeline into Gaza. 

"I'll be lucky if I can continue [pumping] for a few days. Then, unfortunately, there will be shortages of drinking water," stated the mayor of Gaza City, Majed Abu Ramadan. 

Water shortages could lead to a health crisis in the Gaza Strip, with some reports of hospitals already cutting back on routine care in order to save fuel. It is expected that damage to the power plant will take five to six months to repair.

<h2>University Airstrike</h2>

There have also been witness reports of the bombing of a pro-Hamas Islamic University within Gaza City. Initially reported by the &lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters News Agency&lt;/a&gt; the army has said it is looking into the report. There were no casualties.

&lt;a href="w%3ARyutaro%20Hashimoto"&gt;Ryūtarō Hashimoto&lt;/a&gt;, who served as Prime Minister of &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; from 1996 to 1998, died in a Tokyo hospital on July 1, 2006. He was 68 years old.

Born in &lt;a href="w%3ASoja%20city"&gt;Soja city&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AOkayama%20Prefecture"&gt;Okayama Prefecture&lt;/a&gt;, he moved through the ranks of the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Democratic%20Party%20%28Japan%29"&gt;Liberal Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; (LDP), getting elected to the lower house of parliament for 14 consecutive terms. He held several cabinet posts and in 1989 became secretary general of the LDP. 

He was Prime Minister of Japan from January 11, 1996 to July 30, 1998. He remained a powerful back-room player in Japanese politics until scandal forced him to resign his leadership position in 2004.

Police have charged five people with drug-related offences while 12 were taken to hospital during a &lt;a href="w%3Arave"&gt;rave&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AHomebush%20Bay%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Homebush Bay&lt;/a&gt;, a suburb in &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney's&lt;/a&gt; inner-west overnight. Over 4,500 people attended the party.

The party was held overnight at Sydney Showground at &lt;a href="w%3ASydney%20Olympic%20Park"&gt;Sydney Olympic Park&lt;/a&gt;, Homebush Bay - the home of the &lt;a href="w%3A2000%20Olympics"&gt;2000 Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt;.

According to police, 12 party-goers were taken by ambulance to &lt;a href="w%3AAuburn%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Auburn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AConcord%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Concord&lt;/a&gt; hospitals where they were treated for suspected drug overdoses. All are believed to be in a satisfactory condition.

Inside the rave, police arrested two males and a female. The males, aged 19 and 20 were charged with drug possession and a female, aged 35 was charged with two counts of drug possession. 

Outside the party, police charged a 16-year-old male with drug possession and supplying a prohibited drug. Police also charged a 27-year-old male for drug possession outside the venue.

During the rave, security reported that they removed three people following offensive conduct. The rave ended at 7 a.m. without further incident according to police.

A suicide bomber exploded a truck bomb in the crowded Al-Ula market in &lt;a href="w%3ASadr%20City"&gt;Sadr City&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday, killing 66 people and injuring over a 100.

'At the beginning of this market, the criminal blew up his dynamite-packed truck after trying to go over the pavement,' said Iraq's Deputy Health Minister Sabah al-Hussein. 

The explosion happened when a police patrol was passing by and caused heavy casualties in the morning market rush. Some shoppers were sent flying on top of nearby two-storey buildings.

The force of the blast left a large crater and wreckage of blown-out cars and windowless buildings. Rescuers were left to pick through a sickening scene of human remains mixed in with exploded vegetable matter and dead animals.

Sadr City, a Shiite city of two million in which religious leader Moqtada Sadr has found popular support, had many times before been targeted by Sunni terrorists who were blamed by some residents for this attack.

It was the deadliest bombing of civilians since Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ANouri%20al-Maliki"&gt;Nouri al-Maliki&lt;/a&gt;'s government assumed responsibility for domestic security in May 2006.

Experts said the truck bomb was a lethal concoction of explosives, shells and shrapnel hidden under a consignment of fruit. The driver of the truck blew himself up in the explosion.

<h1>Rally in Australian forests to oppose woodchip industry</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Rally%20in%20Australian%20forests%20to%20oppose%20woodchip%20industry&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A rally organised by a coalition of nearly 30 environmental groups took place at the site of the &lt;a href="w%3AEden%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Eden&lt;/a&gt; wood chip mill in the south east forests of &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; today. Organisers estimate that 600 people attended the event, many of whom had travelled hundreds of kilometers to the site from various parts of New South Wales and &lt;a href="w%3AVictoria"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt;.

The protesters sought to highlight the trade in wood chips made from &lt;a href="w%3Aold%20growth"&gt;old growth&lt;/a&gt; native forests which has continued in Australia despite promises by governments to discontinue the practice. It is thought to be an unnecessary sacrifice of a publicly owned resource and the habitat of native animals for short term profits. The industry is subsidised through provision of publicly funded infrastructure and a unreasonably low royalty levied on harvesters of the resource.

All Eden wood chips are exported, mostly to pulp and paper mills in Japan and the paper made from Eden chips is generally copy paper used in the printing industry and it is consumed within Japan. Since its establishment, Eden has exported over 35 million tonnes of native forest chips.

The Eden chip mill exports approximately 900,000 tonnes of chips a year, and is heading for 1 million tonnes in the next couple of years, produced from native forests each year and Australia is the only country that continues to trade forest wood chips to Japan, as all other supplier countries use plantation stock to produce chips.

The rally was organised with police cooperation and was conducted without any incident.

In what may be the first wiki sites to do so, two websites have (independently) begun to offer ad revenue sharing to their wiki contributors. 

&lt;a href="http%3A//www.wikitysplit.com/wiki/Main_Page"&gt;Wikitysplit.com&lt;/a&gt; began its site on March 15, 2006.1

Another website, &lt;a href="http%3A//allyourideas.com"&gt;Allyourideas.com&lt;/a&gt;, which had been existence since September 4, 2005, began its ad revenue sharing on March 31, 2006, having started its ad sharing independently and without knowledge of the former site.

Both sites allow creators of wiki pages to get a potential share of the site's ad revenue. AllYourIdeas.com also offers editors of others' pages the chance to make money from their edits.

The present compensation system listed at these sites is as follows. Wikitysplit states it will add ads 50% of the time to be credited to the original author, whereas AllYourIdeas only offers them 35% of the time. However, AllYourIdeas will credit the remaining 65% of the credit to the most frequent editor of the page (which, of course, in the beginning at least, will be its creator).4 (The site owner of the latter states that he always obtains revenues for one of the other ads on the pages.)

Allyourideas.com also offers a means on each relevant page for Paypal donations to be received by the site founder and most frequent editor.

Revenue sharing has become a popular means for businesses to gain visitors to their sites. Google is famous for widening this possibility for individual site owners with its Adsense program, and later opening it up to blogs in conjunction with &lt;a href="http%3A//blogger.com"&gt;Blogger.com&lt;/a&gt;. Later, a &lt;a href="http%3A//www.wikitysplit.com/wiki/Adsense_Revenue_Sharing"&gt;number of forums&lt;/a&gt; eventually began to offer this chance for revenue to their own contributors, starting with &lt;a href="http%3A//forums.digitalpoint.com/"&gt;Digitalpoint&lt;/a&gt;.4

Asteroid &lt;a href="w%3A2004%20XP14"&gt;2004 XP&lt;/a&gt;, a half-mile wide chunk of hard rock travelling at 40 000 miles an hour, will miss the Earth by a few hundred thousand miles, Monday.

Dr David Asher from the Armagh Observatory in Northern Ireland said if the rock, discovered in 2004, were to hit the Earth the result would be devastating. "It would probably be big enough to wipe out a small country," he said. 

Amateur astronomers with 6-inch telescopes would be able to follow the speeding space debris in Europe and North America at its closest approach to the planet at 0425 &lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated_Universal_Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;. 

At this time it would be at a safe distance of 268,624 miles from Earth - closer to the Earth than the Moon would be at its farthest extent in its orbit.

2004 XP is named as a &lt;a href="w%3APotentially_hazardous_asteroid"&gt;Potentially Hazardous Asteroid&lt;/a&gt; (PHA), along with 782 known others by Astronomers at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory at Harvard. 

Zipping about in the solar system no PHAs have yet been found on direct collision course with the Earth. Still, "For something of this size to come this close is unusual," said Don Yeomans, the head of NASA's Near Earth Object Program."

An expert at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California said it was the closest approach by such a massive object for over 80 years - since 1925.

Before 2004 XP's exact orbital path around the sun was known with more precision, there were concerns it would hit the Earth. 

In the near future Jon Giorgini said such cosmic uncertainty would be much less and the public less alarmed. "In the next 20 to 30 years, we'll have a complete catalog of hazardous objects," Giorgini said. 

Edward Lu and Stanley Love, of Johnson Space Centre, Houston, also have allayed fears about a collision. In a 2005 article in ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANature_%2528journal%2529"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ they theorised a "gravity tractor" could move any known threat within a year.

&lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Beckham"&gt;David Beckham&lt;/a&gt;, a football player for &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AReal%20Madrid"&gt;Real Madrid&lt;/a&gt; football club, has announced he no longer wishes to be the captain of England's football team. After the teams loss to Portugal in yesterday's (1 July 2006) World Cup quarter-final, Beckham announced at a press conference at the team's training camp in Germany that he stands down from his position of captain immediately but would remain a part of the England team.

"I came to this decision some time ago but I had hoped to announce it on the back of a successful World Cup. Sadly that wasn't to be. This decision has been the most difficult of my career to date. But after discussing it with my family and those closest to me I feel the time is right," he said.

Beckham became the captain in 2000 by caretaker manager Peter Taylor. He had served 58 games of the 92 he has played as the national captain.

Ferrari driver &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Schumacher"&gt;Michael Schumacher&lt;/a&gt; and his teammate &lt;a href="w%3AFelipe%20Massa"&gt;Felipe Massa&lt;/a&gt; won the first and second place on the &lt;a href="w%3AFIA"&gt;FIA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFormula-1"&gt;Formula-1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20United%20States%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;United States Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="w%3AIndianapolis%20Motor%20Speedway"&gt;Indianapolis Motor Speedway&lt;/a&gt;. Schumacher became the winner on this track for the 5-th time.

&lt;a href="w%3ARenault"&gt;Renault&lt;/a&gt; driver &lt;a href="w%3AGiancarlo%20Fisichella"&gt;Giancarlo Fisicella&lt;/a&gt; pushed hard on &lt;a href="w%3AFerrari"&gt;Ferrari's&lt;/a&gt;, but finished third. &lt;a href="w%3AFernando%20Alonso"&gt;Fernando Alonso&lt;/a&gt;, his teammate, was only fifth.

A major incident right after the start terminated the race for a number of drivers, including the only American Formula-1 driver &lt;a href="w%3AScott%20Speed"&gt;Scott Speed&lt;/a&gt; and both the &lt;a href="w%3ATeam%20McLaren"&gt;McLaren&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3AMercedes"&gt;Mercedes&lt;/a&gt; cars of &lt;a href="w%3AKimi%20Raikkonen"&gt;Kimi Raikkonen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJuan-Pablo%20Montoya"&gt;Juan-Pablo Montoya&lt;/a&gt;.

Also tough luck for both &lt;a href="w%3AMidland%20F1%20Racing"&gt;MF1&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3AToyota%20Motor%20Corporation"&gt;Toyota&lt;/a&gt; team drivers, &lt;a href="w%3ATiago%20Monteiro"&gt;Tiago Monteiro&lt;/a&gt;, who collided with Japanese driver &lt;a href="w%3ATakuma%20Sato"&gt;Takuma Sato&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AChristijan%20Albers"&gt;Christijan Albers&lt;/a&gt;, who ended the race due to technical problems.

The &lt;a href="w%3ASudan"&gt;Sudanese&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="w%3AOmar%20al-Bashir"&gt;Omar Hassan al-Bashir&lt;/a&gt; has rejected an &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; offer of up to 17,000 troops to stem the continuing crisis within the country.

Bashir met with the UN Secretary-General &lt;a href="Kofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday at the 7th &lt;a href="w%3AAfrican%20Union"&gt;African Union&lt;/a&gt; Summit being held in the &lt;a href="w%3AGambia"&gt;Gambian&lt;/a&gt; capital &lt;a href="w%3ABanjul"&gt;Banjul&lt;/a&gt;. In a speech to delegates from across the continent, Mr. Annan, who was born in &lt;a href="w%3AGhana"&gt;Ghana&lt;/a&gt;, labeled the &lt;a href="w%3Adarfur"&gt;Darfur&lt;/a&gt; crisis as "one of the worst nightmares in recent history". But Mr. Bashir said he was concerned that a UN mandate would be seen as a "western invasion" that would attract militants and create a situation similar to Iraq.

Kofi Annan said that he hoped dialogue would continue on the issue. The current African Union (AU) force of 7,000 has struggled to maintain order in a country with over 2.5 million displaced citizens. There have also been accusations of rape by AU soldiers inside camps. 

In his &lt;a href="http%3A//www.un.org/apps/sg/sgstats.asp%3Fnid%3D2117"&gt;speech&lt;/a&gt;, Mr Annan praised the progress in development across the continent since 1997 saying,"Despite elections, many Governments continue to suppress opposition parties and a free press. Many continue to exclude certain groups from participation in public life. Many continue to practise or tolerate large scale corruption," in his last address to the AU. 
Also in attendance at the summit was &lt;a href="w%3AHissene%20Habre"&gt;Hissene Habre&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AChad"&gt;Chad&lt;/a&gt;'s leader until 1990. He will face trial in &lt;a href="w%3ASengal"&gt;Senegal&lt;/a&gt;, according to an announcement made Sunday by the Senegalese president &lt;a href="w%3AAbdoulaye%20Wade"&gt;Abdoulaye Wade&lt;/a&gt;.

Habre is accused of human rights abuses during his reign, including 200,000 counts of torture. There has been much wrangling as to who should try the former leader. &lt;a href="w%3ABelgium"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt; initially stepped in to hold the trial, but Mr. Wade agreed with the AU that "Africans must be judged in Africa."

Former president Habre ruled Chad for eight years before being removed after an uprising by current president &lt;a href="w%3AIdriss%20Deby"&gt;Idriss Deby&lt;/a&gt;.

U.S. officials said on Saturday, "Allegations known so far are that two soldiers allegedly raped an Iraqi woman and then allegedly one of the soldiers may have killed four Iraqi civilians located within that residence -- the woman, two other adults and a child." An official also said that investigators believe that American soldiers spent almost a week planning the attack before they raped an Iraqi woman and then murdered her and her family. 

Apparently the allegations surfaced when an enlisted soldier disclosed he had heard that soldiers from his unit might have taken part in a rape and murder in March.

Investigators then "followed up and they interviewed a second soldier who said, 'Yes, I heard something similar,' ... but in the version he had heard, that the soldier or soldiers had returned from the alleged crime with blood on their uniforms," the U.S. official said.

Capt. Ihsan Abdul-Rahman, a local Iraqi police official, said a report on March 13 alleged that American soldiers had killed the family in the Khasir Abyad district but that he did not relay that report to American forces.

Al-Jazeera gave extensive coverage to the rape and murder allegations and one of the U.S. forces officials told The Associated Press that gasoline or lighter fluid was used to burn the woman's body in a cover-up attempt.

The U.S. official said at least four soldiers are being investigated while two other U.S. officials said on Friday that five were under investigation with one already having been discharged for unspecified charges unrelated to the killings and was believed to have returned to the United States.

A U.S. military statement issued in Baghdad said that the army was investigating an incident in which soldiers "allegedly killed a family of four Iraqi civilians in their home in the area of Mahmudiyah, south of Baghdad. A preliminary inquiry conducted found sufficient information existed to recommend a criminal investigation into the incident," the military said, adding that the "CID investigation began on June 24, and is ongoing."

U.S. Major General James Thurman said: "We are all about values, we are about standards in our military and our soldiers are disciplined, and I know that our commanders are constantly reiterating those type of things." 

The U.S. military is also investigating allegations that US marines killed 24 civilians, including 10 women and children, in the Euphrates valley town of Haditha last year. In addition, two US soldiers were charged last week with voluntary manslaughter for the killing of an unarmed Iraqi civilian outside his home. And this month a sailor and seven marines were charged with premeditated murder, kidnapping, and other offenses for the killing of a reportedly handicapped Iraqi in the town of Hamdania near Baghdad in April.

Major General Thurman said soldiers under his command had recently participated in a "values training" program.

Presidential candidate &lt;a href="w%3AFelipe%20Calder%C3%B3n"&gt;Felipe Calderón&lt;/a&gt; was declared the winner of a close race on Thursday in the &lt;a href="w%3AMexican%20general%20election%2C%202006"&gt;Mexican general election&lt;/a&gt;. The leading rival candidate, &lt;a href="w%3AAndr%C3%A9s%20Manuel%20L%C3%B3pez%20Obrador"&gt;Andrés Manuel López Obrador&lt;/a&gt;, did not concede and said that he would mobilize public rallies and seek to contest the results in court.

Both leading &lt;a href="w%3AMexico"&gt;Mexican&lt;/a&gt; presidential candidates earlier proclaimed victory in the Mexican presidential race despite notice from Mexico's &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Electoral%20Institute"&gt;Federal Electoral Institute&lt;/a&gt; (IFE) that the numbers were too close to determine the winner. Poll workers began a recount of vote tallies Wednesday.

By Thursday morning, with 98% of the vote tallies recounted, Calderón held a lead of less than one percent over López Obrador. In accordance with Mexican electoral law, workers counted the tallies attached to ballot boxes at polling stations, but did not open properly sealed and tallied ballot boxes. 

Citing irregularities and a decision to nullify 904,000 ballots that poll officials deemed unclearly marked, López Obrador has called for a full vote-by-vote recount. 

Questions were raised about the vote count after discrepancies were noticed in the counting. While some of López Obrador's supporters have alleged manipulation of the counting process, López Obrador himself has discounted the possibility of outright fraud and international election observers have said that the election was transparent and largely free of problems. 

The interior minister, Carlos Abascal, has said that a total recount is "physically impossible and also legally impossible." However, reports from every voting booth filled by representatives of all parties have already been distributed to the contenders.

Now that the final count is complete, Mexico's Federal Electoral Tribunal of seven judges can hear complaints and consider overturning the election. It must declare a winner by September 6, 2006.

A 15-year-old, whose name has not been released for legal reasons, is in court charged with murder after he dropped an eight-kilogram concrete block on a car and killed the driver. 

&lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Currie"&gt;Christopher Currie&lt;/a&gt; was driving along &lt;a href="w%3AAuckland"&gt;Auckland&lt;/a&gt;'s southern motorway in a Honda Civic car last August when the concrete block smashed through the windscreen killing him instantly.

"[The] accused stood on the over bridge and timed the release of the concrete block to hit a car passing underneath" prosecutor Aaron Perkins told the High Court. The accused was positioned so that the driver was unable to see them and take evasive action. They later ran from the scene of the crime and bragged to friends about it.

The defence says that the accused did not mean to murder anyone.

There were three other passengers in the car which the Crown is scheduled to call on to give evidence, along with 33 other witnesses.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Jersey"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
Numerous non-essential state services have ceased operation indefinitely from &lt;a href="w%3AJuly%201"&gt;July 1&lt;/a&gt;. These include road work, the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Jersey%20Lottery"&gt;New Jersey Lottery&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="w%3AMotor%20Vehicle%20Commission"&gt;Motor Vehicle Commission&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href="w%3AAtlantic%20City%2C%20New%20Jersey"&gt;Atlantic City&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Acasino"&gt;casinos&lt;/a&gt; and racetracks (which require state monitoring) and public beaches and parks closing from &lt;a href="w%3AJuly%205"&gt;July 5&lt;/a&gt;.

As a result of Article VIII, Section II, paragraph 2 of the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Jersey%20State%20Constitution"&gt;New Jersey State Constitution&lt;/a&gt;, the state is required to determine all debts for "as far as can be ascertained or reasonably foreseen" and provide for them in a single budget act. As the 2005-2006 Fiscal Year for the state ended with &lt;a href="w%3AJune%2031"&gt;June 31&lt;/a&gt; and the 2006-2007 budget has not passed the state is blocked from expending any money, also by VIII, II, 2. The current ascertainment shows the state ending up &lt;a href="wikt%3Ain%20the%20red"&gt;in the red&lt;/a&gt; by 4.5 billion &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;USD&lt;/a&gt;.

The main cause of the problem is a furious deadlock between the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Jersey%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;Democratic&lt;/a&gt; majority is the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Jersey%20General%20Assembly"&gt;New Jersey General Assembly&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3Alower%20house"&gt;lower house&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Jersey%20Legislature"&gt;New Jersey Legislature&lt;/a&gt;, which is given the power of starting the budget, and the Democratic &lt;a href="w%3AGovernor%20of%20New%20Jersey"&gt;Governor of New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJon%20Corzine"&gt;Jon Corzine&lt;/a&gt;. The main concern is Corzine's plan to raise taxes, such as the sales tax. The Assembly majority dislikes this and some in the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Jersey%20Senate"&gt;New Jersey Senate&lt;/a&gt;, which has the power to block the budget, also disagree with his measure.

Originally the racetracks were to close with the state lottery, however a court order has kept them running past the 4th. The casinos attempted to get a similar exemption, but that was definitively rejected by the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Jersey%20Supreme%20Court"&gt;New Jersey Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt;. "Critical" services like the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Jersey%20State%20Police"&gt;New Jersey State Police&lt;/a&gt;, the state's prisons, and hospitals will continue to operate without funding. All non-essential employees of the state were given leave from July 1 on.

All 12 casinos in Atlantic City locked their doors for the first time in the 28-year history of legalized gambling in New Jersey. Casino inspectors, who are state employees, are no longer working. While the casino floor is shut down, many casinos have remained open for hotel, restaurant, and entertainment business.

Members of both houses of the Legislature have been kept in the capital, &lt;a href="w%3ATrenton"&gt;Trenton&lt;/a&gt;, to help a speedy passage.

A similar situation occurred in &lt;a href="w%3AMinnesota"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; exactly one year ago as the Legislature failed to pass the budget before they were forced to adjourn by a hard-wired date in the &lt;a href="w%3Astate%20constitution"&gt;state constitution&lt;/a&gt;.

Amateur filmmaker Solomon Rothman has released a full-length open source movie called 'Boy Who Never Slept.' 

The movie is offered under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-ShareAlike 2.5 license; this allows people to use, edit, or share the movie in any way (except commercially) as long as they credit the creators.

All of the raw unedited footage, including audio files, is offered under a Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 license; as long as the creators are credited, users can do whatever they want with the files privately or commercially. 

The &lt;a href="w%3AOpen_source_movie_production"&gt;open source movie&lt;/a&gt; and original files are available for free download or streaming from a variety of sources, including direct downloading from the Internet Movie Archives, video distribution sites like Google video and Veoh, via &lt;a href="w%3Afile%20sharing%20network"&gt;file sharing network&lt;/a&gt;s like BitTorrent, and more. The full list is found on the official movie website.

The film centers on the life of an insomniac writer who meets a teenage girl online, and a friendship that grows into an unlikely love story wrapped in harsh reality. The movie deals with various issues, including the romanticization of love, age-related issues in relationships, like statutory rape (he's 23, and she's 16), and the idea of love in the online realm.

Rothman, a writer, amateur filmmaker and web designer, lives in the Los Angeles Area. He wrote, directed and produced the movie with his partner, A. Brown. Producing the movie for $200 while they were in college, they used friends as actors and later sold the camera on eBay to recoup the expense.

Rothman has spoken about the importance of exploring new possibilities in film making, especially for amateur filmmakers, “I believe that everyone has the ability to tell at least one good story and I wanted the world to see the power of the Internet Community as a distribution source for amateur filmmakers. I released “Boy Who Never Slept” as an open source movie to encourage new filmmakers and to reach the largest possible audience on a budget absolutely anyone could afford.” 

The movie is unrated; it explores adult themes and contains graphic language and brief nudity.

A house in Eglinton, a village suburb of &lt;a href="w%3ABathurst%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Bathurst&lt;/a&gt; in Central-Western &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; has been significantly damaged after being hit by a truck just before 3 p.m. today. It is not known if anyone was inside the house at the time the accident occurred. Police said no major injuries were sustained as a result of the accident.

The accident occurred in light rain and the road surface was moderately wet.

It is believed that the truck was traveling along Eleven Mile Drive, Eglinton when a Subaru Forester pulled into its path from a side street. The Subaru had been required to give way to the truck. The truck struck the Subaru, hitting it and pushing it down the road before losing control and hitting a house on the opposite side of the road.

The driver of the truck was trapped inside his vehicle for around 15 minutes before being released by rescue personnel, the driver of the Subaru was taken by ambulance to the Bathurst Base Hospital to ensure they were not suffering any major injuries.

When the truck hit the house, a &lt;a href="w%3ANatural%20gas"&gt;gas&lt;/a&gt; line was ruptured creating a hazard for rescue crews. The pipeline's operator - Agility disconnected the line after the truck driver was rescued. Police also requested that electricity to the house be disconnected.

It was not until 4:15 p.m. that approval was given for the truck to be pulled from the house. It is expected that engineers from Bathurst Regional Council will inspect the house to determine if it is still structurally safe.

While it is not unusual in Bathurst for trucks to hit homes, it is unusual for such an accident to occur at this location. Most accidents of this nature occur on the &lt;a href="w%3AGreat%20Western%20Highway"&gt;Great Western Highway&lt;/a&gt;, which intersects the city and is a freight gateway to the region.

At least 43 people have died and at least 46 injured, 4 of whom are in critical condition, in a &lt;a href="w%3Arapid%20transit"&gt;metro&lt;/a&gt; train crash in Spanish city of &lt;a href="w%3AValencia%2C%20Spain"&gt;Valencia&lt;/a&gt;, according to the regional government. 

It has been reported that two of the carriages have derailed and overturned, leading to the evacuation of 150 passengers. 

A part of the wall in the tunnel between the Plaza de España and Jesús stations in the southwestern neighborhood of Patraix may have collapsed, causing the derailment of one of the carriages, which in turn caused the carriage behind it to overturn.

Another theory put forth by subdelegate of the regional government Luis Felipe Martínez is that the wheels on one of the carriages fell off while the train was speeding. The same source has also confirmed that there are two overturned carriages.

The fire department, paramedics and local police are on the scene after a passenger in the crashed train called the emergency services at about 1:03 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3ACentral_European_Summer_Time"&gt;CEST&lt;/a&gt; (1103 &lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated_Universal_Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;). The authorities have closed the area to all road traffic and routes 1 and 2 of the Valencia metro system, which use the affected rail tracks, are shut down.

The incident comes days before Pope Benedict XVI was due to visit Valencia for the World Meeting of the Families, expected to be attended by one million pilgrims.

A rooftop protest at a &lt;a href="w%3ADevon"&gt;Devon&lt;/a&gt; (UK) jail has ended peacefully after almost 28 hours.

The protest, involving 10 inmates, at &lt;a href="w%3AChannings%20Wood"&gt;HMP Channings Wood&lt;/a&gt; started after prisoners complained their meals were being prepared by sex offenders. 

The category C training prison in Newton Abbot, Devon presently holds 663 inmates, with units dedicated to sex offenders and drug offenders.

A &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom%20Home%20Office"&gt;Home Office&lt;/a&gt; spokesman said: "The rooftop protest at HMP Channings Wood has ended peacefully with no injuries to prisoners or prison staff." 

&lt;a href="w%3AHM%20Prison%20Service"&gt;The Prison Service&lt;/a&gt; has so far refused to confirm the extent of the damage done during the protest, but it is believed to run into thousands of pounds with glass being smashed and paving slabs being torn up.

Earlier on Monday afternoon three prisoners had already given up their protest, leaving ten remaining on the roof. They eventually came down at around 6:30 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3ABritish_Summer_Time"&gt;BST&lt;/a&gt; after speaking with trained negotiators.

The Prison Service has launched an internal enquiry into the protest.

Israel fired a missile into northern Gaza Strip, killing one person and wounding two. The Israeli army claimed it targeted militants placing explosives in an area close to Israeli troops.

Palestinian security sources also said the Islamic University, a Hamas stronghold, in Gaza city were hit with no word of any casualties.

The strikes were a part of an Israeli operation in Gaza to rescue Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier kidnapped earlier by Palestinian militants.

&lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; officials decided late Monday to go ahead with the planned launch at 2:38 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3AEastern_Daylight_Time"&gt;EDT&lt;/a&gt; on July 4 of the space shuttle &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Discovery"&gt;Discovery&lt;/a&gt;. The launch, from &lt;a href="w%3ACape%20Canaveral"&gt;Cape Canaveral&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AFlorida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, had previously been delayed twice due to poor weather conditions. The expected 13-day mission has been described as critical to the future of the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Space%20Station"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt; (ISS) as well as the shuttle and the entire NASA fleet.

There were concerns over a 5" by 1/2" crack in the insulation foam that was found late last night. NASA officials dismissed the crack saying it was less than the size required to cause damage at launch. 

The Discovery mission is to deliver critical supplies to the ISS, test shuttle-inspection techniques and to drop off &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Space%20Agency"&gt;European Space Agency&lt;/a&gt; astronaut &lt;a href="w%3AThomas%20Reiter"&gt;Thomas Reiter&lt;/a&gt; for his 6-month stay in the ISS.

Over the last three years, NASA has spent an estimated $1.3 billion to remedy the foam problem. When asked about the foam concern, NASA Associate Administrator &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Gerstenmaier"&gt;Bill Gerstenmaier&lt;/a&gt; said, "We're about the same risk as we were before ... I don't think we're taking any additional risks." Officials have said that they expect foam to fall during the launch though. A few senior NASA safety and technical officers have their voiced opposition to the launch, claiming that they need more time to work on the foam-shedding problem. Foam debris coming loose was the cause of the &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Columbia%20disaster"&gt;Columbia disaster&lt;/a&gt; in 2003. 

It is widely expected that another major problem with the launch would lead to the entire NASA fleet being grounded. A grounded fleet, in turn, will put the $100 billion International Space Station in a difficult situation, since the shuttle has been the major means of delivering supplies to it. 

This mission is to be one of the last few flights of the space shuttle &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Discovery"&gt;Discovery&lt;/a&gt;, which is set to retire in 2010.

Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt; is currently at the top of charts for &lt;a href="w%3AiTunes"&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt;. The PM tops the list of the most downloaded podcasts at the on-line iTunes music store.

The Harper podcasts are speeches, rather than songs. Since April 4 the speeches can be downloaded for free. While the speeches are available on the &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Tory party&lt;/a&gt;'s website, putting them on iTunes has reverberated through cyberspace. 

"Refusing to speak to the media, refusing to answer the tough question, but releasing canned speeches? What country is this? China? iTunes should be ashamed of distributing state-sponsored propaganda," wrote the Devil's Advocate.

But some people think that Harper has an idea. People say that they would probably download Harper.

The &lt;a href="w%3AOffice%20of%20the%20Prime%20Minister%20%28Canada%29"&gt;Prime Minister's Office&lt;/a&gt; said that they do not spend a dime on the podcasts, which are simply computer files of the speeches. An official said the Prime Minister's Office records all the speeches for the archives and then only has to flip a copy to iTunes. "We recognize the fact that the media environment is changing and we want to find ways to communicate directly with Canadians," said a PMO (Prime Minister's Office) official.

"Politicians are historically quick to ride new media. He said the Tories under John Diefenbaker were the first to exploit television in Canadian politics." said &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Ottawa"&gt;University of Ottawa&lt;/a&gt; political historian Michael Behiels. "This is part and parcel of having brought in a younger generation of business-oriented Conservatives," he said. "The Conservatives are leading the way the other parties will soon have to catch up."

<h2>How It works</h2>

You can download them individually or buy the whole album.

A lot of the tunes start off the same way, they are in French or English. Things like:

"Mr. Speaker, thank you." 

"Thank you, thank you very much honoured head guests of the head table and the members and sponsor of the Indo-&lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Chamber%20of%20Commerce"&gt;Canadian Chamber of Commerce&lt;/a&gt;." 

"Well, thank you very much, David, for that introduction ... I want to thank &lt;a href="w%3ACanWest"&gt;CanWest&lt;/a&gt;." 

"Thank you very much, good morning." 

Harper mixes it up. There are a few iTunes in French, a few in English and every one is a live performance. 

He even shares the bill with Gov. General. &lt;a href="w%3AMichaelle%20Jean"&gt;Michaelle Jean&lt;/a&gt;.

There are 17 iTunes altogether.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia's&lt;/a&gt; Federal Communications Minister, Senator Helen Coonan said on Monday that Australia's media watchdog would be handing a report into an alleged sexual misconduct incident which occurred on the set of &lt;a href="w%3ABig%20Brother%20%28Australia%29"&gt;Big Brother&lt;/a&gt; on July 1. The incident was not broadcast on television but was streamed across the &lt;a href="w%3AInternet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt;.

The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) are investigating the incident to determine if a breach of Australian online content laws occurred. The show's website streams footage from the house over the Internet 24 hours a day to subscribers aged 18 and over.

Senator Coonan assured the public that the incident would not be broadcast on television. "I have sought and obtained an undertaking from Channel 10 that they will not broadcast or promote this incident. However, prior to this undertaking, footage of the incident had already been streamed on the Internet to a limited audience via a paid service which is restricted to subscribers over the age of 18," she said.

Senator Coonan said the ACMA would investigate the Internet broadcast and hand down a report today. Under the Australian Broadcasting Services Act, 1992, it is illegal for content which would be refused classification or given a rating of X18+ to be broadcast via the Internet. 

The communications minister said she was also concerned that media outlets provided access to footage of the incident on their websites. "I have asked that AMCA also assess this distribution of the material, and I have written to the media outlets in question this afternoon requesting that they immediately remove the material pending ACMA's findings," she said.

Despite Channel Ten being barred from showing the footage, both Channel 7 and Channel 9 have aired footage of the incident.

Forum users on the Big Brother fan site - Behind Big Brother seem to be split on the incident. Forum users said they thought the media had hyped the incident. "The way it was described in the papers I pictured Camilla really being pinned down and struggling with Ashley having his way with her. In reality it was much more light-hearted and foreshadowed before it occurred. If that happened to me I wouldn't class that as sexual assault, but maybe a little annoyed!" they said.

Another user said that the behaviour was unacceptable. "I've seen it and I still think it is unacceptable behaviour. I don't care how much she was laughing before and after. Young girls need to know that that is not acceptable, they don't have to laugh along with it if their mates are doing it to them." they said.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=New%20Zealand%20diplomats%3A%20Fiat%20using%20Maori%20haka%20in%20television%20ad%20is%20insensitive&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
Italian car company, &lt;a href="w%3AFiat"&gt;Fiat&lt;/a&gt;, has used the &lt;a href="w%3AHaka"&gt;haka&lt;/a&gt; to advertise its new car and New Zealand diplomats says it is culturally insensitive. The ads have gone to air in &lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; and are viewable on their website.

The ad features woman wearing black and performing the haka: &lt;a href="w%3AKa%20Mate%20haka"&gt;Ka Mate&lt;/a&gt;, which was written by the chief of &lt;a href="w%3ANg%C4%81ti%20Toa"&gt;Ngāti Toa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATe%20Rauparaha"&gt;Te Rauparaha&lt;/a&gt;. It is also the haka that is performed before every rugby game played by the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; team, &lt;a href="w%3AAll%20Blacks"&gt;All Blacks&lt;/a&gt;.

The women perform the haka beside the new Fiat car and crowd noise is in the background to simulate the atmosphere in an All Blacks rugby match. As the haka is finished a woman drives away in the Fiat car and a boy in the back of the car pokes out his tongue, which is the action used to finish the haka.

The New Zealand &lt;a href="w%3AMinistry%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%20and%20Trade%20%28New%20Zealand%29"&gt;Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade&lt;/a&gt; (MFAT) said that they were told in April that an advertising company was planning to use the haka. Yesterday (July 3) Brad Tattersfield, a spokesman for MFAT, said "at the time we advised the advertising company that the use of Ka Mate in this way was culturally insensitive and inappropriate. MFAT advised the advertisers to either use a Maori group or a haka composed for women. However, the advertising company indicated they were proceeding despite this advice."

Garry Nicholas, general manager of Te Toi Aoteroa, which promotes and protects Maori art and culture, said that he felt mixed feelings about the ad. "This isn't a haka in my view but is certainly based on haka. It's meant to be in fun and the little boy poking his tongue at the end of the clip makes that very clear."

Heavy rainfall continued in the city of &lt;a href="w%3AMumbai"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; for the fourth consecutive day today, leading to water-logging in many areas of India's commercial capital and leading to the disruption of road and rail traffic. Operations at the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport have been affected and many incoming flights are being diverted to either Ahmedabad or Goa. Those planes that are taking off are doing so 30-45 minutes behind schedule owing to poor visibility. Local commuter trains on the Western Line are running up to half-an-hour late while the Central and Harbour Lines have been shut down due to water-logging.

Vehicular traffic has been hit hard as several arterial roads in the city have been immersed in waist-deep water. S.V Road has been closed to commuters at this point, and cars are being diverted to Linking Road. Dahisar, Goregaon, Andheri, Khar, Hind Mata and the Milan Subway have also been flooded. There are huge traffic jams in several parts of the city and Mumbai Police Commissioner A.N.Roy has asked citizens to avoid going outdoors unless absolutely necessary. Suburbs in the north of Mumbai, from Borivali to Virar, have been the worst hit. Schools and junior colleges have been asked to declare a holiday. The first year junior college admissions, which were supposed to have taken place today, have been postponed till tomorrow. 

The &lt;a href="w%3APowai%20Lake"&gt;Powai Lake&lt;/a&gt; has begun to overflow and the &lt;a href="w%3AMithi%20River"&gt;Mithi River&lt;/a&gt; is fast reaching its danger-mark, which is a cause of great concern for the municipal corporation, which has rushed rescue teams to low-lying areas. The Meteorological Department, which recorded 121 mm of rainfall at the Colaba Observatory and 152 mm of rain at the Santacruz Observatory, has predicted more heavy rainfall over the next 72 hours. Last July, Mumbai was hit by 944 mm of rainfall in one day, a deluge in which hundreds were killed and the entire city was in a state of disarray for a week. Meteorologists however insist the present situation is much smaller in scale than the calamity of 26/7 last year.

According to a maritime regulator, &lt;a href="w%3Apirates"&gt;pirates&lt;/a&gt; have attacked two &lt;a href="w%3AUN"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt;-contracted ships in the &lt;a href="w%3AMalacca%20Strait"&gt;Malacca Strait&lt;/a&gt;.

Reports say that no personnel on the ships were harmed, but the pirates took money and building materials belonging to the UN's &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Food%20Programme"&gt;World Food Programme&lt;/a&gt;.

Noel Choong, of the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Maritime%20Bureau"&gt;International Maritime Bureau&lt;/a&gt;’s piracy centre in &lt;a href="w%3AMalaysia"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;, said the two ships were sailing from &lt;a href="w%3ASumatra"&gt;Sumatra&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3AAceh"&gt;Aceh&lt;/a&gt; when the pirates struck. "The attacks took place not far apart from each other. There is a possibility that they were carried out by the same pirates," Mr Choong revealed.

The attacks have boosted fears that piracy is escalating in the area. "We hope the two attacks are isolated incidents and not a start of more attacks," Mr Choong added. 

The Malacca Strait is one of the busiest sea lanes in the world, and for centuries, piracy has been a notorious threat in the Strait.

In 2005, Malaysia, &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASingapore"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt; announced they would start air patrols in a bid to tackle the threat from piracy.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; police fraud squad have been recognised for their efforts and successes in credit and debit card fraud in &lt;a href="w%3ASingapore"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt; last week according to a statement issued today. The award was presented at the Visa Asia Pacific Risk Management Conference.

The award recognises efforts made by police to reduce credit card &lt;a href="w%3ACredit_card_fraud%23Skimming"&gt;skimming attacks&lt;/a&gt;. Skimming occurs when either an &lt;a href="w%3AAutomatic%20Teller%20Machine"&gt;ATM&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3APoint%20of%20Sale"&gt;merchant's terminal&lt;/a&gt; is modified to record a copy of a customer's card. This data is then sold on the black market.

The award received by NSW police was one of three presented at the conference. The National Police Agency of &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; and the Economic Crime Investigation Departments of Shenzhen and Guandong Provinces of &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; were also acknowledged with awards.

Assistant Commissioner Graeme Morgan from the State Crime Command said the award recognised the amount of work done by the squad in reducing credit card fraud. "The effectiveness of the squad is demonstrated by the results achieved by these detectives, who are amongst the best in the world," he said.

Detective Superintendent Colin Dyson, Commander of the fraud squad applauded his team for receiving the award. "It's a reflection of the enthusiastic and thorough work being carried out by the squad's detectives to dismantle organised crime groups, particularly recent strike forces that have led to significant arrests for credit card counterfeiting and skimming offences."

Visa's Executive Vice President for Australia and New Zealand, Bruce Mansfield, said that NSW Police play a key role in reducing credit card fraud in Australia. "In Australia, we are fortunate to have the best per-capita card security surveillance systems in the world and this is matched by a strong commitment from law enforcement agencies to fight and track down those trying to defraud the system."

"NSW Police exemplifies this commitment with dedicated strike forces focusing on organised crime gangs, both local and international. It is playing a critical role in the dismantling of organised crime groups engaged in credit and debit card skimming," Mr Mansfield said.

A doctor, his assistant and three women who were found to have undergone &lt;a href="w%3Aabortion"&gt;abortion&lt;/a&gt; were convicted of violating abortion laws in &lt;a href="w%3APortugal"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt;. 

The three women were found to have undergone abortion in violation of Portuguese law. Abortion is illegal in Portugal except where a pregnancy is caused by rape or when the health of the mother is in danger due to the pregnancy. Further, abortion cannot be performed after the first trimester (the end of 12th week).

Twelve other defendants, mostly women and their partners, were found not guilty. The doctor was sentenced to 3 years and 8 months in prison. His assistant was deemed an accomplice and sentenced to 1 year and 4 months in prison. The three women were given 6 month suspended sentences.

All the defendants had earlier been acquitted of the charges in 2004 for lack of evidences. That decision was declared void by a superior court on appeal. The court decided that the medical examinations conducted on the women, which were performed without a court order or the presence of a state witness, were legal.

A bomb scare caused an evacuation of &lt;a href="w%3ADublin%20Airport"&gt;Dublin Airport&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday afternoon. The scare reportedly was caused by a man who walked into the arrivals area claiming he was carrying a bomb. The man was later apprehended by the &lt;a href="w%3AGarda%20S%C3%ADoch%C3%A1na"&gt;Gardaí&lt;/a&gt;. The airport main building was closed for passengers for two hours, but flights were continuing to land.

&lt;br style="clear:both;"&gt;

The &lt;a href="w%3A%20Chinese_Government"&gt;Chinese Government&lt;/a&gt; has announced plans to impose fines of over US$12,000 on media outlets if they report domestic disasters without permission. 

Two years in the planning, the law is expected to be in force by the end of the year and would affect reporting of natural and industrial disasters or anything that could “jeopardize the handling of emergencies,” or threaten social order. 

In a country which is infamous for its censorship there’s been outcry from press freedom campaign groups, but the Chinese government insist that the laws are primarily to give local governments more control in releasing information to the public. A government spokesperson said: "Journalists and media organisations have worked very hard to contribute to covering emergencies but I must say that some individual journalists have filed wrong reports or even fabricated facts."

Chinese journalists on the mainland &lt;a href="w%3A%20Hong_Kong"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt; have criticised the law, calling it a “step backward.” The Xin Kuaibao (New Express) said it was concerned that local government would control information saying “there is no way of verifying that the information in the hands of the government is the truest and most accurate.” 

The &lt;a href="w%3A%20Committee_to_Protect_Journalists"&gt;Committee to Protect Journalists&lt;/a&gt; (CPJ) meanwhile has expressed its concern. "The media have an important and potentially life-saving role in reporting health crises, natural disasters and other incidents of public concern that officials often have an interest in concealing," CPJ director Ann Cooper said last week. 

The proposed law is a worry for some in light of the Chinese government’s handling of previous disasters that were widely criticised. In 2004 several officials resigned for their handling of the &lt;a href="w%3A%20Progress_of_the_SARS_outbreak"&gt;SARS outbreak&lt;/a&gt;, after public pressure sparked by domestic media. 

According to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; imprisons more journalists than any other country, including two from the Southern Metropolis News for their reportage of the SARS crisis.

The has been launched from Kennedy Space Center, on mission . This is 115th Space Shuttle Flight and the second since the loss of &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Columbia"&gt;Space Shuttle Columbia&lt;/a&gt; on February 1, 2003.

The ascent was described as "smooth", however NASA engineers will be looking for traces of damage to the shuttle's heat shield that may be caused by foam falling from the external tank.

Launch occurred on schedule at 2:38 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Daylight%20Time"&gt;EDT&lt;/a&gt; (18:38 &lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated%20Universal%20Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;), with the spacecraft reaching orbit 8 minutes later.

Around 3 minutes into the launch, an on-board camera showed numerous pieces of insulation foam break away from the fuel tank. However, they are not thought to have caused any damage to the shuttle. NASA's shuttle program chief N. Wayne Hale Jr. said the foam had fallen "after the time we are concerned about."

This is the first time an American manned spacecraft has added its own launch fireworks to &lt;a href="w%3AIndependence%20Day%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Fourth of July&lt;/a&gt; celebrations in the United States.

<h1>Switzerland accuses Israel of breaking international law in Gaza</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Switzerland%20accuses%20Israel%20of%20breaking%20international%20law%20in%20Gaza&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;br style="clear:both;"&gt;

The Swiss government has said Israel has "not taken the precautions required of it in international law" in their offensive in Gaza. The Federal Department of Foreign Affairs believes Israeli actions "are to be seen as forms of collective punishment." 

Israel has said their operation in Gaza is to free a kidnapped Israeli soldier.

Switzerland, the state where the international convention on human rights, the &lt;a href="w%3AGeneva%20Conventions"&gt;Geneva Conventions&lt;/a&gt;, were signed, claims it is neutral in international affairs. 

The rules, which Switzerland say Israel has broken, prohibit the deliberate targeting of services, including water and electricity, which are essential to the civilian population. On June 28 Israeli forces destroyed a power station that provided most of the power to residents of the &lt;a href="w%3AGaza%20Strip"&gt;Gaza Strip&lt;/a&gt;.

"There is no doubt that Israel has not taken the precautions required of it in international law to protect the civilian population and infrastructure," said a Swiss Foreign Ministry Spokesman 

"The destruction of a power station, the attack on the offices of the Palestinian prime minister, the arbitrary arrests of a large number of democratically-elected representatives of the people and ministers... cannot be justified," he continued.

The Israeli ambassador to Switzerland in Bern, Aviv Shir-On, replied to the Switzerland statement. "We are disappointed that the Swiss government did not issue such statements when Israel's civilian population was constantly under attack from the Gaza Strip," he said.

It is not the only time the Swiss government has commented in the midst of Middle Eastern turmoil.

Earlier this year, the 2006 Swiss President &lt;a href="w%3AMoritz%20Leuenberger"&gt;Moritz Leuenberger&lt;/a&gt; said the international block on funding to the Palestinian authority was a mistake, a claim Israel rejected.

Leuenberger said that the newly elected Hamas government should have been given the chance to prove it could work, a statement echoed by some aid agencies. Israel, the EU, and the United States have described Hamas as a terrorist organisation.
<h3>Humanitarian concerns</h3>
The statement from Switzerland comes amid concern among aid agencies at the humanitarian situation in Gaza. UNICEF have said there have been elevated levels of stress and trauma in young children.

The &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organization"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; reported that essential medical supplies have run low and doctors and nurses have found it hard to get to their workplace. Israel defence forces have put restrictions on movement in Gaza.

These agencies have expressed concern that the military operation by Israel could create serious humanitarian consequences for people living in the region.

The power station that was destroyed by the Israeli forces on June 28 provided 43 per cent of Gaza's electricity. Around 700,000 people have been affected by the power cuts.

Water supplies have also been badly hit as not all water pumps can continue to work normally, and there is a lack of gasoline and other fuels, according to the Swiss government.

In response to the situation, the Swiss government has earmarked one million Swiss Francs for essential medical supplies for the civilian population in Gaza.

Switzerland also gave one million Swiss Francs for medicines in June 2006 through the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC).

A Swiss expert has been deployed to Gaza to ensure the smooth running of the humanitarian operations.

The &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20Korea"&gt;Democratic People's Republic of Korea&lt;/a&gt; (North Korea) has test fired seven ballistic missiles including the long-range &lt;a href="w%3ATaepodong-2"&gt;Taepodong-2&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday. The tests were criticised by officials from several countries, particularly Japan, Republic of Korea (South Korea) and the United States. The &lt;a href="w%3AUN%20Security%20Council"&gt;UN Security Council&lt;/a&gt; held a closed meeting today to discuss the developments.

A North Korean foreign ministry official, Lee Byong Dok, acknowledged the tests while speaking to reporters in Pyongyang. Japan's NHK television quoted the official as saying, "This is an issue of national sovereignty, and other countries do not have the right to judge. We are not bound by any agreement regarding missiles." North Korean media made no mention of the launches.&lt;a href="http%3A//today.reuters.com/news/newsarticle.aspx%3Ftype%3DtopNews%26amp%3BstoryID%3D2006-07-05T054422Z_01_N04284348_RTRUKOC_0_US-KOREA-NORTH-MISSILE.xml%26amp%3BpageNumber%3D2%26amp%3Bimageid%3D%26amp%3Bcap%3D%26amp%3Bsz%3D13%26amp%3BWTModLoc%3DNewsArt-C1-ArticlePage4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Australian foreign minister Alexander Downer said Wednesday that "there could be one or two more" launches of short or medium-ranged missiles.&lt;a href="http%3A//www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200607/s1680006.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Major South Korean newspaper reported Thursday that Pyongyang got three or four missiles on launch pads. The missiles are thought to be short- or medium-range.&lt;a href="http%3A//news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060706/ap_on_re_as/nkorea_missiles_ready"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The missile launches comes five days after US president George W Bush, after talks with Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, warned North Korea on test-launching a long range missile.&lt;a href="http%3A//www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/dprk/2006/dprk-060629-voa01.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

<h2>The Tests</h2>
The first missile was launched at 3:33 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3AJapan%20Standard%20Time"&gt;JST&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday (1833 &lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated%20Universal%20Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday) and fell into the Sea of Japan, between the Korean peninsula and the Japanese mainland.

According to CNN, at least three missiles were launched including a Taepodong-2, which failed (or was aborted) in less than a minute. The Taepodong-2 is an intercontinental ballistic missile (&lt;a href="w%3AIntercontinental%20ballistic%20missile"&gt;ICBM&lt;/a&gt;) with an estimated range of up to 6,000 km (3,730 miles). This would bring parts of the United States like Alaska and Hawaii within striking range of the missile. The ability to achieve this range has so far not been demonstrated in a test.

A fourth short-range missile was launched at 7:12 a.m. JST (2212 UTC), according to CNN.

Contrary to information given by US officials, Russia says that Pyongyang launched as many as ten missiles yesterday. This was also earlier reported by the South Korean agency Yonhap.

The launch of the seventh missile was reported by &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Korean"&gt;South Korean&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJapanese"&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt; officials on Wednesday. Media reports said the latest launch was at 17:22 &lt;a href="w%3AJapan%20Standard%20Time"&gt;JST&lt;/a&gt;(8:22 &lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated%20Universal%20Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;). The missile landed six minutes after the launch according to Japan's Kyodo News agency.

Two of the missiles were launched from a site other than the one intelligence officials have watched for weeks ahead of a possible long-range missile test, a senior United States State Department official said. Two senior U.S. State Department officials said on Tuesday that fuel trucks had departed the site where the Taepodong-2 sits on a launching pad, indicating that a test may occur in the near future.

The North Korean removal of the fuel trucks and other auxiliary equipment meant the North Koreans may have finished fueling the missile, said the officials, who did not want to be named because of the sensitivity of the information. Should the North Koreans have completed the fueling "all they would need to do now is press the button," one source said.

<h2>Reactions</h2>
The test launches were criticised by many countries and led to an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council the day after the initial launches. 

The US National Security Advisor &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Hadley"&gt;Stephen Hadley&lt;/a&gt; called the test launches "provocative behaviour" and confirmed that the Taepodong-2 went down just 35 seconds after being launched.

"It's the Fourth of July, and they know we are watching and they like to play with us," said one senior US official, who has followed the North Korean program for years.

Japanese and South Korean military have been placed on high alert following the tests. The Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi said that continued talks are needed to defuse the current standoff, adding "We need both pressure and dialogue, ... There will be no solution without dialogue."

&lt;a href="w%3ANORAD"&gt;NORAD&lt;/a&gt; was put on heightened alert in the past two weeks and the U.S. Missile Defense Agency told CNN that two missiles for interception of ballistic missiles were activated in California prior to test launches.

The South Korean Senior Security Secretary, Suh Choo-Suk said that the tests have deepened North Korea's isolation and called for a halt to the "provocative activity" and a return to the six-party talks and international efforts for nuclear non-proliferation, adding "North Korea should be held responsible for all the consequences."

In a closed meeting today Japan, Britain and the United States prepared a UN resolution that demanded that all nations withhold technology, goods and funding that potentially could be used for North Korea's missile program. It also called on the North Korea to immediately stop the development, testing and deployment of ballistic missiles. No voting on the resolution is expected today.

Japan announced Wednesday that they would suspend charter flights between the two countries as well has bringing a ferry service to a six-months halt. This means that the only passenger and trade link would be closed for half a year. The country is also considering a call for sanctions through the UN.

The South Korea has said that that it will withhold 500,000 tons of rice and 100,000 tons of fertilizer aid to their northern neighbours.

The United States, the Republic of Korea and Japan have stressed that the test launches will not bring an end to any diplomatic negotiations.

China, the North Korea's closest ally, called the tests "regrettable", but indicated that they would favor a more lenient UN statement. However, they did not defend the launches in the UN meeting on Wednesday.

Stocks and currencies fell in Asia after the test launches, but investors considered it a short-term impact based on experiences from previous North Korean launches. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.financialexpress-bd.com/index3.asp%3Fcnd%3D7/6/2006%26amp%3Bsection_id%3D7%26amp%3Bnewsid%3D30067%26amp%3Bspcl%3Dno"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

U.S. federal prosecutors have charged a former U.S. soldier who served in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; with the rape and murder of an Iraqi girl and the murder of three members of her family, including the girl's sister believed to be five years old. 
The rape victim, &lt;a href="w%3AAbeer%20Qassim%20Hamza"&gt;Abeer Qassim Hamza&lt;/a&gt;, was 14 years old. Although an FBI affidavit (based on soldiers' accounts) estimated her age to be 25, Reuters obtained documents that gave her date of birth as August 19, 1991. The other victims have been identified as Fikhriya Taha, the girl's mother; her father Qassim Hamza, and her younger sister, Hadeel Qassim Hamza. 

The charges follow a military investigation into the involvement of as many as five soldiers in the rape and murders committed in the town of Mahmoudiya, 30 km south of Baghdad, on March 12. 

&lt;a href="w%3ASteven%20D.%20Green"&gt;Steven D. Green&lt;/a&gt;, a 21-year-old former Army &lt;a href="w%3Aprivate%20first%20class"&gt;private first class&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3A101st%20Airborne%20Division"&gt;101st Airborne Division&lt;/a&gt;, appeared in a federal magistrate's courtroom in &lt;a href="w%3ACharlotte"&gt;Charlotte&lt;/a&gt; on Monday. FBI agents had arrested Green on Friday and he is being held in Charlotte without bond pending a transfer to Louisville, Kentucky. He was honorably discharged from the Army in May 2006 because of an alleged "personality disorder."

In an affidavit, FBI special agent Gregor J. Ahlers said Green and three other soldiers from the 101st's &lt;a href="w%3A502nd%20Infantry%20Regiment"&gt;502nd Infantry Regiment&lt;/a&gt; were on duty at a traffic checkpoint when they conspired to rape the female who lived nearby.

According to witness testimony in the affidavit, the soldiers changed their clothes before going to the victims' home to avoid detection. Green took three members of the family - an adult male and female, and a girl estimated to be 5 years old—into a bedroom. Shots were heard from inside the bedroom.

"Green came to the bedroom door and told everyone, 'I just killed them, all are dead,'" Ahlers wrote in the affidavit.

The affidavit is based on interviews conducted by the &lt;a href="w%3AFBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; and investigators at &lt;a href="w%3AFort%20Campbell"&gt;Fort Campbell&lt;/a&gt; with soldiers assigned to Green's platoon. One of the soldiers said he witnessed Green and another soldier rape the girl.

"After the rape, (the soldier) witnessed Green shoot the woman in the head two-to-three times," the affidavit said.

U.S. officials and others had previously claimed the Iraqi family was killed in sectarian violence. Abeer Hamza's uncle, Ahmed Taha, told AP Television News that the family had believed insurgents had carried out the killings until the US military made public its investigation last week.

"Some said it was insurgents, and in fact, we ruled out the American troops," Taha said.

<h3>Response</h3>

The news of the killings and rape was met with a wave of anger in parts of Iraq and the Iraqi government directed at the nature of the current US military presence. "We believe that the immunity given to members of coalition forces encouraged them to commit such crimes in cold blood (and) that makes it necessary to review it," was the opinion of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki during a visit to Kuwait, July 7.
One Baghdad resident, Hussein al-Shimmari, said that the incident "shows the barbaric and aggressive nature of Americans." The Americans themselves claim they are in Iraq to help the government protect its democracy and are reported to have reviewed the way soldiers deal with Iraqi citizens. 

Gen. George W. Casey Jr., commander of U.S. forces in Iraq and Zalmay Khalilzad, ambassador to Iraq, issued a joint apology Thursday. "We understand this is painful, confusing and disturbing," they said, "not only to the family who lost a loved one, but to the Iraqi people as a whole."

Despite the best attacking efforts from the two teams, the score had remained level during 90 minutes of regulation time and the 28 overtime minutes that preceded the game winner.

Moments after Jens Lehmann had dived to put Andrea Pirlo's 25 yard drive behind for a corner, the German keeper was helpless. With the clock on 119 minutes Fabio Grosso, found in the area by Pirlo, circled a left foot shot across him just inside the far post.

Just two minutes later, Alessandro Del Piero got Italy's second with the last kick of the game when he clipped high past Lehmann's left hand at the end of a fast break-away with Alberto Gilardino.

Lehmann had the busier match and made eight saves while Gianluigi Buffon was troubled by two. The Arsenal goalkeeper had also to deal with twelve corner kicks, many of which he plucked easily from the Italian heads.

Germany played the game without ball winner Torsten Frings, whom FIFA had suspended from the match for a punch thrown in a melee after the penalty shootout in the quarter-final against Argentina. 

In the 90 minutes the better chances fell to Germany. On half an hour Bernd Schneider was free on goal but did not keep his shot down. After an hour Lukas Podolski, right of goal, spun and shot but was denied by Gianluigi Buffon.

The Italian defence had not conceded a goal for four games, and were to go on to record a fifth shut out in six games at the World Cup finals. 

The statistics suggest Italy were the most attacking side in the match with eight more corners, nine more offsides and 14 per cent more ball possession than their opponents.

Italy played overtime with a vigorous intent to win and nearly cracked the Germans in the first two minutes. Gilardino cut back from the goal line and got away a sneaky near post shot but it bounced off the inside of Lehmann's left post. Gianluca Zambrotta drove one from the edge of the area but was denied by Lehmann's crossbar.

The Germans who had gone the full 120 minutes in their last game appeared the more tired team but had a chance to go 1-0 in front. Lukas Podolski was found unmarked at the near post, but his header from ten yards was about ten yards wide.

Italy had an emotional history of penalty kick shootout losses at the World Cup, including a defeat in the 1994 World Cup final, but Marcello Lippi's team's persistence was eventually rewarded. There were no penalties to overcome. Germany has won a total of five World Cup penalty shootouts in a row.

Poland has won in 4th annual Hubert Jerzy Wagner's Volleyball Memorial, after defeating Cuba 3:1 in the final match. Third place has been taken by Canada, and fourth by Italy. Poland B was 6th.

The memorial, which was set up to commemorate Hubert Jerzy Wagner, ex-coach of the most successful Polish national volleyball team in history, who died in a car accident in 2002, was held in both Olsztyn and Ostróda.

Raul Lozano, Polish coach, has said on Tuesday, that the main target for the current season is the World Cup, which will be held in Japan. Judging the appearance in the memorial, Lozano has stated the team has 18 valuable players, of which everyone can be in the starting line-up. He added that the victory is dedicated to Arkadiusz Gołaś, former Polish national team star, who died in car accident about year ago.

&lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; has announced its plans to drop the part of its &lt;a href="w%3AWindows%20Genuine%20Advantage"&gt;Windows Genuine Advantage&lt;/a&gt; (WGA) tool that sends data back to Microsoft saying if the user's copy of &lt;a href="w%3AWindows%20XP"&gt;Windows XP&lt;/a&gt; is genuine or not. There has been a huge amount of controversy over that part of the application, mainly because every time a PC with the software is booted, it sends the data. If the PC, or more accurately, the &lt;a href="w%3AOperating%20system"&gt;operating system&lt;/a&gt; of the PC, is reported to be a &lt;a href="w%3Acopyright%20infringement%20of%20software"&gt;pirated&lt;/a&gt; version the user is presented with numerous pop-ups and icons stating that the PC is running an illegal version of Windows.

The dropping of pirate checks in WGA could be because of a class action lawsuit that was filed last week by San Diego lawyer, Scott Kamber, on behalf of U.S. users on allegations that the software is &lt;a href="w%3Aspyware"&gt;spyware&lt;/a&gt;. 

A statement from Microsoft Australia says, "WGA is not spyware. It's installed with the consent of the user and seeks only to notify the user if a proper licence is not in place."

Ian Smith, a user angered by the WGA pirating checks, said to ♡❤Australian IT♡❤ "I bought my software legitimately, I validated it, I go to Microsoft for updates, and if they want to check it then, that's okay. But coming back every day is too much."

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — &lt;a href="w%3AYell%20Group"&gt;Yell&lt;/a&gt;, the world's biggest yellow pages publisher, today threatened to shut down &lt;a href="w%3AYellowikis"&gt;Yellowikis&lt;/a&gt;, the wiki-based yellow pages directory.

Yell accused Yellowikis co-founders Paul Youlten and his 15 year-old daughter Rosa Blaus of "misrepresentation", "&lt;a href="w%3Apassing%20off"&gt;passing off&lt;/a&gt;" and suggested that using the name ♡❤Yellowikis♡❤ could "constitute an 'instrument of fraud'." ♡❤Passing off♡❤ is defined as misrepresenting a product and ♡❤passing it off♡❤ as one's own. Passing off is a form of trademark infringement.
Yell is demanding that Paul and Rosa close down the website, transfer the domain names to Yell and agree to pay damages to Yell for loss of profits. Yell made $2.4bn in 2005, whereas Yellowikis had a loss of $500. The $500 was used to print T-shirts promoting Yellowikis at the Wikimania conference in Frankfurt.

Paul Youlten said: "This threat from Yell to shut us down looks like a sign of desperation. The whole yellow pages industry is in crisis. Use of the paper directories is collapsing as people get broadband Internet connections in their homes. Small and medium sized businesses are beginning to notice that their customers are ringing them up and saying 'I found you on Google' and not 'I found you in the yellow pages'."

Rosa Blaus said: "Maybe they are a bit jealous of Yellowikis because we allow companies to add videos, &lt;a href="skype"&gt;skype&lt;/a&gt; IDs, email addresses, instant messaging, in as many categories and languages as they like for free." Blaus suggested to her father that they set up Yellowikis after she noticed small businesses were deleted from Wikipedia for not being "encyclopaedic".

Yellowikis has been growing at 8.7% month-on-month and has 494 editors and about 5,000 articles listed.

The threat of legal action came after &lt;a href="http%3A//news.independent.co.uk/media/article1096343.ece"&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; published in ♡❤The Independent♡❤ newspaper mentioned Yellowikis.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia's&lt;/a&gt; media watchdog - the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) has cleared Australian ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABig%20Brother%20%28Australia%29"&gt;Big Brother&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ of breaching content laws following a sexual misconduct scandal, which was broadcast via the &lt;a href="w%3AInternet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt;. The determination has prompted Australia's communications minister, Helen Coonan to request that the ACMA to review the free-to-air television code of conduct and extend content regulation to content streamed via the Internet.

According to Senator Coonan the ACMA found that because Channel Ten did not broadcast the incident on television that the television broadcast standards were inapplicable.

The ACMA also found that despite the video being streamed on the Internet, ♡❤Big Brother♡❤ had not breached online content censorship laws as the media had not been stored on ♡❤Big Brother's♡❤ website. The Broadcasting Services Act provides for the regulation of Internet content, however to be considered Internet content, it must physically reside on a server.

Senator Coonan said that live content distributed via the Internet or mobile devices should be subject to the same restrictions as those on television. “This matter has reinforced the need for changes to the Act to ensure that these new services being offered over the Internet and mobile devices are subject to the same content restrictions that apply to television broadcasts," said the minister.

“On June 14 2006 in an address to the National Press Club I announced that legislation would be introduced to ensure that appropriate content safeguards would be imposed on all non-broadcasting commercial content services, including live services."

“This important legislation is presently being drafted and will be introduced into Parliament at the earliest opportunity. I will be urging all of my Parliamentary colleagues to support the extension of these essential safeguards."

The minister said that she had also requested that the ACMA review the television code of practice. "Given the community outrage about this matter, it would appear the codes applying to television program classifications may also be out of step with community standards," said Senator Coonan.

“I will direct ACMA to conduct a detailed review of whether the free to air television code of practice is operating to provide appropriate community safeguards in relation to reality TV programming."

A &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; scientist has made the world’s smallest &lt;a href="w%3AFootball%20%28soccer%29"&gt;soccer&lt;/a&gt; pitch with &lt;a href="w%3Ananotechnology"&gt;nanotechnology&lt;/a&gt;. The pitch is so small that you could fit 20 000 on the tip of a human hair. 

The simulated soccer playing field measures 500 by 380 &lt;a href="w%3Ametre"&gt;nanometres&lt;/a&gt;. It can only be seen under a special microscope. 

He spent a whole day engraving the lines with an &lt;a href="w%3ACathode%20ray"&gt;electron beam&lt;/a&gt;.

"I am really, really proud," said Stefan Trellenkamp, nanotechnology researcher from the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Kaiserslautern"&gt;University of Kaiserslautern&lt;/a&gt;.

"The only problem is that I really don't know what to do with it. I can't put it on show as no one can see it," he said, "I guess it'll just stay in my drawer for the time being."

&lt;a href="w%3AKen%20Lay"&gt;Kenneth L. Lay&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AEnron"&gt;Enron&lt;/a&gt; ex-chief executive and ex-chair, died early Wednesday morning at his vacation home at the age of 64 after a massive coronary attack, according to a family spokesperson.

Lay was found guilty of six counts of fraud and conspiracy related to the &lt;a href="w%3AEnron%20scandal"&gt;Enron scandal&lt;/a&gt; on May 25, 2006 and convicted on four counts of bank fraud in a separate non-jury trial. He was awaiting a sentencing on October 23 and faced the possibility of spending the rest of his life in prison.

In 2001, Enron went bankrupt with debts of $31.8bn (£18bn), and 4,000 people were left jobless. 

As a result of Lay's death prior to exhausting his appeals, his conviction is abated, and Lay is legally considered never to have been indicted or convicted of criminal charges.

&lt;a href="w%3AMarco%20Mancini"&gt;Marco Mancini&lt;/a&gt;, a director of a division of the &lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASISMI"&gt;SISMI&lt;/a&gt; military intelligence agency has been arrested in Milan over his role in the alleged kidnapping of an Egyptian terrorist suspect by agents of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Intelligence%20Agency"&gt;Central Intelligence Agency&lt;/a&gt; (CIA) in what is believed to be an instance of &lt;a href="w%3AExtraordinary%20Rendition"&gt;Extraordinary Rendition&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AHassan%20Mustafa%20Osama%20Nasr"&gt;Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr&lt;/a&gt;, also known as Abu Omar, is an Egyptian cleric living in Italy who was abducted, allegedly by covert agents of the CIA on February 17, 2003 from Milan and flown to Egypt, where he says he was tortured. 

Italian investigators suspected that Nasr had links with Al Qaeda and say that they were investigating him when he was abducted. 

In June 2005, Italian judge Guido Salvini issued a warrant for the arrest of 22 persons said to be agents or operatives of the CIA over the kidnapping.

The Ministry of Defence has named a British soldier from the 3 Para Battle Group who died while on patrol in &lt;a href="w%3AAfghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href="w%3AHelmand%20Province"&gt;Helmand Province&lt;/a&gt;. 

The soldier, 19 year-old Private Damien Raymond Jackson, of &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Shields"&gt;South Shields&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATyne%20and%20Wear"&gt;Tyne and Wear&lt;/a&gt;, came under fire from &lt;a href="w%3ATaliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt; forces in the town of Sangin. He died while being given treatment. 

His father, Daniel Jackson said: "I wish everyone to know just how extremely proud I am of my son Damien - of all that he has achieved in his lifetime and of the fact that he died, when duty called, protecting others, in the service of his country.

"A fine, upstanding South Shields lad, Damien was immensely proud to have achieved his ultimate ambition in becoming a member of the finest regiment in the British Army." 

He also condemned the government's policy in Afghanistan, saying that UK forces are in "dreadful danger". "We fully support the British Army in Afghanistan whilst in no way supporting or condoning a government policy, which has placed our young men and women in such dreadful danger." 

Private Jackson's death means six British soldiers have died in the unstable Helmand region in the last four weeks. Since 2001 when operations began in Afghanistan, thirteen British soldiers have lost their lives. 

On Saturday, two British soldiers were killed after a rocket-propelled grenade struck the headquarters they were in. 

&lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; said he would give more resources to British troops to assist them in their fight against the Taliban, but he said the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Army"&gt;British Army&lt;/a&gt; has not yet made such a request.

"If they need more, we will make sure that they get more," he told the House of Commons during &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%E2%80%99s%20Questions"&gt;Prime Minister’s Questions&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday. 

Along with the &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party"&gt;Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Cameron"&gt;David Cameron&lt;/a&gt;, Mr Blair also commended the efforts of British soldiers by praising their "extraordinary and heroic job". 

"They are fighting a battle that I think is important not just for the security of Afghanistan. It is important for the security of the wider world," the Prime Minister said.

Approximately 4,000 British soldiers are stationed in Afghanistan, and almost 3,000 of them work in Helmand Province. 

In general, they are in Afghanistan to help train the country's troops, provide security, and assist with reconstruction. As 20% of the world’s opium is produced in Helmand Province, the main task for troops there is to control drugs lords.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AToronto"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
More Grade 11 males at &lt;a href="w%3ADon%20Mills%20Collegiate%20Institute"&gt;Don Mills Collegiate Institute&lt;/a&gt; are proficient in &lt;a href="w%3AKlingon%20language"&gt;Klingon&lt;/a&gt; than &lt;a href="w%3AFrench%20language"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt;, suggests a survey conducted by this reporter.

Of 35 students who completed the survey and indicated that they were male and in Grade 11, only two indicated that they would be able to carry on a conversation, read newspapers and write personal letters in French. Three indicated they could do so in Klingon. (A fourth Klingon-speaker did not indicate gender or grade. No females, or males in other grades, checked off the language.)

The Klingon language was constructed by American language professor &lt;a href="w%3AMarc%20Okrand"&gt;Marc Okrand&lt;/a&gt; for the namesake &lt;a href="w%3AKlingon"&gt;militaristic race of aliens&lt;/a&gt; in the Star Trek TV series. Its vocabulary, like the Klingon culture, focuses on fighting and space travel, and is often found lacking when other topics are discussed. Some &lt;a href="w%3ATrekkie"&gt;devoted fans&lt;/a&gt; of the series learn the language using books written by Okrand, and use it in conversation with other fans, particularly at &lt;a href="w%3Ascience%20fiction%20convention"&gt;science fiction convention&lt;/a&gt;s (which they often attend in costume). Unlike French, however, it is not a language of business, government or scholarly writing anywhere on Earth.

In &lt;a href="w%3AOntario"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt;, students educated primarily in English must take French classes from Grades 4 through 9 to receive their Ontario Secondary School Diplomas. However, transfer students from outside Canada may take only the Grade 9 class. No other languages besides English and French are mandatory.

The sample of Grade 11 males was small and possibly non-representative. Also, students only had to claim, but not demonstrate, their knowledge of a particular language. Therefore, the more‑Klingon‑than‑French result is tentative at best. (Klingon ranks several places behind French if the entire survey group is considered.) However, it underscores a real problem: a dearth of French proficiency in TDSB students and graduates. Only 30% of senior students surveyed say they can speak a basic level of French, and only 30% can read and write French at a basic level.

An experienced French side beat Portugal 1-0 in an unspectacular semi-final of the FIFA World Cup in Munich, Wednesday.

The team that lined up against Luis Felipe Scolari's side had an average age over 30 and after they went ahead from a 32 minute Zinedine Zidane penalty used their experience to control the game.

In the second half French tactics became increasingly defensive which saw ball possession go from a direct split at half time to 59 per cent in favour of Portugal as, at times, every French man sat back in his own half of the pitch. 

There were few good chances in a slow game and in the first half Portugal were particularly guilty of wasting possession near the French box, giving Portugal's only striker Pauleta no chance.

On 23 minutes Cristiano Ronaldo and Luis Figo swapped sides but this did not seem to help. French defending was tight and the majority of shots at goal Portugal got were from long range.

On 38 minutes Ronaldo created the best chance; on the left touchline he got past two French players and ran almost 30 yards into the penalty area. His shot was deflected away by a diving Liliam Thuram challenge.

France were also unable to get a sight of goal, confined to three efforts in the first period, to which they were to add two more in the second. The only goal came from a penalty awarded on the half hour when Thierry Henry wrong-footed Ricardo Carvalho and the Chelsea defender impeded Henry's movement with a leg.

Ricardo had saved three penalties against England in the quarter-final shootout but Zidane's low shot to his right just evaded his finger tips. 

Portugal did not score in their quarter-final and they were not to score in the semi-final. They came closest to scoring on a Fabien Barthez error when the veteran of France's successful 1998 World Cup campaign failed to catch Ronaldo's driven free kick. He somehow managed also to throw the ball onto Figo's head but the Portugal captain did not keep it down.

Two minutes into added time Fernando Miera had a sight of goal at the edge of the French area but the central defender hit the ball high and wide.

It did not seem like a 100 per cent effort from the French team who might be glad that the game did not go to a punishing Extra Time. Italy awaits Raymond Domenech's side in the Olympiastadion, Berlin, on July 9.

The &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraqi&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ANouri%20al-Maliki"&gt;Nouri al-Maliki&lt;/a&gt; said today that immunity from prosecution granted to &lt;a href="w%3AMultinational%20force%20in%20Iraq"&gt;coalition troops&lt;/a&gt; in Iraq has encouraged atrocities. 

"We believe that the immunity given to members of coalition forces encouraged them to commit such crimes in cold blood (and) that makes it necessary to review it," al-Maliki said during a visit to Kuwait. 

He called for either a joint investigation or an independent Iraqi investigation into the March 12 rape and murder of an Iraqi girl, allegedly by US soldiers. The mother, father and 5 year old sister of the girl, were also killed in the attack at their home in the town of Mahmoudiya, south of Baghdad. 

"We are going to demand an independent Iraqi investigation or at least a joint investigation between us and the multinational forces," al-Maliki said.

U.S. Maj.-Gen. William Caldwell said the coalition would discuss the prime minister's demands. 

"We are here as guests of the Iraqi government. They are a sovereign nation. When the prime minister gets back, the coalition will engage with him and discuss what he wants to discuss.” Caldwell said.

Three people have been charged in the United States for trying to sell Coca-Cola trade secrets to PepsiCo. The main suspect, administration worker Joya Williams, tried to sell documents and a liquid sample of a new Coca-Cola product to the rival, prosecutors said.

When being offered to buy the trade secrets in May, PepsiCo immediately contacted the FBI. A person calling himself "Dirk" wanted to meet a PepsiCo representative at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta in June. Instead, an undercover FBI agent met with Ibrahim Dimson, the man posing as "Dirk".

During the meeting it is said the undercover agent gave Dimson $30,000 for the trade secrets and promised to pay an additional $45,000 later. Then later that month, another agent later offered to buy the remaining trade secrets for $1.5m. The same day the suspects were arrested.

A third person, Edmund Duhaney, was also arrested.

PepsiCo said in a statement that "competition can sometimes be fierce, but also must be fair and legal".

Coca-Cola said that it would review its security measures. The corporation's top-secret formula of its main drink was not affected in this security breach.

The 15-year-old who killed &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Currie"&gt;Christopher Currie&lt;/a&gt; was Ngatai Rewiti of &lt;a href="w%3AOtahuhu"&gt;Otahuhu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAuckland"&gt;Auckland&lt;/a&gt;. He has been found not guilty of &lt;a href="w%3Amurder"&gt;murder&lt;/a&gt; but guilty of &lt;a href="w%3Amanslaughter"&gt;manslaughter&lt;/a&gt; at the High Court of Auckland today, July 6. He was unable to be named earlier due to name suppression but after the verdict was heard Justice Helen Winkelmann lifted name suppression.

Rewiti will be given his sentence September 6.

The jury took four hours to reach the verdict after the four-day trial.

He was facing murder charges after dropping an eight-kilogram concrete block onto a car travelling on the Auckland motorway, killing the driver.

&lt;a href="w%3ALorraine%20Hunt%20Lieberson"&gt;Lorraine Hunt Lieberson&lt;/a&gt;, an American &lt;a href="w%3Amezzo%20soprano"&gt;mezzo soprano&lt;/a&gt; singer, died Monday morning at her home in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Lieberson, 52, died after a bout with terminal cancer, according to Richard Gaddes, general director of the Santa Fe Opera.

Lieberson was born in San Francisco where her father conducted community opera productions. She began her musical career as a violinist. 

Lieberson avoided the standard operatic repertoire, preferring instead to perform early (pre-1750) music and contemporary works. Particularly respected for her musicianship, she was focused on music and art, rather than on cultivating celebrity. 

Two weeks ago, Lieberson canceled all of her remaining 2006 performances. Lieberson's younger sister Alexis died of breast cancer in 2000, the same year the singer herself was diagnosed with breast cancer.

She is survived by her husband, mother, father, brother, and sister.

India and China finalised the agreement to open the pass in June 19, as part of an effort to improve diplomatic relations between the two. The opening comes only a few days after China inaugurated the &lt;a href="w%3AQinghai-Tibet%20Railway"&gt;Qinghai-Tibet Railway&lt;/a&gt;, which links &lt;a href="w%3ATibet"&gt;Tibet&lt;/a&gt; to the rest of China. 

The opening of the pass was marked by a ceremony on the Indian side attended by officials from both sides, including Sikkim Chief Minister &amp;ndash; the chief guest, the Chinese ambassador to India, and the Chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region, C Phuntsok. A delegation of 100 traders from India, and 100 Tibetans crossed the border to the respective trading towns. Despite heavy rain and chilly winds, the ceremony was marked with the attendance of many officials, locals, and international and local media.

At present, trade will be restricted to a small number of permitted goods, such as rice, tea and spices from India and goat and sheep skins, yak tails and silk from China. But the opening is expected to stimulate the economy of the region, and also bolster Indo-Chinese trade, which amounted to $7 billion in 2004. India hopes that the trade volumes between the two nations will grow to Rs. 206 crore (44.6 million US$) by 2007, and Rs. 12,203 crore (2.6 billion US$) by 2015.

<h1>New York's highest court upholds gay marriage ban</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=New%20York%27s%20highest%20court%20upholds%20gay%20marriage%20ban&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; State's Court of Appeals today rejected suits brought by gay and lesbian couples who sought equal treatment under the state marriage law. 

Three judges on the six-justice court signed the majority opinion, saying that &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Agay%20marriage"&gt;gay marriage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was a "question to be addressed by the Legislature." One justice concurred without signing the majority opinion and the remaining two dissented. 

The ruling pertains to four lawsuits brought by 44 same-sex couples who argued that the ban on homosexual marriage violates their rights under the state constitution.

In its 4&amp;ndash;2 ruling, the court wrote that it was reasonable for the state legislature to prohibit same-sex marriage on the grounds of stability in child rearing and rejected comparisons to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Amiscegenation"&gt;miscegenation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; laws.

"We do not predict what people will think generations from now, but we believe the present generation should have a chance to decide the issue through its elected representatives," said Judge Robert Smith on the ruling.

This decision will likely send the question of same-sex marriage back to the state legislature.

The only &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; state that allows same-sex marriage is &lt;a href="Massachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acivil%20union"&gt;civil union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; between same-sex couples is recognised by &lt;a href="Vermont"&gt;Vermont&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Connecticut"&gt;Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;. By either statutes or state amendments, 45 other U.S. states have made same-sex marriages unlawful.

A man urinated on National War Memorial in &lt;a href="w%3AOttawa"&gt;Ottawa&lt;/a&gt;. 

A retired Canadian military major, Michel Pilon, saw the man and two of his friends urinate on the memorial at about 11 p.m. Saturday. The man was photographed urinating on the National War Memorial in Ottawa. The 23-year-old was pictured smiling and making a hand gesture toward the camera. 

Ottawa police are looking for the 23-year-old &lt;a href="w%3AMontreal"&gt;Montreal&lt;/a&gt; man and his two friends, both under the age of 18. "They should have more respect," said, Ottawa police Sgt. Jean Lamothe. "This is a shrine to people who fought for us in the wars."

They could be charged with public urination or behaving in an offensive manner, and fined $125 or required to do a day of community work.

Canadian Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt; met with President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; at the White House today. The meeting was a short one and focused primarily on global security, particularly bilateral security issues addressing the two countries. 
One of the larger issues was the pending U.S. law that would require everyone crossing the Canada-U.S. border to have a passport or a special identification card. Prime Minister Harper said; "if the fight for security ends up meaning that the United States becomes more closed to its friends, then the terrorists have won," as part of his appeal that Congress delay or reject the proposed border law. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/06/AR2006070601119.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Prime Minister Harper brought birthday greetings and a surprise gift. But Bush found out about it during the press conference in the East Room. A Canadian reporter had allegedly blew the secret. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.guardian.co.uk/uslatest/story/0%2C%2C-5934795%2C00.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3APortugal"&gt;Portuguese&lt;/a&gt; Ministry of Culture suspended today the opening of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AAfonso%20I%20of%20Portugal"&gt;King Afonso Henriques&lt;/a&gt;' tomb. The opening of the tomb would allow investigators to reconstruct a biological profile of the first King of Portugal, who died 821 years ago.

This afternoon the Portuguese Institute of Architectural Patrimony (IPPAR) announced its decision to suspend the project for the reconstruction of the biological profile of Afonso I. For which the opening of the tomb at the &lt;a href="w%3ASanta%20Cruz%20Monastery"&gt;Santa Cruz Monastery&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href="w%3ACoimbra"&gt;Coimbra&lt;/a&gt;, was scheduled for today at 5 p.m. local time (1600 Thursday, UTC).

The note released by the Institute said that after consulting the "respective internal process it was evident that the adequate and necessary procedures were not fulfilled" which include the "authorization of this institute and of the minister of Culture for the accomplishment of the related exhumation".

When contacted by TSF news agency, the responsible of IPPAR Ilísio Summerville explained that they "had consulted the process and verified that neither the current direction of IPPAR, nor the previous one had given authorization for the act [of the opening of the tomb], because there was missing a series of authorizations, between them the authorization of the minister of Culture."

The responsible clarified that the investigation will be authorized as soon that "all formalities are fulfilled".

The original authorization to open the tomb consists of a letter sent by the regional director of IPPAR, José Maria Tadeu Henriques, on June 23, to Professor Eugénia Cunha, an specialist in Anthropology Biology of the Faculty of Sciences &amp; Technology of the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Coimbra"&gt;University of Coimbra&lt;/a&gt; and responsible for the investigation.

The team of investigators, lead by the anthropologist Eugénia Cunha, is composed of another two anthropologists of the University of Coimbra, Ana Carina Marques and Sónia Codinha, by the medic and anthropologist Miguel Botella (University of Granada), by the medic Bertrand Ludes and the geneticist Christine Kayser (University of Strasbourg), and by the historian José Mattoso (New University of Lisbon).

By analysing the bones and other remains, like hair and nails, of Portugal's founder, the investigators would be able to determinate his stature, genetic profile, diet and any diseases that he might have had.

A 36-year-old man, who is yet to be named, is undergoing surgery after an attacker lodged a knife through one cheek and out the other. The handle broke off, leaving the 15-cm (about 6 inches) blade inside him. The man was rushed to hospital today, July 7, at about 2 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3ATime_in_New_Zealand"&gt;NZST&lt;/a&gt;. The attack occurred last night after a domestic row in &lt;a href="w%3AAlbany%252C_New_Zealand"&gt;Albany&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="w%3AAuckland_%2528region%2529"&gt;Auckland&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ANorth_Shore%2C_New_Zealand"&gt;North Shore&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Police"&gt;New Zealand Police&lt;/a&gt; report that the knife just missed his &lt;a href="w%3Aoptic%20nerve"&gt;optic nerve&lt;/a&gt; and his condition is stable and not life threatening.

John Chaplin, head and neck surgeon said, "the man could be treated relatively simply. The major blood vessels of the head were further back in the neck and the knife could be relatively easily removed in an operating theatre where bleeding could be controlled."

The police have issued an arrest warrant for Vance Paraki Tuheke, 31-year-old, in relation to the attack.

The victim may suffer from some facial numbness.

&lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;Londoners&lt;/a&gt; are commemorating the one year anniversary of the &lt;a href="w%3A7%20July%202005%20London%20bombings"&gt;terrorist attacks&lt;/a&gt; on its transport networks that claimed 52 lives.

On this day last year, a series of coordinated suicide bombings struck London's public transport system during the morning rush hour, with three bombs exploded within 50 seconds of each other on three &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Underground"&gt;London Underground&lt;/a&gt; trains. A fourth bomb exploded on a bus nearly an hour later in &lt;a href="w%3ATavistock%20Square"&gt;Tavistock Square&lt;/a&gt;. Fifty-two people were killed in the attacks, as were the four bombers, and about 700 injured in the deadliest single act of terrorism in the United Kingdom since the Lockerbie bombing in 1988 and the deadliest bombing in London since the Second World War. The four suicide bombers were all UK residents, and while &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Qaeda"&gt;Al Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; has claimed responsibility for the attacks, police are unsure of its exact role in the attack.

Flowers were laid by mayor &lt;a href="w%3AKen%20Livingstone"&gt;Ken Livingstone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATessa%20Jowell"&gt;Tessa Jowell&lt;/a&gt;, Secretary of State for Culture, near &lt;a href="w%3AKings%20Cross%20station"&gt;Kings Cross station&lt;/a&gt; at 8:50 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Summer%20Time"&gt;BST&lt;/a&gt; (0750 &lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated%20Universal%20Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;), marking the time and place of the first attack on a &lt;a href="w%3APiccadilly%20Line"&gt;Piccadilly Line&lt;/a&gt; train beneath the station. 

Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt;, who attended a private memorial at London's Fire Brigade headquarters, said "This is a time when our country unites across all races, religions and divides and stands in solidarity with all those who have suffered so much, in sympathy with them and in defence of the values which we share,", and recalled the efforts of emergency and public service personnel and the public at large, in the aftermath of the attack. 

Tributes were also paid at Tavistock Square where a bus was attacked at 9:47 a.m. BST this day one year ago.

The bells of &lt;a href="w%3ASt%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral"&gt;St Paul's Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; tolled at the exact time of each of the bombings.

A two minutes silence was held across the UK at noon &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Summer%20Time"&gt;BST&lt;/a&gt; (1100 &lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated%20Universal%20Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;), including at the &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Championships%2C%20Wimbledon"&gt;Wimbledon&lt;/a&gt; tennis tournament. In many schools, offices, shops and town centres across the country the two minutes was observed. Other events are planned around London for later in the day.

Special programmes have been broadcast on British television to mark the occasion.

Yesterday, a video of one of the bombers, &lt;a href="w%3AShehzad%20Tanweer"&gt;Shehzad Tanweer&lt;/a&gt;, was broadcast on the Al-Jazeera television channel, claiming to link the attacks with Al-Qaeda.

<h1>Truckload of trouble for Thai Rak Thai</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Truckload%20of%20trouble%20for%20Thai%20Rak%20Thai&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
Yesterday saw &lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thailand's&lt;/a&gt; Attorney General file charges of election fraud with the country's Constitutional court. According to &lt;a href="w%3ASondhi%20Limthongkul"&gt;Sondhi Limthongkul's&lt;/a&gt; ThaiDay, the action seeking the dissolution of five parties was delivered by truck and consisted of over 120,000 pages of legal citations.

Both the &lt;a href="w%3AThai%20Rak%20Thai"&gt;Thai Rak Thai&lt;/a&gt; party making up the caretaker government and the main opposition &lt;a href="w%3ADemocrat%20Party%20%28Thailand%29"&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt; are named. The allegations centre on claims that Thai Rak Thai paid minor parties to participate where seats would otherwise be unopposed, and that the Democrats may have bribed parties to claim that they had been paid by Thai Rak Thai.

Thailand's prolonged political crisis originally stemmed from repeated corruption allegations against the Prime Minister, &lt;a href="w%3AThaksin%20Shinawatra"&gt;Thaksin Shinawatra&lt;/a&gt;. An April 2nd snap election apparently intended to cement the ruling party's position and dismiss critics as unrepresentative backfired when the three main opposition parties announced a boycott. This left many seats unopposed, particularly in the country's troubled Muslim south. With Thai Rak Thai standing alone in strong Democrat territory, a grassroots abstention campaign left many seats empty when they failed to garner the constitutionally required 20% of eligible votes.

Amongst all the political posturing, and allegations that the Election Commission had unduly favoured the ruling party, claims that there had been irregularities surfaced. Thai Rak Thai was accused of having paid minor parties to circumvent the 20% rule by offering token opposition. The claims were brought before the Election Commission who eventually handed the case over to the Attorney General without offering any recommendation. The commission's sub-committee that prepared the report had recommended the dissolution of Thai Rak Thai.

At present it is unclear if the political crisis will be resolved through the country's legal system prior to the upcoming October election rerun. The volume of evidence may leave the Constitutional Court unable to agree on a ruling prior to the election.

A &lt;a href="w%3Ahearse"&gt;hearse&lt;/a&gt; driver in &lt;a href="w%3ACounty%20Donegal"&gt;County Donegal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIreland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; was pulled over while leading a funeral procession, in a police crackdown on speeding. John Carr was clocked driving at 69 km/h (43 miles/hour) in a 50km/h zone and fined 80 euro and 2 penalty points were added to his driving record.

Carr, as well as other drivers in the cortege, were among hundreds of drivers caught speeding in the area. Irish police have said if the fines are not paid the drivers will face prosecution. Carr intends to pay the fine. He said, "I've never heard of a hearse being done for speeding before. I supposed I'll probably have to pay the fine. I'm not too worried about the points because I intend not to incur any more."

The &lt;a href="w%3AAll%20Blacks"&gt;All Blacks&lt;/a&gt; have defeated &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; 32 points to 12 in the opening match of the &lt;a href="w%3Arugby%20union"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Tri%20Nations%20Series"&gt;2006 Tri Nations&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3AJade%20Stadium"&gt;Jade Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AChristchurch"&gt;Christchurch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;. This victory cements them as favorites to take out the &lt;a href="w%3ATri%20Nations%20Series"&gt;Tri Nations&lt;/a&gt; this year- a competition which has adopted an expanded three round format this year. The All Blacks entered the match as firm favorites despite the Wallabies strong start to the season- winning three from three under new coach &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Connolly%20%28rugby%29"&gt;John Connolly&lt;/a&gt;. 

The All Blacks preformed a spirited rendition of their much talked of &lt;a href="w%3AHaka%20of%20the%20All%20Blacks"&gt;Kapa O Pango&lt;/a&gt; haka before the match, but it was Australia who opened up the scoring in the match, when &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Lathem"&gt;Chris Lathem&lt;/a&gt; regathered the ball off a chip kick and handed it to &lt;a href="w%3AMat%20Rogers"&gt;Mat Rogers&lt;/a&gt; who sprinted down the left sidelined and passed to &lt;a href="w%3ALote%20Tuqiri"&gt;Lote Tuqiri&lt;/a&gt; who scored the &lt;a href="w%3Atry"&gt;try&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AStirling%20Mortlock"&gt;Stirling Mortlock&lt;/a&gt; converted the try to take Australia out by seven points. Australia's &lt;a href="w%3ARocky%20Elsom"&gt;Rocky Elsom&lt;/a&gt; was sent to the sin bin in the 27th minute. Down one man Australia were not able to hold out the All Blacks after a messy line out. &lt;a href="w%3AKeven%20Mealamu"&gt;Keven Mealamu&lt;/a&gt; pounced on loose ball to score the All Blacks' first try. Daniel Carter, after missing two previous penalty goals, successfully converted the try. Five minutes from half-time, Mealamu barged over to score his second try of the match with Carter again converting. The All Blacks entered the half-time break leading the Wallabies 14 points to seven.

The All Blacks extended their lead over Australia seven minutes into the second half, with Carter kicking a successful penalty goal, to take the score to 17 points to seven. The television-match-official then awarded New Zealand another try after &lt;a href="w%3ARichie%20McCaw"&gt;Richie McCaw&lt;/a&gt; grounded the ball through the legs of &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Larkem"&gt;Stephen Larkem&lt;/a&gt;. Carter converted to take New Zealand's lead to 24 to seven with 30 minutes left on the clock. &lt;a href="w%3AScott%20Fava"&gt;Scott Fava&lt;/a&gt; came on for Australia in the 50th minute, and soon scored a try for Australia. Mortlock missed the conversion, and the score was at 24 to 12 in favour of the All Blacks. Carter added another penalty goal for the All Blacks in the 55th minute to take the score to 27 points to 12. A re-gathered charge down of an Australian kick saw Carter pass to &lt;a href="w%3AIsaia%20Toeavo"&gt;Isaia Toeavo&lt;/a&gt; who ran down the field to score a late try. Carter's conversion hit the upright and bounced out leaving the final score at 32 to 12 to the All Blacks. Australia face &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Africa%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3ASuncorp%20Stadium"&gt;Suncorp Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ABrisbane"&gt;Brisbane&lt;/a&gt; next week.

Facing criticism, potential 2008 presidential candidate and current &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;Federal Senator&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJoseph%20Biden"&gt;Joe Biden&lt;/a&gt; has been forced to explain his recent remark that "you cannot go to a &lt;a href="w%3A7-Eleven"&gt;7-Eleven&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="w%3ADunkin%27%20Donuts"&gt;Dunkin' Donuts&lt;/a&gt; unless you have a slight Indian accent."

On a recent edition of the &lt;a href="w%3AC-SPAN"&gt;C-SPAN&lt;/a&gt; series "Road to the White House," the &lt;a href="w%3ADelaware"&gt;Delaware&lt;/a&gt; senator is shown shaking hands with a man and boasting about his support among Indian-Americans.

"I've had a great relationship. In Delaware, the largest growth in population is Indian-Americans moving from &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;. You cannot go to a &lt;a href="w%3A7-Eleven"&gt;7-Eleven&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="w%3ADunkin%27%20Donuts"&gt;Dunkin' Donuts&lt;/a&gt; unless you have a slight Indian accent. I'm not joking," Biden said.

The clip made its way through cyberspace this week and caught fire in Washington, where Biden is known as one of the more long-winded senators.

Biden's office said the Senator admires, supports and respects the Indian-American community - and also sought to explain his gaffe.

"The point Senator Biden was making is that there has been a vibrant Indian-American community in Delaware for decades. It has primarily been made up of engineers, scientists and physicians, but more recently, middle-class families are moving into Delaware and purchasing family-run small businesses," said Margaret Aitken, a Biden spokeswoman.

"These families have greatly contributed to the vibrancy of the Indian-American community in Delaware and are making a significant contribution to the national economy as well," she said.

On July 7th, the Senator's remarks were debated on &lt;a href="w%3AHannity%20%26amp%3B%20Colmes"&gt;Hannity &amp; Colmes&lt;/a&gt;. Democratic political strategist Bob Beckel was quoted "Why didn't [Senator Biden] just apologize?"

The U.S. Army's surgeon general, Lt. Gen. Kevin C. Kiley, told reporters Friday that soldiers exhibiting personality disorders would not be automatically discharged because many can continue to perform their duties well. However, the army did discharge more than 1,000 soldiers last year for personality disorders. Among them was &lt;a href="w%3ASteven%20Dale%20Green"&gt;Steven Dale Green&lt;/a&gt;, who now stands accused of raping a young Iraqi female and murdering her and her family.

Kiley also said; "There is something very demanding and tough about being in combat. And anything that would be perceived as being weak and not ready and tough carries with it some stigma." 

U.S. Defense Department officials announced last month that they have set up a task force to study the mental health of American troops. The 14-member Mental Health Task Force’s primary job is to produce a required report for Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Congress before June 2007 that lays out a long-term plan to improve the effectiveness of the military’s mental health treatments, according to a Pentagon press release.

On May 4, prior to the creation of the task force, U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer said the military faces a "mental health crisis" and criticized the Pentagon for inaction. In a letter to Rumsfeld, Boxer noted that 25 soldiers committed suicide in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2005, up from 20 soldiers the year before.

Lawyers asked a federal court Friday to allow the government to inspect written materials that it seized from inmates at &lt;a href="Guantanamo%20Bay"&gt;Guantanamo Bay&lt;/a&gt; last month and requested approval to use "filter teams" to look at documents that may contain privileged lawyer-client communication.

In documents they filed with the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20District%20of%20Columbia"&gt;U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , government lawyers argued that three inmates who committed suicide last month by hanging themselves coordinated their actions by using attorney-client confidentiality to communicate with each other. Government officials said that among papers marked "Attorney Client Privilege" were instructions on how to tie knots and a classified memo on camp activities and inmate locations.

Military officials seized more than 1,100 pounds of documents from inmates after the suicides on June 10. They have since stopped defense lawyers from sending any documents to inmates.

In an affidavit that lawyers for the government filed with the court, Rear Admiral Harry B. Harris Jr., the naval commander of the camp, described evidence of a "larger plan or pact for more suicides" among detainees. His statement implied that the investigation might extend to defense attorneys as third parties who "encouraged, ordered or assisted" the detainees in killing themselves. 

Harris earlier described the suicides as part of a pattern of hostile actions on the part of terror suspects. "They have no regard for life, either ours or their own," he said last month. "I believe this was not an act of desperation, but an act of asymmetrical warfare waged against us." 

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACenter%20for%20Constitutional%20Rights"&gt;Center for Constitutional Rights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which has provided legal assistance to about 200 Guantanamo detainees, has been critical of the conditions at Guantanamo Bay that they say finally led the detainees to kill themselves in desperation.

Barbara Olshansky, a deputy legal director at CCR, described the government's latest legal activity as a tactic to impede detainees' access to legal representation "and to make these lawyers fight for yet another thing."

Last month after the document seizures, defense attorney Richard Wilson, who represents a Canadian detainee, said in an affidavit that the military had told him that they were conducting no investigation into the role of attorneys in the prisoners' deaths.

He added, however, that at least one detainee claimed that camp officials had confiscated his written materials and told him that they were looking into "whether lawyers had actively encouraged detainees to commit suicide."

The &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABeriev%20Be-200"&gt;Beriev 200&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aairplane"&gt;airplane&lt;/a&gt; leased to the &lt;a href="w%3AGovernment%20of%20Portugal"&gt;Portuguese Government&lt;/a&gt; suffered an accident last Thursday (July 6) afternoon, after one of its engines was damaged.

The accident occurred after a refueling operation at the dam of Aguieira, near &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASanta%20Comba%20D%C3%A3o"&gt;Santa Comba Dão&lt;/a&gt;. As the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AAerial%20firefighting"&gt;aerial firefighting&lt;/a&gt; aircraft took off at the end of the refueling maneuver in the water - designated as 'scooping' - its "left wing hit the top of the trees and the aircraft suffered some damage" to its fuselage, said Colonel Anacleto dos Santos, director of the Cabinet of Prevention and Investigation of Accidents with Aircraft (GPIAA), to the Portuguese newspaper Correio da Manhã.

While hitting the top of the trees, leaves and some wood entered the left engine, which didn't blow up, but that had to be turned off and the pilot was forced to release fuel for safety reasons. The release of the fuel started small &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AWildfire"&gt;wildfires&lt;/a&gt; across the area, reaching some houses, which were quickly extinguished by firefighters and helitack units of the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3APortuguese%20Republican%20National%20Guard"&gt;GNR&lt;/a&gt;'s Intervention, Protection and Rescue Group.

The airplane was able to do an emergency landing at the Monte Real Air Base, where it's currently operating from, thanks to the flight experience of one of the Russian pilots. When contacted by the Lusa news agency, National Service of Firefighters and Civil Protection, vice-president Lieutenant-Colonel Joaquim Leitão explained that the repairs will be made by the aircraft company and that all the parts necessary to repair the damages will have to come from Russia, by which the solution for the problem will take "some days".

Lieutenant-Colonel Leitão added that an investigation is in progress to analyse the circumstances under which the accident occurred. And when he was asked if the accident was caused by the limitations of the dam, given the dimensions of the aircraft, he said that the reconnaissance of the area had been performed before the scooping exercises began, and an operation officially kicks off when all the conditions are met.

The final report of the GPIAA will only be concluded in a few weeks but GPIAA director, Colonel Anacleto dos Santos, excluded two of the eventual causes of any aerial accident. "The atmospheric conditions were not adverse and there are no indications of mechanical failure. Everything points to human error."

On board of the aircraft followed two Russian pilots - one of them still receiving formation - and an Portuguese pilot that was observing the operations.

Two years ago, the Italian authorities tested the Beriev in the same mission type. Having the Portuguese Government sent observers to evaluate the performance of the aircraft. However, some limitations were found in the performing of the Russian aircraft in Italy's wildfire scenarios. Having the Italian Civil Protection reached the conclusion that the Beriev 200 is not prepared to operate in mountainous terrain.

&lt;a href="w%3APope%20Benedict%20XVI"&gt;Pope Benedict XVI&lt;/a&gt; visited the city of &lt;a href="w%3AValencia%20%28city%29"&gt;Valencia&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASpain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;. During his visit, he encouraged his followers in the country to defend traditional family values.

The government in Spain has introduced a number of reforms including gay marriage.

"It is a man and a woman who are made for each other and made to give humanity a future" said the Pope. "The family is a unique institution in God's plan, and the church cannot fail to proclaim and promote its fundamental importance," he said. 

He arrived for a 24-hour visit and was met at an airport by &lt;a href="w%3AKing%20Juan%20Carlos"&gt;King Juan Carlos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AQueen%20Sof%C3%ADa"&gt;Queen Sofía&lt;/a&gt;, and Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9%20Lu%C3%ADs%20Rodr%C3%ADguez%20Zapatero"&gt;José Luís Rodríguez Zapatero&lt;/a&gt;.

"The presence of your holiness brings great relief to everyone, especially to families who have lost loved ones," the king said in a welcoming speech.

The pope also met relatives of some of the underground crash victims. He prayed at the scene of a subway crash that killed 42 people on Monday. "We ask God's comfort for those who remain and those who left us," he said.
The pope will have a Mass tomorrow, which will close the visit. Zapatero said that he would not attend the mass on Sunday.

Google became a verb in the &lt;a href="w%3AMerriam-Webster"&gt;Merriam-Webster&lt;/a&gt; dictionary yesterday.

First founded in September 1998, &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; quickly became a phenomenon, overtaking the then top search engines &lt;a href="w%3AYahoo"&gt;Yahoo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALycos"&gt;Lycos&lt;/a&gt; etc.

Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary has added Google, along with Googling, to their dictionary. According to the dictionary, the correct pronunciation is goo-gle, with other forms including googled and googling.

The word 'google' is defined as a &lt;a href="w%3Atransitive%20verb"&gt;transitive verb&lt;/a&gt; meaning to use the Google search engine to look for information on the Internet.

This announcement comes on the heels of Merriam-Webster adding 'IM' as both a noun and a verb.

The &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20Province%20%28rugby%29"&gt;Western Province&lt;/a&gt; has defeated the &lt;a href="w%3ABlue%20Bulls"&gt;Blue Bulls&lt;/a&gt; in a regular season &lt;a href="w%3ACurrie%20Cup"&gt;Currie Cup&lt;/a&gt; fixture between the old rivals at the Bulls' home of &lt;a href="w%3ALoftus%20Versfeld"&gt;Loftus Versfeld&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3APretoria"&gt;Pretoria&lt;/a&gt;. Western Province won the match 15 points to 10, and became Western Province's first win over the Bulls in three years, and their first win at Loftus Versfeld since 2001.

The Bulls entered the match as favourites, however, it was the Western Province that scored the first &lt;a href="w%3Atry"&gt;try&lt;/a&gt; of the match, when &lt;a href="w%3AEgon%20Seconds"&gt;Egon Seconds&lt;/a&gt; made it over the line after 12 minutes of play in the first half. Western Province's second try came in the 37th minute of the match, minutes from the half-time break, with &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Pietersen"&gt;Joe Pietersen&lt;/a&gt; getting the try. Western Province entered half time with a 15 points to three lead over the Bulls. 10 minutes into the second half, two Blue Bulls found themselves with yellow cards; &lt;a href="w%3AFrikkie%20Welsh"&gt;Frikkie Welsh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AHeini%20Adams"&gt;Heini Adams&lt;/a&gt;. The Blue Bulls scored their first try in the second half, with &lt;a href="w%3AStefan%20Basson"&gt;Stefan Basson&lt;/a&gt; scoring two minutes from full-time. The final score was 15 points to 10, with Western Province scoring two tries, along with a conversion and penalty goal from &lt;a href="w%3ANaas%20Olivier"&gt;Naas Olivier&lt;/a&gt;, whilst the Blue Bulls scored one try, with a conversion and penalty goal from &lt;a href="w%3AMorn%C3%A9%20Steyn"&gt;Morné Steyn&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AManvendra%20Singh%20Gohil"&gt;Manvendra Singh Gohil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the 40-year-old son of the erstwhile Maharajah of Rajpipla (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ), was disowned by his formerly royal family for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="wikt%3Acome%20out%20of%20the%20closet"&gt;coming out&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as a gay man. 

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHomosexuality"&gt;Homosexuality&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was effectively criminalized in India in 1861 under British colonial rule. The sodomy laws, which remain in force today, mandate penalties of up to 10 years in prison.

The Gohil family once ruled India's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARajpipla"&gt;Rajpipla&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; principality. Although India abolished royalty when it gained independence from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUK"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 1947, the Gohil clan is considered to be one of the wealthiest families in the south Asian nation.

Gohil's mother put public notices in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGujarati"&gt;Gujarati&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; language newspapers disavowing being his mother. "If any individual or organisation dares to (name me as his mother), it will invite contempt proceedings," the statement said.

He said as an AIDS activist, he felt it was his duty to come out. Gohil claimed that India anti-gay laws hinder AIDS prevention among gay men since many are afraid to admit they are homosexual for fear of being jailed or blackmailed.

Gohil, who runs a non-profit &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAIDS"&gt;AIDS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; foundation, told reporters he wasn't interested in his family's money. "I will not stake my claim to the property. I have found a family in the (gay) community and am happy working for the community," he said in a Reuters interview.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUNAIDS"&gt;UNAIDS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; estimated that 5.7 million Indians have been infected by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHIV"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; virus. Gay organisations in India are currently trying to have the section of the Indian Penal Code that makes homosexuality a punishable offence nullified. Gay relationships are considered taboo in India's mostly conservative society. A number of Indian organisations, including two HIV/AIDS prevention groups, have complained of being subjected to police raids and arrests in recent years.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Jersey"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
At around 7&lt;a href="w%3APM"&gt;p.m.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AEastern_Daylight_Time"&gt;EDT&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJuly%208"&gt;July 8&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGovernor%20of%20New%20Jersey"&gt;Governor of New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJon%20Corzine"&gt;Jon Corzine&lt;/a&gt; signed a 30-billion &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;USD&lt;/a&gt; budget for the &lt;a href="w%3Afiscal%20year"&gt;fiscal year&lt;/a&gt; that began &lt;a href="w%3AJuly%201"&gt;July 1&lt;/a&gt;.

Due to strife between the Governor and the majority-holding &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Jersey%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;New Jersey Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Jersey%20General%20Assembly"&gt;New Jersey General Assembly&lt;/a&gt;, the budget was not passed before the previous one lapsed. Because of clauses in the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Jersey%20State%20Constitution"&gt;New Jersey State Constitution&lt;/a&gt;, the government cannot spend money without a full budget being approved beforehand. 

As a result of this, Corzine shut down large swaths of state government, kept essential officers working without pay, and declared a statewide &lt;a href="w%3AState%20of%20emergency"&gt;state of emergency&lt;/a&gt;.

The disagreement between the statehouse and &lt;a href="w%3ADrumthwacket"&gt;Drumthwacket&lt;/a&gt; was over how to deal with the 4.5 billion USD budget deficit: Corzine advocated raising the &lt;a href="w%3Asales%20tax"&gt;sales tax&lt;/a&gt; from 6% to 7%, the Assemblyers refused for a time. Under the final budget, the increase is implemented. Corzine states that all of the increased revenue will go towards covering the hole, while Assemblers want some of it to offset a planned decrease in the &lt;a href="w%3Aproperty%20tax"&gt;property tax&lt;/a&gt;

Following the promulgation of the budget, Corzine then signed another &lt;a href="w%3Aexecutive%20order"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; allowing the government to begin resuming normal operations. One of the first results of the budget's passing was the resumption of gambling in &lt;a href="w%3AAtlantic%20City"&gt;Atlantic City&lt;/a&gt;, which requires state monitors. The remainder of closed agencies and departments will come online again in the next two days; all government should be back to normal by &lt;a href="w%3AJuly%2010"&gt;July 10&lt;/a&gt;.

A Russian passenger plane has crashed after landing at &lt;a href="w%3AIrkutsk%20International%20Airport"&gt;Irkutsk Airport&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href="w%3ASiberia"&gt;Siberia&lt;/a&gt; and up to 150 people are feared dead in the crash. At 7:44 a.m. local time (2244 &lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated_Universal_Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt; Saturday), the plane veered off the rain-slipped runway as it was landing, tore through a concrete barrier, and crashed into the nearby garage buildings, causing the plane to burst into flames. Witnesses have said that the aircraft appeared out of control shortly before touchdown, and was travelling at a terrific speed.

There were 192 passengers and 8 crew onboard the aircraft. So far, 68 passengers have emerged injured and 124 bodies have been recovered. Russian officials suggest that the final death toll is likely to be closer to 150. None of the crew has survived. Many of the passengers were holidaymakers, and there were many children onboard. A few of the survivors are said to owe their lives to a flight attendant, who managed to open the emergency escape hatch in the rear of the aircraft. 

The Aircraft was an &lt;a href="w%3AAirbus%20A310"&gt;Airbus A310&lt;/a&gt;, travelling from Moscow airport.

A failure of brakes on a wet runway was cited as the possible cause of the crash (although unlikely).

An elderly man's body has been found floating in the water near &lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20suburbs%20in%20Wellington"&gt;Owhiro Bay&lt;/a&gt; quarry car park, by a man walking alone. The man who found the body immediately called the police. The body of the man, determined to be in his 60s, was found at 8:30 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3ATime_in_New_Zealand"&gt;NZST&lt;/a&gt;.

His body was found partially dressed and with both hands cut off at the wrists. The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Police"&gt;New Zealand Police&lt;/a&gt; report that there are signs that someone had tried to &lt;a href="w%3ADecapitation"&gt;decapitate&lt;/a&gt; him.

Harry Quinn, Detective Inspector said, "We need to know who this person is and from my point of view we do not know if the victim has been brought to the sea shore or if he has been placed out in the sea somewhere off the coast of Wellington."&lt;a href="http%3A//tvnz.co.nz/view/page/411425/779274"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3ADetectives"&gt;Detectives&lt;/a&gt;, Wellington Police Maritime and the Police National Dive Squad, totalling more than 40 officers, are working on the case. They are searching for items and the two missing hands.

The victim is European, in his 60s, grey hair, moderately built, between 175 and 180-&lt;a href="w%3Acentimetres"&gt;centimetres&lt;/a&gt; tall and, when found, was wearing dark trousers and black leather shoes.

The police have yet to determine the man's identity, or how long the body had been in the water.

Police have yet to report how the man died.

Police are seeking any information on this death. If you have any information, you can call the hot line: 0508 Redrocks (0508 733 762).

Communal tensions have risen in Mumbai as the &lt;a href="w%3AShiv%20Sena"&gt;Shiv Sena&lt;/a&gt; (which is widely perceived as a Hindutva party) protested against the vandalism of a staute of Meenatai at Shivaji Park. Meenatai was the wife of Shiv Sena founder &lt;a href="w%3ABal%20Thackeray"&gt;Bal Thackeray&lt;/a&gt; and a social worker. Shiv Sainiks blocked a main-road at Shivaji Park and forced many shops (especially in Sena dominated areas like Dadar and Navi Mumbai) to down their shutters. Reports say a &lt;a href="w%3Abandh"&gt;♡❤bandh♡❤&lt;/a&gt; has also been enforced in Andheri. A tourist bus has been torched by the protesters and Sena leader and former Union Minister &lt;a href="w%3AManohar%20Joshi"&gt;Manohar Joshi&lt;/a&gt; has threatened stringent action against those who hurled mud at Meenatai's statue. 

Joshi said that Meenatai, whom the Shiv Sainiks reverently refer to as Maasaheb, was "like a God" to the party and that the insult to her would be invite a strong reaction. He also authorities should arrest the perpetrators of the incident whilst taking adequate measures to avoid the deterioration of the law and order situation in the city. Executive President of the Shiv Sena, and Meenatai's son, &lt;a href="w%3AUddhav%20Thackeray"&gt;Uddhav Thackeray&lt;/a&gt; said, "It’s a question of sentiments, the Prophets cartoons sparked off a reaction in India, then if people react to this incident whom are you going to blame?" The activists also attacked a police station near the statue, accusing the police did not do enough to nab the culprits despite the station's proximity to the statue. 

The Sainiks also shouted slogans against Samajwadi Party leader Abu Asim Azmi, who they claim incited a mob in the nearby town of Bhiwandi to violence against the police. Two policemen and five members of the minority community lost their lives when law-enforcement's authorities clashed. Muslims were protesting the construction of a police station allegedly on land belonging to a cemetery. The situation was brought under control after the intervention of the Rapid Action Force. DGP Maharashtra, P.S Pasricha said that police in the state were on high alert to prevent communal violence. Police in Mumbai fired tear-gas shells to disperse the crowd in Shivaji Park and two additional battalions have been summoned to control the situation in Dadar.

Two small girls, who were reported as kidnapped on Saturday in the &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; western town of &lt;a href="w%3ABouill%C3%A9-M%C3%A9nard"&gt;Bouillé-Ménard&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AMaine-et-Loire"&gt;Maine-et-Loire&lt;/a&gt;), have been found safe in their village. 

A kidnap alert was issued by French Ministry of Justice to be broadcast on radio, television and by print media, the first alert to be issued since the system was instituted in February. 

The girls, Emeline and Melissa aged 10 and 8 years old respectively, were reported as missing at 3 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3ACentral_European_Summer_Time"&gt;CEST&lt;/a&gt; (1300 &lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated_Universal_Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;) on Saturday and were found with neighbours. Police officer Bertrand Delpierre told LCI television the exact circumstances of the disappearance were going to be examined in detail. 

"They seemed to be following, against their will, an individual of European type of an average height and size," read a statement from the Ministry of Justice. The statement also said that the suspect had tattoos on his arms, one of which appears to be that of a ram. About 200 officers had been working on the case.

The Agni III missile launch was not completely successful. The missile developed a snag and fell into the Bay of Bengal sea without hitting the target. Scientists said that they would analyse the scientific data and refire the missile at a later stage. The Indian Defence Minister, Pranab Mukherjee told the ♡❤Times of India♡❤ newspaper, "The take-off was successful but there were some problems later,"

In a speech regarding social justice tomorrow, Conservative leader &lt;a href="David%20Cameron"&gt;David Cameron&lt;/a&gt; is expected to call for better understanding of teenagers who wear "&lt;a href="w%3Ahoodies"&gt;hoodies&lt;/a&gt;". 

Mr Cameron will say that teenagers who wear hooded tops are trying to "blend in" rather than appear intimidating.

"The hoodie is a response to a problem, not a problem itself. We - the people in suits - often see hoodies as aggressive, the uniform of a rebel army of young gangsters," the 40 year-old is expected to state. 

"But hoodies are more defensive than offensive. They're a way to stay invisible in the street. In a dangerous environment, the best thing to do is keep your head down; blend in.

"For some people, the hoodie represents all that's wrong about youth culture in Britain today. For me, adult society's response to the hoodie shows how far we are from finding the long-term answers to put things right," Mr Cameron will also say.

His comments resemble those shared by the Archbishop of York earlier this year. 

"Ninety-nine per cent of those who wear hoodies are law-abiding citizens," &lt;a href="w%3ADr%20John%20Sentamu"&gt;Dr John Sentamu&lt;/a&gt; said while wearing a hooded top during a discussion on youth work in the Church. 

Hooded tops are viewed by some as characterising anarchy and social disorder. 

In 2005, the &lt;a href="w%3ABluewater%20Shopping%20Centre"&gt;Bluewater Shopping Centre&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AKent"&gt;Kent&lt;/a&gt; banned hoodies after claiming youngsters were using them to hide their faces from CCTV cameras while committing offences. 

Mr Cameron is also expected to use the controversial film &lt;a href="w%3AKidulthood"&gt;Kidulthood&lt;/a&gt; to illustrate the problems which young people face on a daily basis. The film, set in &lt;a href="w%3ANotting%20Hill"&gt;Notting Hill&lt;/a&gt;, was condemned for its harrowing representation of West London teenagers as criminals with no principles.

He will also praise charities that work with teenagers who live in inner cities, saying that the &lt;a href="w%3Avoluntary%20sector"&gt;voluntary sector&lt;/a&gt; can succeed where &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Labour"&gt;New Labour's&lt;/a&gt; state has failed. 

<h3>Change in direction</h3>

As well as attracting the attention of younger voters, Mr Cameron's speech highlights the compassionate direction in which he wants to steer the Conservative Party. 

But according to &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Brown"&gt;Michael Brown&lt;/a&gt;, a former Conservative MP and newspaper columnist, traditional Tory voters may not share Mr Cameron's empathetic beliefs.

"David Cameron is pushing at the envelope with regard to his backbench support and the support in the grassroots constituencies," he told &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20Breakfast"&gt;BBC Breakfast&lt;/a&gt;.

"I suspect this isn't going to go down well in the Bromleys and the Chislehursts"

"I suspect he's going to have to watch his back, and as he seeks new friends, as he seeks the new liberal constituency, he's got to make sure he doesn't lose his conservative constituency." 

Mr Cameron's immigration spokesman, Damian Green, said the Conservatives are addressing the problems of both youth crime and alienated young people - issues which &lt;a href="Tony%20Blair"&gt;Prime Minister Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; has failed to deliver on despite saying his party would be "tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime" in 1997.

Referring to that stance, Mr Green said: "That's indeed what we should aspire to as a policy; that's what he's failed to do in government. 

"We've seen that youth crime is growing, and that violent crime is growing, so while Tony Blair's soundbites were good, Tony Blair's actions in government have been less good."

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; military have charged four more soldiers with the rape and murder of a 14-year-old Iraqi girl, Abeer Qasim Hamza al-Janabi, and the murder of her parents and sister.

U.S. officials originally estimated the girl's age to be 25, but have since lowered their estimate. The girl's identity card and death certificate show her birth date as August 19, 1991. This was also confirmed by the mayor of Mahmoudiya, Mouyad Fadhil Saif, while speaking to CNN. U.S. Army spokesman Paul Boyce also said he has seen documents that indicate she could have been about 14. 

The soldiers allegedly conspired with Steven Green, who was charged on July 3 with rape and murder in connection with the same events. A sixth soldier was charged with dereliction of duty for not reporting the crime back in March when it happened.

A U.S. Justice Department affidavit states that the rape was pre-meditated and that three soldiers accompanied Green into the house while another soldier monitored the radio while the assault took place. The affidavit says that Steven Green shot the woman's family, including her 5-year old sister. He and another soldier then raped Abeer, and Green fatally shot her.

The affidavit quotes soldiers telling military investigators that Green and his companions then set the family's house on fire, burned their bloodstained clothing, and threw an AK-47 rifle used in the killings into a canal, in an effort to destroy evidence of the crime.

A U.S. military official has told the Associated Press that U.S. investigators will attempt to have Abeer's body exhumed in order to to collect forensic evidence.

The excitement began in the second half when the hosts who had captain Michael Ballack missing through injury got three goals in 20 minutes from the right boot of the 21-year-old Bayern Munich left midfielder. 

Schweinsteiger was dropped by coach Jurgen Klinsmann from his semi-final line up against Italy, a game Germany lost while Schweinsteiger was on the field late in extra time, won the third-place playoff game on his own with two individual efforts from 30 yards. 

Twice Schweinsteiger cut in from the left and fired right-footed at the net; twice he beat Ricardo. The first beat the Portuguese with pace over his head; the second swerved away to the keeper's left.

An own goal from a free kick 30 yards out from the left side of the penalty box netted what proved to be the game-winning goal. Driven low across goal it connected with Petit's knee and Ricardo could not stop it going in.

Portugal were strong in possession but lacked punch in attack; unable to convert 57 per cent possession into goals. Pauleta had two clear chances from 15 yards but both times hit tame shots that did not trouble Oliver Kahn. 

Kahn, FIFA player of the tournament at the 2002 World Cup, captained the side on his first appearance for Germany at the 2006 World Cup. After substitutions the host nation had used all outfield players in the squad in the competition.

Portugal were to get a consolation goal with help of substitute Luis Figo, who made his 127th and final cap for the Port shirts.

The veteran right winger almost immediately provided the precise distribution needed to unlock the German defence. A cross from the ring wing on 75 minutes found fellow substitute Nuno Gomes at the far post, who dived in for the consolation goal.

In the match the Portuguese left winger Christiano Ronaldo was booed and jeered each time he got the ball by a section of the 52'000 crowd. 

During the tournament the player had gained a reputation for being a showman but a bad sportsman guilty foul simulation (diving). The allegations made by players and media were denied by Ronaldo and his coach Luiz Felipe Scholari.

However it seemed to affect his performance. By the end of the match Ronaldo's famous multiple step-overs were gone although he remained dangerous with three out of four shots on target.

♡❤♡FIFA Young Player of the Tournament♡❤♡ 

German striker Lukas Podolski before the match was named by FIFA as Young Player of the Tournament. He scored three goals during Germany's run to the bronze.

♡❤♡Oliver Kahn retires♡❤♡

&lt;a href="w%3AOliver%20Kahn"&gt;Oliver Kahn&lt;/a&gt;, 37, captained the German team for the occasion and stated after the game that he would retire from international football. Kahn was popular with the German fans in the arena and cheered by the Stuttgart crowd for almost every touch.

<h1>Italy and France draw 1-1; Italy wins FIFA World Cup on penalties</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Italy%20and%20France%20draw%201-1%3B%20Italy%20wins%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20on%20penalties&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

French captain &lt;a href="w%3AZinedine%20Zidane"&gt;Zinedine Zidane&lt;/a&gt; did not help his team when, 20 minutes into extra time, he lost control of his emotions and got a red card after ramming his head into the chest of Italian player &lt;a href="w%3AMarco%20Materazzi"&gt;Marco Materazzi&lt;/a&gt;. 

The game was closely contested with the play makers on both sides - Andrea Pirlo and Zidane, on his last game before retirement - not getting much space with which to dominate the play. For Italy and France Gennaro Gattuso and Claude Makelele tackled hard. 

However; both creative midfield stars made important contributions to the only goals of the game. Zidane converted a chipped penalty after five minutes while Pirlo's magnificent corner, a quarter of an hour later, thundered into the net off Marco Materazzi's head.

Materazzi had previously conceded the penalty when he tapped Florent Malouda on his ankle as he ran past him in the penalty area.

In the first half Italy's left and right defensive backs Gianluca Zambrotta and Fabio Grosso penetrated down the French flanks. But after the break France came out the strongest. The flow of the game was disrupted when Patrick Viera pulled-up injured and Marcello Lippi made two substitutions on the hour. A deadlock resulted as teams tired and individuals battled for every ball without thinking too hard about constructing team attacks.

Materazzi was never far from the action in the final and though Italy had 55 percent of ball possession was one of the busier players on the pitch. France were slightly more potent offensively with 13 shots - out-shooting the Azzurri by eight attempts.

In Extra Time France came closest to a goal - Zidane, unmarked, headed to goal from 12 yards but was tipped over one-handed by Gianluigi Buffon. 

Zidane's next contribution to the game was not so graceful and appeared to be sparked by the close marking of the ubiquitous Materazzi. After a verbal altercation the 34-year-old turned around and drove his head violently into the Italian's upper chest. 

Materazzi was knocked backwards on the floor but the incident occurred off the ball and was not immediately noticed by the referee or his assistants. Buffon soon ran out of his penalty area to an assistant referee and the game was stopped. 

Horacio Elizondo ran to the touchline to consult with officials and returned waving a &lt;a href="http%3A//us.news1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/fifa/gen/fifa/20060709/i/1120612453.jpg"&gt;red card&lt;/a&gt; for the violent conduct of Zidane. It is likely FIFA used information from fourth and fifth official to confirm the decision. However &lt;a href="w%3AFIFA"&gt;FIFA&lt;/a&gt; denied video evidence claims alleged by France team's coach &lt;a href="w%3ARaymond%20Domenech"&gt;Raymond Domenech&lt;/a&gt;.

The headbutt and red card was Zidane's last action in football as he had said he would retire after the tournament.

A penalty shootout was necessary to decide the winner. Eight shots went in; David Trezeguet missed the one that mattered. His shot hit the crossbar and unlike Zidane's penalty in the first half, bounced down inches the wrong side of the goal line.

While Zidane was hanging his boots up Marco Materazzi scored Italy's third. Grosso, who in the second round had won a last minute penalty against Australia, powered in the fifth to give Italy the cup.

The only goal Marcello Lippi's Italy conceded during free play in the tournament proved to be an own goal from Cristian Zaccardo against the United States of America. 

Italy captain Fabio Cannavaro, on the occasion of his 100th cap, was instrumental in their defensive achievement. Amid wild scenes of joy on the pitch he jumped onto the podium and lifted the trophy, the fourth of Italy's history.

Opposition parties in Queensland have taken exception to the state cabinet's decision to dam Teviot Brook and the Mary River. Cabinet, the executive branch of the Australian state's government, made the decision on July 3 after months of discussion and planning.

The Labor government claimed the dams are necessary to maintain supply to Brisbane, the state's capital. Declining rainfall has left the city's 1.5 million people short of water, and the population is growing rapidly. The Nationals, the main opposition party, have criticised the cost of the new dam, and propose raising an existing one instead.

The &lt;a href="w%3AArgentina%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Argentina national rugby union team&lt;/a&gt; has qualified for the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Rugby%20World%20Cup"&gt;2007 Rugby World Cup&lt;/a&gt; to take place in &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; next year, during October and November. Argentina join Pool D with hosts &lt;a href="w%3AFrance%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href="w%3AIreland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; and two nations that will come through as Europe 3 and Africa.

The Pumas, as Argentina are known, defeated &lt;a href="w%3AUruguay%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Uruguay&lt;/a&gt; 26 points to nil at home at the San Isidro Athletic Club in &lt;a href="w%3ABuenos%20Aires"&gt;Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt; to take the first Americas spot. &lt;a href="w%3AMiguel%20Avramovic"&gt;Miguel Avramovic&lt;/a&gt; scored two &lt;a href="w%3Atry"&gt;tries&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href="w%3AFederico%20Todeschini"&gt;Federico Todeschini&lt;/a&gt; converting both, as well as kicking two penalty goals for Argentina. Following the Uruguay win, Argentina finished at the top of Round 3a of Americas qualifying. In their first match of Round 3a, Argentina defeated Chile 60 points to 12 in &lt;a href="w%3ASantiago"&gt;Santiago&lt;/a&gt;. Chile are currently in second place behind Argentina, however, there is still one fixture remaining, between Chile and Uruguay, so both nations have the chance to continue to the next round.

In the other group - Round 3b, the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt; are leading the table, though they and &lt;a href="w%3ACanada%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; have both won one game - having defeated Barbados, who are now out of the running for a place. The USA and Canada are meeting in &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20John%27s%2C%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador"&gt;St. John's&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, on August 12th, 2006, which will determine who goes through to the &lt;a href="w%3ARugby%20World%20Cup"&gt;World Cup&lt;/a&gt; as Americas 2, and who enters the Round 4 play-off against Chile to fight it out for Americas 3.

A &lt;a href="w%3APakistan%20International%20Airlines"&gt;Pakistan International Airlines&lt;/a&gt; (PIA) passenger plane crashed shortly after take-off in the eastern &lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistani&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href="w%3AMultan"&gt;Multan&lt;/a&gt;. The police chief present at the location told &lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt; that all 41 passengers and 4 crew members on board died in the crash. 

"Everyone is dead. I am standing at the site," Iftikhar Babar, the police chief, told Reuters. 

Airport officials said &lt;a href="w%3APIA%20Flight%20688"&gt;PIA Flight PK 688&lt;/a&gt; left Multan heading for Lahore and Islamabad. It crashed 10 minutes after take-off, 

"Bodies are badly charred. The debris has caught fire," an eyewitness told Reuters. He said rescue workers from the privately run relief foundation &lt;a href="w%3AEdhi"&gt;Edhi&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3APakistan%20Civil%20Aviation%20Authority"&gt;Civil Aviation Authority&lt;/a&gt;, and the army were taking part in the rescue operation.

Pakistan's private &lt;a href="w%3AGeo%20TV"&gt;Geo Television&lt;/a&gt; station also stated the aircraft to be in flames. They describe it as having gone down in a wheat field near a mango orchard, two miles from the airport. Several trees were burning from the impact of the crash and a perimeter wall was damaged. It also appeared to have hit an electric power line while crashing in the field. Police have cordoned off the area and are keeping people away from the scene.

It is still unclear if anyone on the ground has been killed or injured.

A PIA spokesman said: "The plane lost contact with the control tower about two minutes after take-off. We don't know what happened to it."

Mohammed Iqbal, an airline security official, confirmed that there were 41 passengers and four crew members on board the &lt;a href="w%3AFokker"&gt;Fokker&lt;/a&gt; aircraft.

The retiring &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="soccer"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; star &lt;a href="Zinedine%20Zidane"&gt;Zinedine Zidane&lt;/a&gt; has been awarded the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup"&gt;2006 Fifa World Cup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABallon%20d%27Or"&gt;Golden Ball award&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Zidane secured 2,012 votes, narrowly beating &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; captain &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFabio%20Cannavaro"&gt;Fabio Cannavaro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who secured 1,977. 

When Zidane headbutted Materazzi in the final match, it was expected that Zidane would not win the award because of the shameful incident. 

German striker &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMiroslav%20Klose"&gt;Miroslav Klose&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; won the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGolden%20Shoe%20award"&gt;Golden Shoe award&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for the most goals. Klose scored five goals in the tournament, besting the second highest goal scorer by two goals. Klose's strike partner &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALukas%20Podolski"&gt;Lukas Podolski&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , had won the best young player award of the tournament.

Italy's goalkeeper &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGianluigi%20Buffon"&gt;Gianluigi Buffon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; won the best goalkeeper award, while &lt;a href="Portugal"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt; were named the most entertaining team in the tournament.

&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Vancouver%20Sun"&gt;The Vancouver Sun&lt;/a&gt; obtained two reports relating to the search of a &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Columbia"&gt;British Columbia&lt;/a&gt; pig farm believed to be the location of 26 murders where the women's bodies were fed to the pigs which later went to market.

Police have said the investigation was "unprecedented in Canadian history" for its investigative and forensic aspects. The Canadian &lt;a href="RCMP"&gt;RCMP&lt;/a&gt; said that over 600 people waded through piles of animal waste, and uncovered the gruesome evidence.

The documents show that about 500 police and civilians, as well as 102 anthropology students were involved and received counselling throughout the search for forensic human remains.

"Water and soil analysis had to be done on a regular basis to check for contaminates that may cause health concerns for on-site personnel." the health services report said. "The investigators had to go through a lot of bird waste and animal waste, and infections from this was always a concern... Gloves and masks (were) worn by all working on the site."

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
A four-story building on &lt;a href="w%3A62nd%20Street"&gt;62nd Street&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AManhattan"&gt;Manhattan&lt;/a&gt; collapsed after an explosion Monday.

The New York Fire Department said that the owner of the building, Dr. Nicholas Bartha, might have deliberately caused the explosion in a suicide attempt after a difficult divorce. 

According to the latest reports, five people were injured by the blast, one of whom was hospitalised in critical condition. An additional ten firefighters were injured in the following rescue operation. No deaths have been reported.

Most sources give the cause as a &lt;a href="w%3Anatural%20gas"&gt;natural gas&lt;/a&gt; leak that ignited; a &lt;a href="w%3AConEd"&gt;ConEd&lt;/a&gt; spokesperson said that someone had reported a gas leak to them about one and a half hours before the explosion took place. The resulting fire, which began in the basement, burned strongly for some time, but was later brought under control by firefighters.

Numerous people described the shockwave from the blast as being similar to an &lt;a href="w%3Aearthquake"&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;'s most sophisticated &lt;a href="w%3AIntermediate%20Range%20Ballistic%20Missile"&gt;Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile&lt;/a&gt; (IRBM) to date, the &lt;a href="w%3AAgni-III"&gt;Agni III&lt;/a&gt; was test-fired off the &lt;a href="w%3AOrissa"&gt;Orissa&lt;/a&gt; coast earlier today. The missile took off from a fixed platform at the Integrated Test Range at &lt;a href="w%3AWheeler%20Island%2C%20India"&gt;Wheeler Island&lt;/a&gt; at 11:05 IST (05:35 GMT) in the presence of Defence Minister &lt;a href="w%3APranab%20Mukherjee"&gt;Pranab Mukherjee&lt;/a&gt; and his scientific advisor M. Natarajan. 

The missile took off vertically into space before re-entering the atmosphere and splashing down near &lt;a href="w%3ANicobar%20Island"&gt;Nicobar Island&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3ABay%20of%20Bengal"&gt;Bay of Bengal&lt;/a&gt;. Three sophisticated radars, six electro-optical tracking systems and three telemetric data stations on the mainland at Dhamra, Chandipur and the Andamans, together with a ship anchored near the splash-down point monitored the missile's trajectory. According to eyewitnesses, the missile blasted off into the sky leaving behind a trail of thick yellow smoke and disappeared out of sight into the clouds within seconds. 

The Agni-III, which has a range of 3,500 km and can carry up to 1000 kg of payload, has been described as the most powerful missile developed by India's &lt;a href="w%3ADefence%20Research%20and%20Development%20Organisation"&gt;Defence Research and Development Organisation&lt;/a&gt;. The missile, which is 16 metres long and has a diametre of 1.8 metres, has solid fuel boosters and is capable of carrying both conventional and nuclear warheads. The Agni-I and Agni-II, which were the earlier versions of the Agni series developed under the &lt;a href="w%3AIntegrated%20Guided%20Missile%20Development%20Programme"&gt;Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme&lt;/a&gt; (IGMDP), have already been inducted into the Indian Army. Boosters for the earlier two missiles had been provided by the &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Space%20Research%20Organisation"&gt;Indian Space Research Organisation&lt;/a&gt;, however, the Agni-III uses an entirely new booster vehicle.

25 &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20police"&gt;New Zealand police&lt;/a&gt; officers have left today, July 11, for three months in &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Timor"&gt;East Timor&lt;/a&gt;. The force will carry pepper spray and pistols.

The police force will assist the 160 &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Defence%20Force"&gt;New Zealand Defence Force&lt;/a&gt; armed personnel that are already in East Timor as well as other country's personnel.

Grant O'Fee, contingent commander, said "attempts will be made to establish good relations with village chiefs."

The police teams will try to prosecute those who are responsible for arson and assault following the recent violence in East Timor.

The recent two weeks of violence has died down since the former Prime Minister (PM) of East Timor resigned giving his post to the former foreign and defence minister, Jose Ramos Horta. This appointment has been congratulated by the United Nations (UN) Secretary General, Kofi Annan. Horta said the main priority for his government will be "restoring security and moving 150,000 people in refugee camps back home."

As &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; had previously announced, they will stop supporting three older versions of their flagship &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20Windows"&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt; operating system software, &lt;a href="w%3AWindows%2098"&gt;Windows 98&lt;/a&gt;, Windows 98 Second Edition and &lt;a href="w%3AWindows%20Millennium%20Edition"&gt;Windows Millennium Edition&lt;/a&gt; (Me).

On July 11, 2006 technical and public support and critical security updates for these products will end, as part of the Microsoft Lifecycle Policy. In their customer notification about the change, the software giant says they are ending support "because [these products] are outdated and these older operating systems can expose customers to security risks", and that customers are advised to upgrade to the company's newer &lt;a href="w%3AWindows%20XP"&gt;Windows XP&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Data%20Corporation"&gt;IDC&lt;/a&gt; analysts say that seventy million will be affected by the change. Because of the lack of security updates for Windows 98, it is possible that any still-existing security problems can be exploited.

Support questions on the Microsoft website relating to the software products can still be accessed and will remain for at least another year. Microsoft ended free support for these products in 2003. The end date of Extended Support for Windows 98 was originally January 16, 2004.

Seven bombs exploded Tuesday at various local railway stations in the city of &lt;a href="w%3AMumbai"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; between 6:24 pm and 6:35 pm &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Standard%20Time"&gt;IST&lt;/a&gt; (GMT+5:30).

The first blast ripped through the first-class compartment of a local train from &lt;a href="w%3AChurchgate"&gt;Churchgate&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3ABorivali"&gt;Borivali&lt;/a&gt;, near the &lt;a href="w%3AKhar%2C%20Mumbai"&gt;Khar&lt;/a&gt; station. Subsequent blasts occurred at &lt;a href="w%3ABhayandar"&gt;Bhayandar&lt;/a&gt; station near &lt;a href="w%3AMira%20Road"&gt;Mira Road&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMahim"&gt;Mahim&lt;/a&gt; station, &lt;a href="w%3AMatunga"&gt;Matunga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJogeshwari"&gt;Jogeshwari&lt;/a&gt; and Borivali. A seventh blast has occurred in the Khar-Santacruz subway. Local phone lines in Mumbai have been jammed. The &lt;a href="w%3APress%20Trust%20of%20India"&gt;Press Trust of India&lt;/a&gt;, quoting railway officials, said all seven explosions had targeted first-class cars. An eighth bomb was later defused at the Borivali station.

According to official report at least 183 people have died and over 714 were injured in the blasts, although the figures could rise given the fact that &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20Railway%20%28India%29"&gt;Western Railway&lt;/a&gt; trains are very crowded during the evening rush hour. Police are reportedly conducting raids throughout India in response to the bombings. Officials in Mumbai claim the explosions were a deliberate attack. India's Home Minister &lt;a href="w%3AShivraj%20Patil"&gt;Shivraj Patil&lt;/a&gt; said authorities had "some" information that an attack was coming "but place and time was not known". Heavy monsoon downpours have hampered the rescue efforts of the emergency services.

The Indian capital &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Delhi"&gt;New Delhi&lt;/a&gt; has reportedly been put on high alert after the blasts. Airports across the country are also on high alert as are sensitive installations in Mumbai. Mumbai's train system has been suspended and calls are made to keep the public away from the city's train stations. 

Prime Minister Dr. &lt;a href="w%3AManmohan%20Singh"&gt;Manmohan Singh&lt;/a&gt; called a emergency cabinet meeting and then released a statement saying that the bombings which have hit India lately are "shocking and cowardly attempts to spread a feeling of fear and terror among our citizens". The country's leading opposition party, &lt;a href="w%3ABharatiya%20Janata%20Party"&gt;BJP&lt;/a&gt;, claimed that the current policies of the government put the country in danger for terrorism.

There has been no claim of responsibility, but the attack has the trademarks of &lt;a href="w%3AKashmir"&gt;Kashmiri&lt;/a&gt; Islamic terrorist groups like the &lt;a href="w%3ALashkar-e-Toiba"&gt;Lashkar-e-Toiba&lt;/a&gt;. The group is known to have has set off bombs in quick succession in Indian cities before. India's domestic intelligence agency, the &lt;a href="w%3AIntelligence%20Bureau"&gt;Intelligence Bureau&lt;/a&gt;, claims that this attack, as also the grenade attacks in &lt;a href="w%3AJammu"&gt;Jammu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AKashmir"&gt;Kashmir&lt;/a&gt; earlier today were aimed at diverting attention from the elections being held in Pakistani Kashmir.

A terrorist and key supplier of explosives were arrested in Jangpura area of &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Delhi"&gt;Central Delhi&lt;/a&gt; on Monday after a tip-off. The police recovered 2 kg of &lt;a href="w%3ARDX"&gt;RDX&lt;/a&gt;, an explosive widely used by the military, in his possession. The police are interrogating him to find out if he had anything to do with the recent bombings.

&lt;br style="clear:both;"&gt;

Two days of vicious fighting in the &lt;a href="w%3ASomalia"&gt;Somali&lt;/a&gt; capital, &lt;a href="w%3AMogadishu"&gt;Mogadishu&lt;/a&gt;, has finally subsided with the surrender of troops loyal to the last remaining warlord in the city, &lt;a href="w%3AAbdi%20Qeybdid"&gt;Abdi Qeybdid&lt;/a&gt;. 

Around 500 soldiers loyal to Qeybdid handed themselves over to the &lt;a href="w%3AIslamic%20Courts%20of%20Somalia"&gt;Union Of Islamic Courts&lt;/a&gt; (UIC) on Tuesday, giving the UIC control of around 99% of the capital. It was not without cost however. Estimates suggest that at least 70 people have been killed since fighting broke out on Sunday, although &lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt; news agency puts the figure as high as 140. 

One doctor at Medina hospital in Mogadishu told &lt;a href="w%3AIRIN"&gt;IRIN&lt;/a&gt;: "We confirmed 43 yesterday [Monday] and 54 Sunday, a total of 97 deaths," although he admitted that more were being buried on the battlefield. 

Abdi Qeybdid is thought have been injured and still hiding inside the city. He is one of the last of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20of%20America"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; backed secular warlords who took control of the capital with the collapse of the government in 1991. The government itself is too weak to maintain the capital and so has been based in the southern town of &lt;a href="w%3ABaidoa"&gt;Baidoa&lt;/a&gt;. It is now divided over whether to continue negotiations with the Islamists, who it accuses of breaking an agreed ceasefire; talks between the two sides were supposed take place on Sunday in &lt;a href="w%3AKhartoum"&gt;Khartoum.&lt;/a&gt; 

The U.S. has accused the Courts of links with &lt;a href="w%3AAl-Quaeda"&gt;Al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;, which is strongly denied by one of the UIC leaders, Sheikh &lt;a href="w%3AHassan%20Dahir%20Aweys"&gt;Hassan Dahir Aweys&lt;/a&gt;. 

Relative calm has returned to Mogadishu, with people back on the streets and traffic returning to normal. In parts of the city already controlled by the Islamic Courts, road blocks have been lifted and the cost of food has dropped considerably. Many however are wary of the extremist elements within the Courts, which have so far seen the banning of the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup"&gt;World Cup&lt;/a&gt; coverage and public floggings. 

Now many in Mogadishu wish peace for a city that had taken damage as the site of many bloody fights over the past 16 years.

Massive concrete ceiling panels came crashing down in the I-90 Connector Tunnel of the &lt;a href="w%3ATed%20Williams%20Tunnel"&gt;Ted Williams Tunnel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ABoston"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt; killing a 38-year old woman.

The woman, Milena M. Delvalle, 38, of Jamica Plain was traveling with her husband, Angel Delvalle, 46 to Logan Airport just after 11:00 pm. At least four 3-ton ceiling panels fell on their car, partially crushing it. Milena Delvalle died on the spot while her husband managed to crawl out of the car window, sustaining only minor injuries. 

The panels are designed to be held in position by metal rods and an epoxy "glue", which appear to have failed, causing the collapse. The investigation into the collapse is focusing on the epoxy, reports CBS 4. 

The tunnel, which was opened in 2003, is part of the &lt;a href="w%3ABig%20Dig"&gt;Big Dig&lt;/a&gt; project. 

With the connector tunnel remaining closed, The collapse has caused substantial traffic delays.

After the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Supreme%20Court"&gt;Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; ruling from June 29, 2006, the &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; has announced that from now on all U.S. detainees are entitled to the protection Article 3 of the &lt;a href="w%3AGeneva%20Conventions"&gt;Geneva Conventions&lt;/a&gt;, including the detainees at the U.S. naval base at &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20Bay"&gt;Guantanamo Bay&lt;/a&gt;. The Supreme Court ruled that the system of &lt;a href="w%3Amilitary%20tribunal"&gt;military tribunals&lt;/a&gt; set up by the U.S. at Guantanamo was illegal. The announcement came just hours before Congress debates how to change the military tribunals to comply with the court ruling.

After &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%2C%202001"&gt;September 11, 2001&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush&lt;/a&gt; administration argued that those captured by the U.S. in the global 'war on terror' are "illegal enemy combatants" rather than prisoners of war.

United States &lt;a href="w%3Aattorney%20general"&gt;attorney general&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAlberto%20Gonzalez"&gt;Alberto Gonzalez&lt;/a&gt; argued in 2002 that fighting the war on terror requires new techniques and that the Geneva Conventions are "obsolete".

White House press secretary &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Snow"&gt;Tony Snow&lt;/a&gt; denied that the announcement constitutes a major shift in policy. 
"It is not really a reversal of policy. Humane treatment has always been the standard," he said.

Today, it was announced that &lt;a href="w%3ASyd%20Barrett"&gt;Syd Barrett&lt;/a&gt;, the founding member of British rock band &lt;a href="w%3APink%20Floyd"&gt;Pink Floyd&lt;/a&gt; died from a complication with &lt;a href="w%3ADiabetes"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. According to a Pink Floyd spokeswoman, he died days earlier (July 7) but the announcement was withheld. "He died peacefully at home. There will be a private family funeral in the next few days," said his brother Alan Barrett. "The band are naturally very upset and sad to learn of Syd Barrett’s death. Syd was the guiding light of the early band line-up and leaves a legacy which continues to inspire," noted a statement issued by Pink Floyd.

During 1967-1968, Syd Barrett was considered to be the main member and songwriter of Pink Floyd. However, due to mental illness, he was forced to leave the band after recording only one album, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Piper%20at%20the%20Gates%20of%20Dawn"&gt;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. Barrett had since been a recluse. Pink Floyd recorded ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWish%20You%20Were%20Here%20%28album%29"&gt;Wish You Were Here&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ as a tribute following Barrett's leave. The album features &lt;a href="w%3AShine%20On%20You%20Crazy%20Diamond"&gt;Shine On You Crazy Diamond&lt;/a&gt;, with lyrics explicitly about Barrett's rise to fame and subsequent dissolution.

A seven-year-old boy's feet were severed after he was sucked into a &lt;a href="w%3APump"&gt;water pump&lt;/a&gt; at a swimming pool. He is in intensive care as police investigate the water-park accident.

He was seriously injured yesterday when his feet became stuck in a pump that circulates water in one of the pools at Le Camping des Glissades d'eau St-Pie, in Sainte-Pie, &lt;a href="w%3AQuebec"&gt;Québec&lt;/a&gt;, 55 km (35 miles) east of &lt;a href="w%3AMontreal"&gt;Montréal&lt;/a&gt;.

Doctors amputated the boy's legs below the knee. The boy will be given &lt;a href="w%3AProsthesis"&gt;prosthetic&lt;/a&gt; feet.

"He should be able to walk by the end of the summer and to be back to school," said, doctors. "He will have to learn to walk again."

Park spokesman Denis Arcand said, "the pump did not have a protective grill over it at the time of the accident".

The park is now closed and will stay closed while police are investigating.

A group allegedly linked to al Qaida, Mujahedeen Shura Council in Iraq, posted a web video Tuesday which purported to show two U.S. soldiers' mutilated bodies and claimed the soldiers were killed to avenge the rape and murder of 14-year-old Abeer Qassim Hamza. 

The six American soldiers who have been charged with various crimes related to the alleged rape and murder incident are from the same unit as the two U.S. soldiers who were abducted, killed and mutilated, they claim.

The group said that the video was released as "revenge for our sister who was dishonored by a soldier of the same brigade" and that after their fighters heard of the rape and killing, "they kept their anger to themselves and didn't spread the news, but were determined to avenge their sister's honor. God Almighty enabled them to capture two soldiers of the same brigade as this dirty crusader," said a written statement posted on the Web along with the video. 

U.S. officials in Iraq condemned the release of the graphic video. "[Multi-National Division-Baghdad] condemns the release of the video in the strongest of terms; it demonstrates the barbaric and brutal nature of the terrorists and their complete disregard for human life. Coalition forces remain resolute in our commitment to catch perpetrators of this crime and bring them to justice."

The video is 4:39 minutes and shows two bodies in torn military uniforms; bloodied and mutilated. One is decapitated and fighters are shown turning the bodies over and also lifting the severed head.

A &lt;a href="w%3AG8"&gt;G8&lt;/a&gt; summit has been planned to take place from 15-17 July in &lt;a href="w%3ASaint%20Petersburg"&gt;St Petersburg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;. Several sources have reported that a systematic police crackdown on people participating in alternative meetings (a Libertarian Forum and the Russian Social Forum) and critical of the official meeting has begun almost a week prior to the summit. Estimates range from dozens to one or two hundred arrests and detentions.

For the past several years, especially since the &lt;a href="w%3A27th%20G8%20summit"&gt;27th G8 summit&lt;/a&gt; in 2001 in &lt;a href="w%3AGenoa"&gt;Genoa&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AG8"&gt;G8&lt;/a&gt; summits of the leaders of seven of the world's richest industrialised countries and of &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; have been regularly met by &lt;a href="w%3AG8%23Criticism"&gt;popular protests&lt;/a&gt; by critics who assert that members of G8 are responsible for global issues such as global warming due to carbon dioxide emission, poverty in Africa and developing countries due to debt crisis and unfair trade policy, exacerbating the AIDS crisis by medicine patent policy and other problems that are related to globalization. These protests have been met by massive numbers of arrests and police violence, on some occasions.

In contrast to previous G8 meetings, this time arrests have been taking place a week before the official meeting itself has started. At least 23-25 human rights activists and political activists, including two German citizens, have been detained by police in &lt;a href="w%3AMoscow"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt;, St Petersburg and other cities in Russia since 7 July. Many of them have been sentenced to ten days' imprisonment, enough to prevent them from participation in political protests until the end of the official summit.

Some sources claim that the true detention rate may be much higher, such as an unconfirmed report attributed to the &lt;a href="w%3ASKT"&gt;Siberian Confederation of Labour (Сибирской Конфедерации Труда)&lt;/a&gt; claiming 200 arrests. The activists' legal team claims that more than 100 arrests and detainments have occurred.

Discussions on global energy issues and other themes have started at the Libertarian Forum despite the arrests, and the Russian Social Forum is expected to start on schedule on 13 July, followed by the official G8 meeting on 15-17 July. Permission to carry out a street demonstration by the Russian Social Forum has been refused by the authorities.

Russian authorities say that demonstrations are permitted, but only in the location set aside for them - a sports stadium about 25 km (16 miles) from the &lt;a href="w%3AConstantine%20Palace"&gt;Constantine Palace&lt;/a&gt;, which will house the summit. The Russian Deputy Interior Minister Alexander Chekalin said that allegations of harassment were "from the realms of supposition". 

"The police's actions are commensurate with the situation at hand. The situation demands particular measures, sometimes intensified. Sometimes it demands that we visit a family in their apartment," He said.

&lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; launched its free online classified listing site, Windows Live Expo today in the United States market, announcing that it is no longer a public pre-release beta version, but "a fully fledged Windows Live service". The corporation is readying a UK version, too.

Expo, one of the 30+ announced &lt;a href="w%3AWindows%20Live"&gt;Windows Live&lt;/a&gt; services and software products, is the fifth service in the set to launch. It was previously available in a public beta form for U.S. residents.

On Windows Live Expo users can buy and sell items, post classified advertisements, and search for bargains. Similar Web sites include &lt;a href="w%3Acraigslist"&gt;Craigslist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aebay"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt;. Expo can perform searches for listings by people in a specific group (e.g. only e-mail contacts), and also by the geographic distance of the advertiser from the user.

The service is meant to be heavily integrated with other Windows Live products, such as Messenger and Spaces. The new version, compared to the betas, introduces the new Windows Live look, the ability to add comments to a listing, provides driving directions to a specific place (like the home of the seller of an item), and also provides more help for developers to expand upon Expo.

The announcement, published on the product team's blog, also noted that a UK version of the service was created and is available internally inside the company.

Expo was previously code-named Classified, and earlier code-named Fremont.

<h1>UK to get new nuclear power stations</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=UK%20to%20get%20new%20nuclear%20power%20stations&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20government"&gt;British government&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has given permission for new &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Anuclear%20power%20station"&gt;nuclear power stations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to be built in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. This decision follows months of public debate and controversy over the proposal. Many Britons have argued for greater use of &lt;a href="renewable%20energy"&gt;renewable energy&lt;/a&gt; supplies, but the government has said that even with a big increase in investment, renewable sources will not meet all of the UK's additional energy demands. It is expected that 25 GW of additional generating capacity will be required over the next two decades, partly as compensation for old nuclear stations which will be closed down. This additional capacity must be met while reducing overall greenhouse gas emission as per the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKyoto%20Protocol"&gt;Kyoto Protocol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The government also announced big increases in spending on renewable energy research and for the construction of onshore wind farms. It is claimed that 20% of energy will be produced from renewables by 2020, and if there are new breakthroughs in renewable energy science this figure may be increased further. Philip Wolfe of the Renewable Energy Association (REA) told the BBC "The government has seen the light on renewables. The energy review supports what we and many others have been consistently saying - that renewables, energy efficiency and decentralised systems are the strongest prospects for secure and sustainable energy supplies." 

The new nuclear plants will cost 400-500 million UK pounds (700-900 million US dollars) and will generate 1.5 to 2 GW of power each. These will provide the baseline amount of additional power should there be a lack of success in new areas of renewable energy research. The private sector will initiate, fund, construct and operate the new nuclear plants and will cover the full cost of decommissioning and their full share of long-term waste management costs. The Government proposes to address potential barriers to new nuclear stations, but says it will not provide any taxpayer money for the nuclear industry - tax investment will only be put into renewable energy research. This approach is similar to the successful approach adopted in the &lt;a href="USA"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt;. It contrasts with early UK nuclear power development, where individual power plants or small groups of plants were planned and built by separate publicly funded research and engineering groups, but there was poor planning of nationwide issues such as waste management. Critics argue that the government has only put the nuclear option on the table as it is privately run and does not require government investment, whereas increasing renewable energy production would cost taxpayer money.

The review also discusses energy self-sufficiency, and points out that the increase in renewable energy to 20% of the total will improve the UK's self sufficiency. No mention is made of opening uranium mines in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOrkney%20islands"&gt;Orkney islands&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (or reopening &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACornwall"&gt;Cornish&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; uranium mines) in order to make the UK self-sufficient in uranium, something which &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMargaret%20Thatcher"&gt;Margaret Thatcher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHistory%20of%20the%20Orkney%20Islands%23Twentieth%20Century"&gt;tried to address&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 1980.

Some critics were disappointed that the review had little discussion of the reduction of emissions from transport, a sector which gives a larger contribution to the total UK emissions than electricity generation. This may relate to the high costs associated with significant reductions in emissions in the transport sector.

Tonight, July 12, the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Police"&gt;New Zealand Police&lt;/a&gt; have arrested a man for murdering Tony Stanlake.

The alleged murderer, 21-year-old, will be in Wellington's District Court tomorrow morning.

Head Detective Inspector, Mike Arnerich, said "tonight's arrest was excellent news, police were still seeking more people in connection with the death. We firmly believe more people were involved in Tony's death. We've still got a lot of investigative work to do to identify and find these people." 

The 62-year-old's body was found mutilated in &lt;a href="w%3AWellington"&gt;Wellingtons&lt;/a&gt; south coast, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;. His hands were cut off at the wrists and the head had received numerous fractures.

The police had been seeking a &lt;a href="w%3ASubaru%20Legacy"&gt;Subaru Legacy&lt;/a&gt; which got stuck in the sand at &lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20suburbs%20in%20Wellington"&gt;Owhiro bay&lt;/a&gt; a day before the body was discovered, they found the car at &lt;a href="w%3AWainuiomata"&gt;Wainuiomata&lt;/a&gt;. They forensically examined the car, this was followed by the arrest of the man.

Police are still seeking more information about the Subaru and sightings of Mr Stanlake.

&lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; has launched an incursion into southern &lt;a href="w%3ALebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; in what they claim is a search for two Israeli soldiers. The soldiers were taken Wednesday following an attack by &lt;a href="w%3AHezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt;, a Lebanese militia, that had made an incursion into Israel. 

Three Israeli soldiers died and eleven were wounded when army transports patrolling at the Israeli-Lebanese border were attacked on Wednesday morning, near the Israeli village of Zar'it. Hezbollah also fired mortars and long-range rockets at the Israeli town of Shlomi and nearby communities. Six Israeli civilians were injured by the artillery fire.

After the attack two soldiers were found to be missing. Israeli troops and tanks then entered southern Lebanon, having claimed the soldiers were kidnapped&lt;a href="http%3A//www1.idf.il/DOVER/site/mainpage.asp%3Fsl%3DEN%26amp%3Bid%3D7%26amp%3Bdocid%3D54183.EN"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Following the incursion, five more soldiers were killed, four of them when an Israeli tank hit a mine. Hezbollah said one of its members died.

The Israeli air-force targeted several roads, bridges and Hezbollah outposts in an attempt to stop militants from moving the soldiers, Israel said. Two civilians were killed in an air raid on one of the bridges, while 23 others have been injured. Israeli artillery and gunboats also attacked other targets on Lebanese soil.

Later, Hezbollah said they had destroyed an Israeli tank which had crossed the border into Lebanon.

&lt;a href="w%3AEhud%20Olmert"&gt;Ehud Olmert&lt;/a&gt;, Israel's Prime Minister, blamed the attack on the Lebanese government calling it "an act of war" and vowed to deliver a "very painful and far-reaching" response. &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael%20Defense%20Forces"&gt;Israel Defense Forces&lt;/a&gt; Chief of Staff &lt;a href="w%3ADan%20Halutz"&gt;Dan Halutz&lt;/a&gt; told Israel's &lt;a href="w%3AChannel%2010%20%28Israel%29"&gt;Channel 10&lt;/a&gt; that if the soldiers are not returned "we will turn Lebanon's clock back 20 years".

Hezbollah Secretary-General, &lt;a href="w%3ASheik"&gt;Sheik&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AHassan%20Nasrallah"&gt;Hassan Nasrallah&lt;/a&gt;, hailed what he called the capture of the two soldiers calling them "our natural, only and logical right". He also said that the soldiers were taken to "a far away place" and that the only way to get them back was through an exchange with Lebanese and other &lt;a href="w%3AArab"&gt;Arab&lt;/a&gt; prisoners in Israeli jails.

The Israeli cabinet is in an emergency meeting and has yet to make an official statement about the situation. PM Ehud Olmert said previously that swapping of prisoners is not an option.

Hezbollah's announcement of their captures led to celebration scenes in a Hezbollah-strong suburb in Beirut with firing of guns in the air and handing out candy to children.

The Lebanese government issued a statement after an emergency meeting of the cabinet saying that it was not informed of the intentions of Hezbollah and that it does not endorse the group's actions. Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AFouad%20Siniora"&gt;Fouad Siniora&lt;/a&gt; was quoted as saying that "the government was not aware of and does not take responsibility for, nor endorses what happened on the international border". 

Hezbollah currently has two sitting members on the Lebanese government's ruling coalition.

The view recognized by the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; is one that condemned the attacks, but acknowledged that Lebanon had little say over Hezbollah in the south. The &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; said the militant group's violent actions were supported by &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASyria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;.

Israel has filed a complaint with the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; which called for the Security Council to enforce resolutions urging Lebanon to extend its authority throughout its territory and to disarm its militias.

&lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; was fined €280.5 million today by the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Commission"&gt;European Commission&lt;/a&gt; for not complying to a 2004 antitrust ruling by the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;. 

EU had ruled in 2004, asking Microsoft to provide its competitors information about its Windows operating system. This was to give the rivals a level playing ground for writing software for the Windows platform to compete with Microsoft's own offerings. 

The EU set a dead-line of July 21 for Microsoft to provide complete technical information to its competitors. If not, there may be further fines, up to €3 million a day.

The commission is saying that Microsoft has not done enough on the issue and must provide the information by July 31. Microsoft however does not agree to this and believes that it has done no wrong, and has in fact complied to the 2004 EU ruling. 

The European Union's Commissioner for Competition Neelie Kroes has warned Microsoft to comply with these regulations for their upcoming Operating system, Vista which is scheduled to be released in 2007.

A controversial &lt;a href="w%3Adefamation"&gt;defamation&lt;/a&gt; court case is continuing today in &lt;a href="Edinburgh"&gt;Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt; after hearing fresh allegations against one of &lt;a href="Scotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;'s most influential politicians. &lt;a href="Tommy%20Sheridan"&gt;Tommy Sheridan&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3AMember%20of%20the%20Scottish%20Parliament"&gt;Member of the Scottish Parliament&lt;/a&gt; (MSP) and convener of the &lt;a href="w%3AScottish%20Socialist%20Party"&gt;Scottish Socialist Party&lt;/a&gt;, is pressing ahead with the case despite claims of orgies and other sexual acts by tabloid newspaper ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANews%20of%20the%20World"&gt;The News of the World&lt;/a&gt;.♡❤

Since the case began over a week ago, the courtroom has heard allegations from several &lt;a href="journalism"&gt;journalists&lt;/a&gt;, MSPs and colleagues of Mr Sheridan, with witnesses telling of scandals varying from extra-marital group sex to "threats that someone would pull out a tongue". The case began after ♡❤The News of the World♡❤ printed several pieces in 2004 and 2005, making allegations regarding Mr Sheridan's personal life. The newspaper stands by the articles as true, despite the MSP claiming £200,000 in damages.

Many of the original articles centre around the former market researcher Helen Allison, who claims that, in 2002, she was invited to a &lt;a href="Glasgow"&gt;Glasgow&lt;/a&gt; hotel by a friend to attend a "&lt;a href="w%3AVIP"&gt;VIP&lt;/a&gt; party." Upon arrival, she was taken up to a suite where she saw Tommy Sheridan "having sex with a female at the bottom of a bed and another man sitting at the side of the bed putting a condom on." It was alleged by ♡❤The News of the World♡❤ that this woman was a &lt;a href="w%3Aprostitute"&gt;prostitute&lt;/a&gt;. It was after selling this story to the newspaper that Miss Allison received threats that her tongue would be removed.

The courtroom has also heard testimonials from another witness, 38 year-old journalist Anver Khan. Miss Khan told the court that she had visited a "&lt;a href="w%3ASwingers%27%20Club"&gt;Swingers' Club&lt;/a&gt;" in &lt;a href="Manchester"&gt;Manchester&lt;/a&gt; with Mr Sheridan. She has also told of threats and attacks by individuals associated with the MSP, who is currently married to Gail Sheridan. In a show of unity, the couple have been arriving at court each day hand in hand.

The trial is set to last for two weeks in total.

<h1>Investigation into Mumbai train bombings begins</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Investigation%20into%20Mumbai%20train%20bombings%20begins&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The toll in yesterday's serial bombings on &lt;a href="w%3AMumbai"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/a&gt;'s commuter trains has risen to 200 killed, with 714 people injured, according to the official estimate released by the Police. 127 victims have been identified and a further 56 remain unidentified, the estimate said. No group has so far claimed responsibility for the attacks. Indian authorities have said that the Kashmiri militant group &lt;a href="w%3ALashkar-e-Toiba"&gt;Lashkar-e-Toiba&lt;/a&gt; (LeT) may be involved. An LeT spokesman has denied any involvement. 

The day after the blast, schools, colleges and offices functioned normally in Mumbai and the commuter train service targeted in the bombings was operational. Many commuters rode the trains to work, though their numbers were smaller than usual. The Bombay Stock Exchange, located in the city shrugged off the bombings, with the BSE SENSEX gaining 3 percent on opening, calming fears that economic confidence will be undermined by the blasts. 

<h2>Investigation underway</h2>
The &lt;a href="w%3AMaharashtra"&gt;Maharashtra&lt;/a&gt; state government has announced a reward of Rs. 25,000,000 (about US $55,000) for information leading to the arrest of the perpetrators. A number of people, reported to be 350&lt;a href="http%3A//timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/msid-1743218%2Ccurpg-2.cms"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have been detained for interrogation, but no arrests have been made. Police are working on preparing sketches of possible suspects, news reports say.

The ♡❤Times of India♡❤ newspaper reported that Indian intelligence officials believe that Lashkar-e-Toiba and the banned &lt;a href="w%3AStudents%20Islamic%20Movement%20of%20India"&gt;Students Islamic Movement of India&lt;/a&gt; were behind the blasts. The Home Ministry confirmed the involvement of Students Islamic Movement of India&lt;a href="http%3A//www.expressindia.com/fullstory.php%3Fnewsid%3D70969"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The Chief Secretary to the Maharashtra state government, D K Shankaran told Reuters news agency "So far it looks like there was a substantial involvement of Lashkar-e-Toiba with local support,"&lt;a href="http%3A//today.reuters.com/News/newsArticle.aspx%3Ftype%3DworldNews%26amp%3BstoryID%3D2006-07-13T112446Z_01_SP208890_RTRUKOC_0_US-INDIA-BLAST.xml"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

P.S. Pasricha, director-general of police in Maharashtra, speaking to reporters, said that while it was too early to say who is responsible for the attacks, the coordinated explosions were in the style of &lt;a href="w%3ALashkar-e-Toiba"&gt;Lashkar-e-Toiba&lt;/a&gt; (LeT), which has been blamed for carrying out similar attacks before. Indian authorities have accused Kashmiri militant groups such as the Lashkar, &lt;a href="w%3AJaish-e-Mohammed"&gt;Jaish-e-Mohammed&lt;/a&gt; (JeM) and the &lt;a href="w%3AHizb-ul-Mujahideen"&gt;Hizb-ul-Mujahideen&lt;/a&gt; of attacks on civilians before. The &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20mafia"&gt;Mumbai underworld&lt;/a&gt; is another potential suspect - a series of bombings in Mumbai in 1993 which killed 250 people are believed to have been planned by a Mafia don &lt;a href="w%3ADawood%20Ibrahim"&gt;Dawood Ibrahim&lt;/a&gt;. India alleges that Ibrahim lives in Pakistan and has long maintained that Lashkar-e-Toiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed have been trained and supported by Pakistan in the past.

Spokesmen for the Lashkar-e-Toiba and Hizb-ul-Mujahideen have denied any role in the attacks. The LeT spokesman said that LeT could "feel the pain of the victims" of the attacks as the people of Kashmir have been suffering "the same pain for the last 17 years at the hands of the Indian security forces", adding that an "independent investigation should be carried out... so that the people behind the attack can be exposed". 

"Attacks on civilians are not part of our manifesto. We never carried out such attacks nor will allow anyone to do so," said Ehsan Elahi, spokesman for the Hizb-ul-Mujahideen.

<h2>International condemnation</h2>
The attacks have been condemned by a number of countries around the world. India's neighbours &lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AAfghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a href="w%3AUK"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AEU"&gt;EU&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="w%3ASpain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, which witnessed a &lt;a href="w%3A11%20March%202004%20Madrid%20train%20bombings"&gt;similar attack&lt;/a&gt; in 2004; &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AUN%20Secretary%20General"&gt;UN Secretary General&lt;/a&gt; amongst others have spoken out against the attacks. 

A statement released by Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the attacks, saying "Terrorism is a bane of our times and it must be condemned, rejected and countered effectively and comprehensively." 

<h3>India faults Pakistan Foreign Secretary statement</h3>
The Pakistani Foreign Minister Khurshid Mehmood Kasuri, after condemning the attack, noted that not much progress has been made on &lt;a href="w%3AHistory%20of%20the%20Kashmir%20conflict"&gt;Kashmir problem&lt;/a&gt;, he said, "incremental approach is good but now we must tackle real issues. And this is the best way of tackling extremism in South Asia". 

India took exception to this remark. External Affairs Ministry spokesman Navtej Sarna described the statement as ‘appalling’, saying Mr Kasuri’s “remarks appear to suggest that Pakistan will cooperate with India against the scourge of cross-border terrorism and terrorist violence only if such so-called disputes are resolved,”. 

He urged Pakistan to "dismantle the infrastructure of terrorism" 
on territory under its control and act in the spirit of the joint statement reached between the two countries on January 6, 2004.

Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran told a news channel on Wednesday that India may review some of the confidence building measures it is jointly developing with Pakistan, following the attacks. A meeting between Mr. Saran and his Pakistani counterpart, scheduled to take place on July 20-21, is also under question, with the External Affairs Ministry spokesman Navtej Sarna failing to make any announcement regarding the date.

Pakistan's foreign ministry rejected these accusations in a statement, saying Mr Kasuri's remarks had been misreported and denying he had drawn a link between the bombings and the Kashmir dispute. and said that Pakistan was "in the forefront of international efforts to fight [the] menace" of terrorism.

<h2>Prime Minister addresses nation</h2>
In an address to the nation, the Indian Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AManmohan%20Singh"&gt;Manmohan Singh&lt;/a&gt; expressed his condolences to the victims of the attacks and to their families, saying that India stands by the people of Mumbai and &lt;a href="w%3ASrinagar"&gt;Srinagar&lt;/a&gt; (where 8 people were killed in a grenade attack yesterday) "in this hour of grief". "My heart goes out to those who have lost their loved ones", he said. 

He acknowledged the "courage and humanism" shown in the response to the attacks and the efforts of the emergency and service personnel and the public in the aftermath of the tragedy. 

Saying that Mumbai is the symbol of a united, inclusive India, he said that India will "continue to walk tall, and with confidence despite the attack".

The Union Home minister &lt;a href="w%3AShivraj%20Patil"&gt;Shivraj Patil&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20National%20Congress"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt; party chief &lt;a href="w%3ASonia%20Gandhi"&gt;Sonia Gandhi&lt;/a&gt; and Railway Minister &lt;a href="w%3ALaloo%20Prasad%20Yadav"&gt;Laloo Prasad Yadav&lt;/a&gt; visited Matunga Road railway station late yesterday. Mr Patil appealed for unity and restraint in responding to the attack. Mr Yadav has announced an ex-gratia compensation of Rs 5,00,000 (US $11,000) to the families of the dead and promised jobs in the railways for the families who have lost earning members in the bombings.

<h2>Opposition BJP calls for tougher anti-terrorism measures</h2>
The Leader of the Opposition &lt;a href="w%3AL%20K%20Advani"&gt;L K Advani&lt;/a&gt; and President of the Opposition &lt;a href="w%3ABharatiya%20Janata%20Party"&gt;Bharatiya Janata Party&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ARajnath%20Singh"&gt;Rajnath Singh&lt;/a&gt;, who visited the blast sites and the met with the injured, called the bombings "an attack on India". 

A resolution adopted by the BJP office-bearers criticised the central &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Progressive%20Alliance"&gt;UPA&lt;/a&gt; government, charging that it was sending "consistent signals that the initiative against terrorism can be traded for votes". However, Mr. Advani said that "it 
was not the time for criticising the government". He said that the blasts showed up the need for a stringent anti-terrorism law and that the authorities must not give an impression that they are willing to compromise national security. 

In 2004, The UPA government had repealed such a law, the &lt;a href="w%3APrevention%20of%20Terrorist%20Activities%20Act"&gt;Prevention of Terrorist Activities Act&lt;/a&gt; enacted by the previous BJP-led government.

&lt;br style="clear:both;"&gt;

Police have arrested &lt;a href="w%3ALord%20Levy"&gt;Lord Levy&lt;/a&gt;, chief fundraiser to the &lt;a href="w%3ALabour%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Labour Party&lt;/a&gt; and close associate of &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt;. Lord Levy was arrested by the Specialist Crime Directorate of London’s Metropolitan police as part of an on-going investigation into the &lt;a href="w%3Acash%20for%20peerages"&gt;cash-for-peerages&lt;/a&gt; row which has troubled the Labour government since the start of the year. He was bailed on Wednesday afternoon without charge pending further enquiries.

In a statement, Lord Levy said the arrest was “totally unnecessary”. A spokesman also said: "He has not been charged and does not expect to be, as he has committed no offence." 
The cash-for-peerages affair erupted earlier this year, after an independent body reported that Tony Blair had sold &lt;a href="w%3Apeerage"&gt;peerages&lt;/a&gt; (the title of Lord) to businessmen in exchange for secret donations to the Labour Party. This potentially breaks the &lt;a href="w%3AHonours%20%28Prevention%20of%20Abuses%29%20Act%201925"&gt;Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act&lt;/a&gt; of 1925 which was originally introduced after Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ALloyd%20George"&gt;Lloyd George&lt;/a&gt; was caught selling peerages for personal funds. 

The ruling Labour Party admitted soon after that it had borrowed over £14 million before the last general election in 2005. The opposition Conservative Party also admitted it had been loaned £16 million by wealthy businessmen. It’s believed that as chief fundraiser, Lord Levy arranged the Labour Party’s loans. 

All political parties deny any wrong-doing, although the arrest of one of the Prime Minister’s closest allies is going to provide yet more scandal for the already troubled party. 

Downing Street has so far declined to comment on what they call a “party matter” and Levy himself has accused the police of “over-reacting”. Some politicians have commented that the situation could be very serious for Mr. Blair.

&lt;a href="w%3AZinedine%20Zidane"&gt;Zinedine Zidane&lt;/a&gt; has apologised on French TV for his actions on the World Cup final, Wednesday - but the apology did not extend to his victim. Zidane had headbutted Italian player &lt;a href="w%3AMarco%20Materazzi"&gt;Marco Materazzi&lt;/a&gt; and was sent off after 110 minutes play.

But on French television Zidane showed remorse for his behaviour. "I want to ask for forgiveness from all the children who watched," he said.

It was expected that Zidane would reveal what provoked him into the headbutt. However, Zidane refused to divulge what Materazzi actually said but did say that Materazzi made remarks which were "very personal" and specifically concerned his mother and sister. 

Materazzi had earlier admitted that he insulted Zidane, but denied any remarks on Zidane's mother or having made a racial slur. 

"I didn't insult his mother. I lost my mother when I was 15 years old and still get emotional when I talk about it." 

"Zidane is my hero and I have always admired him a lot," said Materazzi.

While the French star's comments contradicted Materazzi's view Zidane also refused to apologise to Materazzi for his on-field assault. "I want to apologise to them [the children] but I can't regret what I did because it would mean that he [Materazzi] was right to say what he said".

The partial apology comes as FIFA President Sept Blatter said Zidane may be stripped of his Golden Ball award for the tournament's best player. FIFA set up a disciplinary committee to investigate Zidane's violent conduct.

After the red card to Zidane, Italy went on to win the final on penalty kicks.

Canadian media company &lt;a href="w%3ACHUM%20Limited"&gt;CHUM Limited&lt;/a&gt; has announced that it has agreed to be acquired by larger rival &lt;a href="w%3ABell%20Globemedia"&gt;Bell Globemedia&lt;/a&gt; Inc. for $1.7 billion &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20dollar"&gt;CAD&lt;/a&gt; cash, bringing the &lt;a href="w%3ACTV"&gt;CTV&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACitytv"&gt;Citytv&lt;/a&gt; broadcast-television networks and such &lt;a href="w%3Aspecialty%20channel"&gt;specialty channel&lt;/a&gt;s as &lt;a href="w%3AMuchMusic"&gt;MuchMusic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATSN"&gt;TSN&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABravo%21"&gt;Bravo!&lt;/a&gt; under the same corporate umbrella.

Shareholders will receive $52.50 per common share of CHUM and $47.25 per Class B (non-voting) share. The estate of the late &lt;a href="w%3AAllan%20Waters"&gt;Allan Waters&lt;/a&gt;, who died late last year, has agreed to tender all its shares to the bid, netting the Waters family nearly $450 million.

In a joint statement, CHUM's chairman, Jim Waters, said, "In Bell Globemedia's offer, we not only found value for shareholders, but confidence that we would be placing CHUM in the hands of an owner with the financial resources and track record to continue to grow and build on our collective legacy."

Globemedia &lt;a href="w%3AChief%20Executive%20Officer"&gt;CEO&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AIvan%20Fecan"&gt;Ivan Fecan&lt;/a&gt; added, "We are able to make this premium offer because Bell Globemedia is clearly the most logical buyer of CHUM. There is a unique strategic fit to our operations that can make the united company a stronger national champion in broadcasting. We intend to maintain and build the valuable CHUM brands and develop more opportunities for Canadian programming." He added that CTV and Citytv will remain separate networks and "will maintain separate and independent news divisions in order to ensure a continued diversity and competition in news coverage."

In a separate release, CHUM announced it would be cutting 281 jobs at its stations across the country, particularly at its Citytv stations in western Canada. Effectively immediately, evening newscasts at &lt;a href="w%3ACKVU-TV"&gt;CKVU-TV&lt;/a&gt; Vancouver, &lt;a href="w%3ACKEM-TV"&gt;CKEM-TV&lt;/a&gt; Edmonton, &lt;a href="w%3ACKAL-TV"&gt;CKAL-TV&lt;/a&gt; Calgary and &lt;a href="w%3ACHMI-TV"&gt;CHMI-TV&lt;/a&gt; in the Winnipeg market are being eliminated, with plans for a new newsmagazine tentatively titled ♡❤In Your City♡❤ at the three Prairie stations, and more resources being put into each station's local version of &lt;a href="w%3ABreakfast%20Television"&gt;Breakfast Television&lt;/a&gt;. Less drastic changes are planned for its &lt;a href="w%3AA-Channel"&gt;A-Channel&lt;/a&gt; stations in smaller markets. The company said these changes will result "in a significant reduction in staffing and operating costs."

The companies said that they expect to sell CHUM's A-Channel stations, as well as Alberta educational broadcaster &lt;a href="w%3AAccess%20Alberta"&gt;Access&lt;/a&gt;, to third parties, despite CTV's historical ties to several of them. Many of the A-Channel stations were originally acquired by CHUM from Baton Broadcasting, the predecessor of Bell Globemedia, in 1997, as part of a trade that sent CHUM's &lt;a href="w%3ACTV%20Atlantic"&gt;ATV&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAtlantic%20Satellite%20Network"&gt;ASN&lt;/a&gt; assets in &lt;a href="w%3AAtlantic%20Canada"&gt;Atlantic Canada&lt;/a&gt; to Baton and allowed Baton to acquire the CTV network itself.

Despite CHUM's ownership of MuchMusic and CTV's recent launch of &lt;a href="w%3AMTV%20Canada"&gt;MTV Canada&lt;/a&gt;, the companies claim their specialty channels are "complementary" and did not indicate any sale plans.

Bell Globemedia is currently majority-owned by &lt;a href="w%3ABCE%20Inc."&gt;BCE Inc.&lt;/a&gt; but is awaiting regulatory approval for a restructuring involving the &lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20Teachers%20Pension%20Plan"&gt;Ontario Teachers Pension Plan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATorstar"&gt;Torstar Corp.&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="w%3AKen%20Thomson"&gt;Thomson&lt;/a&gt; family. In the interim, the takeover offer will be made by a new company owned by the proposed new shareholder structure.

&lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; have today put forward a jointly-crafted resolution regarding sanctions against &lt;a href="North%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;. The document was released to counter a &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt; alternative, which was written in response to last week's &lt;a href="w%3ATaepodong-2"&gt;Taepodong-2&lt;/a&gt; missile tests. This Sino-Russian version, however, removes sections which could advocate military action against &lt;a href="w%3APyongyang"&gt;Pyongyang&lt;/a&gt;. 

The move comes after a number of Chinese requests this week to revise the original Japanese version, claiming that tensions in the region would increase if it were to be adopted. As a result, Chinese diplomats have been instructed to veto the initial document, which advocates much stronger sanctions against North Korea than neighbours Russia and China would have felt comfortable with. 

The two nations presented their revised resolution to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; this afternoon. After reviewing a draft copy - which was released to the Associated Press - several influential nations, including the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, have reaffirmed their support for Japan's initial version.

Both Russia and China, who share a border with the nation, have been placed in a difficult position by last week's missile tests. Both countries have relatively positive relations with North Korea but their commitment to the international community - mainly the &lt;a href="w%3AUN%20Security%20Council"&gt;UN Security Council&lt;/a&gt; - has led to an impartial stance on this issue. The publishing of this "counter-resolution" is the first active move the two nations have made against the North since the tests, who still approve of sanctions but describe Japan's proposed extensive restrictions as "over-reacting."

Japan and the United States have announced tonight that they still intend to put their first resolution to a vote, despite the threat of a veto by China and possibly Russia. A Japanese diplomat has said that the Sino-Russian reworking was "a step in the right direction" but lacked decisive wording on important issues. The use of weaker language - namely asking instead of demanding - has also been criticised.

&lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt; has not commented directly on the new resolution, but has instead urged North Korea to return to the &lt;a href="w%3ASix-Party%20Talks"&gt;Six-Party Talks&lt;/a&gt;, which are seen to be a key step forward in ensuring diplomacy between the nation and its democratic peers.

<h1>Psilocybin induces mystical and spiritual experiences: study</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Psilocybin%20induces%20mystical%20and%20spiritual%20experiences%3A%20study&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A study published by researchers at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Hopkins%20University"&gt;John Hopkins University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;a href="Baltimore%2C%20Maryland"&gt;Balitmore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Maryland"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt;) concluded that &lt;a href="psilocybin"&gt;psilocybin&lt;/a&gt;, a hallucinogenic drug, causes experiences of "substantial personal meaning and spiritual significance" in users. A majority of the participants felt a better sense of well-being, even months after consuming the drug. Researchers expect that the results can be used for further investigation of psychoactive substances and cognition.

The experiment, led by Roland R Griffiths, assessed the degree of mystical experience and attitudinal effects of the psilocybin experience; this report was published in the journal ♡❤Psychopharmacology♡❤.

Thirty volunteers without prior experience with hallucinogens were given psilocybin and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Amethylphenidate"&gt;methylphenidate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Ritalin) in separate sessions. The Ritalin sessions served as the control group who used that drug as a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aplacebo"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The tests were &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Adouble-blind"&gt;double-blind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , with neither the subject nor the administrator knowing which drug was being administered.

The degree of mystical experience was measured using a questionnaire on mystical experience developed by Ralph W Hood; 61% of subjects reported a "complete mystical experience" after their psilocybin session, while only 13% reported such an outcome after their experience with Ritalin. Two months after taking psilocybin, 79% of the participants reported moderately to greatly increased life satisfaction and sense of well-being.

About 36% of participants also had a strong to extreme “experience of fear” or &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Adysphoria"&gt;dysphoria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (eg, a "&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Abad%20trip"&gt;bad trip&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ") at some point during the psilocybin session (which was not reported by any subject during the methylphenidate session), with about one-third of these (13% of the total) reporting that this dysphoria dominated the entire session. These negative effects were reported to be easily managed by the researchers and did not have a lasting negative effect on the subject’s sense of well-being.

<h1>Day of attacks continue in Israel and Lebanon</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Day%20of%20attacks%20continue%20in%20Israel%20and%20Lebanon&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The clashes follow a &lt;a href="Hezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt; raid into Israel which they called "Truthful Promise" in which Hezbollah claimed to have captured two Israeli soldiers. Israel said the men were kidnapped.

Israeli aircraft launched missiles at Beirut international airport and damaged runways and fuel stores. Additional targets were attacked, including 18 bridges, and a Hezbollah run TV station, &lt;a href="w%3AAl-Manar"&gt;Al-Manar&lt;/a&gt;, which continued to broadcast after being targeted, but later went partially off air. 

45 Lebanese civilians and two soldiers were reported killed as a result of Israeli overnight raids and 103 people were injured. In some areas Israeli planes had dropped leaflets to warn residents to stay away from Hezbollah buildings.

Over 100 rockets were fired from Lebanon towards northern Israel Thursday, which the Israeli Army says are the acts of Hezbollah. Two Israeli civilians were reported killed over 100 injured.

The Lebanese road communications network was targeted: 18 bridges were damaged and early on Friday the highway linking Beirut and Damascus was hit by five Israeli missiles. The highway is the only route out of the country after the airport was shut down. Witnesses said that the road was free from traffic when the missiles hit.

In a television interview, Wednesday July 12, Brigadier Gen. Dan Halutz had told Israel's Channel 10 that if the Israeli soldiers were not returned Israel would "turn Lebanon's clock back 20 years". He also said of Lebanon "nothing is safe."

<h2>Lebanon</h2>
<h3>Beirut International Airport</h3>
Israeli airforce attacked Beirut &lt;a href="w%3ARafic%20Hariri%20International%20Airport"&gt;Rafic Hariri International Airport&lt;/a&gt; in the Lebanese capital twice on Thursday.

</ul>
<h2>International reaction</h2>
 Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert had called the first Hezbollah attack on Israel "an act of war." Israel also blamed Iran and Syria for the attacks&lt;a href="http%3A//www.forward.com/articles/8095"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

In related news, the United States vetoed a UN condemnation of Israel on Thursday. The draft vetoed was proposed by &lt;a href="w%3AQatar"&gt;Qatar&lt;/a&gt; and demanded that Israel pulled back its forces from the Gaza Strip. 

<h2>Economic impact</h2>
The turmoil in the Middle East has led to record high prices for oil, which is now trading at $76.70 a barrel.

The stock market in &lt;a href="w%3ATel%20Aviv"&gt;Tel Aviv&lt;/a&gt; closed down 4.3 percent on Thursday. The &lt;a href="w%3AShekel"&gt;Shekel&lt;/a&gt; has also slipped against the dollar. 

Other international events are also having it say on stock markets worldwide as investors are keeping their eyes on North Korea and Iran's nuclear ambitions in addition to the situation in the Middle East.

Thomas McIntyre at McIntyre, Freedman &amp; Flynn put it this way: "We're having a complete breakdown in attitude toward the stock market. In a declining market, everything that's wrong in the world seems more important."

Nine months after announcing the interoperability between their &lt;a href="w%3Ainstant%20messaging%20%26amp%3B%20messengers"&gt;instant messaging&lt;/a&gt; (IM) services, Internet rivals &lt;a href="Microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Yahoo"&gt;Yahoo!&lt;/a&gt; began limited public &lt;a href="w%3ASoftware%20release%20life%20cycle"&gt;beta&lt;/a&gt; (pre-release) testing of the program. This enables users of the two services to communicate with each other using their existing IM client, Microsoft's &lt;a href="w%3AWindows%20Live%20Messenger"&gt;Windows Live Messenger&lt;/a&gt; (formerly MSN Messenger) and &lt;a href="w%3AYahoo%21%20Messenger"&gt;Yahoo! Messenger with Voice&lt;/a&gt;.

Users wishing to use the new feature can go to a special page on the service's website, where they have to review and accept an agreement. After signing out and signing in again, the interoperability is enabled without downloading any new software.

The service is designed to allow users to see each others' online presence, view personal status messages, share select emoticons, view offline messages and add new contacts from either service. However, more advanced features, like voice calls and shared folders are not interoperable between the two services.

The program is available internationally in more than 15 markets.

Israel's naval ships have entered Lebanon's territorial waters to enforce a blockade on the Levantine state, Thursday. 

"Since this morning Israeli naval vessels have enforced a full naval closure on Lebanon, because Lebanon's ports are used to transfer both terrorists and weapons to the terror organizations operating in Lebanon," a spokesman for &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael%20Defense%20Forces"&gt;Israeli Army&lt;/a&gt; said. 

The spokesman did not comment on whether Israel had also blockaded Lebanon's airspace. However Israeli aircraft attacked Beirut's Rafik al-Hariri International Airport, Thursday morning, which damaged the main runway and forced incoming flights to divert to Cyprus. Israel's Army Radio said that other airports might also be targeted in order to restrict access to Lebanon. 

"We will take all necessary measures to bring an end to the rogue behavior of a state that does not assume responsibility and put an end to the activities of a major partner in their own government," said Israeli Cabinet Minister Isaac Herzog to Reuters. 

The government in Beirut has said it accepts no responsibility for what &lt;a href="Hezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt; claimed was the capture of two Israeli soldiers, in an attack which injured six Israeli civilians. 27 civilians have been killed so far in Israeli raids on Lebanon.

<h1>Elmwood Village Hotel proposal in Buffalo, N.Y. withdrawn</h1>

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
According to the developer Savarino Construction Services Corporation, the proposed Elmwood Village Hotel which would be placed on the corner of Elmwood and Forest Avenues in &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt; has been withdrawn from the city's Planning Board and Common Council and will undergo a "do over"; however, Eva Hassett, Vice President of Savarino says that the proposal will be resubmitted, from scratch by the end of next week.

The hotel would require the demolition of at least five properties, 1109-1121 Elmwood and would cause the closure of several businesses. Already, two businesses, Skunk Tail Glass and Six Nations Native American Gift Shop have relocated, outside the Elmwood Strip. Don apparel, H.O.D. Tattoo and Mondo Video still remain on Elmwood; however, Mondo Video is planning on moving to a new location. The hotel will be 72 rooms and will cost at least 7 million dollars to build.

"We're lovers, not fighters. Our energies should be spent on developing a really wonderful project, not wasted in court. We'll start over with a clean slate and take as much time as necessary to hear people out and end up with a very positive project for the neighborhood," said President of Savarino Construction, Sam Savarino.

The hotel will not undergo any major changes in its design says Savarino. "We would anticipate little if any physical change to the plans." He also alleges that the issues with the hotel were not with the design or the proposal and also says that the hotel is still right for the intersection. 

"The perceived problem was with the process, not the proposal itself. We believe this is the right thing to do on that corner," added Savarino.

According to the ♡❤Buffalo News♡❤, the projects resubmission is aimed to "shed the lawsuits" against the proposal. The ♡❤Buffalo News♡❤ also claims that the Common Council members are all still "in favor of the project." The proposal was unanimously passed by the council on March 21, 2006.

Attorney Arthur J. Giacalone who represents the plaintiffs, Nancy Pollina and Patricia Morris, who operate Don Apparel (a vintage clothing and collectibles shop at 1119 Elmwood Avenue), Angeline Genovese and Evelyn Bencinich, owners of residences on Granger Place which abut the rear of the proposed site, Nina Freudenheim, a resident of nearby Penhurst Park, and Sandra Girage, the owner of a two-family residence on Forest Avenue less than a hundred feet from the proposed hotel's sole entrance and exit driveway, says that the hotel proposal was "inappropriately rushed," but some council members disagree. Defendants in the lawsuit against the hotel are, Buffalo's Common Council and Planning Board, Mayor of Buffalo, Byron W. Brown, Savarino Construction Services Corporation, Hans J. Mobius and his son Hans S. Mobius owners of the properties at stake, Pano Georgiadis, owner of Pano's Restaurant on Elmwood, and Cendant Corporation, the parent company of Wyndham Hotels, which will be, according to Savarino, the hotel operator. Attorney David State is representing the city, Planning Board, Mayor Byron Brown and the Common Council.

"I don't think it was a rush job," said Dominic J. Bonifacio Jr., the council's Majority Leader.
He also alleges that the only way to make "it [the hotel] a better project and ease the concerns of some neighbors would be to find a way to provide more parking."

In an exclusive phone interview with Wikinews, Giacalone states that the lawsuit against the hotel and the city "will not be moved [withdrawn] unless the Common Council resins their [prior] decisions in passing the proposal." Giacalone also says that Savarino has yet to submit any new plans for the proposal to the city. He also says that he "still plans to represent all plaintiffs" if they wish to continue with the suit and the use of his services.

Giacalone rescheduled the preliminary hearing which is "still in place" for July 27, 2006. When asked if the properties are still owned by Mobius, Giacalone replied "yes" and that according to attorney Bob Knoer, the Lawyer representing Hans Mobius, the owner of the properties that could be demolished, there is "no contract between Savarino" and that Mobius "plans to put the properties back on the market." Mobius has not returned phone calls or e-mails and has not yet commented on the situation or the proposal itself. The city denies these claims. 
In an exclusive phone interview by Wikinews, area councilman Joseph Golombek states that the reason for the resubmission of the proposal was due to "a mistake in the Planning process" and that none of the council members have "indicated that they have changed their opinions on the hotel" and still remain in favor of the project.

"I still think the Hotel is a good idea for that part of Elmwood. For Elmwood to stay strong and vibrant it must continue to grow and adapt to change. It is a different community than it was twenty years ago and will be different in another twenty years. The opponents of the Hotel 
have the opportunity to challenge it and are doing that. Even though I disagree with them I am glad there is a safety mechanism for people who disagree with government. We need to keep moving forward," added Golombek.

Supporters of the hotel proposal are planning on holding a rally to support the new development. ♡❤WNYmedia.net♡❤ claims that the first rally will be held to support the hotel proposal on July 17, 2006 at 5:00 p.m. on Elmwood and Forest, on the site of the proposed location. According to ♡❤WNYmedia.net♡❤ they "are tired of the anti development crowd in Western New York." They also blast opponents of the hotel proposal calling them "bananas" and "nimbys." People opposed to the hotel proposal are planning on "counter attacking" with their own protest on the same day and time.

&lt;a href="FIFA"&gt;FIFA&lt;/a&gt; has begun disciplinary proceedings against &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMarco%20Materazzi"&gt;Marco Materazzi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; after &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AZinedine%20Zidane"&gt;Zinedine Zidane&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was sent off for headbutting Materazzi in the chest. Zidane has said he reacted to provocation.

Both players have been summoned to attend a hearing of its disciplinary committee on Thursday 20 July and a decision is expected later that day.

FIFA said: "The decision was taken following claims made by Zinedine Zidane, who attacked Materazzi with a headbutt during the final."

Zidane has the right to make a written statement, which must be submitted by Tuesday 18 July.

Materazzi will then be given a copy of the statement so he can respond.

A Canadian Forces &lt;a href="w%3AAgustaWestland%20EH101"&gt;CH-149&lt;/a&gt; of 413 Squadron based at CFB Greenwood, Nova Scotia crashed while conducting a night training exercise. Killed in the incident were Sgt. Duane Brazil, 39; Master Cpl. Kirk Noel, 33; and Cpl. Trevor McDavid, 31. 

The aircraft was conducting a hoist operation at 12:30 AM local time near a Canadian Coast Guard Vessel. The helicopter ditched near the ship and suffered damage to the forward fuselage but remained floating. All seven crew were recovered from the wreckage. In addition to the three killed, four others were taken to hospital. One of the injured was transported by air ambulance to Halifax for further treatment. 

The CH-149 is a Canadian designation for the AgustaWestland EH101 built in Italy. Canada purchased 15 for Search and Rescue duties. This is the first fatal crash in Canadian service. The aircraft were previously grounded due to cracks in critical rotor components which were believed to be the cause of the crash of a British Merlin (EH101) in 2004. 

The aircraft involved was number 149914 indicating it was the 14th of the 15 aircraft delivered (serials 149901 to 149915).

As many as eight people have been injured after two cable cars collided at the Nevis Range near Fort William in Scotland.

Two &lt;a href="w%3ARAF"&gt;RAF&lt;/a&gt; helicopters, an air ambulance, four ambulance crews, police, fire brigade and a mountain rescue team are among those present. Police have confirmed that three people have been injured, including one child. Injuries include broken legs, head and chest injuries. The Scottish Ambulance Service have reported that up to seven people had been thrown on to the hillside. A reporter at the scene said one car near the top of the mountain had slid down a cable, hitting another and then one of the cars fell to the ground.

Northern Constabulary have stated "It's understood that two gondolas would appeared to have collided and a number of casualties have been reported. The local mountain rescue team, Inverness helimed and other air support are in attendance to remove casualties".

The &lt;a href="w%3ADoppelmayr"&gt;Doppelmayr&lt;/a&gt; gondola system is made up of eighty six-seat closed cabins running on a continuous 4.6km steel cable.

Fighting continues today across the Israeli-Lebanese border as Israel continue to pound targets in Lebanon using aircraft and ship launched weapons. In what is claimed as a retaliation to Wednesday's attack by Hezbollah on an Israeli border patrol and the subsequent capture of two Israeli soldiers, Israeli aircraft have launched missiles at the Beirut international airport, which Israel claims is being used to transport weapons and ammunition to Hezbollah, and destroyed the runway.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnites%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; agreed to sign a bill that would allow for a limited judicial review of the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Security%20Agency"&gt;National Security Agency&lt;/a&gt;'s controversial &lt;a href="w%3ANSA%20warrantless%20surveillance%20controversy"&gt;eavesdropping program&lt;/a&gt;, said the &lt;a href="w%3ASenate%20Judiciary%20Committee"&gt;Senate Judiciary Committee&lt;/a&gt; Chairman &lt;a href="w%3AArlen%20Specter"&gt;Arlen Specter&lt;/a&gt; (R). A &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; spokeswoman also confirmed the same. 

Sen. Specter said that the bill will clear the way for a &lt;a href="w%3AForeign%20Intelligence%20Surveillance%20Act"&gt;Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act&lt;/a&gt; (FISA) court to "consider the program as a whole and to make a decision on it."
Under the "Terrorist Surveillance Program", NSA conducts surveillance on international and domestic phone calls without FISA court authorization, an action the text of the FISA act calls a &lt;a href="w%3AFelony"&gt;Felony&lt;/a&gt;. The Bush administration maintains that the program is legal, arguing that FISA is an unconstitutional violation of the President's "inherent powers" and/or that FISA was implicitly overridden by other acts of Congress. Revelation of the program by a ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Times"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ newsreport triggered a controversy over the legality of the program and the scope of Congressional oversight. 

The Senate Judiciary Committee is currently considering two bills proposed respectively by Sen. Specter and Sen. &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20DeWine"&gt;Mike DeWine&lt;/a&gt; (R) over the issue. The Specter bill provides for retroactive amnesty for NSA's actions and brings the program under the FISA court, whereas the DeWine bill provides a legislative foundation for the program. 

Sen. Specter said that the bill will allow greater flexibility in emergencies by updating legal language to reflect recent technological developments such as cell phones, allowing NSA a seven day period for obtaining retroactive warrants and allowing "roving wiretaps" which target an individual rather than a particular phone connection. He added that the bill will require government officials to explain why they suspect intercepted communications involve terrorism and creates penalties for misuse of the powers. 

Sen. &lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Leahy"&gt;Patrick Leahy&lt;/a&gt; (D), the Judiciary Committee's ranking Democrat said that the proposed bill is an "interesting bargain" in which the President "is saying 'if you do every single thing I tell you to do,' I will do what I should have done anyway,".
Sen. &lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Schumer"&gt;Charles Schumer&lt;/a&gt; (D) is reported to have proposed a different bill.

<h1>North Carolina to see minimum wage increase</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=North%20Carolina%20to%20see%20minimum%20wage%20increase&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="North%20Carolina"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; Governor &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Easley"&gt;Mike Easley&lt;/a&gt; signed into law a new &lt;a href="w%3Aminimum%20wage"&gt;minimum wage&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; state Thursday. The increase of &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;1 will raise the rate to US$6.15. Easley said that the new law will make it easier for North Carolinians to deal with the rising cost of living. The new law will become effective on January 1 next year. This is the first raise to the North Carolina minimum wage in nearly nine years.

Last Sunday in &lt;a href="Pennsylvania"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, Governor &lt;a href="w%3AEd%20Rendell"&gt;Ed Rendell&lt;/a&gt; signed into law a phased-in US$2 minimum wage increase. For businesses with 10 employees or more, the rate will increase by US$1 on January 1 next year, then increase by another dollar on July 1.

"Signing this bill into law gives me personal gratification," said Rendell to cheering crowd of minimum wage workers at the signing ceremony in Philadelphia. The last time Pennsylvania made a change to the federally mandated minimum was in 1988. 

Recent state level legislative initiatives to raise the minimum wage have failed in 18 U.S. states, according to the National Restaurant Association.

A total of 20 other U.S. states &amp;mdash; Alaska, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin, plus the District of Columbia &amp;mdash; have raised the minimum above the federal mandate. 

The U.S. &lt;a href="w%3AFair%20Labor%20Standards%20Act"&gt;Fair Labor Standards Act&lt;/a&gt;, enacted in 1938, has been continuously amended by Congress over years with increases that make the federally mandated minimum wage what it is today, US$5.15 per hour. The last time the federal government raised the rate was in 1997.

The criminal organization known as the &lt;a href="w%3APrimeiro%20Comando%20da%20Capital"&gt;PCC&lt;/a&gt; (Primeiro Comando da Capital, Portuguese for First Command of the Capital City) is promoting a new wave of attacks against civil and authority targets in Brazil beginning early July. The main attacks are occurring in &lt;a href="w%3AS%C3%A3o%20Paulo"&gt;São Paulo&lt;/a&gt; state.

<h1>Juventus, Lazio and Fiorentina relegated from Italy's Serie A</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Juventus%2C%20Lazio%20and%20Fiorentina%20relegated%20from%20Italy%27s%20Serie%20A&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; soccer giants &lt;a href="Juventus%20FC"&gt;Juventus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AS.S.%20Lazio"&gt;Lazio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AACF%20Fiorentina"&gt;Fiorentina&lt;/a&gt; have all been relegated from &lt;a href="Serie%20A"&gt;Serie A&lt;/a&gt; today as the result of the massive Italian football match-fixing scandal, while &lt;a href="w%3AA.C.%20Milan"&gt;AC Milan&lt;/a&gt; have avoided relegation.
The news came after revelations that Juventus general manager, &lt;a href="w%3ALuciano%20Moggi"&gt;Luciano Moggi&lt;/a&gt;, had telephone conversations with several important figures in Italian football, including &lt;a href="w%3AMarcello%20Lippi"&gt;Marcello Lippi&lt;/a&gt;, the head coach of the Italian national team, during the 2004-05 season which revealed illegal match-fixing, gambling and falsifying financial accounts. The teams were accused of rigging matches by selecting referees, while players, including Italy's World Cup-winning goalkeeper &lt;a href="w%3AGianluigi%20Buffon"&gt;Gianluigi Buffon&lt;/a&gt;, have also been charged of illegally gambling on matches.

<h2>Punishments</h2>
The results were published at around 20:00 local time on July 14, 2006 and shown live on Italian television. The FIGC (&lt;a href="w%3AItalian%20Football%20Federation"&gt;Italian Football Federation&lt;/a&gt;) had originally called for all four clubs involved, AC Milan, Juventus, Lazio and Fiorentina to be thrown out of Serie A, with Juventus demoted two divisions into Serie C1.

Juventus suffered the biggest punishment. They were demoted into Italy's second division, Serie B and will start the 2006-07 season with a thirty-point deduction. They were also stripped of their league titles, or "Scudettos", they had won in 2004-05 and 2005-06. President Giovanni Cobolli Gigli stated: "This verdict is unheard of. We could have expected relegation to the second division but to be also handed a 30-point deduction is almost like relegation to the third division."

Fiorentina have also been relegated to Serie B, and will have twelve-point deduction. Lazio will join Juventus and Fiorentina in Serie B next season and will have a seven-point deduction.

AC Milan have avoided relegation but will start next season with minus fifteen points. They have also had 44 points deducted from their total in the 2005-06 season to put them out of the Champions League and &lt;a href="w%3AUEFA%20Cup"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt; qualification places.

Several officials, but no players, from each club has also been suspended from football, including now ex-general manager Luciano Moggi and ex-chief executive Antonio Giraudo, both of Juventus, who have been banned for five years. The other three clubs have also had board members suspended for between one and four years.

All four sides have been barred from playing in European competitions next season and will have up to three days to appeal. &lt;a href="w%3AUEFA"&gt;UEFA&lt;/a&gt; have given the FIGC a deadline of 25 July to finalise their European qualifying teams

<h2>Consequences</h2>
The results of the match-fixing trial could have huge consequences on football in the whole of Europe, let alone Italy. Thirteen of Italy's squad which had won the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup"&gt;World Cup&lt;/a&gt; less than a week before play their club football for one of the accused teams and the rulings could spark a massive sell-out. 12 Juventus players went to the World Cup, including five for Italy. AC Milan also had thirteen players at the World Cup.

The suspensions mean that a total rehaul of Italy's European qualifiers has been made. &lt;a href="w%3AInternazionale%20Milano%20F.C."&gt;Internazionale&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AA.S.%20Roma"&gt;Roma&lt;/a&gt; will qualify for the &lt;a href="w%3AUEFA%20Champions%20League%202006-07"&gt;Champions League&lt;/a&gt; Group Stages, with &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Citt%C3%A0%20di%20Palermo"&gt;Palermo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AA.C.%20ChievoVerona"&gt;Chievo&lt;/a&gt; going into the Third Qualifying Round. &lt;a href="w%3AA.S.%20Livorno%20Calcio"&gt;Livorno&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AEmpoli%20F.C."&gt;Empoli&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AParma%20F.C."&gt;Parma&lt;/a&gt; will all qualify for the &lt;a href="w%3AUEFA%20Cup%202006-07"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt; first round.

The original relegated trio of &lt;a href="w%3AF.C.%20Messina%20Peloro"&gt;Messina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Lecce"&gt;Lecce&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATreviso%20F.B.C.%201993"&gt;Treviso&lt;/a&gt; have all been reprieved and will play in Serie A next season as another consequence of the scandal.

<h1>Suicide bomber assassinates prominent Shia cleric in Karachi, Pakistan</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Suicide%20bomber%20assassinates%20prominent%20Shia%20cleric%20in%20Karachi%2C%20Pakistan&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A suicide attacker detonated a bomb near the home of a prominent &lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;i &lt;a href="w%3AShia"&gt;Shia&lt;/a&gt; Muslim cleric in &lt;a href="w%3AKarachi"&gt;Karachi&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, killing the cleric and two other people, police said. 

The death of Allama Hassan Turabi is likely to raise tensions in Karachi, which is often the scene of violence between Shias and &lt;a href="w%3ASunnis"&gt;Sunnis&lt;/a&gt;. Allama Turabi had narrowly escaped an attempt on his life in April 2006 when a bomb was exploded just after his car crossed the area. He was the leader of a Shia party, Islami Tehreek Pakistan, and a vice provincial chief for &lt;a href="w%3AMuttahida%20Majlis-e-Amal"&gt;Mutahida Majlis-e-Amal Sindh&lt;/a&gt; (MMA), an opposition religious coalition. 

Manzoor Mughal, a police investigator, said a lone attacker on foot had detonated the bomb at the gate of Allama Turabi's house as he was getting into a car. He died of his injuries at a private hospital in Karachi, and his guard, a cousin, and the attacker, were also killed. It was initially reported that the attacker was in a car. Mr Mughal said police had collected body parts, including the head of the attacker. 

About 300 youths gathered near Allama Turabi's house after the blast, weeping and chanting slogans against the US and Israel. Reports said that public buses were damaged and set alight in disturbances following the killing, and one person was reported killed. Hours before the attack, Allama Turabi had addressed an anti-&lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; rally organised by the MMA. The MMA is strongly opposed to the US led &lt;a href="w%3AWar%20on%20Terror"&gt;War on Terror&lt;/a&gt; and Pakistan's support of it.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; has bounced back from their 12-32 loss against the &lt;a href="w%3AAll%20Blacks"&gt;All Blacks&lt;/a&gt; a week ago, to defeat the &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Africa%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;South African Springboks&lt;/a&gt; 49-0 in the second round of the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Tri%20Nations%20Series"&gt;2006 Tri Nations rugby union series&lt;/a&gt;. Australia scored six &lt;a href="w%3Atry"&gt;tries&lt;/a&gt;, two to inside centre &lt;a href="w%3AMatt%20Giteau"&gt;Matt Giteau&lt;/a&gt;, as they recorded their largest win over South Africa. It was the first time a team had been held scoreless in the Tri Nations since South Africa's 28-0 loss to the All Blacks in Dunedin in 1999, and the margin was one point shy of the Springboks' worst defeat in their history, a 53-3 rout by &lt;a href="w%3AEngland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3ATwickenham%20Stadium"&gt;Twickenham&lt;/a&gt; in 2002.

The Wallabies made four changes to their starting lineup that lost to the All Blacks the week before. Hooker &lt;a href="w%3AJeremy%20Paul"&gt;Jeremy Paul&lt;/a&gt;, No. 8 &lt;a href="w%3AScott%20Fava"&gt;Scott Fava&lt;/a&gt; and inside center Giteau were all moved into the starting lineup, with &lt;a href="w%3ARocky%20Elsom"&gt;Rocky Elsom&lt;/a&gt; moving to blindside flanker. Queensland prop &lt;a href="w%3ARodney%20Blake"&gt;Rodney Blake&lt;/a&gt; was expected to return for the Wallabies, but failed to recover from injury in time. The Springboks, playing their first Tri Nations match of the season, introduced two un-capped players; &lt;a href="w%3ABulls%20%28rugby%20club%29"&gt;Bulls&lt;/a&gt; winger &lt;a href="w%3AAkona%20Ndugane"&gt;Akona Ndugane&lt;/a&gt; and No. 8 &lt;a href="w%3APierre%20Spies"&gt;Pierre Spies&lt;/a&gt;.

The first points of the match were scored by &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Larkham"&gt;Stephen Larkham&lt;/a&gt;, who landed an early drop goal for Australia. &lt;a href="w%3AGreg%20Holmes"&gt;Greg Holmes&lt;/a&gt;, Paul and Giteau all scored tries in the first half. Giteau grabbed a double, scoring his second try in the second half, along with fullback &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Latham"&gt;Chris Latham&lt;/a&gt;, and replacement lock &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Chisholm"&gt;Mark Chisholm&lt;/a&gt;. In total, &lt;a href="w%3AStirling%20Mortlock"&gt;Stirling Mortlock&lt;/a&gt; racked up 18 points through conversions of tries and penalty goals. The match was played at &lt;a href="w%3ABrisbane"&gt;Brisbane&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ASuncorp%20Stadium"&gt;Suncorp Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, in mostly fine conditions, though the second half was covered in light rain. Next week South Africa will meet the All Blacks.

In &lt;a href="w%3AYucca%20Valley%2C%20California"&gt;Yucca Valley&lt;/a&gt;, California, USA, &lt;a href="w%3Awildfire"&gt;wildfires&lt;/a&gt; destroyed nearly 110 square miles of land (285 square km), burning over 45,000 acres (182 square km), as the outcome of two wildfires merging into one. Current conditions could only make it worse.

Over 3,000 &lt;a href="w%3Afirefighter"&gt;firefighters&lt;/a&gt; and 36 aircraft were sent to fight the blaze, which some predicted would reach all the way to Big Lear Lake, a popular summer getaway vacation area, about 80 miles east of &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%2C%20California"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; (129 km). Temperatures there reached up to 112°F (44.5°C).

Firefighters fighting the wildfire have successfully stopped it from burning the resort and other communities nearby in its path.

The continuous winds and the intense heat would only mean that the blaze would last even longer and call for more firefighters to overtake the flames.

California Governor &lt;a href="w%3AArnold%20Schwarzenegger"&gt;Arnold Schwarzenegger&lt;/a&gt; has declared a state of emergency for San Bernardino County as a result of the wildfires.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=United%20Nations%20Security%20Council%20imposes%20sanctions%20on%20North%20Korea&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council"&gt;Security Council&lt;/a&gt; has unanimously voted to impose sanctions related to weapons on &lt;a href="North%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;.

The resolution demands that North Korea 'suspend all activities related to its ballistic missile program.

The resolution requires all &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20member%20states"&gt;UN member states&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to prevent imports from or exports to North Korea of missiles and missile-related items as well as materials that could be used in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWMD"&gt;weapons of mass destruction.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 

However, in order to keep &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; from vetoing the resolution, the resolution was not passed under &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChapter%20VII%20of%20the%20United%20Nations%20Charter"&gt;Chapter 7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AU.N.%20Charter"&gt;U.N. Charter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which is used on a legally binding document. However, the resolution is considered mandatory because of the way it is worded. 

China and &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; proposed a resolution with weaker language, but later agreed to this tougher resolution.

North Korean ambassador to UN &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APak%20Kil-yon"&gt;Pak Kil-yon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; spoke after the vote and criticized some members of the Security Council for attempting to isolate &lt;a href="North%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;. He also vowed that North Korea will continue with its missile testings.

The Royal Navy aircraft carrier &lt;a href="w%3AHMS%20Illustrious%20%28R06%29"&gt;HMS Illustrious&lt;/a&gt; and landing ship &lt;a href="w%3AHMS%20Bulwark%20%28L15%29"&gt;HMS Bulwark&lt;/a&gt; have been ordered to 'make ready' to sail to &lt;a href="w%3ALebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;. It is reported that &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; ministers are considering plans to evacuate UK citizens who are trapped there due to the &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israeli&lt;/a&gt; naval blocade of Lebanese ports and the closure of &lt;a href="w%3ABeirut"&gt;Beirut&lt;/a&gt; airport on 13th July after Israeli airstrikes. It is also reported that they will help any &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; citizens as New Zealand does not have an embassy.

HMS Bulwark is currently off the coast of Spain and HMS Illustrious is in &lt;a href="w%3AGibraltar"&gt;Gibraltar&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3AForeign%20and%20Commonwealth%20Office"&gt;UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office&lt;/a&gt; has advised UK citizens in Lebanon to "stay put for the time being and keep a low profile". They are advised to keep in touch with the British Embassy and to be ready for 'departure' at short notice as well as to have travel documents ready.

The move comes as the crisis between Israel and Lebanon approaches its fifth day.

<h1>Labour peer tells Blair to step down as Prime Minister</h1>

&lt;a href="w%3ALord%20Hattersley"&gt;Lord Hattersley&lt;/a&gt;, the former deputy leader of the &lt;a href="w%3ALabour%20party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Labour party&lt;/a&gt;, has said &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; should stand down as British &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; in September.

He said the party would be damaged if Mr Blair remained in &lt;a href="w%3ADowning%20Street"&gt;Downing Street&lt;/a&gt; after this year's Labour conference, which will be held in &lt;a href="w%3AManchester"&gt;Manchester&lt;/a&gt; in two months' time. 

"The Prime Minister ought not to announce he's going at party conference - he ought to go at party conference," he told GMTV's Sunday Programme. "The longer he stays on, the more damaging it is for him as well as the party in my view."

The Labour peer said Mr Blair should highlight the successes his party has achieved since gaining power in 1997. "Then he should say the time has come to pass the torch on to somebody else and thank the party for what they've done. ... If we did that I think he’d go out on a high note in the party. I think that'll ripple out through the country." 

Lord Hattersley, who was the former &lt;a href="w%3AMP"&gt;MP&lt;/a&gt; for Birmingham Sparkbrook, added that Scottish chancellor &lt;a href="w%3AGordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt; was the best heir to Mr Blair. "I think Gordon Brown increasingly becomes the ideal next leader of the Labour party," he said.

"I think what the Labour party needs to win the next election is a solemn, serious, if you like, son of the manse."

"Somebody with visibly and almost ostentatiously contemptuous of spin who wants simply to say it as it is," he added.

But Mr Blair, who is currently in &lt;a href="w%3ASt%20Petersburg"&gt;St Petersburg&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href="w%3AG8%20summit"&gt;G8 summit&lt;/a&gt;, said he would be Prime Minister when the gathering is held again next summer.

"I've made it clear all the way through that I'll carry on doing the job," he told BBC One's The Politics Show today.

&lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Democrat"&gt;Liberal Democrat&lt;/a&gt; party president &lt;a href="w%3ASimon%20Hughes"&gt;Simon Hughes&lt;/a&gt; said: "Roy Hattersley's call for the prime minister to go this year just piles on the pressure. 

"Every month that passes looks more and more like the end of the Blair era. The chosen date for going is, of course, a personal decision and principally a Labour party concern. 

"But good government for Britain and our reputation abroad requires a prime minister with a future not a past, and a prime minister who commands authority in his party as well as the support of the British people." 

<h2>Cash-for-honours</h2>

Lord Hattersley also said in the interview that recent &lt;a href="w%3ACash%20for%20peerages"&gt;cash-for-honours&lt;/a&gt; claims were "deeply damaging" to Labour. 

The party's chief fundraiser and Middle East envoy, &lt;a href="w%3ALord%20Levy"&gt;Lord Levy&lt;/a&gt;, was this week arrested and bailed by the &lt;a href="w%3AMetropolitan%20Police"&gt;Metropolitan Police&lt;/a&gt; over allegations he was nominated for a peerage after lending money to the party before the last election. 

But Tony Blair has said there is nothing wrong with peerages being given to party backers.

"Nobody in the Labour party to my knowledge has sold honours or sold peerages," Mr Blair told The Politics Show. 

"The fact that is sometimes excluded from the public's mind in relation to this debate is that there are places in the House of Lords that are reserved for party nominees for their party supporters." 

Police are also investigating the Conservative party and the Liberal Democrats to see if they have given peerages in return for money.

Ferrari driver &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Schumacher"&gt;Michael Schumacher&lt;/a&gt; won the &lt;a href="w%3AFIA"&gt;FIA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFormula-1"&gt;Formula-1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20French%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;French Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="w%3ACircuit%20de%20Nevers%20Magny-Cours"&gt;Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours&lt;/a&gt;. 

With the help of a different pit-stop strategy &lt;a href="w%3ARenault"&gt;Renault&lt;/a&gt; driver &lt;a href="w%3AFernando%20Alonso"&gt;Fernando Alonso&lt;/a&gt; took second ahead of the other Ferrari of &lt;a href="w%3AFelipe%20Massa"&gt;Felipe Massa&lt;/a&gt;. Massa had lead Alonso during the initial part of the race. 

&lt;a href="w%3AToyota"&gt;Toyota&lt;/a&gt; did not live up to their promise in the qualifying session on Saturday with only one car finished, that of &lt;a href="w%3ARalf%20Schumacher"&gt;Ralf Schumacher&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3ATeam%20McLaren"&gt;McLaren&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3AMercedes"&gt;Mercedes&lt;/a&gt; driver &lt;a href="w%3AKimi%20Raikkonen"&gt;Kimi Raikkonen&lt;/a&gt; finished fifth. &lt;a href="w%3APedro%20de%20la%20Rosa"&gt;Pedro de la Rosa&lt;/a&gt; finished seventh. 

This was de la Rosa's first race this season. He had replaced &lt;a href="w%3AJuan-Pablo%20Montoya"&gt;Juan-Pablo Montoya&lt;/a&gt; in the McLaren hot seat, who left the team to start a career in &lt;a href="w%3ANASCAR"&gt;NASCAR&lt;/a&gt; in the US.

This victory is the 150-th podium finish for Michael Schumacher, and cut down Alonso's lead in the championship race to 17 points. It was his eighth French Grand Prix victory - the first driver to win a Grand Prix eight times, which surpassed his own record of seven.

A heat wave in the &lt;a href="w%3Aupper%20Midwest"&gt;upper Midwest&lt;/a&gt; has people trying to stay cool, while the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20National%20Guard"&gt;National Guard&lt;/a&gt; is activated by &lt;a href="w%3AMinnesota"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGovernor%20of%20Minnesota"&gt;Governor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATim%20Pawlenty"&gt;Tim Pawlenty&lt;/a&gt; to fight a new &lt;a href="w%3Awildfire"&gt;wildfire&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3ABoundary%20Waters%20Canoe%20Area%20Wilderness"&gt;Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness&lt;/a&gt;. 

Temperatures cracked 100 degrees &lt;a href="w%3AFahrenheit"&gt;Fahrenheit&lt;/a&gt; (38 &lt;a href="w%3ACelsius"&gt;Celsius&lt;/a&gt;) in &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Paul%2C%20Minnesota"&gt;St. Paul, Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;, and reached a record-breaking 96 degrees Fahrenheit (35.5 Celsius) in &lt;a href="w%3ADuluth%2C%20Minnesota"&gt;Duluth, Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;.

Smoke was spotted Friday afternoon in the wilderness area about one mile southwest of Seagull Lake. This area of the 1 million acre wilderness was hit by a &lt;a href="w%3ABoundary%20Waters-Canadian%20Derecho"&gt;severe windstorm&lt;/a&gt; in 1999, which killed millions of trees, increasing concern about the future threat of wildfires.

Firefighters are not yet on the ground, as the fire is located in a remote area inaccessible by trails or lakes. &lt;a href="w%3AUH-60"&gt;Helicopters&lt;/a&gt; have been called in to begin suppression efforts immediately.

Jean Bergerson, spokesperson for the Minnesota Inter-agency Fire Center, described the blaze as "well over 1,000" acres in size. The cause of the fire is not yet known.

♡❤♡UPDATE:♡❤♡ &lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Near-record%20heat%20in%20Minnesota%20brings%20wildfire%20to%20the%20Boundary%20Waters&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The flames continue to rage in Northern Minnesota as the fire expands by the hour, now engulfing more than 6,000 acres of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area, as reported by the Minneapolis Star Tribune today. 

The purported cause of the fire is a lightning strike.

There are now over 60 firefighters stationed on the ground near the fire, though it is still considered too dangerous to combat the blaze directly.

This is the largest fire to take place in Minnesota in years, and has now spread to within 3 miles of the Gunflint Trail, though the trail may be protected by controlled burn zones put in place in recent years by the US Forest Service. 

Govenor Tim Pawlenty plans a fly-over of the afflicted area.

&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Ministry%20of%20Defence"&gt;The Ministry of Defence&lt;/a&gt; has named the British soldier who died after a mission in the northern area of &lt;a href="w%3ABasra"&gt;Basra&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. 

27 year-old Corporal John Johnston Cosby, of the 1st Battalion Devonshire and Dorset Light Infantry, was one of two servicemen who sustained gunshot wounds after coming under fire by suspected terrorists in the Garmat Ali tribal area on Saturday. 

"It is with great regret that we can confirm one of the soldiers has subsequently died of these injuries," said a statement issued by the Ministry of Defence. 

"Our thoughts and sympathies are with the family at this difficult time. The other soldier's injuries are not life-threatening."

&lt;a href="w%3ADefence%20Secretary"&gt;Defence Secretary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADes%20Browne"&gt;Des Browne&lt;/a&gt; said the soldier’s death was "terribly sad". 

"I would like to offer my deepest condolences to their family and friends," he said. "I wish the soldier who was injured a speedy recovery and pay tribute to the bravery of both troops."

Two men suspected of being involved with serious crime and terrorism were detained as a result of the operation. 

According to Major Charlie Burbridge, a British forces spokesman, the intelligence-led operation's objective had been achieved. "We have been pleased with the outcome of the operation - it went according to plan. But we do mourn the loss of one of our soldiers."

So far, 114 British troops have died in Iraq.

Elsewhere in the country today, at least 19 Iraqi civilians were killed and 25 injured in a suicide bomb attack in a crowded cafe. The attack took place in the town of Tuz Khurmatu, which is 50 miles from Kirkuk.

The international nature of the crisis between &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AHezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt; was discussed in an emergency summit of the Arab League in Cairo, Egypt, Saturday, and by &lt;a href="w%3AG8"&gt;Group of Eight&lt;/a&gt; leaders in St Petersburg, Russia, Sunday.

The &lt;a href="w%3AArab%20League"&gt;Arab League&lt;/a&gt; failed to reach an agreement on the issue while the Group of Eight released a joint statement. The Arab League released three separate statements on Lebanon.

The meetings came after Hezbollah attacked Israel on July 12, killing six soldiers and kidnapping two. Israel retaliated by attacking Lebanon, which lead to over 100 civilian deaths. Hezbollah has fired 700 missiles across the border, causing civilian casualties in Israeli towns, including Haifa.

<h2>Arab League</h2>
On Saturday, the Arab League convened a one-day meeting on the crisis in the Levant in Cairo, together with member countries' foreign ministers, on the invitation of Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa. 

The Council of Arab Foreign Ministers failed to reach an agreement on a joint statement about the conflict and instead released separate statements.

"We're facing the prospect of a total security collapse in the region," said the Secretary-General of the Arab League. Amr Moussa also said the peace process in the region was "dead."

"The peace process in the Middle East was killed. All mechanisms, including the &lt;a href="w%3AQuartet%20on%20the%20Middle%20East"&gt;Middle East Quartet&lt;/a&gt; (Russia, US, UN and EU) have canceled the peace process.”

During the discussions the Arab League promised Lebanon “unconditional support.”

There was, however, disagreement over Hezbollah. &lt;a href="w%3ASaudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi&lt;/a&gt; Foreign Minister al-Faisal accused Hezbollah of “inappropriate and irresponsible” behaviour and was supported in his view by delegates from &lt;a href="w%3AEgypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJordan"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AKuwait"&gt;Kuwait&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APalestine"&gt;Palestine&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Arab%20Emirates"&gt;United Arab Emirates&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABahrain"&gt;Bahrain&lt;/a&gt;. 

The &lt;a href="w%3ASyria"&gt;Syrian&lt;/a&gt; delegate Velid Muallim disagreed.

<h2>Group of Eight</h2>
Group of Eight leaders met in St Petersburg on Sunday and worked out a joint statement on the crisis in the Levant.

While they asked Israel to stop attacking Lebanon and "an early withdrawal" from Gaza they demanded Hezbollah release the taken Israeli soldiers and stop their attacks on Israel. "The extremists must immediately halt their attacks," said the leaders in the jointly-released statement but also Israel should release the recently arrested Palestinian ministers and parliamentarians.

The Group of Eight leaders also accepted Israel's right to defend against attacks - as long as they did so proportionally. 

The joint statement was summarised with the four following points

<ul>
BULLET::::- Israeli soldiers in Gaza and Lebanon should be returned, unharmed;
BULLET::::- The attacks into Israeli territory should stop;
BULLET::::- Israeli military operations must end and Israeli forces must make "an early withdrawal" from Gaza;
BULLET::::- The arrested Palestinian ministers and parliamentarians must be released.

</ul>
Israel welcomed the statement.

"Israel concurs with the position of the international community, which places responsibility for the conflict on extremist elements," said Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni.

<h1>Seven Canadians killed by Israeli air strike</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Seven%20Canadians%20killed%20by%20Israeli%20air%20strike&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Seven Canadians were killed, and six others were in critical condition, after an Israeli raid in Lebanon on Sunday, &lt;a href="w%3AMinister%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%20%28Canada%29"&gt;Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20MacKay"&gt;Peter MacKay&lt;/a&gt; announced. The deaths were believed to be the first recent casualties in Lebanon from any G8 country. 

Associated Press reports anonymous Lebanese officials saying the family of Canadians were killed at their home in the town of Aitaroun. Many Lebanese citizens have emigrated to Canada and often return to spend their summers in the south of Lebanon. 

Sixteen thousand Canadians have registered with the embassy in Beirut, but MacKay said the number of those present could be as high as 40,000. "We're calling for restraint in all sectors right now and hope to be able to have those ships in place and citizens moving out of Lebanon as quickly as possible." MacKay said. 

Parliament Hill demonstrators in Ottawa on Sunday protested the Harper government's position regarding the ongoing strikes. One placard declared, "Killing children is not a 'measured response'," referring to the G8 statement released earlier.

During a protest in Montréal on Sunday, one woman said she had just been informed that two of her family members were killed in the Israeli air strike. The unnamed woman screamed "My father, my uncle — they're dead. What's happening?" She said her family members were in the Middle East for a summer vacation.

The deaths occurred on the fifth day of Israel's military attacks in Lebanon, instigated by the capture of 2 Israeli soldiers and killing of 8 others by the Shiite &lt;a href="Hezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt; in a cross-border attack. The fighting has caused at least 148 fatalities in Lebanon and 23 in Israel.

Michael Byers, who holds the &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; Research Chair in Global Politics and International Law at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20British%20Columbia"&gt;University of British Columbia&lt;/a&gt;, revealed in Sunday's ♡❤Toronto Star♡❤ that while he was in Tel Aviv in 2004, he met with a lawyer who advises the &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael%20Defence%20Force"&gt;Defence Force&lt;/a&gt; about rules of engagement. Scenarios which were unfolding were discussed. 

The ♡❤Toronto Star♡❤ reported a conversation between Byers and an IDF colonel / lawyer during a luncheon. According to Byers, the colonel felt that attacks on southern &lt;a href="Lebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; and civilian targets as well as Lebanese infrastructure would be justified under specific interpretations and in certain circumstances. She asked Byers for his opinion on these matters.

The lawyer Byers met with is a colonel with a Harvard doctorate. He met with her by an invitation that came while he was a visiting professor at the University of Tel Aviv. After just a few minutes, the Harvard graduated colonel got to the point of their meeting: 

"There have been a number of missile attacks along our northern border," she said. "We're going to respond with air strikes against some Hezbollah installations in southern Lebanon next week. What do you think?" 

Byers said he was taken aback as governments rarely consult foreign academics about their military plans. Though it was not clear whether the colonel was engaged in private conversation or asking for the professor's services on behalf of the military.

Byers responded; "Well, for starters, any act of self-defence has to be necessary and proportionate."

Byers advised the colonel, "Also, you must never target civilians or facilities such as water-filtration or electrical plants relied upon by civilians." 

"Ah, here we disagree!" the colonel exclaimed. "Collateral damage is allowed in situations of military necessity. And dual-use facilities are legitimate targets."

"What constitutes military necessity depends on the relative capabilities of the opposing forces," Byers responded, "And the dual-use argument is a slippery slope."

"Perhaps." the Israeli colonel said. 

"There's a second reason you should do everything possible to protect civilians," Byers advised. "Israel has to work particularly hard to maintain the moral high ground. Your reputation has suffered because of your treatment of the Palestinians."

"We're completely justified in our treatment of the Palestinians," the colonel said.

"We can disagree on that," Byers said, "but do me a favour, as someone who wants to sympathize with Israel. If you do launch air strikes, please limit yourself to Hezbollah facilities. Leave civilians — and the Lebanese government — alone."

Two years ago, Byers' IDF advisor suggested considering southern Lebanon a failed state was justification for incursions and air strikes. In contrast, speaking about the current crisis, Israel's Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said the recent cross-border attack by Hezbollah was an "act of war" committed by the government of Lebanon and that, "The events this morning are not terror attacks but actions of a sovereign state that attacked Israel for no reason. The Lebanese government, of which Hezbollah is a member, is trying to destabilize regional stability. Lebanon is responsible and it will bear responsibility."

Israel's defense ministry confirmed it held Lebanon "directly responsible" for their fate and safe return of the two soldiers captured by Hezbollah. The Israeli Defense Ministry issued a statement which said; "The Lebanese government is responsible for the fate of the Israeli soldiers, and must take immediate action to locate them without harming them and return them to Israel."

South-east &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; has been flooded by torrential rainstorms as the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Pacific%20typhoon%20season%23Severe_Tropical_Storm_Bilis_%28Florita%29"&gt;Severe Tropical Storm Bilis&lt;/a&gt; came ashore on Friday, July 14. The total death toll stands at 178 people but many people are missing, and the figure might rise.

Floods, 10 meters high in some areas washed away 19,100 houses, damaged roads, power lines, and devastated villages and agriculture. Three million people were affected by the tropical storm which Xinhua, the state news agency, estimated would cost three billion yuan ($375 million) damage.

The worse-hit provinces were &lt;a href="w%3AFujian"&gt;Fujian&lt;/a&gt;, Hunan and &lt;a href="w%3AGuangdong"&gt;Guangdong&lt;/a&gt; while their were deaths and an economic impact in &lt;a href="w%3AZhejian"&gt;Zhejian&lt;/a&gt;, Jiangxi and Guangxi provinces.

At least 92 died in Hunan where dam reservoirs rose to their limits. The water swell in Leiyang rose 10 metres above the levels from Friday. 

40,000 people in the cities of &lt;a href="w%3AHengyang"&gt;Hengyang&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AChenzhou"&gt;Chenzhou&lt;/a&gt; were reported stranded. 14 coal miners died when a dam burst, ravaging the land and flooding their pit at Shenjiawan Colliery.

The floods in Hunan also took out the Beijing-Guangzhou railway leaving 5,000 stranded in the capital, &lt;a href="w%3AChangsha"&gt;Changsha&lt;/a&gt;. 10,000 workers were sent to repair the damaged sections of line.

An estimated 33 people died in Guangdong, an important economic area near &lt;a href="w%3AHong%20Kong"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3ALechang"&gt;Lechang&lt;/a&gt; was submerged under three metres of water and 1663 prisoners had to be moved from the city.

In Fujian province 43 people are reported dead. Deadly mudslides killed 10 in the city of &lt;a href="w%3AZhangzhou"&gt;Zhangzhou&lt;/a&gt; and another 10 are missing from a second mudslide.

<h1>New Zealand government withdraws asset forfeiture bill</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=New%20Zealand%20government%20withdraws%20asset%20forfeiture%20bill&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The New Zealand government has withdrawn its &lt;a href="http%3A//www.knowledge-basket.co.nz/gpprint/docs/bills/20052791.txt"&gt;Criminal Proceeds and Instruments Bill&lt;/a&gt; from Parliament, putting on hold its plans to introduce a non-conviction-based &lt;a href="w%3AAsset%20forfeiture"&gt;asset forfeiture&lt;/a&gt; regime.

The bill was introduced to &lt;a href="w%3AParliament%20of%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Parliament&lt;/a&gt; in June last year, and was removed from the Parliamentary &lt;a href="http%3A//publications.clerk.parliament.govt.nz.clients.intergen.net.nz/Attachments/OrderPaper.pdf"&gt;Order Paper&lt;/a&gt; in the last week, before it had even received a first reading vote.

A spokesperson for the Minister of Justice refused to give a reason for the bill's withdrawal, saying only that there were "a couple of procedural issues that need to be dealt with". 

The bill would establish a non-conviction-based asset forfeiture regime, which would allow the government to confiscate the assets of those suspected of involvement in serious crime. Suspected criminals would be required to prove on the balance of probabilities that their assets were legally acquired or else forfeit them to the crown. No criminal conviction would be required. 

The scheme has attracted criticism from both sides of the House, with the &lt;a href="w%3Ahttp%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_of_Aotearoa_New_Zealand"&gt;Green Party&lt;/a&gt; calling it "an affront to the principles of justice and law", and the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20National%20Party"&gt;National Party&lt;/a&gt; demanding a much tougher regime. Given the stated positions of parties on the bill, the most likely reason for its withdrawal is that the government does not have a majority to pass it in its present form.

Robert Brooks, chairman of &lt;a href="w%3AHooters%20of%20America%2C%20Inc"&gt;Hooters of America, Inc&lt;/a&gt;. who was famous for opening a restaurant selling chicken wings by scantily clad waitresses, was found dead yesterday, police said. Brooks was 69 years old. An autopsy is waiting to be performed later on today.

Since opening its first store in &lt;a href="w%3AClearwater%2C%20Florida"&gt;Clearwater, Florida&lt;/a&gt; in 1983, the chain has expanded across the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and into more than a dozen foreign countries. At last count, Hooters had 425 restaurants nationwide.

Brooks was named Entrepreneur of the Year by the Georgia Chamber of Commerce in 1996.

Lois Dear, a 66-year-old teacher at Strathmore Primary School, &lt;a href="w%3ATokoroa"&gt;Tokoroa&lt;/a&gt;, has been murdered in her classroom at about noon on Sunday. She was found by two of her colleagues, lying face down. &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Police"&gt;New Zealand Police&lt;/a&gt; say that the teacher had suffered head injuries, and her death was 'nasty'. 

The police currently have no suspects.

School was supposed to return back to start term 3 but today the school was cordoned and being guarded by police while the 278 pupils got the day off.

The body was not removed from the scene until noon today, Monday 17, when it was carried off to a hearse and a &lt;a href="w%3Akarakia"&gt;karakia&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AMaori"&gt;Maori&lt;/a&gt; prayer) was performed in front of 70 people.

Staff will be offered counselling.

Ngaire Taikato, a colleague of Ms Dear, told ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANewstalk%20ZB"&gt;Newstalk ZB&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ "the school has been devastated at the killing. It will take a long time for the children at the school to get over Ms Dear's death, and a lot of counselling will be needed. Dear was never in the staff room, because she was always out with the children who loved and respected her."

The school will no longer let teachers work by themselves out of school hours, the school will introduce a buddy system, for the teachers safety. However Pat Newman, New Zealand Principals' Association president, said "schools are generally secure places where teachers can work safely on their own."

Murray Kendrick, principal of Strathmore Primary School, said "the school had had the occasional break-in but no major problems." Detective Sergeant Karl Thornton, the officer in charge of the investigation, said "It was too soon to say whether robbery could be behind the attack."

<h1>Indonesia's president visits victims of tsunami</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Indonesia%27s%20president%20visits%20victims%20of%20tsunami&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Indonesia's President, &lt;a href="w%3ASusilo%20Bambang%20Yudhoyono"&gt;Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono&lt;/a&gt;, visited the area worst hit by the tsunami that struck the &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesian&lt;/a&gt; island of &lt;a href="w%3AJava"&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt; Monday afternoon. Mr Yudhoyono toured the small town of &lt;a href="w%3APangandaran"&gt;Pangandaran&lt;/a&gt; meeting people who were staying in a temporary camp. Many of them are too scared to return home after the huge wave killed nearly 550 people. The &lt;a href="w%3ATsunami"&gt;tsunami&lt;/a&gt; was produced by an underwater &lt;a href="w%3Aearthquake"&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt; with a magnitude of 7.7 on the &lt;a href="w%3ARichter%20scale"&gt;Richter scale&lt;/a&gt;.

At the camp, Mr Yudhoyono told one woman to "be strong". According to a relief worker, about 3,000 people have taken refuge at the site, but only about 500 of them have lost their homes. She said people are too scared to go home because they live on the coast, a sentiment shared by one woman who told &lt;a href="w%3AAFP"&gt;AFP&lt;/a&gt;: "I did not lose my home, and my husband and child are safe, but we are still traumatised by the tsunami and are too afraid to return home in case another one comes."

&lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Java"&gt;West Java&lt;/a&gt; Governor Danny Setiawan told journalists that officials are persuading people to return home, and he said a return to normality "could take five to six years".

Aid workers are working to provide relief to the 15,500 people who have been left homeless as a result of the two-meter high wave. Yesterday, 15 tonnes of &lt;a href="w%3Arice"&gt;rice&lt;/a&gt; and 1,600 boxes of &lt;a href="w%3Ainstant%20noodles"&gt;instant noodles&lt;/a&gt; were dropped, but some residents have said government assistance is necessary for them to regain their livelihoods. One woman told &lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;, "I don’t have anything, only 5,000 &lt;a href="w%3Arupiah"&gt;rupiah&lt;/a&gt; (£0.30, $0.55) in my wallet. The government should give us money to buy houses and a boat."

It is estimated over 300 people are still missing, and the army and police are using helicopters, boats and mechanical diggers in the hope of recovering survivors. Lieutenant Colonel Tri Yuniarta has told his 350-strong rescue team in Pangandaran to finish collecting bodies trapped under debris by next Monday. 

The Indonesian government has been criticised for failing to inform residents that a tsunami was looming. After the underwater earthquake was detected, &lt;a href="w%3AUS"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt; agencies issued warning notices, but the government has admitted it was unable to transmit the bulletins to coastal areas. Speaking yesterday, Mr Yudhoyono vowed to hasten efforts to build an early warning system planned after the &lt;a href="w%3A2004%20Asian%20tsunami"&gt;2004 Asian tsunami&lt;/a&gt;. "We want to expedite efforts to get infrastructure for the tsunami warning system in place," &lt;a href="w%3AAP"&gt;AP&lt;/a&gt; quoted him as saying. "I will work with parliament to get the budget".

Survivors have described the tsunami, which struck a 200km stretch of &lt;a href="w%3AJava"&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt;'s southern coast. A &lt;a href="w%3ABelgium"&gt;Belgian&lt;/a&gt; tourist said he was in a beach side bar when the wave hit. "I saw this big cloud of dark sea water coming up to me".

Indonesia is situated on the &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Rim%20of%20Fire"&gt;Pacific Rim of Fire&lt;/a&gt; where 90% of the world's earthquakes and 81% of the world's largest earthquakes occur.

The leaders of the &lt;a href="w%3AGroup%20of%20Eight"&gt;Group of Eight&lt;/a&gt; (G8) nations met over the weekend in &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Petersburg"&gt;St. Petersburg&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; for the 32nd G8 Summit, held under Russia's presidency, to discuss the ongoing Israel-Lebanon crisis, the stalled world trade talks and other issues. They also met with other world leaders, the UN Secretary General &lt;a href="Kofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt; and World Trade Organisation chief &lt;a href="w%3APascal%20Lamy"&gt;Pascal Lamy&lt;/a&gt;. 

<h2>Israel-Lebanon crisis</h2>
The G8 leaders issued a statement expressing "deepening concern" over &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Israel-Lebanon%20conflict"&gt;the unfolding crisis&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AHezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt; militants operating out of &lt;a href="Lebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; continued their attacks which have already killed scores. 

<h3>G8 Statement on the crisis</h3>
The statement called for the safe return of the captured Israeli soldiers and restraint from Israel in its military actions. 

The statement said the "root cause" of the crisis was the "absence of a comprehensive Middle East peace", but "extremist elements and those that support them cannot be allowed to plunge the Middle East into chaos,".

The statement noted the rising civilian casualties on all sides and damage to infrastructure and called for an end to violence.

The statement called for the safe return of the Israeli soldiers who were abducted in &lt;a href="w%3AGaza"&gt;Gaza&lt;/a&gt; and Lebanon, an end to shelling of Israeli territory, asking Hezbollah to make the first move to end the crisis.
It urged Israel to be mindful of "the strategic and humanitarian consequences of its actions" and "to exercise utmost restraint, seeking to avoid casualties among innocent civilians and damage to civilian infrastructure and to refrain from acts that would destabilize the Lebanese government." It also called for an end to Israeli military operations, withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and the release of the arrested Palestinian ministers and parliamentarians. The statement said that Israel "needs to refrain from unilateral acts that could prejudice a final settlement and agree to negotiate in good faith," .

<h3>Summit leaders express differing opinions</h3>

Speaking to reporters, the assembled leaders did demonstrate some differences in their views on the conflict. 

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; said on Sunday that Hezbollah and its links with &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt; is a root cause of instability in the Middle East. &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="Tony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; said that extremists backed by &lt;a href="w%3ASyria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; wanted to interrupt the [peace] process. Tony Blair suggested that he was keen to travel to the Middle-East personally in discussions with George W. Bush, but George Bush suggested that &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ACondoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; should travel there instead.

Russian President &lt;a href="Vladimir%20Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; had earlier termed Israel's actions as excessive and on Saturday said that Israel was pursuing "other, wider goals". He also told reporters that Russia has specifically insisted on dropping any reference to Syria and Iran as Hezbollah supporters in the summit declaration.

&lt;a href="Germany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; Chancellor &lt;a href="Angela%20Merkel"&gt;Angela Merkel&lt;/a&gt; told reporters, "We demand first that the Israeli soldiers be returned to Israel healthy, that the attacks on Israel cease, and then naturally for Israel to halt military action."

While &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="w%3AJacques%20Chirac"&gt;Jacques Chirac&lt;/a&gt; said on Sunday that the G8 is calling for a ceasefire, the US Undersecretary of State for political affairs &lt;a href="w%3ANicholas%20Burns"&gt;Nicholas Burns&lt;/a&gt; disagreed and said that there was no push for one. Chirac had also expressed "extreme reservations about the disproportionate character of the Israeli reactions," but no such language was incorporated into the G8 statement.

<h3>Call for UN action</h3>
The summit declaration called on the UN &lt;a href="w%3ASecurity%20Council"&gt;Security Council&lt;/a&gt; to draw up plans for implementing its resolutions &lt;a href="w%3AUN%20Security%20Council%20Resolution%201559"&gt;UNSCR 1559&lt;/a&gt; and 1680, which call for extending the Lebanese government's authority over all of Lebanon and the disarming of militias such as Hezbollah. It also suggested that the Council should look at setting up a monitoring force in Lebanon.

The United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan said that Security Council members would follow up on the declaration and that starting Monday, work out a detailed plan for deploying a multilateral security force in Lebanon.

<h3>Reactions from the Middle-east</h3>
Israel later welcomed the Summit statement, supporting its call for Hezbollah to free the Israeli soldiers and halt rocket fire into Israel. Israel's Foreign Minister, Tzipi Livni said that the international community has "placed the responsibility for the conflict on extremist elements," and that Israel "sees the path to a solution through the release of the abducted soldiers, a cessation of rocket fire on Israel, and full implementation of (U.N.) resolution 1559,". 

In initial reaction to the proposed deployment, Israeli government spokeswoman Miri Eisin said, "I don't think we're at that stage yet. We're at the stage where we want to be sure that Hezbollah is not deployed at our northern border,".

In an address to the nation, Lebanese Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AFouad%20Siniora"&gt;Fouad Siniora&lt;/a&gt; urged an immediate cease-fire and establishment of the government's sovereignty in all Lebanese territory with help from the UN. It requested humanitarian aid and called for international pressure on Israel to stop its attacks. Disclaiming prior knowledge or responsibility for Hezbollah's capture of Israeli soldiers, the Prime Minister termed Israel's actions as "collective punishment".

Iranian Supreme Leader &lt;a href="w%3AAyatollah%20Khamenei"&gt;Ayatollah Khamenei&lt;/a&gt; said yesterday that Hezbollah would not disarm, despite calls from the US and "Zionists" (Israel). Iran says it offers moral but not military support to the Hezbollah and has denied Israeli accusations that Iranian arms have been used in the latest conflict.

Syria spoke of a "harsh and direct" response to any attack by Israel. Syrian President &lt;a href="w%3ABashar%20al-Assad"&gt;Bashar al-Assad&lt;/a&gt; said on Saturday that Syria will put its resources at the disposal of Lebanon to help cope with Israeli attacks devastating the country.

<h2>WTO Trade talks</h2>
The leaders of &lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; and the World Trade Organisation chief Pascal Lamy were also present at the final session of their three-day summit. 

They joined the G8 leaders in addressing the stalled negotiations in the &lt;a href="w%3ADoha%20round"&gt;Doha round&lt;/a&gt; of the WTO trade negotiations. The talks were deadlocked over US cuts on farm subsidies, the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;EU&lt;/a&gt; cuts on tariffs on farm goods and developing countries opening their markets for industrial goods and services.

Timely progress in the talks is crucial as the US president's special authority to negotiate trade deals will expire in a year. 

G8 powers have asked their trade negotiators and Pascal Lamy to broker a breakthrough on the stalled talks, giving WTO members one month to revive the Doha round.

A statement released said that the G8 was "fully committed to the development dimension of ongoing WTO talks." and that "The Doha Round should deliver real cuts in tariffs, effective cuts in subsidies and real new trade flows,". 

"In agriculture we are committed to substantially reducing trade-distorting domestic support and to the parallel elimination by the end of 2013 of all forms of export subsidies a well as establishment of effective disciplines on all export measures with equivalent effect as agreed in Hong Kong, the statement said.

The G8 also expressed support for Russia's entry into WTO in accordance with the rules that apply to all its members.

<h2>Assistance to Africa and other issues</h2>
While assistance to &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; was top of the agenda at last year's summit, this year it figured in the final session attended by Kofi Annan and the &lt;a href="w%3AAfrican%20Union"&gt;African Union&lt;/a&gt; delegation. Mr. Annan cited progress in implementing last years plans, but said much more needs to be done. 

"Fourteen African countries have been given complete debt relief, eight more have had substantial debt relief. We've seen some progress in development assistance. For the first time in many years we have gone over 100 billion dollars," he said.

The formal agenda of the meeting included securing energy supplies, boosting world trade talks and addressing a standoff over Iran's nuclear ambitions. Summit leaders approved documents on education and fighting infectious diseases, discussed high world oil prices and the state of democracy in Russia and renewed a pledge to combat the AIDS crisis, though no detailed funding plan for it was agreed upon. 

Bush also met with Chinese President &lt;a href="w%3AHu%20Jintao"&gt;Hu Jintao&lt;/a&gt; and discussed the standoff over nuclear power in Iran and nuclear weapons in North Korea.

A statement was also released reiterating the leaders' condemnation of terrorism and resolve to combat it. The leaders expressed outrage at the recent &lt;a href="w%3A11%20July%202006%20Mumbai%20train%20bombings"&gt;bomb blasts&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AMumbai"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/a&gt;, India which killed close to 200 people.

&lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; says that it stands firm on its position to strike &lt;a href="Hezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Hamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt; targets in &lt;a href="Lebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; until its two kidnapped soldiers have been released from captivity. In a speech to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKnesset"&gt;Knesset&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Israeli PM &lt;a href="Ehud%20Olmert"&gt;Ehud Olmert&lt;/a&gt; said the country wouldn't stop its attacks until they've succeeded in "bringing home the soldiers, complete peace and quiet, removing Hezbollah from the area".

The death toll in Lebanon after six days of Israeli strikes is now over 204 people, all but 14 of whom are civilians. A further 415 have been injured. Ten people were killed while their vehicle was crossing a bridge in southern Lebanon and at least 32 more died elsewhere in the country on Monday. 

Nine people, including six children, have been found dead in a house in the Lebanese town of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATyre"&gt;Tyre&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . They had reportedly taken shelter from Israeli air raids on Sunday when their house were hit. 

"What Israel has been doing is cutting the country to pieces", Lebanese PM &lt;a href="Fouad%20Siniora"&gt;Fouad Siniora&lt;/a&gt; said Monday. He also noted that the Israeli attacks had caused billions of dollars of damage for the country.

Israel attacked targets in &lt;a href="Beirut"&gt;Beirut&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Tripoli%2C%20Lebanon"&gt;Tripoli&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAbdeh"&gt;Abdeh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on Monday. In the Lebanese capital Beirut, the port and its southern suburbs were bombed. Fuel and gas storage tanks were also set ablaze. A private house was hit by a missile in southern Lebanon when it missed a Hezbollah site. Eight Lebanese soldiers were killed and twelve wounded when Israeli warplanes hit Abdeh in northern Lebanon.

Meanwhile, three Israeli tanks briefly entered Lebanon, reportedly to destroy Hezbollah encampments. The Israeli army denied it was part of a large-scale invasion. The Israeli Defense Minister said earlier that the country intended to create a one-kilometer "buffer zone" inside Lebanon to try to stop missiles fired by Hezbollah.

It was claimed that an Israeli F16 fighter jet was shot down over Beirut on Monday, and there were rumours that a pilot had been captured. Lebanese television showed a flaming object falling from the sky, but Israel said it had not lost any of its planes. Later, Israeli radio speculated that Hezbollah had attempted to launch a long-range missile that malfunctioned.

Hezbollah again fired missiles at the city of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHaifa"&gt;Haifa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and other towns in northern Israel Monday. Four people were injured in Haifa when a building partially collapsed, and six more were injured when a missile landed near a hospital in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASafed"&gt;Safed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The Israeli air force said it destroyed a truck sitting near the Israel-Lebanon border capable of firing long-range Iranian missiles. &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; denies selling missiles to the Hezbollah.

Several countries have been evacuating their citizens from Lebanon, and &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; PM &lt;a href="Dominique%20de%20Villepin"&gt;Dominique de Villepin&lt;/a&gt; is in Beirut where he held talks with his Lebanese counterpart.

For 30 minutes, a mob of heavily-armed gunmen tore through a Shiite populated market town in Mahmoudiya, Iraq, exploding car bombs and shooting at people.

Police Capt. Rashid al-Samaraie said the assault which killed at least 60 began at 9 a.m. when mortars were fired into the town and a group of men in cars stormed a checkpoint, killing three Iraqi soldiers.

The gunmen proceeded to attack shoppers and passers-by with automatic weapons and rocket propelled grenades. Some of the 50 strong attack force threw grenades into open restaurants and cafes. Two car bombs also were detonated leading to further casualties.

Local town official Sheik Bassem Anizi said he was an eyewitness to the events as they unfolded. "I saw the armed gunmen shooting randomly at the people. The terrorists wanted to send a message saying we can attack anywhere we want and kill civilians," he said. Anizi escaped the massacre by hiding behind a wall in a hardware shop.

Early reports said a total of 60 people died and about 50 people were injured. 
<h2>Reaction</h2>

On hearing the news Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr removed himself from a session in Parliament along with a similar protest made by another party.

"There is collaboration by the government and there is a conspiracy by the Americans and the Sunnis to kill the Shiites," said a statement released by al-Sadr's office.
"At the time of the shooting, all the Sunni shops were closed," it said, implying a link between Sunnis and the attacks. Al-Sadr also has been accused of ordering attacks which have killed Sunnis.

In the Iraqi Parliament Sunnis suggested the massacre might have been a reply to the kidnap and killing of seven Sunnis whose remains were left in Mahmoudiya, Sunday July 16.

The US military has said Iraqi troops have arrested two and have found a cache of arms believed to be connected to the bloody attack.

In the latest Newspoll to be released by "The Australian" newspaper Australian Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; has been favoured by the majority of those polled in the leadership tension with Deputy PM &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Costello"&gt;Peter Costello&lt;/a&gt;. Mr Howard polled 66% support (up 4% from April) compared to Mr Costello with 20% (Down 4% from April). Coalition voters polled stronger support for Howard than non-coalitoin voters (88% for Mr Howard to 10% to Mr Costello). Mr Howard leads the opposition leader &lt;a href="w%3AKim%20Beazley"&gt;Kim Beazley&lt;/a&gt; 53% to 27%- down from 56% to 25% in April. Nevertheless the Labor Party, led by Mr Beazley, was ahead of the Coalition 52% to 48% on a two party preferred basis indicating a that Labor may win an election should Mr Howard choose to step down as PM as Mr Beazley retains a 44% to 33% lead over the Deputy PM in the poll. 

In the same poll, 35% of those surveyed believed Mr Howard's version of the alleged "Leadership deal" meeting, and 65% believe Mr Costello.

Space shuttle &lt;a href="w%3ADiscovery"&gt;Discovery&lt;/a&gt; landed at &lt;a href="w%3ACape%20Canaveral"&gt;Cape Canaveral&lt;/a&gt; at 9:14 a.m. (1314 UTC) yesterday. It returned after a thirteen day mission to the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Space%20Station"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt; (ISS). 

The &lt;a href="w%3ASTS-121"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt; was used to provide thousands of pounds of supplies to the ISS and brought thousands of pounds of trash and discarded equipment back to Earth.

The shuttle, which was orbiting the Earth with the engine facing forward, fired the engines briefly to slow down and begin the descent, flipping its nose forward to prepare for the landing.

As Discovery descended into the atmosphere, parts of the shuttle's outer surfaces were heated to temperatures of about 3000°F (1650°C). 
The shuttle executed a series of computer controlled ♡❤S curves♡❤ to slow down to the landing speed.

The shuttle neared the landing strip at an angle 7 times steeper and a speed 20 times faster than a commercial aircraft.

The space shuttle was welcomed by hoots and whistles from the few hundred astronauts' relatives and space center workers as it landed on the 3 mile (4.8 kilometre) long runway

"It was a fun entry — it was beautiful," radioed mission commander &lt;a href="w%3ASteven%20W.%20Lindsey"&gt;Colonel Lindsey&lt;/a&gt; as he prepared to leave the shuttle.

"Just because we’re going to be back to flight doesn't mean we're going to change the way we're operating," he said. "We're going to be very careful, very cautious, look at everything — and we'll leave no stone unturned as we continue with this program."

This is the second space shuttle flight since the &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Columbia%20disaster"&gt;Columbia disaster&lt;/a&gt;.

A further 16 shuttle missions are scheduled for completing the space station before the fleet is retired in 2010.

“This shows that with appropriate care and vigilance, the odds of operating the shuttle with acceptable risk are good,” said John M. Logsdon, the director of the space policy institute at George Washington University.

“It doesn’t mean the shuttle is safe,” he added. “The shuttle will remain a very risky vehicle, to be operated with extreme care.”

<h1>Light aircraft makes emergency landing in major industrial estate</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Light%20aircraft%20makes%20emergency%20landing%20in%20major%20industrial%20estate&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

BBC Wales and iPTV station VTV are reporting that a light aircraft made an emergency landing at 13:00 BST at &lt;a href="w%3ATreforest"&gt;Treforest&lt;/a&gt; Industrial Estate near &lt;a href="w%3ACardiff"&gt;Cardiff&lt;/a&gt;.

The aircraft, an orange-coloured single-engine model Fox home-built kit was carrying two people when it made a forced landing on a section of dual carriageway within the industrial estate.

It is not known how severely the man and woman on board were injured, a spokesperson for South Wales Police stated that both of the aircraft's occupants sustained "non life-threatening injuries".

Treforest Industrial Estate is one of the largest business parks in the south Wales valleys. Its location, just two hundred metres from the main &lt;a href="w%3AA470%20road"&gt;A470 expressway&lt;/a&gt; could have resulted in a far greater tragedy.

VTV reporter and private pilot Craig Handley said that the location of the accident "would have been the most logical place to try and set the aircraft down as the dual carriageway, which runs through the estate, is clearly visible from the air and is almost completely straight and wide."

Today's accident comes less than a year after a similar-sized aircraft was forced to make an emergency landing less than two miles away from Treforest Industrial Estate. A Cessna 150 suffered a sudden loss of engine power during its approach to nearby Cardiff International Airport.

The Cessna in the earlier accident collided with a group of trees shedding its wings before coming to rest on a small country road. The two occupants of that aircraft received slight injuries.

South Wales Police have not confirmed whether any motorists or pedestrians were injured when the aircraft in today's accident made its emergency landing. The aircraft did cause some structural damage to a factory unit on the industrial estate prior to coming to rest, inverted, on the adjacent dual carriageway.

According to one eyewitness, the aircraft appeared to have experienced an engine-related problem seconds before impact.

A spokesperson, for Cardiff International Airport said that the aircraft had departed from Cardiff at 12:43 BST and that the airport's Air Traffic Control centre had lost contact with the plane.

The Civil Aviation Authority's Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB) have been informed and are due to begin their investigation into the crash.

One week has passed since &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; responded to a &lt;a href="w%3AHezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt; attack along the Lebanon-Israel border. There is no immediate end of the conflict in sight as Israeli airborne, naval and ground units have pounded a wide array of targets in &lt;a href="w%3ALebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;. Hezbollah in turn has launched rocket and missile attacks on northern Israel. 

The Lebanese PM &lt;a href="w%3AFouad%20Siniora"&gt;Fouad Siniora&lt;/a&gt; condemned Israel saying their attacks have been "opening the gates of hell and madness". He reiterated the Lebanese government position, urging Hezbollah to release Israeli soldiers, and calling on Israel to cease its attacks, terming them "disproportionate". However, an Israeli general said that the offensive could go on for weeks to come. 

Israeli PM Ehud Olmert claimed that last week's kidnappings were a timed attempt to divert attention from &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;'s nuclear programme. The Rapporteur of Iran's Majlis' National Security and Foreign Policy Commission Kazem Jalali dismissed the allegation, denying any such role. 

The civilian population in Lebanon has taken the largest toll in the conflict; 200 Lebanese civilians have been reported to be killed in the past seven days, 30 of them today. As a result of Hezbollah fire, at least 24 Israelis have been reported killed, including 9 civilians at the Haifa train station. In addition, 30 Lebanese soldiers have died without engaging Israeli units. Eleven of them were killed today in an Israeli air strike on a Lebanese army base east of Beirut. A Lebanese barracks was also hit yesterday, killing several soldiers.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; want an international peace contingent to be stationed in southern Lebanon to stop Hezbollah from firing missiles into Israel. The force would act as a stabilisation force against attacks from both sides in the conflict. 

500,000 people have been displaced in Lebanon by the violence which could end in a humanitarian disaster, UN said.

A UN team was in Israel today, holding talks with the Israeli FM about a possible ceasefire agreement. However, the minister reiterated Israel's ultimatum that its two soldiers should be released and the Lebanese government posts troops in southern Lebanon before agreeing on a ceasefire. Lebanon say they fear posting soldiers in it's southern region could spark a civil war in the country.

Hezbollah militants have also today fired rockets on towns in northern Israel. Haifa, Acre, Kiryat Shemona and the region of Gush Halav have been hit. One Israeli was killed. Hezbollah have made comparisons between the Israeli "enemy combatants" they are holding without trial, and the inmates of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AGuantanamo%20Bay%20detainment%20camp"&gt;Guantanamo Bay&lt;/a&gt; who they say have a similar status.

Today, transport trucks were again targeted by warplanes. Israel says it believed that the trucks were transporting missiles for Hezbollah. The Israeli military say 750 Hezbollah rockets, missiles and mortars have so far been fired since the start of the crisis.

Hundreds of foreigners have been evacuated from Lebanon by any available transportation. Ships, helicopters and buses have been used by several European countries and the United States to ferry their citizens out of the country.

Temperatures as high as 111°&lt;a href="w%3AFahrenheit"&gt;F&lt;/a&gt; (48°&lt;a href="w%3ACentigrade"&gt;C&lt;/a&gt;) have hit the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; today, a continuation of Monday's triple-digit (Fahrenheit) record highs in some areas.

High energy costs have many elderly and low income citizens keeping the air conditioning off, fixed incomes being blamed in many cases. In response to this, cities such as Chicago and New York have turned some public facilities into “cooling areas” for the duration. Buildings being converted include homeless shelters, senior centers, libraries and shopping malls. State agencies are urging anyone experiencing heat related symptoms to get to one of these places as soon as possible. 

Early reports are attributing at least three dead from heat related complications in &lt;a href="w%3APhiladelphia"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AArkansas"&gt;Arkansas&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AIndiana"&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt;

The &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Weather%20Service"&gt;National Weather Service&lt;/a&gt; has issued Red Flag warnings for six states, warning that the heat could easily lead to forest fires. Much of the northeast corridor and central plains states have been issued heat warnings. 

Relief is in sight for the northeast, with storms bringing cooler weather from the Ohio Valley through New England; however the central part of the US won't see a break in the heat until the weekend.

In the continued conflict between Hezbollah and &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;, six &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadians&lt;/a&gt;, including four children who were killed on Sunday by an Israeli missile hitting a house in south &lt;a href="Lebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; have been identified. 

Saja Al-Akhrass (8), Zeinab Al-Akhrass (6), Ahmad Al-Akhrass (4), and Salam Al-Akhrass (11 months) were in Lebanon for a summer holiday, visiting their extended family. They were killed when their house collapsed after being struck by an Israeli bombardment. Their parents, 36-year-old Ali Al-Akhrass and his wife Amira (23) were also killed in the attack. The family were residents of &lt;a href="w%3AMontreal"&gt;Montreal&lt;/a&gt;.

Six others were reported wounded in the attack. 

"I lost my brother, I lost my sister, my nephew, the family of my nephew, my aunt, my uncle. Oh God," said Hussain El-Akras, brother of one of the victims. He told a Montreal news conference Monday that his family were begging the government of Canada to "put pressure on Israel to stop this barbaric behaviour." 

The &lt;a href="w%3AIsraeli%20Defense%20Forces"&gt;Israeli military&lt;/a&gt; statement on the incident said "The responsibility for any civilian casualties rests entirely with the Hezbollah terrorist organization" and "The IDF (Israel Defense Forces) requested and warned residents of the area not to stay within range of the launch sites". Israel says that Hezbollah disperses its weaponry among supporters in residential neighborhoods to avoid being targeted by the much larger, better-equipped Israeli Defense Forces.

As &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; had previously announced, they will stop supporting the first service pack of their flagship operating system software, &lt;a href="w%3AWindows%20XP"&gt;Windows XP&lt;/a&gt;. The company will not provide any security updates or incident support options for Windows XP Service Pack 1 (SP1) and Service Pack 1a (SP1a).

On October 10, 2006 support and security updates for these two products will end, as part of the Microsoft Lifecycle Policy. In their customer notification about the change, the software giant advises customers to update to the newer Service Pack 2 (SP2), released in 2004.

Windows XP SP1 was released on September 9, 2002, offering more than 300 security updates in one package. Other than the security updates, SP1 also introduced &lt;a href="w%3AUniversal%20Serial%20Bus"&gt;USB 2.0&lt;/a&gt; support and a new utility, ♡❤Set Program Access and Defaults♡❤, which let users to have control over Microsoft's bundled products. On February 3, 2003, the service pack was re-released as Service Pack 1a which, as a result of a lawsuit with &lt;a href="w%3ASun%20Microsystems"&gt;Sun Microsystems&lt;/a&gt;, removed the Microsoft virtual machine (VM), which provided support for &lt;a href="w%3AJava%20programming%20language"&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt; programs.

The support end date for SP1 was originally September 17, 2006.

<h1>Stem cell bills passed by US House and Senate</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Stem%20cell%20bills%20passed%20by%20US%20House%20and%20Senate&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2005 (HR810), approved by the US House of Representatives in 2005, gained a 63-37 approval in the Senate on July 17th, 2006, and will now be presented for presidential approval or veto. 

Bill HR810 passed by the Senate as SB471, overrides the 2001 executive order signed by &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; that banned funding by the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Institutes%20of%20Health"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt; (NIH) for embryonic stem cell research of stem cell lines created after the executive order was issued. The new bill does not include a provision against privately funded research, which is legal under the law, only research funded by NIH. 

The bill includes three ethical requirements for funded research. First, the stem cells were derived from human embryos that have been donated from in-vitro fertilization clinics, were created for the purposes of fertility treatment, and were in excess of the clinical need of the individuals seeking such treatment. Second, prior to the consideration of embryo donation and through consultation with the individuals seeking fertility treatment, it was determined that the embryos would never be implanted in a woman and would otherwise be discarded. And lastly, the individuals seeking fertility treatment donated the embryos with written informed consent and without receiving any financial or other inducements to make the donation.

President Bush is expected to veto the bill as early as today, White House Press Secretary Tony Snow said the veto would be "pretty swift". This would be President Bush's first veto of his two terms in office. 

As with any vetoed bill, a two-thirds majority of the House and Senate can override said veto, but the original vote (63-37) show that the Senate is more than likely to not get the override votes it would need. Even without the two-thirds original vote, Senator Carl Levin of Michigan has voiced support for a veto override.

Two other bills, S2754 and S3504, the Alternative Pluripotent Stem Cell Therapies Enhancement Act and the Fetus Farming Prohibition Act of 2006, respectively, were failed and passed in that order by the House of Representatives. S2754 was introduced to the House this afternoon and failed by a vote of 273-154, S3504 was passed unanimously by the House and is also expected to be on the President's desk this morning.

According to a leaked &lt;a href="w%3Amemorandum"&gt;memorandum&lt;/a&gt;, sent to &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Police"&gt;New Zealand Police&lt;/a&gt; officers in the &lt;a href="w%3ALevin%2C%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Levin&lt;/a&gt; district last year, they will be penalised if they do not perform well in the issuing tickets.

The penalties for not reaching the target will be:
<ul>
BULLET::::- Pay deductions, 20% loss of pay
BULLET::::- Loss of additional training courses or specialised duties
BULLET::::- 'Named and shamed'
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="w%3ADemotion"&gt;Demotion&lt;/a&gt;

</ul>
The requirement for issuing tickets is one per hour and the requirement for catching a &lt;a href="w%3Adrunk%20driver"&gt;drunk driver&lt;/a&gt; is one per ten hours.

&lt;a href="w%3ASimon%20Power"&gt;Simon Power&lt;/a&gt;, Law and Order spokesman for the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20National%20Party"&gt;New Zealand National Party&lt;/a&gt;, said "It is very disturbing that police officers are being put under internal and financial pressure to write traffic tickets. And just yesterday &lt;a href="w%3AAnnette%20King"&gt;Annette King&lt;/a&gt; told me in answer to a written question that police do not receive incentives, financial or otherwise, if they issue a particular number of tickets."

Two weeks ago a different memo was leaked which showed the police officers have quotas, which the Police Minister, Annette King, dismissed.

However if police officers are performing well the Area or District Commanders will be informed which could lead to extra benefits.

The Police Central District Commander, Superintendent Mark Lammas, said that there was nothing wrong with the memo as it is reasonable for officers to be told they may not receive a pay increase if they consistently fail to enforce.

An earthquake measuring 6.3 or 6.4 (according to preliminary data) on the Richter scale hit &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; today, days after a larger earthquake hit the same region and triggered a tsunami and killed at least 520 people. The earthquake struck the &lt;a href="w%3ASunda%20Straits"&gt;Sunda Straits&lt;/a&gt; separating the islands of &lt;a href="w%3ASumatra"&gt;Sumatra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJava"&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt;. There are no immediate reports of damages. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said that the quake posed no risk of a tsunami, being too small in magnitude. 

The US Geological Survey has reported the magnitude of the quake as 6.0.

Today has seen Britain's hottest recorded July day with temperatures hitting 36.5ºC (97.7ºF) in &lt;a href="w%3AWisley"&gt;Wisley&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASurrey"&gt;Surrey&lt;/a&gt;. Warm air from the &lt;a href="w%3AGulf%20Stream"&gt;Gulf Stream&lt;/a&gt; is raising the temperature, and the hot weather is causing the &lt;a href="w%3Aasphalt"&gt;asphalt&lt;/a&gt; on some public roads to melt, requiring gritting. Some schools stayed closed on Wednesday, while others shut at lunchtime. Many school sports days have also been cancelled. 

People have been advised to drink plenty of water, not go out in the midday sun and keep curtains closed to cool rooms. People have also been asked to check the most vulnerable, including the elderly, the young and the sick. The &lt;a href="w%3ARSPCA"&gt;RSPCA&lt;/a&gt; has also told pet owners to try and keep their pets cool.

The heat wave has also hit northern &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ANetherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, with 4 people reported dead due to &lt;a href="w%3Aheatstroke"&gt;heatstroke&lt;/a&gt;.

However, some areas aren't basking in the heat. &lt;a href="w%3ALerwick"&gt;Lerwick&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AShetland%20Islands"&gt;Shetland Islands&lt;/a&gt; is currently cloudy with fog, at only 18ºC (64ºF)

Weather forecasters have said that while the temperatures are not going to rise any further, it will get more humid as a band of showers arrive this evening, with night-time temperatures at 19ºC in &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACardiff"&gt;Cardiff&lt;/a&gt;, 14ºC in &lt;a href="w%3AEdinburgh"&gt;Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt; and 18ºC in &lt;a href="w%3ADublin"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt;.

U.S. President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; has used the first &lt;a href="w%3Aveto"&gt;veto&lt;/a&gt; of his presidency on a bill for federal funding of scientific research which uses &lt;a href="w%3AEmbryonic%20stem%20cell"&gt;embryonic stem cells&lt;/a&gt;. The bill aimed to increase the number of stem cells lines in federally funded science. Despite the veto, the destruction of embryos to extract stem cells will still take place in scientific research; the research will simply not be funded by the federal government. It is illegal in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; to create (through conception) embryos for the purpose of scientific research.

The bill had passed in the Senate 63-37, four votes short of a 2/3 majority needed to override the President's veto. The bill will go back to the House and Senate.

Bush had previously announced that he would veto this bill.

Bush described it as a step that would cross a "moral line". "This bill would support the taking of innocent human life," Mr. Bush said at the &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; while surrounded by parents and children that were born as part of an embryo-adoption programme. "Each of these human embryos is a unique human life with inherent dignity and matchless value. These boys and girls are not spare parts."

&lt;a href="w%3ANancy%20Pelosi"&gt;Nancy Pelosi&lt;/a&gt;, House minority leader, said "the veto amounted to saying 'no' to hope. It is up to members of Congress to represent their constituents and vote to override the veto." 

Many high-profile organizations &amp;mdash; such as the &lt;a href="w%3AChristopher%20Reeve%20Foundation"&gt;Christopher Reeve Foundation&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20J.%20Fox"&gt;Michael J. Fox&lt;/a&gt; Foundation for &lt;a href="w%3AParkinson%27s%20disease"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt; Research &amp;mdash; were actively advocating the passage of the bill.

</ul>
The &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;U.S. House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; failed to override Bush's veto. The final vote was 235-193, which was 51 short of the 2/3 majority needed for a veto override.

A joint &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Poland"&gt;Polish&lt;/a&gt; police operation freed 113 Polish workers who were living in forced labor camps on a tomato farm in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMezzogiorno"&gt;southern Italy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Twenty people were arrested on charges of &lt;a href="human%20trafficking"&gt;human trafficking&lt;/a&gt;, and the police are on the look-out for seven more. 

The police said that the freed victims were made to work "like slaves". They were subject to rape and torture and had dogs set upon them by armed &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUkraine"&gt;Ukrainian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Italian and Polish guards who watched over them, said Poland's national police chief, Marek Bienkowski, speaking at a news conference in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWarsaw"&gt;Warsaw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The deaths of four victims in the camps are believed to be suicides and are being investigated. Police have not ruled out the possibility that more deaths have occurred in the camps.

The victims were forced to work for 15 hours a day and were fed little more than bread and water, Italian police said. "To call the situation revealed by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACarabinieri"&gt;Carabinieri&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; investigation simply inhuman does in no way do it justice," said Italy's anti-Mafia chief, Piero Grasso, speaking to reporters in the southern city of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABari"&gt;Bari&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

300 people who managed to flee the camps are being interviewed. Up to 1000 are believed to have been victims of this crime, according to the Polish news agency PAP. The workers were reportedly recruited through ads in Polish newspapers promising agricultural work in Italy.

Producers of &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ABig%20Brother"&gt;Big Brother&lt;/a&gt; have said that an upcoming celebrity edition will have a ban on "hanky-panky".

A spokeswoman for &lt;a href="w%3AEndemol"&gt;Endemol&lt;/a&gt; India told &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20News"&gt;BBC News&lt;/a&gt; that contestants will have to remain chaste in the Big Brother house for three months. "Participants will be told to keep their hands to themselves," she revealed. "India is a conservative society and it is not ready for the raunchy scenes that so characterise the programmes in the West," she added. 

And unlike other versions of Big Brother around the world, India's version will not be transmitted live in a bid to avoid showing unpleasant scenes which may cause controversy. 

It is understood that up to twelve contestants will participate in the show, which is to be televised at the end of this year. The show’s producers have said they want stars from &lt;a href="w%3ABollywood"&gt;Bollywood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20television"&gt;Indian television&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Acricket"&gt;cricket&lt;/a&gt; to live in the Big Brother compound. The managing director of Endemol India, Rajesh Kamat, said both &lt;a href="w%3AHindus"&gt;Hindus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMuslims"&gt;Muslims&lt;/a&gt; may be chosen, but that issues between religions would not be talked about on the programme. 

India is still quite a conservative society. Close acts like kissing are never seen on TV, and only a small number of couples cohabit before marriage.

In 2006, two housemates were removed from &lt;a href="w%3ABig%20Brother%20%28Australia%29"&gt;Australia's version of Big Brother&lt;/a&gt; after apparently sexually assaulting a female contestant. 

Big Brother was created in the &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; in 1999 and has sold to almost seventy different countries.

<h1>Nicole relives ordeal</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Nicole%20relives%20ordeal&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Prosecution witnesses, both security personnel, describe Nicole as visibly drunk at the Nepture Bar inside Subic Bay Freeport.

Tomas Corpuz Jr., security guard, describes Nicole as swaying "as if she wasn't herself" and barely able to stand. "When she happened to pass me by and almost bumped me, she reeked of liquor,” Corpuz said. This was, according to Corpuz, at about 11 pm November 1.

Gerald Muyot, who was posted outside the Neptune at around the same time, said that he saw an American (later identified as Smith) carrying a very drunk Nicole piggyback on his way out of the bar and “loading” her into a green Starex van with plate number WKF-162. Muyot testified that one of the Americans said: "She’s with me, we’re gonna go now.” 

“I became suspicious because he told me that when I wasn’t even asking him—and why would he say that to me? That’s why I took a piece of paper from my wallet and took note of the van’s plate number.”

Muyot said that at around 2:45 a.m. of Nov. 2, a mobile patrol car arrived in front of the Neptune. He said Nicole alighted and asked security guards if there were any other US servicemen inside the bar. 

“She said the men did something bad to her and she wanted to see if there were any other US Marines inside. So I escorted her inside the club, but when she saw that there were no other Marines there, she left,” Muyot said.

The defense tried to portray the Nepture Bar as a "naughty place," asking such questions as “What do people do in the private VIP rooms?” and if Neptune employed hospitality girls and if so how many were working that night.

Ursua, on the other hand, is using the testimonty of the two security guards as further evidence that Nicole could not have consented to sex since "she was very drunk, she smelled of liquor, she appeared to be not herself inside the bar,” adding that “when a woman is raped, her character would have nothing to do with it. Even one who’s into prostitution has a right not to be raped.”

Furthermore, on the took the defense lawyers’ questions about Neptune being a "naughty" and "notorious" place, Ursua said that "it has nothing to do with the issue of rape."

<h1>DNA in underwear matches Philippines rape victim</h1>

Dr. Francisco Supe Jr., a forensic analyst from the DNA Analysis Section of the Philippine National Police (PNP) Crime Laboratory, took the stand and disclosed in court for the first time that DNA was present in two pieces of evidence. According to Supe, DNA of complainant "Nicole" was found in samples of "biological fluid" found on the panties she was wearing on the night of Nov. 1, 2005 and in the condom purportedly used by accused Lance Corporal Daniel Smith in committing the alleged rape.

The used condom was retrieved at Subic's Alava Pier where a distraught Nicole was found after the alleged rape. 

"The condom and the underwear had female DNA, and they matched. They are the same DNA profiles ... which means they most likely belong to the same person," the expert witness said during direct examination by State Prosecutor Hazel Valdez.

Only Nicole's underwear tested positive for male DNA---a result that Supe attributed to the possible "degradation" of bodily fluids on the condom to "environmental insults, particularly the humid condition, bacterial factors that may have contaminated it ... and the enzyme inside DNA which destroys it when functioning outside a living system."

In reply to Valdez’s question, Supe said that while it was possible that the evidence had not been handled properly before the turnover, he said the condom and the panties were not contaminated as they still yielded DNA samples.

Upon Valdez's questioning, Supe related how analysts came to match the female DNA found in both specimens with that of the complainant.

He said Nicole's DNA, extracted from a blood sample that she had voluntarily provided, was the same as that found in the panties and the condom.

"I am comparing now, and it appears that they match exactly -- the DNA profiles generated from the blood sample and the samples generated from the condom and the underwear," said Supe, referring to two DNA test results he was holding.

Valdez then sought Supe's expertise on the possible indications of the presence of male DNA in a woman’s underwear, and asked him its possible source.

Supe replied: "We're dealing here with a [pair of panties] and you would think of areas that come in contact with a panty... The most probable source is either saliva or seminal stains. But if you go by logic, I don't see any reason why anybody would lick a panty." While the test may lead experts to areas where DNA can be extracted, it cannot specify which part of the body the spots came from, Supe had explained.

Supe said the owner of the male DNA could not be identified as yet, as the crime laboratory lacked a sample with which to compare the results. None of the accused----Smith, Lance Corporals Keith Silkwood and Dominic Duplantis, and Staff Sgt. Chad Carpentier---had submitted his specimen for DNA testing. The prosecution panel had filed a motion on July 17, asking the court to compel the accused to submit blood samples for comparison with the male DNA found in Nicole's panties. Defense lawyers told the court that they would file their reply on July 20.

In response to the question on how could a female's DNA be in a used condom, Supe replied: "The most plausible is that the inside of the condom came in contact with [Nicole]... Maybe that part of the condom was rubbed with [Nicole]," he said. "Most likely it came in contact with the genital area, [but it] was turned inside out most likely, such that the [DNA] specimen was preserved."

When asked to demonstrate how a condom could have been reversed, Supe had apparently anticipated the question and brought a condom. He then demonstrated how a condom could have been turned inside out in the act of removing it.

Defense lawyer Jose Justiniano said Supe's testimony did not help prove rape. He said the presence of the male and female DNA in the specimen could at most prove that a man and a woman had sex, not whether or not there was "a presence of force or intimidation,"

This case has garnered nationwide attention in Philippines because it involves US military men stationed in Philippines. As required by the Visiting Forces Agreement, the case has to be resolved within one year. 

Cross-examination of Supe is scheduled for Thursday, July 20.

Steven Lacey, 56, from &lt;a href="w%3ABrooten%2C%20Minnesota"&gt;Brooten, Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;, was killed in a one-vehicle &lt;a href="w%3Arollover"&gt;rollover&lt;/a&gt; late Sunday night, July 16, 2006.

The &lt;a href="w%3APope%20County%2C%20Minnesota"&gt;Pope County&lt;/a&gt; Sheriff’s Office said that at approximately 11 p.m. his vehicle went off the road and rolled over on 110th Avenue, near Brooten, Minnesota, in Pope County, Minnesota's Bangor Township, about 15 miles SE from Glenwood, MN, about 55 miles WNW from St. Cloud, MN, or about 100 miles NW from the Twin Cities.

The victim was reportedly killed on impact when his 1995 Chevy pickup rolled over after leaving the road.

The Pope County Sheriff's department reports that Lacey was not wearing his seatbelt at the time of the accident.

&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20One%3A%20Making%20a%20Music%20Star"&gt;♡❤The One: Making a Music Star♡❤&lt;/a&gt; is a new reality show hosted by &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation"&gt;CBC&lt;/a&gt; personality &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Stroumboulopoulos"&gt;George Stroumboulopoulos&lt;/a&gt;.

The show airs on &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Broadcasting%20Company"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt; and on &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation"&gt;CBC&lt;/a&gt;.

It premiered yesterday and has sparked some controversy over the &lt;a href="w%3Asimulcast"&gt;simulcast&lt;/a&gt;, which according to ABC's schedule means displacing CBC's &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20National"&gt;♡❤The National♡❤&lt;/a&gt; for a U.S. program.

Over the past few weeks, CBC's decision to simulcast The One has drawn criticism from a number of individuals and groups, including &lt;a href="w%3AFriends%20of%20Canadian%20Broadcasting"&gt;Friends of Canadian Broadcasting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;NDP&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3A39th%20Canadian%20Parliament"&gt;MP&lt;/a&gt; and federal heritage critic &lt;a href="w%3ACharlie%20Angus"&gt;Charlie Angus&lt;/a&gt;, and a retired CBC journalist &lt;a href="w%3AKnowlton%20Nash"&gt;Knowlton Nash&lt;/a&gt;.
Since the show airs on Tuesday night, the episodes will bump ♡❤The National♡❤ to an earlier slot in &lt;a href="w%3AAtlantic%20Canada"&gt;Atlantic Canada&lt;/a&gt; and a later one in &lt;a href="w%3AOntario"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AQuebec"&gt;Québec&lt;/a&gt;, which means it will air at 11:00 PM instead of 10:00 PM in Ontario and in Quebec. The Wednesday night editions will also bump ♡❤The National♡❤ to an earlier slot in Ontario and Quebec.

A Canadian version of the series will launch in the fall in another time slot, but a condition of the CBC's franchise deal for this production was to simulcast the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Broadcasting%20Company"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt; production. This also represents the first time in over a decade that the CBC has scheduled an American-produced series in &lt;a href="w%3Aprime%20time"&gt;prime time&lt;/a&gt;.

The CBC's will continue to show ♡❤The National♡❤ at different times on the main broadcast network and on CBC Newsworld. "We get discouraged that people don't appreciate the fact that [♡❤The National♡❤] is on Newsworld. . . . People watch their news on the Internet, on cable, on broadcast and we're giving it to them in all different kinds of ways. We're very proud of ♡❤The National♡❤. I just hope that gets across." , said Kirstine Layfield, CBC's executive director of network programming.

Officials in &lt;a href="w%3AManila"&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt; have issued evacuation orders for a 6km (4mi) radius around &lt;a href="w%3AMount%20Mayon"&gt;Mayon Volcano&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3APhilippines"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt; as ash clouds, rivulets of lava, and sulphur dioxide levels indicate an imminent explosive eruption.

Many residents, though, are hesitant to leave. Regional disaster coordinating council official Angel Capilli has said that the people who farm the rich soil near the volcano would be "forcibly" removed from the area should vulcanologists determine an explosive eruption is imminent.

Mount Mayon has erupted 47 times in recorded history, with the last major eruption in 2001 shooting ash nearly 10km above the volcano

The &lt;a href="w%3AUK"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; Environment Secretary, &lt;a href="David%20Miliband"&gt;David Miliband&lt;/a&gt; proposed a &lt;a href="w%3Acarbon%20trading"&gt;carbon trading&lt;/a&gt; scheme for private citizens during the &lt;a href="w%3AAudit_Commission"&gt;Audit Commission&lt;/a&gt;'s annual lecture.

Under the scheme all individuals will receive equal carbon points and can trade electricity, gas, petrol and air travel for carbon points.

Mr. Miliband argues that the government could set limits on the amount of carbon emitted. He says that people with low income who contribute less to carbon emission could benefit by selling off excess carbon points. He also says that the scheme is more empowering than other forms of regulations such as banning particular products, services or activities, or taxing them heavily.

Chris Huhne, the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Democrats"&gt;Liberal Democrat&lt;/a&gt;s' environment spokesman, “supported any discussion about household carbon allowances”. but also argues that that this would take too long to implement. He said that green taxes have fallen to their lowest since Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minster.

An &lt;a href="w%3AAuckland"&gt;Auckland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; policewoman, who has not been named, has been working part-time as a &lt;a href="w%3Aprostitute"&gt;prostitute&lt;/a&gt;. Her employer, Auckland City Police, did not know that she had been working as a prostitute for a limited time. She has been able to keep her police job.

&lt;a href="w%3AProstitution%20in%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Prostitution became legal in New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; in 2003.

The police officer was prostituting herself because of financial difficulties. A person working in the &lt;a href="w%3AChristchurch"&gt;Christchurch&lt;/a&gt; sex industry said "It's usually either for debts or drugs."

She is now undergoing counselling.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Police"&gt;New Zealand Police&lt;/a&gt; would not comment on how long she had been acting as a prostitute.

Lyn Provost, Deputy Commissioner, said "the nature of the secondary employment was incompatible with policing and would never have been approved."

The police say that if a police officer was to seek secondary employment then it must be signed off, this job hadn't been. It would have been a conflict of interest.

&lt;a href="w%3ARon%20Mark"&gt;Ron Mark&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20First%20Party"&gt;New Zealand First Party&lt;/a&gt; Law and Order spokesman, said "the case is concerning, because while prostitution is legal, it is associated with criminal activity."

A representative of the New Zealand Prostitutes' Collective (NZPC) said there were law students and doctors who were sex workers.

"NZPC's philosophy is that we support people that are in that secondary employment ... we support them for their sexual health needs or any other needs – emotionally, physically, spiritually – that we can accommodate." a representative of the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Prostitutes%27%20Collective"&gt;New Zealand Prostitutes' Collective&lt;/a&gt; said.

International &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHumanitarianism"&gt;humanitarian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; organisations and &lt;a href="human%20rights"&gt;human rights&lt;/a&gt; watchdogs have expressed concerns over the rising civilian casualties and the humanitarian crisis caused by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Israel-Lebanon%20crisis"&gt;ongoing conflict&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;a href="Lebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; and northern &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;. They have also warned the warring groups that their conduct may not comply with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20humanitarian%20law"&gt;international laws&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; governing the safety of civilians in combat areas. 

<h2>UNCHR statement</h2>
The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20High%20Commissioner%20for%20Human%20Rights"&gt;United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALouise%20Arbour"&gt;Louise Arbour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; expressed grave concern over the growing civilian casualties in the conflict in &lt;a href="Lebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIsraeli-occupied%20territories"&gt;occupied Palestinian territory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and called for accountability for any breaches of international law in a statement released on Wednesday.

The statement said that indiscriminate shelling of cities and the targeting of supposed military sites which would possibly result in civilians deaths is unacceptable and unjustifiable. It called for respecting the principle of proportionality in reacting to enemy action. 

The statement reminded parties to the conflict that the obligation to protect civilians during hostilities is expressed in international criminal law, and warned that the scale and predictability of the killings in the region may attach personal criminal responsibility of those involved, especially those in positions of command and control.

The High Commissioner also warned of the deteriorating humanitarian situation, especially in southern Lebanon, where large numbers of people are 
reported to be increasingly deprived of access to basic services and are forcibly displaced. She called for unrestricted and secure passage for all humanitarian assistance.

<h2>Red Cross' assessment</h2>

In a press briefing in Geneva, The &lt;a href="International%20Committee%20of%20the%20Red%20Cross"&gt;International Committee of the Red Cross&lt;/a&gt; (ICRC) 
director of operations Pierre Krähenbühl gave the ICRC's assessment of the humanitarian situation engendered by the conflict. 

He said that the large number of civilian casualties and damage to infrastructure "raises serious questions" over the warring parties' compliance to the principle of proportionality in combat operations.

In the briefing, he stated the reported death toll as about 230 killed and 600 wounded in Lebanon and 13 civilians killed and over 150 wounded in Israel.

He said that medical assistance and evacuation for those in need is severely limited by the ongoing hostilities and that the safety of the medical mission is "deeply problematic". He pointed out that large numbers of people are fleeing the conflict zones.

He called on Israel's air and sea blockade of Lebanon to allow food and other essential supplies to reach the affected civilian population.

He stated that the ICRC has reminded the parties to the conflict, publicly and in private, of their obligation to distinguish between civilians and military targets, their obligation to respect the principle of proportionality, and to protect the medical aid services, to spare civilians and ensure secure access to medical help for all.

The representations have been made in Israel with the Ministry of foreign affairs and Army command, and in Lebanon with the Prime minister and also to &lt;a href="Hezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt;, with whom the ICRC has contact.

<h2>Human Rights Watch</h2>

The watchdog group &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHuman%20Rights%20Watch"&gt;Human Rights Watch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; warned &lt;a href="Hezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt; on attacking civilian targets in Israel and called on Israel to allow relief convoys safe entry into and passage inside Lebanon, 

A press release by the group said that Hezbollah rocket attacks on Sunday and Monday were "at best indiscriminate attacks in civilian areas, at worst the deliberate targeting of civilians" and called them serious violations of international humanitarian law and "probable war crimes". The rockets launched against &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHaifa"&gt;Haifa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; over the past two days contained hundreds of metal ball bearings that are of limited use against military targets but cause great harm to civilians and civilian property, it said.

A release also said that border towns in Lebanon are already facing serious shortages of food and medicine, and are in urgent need of supplies. It called for safe passage for aid convoys in the wake on an Israeli missile attack on an aid convoy, reported by the &lt;a href="Red%20Crescent%20Society"&gt;Red Crescent Society&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="United%20Arab%20Emirates"&gt;United Arab Emirates&lt;/a&gt; (UAE). According to the UAE RC, the convoy was clearly marked as a relief operation, contained medical supplies and medicines, as well as several ambulances and that at least one person was killed in the attack.

<h2>Amnesty International</h2>

&lt;a href="Amnesty%20International"&gt;Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt; (AI) today called on the UN &lt;a href="UN%20Security%20Council"&gt;Security Council&lt;/a&gt; to meet urgently in order to adopt measures to protect civilians caught up in the deepening Israel-Lebanon conflict. It alleged that &lt;a href="G8"&gt;G8&lt;/a&gt; member states, during the recently concluded summit, had failed to "put the protection of civilians above politics" in their discussions of the conflict. AI condemned continuing attacks on civilians by both Israel and Hezbollah.

<h2>Responses from Israel and Hezbollah</h2>
An Israeli official told the BBC "We feel that proportionality should be judged in terms of the threat we face. This is not just an issue of the kidnappings. Hezbollah has a huge arsenal and has fired 1,000 missiles at us. We are acting in self-defence". He also said that Hezbollah often hides in civilian areas and that Israel had dropped fliers and gave other warnings to civilians to leave before an attack.

Also, Vice Premier Shimon Peres questioned the reported casualty count in Lebanon, saying in an interview with CNN, "the numbers of the victims [in Lebanon] are not acceptable. We think that information coming from Lebanon is totally unreliable." 

Hezbollah says its capture of Israeli soldiers was to use them in a "bargain" with Israel and that Hezbollah rocket attacks on Israel are a retaliation to Israeli strikes against Lebanon and its civilians. Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah leader, said "When the Zionists behave like there are no rules and no red lines and no limits to the confrontation, it is our right to behave in the same way."

Investigations are continuing at &lt;a href="w%3AAlton%20Towers"&gt;Alton Towers&lt;/a&gt; after a total of 29 people were injured on a roller-coaster. 

Six people were taken to hospital after the accident at the &lt;a href="w%3AUK"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;’s most famous theme park. The front carriages of the &lt;a href="w%3ARunaway_Mine_Train_%2528Alton_Towers%2529"&gt;Runaway Mine Train&lt;/a&gt;, which had 46 passengers on it at the time, became separated and subsequently crashed back into the rest of the ride at the &lt;a href="w%3AStaffordshire"&gt;Staffordshire&lt;/a&gt; theme park. 

A Staffordshire Ambulance spokesman said two women, aged in their 30s or 40s, were flown by air ambulance to North Staffordshire Hospital suffering possible whiplash, spinal or abdominal injuries. A third woman was taken by land ambulance to the same hospital and a man is thought to have made his own way to a casualties centre in &lt;a href="w%3ALeek%2C%20Staffordshire"&gt;Leek&lt;/a&gt;. Two other people were taken to Accident and Emergency later, and the other people who were injured were treated for cuts and bruises on the premises. 

The ride, which opened in 1990 and is one of Alton Towers oldest attractions, was immediately evacuated and closed to the public. Alton Towers and the &lt;a href="w%3AHealth%20and%20Safety%20Executive"&gt;Health and Safety Executive&lt;/a&gt; are investigating the incident which occurred at 11:00am local time on Thursday. 

A spokeswoman for the theme park announced that “the ride has been closed and will remain so whilst a thorough investigation is carried out”. It is unclear how long the ride will be closed for, but the rest of the theme park will stay open.

On the Alton Towers website, customers are told the Runaway Mine Train lets them “rattle along the rickety rails and mine shafts, past trees and rivers, on a speeding locomotive that’s out of control - and getting faster every second” .

The roller coaster was manufactured by Mack Rides, and is situated in the Katanga Canyon area of the theme park. The train normally makes two circuits for each ride, but on quiet days, it has been known to make three.

Tensions are escalating rapidly on the &lt;a href="w%3A%20Horn_of_Africa"&gt;horn of Africa&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;a href="w%3AIslamic%20Courts%20of%20Somalia"&gt;United Islamic Courts&lt;/a&gt; (UIC) closed in on Baidoa, the home of &lt;a href="w%3A%20Somalia"&gt;Somalia’s&lt;/a&gt; beleaguered interim government on Wednesday. Yet as the Islamic militia were reportedly massing troops after capturing the country’s capital, &lt;a href="w%3A%20Mogadishu"&gt;Mogadishu&lt;/a&gt; on 11 July, soldiers from Somalia’s neighbour &lt;a href="w%3A%20Ethiopia"&gt;Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt; crossed the country’s borders, sparking vitriolic attacks on both sides. 

The Islamic militants vowed to start a "holy war" against its neighbour, while the Ethiopian Information Minister Berhan Hailu said "We will use all means at our disposal to crush the Islamist group if they attempt to attack Baidoa, the seat of the transitional federal government."

This threat came after Islamist troops, fresh from taking Mogadishu last week, were seen less than 60km from Baidoa. They later pulled their troops back, claiming they were collecting defected troops and not planning an attack. 

A convoy of around 2,000 soldiers were seen crossing the Ethiopian frontier overnight, joining another 2,000 troops already based in the border town of Luk. Others have reported seeing men in Ethiopian uniform inside Baidoa itself.

Despite eyewitness accounts to the contrary, Ethiopia so far denies sending troops into Somalia. Bereket Simon, a government spokesperson, told the &lt;a href="w%3A%20BBC_World_Service"&gt;BBC World Service&lt;/a&gt; that "so far" no government troops were inside the country. However a direct conflict seems more and more likely, as Mr. Simon confirmed that "Ethiopia is in a position to defend itself to ensure the stability of the Horn of Africa". 

The Ethiopian government has openly backed the provisional government which has held a weak power over the country since 1991. The mainly Christian country fears the possibility of the United Islamic Courts ruling Somalia, in light of the strict laws the Islamist Courts impose. 

The latest events have thrown the already troubled peace negotiations into turmoil. Representatives from both the Islamist Courts and the government are in delicate talks in the Sudanese capital &lt;a href="w%3A%20Khartoum"&gt;Khartoum&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3A%20Ali_Mohamed_Gedi"&gt;Ali Mohamed Gedi&lt;/a&gt;, the Somali prime minister urged Islamist troops to stop their advances on the interim capital, pleading for more time for negotiations. Government diplomats boycotted talks last week, but more meetings are set for the 22nd July.

Yet direct conflict seems more and more likely, according to analysts. Despite some loyal troops the provisional government is too weak to take on the Islamist militias, but with Ethiopia now making firm moves to support the besieged government it seems war may come before peace in battle-torn Somalia.

&lt;a href="w%3AJetBlue%20Airways"&gt;JetBlue Airways&lt;/a&gt; launched service from &lt;a href="w%3ARaleigh-Durham%20International%20Airport"&gt;Raleigh-Durham International Airport&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20F.%20Kennedy%20International%20Airport"&gt;John F. Kennedy International Airport&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday, July 20. The airline also announced daily service from &lt;a href="w%3ARaleigh%2C%20North%20Carolina"&gt;Raleigh&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3ABoston%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt; starting on October 18.

JetBlue's service in Raleigh is comprised of four daily flights to New York, the airline's hub.

The route is flown by &lt;a href="w%3AEmbraer%20E-Jets"&gt;EMBRAER 190&lt;/a&gt; aircraft with a capacity of 100 passengers. The aircraft are equipped with &lt;a href="w%3ADirecTV"&gt;DirecTV&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AXM%20Satellite%20Radio"&gt;XM Satellite Radio&lt;/a&gt; programming.

On October 18, JetBlue's service from Raleigh to Boston will begin with one daily flight.

&lt;a href="w%3ARaleigh-Durham%2C%20North%20Carolina"&gt;Raleigh-Durham&lt;/a&gt; International Airport currently has 223 daily departures to 37 cities.

<h1>FDA officials question safety of antibiotic 'Ketek'</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=FDA%20officials%20question%20safety%20of%20antibiotic%20%27Ketek%27&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Times"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reports that safety officials working for the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFood%20and%20Drug%20Administration"&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have expressed concerns over the safety of an antibiotic, &lt;a href="w%3ATelithromycin"&gt;telithromycin&lt;/a&gt; and questioned its approval for use. The drug, marketed under the trade name Ketek, has been widely prescribed since its 2004 FDA approval.

The ♡❤New York Times♡❤ reports that David Graham, one of four FDA safety officials concerned about safety of the antibiotic in both adults and children, wrote in an E-mail message to another agency official that the drug's 2004 U.S. approval was in error and should be withdrawn. 

The concerns focus on the drug's &lt;a href="w%3Aliver%20toxicity"&gt;liver toxicity&lt;/a&gt;, but also extends to vision problems and other nervous system effects (reported blackouts) and worsening of symptoms in patients suffering from &lt;a href="w%3Amyasthenia%20gravis"&gt;myasthenia gravis&lt;/a&gt;. 

The drug has been prescribed more than 5 million times. Liver failure has been reported in fourteen adult patients, four of whom died; another twenty-three sustained "serious liver injury." 

In January 2006, after cases of serious liver toxicity were reported in the ♡❤Annals of Internal Medicine♡❤ (a professional journal published by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Medical%20Association"&gt;American Medical Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ), the FDA issued a public advisory to that effect and, in June, 2006 announced that it had completed its safety assessment and required the manufacturer to add additional warnings about the risks of liver toxicity and for patients with myasthenia gravis to the product labeling.

An F.D.A. spokeswoman, Susan Bro, said, “Every issue or question raised during the Ketek review process and subsequently since approval has been rigorously reviewed by the nation’s best physicians, statisticians and epidemiologists both internal and external to the F.D.A.”

A spokeswoman for drugmaker &lt;a href="w%3ASanofi-Aventis"&gt;Sanofi-Aventis&lt;/a&gt; announced the drug's safety label has already been modified. "We continue to believe that the benefits of Ketek outweigh the risks when the drug is used as directed for its approved indications," said Dr. Sol Rajfer, president of science and medical affairs of Sanofi-Aventis' U.S. division.

Excerpts of Dr. Graham's internal June 16 memorandum published by the ♡❤Times♡❤ reveal strong criticism of the drug's approval. “It’s as if every principle governing the review and approval of new drugs was abandoned or suspended where Telithromycin is concerned,” Dr. Graham wrote. In the document, Graham subsequently advised Telithromycin's "immediate withdrawal" from the U.S. prescription drug market. The ♡❤Times♡❤ characterized the internal FDA climate as a "fierce battle," which is most likely fueled by the increased press attention in recent months. 

Apart from Dr. Graham, who also voiced safety concerns during the Vioxx scandal, three other F.D.A. officials have been identified as critics of Telithromycin's approval: Dr. Charles Cooper, Dr. David Ross and Dr. Rosemary Johann-Liang. Bipartisan congressional interest has also been triggered. Senator &lt;a href="Chuck%20Grassley"&gt;Charles E. Grassley&lt;/a&gt; (R-&lt;a href="Iowa"&gt;Iowa&lt;/a&gt;, chairman, Senate Finance Committee) is "investigating" the issue with Representatives &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEdward%20Markey"&gt;Edward J. Markey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (D-&lt;a href="Massachusetts"&gt;Mass&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHenry%20Waxman"&gt;Henry A. Waxman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (D-&lt;a href="California"&gt;Calif&lt;/a&gt;). 

Although The ♡❤Times♡❤ claimed to receive more than "dozens" of messages (presumably e-mails), the paper did not disclose the source.

&lt;br style="clear:both;"&gt;

Nearly 30 people are now thought to have died after a 4-storey building collapsed in the &lt;a href="w%3ANigeria"&gt;Nigerian&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href="w%3A%20Lagos"&gt;Lagos&lt;/a&gt;. More bodies, some alive, and others dead, are still being recovered from the wreckage in the Ebute Metta area of Lagos after the apartment block suddenly gave in on Tuesday evening, local time. 

The building also housed restaurants and 18 shops on the ground floor and rescuers are unsure of how many people remain trapped below the ground. 

The Nigerian &lt;a href="w%3A%20Red_Cross"&gt;Red Cross&lt;/a&gt; said it believed around 75 people may have been inside, but survivors are claiming the death toll is considerably higher. So far, 50 survivors have been hauled from the wreckage, and still, three days after the collapse, voices are being heard from below the rubble.

"People have survived in this kind of situation for up to five days,” Timothy Oladele, the Chairman of the Nigerian Red Cross told &lt;a href="w%3A%20Reuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;, “We are just in the third day in our own case and by God's grace we will find some alive."

The building, in Nigeria’s largest city, is thought to have been just three years old, and officials are blaming poor construction for the collapse. Local media are reporting that city planners only gave permission for a two storey building on the site, not four. The owner of the construction company is believed to have fled; Lagos Governor Bola Tinubu pledged to punish the rogue developer. ”We know their other buildings and definitely, they will not go unpunished," he told local press today.

The sprawling industrial city of Lagos has a history of poor construction and maintenance. In March 2006, one of the city’s tallest buildings, damaged after a fire, collapsed during a thunderstorm.

In March, Wake County Superior Court Judge Howard Manning threatened to close state high schools that did not meet his expectations. High schools had to meet a passing grade of 55 percent or face large scale reform.

On August 18 Judge Manning will review the state's plan to help the schools that did not meet his goal.

Last month, Governor Easely unveiled a strategy for the low performing schools. Plans include leadership training for administrators and blueprints for improvement.

Several of the failing schools saw a reduction in passing grades over the past year. Durham County's Southern High School fell from 54.1 percent of students passing to 45.6 percent.

Superintendent of Public Instruction June Atkinson said, "I was optimistic that we would see more improvement, but it takes more time to turn around a school than just a year."

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Kent%20Hovind%20faces%20a%2058-count%20federal%20indictment&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Creationist &lt;a href="w%3AKent%20Hovind"&gt;Kent Hovind&lt;/a&gt; was arrested and plead not guilty in a Florida federal court to 58 charges of filing a frivolous lawsuits, false complaints, making threats against investigators and those cooperating with the investigation, and includes failing to pay $473,818 in employee-related taxes.

Last Thursday, U.S. Magistrate Judge Miles Davis heard the charges in which Kent Hovind professed not to understand why he is being prosecuted asserting "I still don't understand what I'm being charged for and who is charging me."

Legal and taxes issues are nothing new for Kent Hovind, who often calls himself "Dr. Dino." He has been in legal trouble with the IRS for at least 17 years on his claims that he is employed by God, receives no income, has no expenses and owns no property.

Hovind's attorney, Assistant Public Defender Kafahni Nkrumah, told U.S. Magistrate Judge Miles Davis that the Hovinds "did not want to enter a plea because he does not believe the United States, the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Attorney's Office "have jurisdiction in this matter."

When Davis said he would enter a plea for Hovind if he continued to refuse, Hovind said he was entering a not guilty plea "under duress." In the exchange Davis asked Hovind "if he wrote and spoke English, this man who claims a doctorate said, 'To some degree'."

Jo Hovind, who is facing 44 charges stood with her husband's hand on her shoulder and "reiterated the gist of his statements."

U.S. District Judge Casey Rodgers will preside over the September 5th trial.

Davis made Hovind surrender his passport, guns, and will not allow him to leave the court's juristition since they consider him a flight risk. On July 21, 2006 a missionary group in South Africa filed a petition to lift the travel restrictions. In part, Hovind claims the travel restrictions "violate the &lt;a href="w%3AReligious%20Freedom%20Restoration%20Act"&gt;Religious Freedom Restoration Act&lt;/a&gt;."

Hovind's public defender Kafahni Nkrumah, states "Mr. Hovind contends that the conditions imposed upon him by Magistrate Davis impose a burden on the free exercise of defendant's religion, in violation of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution."

No date to hear the appeal against the travel restrictions is scheduled.

<h2>Recent case</h2>
In an unrelated case on July 7, 2006 the United States Tax Court (Docket number 011894-05L) found that Hovind was deficient in paying his federal income taxes in tax years 1995-97 in the amount of $504,957.24. The Tax Court found that the IRS had a valid, perfected lien on Hovind's property in that amount. 

The IRS is currently levying against Hovind's property to satisfy his unpaid tax liabilities. In the memorandum opinion the judge noted that Hovind's "organizational structure . . . was based on various questionable trust documents purchased from &lt;a href="w%3AGlen%20Stoll"&gt;Glen Stoll&lt;/a&gt;, a known promoter of tax avoidance schemes." Moreover, Hovind's defense was based on "bizarre arguments" and "some of which constitute tax protestor arguments involving excise taxes and the alleged '100% voluntary' nature of the income tax."

&lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt; fulfilled his promise to use his own assigned airforce aircraft to pick up Canadians fleeing from the assault on Lebanon and who are currently stranded in &lt;a href="w%3ACyprus"&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt;.

About one hundred people were taken on board the Prime Minister's aircraft and flown out of Cyprus with Harper.

Harper, who greeted the evacuees, told the media in an interview that the situation was challenging for the government due to the numbers of Canadians fleeing the war torn region by boat to Cyprus.

Canada has one of the largest groups of nationals in &lt;a href="w%3ALebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; of any country in the world, and has already seen eight citizens killed in an Israeli air strike to date.

"Today has been a successful day, as far as the evacuation has gone," "Nothing is perfect in ideal circumstances, and this is a war zone." said, &lt;a href="w%3AMinister%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs"&gt;Foreign Affairs Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20MacKay"&gt;Peter MacKay&lt;/a&gt;.

A storm has knocked out power during a heat wave in the &lt;a href="w%3AGreater%20St.%20Louis"&gt;Greater St. Louis&lt;/a&gt; Area. 

80 mph (130 km/h) winds accompanied by heavy rain caused many tree limbs to fall, some onto cars, some onto thoroughfares, and some on high-tension power lines that supply the city. It also caused at least three building collapses. 

After 160,000 people have had their power restored, but 500,000 others are still without power. Three hundred national guardsmen joined volunteers, policemen and firefighters in aiding people during the crisis.

Vulnerable residents in nursing homes and centers for the elderly are being evacuated. Cookies and water are being distributed to those needing them. With temperatures were nearing 100°F (38°C), 
ice was in short supply as customers grabbed all they could get their hands on.

"I've never seen this many people without power, this much debris, buildings collapsed, lines down," St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay said.

The local power company, AmerenUE, estimated that as of 10:26 p.m. local Central time on the 20th, 418,195 customers had no electricity.

<h1>Khmer Rouge &quot;Butcher&quot; dies ahead of trial</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Khmer%20Rouge%20%26quot%3BButcher%26quot%3B%20dies%20ahead%20of%20trial&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3ATa%20Mok"&gt;Ta Mok&lt;/a&gt;, also known as the "Butcher", military commander of the &lt;a href="w%3A%20Khmer_Rouge"&gt;Khmer Rouge&lt;/a&gt; regime which terrorised &lt;a href="w%3A%20Cambodia"&gt;Cambodia&lt;/a&gt; in the 1970s, has died in a military hospital in &lt;a href="w%3A%20Phnom_Penh"&gt;Phnom Penh&lt;/a&gt;. He was facing trial for &lt;a href="w%3Agenocide"&gt;genocide&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Acrimes%20against%20humanity"&gt;crimes against humanity&lt;/a&gt; committed during the regime's rule.

Ta Mok had been in detention since 1999 and was recently transferred to prison hospital suffering from high blood pressure and Tuberculosis. The 82-year old had slipped into coma a week ago and died of natural causes, "given his poor health and respiratory problems," a doctor told &lt;a href="w%3A%20Reuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt; today. 

Ta Mok's real name is not known, but reported to be Ek Choeun or Oeung Choeun. He joined the Khmer Rouge after being part of anti-French colonial and anti-Japanese resistance movements, rising to become the &lt;a href="w%3AMaoism"&gt;Maoist&lt;/a&gt; group's Chief-of-Staff. He is believed to have directed the purges of the &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Kampuchea"&gt;Democratic Kampuchea&lt;/a&gt; regime, in which an estimated 1.7 million people were tortured and killed in what is now referred to as "the &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Killing%20Fields"&gt;killing fields&lt;/a&gt;", earning him the name "The Butcher". After the fall of the regime, he continued to lead a faction, until captured by the Cambodian forces in 1999. 

His death leaves only one surviving Khmer Rouge commander, &lt;a href="w%3AKang%20Kek%20Leu"&gt;Kang Kek Leu&lt;/a&gt; ("Duch"), the chief of the &lt;a href="w%3ATuol%20Sleng%20Genocide%20Museum"&gt;Tuol Sleng S-21&lt;/a&gt; interrogation centre to face trial. Most of the other surviving regime leaders are also in poor health. The regime leader &lt;a href="w%3A%20Pol_Pot"&gt;Pol Pot&lt;/a&gt; died in 1998, also before facing trial. This has prompted questions about whether the trials have been delayed too long. The trials are to be conducted before a special tribunal created by Cambodia, with support from the United Nations. 

A spokesman for the tribunal, Reach Sambath, said on Friday that a "key resource of information" had passed away.

Youk Chang, director of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia which is studying the crimes committed by the Khmer Rouge, said his death was "outrageous". "Some people may be happy with this," he told AP, "but not the victims who have been waiting for justice for a long time,"

Ta Mok's nephew Morm Mol said he was "saddened" by his uncle's death.

Ninety &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealanders"&gt;New Zealanders&lt;/a&gt; have been evacuated from war-torn &lt;a href="w%3ALebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; and are on their way to the safety of &lt;a href="w%3ACyprus"&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt;. Three ships are helping in the evacuations, two &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Navy"&gt;British Navy&lt;/a&gt; and one &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; (UN) chartered ferry.

There are 1,500 people on board the two British ships "There are definitely New Zealanders aboard, but there just isn't an actual passenger list. We're hoping there are quite good numbers of New Zealanders onboard," Helen Tunnah, a spokeswoman for the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Ministry%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%20and%20Trade"&gt;New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade&lt;/a&gt; (MFAT), said.

Officer Andrew Greig's family, which includes his wife and two sons, are on board the UN ferry.

This evacuation comes after &lt;a href="w%3ABritain"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt; announced it will conduct a formal evacuation, which also includes New Zealand citizens because New Zealand does not have an embassy in Lebanon. 

&lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; has been attacking Lebanon for three weeks. Hundreds of civilians and two Israeli soldiers have already died due to this conflict as well as two &lt;a href="Hezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt; fighters and about twenty Lebanese soldiers.

&lt;a href="w%3AMFAT"&gt;MFAT&lt;/a&gt; will help the New Zealand evacuees find accommodation and help them with getting travel arrangements. "Because of the sheer number of people wishing to leave, it is expected to take days before the evacuation is completed," Helen Tunnah said.

Microsoft Corporation (&lt;a href="w%3ANASDAQ"&gt;NASDAQ:&lt;/a&gt;MSFT, &lt;a href="w%3AHKSE"&gt;HKSE:&lt;/a&gt;4338) has announced plans to buy back US$40 billion of its stock between now and 2011.

Microsoft, the world's largest maker of computer software, will make a &lt;a href="w%3Atender%20offer"&gt;tender offer&lt;/a&gt; to repurchase $20 billion of its own stock by August 17, and will purchase another $20 billion by 2011. This is in addition to a previous $30 billion stock buyback offer it completed two years ago.

The company plans to accept offers in the form of a modified &lt;a href="w%3ADutch%20auction"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt; or “reverse auction”, and based on those offers for stock, come up with a price no less than $22.50 and no more than $24.75, that allows it to buy up to about 8.1% of the common shares outstanding, up to either 808,080,808 shares, or $20 billion. The company stated that it will not purchase shares below a price stipulated by a shareholder, and in some cases, may actually purchase shares at prices above a shareholder’s indication under the terms of the modified Dutch auction. Prior to the announcement, Microsoft shares were trading at $22.75, with the announcement causing share prices to rise $1.32, or 5.8%, to $24.17.

Microsoft has been criticized in the past for "sitting on" huge reserves of cash without making additional purchases of companies or technology. 

The company expects to sell more units of its Xbox 360 game console, which currently is unprofitable, helping to shore up weaker earnings from its Office flagship software package, of which a new version is not expected until sometime next year.

On July 20 the company said profit for the year will be $1.43 to $1.47 a share, an increase from an April forecast of $1.36 to $1.41. For the quarter ending September, expected profit will be 30-32c/share on revenue of between $10.6-$10.8 billion. For fiscal 2006, earnings were 11% higher than the previous year, at $12.6 billion on revenues of $44.28 billion, or $1.20 per share. In the year-ago quarter, Microsoft reported net income of $3.70 billion, with legal expenses of 5 cents per share plus tax benefits of 9 cents per share. This produced a net income of 34 cents per share for the quarter, opposed to the 31 cents which would have occurred without the tax benefits. For the previous fiscal year, income was $12.25 billion on revenue of $39.79 billion, or $1.13 per share.

Microsoft held an audio web-cast at 2:30 p.m. PDT (5:30 p.m. EDT) July 20 with Chris Liddell, senior vice president and chief financial officer, Frank Brod, corporate vice president and chief accounting officer, and Colleen Healy, general manager of Investor Relations. The session may be accessed at the Microsoft website. The web-cast will be available for replay through the close of business on July 20, 2007.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Thai%20king%20endorses%20October%2015%20general%20election%20rerun&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thailand's&lt;/a&gt; king, &lt;a href="w%3ABhumibol%20Adulyadej"&gt;Bhumibol Adulyadej&lt;/a&gt; has endorsed a decree confirming that the new &lt;a href="w%3AThailand%20legislative%20election%2C%20October%202006"&gt;general election&lt;/a&gt; will take place on October 15, 2006.

The King's proclamation follows on from a year of political turmoil in the country, involving public demonstrations calling for Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AThaksin%20Shinawatra"&gt;Thaksin Shinawatra&lt;/a&gt; to step down amid perceptions of government corruption and legal malfeasance. A series of legal actions against popular public figures and opposition politicians led to further unrest and a surprise decision by Thaksin to hold a &lt;a href="w%3AThailand%20legislative%20election%2C%20April%202006"&gt;snap-election on April 2, 2006&lt;/a&gt;.

An opposition boycott left Thaksin's &lt;a href="w%3AThai%20Rak%20Thai"&gt;Thai Rak Thai&lt;/a&gt; party certain of victory, but unable to meet the conditions of the constitution for opening parliament. By-elections were ordered in areas where unopposed candidates failed to be returned, however the country's constitutional court eventually ruled the April 2 election void due to privacy issues surrounding the arrangement of polling booths.

October's election may not be the final point in the ongoing political crisis, Thai Rak Thai and the opposition &lt;a href="w%3ADemocrat%20Party%20%28Thailand%29"&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt; (Pak Prachatipat), alongside three minor parties, face allegations of election fraud which could lead to any of the parties being dissolved. Unfortunately the volume of evidence presented to the Constitutional Court may lead to a ruling being given after the election.

<h1>Israel masses troops, tanks along Lebanon border</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Israel%20masses%20troops%2C%20tanks%20along%20Lebanon%20border&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; has warned civilians in Southern &lt;a href="w%3ALebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; to leave their homes and villages and move into the city of &lt;a href="w%3ABeirut%2C%20Lebanon"&gt;Beirut&lt;/a&gt; as Israel masses tanks, armored personnel carriers, bulldozers and at least 5 battalions of troops totaling at least 3,000 reserves along its border with Lebanon. Villagers were warned to leave the area before 2:00 p.m. in at least 12 villages in Lebanon that border Israel.

Chief of the Israeli army, Lt. Gen. Dan Halutz says that operations conducted on the ground will be limited. "We shall carry out limited ground operations as necessary in order to strike at the terrorism which strikes at us.", Halutz said during a press conference. Senior Israeli army commanders have left open the possibility that a large-scale ground invasion would soon be launched. "It's possible that in the coming days our ground operations will increase," said Israeli Brigadier-General Alon Friedman

The Lebanese government has warned Israel that if an invasion occurs, the Lebanese army would engage in battle with Israel's army."The Lebanese Army will resist and defend the country and prove that it is an army worth of respect," said Elias Murr, Lebanon's Defense Minister. "Our constitutional duty is to defend Lebanon as a Lebanese army. This is our role. But for the resistance (Hezbollah) to enter the army and fight alongside the army, this is not an option". 

Lebanese President Emile Lahoud said that Lebanon are not going to "let anybody take our land. We are not going to let them come back and take it." However, according to ♡❤Mail &amp; Guardian Online♡❤ which is quoting an anonymous Israeli military official, there will not be a "full-scale incursion into Lebanon."

On the other hand, Lebanese Prime Minister Fuad Siniora was quoted in the Milan-based daily "Corriere della Sera" calling for the disarmament of Hezbollah. "It's not a mystery that Hezbollah answers to the political agendas of Tehran and Damascus," Siniora said to the Corriere. "The entire world must help us disarm Hezbollah. But first we need to reach a cease-fire." Siniora later denied the interview, but "Corriere della Sera" stands by its report. "The interview was recorded," a senior staff member said.

"The important thing now is to restore full Lebanese sovereignty in the south, dismantling any armed militia parallel to the national army," said Siniora. "The Syrians are inside our home and we are still too weak to defend ourselves. The terrible memories of the civil war are still too alive and no one is ready to take up arms."

So far, Lebanon's army has not engaged in battle with Israel's army except for firing anti-aircraft guns at Israeli warplanes.

Meanwhile, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah issued a strongly worded statement indicating, as he has before, that he will not release any Israeli prisoners except through a prisoner-exchange. Nasrallah stated that Israeli reports of having destroyed half of Hezbollah's missile stores were erroneous and that, "the leadership of Hezbollah has not been touched." He promised "more surprises".

While Nasrallah asks for an exchange of Israeli-held prisoners for two IDF soldiers captured by a Hezbollah incursion into Israel following the G8 summit, the UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan called for an immediate cease-fire between the two bordering nations on Thursday. But the UN holds little sway in Lebanon.

The Lebanese government is the first elected by a popular vote following last year's resignation of the Syrian backed government of &lt;a href="w%3AOmar%20Karami"&gt;Omar Karami&lt;/a&gt; in February. Demonstrations and pressure from the international community led to a complete withdrawal by Syria and free and democratic elections in June. The current Israel-Lebanon crisis is the most serious challenge faced by the relatively inexperienced government.

<h1>After Bush leaves Russia, Voice of Russia commentary questions President's intellect</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=After%20Bush%20leaves%20Russia%2C%20Voice%20of%20Russia%20commentary%20questions%20President%27s%20intellect&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

An unusual commentary on the Voice of Russia English-language web site, which has since been removed, claims that President Bush's presumed "narrow intellectual horizons" and "disastrous judgment" have had "cataclysmic" policy consequences. FreeMediaOnline.org reported that the commentary was published a few days after President Bush left Russia, where he had attended the G-8 summit.

FreeMediaOnline.org reported that the publication of such a strong personal attack on a foreign head of state by a government broadcaster in Russia is highly unusual and may indicate a worsening in relations between Moscow and Washington as a result of the war in Iraq and what FreeMediaOnline.org described as the decline of Russian democracy under President Putin. It may also be an indication of Moscow's increased assertiveness in foreign policy thanks to revenues from high energy prices.

The analyst, David Brian, who is a regular Voice of Russia contributor, quoted at length from the July 16 Jonathan Chait's column in The Los Angeles Times: "Is Bush Still Too Dumb to Be President?." in his comment "George W. Bush Has Intuition (Maybe)".
Voice of Russia did not identify Chait by name as the author of the original commentary. Their analyst indicated, however, that he was citing a Los Angeles Times article. The Voice of Russia comment could under normal circumstances been viewed as an example of unusual journalistic freedom.

The title of the Voice of Russia commentary, "George W. Bush Has Intuition (Maybe)," and its tone indicated that the analyst shared the same views about President Bush's intellect as The Los Angeles Times columnist Jonathan Chait. According to FreeMediaOnline.org the 450 word commentary consisted of not much more than a word-for-word repeat of Jonathan Chait's column. 

President Bush received a bachelor's degree in history from Yale University in 1968, and also received a Master of Business Administration from Harvard Business School in 1975.

Voice of Russia is Moscow's state-financed international broadcaster with programs in multiple languages, including English.

Julie and Hillary Goodridge, the lesbian couple who were the lead plaintiffs in the breakthrough case, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AGoodridge%20v.%20Department%20of%20Public%20Health"&gt;Goodridge v. Department of Public Health&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, have decided to separate.

Mary Breslauer, a local political consultant and spokeswoman for the Goodridges confirmed the separation on July 20. In a telephone interview in to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Boston%20Globe"&gt;The Boston Globe&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ newspaper, Breslauer stated, "Julie and Hillary Goodridge are amicably living apart. As always their number one priority is raising their daughter, and like the other plaintiff couples in this case, they made an enormous contribution toward equal marriage. But they are no longer in the public eye, and request that their privacy be respected." She also added that they are not filing for divorce and did not comment anymore on their plans and gave no other details except that couple is focusing on what's best for their 10-year old daughter Annie.

"Unfortunately, lesbian and gay couples break up just as heterosexual couples," said Joyce Kauffman, a &lt;a href="w%3ACambridge%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Cambridge, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;-based gay and lesbian family law lawyer. "It's a fact of life. There are stresses and strains on all of us. And sometimes relationships can't beat that stress. It happens to gay people just as well straight people."

Kris Mineau, president of the conservative public policy group, the Massachusetts Family Institute who are trying to put an amendment on the 2008 ballot that would repeal same-sex marriage rights in Massachusetts said the group doesn't plan to make an issue out of the separation. 

The Goodridges, who are considered by some supporters of gay marriage as the face of the gay marriage cause, met at &lt;a href="w%3AHarvard%20University"&gt;Harvard University&lt;/a&gt; 21 years ago in a course about &lt;a href="w%3ADivestment"&gt;divesting&lt;/a&gt; from South Africa, in which a intense courtship followed. Years before the legalization of gay marriage in the state, they considered themselves to be committed partners.

They and several other gay couples, with the help of &lt;a href="w%3AGay%20and%20Lesbian%20Advocates%20and%20Defenders"&gt;Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders&lt;/a&gt;, filed a lawsuit in which the &lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts%20Supreme%20Judicial%20Court"&gt;Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court&lt;/a&gt; ruled 4-3 on November 18th, 2003 to legalize gay marriage in Massachusetts.

They were married by a &lt;a href="w%3AUnitarian%20Universalist"&gt;Unitarian Universalist&lt;/a&gt; minister on May 17, 2004, the first day that same-sex marriages were legal under the court ruling. Annie served as flower girl and ring-bearer.

The separation was first reported in Bay Windows, a Boston-based LGBT newspaper on July 20.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAll%20Blacks"&gt;All Blacks&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Africa%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; in the third match of the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Tri%20Nations%20Series"&gt;2006 Tri Nations&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Arugby%20union"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; series. The final score was 35 points to 17. The match was played at &lt;a href="w%3AWellington"&gt;Wellington&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AWestpac%20Stadium"&gt;Westpac Stadium&lt;/a&gt;.

The previous week South Africa had gone down nil to 49 at the hands of &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ABrisbane"&gt;Brisbane&lt;/a&gt;. The loss to Australia saw South Africa drop in the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Rugby%20Board"&gt;IRB&lt;/a&gt; international rankings. Prior to South Africa's opening &lt;a href="w%3ATri%20Nations%20Series"&gt;Tri Nations&lt;/a&gt; match, they had unconvincingly beaten &lt;a href="w%3AScotland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; in a two-test series at home in June, which was followed by a loss to &lt;a href="w%3AFrance%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;. As expected, coming into the match in Wellington, head coach &lt;a href="w%3AJake%20White"&gt;Jake White&lt;/a&gt; and his players were under considerable pressure to perform.

The crowd was shocked when South Africa scored the opening &lt;a href="w%3Atry"&gt;try&lt;/a&gt; of the match, when &lt;a href="w%3AFourie%20du%20Preez"&gt;Fourie du Preez&lt;/a&gt; charged down a &lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Carter"&gt;Dan Carter&lt;/a&gt; kick, to score just 17 seconds after kick-off. &lt;a href="w%3APercy%20Montgomery"&gt;Percy Montgomery&lt;/a&gt; added the conversion for a surprising 7-0 lead to the South Africans. However, the All Blacks were able to get in front by halftime, with Carter kicking four penalty goals and &lt;a href="w%3APiri%20Weepu"&gt;Piri Weepu&lt;/a&gt; scoring on the stroke of half-time.

More New Zealand penalties followed within the second half, however, when &lt;a href="w%3ABreyton%20Paulse"&gt;Breyton Paulse&lt;/a&gt; scored an impressive try off a cross-field kick, South Africa were back in the game, with the All Blacks leading 25 to 17 with just under 10 minutes remaining. The match was sealed with another penalty kick by Carter, and a late try from All Black captain &lt;a href="w%3ARichie%20McCaw"&gt;Richie McCaw&lt;/a&gt;.

The Union of Islamic Courts has broken off peace talks with &lt;a href="w%3ASomalia"&gt;Somalia's&lt;/a&gt; interim government as the country slides closer towards major military conflict.

The Islamists blamed the influx of soldiers from neighbouring &lt;a href="w%3AEthiopia"&gt;Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt; for the end of talks. In a press statement this morning, the UIC leader Sheikh Sharif Ahmed said "We do not negotiate with a government which is being helped by the enemy of Somalia."

The two sides were due to continue what have become increasingly hostile talks this weekend in the &lt;a href="w%3ASudan"&gt;Sudanese&lt;/a&gt; capital, &lt;a href="w%3AKhartoum"&gt;Khartoum&lt;/a&gt;. The weakened interim government led by President &lt;a href="w%3AAbdullahi_Yusuf"&gt;Abdullahi Yusuf&lt;/a&gt; is currently based in the town of Baidoa, north of the capital &lt;a href="w%3AMogadishu"&gt;Mogadishu&lt;/a&gt;, which the Islamic militias captured earlier in July; the UIC now control most of southern Somalia.

The breakdown of talks comes as eyewitnesses report seeing more Ethiopian troops crossing the border. It's believed around 5,000 are now stationed in the country, attempting to protect President Yusuf's fragile government. The &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; is reporting 200 Ethiopian troops have captured an airfield outside Waajid early this morning, but the Ethiopian government has yet to confirm this &amp;mdash; so far they have denied all military intervention and it is not clear if there was any fighting in the town. 
Ethiopia's involvement has angered the Islamist militia who vowed a "holy war" against the mainly Christian state if soldiers were sent in. Ethiopia meanwhile has threatened to "crush" the Islamists should they attempt to take Baidoa. 

The brewing crisis in the &lt;a href="w%3AHorn_of_Africa"&gt;horn of Africa&lt;/a&gt; could get more complex, as Ethiopia’s other hostile neighbour &lt;a href="w%3AEritrea"&gt;Eritrea&lt;/a&gt; has been implicated in supplying the militia with arms. "The Eritrean support is the backbone of the Islamists' military structure," one unnamed local analyst told Reuters. John Prendergast from the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational_crisis_group"&gt;International Crisis Group&lt;/a&gt; has grimly warned that "The risk of full-scale war increases by the day."

&lt;br style="clear:both;"&gt;

The UK Film Council has said &lt;a href="w%3ACinema%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom"&gt;British films&lt;/a&gt; claimed a record one-third share of UK cinema takings last year.

The council has also revealed that &lt;a href="w%3AHarry%20Potter%20and%20the%20Goblet%20of%20Fire%20%28film%29"&gt;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&lt;/a&gt; was Britain's top-grossing film in 2005 after taking £435m ($808m) at the &lt;a href="w%3ABox%20Office"&gt;Box Office&lt;/a&gt; worldwide. It was one of eight British films to be included in the top 20 list of the world's biggest grossing movies. &lt;a href="w%3ACharlie%20and%20the%20Chocolate%20Factory%20%28film%29"&gt;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABatman%20Begins"&gt;Batman Begins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AKingdom%20of%20Heaven%20%28film%29"&gt;Kingdom of Heaven&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AWallace%20%26amp%3B%20Gromit%3A%20The%20Curse%20of%20the%20Were-Rabbit"&gt;Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Hitchhiker%27s%20Guide%20to%20the%20Galaxy%20%28film%29"&gt;The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANanny%20McPhee"&gt;Nanny McPhee&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APride%20and%20Prejudice%20%282005%20film%29"&gt;Pride and Prejudice&lt;/a&gt; took £1.8bn ($3.3) in total globally and were seen by 600 million people. 

John Woodward, the chief executive officer of the UK Film Council, said: "The figures show that the public love British films and 2005 was a great year for British films at the cinema with the largest slice of Box Office takings since records began."

&lt;a href="w%3ATessa%20Jowell"&gt;Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell|&lt;/a&gt;, who has exposed tax incentives aimed at luring filmmakers to the UK, said: "Harry Potter, Nanny McPhee and Willy Wonka have all been hits at home and abroad - helping us achieve great success at the Box Office. I hope that next year, buoyed by the new tax incentive, the UK film industry will be in even better health."

The amount of British people viewing foreign language films also increased. More than 200 foreign language films in 32 different languages were shown at cinemas across the UK. &lt;a href="w%3ADownfall%20%28film%29"&gt;Downfall&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt;-produced movie depicting the final days of &lt;a href="w%3AAdolf%20Hitler"&gt;Adolf Hitler&lt;/a&gt;, was the most popular, according to the council. 

Movies are classed as being UK-made if they are filmed in the country, star UK personalities, and invest money in the UK or on British staff and services.

More than 650 people have now died after a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Atsunami"&gt;tsunami&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; hit the &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;n island of &lt;a href="Java"&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt; on Monday afternoon. In the past few days, around 100 dead bodies have been recovered, and it is estimated that over 300 people are still missing. An underwater &lt;a href="earthquake"&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt; with a magnitude of 7.7 triggered the deadly wave which ravaged a 200km stretch of Java's southern coast.
Thousands of people are continuing to camp in the hills. They are too apprehensive to return home due to fears of another tsunami, but according to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , health officials are worried about the threat of disease among those who are still in refuge. "The risk of catching diseases is there because they live in an open area with limited tents and water," said Rustan Pakaya, from the health ministry's crisis centre. He added that people were being given injections to protect them from diseases like &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ameasles"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Atetanus"&gt;tetanus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acholera"&gt;cholera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . 

Areas worst hit, like the small town of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APangandaran"&gt;Pangandaran&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , are beginning to return to normal, and many businesses there have begun to open up again. "The market and many shops are already open today and although they are not operating fully, things are slowly returning to normal," district spokesman Wasdi bin Umri told AFP.

Yesterday, Indonesia's President, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASusilo%20Bambang%20Yudhoyono"&gt;Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; toured &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APangandaran"&gt;Pangandaran&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and met people who were staying in a temporary camp. The Indonesian government has been criticised for failing to inform residents living on the coast that a tsunami was looming. After the underwater earthquake was detected, &lt;a href="US"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;ese agencies issued warning notices, but the government has admitted it was unable to transmit the bulletins to coastal areas. Speaking yesterday, Mr Yudhoyono vowed to hasten efforts to build an early warning system planned after the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2004%20Asian%20tsunami"&gt;2004 Asian tsunami&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . "We want to expedite efforts to get infrastructure for the tsunami warning system in place," &lt;a href="Associated%20Press"&gt;AP&lt;/a&gt; quoted him as saying. "I will work with parliament to get the budget".

Because the morgue in south Lebanon's city Tyre is full of dead people killed by indirect fire, 86 victims, more than half children, were buried in a mass grave near the hospital. Since there are only few people left in Tyre and the dead often consist whole families, only twenty people were present at the funeral.

Three victims have still not been identified. DNA samples were extracted, in hopes of identifying them.

A report is published by &lt;a href="w%3AHuman%20Rights%20Watch"&gt;Human Rights Watch&lt;/a&gt; on treatment of prisoners in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; by US soldiers after the &lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Ghraib%20torture%20and%20prisoner%20abuse"&gt;Abu Ghraib prison scandal&lt;/a&gt;. It claims torture and other abuses against detainees in US custody in Iraq continues and is authorised and routine. The report includes detailed accounts of abuse from detention centers throughout Iraq, and allegations from an Army interrogator stationed at &lt;a href="w%3ACamp%20Nama"&gt;Camp Nama&lt;/a&gt; at Baghdad International Airport. 

The 55-page report titled ♡❤No Blood, No Foul: Soldiers' Accounts of Detainee Abuse in Iraq♡❤ claims that that harsh interrogation techniques were approved by commanders. Soldiers describe how detainees were routinely subjected to severe beatings, painful stress positions, severe sleep deprivation, and exposure to extreme cold and hot temperatures. The accounts come from interviews conducted by Human Rights Watch, supplemented by memoranda and sworn statements contained in declassified documents.

Marc Garlasco, Human Rights Watch military analyst, said "Up to now, a lot of allegations and evidence has been floating around about authorization up the chain of command of abusive techniques," "MPs on trial tried to raise this in their defense and got nowhere. For the first time, we have been provided clear information on the scope of authorization of abusive techniques, and it points directly to officers in charge and the Pentagon."

John Sifton, researcher at Human Rights Watch said "Soldiers were told that the Geneva Conventions did not apply, and that interrogators could use abusive techniques to get detainees to talk."
The &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Defense"&gt;Department of Defense&lt;/a&gt; denies any Pentagon approval for any abuse.

Lt. Col. Mark Ballesteros, a Pentagon spokesman says "DoD policy has and always will be the humane treatment of detainees in its custody." He said there is a task force in Iraq that oversees detainee operations and has made a dozen reviews of detainee policies. None of the reviews found that the Department of Defense ever ordered or condoned detainee abuse.

The Human Rights Watch report recommends appointing a bipartisan commission to investigate the range of detainee abuse in Iraq, overhauling the military justice system, and appointing an independent prosecutor to investigate and prosecute those responsible.

Marc Garlasco said "In the current situation of long occupations in Iraq and Afghanistan with troop rotation, there is no reason an independent prosecutor can't deal with abuse allegations," "It would make a difference if the E-3 (private first class) in the field saw some senior officers or flags that had authorized abuse being tried in courts-martial instead of promoted."

Gay activists said they were pelted with eggs and bags of &lt;a href="w%3Aexcrement"&gt;excrement&lt;/a&gt; yesterday in &lt;a href="w%3ARiga"&gt;Riga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALatvia"&gt;Latvia&lt;/a&gt; after a service at the Anglican church, and at a press conference and pride conference at Reval Hotel Latvia. In these and other incidents, 14 people in total were arrested.

Māris Sants, co-organizer of the gay pride festival, told Reuters that police didn't provide protection for participants at the church service. Police officials stated that they were not informed about the event, but did arrive after a few minutes, and later confirmed that five people were arrested in connection with this incident.

More than a hundred protesters gathered near Reval Hotel Latvia, where gay activists were organizing a conference. Protesters were from the organization "NoPride", the party "&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Power%20Unity"&gt;Nacionālā Spēka Savienība&lt;/a&gt;" (NSS), and other groups.

LGBT activist Gastons Lakombe told ♡❤Apollo♡❤ internet portal that the most dangerous incident occurred on the Jurmala highway, when a few cars tried to "drive a taxi ferrying gay activists off the road. According to Lakombe, protesters attacked the taxi first at the Reval Hotel, Latvia, by throwing eggs and bottles of water. A few cars followed and on the Jurmala highway "made some dangerous maneuvers, that seriously frightened passengers", said Imants Kozlovskis, an LGBT activist who was inside the taxi.

Gay pride marches were banned this year by the Riga City council. The Administrative Court refused to remove the ban a few days later, citing security considerations.

During protests against "Riga pride 2005" last year, eight people were arrested for trying to block a gay parade and for throwing eggs on the parade participants.

While whole blocks of &lt;a href="w%3ABeirut"&gt;Beirut&lt;/a&gt; are leveled to rubble and civilians flee by the thousands, the U.S. administration is, according to the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Times"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; expediting a delivery of bombs to Israel. An op-ed piece in the Sydney Morning Herald concludes that the sale of more American arms to the Israeli arm will cause anger and might be used to justify Iran supplying missiles to Hezbollah. According to Arab political analysts the decision to rush more bombs to Israel will increase existing anti-American feelings in the Middle East and will help radicals.

The rushing of more bombs to Israel is consistent with US policy, according to a report issued three days ago by the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Policy%20Institute"&gt;World Policy Institute&lt;/a&gt; which indicates that Israel has always been the largest recipient of military aid from the United States. According to Frida Berrigan, co-author of the review entitled ♡❤U.S. Military Assistance and Arms Transfers to Israel: U.S. Aid, Companies Fuel Israeli Military♡❤, U.S. military aid to Israel is about $3 billion a year. This equates to about 20% of the Israeli military budget annually. According to Berrigan, in an interview given to &lt;a href="w%3ADemocracy%20Now"&gt;Democracy Now&lt;/a&gt; on Friday, just on the 14th of July while calling for restraint the U.S. also sold $120 million worth of jet fuel to the Israeli military assisting their bombing campaign of Lebanon. In fact, Berrigan said, since the Bush administration came into power, about a total of $6.3 billion worth of weapons sold to Israel. Berrigan also added that if in fact the United States wanted to cut military aid at this time they have precedent to do so, citing as an example the Reagan administration's cut of military aid and freezing of weapons sales to Israel during its last invasion of Lebanon in 1981, during the then conflict's first 10 weeks. 

Israel claims they have been using precision-guided munitions in order to neutralize Hezbollah and to minimize harm to civilians. However, U.N. and Lebanese officials estimate at least 360 Lebanese civilians have been killed and more than 1,000 wounded, with about 700,000 people already displaced since Israel's bombings began. According to the United Nation's emergency relief co-coordinator, Jan Egeland, nearly one third of casualties resulting from the Israeli offensive in Lebanon have been children. Egeland, who visited Lebanon today denounced the Israeli strikes and appealed for safe passage for aid, saying civilians were paying a "disproportionate price" in the attacks targeting Hezbollah strongholds. He said civilians are paying a disproportionate price in Lebanon and northern Israel and stated that "A disproportionate response by Israel is a violation of international humanitarian law."

In many capital cities around the world including the Middle East, as well as Europe, Canada, Latin America and the United States thousands of people took part in demonstrations against the Israeli strikes. In London people marched to the US embassy and shouted slogans such as "George Bush, terrorist" and "Down, down, USA." In Tel Aviv 1,000 Israeli Jews and Arabs also turned out to denounce their country's actions, gathering in Rabin Square and brandishing placards reading "war is disaster" and "Jews and Arabs refuse to be enemies."

&lt;a href="w%3ASaddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt; has been rushed to hospital after being on &lt;a href="w%3Ahunger%20strike"&gt;hunger strike&lt;/a&gt; for more than two weeks, prosecutors at his trial in &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt; have announced. 

He and three co-defendants have refused to eat for sixteen days. They have been demanding more security for their defence lawyers, three of whom have been murdered. 

Saddam Hussein and seven co-defendants are on trial charged with &lt;a href="w%3Acrimes%20against%20humanity"&gt;crimes against humanity&lt;/a&gt; after Hussein allegedly ordered his special security and military forces to kill 148 people from the village of &lt;a href="w%3ADujail"&gt;Dujail&lt;/a&gt; following an attempted assassination of the former Iraqi leader in 1982.

Chief prosecutor Jaafar al-Musawi has said the 68 year-old will not be well enough to appear before judges on Monday. "Saddam Hussein has just been admitted to hospital because of his hunger strike. A medical report has established that he cannot appear tomorrow, because his condition needs medical attention," he told AFP today.

&lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesian&lt;/a&gt; officials have said an underwater &lt;a href="w%3Aearthquake"&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt; measuring 6.6 on the &lt;a href="w%3ARichter%20scale"&gt;Richter scale&lt;/a&gt; has erupted off the Indonesian island of &lt;a href="w%3ASulawesi"&gt;Sulawesi&lt;/a&gt;. At first, officials told residents to flee coastal areas as a safety measure, but they later said there had been no &lt;a href="w%3Atsunami"&gt;tsunami&lt;/a&gt;. According to reports, no damage has been caused. 

Last week, an underwater quake with a magnitude of 7.7 produced a tsunami that ravaged a 200km stretch of &lt;a href="w%3AJava"&gt;Java's&lt;/a&gt; southern coast. Six hundred and fifty people perished after the deadly two-metre high tidal wave struck, and it is estimated that over three hundred people are still missing. 

Navy boats and marine police have been searching for dead bodies off Java's coast, but according to the &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;, rough seas today have forced teams to abort their operations.
Regions hardest hit, like the small town of &lt;a href="w%3APangandaran"&gt;Pangandaran&lt;/a&gt;, are starting to return to normality. However, people who have taken refuge in camps are refusing to return home due to fears of another tsunami.

&lt;a href="w%3ASusilo%20Bambang%20Yudhoyono"&gt;Indonesia's President&lt;/a&gt; has said efforts to build an early warning system planned after the &lt;a href="w%3A2004%20Asian%20tsunami"&gt;2004 Asian tsunami&lt;/a&gt; are to be accelerated. His government has been criticised as to why local people weren't informed that a tsunami was imminent last week.

More than half a million people have been displaced in &lt;a href="w%3ALebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; as the conflict between &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Hezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt; continues into its second week. The UN relief coordinator Jan Egeland, who visited Beirut said that a humanitarian crisis was unfolding in the country and outlined planned relief efforts. Efforts are underway to open a safe corridor to allow aid shipments to be sent to Lebanon. The evacuation of foreign nationals from Lebanon continues. Israel launched more air strikes and also a ground incursion into Lebanon, and Hezbollah launched rocket attacks on northern Israel.

<h2>UN relief coordinator visits Beirut</h2>

&lt;a href="w%3AUndersecretary-General%20for%20Humanitarian%20Affairs%20and%20Emergency%20Relief%20Coordinator"&gt;UN relief coordinator&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJan%20Egeland"&gt;Jan Egeland&lt;/a&gt; flew to &lt;a href="w%3ABeirut"&gt;Beirut&lt;/a&gt; for a 48 hour visit to Lebanon focused on assistance required by people displaced or trapped by the conflict.

He visited Haret Hreik, a crowded Beirut neighborhood where Hezbollah had its headquarters, hours after it was bombed by Israel. Calling the destruction there "horrific", he said, "I did not know it was block after block of houses... It makes it a violation of humanitarian law". Mr. Egeland appealed for both sides to put a halt to attacks.

The Israeli government said the military was trying to be as precise as possible in its operations in Lebanon. "The Lebanese people are not our enemy. We cannot sit idly by while Hezbollah terrorists launch rockets at our towns and cities," Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Mark Regev said.

Mr. Egeland said there was a humanitarian crisis unfolding in Lebanon, and more than half a million people were directly affected. He said that wounded people were unable to get treatment, no safe drinking water was available and that tens of thousands of civilians were caught in the crossfire between the Israeli Defense Forces and Hezbollah militants, particularly in south Lebanon. He expected the number of displaced to increase "dramatically" as Israel has warned the population of south Lebanon to leave the area ahead of possible new military action there.

Outlining plans for a "major" relief operation, he called for an end to violence to facilitate the aid effort, saying, "We can't get relief into the country in any quantity or distribute it beyond a few points".
<h2>Situation in Lebanon</h2>
The Lebanese newspaper ♡❤Daily Star♡❤ reports that the number of displaced people in Lebanon passed 900,000 on Friday, with close to 40,000 refugees in Beirut itself. Other estimates place the number of refugees between half a million and a million. 

Israel has urged the remaining people living in south Lebanon to leave, and streams of people, some carrying white flags, are making their way from the south. 

About 42,000 refugees had flooded into the city of &lt;a href="w%3ASidon"&gt;Sidon&lt;/a&gt; from the surrounding countryside - believing it to be safe from attacks - when it was hit by Israeli strikes today.

In several towns and cities, food, medical supplies and fuel stocks are running low, and municipal authorities have expressed their inability to assist people. They have called for urgent shipments of food products such as milk, rice, sugar and canned meat; diapers and kitchen tools; medicine such as insulin, painkillers, antibiotics and chlorine to clean water; sterilized gloves; refrigerators to store medicine; tents; electrical generators of 5, 10, 20 and 30 kVA; blankets and other necessities.

In the government hospital in the Al-Bass Palestinian refugee camp, the mass burial of 86 bodies was begun, after rising casualties overwhelmed the local morgue. 

<h3>Infrastructure hit</h3>
The air strikes and bombardment of roads, bridges and trucks has made supplying aid to affected areas even more difficult. Lebanon's only international airport has been out of action since the first days of the conflict. Reports estimate that billions of dollars worth of infrastructure has been destroyed.

<h2>UN plans relief operation</h2>
The UN relief coordinator Jan Egeland spoke to reporters of the plans for getting aid to Lebanon. He said UN supplies of humanitarian aid would begin to arrive in the next few days. "But we need safe access," he said. "So far Israel is not giving us access." He estimated that US $100 million is urgently needed to help the half a million to one million people in Lebanon who were in need of international assistance. 

U.N. and other relief agencies have been asking for humanitarian aid corridors to be opened up. Israel said it opened a 50-mile-long and five-mile-wide (80-kilometre by eight-kilometre) safe passage to Beirut for ships and aircraft to allow aid into Lebanon.

Egeland said the United Nations was planning to deliver aid by setting up humanitarian corridors in the next few days. Aid will be shipped by road and by sea from Cyprus to Beirut and the southern city of Tyre, and by air. 

The evacuation of foreign nationals from Lebanon continues, with most being taken to the island of Cyprus, where temporary accommodation has to be found for the estimated 70,000 evacuees, in the middle of the holiday tourist season. 

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Interim%20Force%20in%20Lebanon"&gt;United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; (UNIFIL) says that it plans to evacuate civilians from the Lebanese-Israeli border in the next few days, but "the ability to move will depend on the situation on the ground".

<h2>Situation in Israel</h2>
Meanwhile, thousands of Israelis have been living in bomb shelters since the fighting in Lebanon started and between a third to a half of all residents in northern Israel have left the area to escape the bombardment, officials said.
"For a week people have been sitting in shelters and security rooms, so they prefer to leave," said Adi Eldar, mayor of Carmiel in a report on ♡❤Haaretz♡❤ newspaper's Web site.

<h2>Attacks continue</h2>
On Saturday, more television stations and mobile telephone masts in Lebanon were targeted in Israeli strikes, killing five people, including a television station employee.

Israel struck Beirut, Sidon, a port city in the south crammed with refugees, for the first time and factories, roads and bridges in air strikes in the eastern &lt;a href="w%3ABaalbek"&gt;Baalbek&lt;/a&gt; region, killing one person.

In &lt;a href="w%3AHaifa"&gt;Haifa&lt;/a&gt;, two people were killed by rockets fired by Hezbollah forces, and fifteen people are reported injured.

<h2>Casualty figures rise</h2>
Current estimates say that more than 350 Lebanese and at least 36 Israelis have been killed in the conflict. One third of those killed in Lebanon are children, according to a UN report released July 21.

<h2>Headlines</h2>
<h3>&lt;a href="Earthquake%20strikes%20off%20Indonesia"&gt;Earthquake strikes off Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;</h3>

Indonesia

United States

While whole blocks of Beirut are leveled to rubble and civilians flee by the thousands, the Bush administration is rushing a delivery of bombs to Israel, according to the New York Times. According to an article in the Sydney Morning Herald the sale of more American arms to the Israeli army will cause anger and might be used to justify Iran supplying missiles to Hezbollah.

Two children living in a bach (a small holiday home) in &lt;a href="w%3AMotueka"&gt;Motueka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; died in a fire on Saturday night. The two children who perished in the 10.25 p.m. fire were an 11-year-old girl, Charna Maria Baileys Edwards and a 12-year-old boy, Whetumarama James Edwards.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Police"&gt;New Zealand Police&lt;/a&gt; say that the cause of the fire was ashes taken from a log fire and then placed in a plastic bucket. The ashes then reignited.

Also injured in the fire was the children's grandmother, 54-year-old, legal guardian to the two children, and an uncle, 34. A firefighter also received minor injuries. They are all being treated in Nelson Hospital and are in a stable condition.

Grief counsellors have been sent to Lower Moutere School where the two children went to school. Eric Davies, principal of Lower Moutere School, told &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Radio"&gt;National Radio&lt;/a&gt; "The families of the classes that the children were in have been contacted and asked if they could discuss it with their kids."

Kevin Whitlow, a witness to the fire, told ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Press"&gt;The Press&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ "It was horrendous knowing there were two children stuck in there and there was nothing you could do because it was already too late. The woman just kept saying, `Save my grandchildren, my grandchildren are in there'."

The &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle"&gt;Space Shuttle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Atlantis"&gt;Atlantis&lt;/a&gt; has entered final preparation for mission &lt;a href="w%3ASTS-115"&gt;STS-115&lt;/a&gt;, and has begun movement from its hangar at the &lt;a href="w%3AOrbiter%20Processing%20Facility"&gt;OPF&lt;/a&gt;, to the &lt;a href="w%3AVehicle%20Assembly%20Building"&gt;VAB&lt;/a&gt;, where it will be attached to its external tank and solid rocket boosters. The first motion occurred at 11:34 GMT (07:34 EDT)

This will be the third mission since the &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Columbia%20disaster"&gt;loss of the Space Shuttle Columbia&lt;/a&gt; on mission STS-107, and the first &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Space%20Station"&gt;ISS&lt;/a&gt; assembly mission in four years. It will also be the first time Atlantis has flown since 2002.

The move, which is currently in progress, is expected to take about an hour. Rollout to the pad is scheduled for August 1st, ahead of an August 28th launch date. It is possible that these may be brought forward for an August 27th launch, which would make it the first time in &lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; history a manned spaceflight has occurred earlier than originally scheduled.

The flight will deliver a truss and solar panels to the space station.

Technology giants &lt;a href="w%3AAMD"&gt;Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AATI%20Technologies"&gt;ATI Technologies Inc. (ATI)&lt;/a&gt; today announced plans to merge. Canadian &lt;a href="w%3AATI%20Technologies"&gt;ATI&lt;/a&gt; will be bought by the Californian &lt;a href="w%3AAMD"&gt;AMD&lt;/a&gt; for 5.4 billion dollars ($4.2 billion in cash and $1.2 billion in &lt;a href="w%3Astock"&gt;stock&lt;/a&gt;).
The &lt;a href="w%3AATI%20Technologies"&gt;ATI Technologies Inc. (ATI)&lt;/a&gt; acquisition is being funded by a $2.5 billion loan, plus cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment balances of approximately $3.0 billion. That’s total funding of $5.5 billion.
Many people believe &lt;a href="w%3AAMD"&gt;Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)&lt;/a&gt; to be taking too much of a risk, that &lt;a href="w%3AAMD"&gt;AMD&lt;/a&gt; is "betting the farm on a deal that might be very questionable."

The new firm will employ near 14900 people for 7.3 billions dollars earning.
The two firms announced they'll plan no job cutting in the process of merging.

&lt;a href="w%3APope%20Benedict%20XVI"&gt;Pope Benedict XVI&lt;/a&gt; called on people of all religions to join Sunday's worldwide day of prayers for peace on Friday July 21, 2006.

The Pope spent an hour hiking in the Big Paradise National Park, returning to his mountain retreat just as rain started to fall. He said the gorgeous mountain vistas further impressed on him the gravity of the crisis.

"I think it is best to leave that to the diplomats, because we don't enter politics. But we do everything for peace. Our goal is simply peace, and we will do everything to help attain peace," Pope Benedict XVI said, after he returned from an hour-long hike in the &lt;a href="w%3AAlps"&gt;Italian Alps&lt;/a&gt;.

"Especially from Lebanon, who implored us, as they have implored the &lt;a href="w%3APolitics%20of%20Italy"&gt;Italian government&lt;/a&gt;, to help." "We will help with our prayers and with the people we have in &lt;a href="w%3ALebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;," said the pope.

"Seeing this peace that God gives me, I am even more struck by the suffering of many others," he said.

People around the world prayed for peace. In Washington &lt;a href="w%3ARoman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Washington"&gt;Archbishop Donald W. Wuerl&lt;/a&gt;, repeated the &lt;a href="w%3AVatican"&gt;Vatican's&lt;/a&gt; call for an immediate &lt;a href="w%3ACeasefire"&gt;cease-fire&lt;/a&gt;.

The auction house &lt;a href="w%3ABonhams%20and%20Goodman"&gt;Bonhams and Goodman&lt;/a&gt; have sold the last privately owned &lt;a href="w%3AVictoria%20Cross"&gt;Victoria Cross&lt;/a&gt;(VC) awarded at the World War I &lt;a href="w%3ABattle%20of%20Gallipoli"&gt;Gallipoli campaign&lt;/a&gt; in Sydney tonight. The medal was awarded to New Zealand-born Australian soldier &lt;a href="w%3AAlfred%20John%20Shout"&gt;Captain Alfred Shout&lt;/a&gt;. The sale price of $A 1 million surpassed the previous record of $A575,000 set in 2004 for the VC medal awarded to Sergeant &lt;a href="w%3ANorman%20Jackson"&gt;Norman Jackson&lt;/a&gt; of the RAF 1944.

The Victoria Cross is the highest recognition for valour "in the face of the enemy" that can be awarded to members of the &lt;a href="w%3AGreat%20Britain"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACommonwealth"&gt;Commonwealth&lt;/a&gt; armed forces and civilians under military command. It is also the highest award in the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Honours%20system"&gt;British Honours system&lt;/a&gt;.

The buyer is an Australian businessman, auctioneer Mr Tim Goodman said "I can confirm the buyer is a prominent Australian businessman who is going to work with the RSL to make sure the medals go on display at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra.", after commissions and other charges the successful buyer will pay $A1,214,500.

The addition of this medal will take the display of Victoria Crosses at the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20War%20Memorial"&gt;Australian War Memorial&lt;/a&gt; to 60. The display will include all nine Victoria Crosses awarded to Australian servicemen at Gallipoli.

Class of 2006 students who have so far failed to conquer the &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%20High%20School%20Exit%20Exam"&gt;California High School Exit Exam&lt;/a&gt; (CAHSEE) will continue the struggle today in classrooms across the state, and also in a San Francisco courtroom.

Some of the nearly one in ten members of the Class of 2006 who still haven't passed the CAHSEE weeks after their scheduled graduations, including dozens from &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Logan%20High%20School"&gt;James Logan High School's&lt;/a&gt; Class of 2006, will get another crack at it starting today at high schools around the state, when schools administer an additional last chance two-day test, added to the testing schedule in April in response to the number of seniors who still hadn't passed.

Meanwhile, &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California's&lt;/a&gt; First District Appellate Court of California this morning will begin hearing arguments in a lawsuit that aims to prohibit the state from requiring students to pass the test, and force it to give them the diplomas they currently lack.

According to testing statistics released by the &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%20Department%20of%20Education"&gt;California Department of Education&lt;/a&gt;, 1,759 California seniors passed the test when they took it in May, the last time the test was administered, bringing the total percentage of last year's seniors to pass the test to an estimated 90.8 percent, or 396,201 of 436,374 members of the Class of 2006.

However, that number does not include over 22,000 special education students who were not required to pass the test this year.

&lt;a href="w%3AState%20Superintendent%20of%20Public%20Instruction"&gt;State Superintendent of Public Instruction&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJack%20O%27Connell"&gt;Jack O'Connell&lt;/a&gt;, who wrote the law which required students to pass the test when he was a state legislator, expressed muted pleasure at the results, which indicate a narrowing of the "achievement gap" between racial groups. "While I will not be satisfied until all California students are successful in gaining the skills measured by the exit exam, I am pleased that the achievement gap is narrowing," O'Connell said. "It is clear that all students are working hard to gain the critical skills necessary for a diploma and for survival in today's global economy. I credit the exit exam for focusing both students and schools on meeting this challenge. We need to sustain this effort until the achievement gap is erased completely."

"Eighty-five percent of Hispanic students in the Class of 2006 have passed the test, with 19.7 percent passing during the junior year and nearly 11 percent passing in their senior year," according to a statement released by O'Connell. "By comparison, 11.5 percent of white students passed as juniors and 4.1 percent of white students passed as seniors. Eighty-three percent of African American students have passed the test, with 20.6 percent passing as juniors and 12 percent passing as seniors."

About 70 seniors at James Logan High School, mostly minorities and those who are learning English, had to take the May test.

O'Connell said that the estimated 40,173 students who haven't passed the test should not give up trying to get a high school diploma or more education: "I urge these students to continue to work in summer school, take a fifth year of high school, or study in adult school or community college to acquire those important skills in English and math," O'Connell said. "This exam benefits students who are still struggling by focusing them on areas they need to strengthen so they can have more successful futures."

The last chance to pass the 2006 test begins this morning, as seniors and adult school students begin taking the English/Language Arts portion of the CAHSEE. Tomorrow, the Mathematics portion of the test will be administered. The summer administration of the test starting today was added to the testing schedule in April, in response to requests from school districts around the state.

In the court case against the test, the California Court of Appeals will hear argument at 9:30 a.m. at 350 McAllister in &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;.

In court, Arturo Gonzalez, lead attorney in the case, Valenzuela vs. O'Connell, named for Liliana Valenzuela, a Richmond High School student, will try to convince the First Appellate Court of California to uphold a Superior Court judge's May ruling blocking the state's use of the test, on the grounds that it's use as a graduation requirement was unconstitutional because poor and minority students don't have access to equal educational resources, and therefore don't have equal protection under the law.

The judge, Robert Freedman of &lt;a href="w%3AAlameda%20County"&gt;Alameda County&lt;/a&gt;, issued an injunction against the use of the test, briefly giving hope of graduation without passing to thousands of students statewide, but O'Connell appealed to the state Supreme Court and they stayed the judge's injunction, allowing the state to order schools to deny diplomas to those who hadn't passed the test. The Supreme Court also ordered the First District Appellate Court to hear the case, which the court scheduled for today.

"If the appellate court affirms the injunction, then any student who has passed all of his or her required courses will receive a high school diploma," Gonzalez said in an e-mail to the &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Logan%20Courier"&gt;James Logan Courier&lt;/a&gt;.

The two-day exam tests students on middle school level math and algebra and ninth and 10th grade-level English. Students take the test for the first time as sophomores, again as juniors if they didn’t pass it as 10th graders, and several times as seniors if needed.

A 23-year-old &lt;a href="w%3ATokoroa"&gt;Tokoroa&lt;/a&gt; man has been arrested for the murder of a school teacher, Lois Dear. Dear's body was found on July 16 (Sunday) in her classroom at &lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20schools%20in%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Strathmore Primary School&lt;/a&gt;, one day before term three of the New Zealand primary school year was to start.

The accused murderer, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was arrested on Monday night at a camp and appeared in court today.

A large crowd of media personnel and onlookers gathered outside the packed courtroom. Twenty to thirty people had to remain outside. Many of the people who had gathered outside the courtroom abused the accused man as he walked to the courtroom. One said "You'll never make sentencing." Armed police also were deployed to protect the alleged murderer.

One person, who did not want to be named, said she "had come to let people know who had been arrested." She shouted the name out as the accused walked by.

The accused was remanded and is to appear back in court next week.

Murray Kendrick, principal of Strathmore Primary School, said that he "knew an arrest was imminent, and is relieved it has happened so quickly."

Police are not ruling out anyone else taking part in the murder.

On Sunday, &lt;a href="w%3AAzmi%20Bishara"&gt;Dr. Azmi Bishara&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href="w%3ABalad%20%28Israel%29"&gt;Balad&lt;/a&gt; Arab nationalist political party in Israel and member of the Israeli &lt;a href="w%3AKnesset"&gt;Knesset&lt;/a&gt; (Israeli Parliament) compared the current military actions by Israel unfavorably with similar previous conflicts in Lebanon.
In an article for the Arab Times Bishara said; "The only difference between today and the earlier bombardments — the 'Day of Reckoning' and &lt;a href="w%3AOperation%20Grapes%20of%20Wrath"&gt;'Grapes of Wrath'&lt;/a&gt; between 1993 and 1996 — is that Syrian forces are no longer present in Lebanon."

American Spencer Witt, who is filing daily reports from Lebanon, compared the difficulty average citizens are having today with those experienced during past operations; "Etienne was a freshman in high school during Operation Grapes of Wrath — 16 days of Israeli strikes that resulted in the destruction of Lebanese power plants and left much of the country in the dark. And now this." Witt said.

Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has said that the killing of 8 Israeli soldiers and the abduction of another two soldiers by Hezbollah militants on July 12 was an act of war; "The murderous attack this morning was not a terror attack but an act of war," Olmert said. Lebanon has Hezbollah members in its parliament and "must bear full responsibility. Israel's response will be restrained but very, very, very painful." Olmert said on July 12, 2006.

Olmert told Israeli legislators today that; "We want a two-kilometer (1.2-mile) space from the border in which it will not be possible to fire rockets toward soldiers and civilians houses and in which there will not be contact with military border patrols."

Israeli soldiers previously patrolled a "security zone" during Israel's 18-year occupation of south Lebanon. Olmert said today; "We do not have any intention of returning to the security zone but want to create an area where there will be no Hezbollah." and he repeated Israel's call for an international force (being referred to as "muscular" or "robust") to be put on the Israel-Lebanon border.

"We need international intervention forces that have military capabilities and ability to respond and enforce, and not forces similar to UNIFIL." he said, referring to U.N. peacekeepers. "I don't know when there will be a cease-fire. This is difficult, but we will stand up to this. ... We want to end the violent operation as quickly as possible but we won't end it before we believe we can achieve results that justify the price we have paid."

Dr. Bishara lambasted every aspect of Israel's position in this current conflict; "Any comparison between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's and Hezbollah chief Nasrallah's political rhetoric must conclude that the latter is the more rational. His speeches are more consistent with the facts and rely less than Olmert's on religious expressions and allusions...Israeli politicians have no cultural or moral edge over resistance leaders. The latter are far less attached to Iran than the former are to the US...The people who unleashed the brutal war against Lebanon are neither intelligent nor courageous. Quite the opposite; they are mediocrities, cowards and opportunists, but they happen to have military superiority. And they possess the keys to the machinery of a state, a real state, one that is secure in its identity, that has clear national security goals and channels of national mobilization, as opposed to a long deferred project for statehood and a states built on the fragmentation of national identity." 

Regarding the current conflict, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert told an Israeli parliament committee Wednesday that Israel would not reoccupy any part of southern Lebanon.

However, speaking on Israeli army radio, Justice Minister Haim Ramon - a close confidant of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert - said "everyone understands that a victory for Hezbollah is a victory for world terror". He said that in order to prevent casualties amongst Israeli soldiers battling Hezbollah militants in southern Lebanon, villages should be flattened by the Israeli air force before ground troops move in. 

"All those now in south Lebanon are terrorists who are related in some way to Hezbollah," Mr Ramon said.

Mr Ramon's call for the use of greater firepower came as the Israeli cabinet was set to decide whether to broaden its military offensive.

The director-general of the &lt;a href="World%20Trade%20Organisation"&gt;World Trade Organisation&lt;/a&gt; (WTO), &lt;a href="w%3APascal%20Lamy"&gt;Pascal Lamy&lt;/a&gt;, suspended negotiations in the &lt;a href="w%3ADoha%20round"&gt;Doha round&lt;/a&gt; of trade talks on Monday, after a meeting of six "core" negotiators &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Brazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Geneva"&gt;Geneva&lt;/a&gt; failed to make any headway in reconciling differences over agricultural trade liberalisation. The US wanted cuts in &lt;a href="w%3AImport%20tariff"&gt;import tariffs&lt;/a&gt; for farm products, which were rejected by EU, Japan and India, who asked for cuts in &lt;a href="w%3AAgricultural%20subsidy"&gt;agricultural subsidies&lt;/a&gt;. 

&lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Mandelson"&gt;Peter Mandelson&lt;/a&gt;, the EU trade commissioner, told the ♡❤Financial Times♡❤: "If the US continues to demand dollar-for-dollar compensation in market access [cutting tariffs] for reducing domestic support, no one in the developing world will ever buy that and the EU will not either." Brazil also identified the US stand on subsidies as the reason the talks failed. 

&lt;a href="w%3ASusan%20Schwab"&gt;Susan Schwab&lt;/a&gt;, the US trade representative, said that the other countries sought exemptions from tariff cuts for a wide range of goods and that such exemptions would defeat the object of the talks - to expand trade. "As we went through the layers of loopholes . . . we discovered that a couple of our trading partners were more interested in loopholes than market access," she said.

The Indian Commerce and Industries Minister, &lt;a href="w%3AKamal%20Nath"&gt;Kamal Nath&lt;/a&gt; said that developing countries could not allow their &lt;a href="w%3Asubsistence%20farming"&gt;subsistence farmers&lt;/a&gt; to lose their livelihood and &lt;a href="w%3Afood%20security"&gt;food security&lt;/a&gt; to provide market access to agricultural products from developed countries.

<h2>Many reasons attributed</h2>
The major agricultural exporters US, Australia and initially Brazil called for reductions in import tariffs on farm goods, saying that this will benefit the poor by reducing the price of food items and will expand markets for farmers everywhere. 
Developing countries such as India, &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="Philippines"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt;, which have millions of poor farmers, countered that cheap imports would drive the vulnerable farmers out of their livelihood. Their call for more tariff protection was also supported by developed nations in the EU and Japan, who also sought cuts on agricultural subsidies paid by the US to its farmers, saying that such subsidies distort prices and undercut their domestic producers unfairly. 

Officials involved in the negotiations told the ♡❤Financial Times♡❤ that there wasn't sufficient pressure by exporters either to overcome the &lt;a href="w%3Aprotectionist"&gt;protectionist&lt;/a&gt; lobby. The upcoming congressional elections in the US have been cited by some as one of the reasons the US is holding firm on not cutting subsidies further. The unpopularity of the talks in many developing nations has also been cited as a reason negotiators from such countries preferred the talks to fail. 

Peter Draper, a research fellow at the South African Institute of International Affairs told the South African ♡❤Business day♡❤, "The question is whether it is brinkmanship underpinned by major powers' negotiating tactics that has led to the breakdown or genuine irreconcilable differences. If it is the former, then the question will be for how long the negotiations will be suspended."

<h2>Reactions</h2>
&lt;a href="w%3AOxfam"&gt;Oxfam&lt;/a&gt;, the NGO working on aid and development, which had earlier supported the talks but later withdrew it after the subsidy-cuts it sought appeared to be unlikely, blamed the US and EU for not cutting subsidies while demanding developing countries to open their markets. Saying that any delay has "enormous costs", it called for the US and EU to make fundamental changes to their offers. 

The Congress of South African Trade Unions said the suspension of talks was an opportunity for developing nations to negotiate a better deal, adding that no-deal was better than the deal on the table.

The Australian National Farmers Federation expressed disappointment, saying that the suspension has cost Australian farmers $1.5 billion in potential new markets. 

The US Farm Bureau said that it was not prepared to give additional ground until Europe offers more concessions, and that farmers will now try to lock in subsidies. 

Among U.S. business groups, John J. Castellani, president of the Business Roundtable, an association of the chief executives of 160 of the biggest U.S. companies, said American negotiators were prepared to open markets if others did the same, and that Europe and other countries "surrendered to protectionist measures".

<h2>What ♡❤is♡❤ the Doha round?</h2>

The Doha "development" round of talks, named after Doha, the capital city of &lt;a href="Qatar"&gt;Qatar&lt;/a&gt;, where it was inaugurated in November 2001, focuses heavily on creating a fair system of trade for the benefit of developing countries, in particular for trade in agricultural products. 

Successive rounds of negotiations have failed to produce agreements on key issues such as cuts on subsidies and tariffs. In a ministerial meeting in &lt;a href="w%3ACancun"&gt;Cancun&lt;/a&gt; in 2003, developing countries, forming about two-thirds of the WTO members let the meetings fail rather than agreeing to a compromise. In 2004, the US came up with an offer to cut subsidies along with a demand that others cut tariffs. The previous two summits, the &lt;a href="w%3AGroup%20of%20Eight"&gt;Group of Eight&lt;/a&gt; nations, passed declarations expressing commitment to the talks and calling for a deal.

The congressional authority of the US President to negotiate an agreement on trade, the &lt;a href="w%3ATrade%20Promotion%20Authority"&gt;Trade Promotion Authority&lt;/a&gt;, expires by the middle of next year. The amount of work needed to complete an agreement before that meant that the end of this month was effectively a deadline for a framework agreement. 

<h3>Parallels to the Uruguay round</h3>
The previous &lt;a href="w%3AUruguay%20round"&gt;Uruguay round&lt;/a&gt; of talks were also suspended in 1990 after disagreements. The director-general of the WTO's forerunner, the &lt;a href="w%3AGeneral%20Agreement%20on%20Tariffs%20and%20Trade"&gt;General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade&lt;/a&gt; (GATT), Arthur Dunkel then worked with member nations to produce the Dunkel draft, which eventually lead to a final agreement in 1994.

<h2>Future of the Doha round</h2>
The suspended talks can only be revived by a consensus among the WTO's 149 members. The EU trading commissioner Peter Mandelson said that there were little short or medium term prospects of the talks restarting. Mark Vaile, Australian deputy prime minister and trade minister, said he would not accept superficial or partial reforms in the Doha round. The Indian Commerce and Industry Minister Kamal Nath that there was little ground for convergence on the core issues in the Doha round as of now. 

The US trade representative Susan Schwab said that she would push the Doha agenda in regional trade meetings and with individual countries. She also said that she did not expect to use the current TPA, which expires in mid-2007 to enact a Doha round agreement. The ♡❤Financial Times♡❤ reports that it is unlikely that the US Congress will renew the authority, again dimming prospects of a near-term agreement.

<h2>Repercussions of the failure</h2>
The WTO director-general, Pascal Lamy said the failure of the negotiations sent a "strong negative signal for the future of the world economy amidst the danger of a resurgence of protectionism".

The &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South African&lt;/a&gt; chief negotiator Xavier Carim called the failed talks a "serious setback" and pointed to the "huge" opportunity cost it implies, particularly for developing countries. A World Bank study in 2005 estimated that global free trade in agriculture would generate gains of US $287 billion, of which $86 billion will accrue to developing countries. 

Peter Mandelson, the EU trade commissioner said that formulating the EU trade policy going ahead will begin by the end of August. Australia and Japan have said that they will focus on bilateral and multilateral trade agreements. A Japanese foreign ministry official, speaking to the ♡❤Mainichi Daily News♡❤, and Hilton Zunckel, trade adviser to developing countries, speaking to ♡❤Business Day♡❤ said that many other WTO members would focus on bilateral and regional trade agreements.

A jewel that once belonged to &lt;a href="w%3ATutankhamen"&gt;King Tutankhamen&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3Aancient%20Egypt"&gt;ancient Egypt&lt;/a&gt; is believed to have been created by an exploding &lt;a href="w%3Ameteorite"&gt;meteorite&lt;/a&gt; entering Earth's atmosphere "hugely bigger in energy than the atomic [bomb] tests," said geophysicist John Wasson. The explosion was "Ten thousand times more powerful," added Wasson. 

The Egyptian Mineral Resources Authority says the jewel is composed of 98% silica or glass, making it the purest jewel of its kind on the planet and can only be found in a certain area of the &lt;a href="w%3ASahara"&gt;Sahara Desert&lt;/a&gt;.

Wasson also says the impact that created the jewel can be compared to the "&lt;a href="w%3ATunguska%20event"&gt;Tunguska event&lt;/a&gt;" that occurred in Tunguska, Siberia in 1908 causing at least 80 million trees to be flattened, but left no visible impact crater.

"When the thought came to me that it required a hot sky, I thought immediately of the Tunguska event," said Wasson.
The event was recreated by a computer simulation. The results of the simulation reveal that the impact of a meteorite or an event similar to Tunguska could have been the cause of the
formation and heating the ground up to nearly 1,800 degrees Celsius causing a thin layer of glass to form on the Earth's surface at the site of an impact.

Researchers also added that events like this are likely to happen at least every 100 years or so. Wasson says there are likely to be more impacts; it's "just a matter of when."

Until now over 12,000 MySpace.com users have signed on as “friends” of the Marine Corps whose profile, features streaming video of fresh recruits enduring boot camp and Marines storming beaches.

It underscores the growing significance of the Internet to advertisers as a means for reaching America’s youth. Recruiters say that they would never sign someone up to join the Marines unless they've met him or her in an old-fashioned, face-to-face meeting.

Joseph Dobbie, who is in his late 30s and lives in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABerkshire"&gt;Berkshire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , told Kate Winsall in the e-mail: "If I am twice as lucky as I dare to hope, you will find this note charming."

After reading the letter, Ms Winsall forwarded the email to her sister, who then sent it on to her friends. 

In the message, which contained five hundred and sixteen words, Mr Dobbie commented on how Ms Winsall's smile made "time stand still", going on to say this is the "freshest of my memories". He also said sorry for being drunk at the party the pair met, and he asked Ms Winsall out for a coffee at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATate%20Modern"&gt;Tate Modern&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Due to the email, Mr Dobbie has received hundreds of e-mails and phone calls from people as far away as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS"&gt;America&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . He has also revealed that he has changed his phone numbers as a result of the situation: "It got to the point where if I hung up either phone they would just ring again," he said. 

Mr Dobbie, who runs a web-design company, has said he wrote the note in the hope of meeting someone who would be thankful for such an effort. "My mother uses an expression 'it's cool to be cruel these days' and I just don't want that in my life," he said. 

He said Ms Winsall had been touched by the email, and she also apologised for its universal circulation. "I stood a chance with Kate. Now there’s no way she will say yes," Mr Dobbie said.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Red%20Cross%20ambulances%20hit%20by%20Israeli%20strike&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Six ambulance workers and their patients were wounded when &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israeli&lt;/a&gt; missiles struck &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Red%20Cross%20and%20Red%20Crescent%20Movement"&gt;Red Cross&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ambulances on a rescue mission in south &lt;a href="Lebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;. The attack took place near Qana when an ambulance from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATyre"&gt;Tyre&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; arrived intending to evacuate three patients from the border town of Tibnin. Two ambulances were completely destroyed as their roofs were pierced by missiles. According to one of the drivers, two guided missiles were fired at each ambulance. It is claimed that the ambulance headlamps were on, the blue light overhead was flashing, and another light illuminated the Red Cross flag at the time. 

The patients, the Fawaz family, all had minor injuries before the missiles struck the ambulance. Now the son is losing his leg and the other is treated for shrapnel wounds. 

The Lebanese Red Cross demanded that Israel guarantee their safety through the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; or the International Red Cross or they would cease all rescue missions. The South Lebanon ambulance service is run entirely by volunteers. This means that 100,000 people of the Tyre district, villages below the Litani river, would have no ambulance transport to reach hospital. 

Red Cross volunteer Mr Shaalan says although this is the first time ambulances have been hit by Israel in this war, it was only a matter of time. A lorry from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Arab%20Emirates"&gt;United Arab Emirates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; carrying medical supplies was hit in eastern Lebanon last week killing its driver and injured six Lebanese Red Cross workers. Yesterday afternoon the Red Cross office in Tyre trembled when two missiles landed in the building across the road.

An &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Australian"&gt;♡❤Australian♡❤&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; correspondent reports from the city of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATyre"&gt;Tyre&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that at least 10 Lebanese ambulances bearing the International Red Cross emblem have been targeted in Israeli air strikes in the south of Lebanon that have killed more than a dozen civilian passengers on transport to hospitals. 

An Israeli army spokesman said, “The incident in which vehicles were hit last night occurred in an area known to be one of the main sources of the launching of hundreds of missiles.” 
The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement said it had set up two southern bases, in the port of Tyre and the town of Marjayoun further east.

&lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; – 
The preliminary hearing for a lawsuit against the Elmwood Village Hotel proposal has been pushed back to August 10, 2006.

The hotel would require the demolition of at least five properties owned by Hans Mobius, 1109-1121 Elmwood and would cause the closure of several businesses. Already, two businesses, Skunk Tail Glass and Six Nations Native American Gift Shop have relocated, outside the Elmwood Strip. Don apparel, H.O.D. Tattoo and Mondo Video still remain on Elmwood; however, Mondo Video is planning on moving to a new location. The hotel will be 72 rooms and will cost at least 7 million dollars to build. Savarino Construction Services Corporation would be in charge of building the hotel and Wyndham Hotels would operate it.

Attorney Arthur Giacalone says that the court date was pushed back because "the court apparently felt it did not make sense to proceed with oral argument on 7/27 if Savarino is going to re-start the process." Giacalone also stated that the decision to adjourn until August 10 "was not my idea." On July 13, 2006 Savarino announced that they were withdrawing the proposal to "resubmit" it to "shed the lawsuits" against the proposal.

Savarino was allegedly supposed to resubmit the proposal by the end of last week but so far has not done so. The final meeting of Buffalo's Common Council for the summer occurred today. The Council will not meet again until September.
"If they [Savarino] took no action today, re the hotel, [that is, accepting the new application, or rescinding the prior rezoning resolution], nothing official will happen for the next 6 weeks or so," added Giacalone also saying that if this is the case, "the court may not be willing to hear oral argument on 8/10 since we will still be up in the air about what’s going on." Giacalone also states that he is unsure about "what they [the Common Council] did today."

Despite the call for a "do-over" of the proposals process, Giacalone still states that his client's position of the "pending lawsuit will not be 'moot' or 'academic' unless and until the Common Council rescinds its prior vote(s) that approved the rezoning" for the buildings on Elmwood and one property on Forest Avenues.

Sam Savarino, CEO of Savarino Construction has been contacted, but has not replied to any e-mails. Area councilman Joseph Golombeck has also been e-mailed, but also has not replied.

<h1>Scandal Appeals see Lazio and Fiorentine reinstated back into Serie A</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Scandal%20Appeals%20see%20Lazio%20and%20Fiorentine%20reinstated%20back%20into%20Serie%20A&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The results of the appeals in the massive &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="association%20football"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; match-fixing scandal have today been announced by the Italian federal court. All four clubs involved saw their original punishments reduced.

&lt;a href="Juventus%20FC"&gt;Juventus&lt;/a&gt; originally were relegated to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASerie%20B"&gt;Serie B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with a thirty-point deduction. Their appeal still sees them in Italian football's second division, but with their points deduction almost halved to seventeen. They will still have their last two &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AScudetto"&gt;Scudettos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; stripped off them and the 2005-06 title will not be assigned to anyone. They will also have to play three games behind closed doors.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAC%20Milan"&gt;AC Milan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; will remain in &lt;a href="Serie%20A"&gt;Serie A&lt;/a&gt; and with their points deduction reduced from fifteen to just eight. They will play one match behind closed doors. However, importantly, they have been reinstated into the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUEFA%20Champions%20League"&gt;Champions League&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , but will have to play in the third qualifying round.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFiorentina"&gt;Fiorentina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AS.S.%20Lazio"&gt;Lazio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have been reinstated into Serie A, having been demoted into Serie B originally. However, both clubs have had their points deductions increased, in Fiorentina's case the deduction was twelve points and Lazio will start the season with -11 points having originally had a seven-point penalty. Both clubs will not be allowed to play in European competitions next season and will have stadium bans. Fiorentina must play three games behind closed doors and for Lazio it's two.

<h2>Other consequences</h2>
The appeals mean that of the original relegated trio, only &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Lecce"&gt;Lecce&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATreviso%20F.B.C.%201993"&gt;Treviso&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have actually gone down, with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AF.C.%20Messina%20Peloro"&gt;Messina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; staying up to make way for Juve's demotion.

The European qualifying places have now been reworked. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternazionale%20Milano%20F.C."&gt;Internazionale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AA.S.%20Roma"&gt;Roma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; will compete in the UEFA Champions League group stages, while &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AA.C.%20ChievoVerona"&gt;Chievo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; will join AC Milan in the third qualifying round. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Citt%C3%A0%20di%20Palermo"&gt;Palermo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AA.S.%20Livorno%20Calcio"&gt;Livorno&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AParma%20F.C."&gt;Parma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; will be in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUEFA%20Cup"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; next season.

<h2>Reactions</h2>
Juventus have stated that they willnot accept their fate and will now try to re-appeal, possibly via civil courts. Chairman Giovanni Cobolli Gigli said in a statement: ""We absolutely cannot accept this sentence. For this reason we have decided to push our case in every possible forum." 

Fiorentina could also appeal via the civil courts and owner Diego Della Valle stated: "It's the first step. We haven't done anything and we will go down every avenue to clear our name." 

Lazio chairman Claudio Lotito was also angry despite his club being restored into Serie A. He said: "I'm not satisfied at all. Lazio has not broken any rule. The fact that we will not be taking part in the Uefa Cup is not in line with the truth."

AC Milan were the only club to show any form of relief at their punishment being reduced. "For a club that asked for a complete annulment (of the tribunal's sentence) it cannot be considered a victory," said their lawyer Leandro Cantamessa. 

"But bearing in mind the tribunal's sentence, which was like being in front of a firing squad, this is much better." After being asked if the club would, like the other three, re-appeal in the civil course, he replied: "I don't know. We'll see. We are in the Champions League, otherwise I would not even be moderately happy".

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Toll%20to%20cancel%20Overlander%20train%20service&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Island%20Main%20Trunk"&gt;North Island Main Trunk&lt;/a&gt; line has been used in &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; for passenger services for 97 years, beginning in 1909.

Toll said it had been running the train service at a loss for many years now and was no longer viable to continue running the service. They also say that they approached the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Government"&gt;New Zealand Government&lt;/a&gt; for help so they could continue the Overlander but "after working through with the Government both parties concluded there was not the passenger numbers to justify keeping it running. Significant investment would also have been required to replace the aging carriage fleet," David Jackson, Chief Executive of Toll New Zealand, said.

Only 50,000 people used the train each year compared to the 200,000 people who use the Tranz Alpine in the &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Island"&gt;South Island&lt;/a&gt;.

It was cheaper and shorter to catch a plane, between &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20dollar"&gt;NZ$&lt;/a&gt;100-$282 for an one-hour flight, compared to $158-$170 for a 12-hour journey.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Green%20Party"&gt;New Zealand Green Party&lt;/a&gt; is disappointed by the news. Co-leader of Greens, &lt;a href="w%3AJeanette%20Fitzsimons"&gt;Jeanette Fitzsimons&lt;/a&gt;, said "I predict that as oil prices continue to rise further we will need The Overlander again."

Yesterday, a group of scientists from the U.S. and Canada, headed by O.H. Kantarci from the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AMayo%20Clinic"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARochester%2C%20Minnesota"&gt;Rochester, Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;, published an article in the professional journal ♡❤Neurology♡❤ on the transmission of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AMultiple%20sclerosis"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (MS). The result of their studies is that the disease is transmitted to children more often when the father is the one having the disease.

In their studies, 441 children were examined whose fathers or mothers had MS, 45 of which were ill themselves. While only in 27 out of 323 cases, mothers transmitted the disease to their children - which makes 8,36 percent of the cases -, children of fathers with MS inherited it in 18 out of 117 cases - i.e. in 15,38 percent of the cases.
MS is an illness caused by the immune system destroying nerves between the brain and the spinal cord. Later disorders consist of paralysis, speech disorders, impaired visions and problems in motion. Researchers found that MS is not a classical hereditary disease, but is caused by a number of genetic and outer impacts. Also, it is likely that several genes (with complex interactions) have an influence on the development of the disease.

The actual reasons for people to suffer from MS are still unknown. But what is known is that it occurs approximately twice as much in women than in men. And this could be the reason for fathers transmitting the disease to their children more often than mothers. The group thinks that men who are actually ill are carrying more genetic material causing the illness than women with MS which leads to a higher probability for their children to also have MS. This is known as the "Carter effect" in medicine.

<h1>Power and water return to Liberia</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Power%20and%20water%20return%20to%20Liberia&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3A%20Liberia"&gt;Liberian&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="w%3A%20Ellen%20sirleaf-johnson"&gt;Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf&lt;/a&gt; today flicked a switch to restore electricity to the country’s war torn capital, &lt;a href="w%3A%20Monrovia"&gt;Monrovia&lt;/a&gt;, after a gap of over 15 years.

At a ceremony to coincide with the 159th anniversary of the country’s independence, Mrs. Sirleaf-Johnson, who was elected at the end of 2005, pulled a switch draped in the Liberian flag illuminating a suburban clinic in the city. 

"The switching on today is symbolic. It symbolises our journey from darkness to illumination," President Johnson-Sirleaf said in a speech.

She was joined by the &lt;a href="w%3AGhana"&gt;Ghanaian&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="w%3A%20John%20Kuffour"&gt;John Kuffour&lt;/a&gt; who said “…with the restoration of power to Liberia the period of gloom and darkness engendered by political turmoil must come to an end." Ghana provided equipment and manpower to assemble Monrovia’s electricity infrastructure after it was largely looted by soldiers during the decade of turmoil in the country. 

Pumped water was also restored to the capital at a ceremony on Tuesday, which the &lt;a href="w%3A%20World%20Health%20Organisation"&gt;World Health Organisation&lt;/a&gt; has declared high quality. These two major milestones demonstrate visible progress to the Liberian people that the country is making progress, and will add optimism during the anniversary celebrations. 

"My last daughter does not even know what a &lt;a href="w%3Astreet%20light"&gt;street light&lt;/a&gt; is. When she saw it she did not want to leave," one 45 year old Monrovian told &lt;a href="w%3A%20Reuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;. 

After becoming Africa’s first female head of state, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf promised to restore power and water to the capital within 150 days, a target she has just reached. But after decades of poor leadership, the country still lacks good roads and a working telephone network. 

Liberia spent the entirety of the 1990s fighting one of the most brutal &lt;a href="w%3A%20Liberian%20Civil%20War"&gt;civil wars&lt;/a&gt; of modern &lt;a href="w%3A%20Africa"&gt;African history&lt;/a&gt;. Around 250,000 people were killed under the rule of &lt;a href="w%3A%20Charles%20Taylor"&gt;Charles Taylor&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href="w%3A%20National%20Patriotic%20Front%20of%20Liberia"&gt;National Patriotic Front&lt;/a&gt; which took power in 1989. After fleeing in 2003 Taylor has since been arrested and awaits trial in the &lt;a href="w%3A%20International%20Criminal%20Court"&gt;Hague&lt;/a&gt;, Netherlands. 

But since the peace was signed in 2003 serious efforts have been made to improve the country’s facilities. The country currently holds one of the largest &lt;a href="w%3A%20United%20Nations"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; peacekeeping forces of 15,000 soldiers.

The Dubliner, a famous &lt;a href="w%3AIreland"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt; pub in the &lt;a href="w%3ADigbeth"&gt;Digbeth&lt;/a&gt; area of &lt;a href="w%3ABirmingham"&gt;Birmingham&lt;/a&gt;, has been destroyed by a fire that was started around 4.30am on the 26th July 2006, apparently deliberately.

Reports indicate between 100 and 120 firefighters were tackling the blaze at its height. There was also an explosion reported at the site.

12 people were staying overnight at the pub, all of them managed to escape the fire, although one man had to be treated for smoke inhalation.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Despite%206%20warnings%20Israel%20bombed%20and%20killed%204%20UN%20observers&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

An Israeli bombardment killed four United Nations Observers, despite multiple warnings by UN peacekeeper. The peacekeepers at the post said the area within a kilometer of the post was hit with precision munitions, including 17 bombs and 12 artillery shells, four of which directly hit the UN observation post. The fatal strike with a "precision-guided weapon" according to UN military personnel hit the post at about 7.20pm. The victims were Austrian, Canadian, Chinese and Finnish UN-observers.

The Irish foreign ministry said that Israel ignored repeated warnings from Lieutenant-Colonel John Molloy, a key UN liaising officer, that its bombs were falling close to United Nations observers in southern Lebanon. The warnings came allegedly before an Israeli bomb killed four of the U.N. observers. "On six separate occasions he [Lieutenant-Colonel John Molloy] was in contact with the Israelis to warn them that their bombardment was endangering the lives of UN staff in South Lebanon". "He warned: 'You have to address this problem or lives may be lost'," an Irish foreign affairs spokesman said. 

Suzanne Coogan, a spokeswoman for the Irish Defence Minister Willie O'Dea said Molloy "warned the Israelis that they were shelling in very close proximity to the post, and his warnings were very specific, explicit, detailed and stark." She concluded, "Obviously those warnings went unheeded."

Irish Foreign Minister Dermot Ahern said "Evidence that we have would suggest that this was either an incredible accident or else was in some way directly targeted".

In 1996 over 100 civilians were killed by the Israeli bombing of a UN compound in Lebanon in an incident known as the &lt;a href="w%3AQana%20shelling"&gt;Qana shelling&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>The United Nations</h2>

Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, said "I am shocked and deeply distressed by the apparently deliberate targeting by Israeli Defense Forces of a United Nations observer post in southern Lebanon that has killed two United Nations military observers, with two more feared dead." 

Kofi Annan also said "This coordinated artillery and aerial attack on a long established and clearly marked U.N. post at Khiyam occurred despite personal assurances given to me by Prime Minister Ehud Olmert that U.N. positions would be spared Israeli fire."

According to an press release there were 14 prior incidents of firing close to this position by aerial bombs and artillery shells before the fatal hit occurred. Also, 9 UNIFIL bases were bombed earlier during this war but with no apparent casualties. It was also reported &lt;a href="Hezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt; fired "from the vicinity" of United Nations positions in Alma ash Shab, Tibnin, Brashit, At Tiri.

<h2>China</h2>

Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said "China urges the sides concerned, especially Israel, to take tangible measures to ensure the security of UN peacekeepers" .

Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister Zhai Jun told Israeli Ambassador Yehoyada Haim "China strongly condemns the activity to raid the UN peacekeeping post and urges Israel to carry out a thorough investigation and apologize to China and the victim's families, and coordinate with China to deal with the aftermath".

The Chinese victim, named Du Zhaoyu, was a Lieutenant Colonel of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. He has been in Lebanon as a UN observer since January.

<h2>Finland</h2>

Finnish President Tarja Halonen wanted a full investigation of the attack and also said there was no justification for an attack on the U.N. post.

Finnish Foreign Minister Erkki Tuomioja said "It is not the first time that they (U.N. peace keepers) have been attacked, but it is the first time they have been killed." Mr Tuomioja continued "These so called precision attacks seem to be hitting everyone except Hezbollah, there have been hundreds of civilians, international workers and others killed already and it does not seem that by these means a military solution could be achieved."

The Finnish victim was Lieutenant-Commander Jarno Mäkinen from Kaarina. He was 29 years old and joined United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation (UNTSO) in November 2005. Before that training officer and unit commander in the Uusimaa Brigade.

<h2>Canada</h2>

Prime Minister Stephen Harper says Israel's deadly attack on a UN observation post in Lebanon was a "terrible tragedy". He doubts that the bombing was deliberate. "I certainly doubt that to be the case, given that the government of Israel has been co-operating with us in our evacuation efforts" "We want to find out why this United Nations post was attacked and also why it remained manned during what is now, more or less, a war during obvious danger to these individuals."

Mr Harper said he was waiting for a call from Olmert. "I expect that he will be expressing his deep regret. But also I'll be asking for his full co-operation in getting to the bottom of this." He also said he would follow the results of the UN and Israeli investigation rather than launching his own.

The Canadian victim is Major Paeta Hess-von Kruedener, a member of the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry. He had completed nine months of his one-year assignment with the UN in Lebanon.

On July 18, Major Paeta Hess-von Kruedener provided CTV.ca with an update of his mission via e-mail.
He said that there had been numerous occasions when his post had come under fire. "What I can tell you is this: we have on a daily basis had numerous occasions where our position has come under direct or indirect fire from both artillery and aerial bombing," 

"The closest artillery has landed within two meters of our position and the closest 1000 lb aerial bomb has landed 100 meters from our patrol base." Retired Canadian Major General Lewis Mackenzie was interviewed on CBC radio, and told of an e-mail letter from Kruedener. "He was telling us that Hezbollah soldiers were all over his position and the IDF were targeting them. Since Hezbollah don't have representation in the UN, they use the UN as shields knowing that they can't be punished for it."

<h2>Austria</h2>

A statement from Austria foreign ministry issued by foreign minister Ursula Plassnik said "Such an attack on unarmed UN observers is entirely unacceptable and can in no way be justified" Ursula Plassnik expressed Austria's indignation over the attack and demanded an immediate and thorough investigation into the incident.

<h1>Saddam Hussein 'forced' back to trial</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Saddam%20Hussein%20%27forced%27%20back%20to%20trial&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="Saddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt;, who had been on &lt;a href="hunger%20strike"&gt;hunger strike&lt;/a&gt;, has said in his trial today that he was taken to court from his hospital bed against his will. 

The former leader of &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; was rushed to hospital last Sunday after refusing to eat for sixteen days. But according to news agencies, he has ended the hunger strike by eating lunch at the court in &lt;a href="Baghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;. "Saddam ate beef and rice and cola with bread which he brought from hospital," one source told &lt;a href="Reuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt; news agency. He was fasting with three co-defendants, and they were demanding more security for their defence lawyers, three of whom have been murdered. 

While Hussein was being treated by doctors in hospital on Monday, the trial recommenced without him. But today, he appeared in front of the court, looking slightly thinner. "I was brought against my will directly from the hospital… the Americans insisted that I come against will. This is not fair," he claimed. "Three days ago I was taken to hospital and today I was brought here forcibly from the hospital. I was fed intravenously."

He also said later on in the hearing that if he was found guilty and faced execution, he would prefer to be shot rather than hanged. "I advise you as an Iraqi, if you were in a circumstance in which you have to issue a death penalty, you have to remember that Saddam is a military man and in this case the verdict should be death by shooting not by hanging."

As his defence team has been boycotting the trial, replacement lawyers have been selected by the court. However, Hussein has dismissed the representatives brought in to defend him. "Your honour, I refuse to appear before this tribunal, but this tribunal can do as it wills," he added. 

In response, Judge Abdel Rahman said: "Your lawyers were informed of the hearing and they chose not to come, despite the fact they have billions of dollars and sit in a neighbouring country, where they incite violence." Most of Hussein’s legal team is based in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAmman"&gt;Amman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the capital of &lt;a href="Jordan"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt;. 

Saddam Hussein and seven co-defendants are on trial charged with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acrimes%20against%20humanity"&gt;crimes against humanity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; after Hussein allegedly ordered his military forces to kill 148 people from the village of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADujail"&gt;Dujail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; following an attempted assassination of the former dictator in 1982.
