The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Atop%20kill"&gt;top kill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; procedure &lt;a href="New%20BP%20oil%20spill%20plan"&gt;implemented by BP&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="Deepwater%20Horizon%20drilling%20rig%20explosion"&gt;leaking Deepwater Horizon oil well&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday has failed. According to David Suttles, BP's chief operating officer, "We have been unable to overcome the flow." Suttles stated that after studying three days of results, BP determined that the procedure was a failure.

On Wednesday, BP began pumping mud into the leaking well, a procedure known as top kill. BP chief executive Tony Howard said it would take at least 24 hours to determine if the procedure was successful. The procedure has worked before in surface situations, but was not previously attempted at 5,000 feet underwater.
The procedure involves pumping heavyweight drilling mud from the surface through a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Adrill%20pipe"&gt;drill pipe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which directs the mud into a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AManifold%20%28general%20engineering%29"&gt;manifold&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; lying on the sea bed. From the manifold, the mud is pumped into the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ablowout%20preventer"&gt;blowout preventer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which is sitting on the well.

BP says it pumped 30,000 barrels of mud into the well at rates of up to 80 barrels a minute. After three attempts, the well was still leaking. 

The next option, the sixth, is called the Lower Marine Riser Package (LMRP) Cap containment system. This procedure involves a &lt;a href="Remotely%20operated%20underwater%20vehicle"&gt;ROV&lt;/a&gt; using a saw to cut off the leaking pipe and place a cap on the pipe. The LMRP Cap is at the scene and the procedure is expected to take four days to complete.

In &lt;a href="New%20Orleans"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt; hundreds gathered in protest, calling for a fast stop to the spill and greater efforts to mitigate its ecological and economic effects.

<h2>Script</h2>
<h3>&lt;a href="Attack%20occurs%20in%20Stavropol%2C%20Russia%3B%20at%20least%20six%20dead"&gt;Attack occurs in Stavropol, Russia; at least six dead&lt;/a&gt; (0:40)</h3>

A radio-controlled bomb exploded in the city center in the southern Russian city of Stavropol earlier today, killing at least six and injuring more than 40, according to initial reports.

The explosion occurred at 6:45pm Moscow time in front of the Stavropol Trade-Union Sport and Culture Palace as a performance by Chechen dance ensemble "Vainakh" was about to begin. Security officials haven't dismissed a possible connection between the concert and the attack.

According to Boris Skripka, the head of the civilian defense and emergency situation administration, "several of those that were hospitalized are now in intensive care. The wounded have shrapnel wounds. Their conditions are considered critical or medium-critical".

Stavropol is included in the newly-created North Caucasian Federal District of Russia and the country has seen violence from rebel groups recently: on March 29, suicide bombings at the Moscow Metro killed at least 40 people and wounded over 100. 

<h3>(1:41)</h3>

Authorities in Jamaica say that gunfights in the capital Kingston have left at least 30 people dead, as hundreds of troops and police search for an alleged drug kingpin wanted by the US. At least 25 people were injured as well.

The violence has been triggered by the Jamaican government's efforts to extradite Christopher "Dudus" Coke, the alleged leader of the "Shower Posse" group. Armed security forces stormed the Tivoli Gardens slum of western Kingston on Monday in an effort to locate Coke, who has not been found. Last week, Coke's supporters barricaded the area in an attempt to thwart his arrest.

The trouble has forced the closure of schools and businesses across the capital, and the government has appealed for blood donations for the wounded. A state of emergency is in effect for parts of Kingston.

The US has issued a travel alert to warn citizens against visiting the island nation. Jamaican Prime Minister Bruce Golding has promised "strong and decisive" action to restore order.

<h3>&lt;a href="Plane%20crashes%20into%20Toronto%20office%20building"&gt;Plane crashes into Toronto office building&lt;/a&gt; (2:42)</h3>

A Cirrus SR-20 single engine aircraft crashed into an office building in Markham, a town near Toronto, at 12:30 p.m. local time yesterday. Both people on board were killed.

The aircraft, which crashed into the roof of the two-story building at Woodbine and Hooper streets, was engulfed in flames. Witnesses say that it looked as if the pilot was trying to find somewhere to land and that the aircraft was trailing smoke and rolled before it crashed.

First reports state that the pilot and passenger were killed on impact, however the 14 employees at Thinkway Toys manufacturing escaped the two-story building and explosions from the crash.

The crash site is near Buttonville airport where many amateur and flight training courses occur.

<h3>&lt;a href="UK%20police%20announce%20arrest%20of%20suspected%20serial%20killer"&gt;UK police announce arrest of suspected serial killer&lt;/a&gt; (3:30)</h3>

Police in the United Kingdom have arrested a 40-year-old man on suspicion of being a serial killer. The man is being questioned over the death of one prostitute and the disappearances of two others in Bradford, West Yorkshire, England.

The man was arrested on Monday after 36-year-old Suzanne Blamires vanished on Sunday. Body parts believed to be hers were found floating in the River Aire in nearby Shipley by a member of public at 2:00 p.m. yesterday afternoon. 

The man, who lives in Bradford's red-light district, is also facing questioning over the April 26 disappearance of Shelley Armitage, 31, and the June 2009 disappearance of Susan Rushworth, 43. This morning a magistrate granted West Yorkshire Police extra time to question the man, which will expire tomorrow evening.

Rushworth was last seen on a double-decker bus heading to Thornton Road. She had three children, was addicted to heroin and suffered from epilepsy. Armitage was last seen on CCTV in the red-light district. She lived just three streets from Blamires and the two knew each other. 

The area is being examined by forensics experts, crime officers and police divers. West Yorksire Police's homicide and major enquiries team is conducting the investigation. Police dogs have been used to search a drainage culvert and undergrowth on Thornton Road, and black bags from skips behind nearby halls of residence have been examined. Members of the police underwater search unit were also at work. Previously, separate searches have been held for Rushworth and Armitage.

Assistant Chief Constable Jawaid Akhtar said the remains from the river are of a single unidentified woman. He said that all three woman's families are being assisted by family liaison officers. Speaking at an on-scene press conference at the junction between Dockfield Road and Otley Road in Shipley, he described the investigation as "a very thorough and painstaking inquiry into three missing women, all of them sex workers, with all the necessary resources and expertise devoted to it."

Some British media has compared the case to the serial killer Peter Sutcliffe, often referred to as the Yorkshire Ripper. Sutcliffe lived in Bradford and killed three of his thirteen victims there; he also attempted to murder seven more people before his 1981 conviction. Most of his victims were prostitutes.

<h3>&lt;a href="Oil%20spill%20in%20Alaska%20closes%20800%20miles%20of%20pipeline"&gt;Oil spill in Alaska closes 800 miles of pipeline&lt;/a&gt; (5:56)</h3>

800 miles of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System were closed down following a spill of thousands of barrels of crude oil south of Fairbanks, Alaska. A power failure following a routine fire-command system test caused relief valves to open and crude oil overflowed near Fort Greely pump station 9.

The valves opening allowed a pressure release for the system and oil flowed on a pad to a tank that can hold 2.3 million gallons. As of Wednesday afternoon, the tank vents were still leaking probably from thermal expansion inside the tank. Another secondary containment area below the tanks capable of holding 104,500 barrels was not yet filled to capacity.

The spill coordinator for the Department of Environmental Conservation, Tom DeRuter, said that the oil spill contamination should be confined to the graveled oil containment liner. DeRuter explained that "Safety is their No. 1 objective right now."

40 people had been evacuated from the Fort Greely site, and the Prudhoe Bay station has been reduced by 84%. "We're going to take as long as we need to make sure the site is safe before we start back up," said Alyeska Pipeline Service Company spokesperson Michele Egan. There is capacity in reserve tanks for 48 hours during this slow down of production.

About 650,000 barrels per day run through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline between Prudhoe Bay to the Port of Valdez oil tankers. The majority of shares in Alyeska are held by BP Exploration, Alaska (BPXA) which is also currently addressing the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.

BP addressed a 267,000 gallon crude oil spill in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska in 2006 resulting in a lawsuit against BP Exploration.

<h3>&lt;a href="Oil%20spilled%20after%20ships%20collide%20in%20Singapore"&gt;Oil spilled after ships collide in Singapore&lt;/a&gt; (7:48)</h3>

Around 2500 tonnes of oil were spilled into the Strait of Singapore yesterday after two ships collided.

The two ships involved in the collision were the oil tanker MT Bunga Kelana 3 and the bulk ship MV Wally, which collided around thirteen kilometers south of Singapore. The tanker received an estimated ten meter gash on its left side, while the bulk ship sustained only minor damage. After the incident, both ships moved away from the spill and are now anchored.

The oil slick has moved north, and is now now encompassing an estimated four square kilometers around six kilometers south of Singapore. Emergency teams from both Singapore and Malaysia have been mobilized, and around twenty vessels are taking part in the clean-up operations. Both containment booms and chemical dispersant are being used to clean up the oil.

The spill is not expected to have any major effects on shipping; Victor Shum, an official from a consulting firm in Singapore, said that "[i]f it is contained within an oil retaining booms, it may not disrupt shipping traffic." Shum also expressed environmental concerns, saying that "certainly the concerns are there. Even if it is contained, it will take some time to clean up."

<h3>&lt;a href="Iraqi%20Airways%20drops%20flights%20to%20United%20Kingdom%20and%20Sweden"&gt;Iraqi Airways drops flights to United Kingdom and Sweden&lt;/a&gt; (9:02)</h3>

Iraqi Airways have announced that they are to drop all flights to the United Kingdom and Sweden. The announcement comes after a row with Kuwait over war reparations.

Iraq and Kuwait are in dispute over billions of dollars of reparations; this includes around $1.2bn in aircraft and parts seized beginning in 1990 by Saddam Hussein. The airline's director general was stranded in the United Kingdom on the basis of a High Court court order obtained by Kuwait Airways last month, but his passport was returned and he was allowed to leave after he informed the court of all the airline's assets in the UK.

Amer Abdul-Jabbar, the Iraqi Transport Minister released a statement saying that "We will announce whether or not we will dissolve the company." The cancellations were announced by the director general of Iraqi Airways, Kifah Jabar Hassan.

Hassan spoke about the plans to dissolve the company, saying that "[w]e can establish another airline company and put an end to this case. With this, the Kuwaitis will get nothing”.

On April 25th, Iraqi Airways sent its first jet to the United Kingdom in twenty years. The flight had been delayed for over a year and was met with further restrictions for nine days after the volcanic ash crisis in Europe. The aircraft was impounded by London High Court and no further flights to the UK have been made.

<h3>&lt;a href="Irish%20Senator%20Kieran%20Phelan%20dies%20at%20age%2060"&gt;Irish Senator Kieran Phelan dies at age 60&lt;/a&gt; (10:27)</h3>

Irish Senator Kieran Phelan has died suddenly at the age of 60. Phelan died after falling ill in his hotel in Dublin this morning, shortly before a meeting due to be held by the upper house of the Irish parliament.

Phelan, who was a member of the Fianna Fáil party, sat on the Industrial and Commercial Panel and had been a Senator since 2002. He was also a Laois County councilor and was elected council chairman in 1998.

As a mark of respect, Leader of the House Donie Cassidy proposed that the house be adjourned until June 1st.

<h3>&lt;a href="Mexican%20cartoonist%20Gabriel%20Vargas%20dies%20at%2095"&gt;Mexican cartoonist Gabriel Vargas dies at 95&lt;/a&gt; (11:03)</h3>

One of Mexico’s most successful cartoonists, Gabriel Vargas, died yesterday at the age of 95. His death was announced by the National Council of the Arts and Culture. Vargas had been ill for several years before his death, but no cause of death has yet been given.

Vargas’s most successful comic strip was “La Familia Burron” which he started in 1937. The strip looked at a low-income family struggling with everyday life. It sold up to 500,000 copies per week until the 1970s.

Later in his career he won several awards for his work, including Mexico’s National Journalism Prize in 1983 and the National Sciences and Arts prize in 2003.

There was a memorial viewing for Vargas at a funeral home in Mexico City yesterday.

<h3>&lt;a href="Rollover%20on%20Illinois%20Route%2059%20in%20Naperville%20injures%20one"&gt;Rollover on Illinois Route 59 in Naperville injures one&lt;/a&gt; (11:51)</h3>

A motorist was injured during a collision that resulted in a rollover in the city of Naperville, Illinois, United States. The accident occurred at about 8:15 am (13:15 UTC) on the interchange of Illinois Route 59 and Interstate 88.

Naperville police reported that Pavitra Durgam, a 26-year-old from Chicago, was traveling southbound on Route 59 and tried to turn left onto the ramp to Interstate 88. In doing so, she cut in front of a car heading north on Route 59. The other, currently unidentified driver swerved to avoid her, hit a curb, and collided with her car anyway. 

Northbound traffic on Route 59 north of Diehl Road, including the entrance into eastbound Interstate 88, was blocked as crews cleaned up the area of the collision. The unidentified motorist complained of back pain and was thus sent to nearby Edward Hospital. Durgam received a citation for failing to yield to oncoming traffic as she turned. 

<h3>&lt;a href="Turkish%20shopkeeper%20saves%20falling%20toddler"&gt;Turkish shopkeeper saves falling toddler&lt;/a&gt; (12:51)</h3>

A four year old Istanbul toddler was saved from serious injury by quick-thinking shopkeeper Ali Arapi, who caught the boy as he fell the thirteen feet from the floor above. CCTV security cameras caught images of both the child riding on the outside of the escalator and Ali Apari's sure-handed catch.

Noticing that the child was dangling from the handrail Apari ran below the boy as the four year old neared the railing at the top of the shopping center escalator. As the boy fell, Apari positioned himself to catch the toddler as he fell off eight feet above him.

Arapi said later, “Children believe the escalators are playgrounds, the families are irresponsible. The families should take better care of their children.” Arapi had just had a brain operation a month before this incident, and Arapi could have been badly injured himself, if the child had hit his head instead of his arms.

However this is not the first incident of a child falling from riding an escalator at the shopping mall. Four days earlier in imitation of older children, a two-year old had to be rushed to hospital after falling from halfway up the escalator. After these falls the shopping mall has attempted to thwart attempts to ride the outside of the escalators by impeding access with flower pots. In 2006 a sixteen-year old and a three-year old died falling from escalators in Turkey.

<h3>&lt;a href="Volunteers%20collaborate%20in%20reconstruction%20of%20Lolol%2C%20Chile"&gt;Volunteers collaborate in reconstruction of Lolol, Chile&lt;/a&gt; (14:14)</h3>

Over this past Sunday, which was the day of National Monuments of Chile, a group of volunteers from Santiago traveled to Lolol, a town located in the O'Higgins Region. Lolol, named National Monument of Chile in October 2003, was severely damaged after the major February earthquake; the Church of the town, widely known as one of the oldest in Chile, is currently being restored.

Previously, 35 students of Tourism in the Technical Formation Center of the Los Leones Institute, were working in Lolol between April 30 and May 1, helping to clean up the damage caused by the earthquake.

The famous musical group, Bafona, also visited Lolol, as well as a few other towns that were damaged by the earthquake.

Executive Clerk of the National Monuments Council of Chile, Óscar Acuña, said of the volunteers that "Their attitude is a clear sample of the conscience and love of the Chileans with their legacy and patrimony, especially after the earthquake,"

In 1647, Alse Young became the first person executed for witchcraft in America's original thirteen colonies in the state of Connecticut.

Very little is recorded of Alse Young; her existence is only known through her reputation as a witch. She is believed to have been the wife of John Young, who bought a small parcel of land in Windsor in 1641, sold it in 1649, and then disappeared from the town records. She had a daughter, Alice Young Beamon, who, sadly, would also be accused of witchcraft in nearby Springfield, Massachusetts, some 30 years later. 

Like many similar cases of witchcraft, Alse Young was a woman without a son when the accusation was lodged, which implied that she would be eligible to receive through inheritance her husband's estate. Historical record hints at the possibility that there may have also been some sort of epidemic in the town of Windsor in early 1647.

Alse Young was hanged at the Meeting House Square in Hartford, Connecticut, on what is now the site of the Old State House and the second town clerk of Windsor, Matthew Grant, recorded the execution with a May 26, 1647 diary entry, stating simply "Alse Young was hanged."

Witchcraft became punishable by death in the Connecticut Colony in 1642, and this capital offense was backed by references to the King James version of the Bible: Exodus (22:18) saying, "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live" and Leviticus (20:27) stating, "A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with stones: their blood (shall be) upon them." 

In Connecticut, the crime of witchcraft was listed as a capital crimes until as late as 1750 when it was finally removed from the law.

Canadian researchers from C-crest Laboratories have discovered an "unusually high" amount of bacteria in bottled water. Researchers don't blame specific brands, but bottled water in general.

A random study found unusually high rates of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABacteria"&gt;heterotrophic bacteria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the bottled water, more than 500 cfu, the legal limit set by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Pharmacopeia"&gt;United States Pharmacopeia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on how much bacteria should be present in drinking water in &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;. Unusually high amounts of bacteria were present in 70% of the test samples across several brands of bottled water. “Heterotrophic bacteria counts in some of the bottles were found to be in revolting figures of (100) times more than the permitted limit,” said Sonish Azam, a Canadian researcher involved in the study, “This amount of bacteria is alarming, as if we are ingesting a cup of culture.” “Microbiologically speaking,” she said, “tap water is purer than bottled water &amp;mdash; most bottled water. We didn't know this until we conducted the research.”

The bacteria are not very harmful to an average person, but many sensitive groups, such as the young, sick or elderly, could get sick from it. "Heterotrophic bacteria counts in drinking water are not a health concern to the general public," was the concluding analyses of a recent study by the &lt;a href="World%20Health%20Organization"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>Obama to suspend Arctic oil drilling</h1>

According to Democratic Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Begich"&gt;Mark Begich&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from &lt;a href="Alaska"&gt;Alaska&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; Department of the Interior has decided to halt all new Arctic exploratory oil drilling applications until 2011. The response is believed to be caused in part by the two current oil spill disasters (that of the &lt;a href="Deepwater%20Horizon%20drilling%20rig%20explosion"&gt;Deepwater Horizon Incident&lt;/a&gt; and more recently the &lt;a href="Oil%20spill%20in%20Alaska%20closes%20800%20miles%20of%20pipeline"&gt;Alaska oil pipeline malfunction&lt;/a&gt;). However, Begich is not happy about the actions taken by the White House. 

"I am frustrated that this decision by the &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Obama&lt;/a&gt; administration to halt offshore development for a year will cause more delays and higher costs for domestic oil and gas production to meet the nation's energy needs," Begich claims.

Last September, the state of Alaska made a public notice about Shell's desire to drill off the coast of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABeaufort%20Sea"&gt;Beaufort Sea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , placing experimental drilling rigs at two drill site location: "Torpedo" and "Sivulliq".

"Shell is committed to undertaking a safe and environmentally responsible exploration program in the Chukchi Sea and Beaufort Sea in 2010," said &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AShell%20Oil%20Company"&gt;Shell Oil Company&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; President Marvin E. Odum to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Department%20of%20the%20Interior"&gt;U.S. Department of the Interior&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMineral%20Management%20Service"&gt;Mineral Management Service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (MMS).

Odum follows with, "I am confident that we are ready to conduct the 2010 Arctic exploratory program safely and, I want to be clear, the accountability for this program rests with Shell."

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChuck%20Clausen"&gt;Chuck Clausen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , director of the Alaska project at the &lt;a href="Natural%20Resources%20Defense%20Council"&gt;Natural Resources Defense Council&lt;/a&gt; is not so optimistic: "Hazards present in the Arctic can include frigid temperatures, presence of sea ice, gale-force winds, intense storms and heavy fog ... The potential for loss in the Arctic is great."

Odum believes that the climate in the arctic will make any spill easier to clean up because, "Arctic conditions create differences in responding to oil in cold and ice conditions. Differences in evaporation rates, viscosity and weathering provide greater opportunities to recover oil. In Arctic conditions, ice can aid oil spill response by slowing oil weathering, dampening waves, preventing oil from spreading over large distances, and allowing more time to respond."

However, Clausen believes that there are no current systems to remove oil from icy ocean waters. 

This is not the first time that President Obama's administration has taken the environmentally cautious path in Alaska. The President put &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABristol%20Bay"&gt;Bristol Bay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; off limits to oil and gas exploration until 2017. Bristol Bay currently is one of the top salmon fishing grounds in the state.

Interior Secretary &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKen%20Salazar"&gt;Ken Salazar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is expected to give a speech at Thursday's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; address, regarding the suspension of Arctic oil drilling projects.

After reports that &lt;a href="US"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; has fired the director of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMinerals%20Management%20Service"&gt;Minerals Management Service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AS.%20Elizabeth%20Birnbaum"&gt;Elizabeth "Liz" Birnbaum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Interior"&gt;Interior Department&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; revealed that she instead resigned "on her own volition". The resignation occurred amidst growing criticism of the federal government's response to the &lt;a href="Deepwater%20Horizon%20drilling%20rig%20explosion"&gt;Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion&lt;/a&gt; and the agency's oversight over offshore drilling. 

Birnbaum, who became director in June 2009, was expected to testify before a subcommittee of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; today with Interior Secretary &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKen%20Salazar"&gt;Ken Salazar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . She was not present when Salazar began to speak, however. Salazar said in a statement: "She is a good public servant. She resigned today on her own terms and on her own volition. I thank her for her service and wish her the very best."

News agencies had reported that Birnbaum was forced out of office, and Obama was expected to officially announce the supposed firing later today in a news conference along with discussing an Interior Department report on the explosion. Birnbaum observed in her letter of resignation that Salazar "will be requiring three new leaders for the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOffice%20of%20Natural%20Resources%20Revenue"&gt;Office Natural Resources Revenue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABureau%20of%20Ocean%20Energy%20Management"&gt;Bureau of Energy Management&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABureau%20of%20Safety%20and%20Environmental%20Enforcement"&gt;Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; " as the entire Minerals Management Service is reorganized.

The official, Admiral Thad Allen, said that the procedure, known as a "top kill" operation, has been able to block some of the leaking oil at the source, the top of the damaged well. The operation involves pumping material into the well to plug the leak before cement is used to permanently seal the leak. Allen said the operation has "been able to force mud down and not allow any hydrocarbons to come up."

BP hasn't confirmed the success of the top kill operation, saying only that the "operation is proceeding as we planned it," and that there had been no major incidents thus far. Although the possibility of failure is still present, experts say that the longer the procedure continues, the less likely it will be that anything goes wrong.

The procedure began yesterday afternoon, after diagnostics on the damaged equipment on the ocean's surface indicated that it could withstand the added pressure of the mud being pumped into the well. Although engineers involved with the operation wore concerned that the pressure of the mud might not be able to overcome that of the oil, that has thus far not been the case.

Separately, a group of &lt;a href="US"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; scientists announced new estimates of how much oil was flowing from the well, ranging from 12,000 to 25,000 barrels a day, far higher than BP's original estimate of 5,000 barrels a day, a figure which BP warned was possibly inaccurate.

In a press conference Thursday afternoon, US president &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; also announced new measures in response to the spill, which include:
<ul>
BULLET::::- Suspending off-shore test drilling for six months
BULLET::::- Extending the moratorium on issuing drilling permits for an additional six months

Lawyers for former &lt;a href="Illinois"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt; Governor &lt;a href="Rod%20Blagojevich"&gt;Rod Blagojevich&lt;/a&gt; claim that the judge in his corruption trial inappropriately dismissed hundreds of potential jurors without consulting any of the parties in the case. As the trial is likely to last for several months, &lt;a href="US"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; District Judge &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Zagel"&gt;James Zagel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; had stated in a previous hearing that he would conduct a "hardship screening" process and dismiss those jurors he feels would be burdened by this duty. 

The defense team, however, argues that it must be involved in such changes to the jury pool and claims that over 300 people may have been dismissed in this "unilateral" move. The lawyers are expected to request a redo of the selection process during a status hearing before Zagel on Thursday. 

The trial is scheduled to begin on June 3. Blagojevich's lawyers have already filed a request with the US &lt;a href="US%20Supreme%20Court"&gt;Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; to delay the trial on different, constitutional grounds. Justice &lt;a href="John%20Paul%20Stevens"&gt;John Paul Stevens&lt;/a&gt; has given prosecutors until Friday to respond to that motion.

Earlier yesterday, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; state senators voted 21-11 in favor the prohibition of sales of sugared sports drinks at public schools during class hours. Soft drinks are already banned during school hours. "Sugar-sweetened electrolyte replacement beverages are still available and have surged in popularity among kids," said Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAlex%20Padilla"&gt;Alex Padilla&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . "This is a common sense step forward in the effort to address the obesity epidemic in California," he added. Padilla's bill is now on its way to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%20State%20Assembly"&gt;Assembly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Studies have shown that drinks, especially sweetened, contribute to obesity among adults and children, leading to diseases like diabetes. "Eight out of ten drinks sold in California public schools are sports drinks," Padilla said, citing information from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%20Department%20of%20Public%20Health"&gt;California Department of Public Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Governor &lt;a href="Arnold%20Schwarzenegger"&gt;Schwarzenegger&lt;/a&gt; is sponsoring a package of legislation aimed at reducing child obesity in California.

Today on Wikinews : As BP reports cautious optimism in it's "top kill" operation to stop the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the head of US Minerals Management Service resigns and Democratic Senator Mark Begich from Alaska says the Obama administration's moratorium on issuing drilling permits will result in higher costs for domestic oil and gas production. In other news, Space Shuttle Atlantis lands at Kennedy Space Center; the island nation of Vanuatu is hit by a 7.2 magnitude earthquake and, in history, in 1884, Max Brod, friend of Franz Kafka, is born in Prague.

Today is Thursday, May 27th, 2010. I'm Dan Harlow and this is Wikinews.
<h2>Script</h2>
<h3>&lt;a href="BP%20says%20Gulf%20oil%20spill%20slowed%20as%20estimates%20of%20oil%20spilled%20increase"&gt;BP says Gulf oil spill slowed as estimates of oil spilled increase&lt;/a&gt; (1:10)</h3>

A US Coast Guard official said today that BP's latest effort to plug the Gulf of Mexico oil spill has been successful in slowing the amount of oil leaking from the well. The official, Admiral Thad Allen, said that the procedure, known as a "top kill" operation, has been able to block some of the leaking oil at the source. 

The operation involves pumping material into the well to plug the leak before cement is used to permanently seal the leak. Allen said the operation has "been able to force mud down and not allow any hydrocarbons to come up."

BP hasn't confirmed the success of the top kill operation, saying only that the "operation is proceeding as we planned it," and that there had been no major incidents thus far. Although the possibility of failure is still present, experts say that the longer the procedure continues, the less likely it will be that anything goes wrong.

The procedure began yesterday afternoon, after diagnostics on the damaged equipment on the ocean's surface indicated that it could withstand the added pressure of the mud being pumped into the well. Although engineers involved with the operation wore concerned that the pressure of the mud might not be able to overcome that of the oil, that has thus far not been the case.

Separately, a group of US scientists announced new estimates of how much oil was flowing from the well, ranging from 12,000 to 25,000 barrels a day, far higher than BP's original estimate of 5,000 barrels a day, a figure which BP warned was possibly inaccurate.

In a press conference Thursday afternoon, US president Barack Obama also announced new measures in response to the spill, which include suspending off-shore test drilling for six months, extending the moratorium on issuing drilling permits for an additional six months, and canceling the sale of leases for off-shore drilling.

In statements, Obama criticized the "scandalously close relationship" between government officials and oil companies in the past, saying that the Mineral Management Service, which is the agency responsible for monitoring off-shore drilling, had been corrupt for years.

In lieu of the criticism of the Mineral Management Service, 

<h3>&lt;a href="Head%20of%20US%20Minerals%20Management%20Service%20resigns%20following%20BP%20oil%20spill%20response"&gt;Head of US Minerals Management Service resigns following BP oil spill response&lt;/a&gt; (3:20)</h3>

after reports that US President Barack Obama had fired the director of the Minerals Management Service, Elizabeth "Liz" Birnbaum, the Interior Department revealed that she instead resigned "on her own volition". The resignation occurred amidst growing criticism of the federal government's response to the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion and the agency's oversight over offshore drilling. 

Birnbaum, who became director in June 2009, was expected to testify before a subcommittee of the House of Representatives today with Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, however, she was not present when Salazar began to speak.

News agencies had reported that Birnbaum was forced out of office, and Obama was expected to officially announce the supposed firing later today in a news conference along with discussing an Interior Department report on the oil rig explosion. Birnbaum observed in her letter of resignation that Salazar "will be requiring three new leaders for the Office Natural Resources Revenue, the Bureau of Energy Management and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement" as the entire Minerals Management Service is reorganized.

Not everyone was pleased with President Obama's decision to halt all new Arctic exploratory oil drilling applications until 2011, however.

<h3>&lt;a href="Obama%20to%20suspend%20Arctic%20oil%20drilling"&gt;Obama to suspend Arctic oil drilling&lt;/a&gt; (4:32)</h3>

In a statement from Democratic Senator Mark Begich from Alaska, he said "I am frustrated that this decision by the Obama administration to halt offshore development for a year will cause more delays and higher costs for domestic oil and gas production to meet the nation's energy needs".

Last September, the state of Alaska made a public notice about Shell's desire to drill off the coast of the Beaufort Sea, placing experimental drilling rigs at two drill site locations and in a statement by Shell Oil Company President Marvin E. Odum to the U.S. Department of the Interior's Mineral Management Service, "Shell is committed to undertaking a safe and environmentally responsible exploration program ...".

Chuck Clausen, director of the Alaska project at the National Resources Defense Council is not so optimistic, stating, "Hazards present in the Arctic can include frigid temperatures, presence of sea ice, gale-force winds, intense storms and heavy fog ... The potential for loss in the Arctic is great."

Odum countered by saying that he believes the climate in the arctic will make any spill easier to clean up because "In Arctic conditions, ice can aid oil spill response by slowing oil weathering, dampening waves, preventing oil from spreading over large distances, and allowing more time to respond."

However, Clausen believes that there are no current systems to remove oil from icy ocean waters.

This is not the first time that President Obama's administration has taken the environmentally cautious path in Alaska. The President put Bristol Bay off limits to oil and gas exploration until 2017. Bristol Bay currently is one of the top salmon fishing grounds in the state.

<h3>&lt;a href="Vanuatu%20hit%20by%207.2%20magnitude%20earthquake"&gt;Vanuatu hit by 7.2 magnitude earthquake&lt;/a&gt; (7:03)</h3>

the island nation of Vanuatu, located 1,750 kilometers to the east of Australia, was hit by a 7.2 magnitude earthquake at 04:14 local time. In response, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Pacific Tsunami Warning Center issued a tsunami warning for Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands and New Caledonia, though "it is not known that a tsunami was generated". 

The Vanuatu government Meteorological Office reported infrastructure cracks, and power outages, but does not foresee major damage and there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries according to reports by CNN reporters.

As scientists monitor the southern oceans, 

<h3>&lt;a href="Bottled%20water%20concerns%20health%20experts"&gt;Bottled water concerns health experts&lt;/a&gt; (7:45)</h3>

Canadian researchers from C-crest Laboratories have discovered an "unusually high" amount of bacteria in bottled water. Researchers don't blame specific brands, but bottled water in general.

A random study found unusually high rates of heterotrophic bacteria in the bottled water. Heterotrophic bacteria are organisms that use organic carbon for growth by consuming other organisms. Legal limits set by United States Pharmacopeia on how much bacteria should be present in drinking water in Canada is set at no more than 500 colony-forming units, yet the unusually high amounts of bacteria were present in 70% of the test samples across several brands of bottled water.

Sonish Azam, a Canadian researcher involved in the study, stated that “this amount of bacteria is alarming, as if we are ingesting a cup of culture.” “Microbiologically speaking,” she continued, “tap water is purer than ... most bottled water. We didn't know this until we conducted the research.”

The bacteria are not very harmful to an average person, but many sensitive groups, such as the young, sick or elderly, could get sick from it. However, in a recent study by the World Health Organization, the concluding analyses was that "heterotrophic bacteria counts in drinking water are not a health concern to the general public,"

Moving on now to a part of the world where water in any form is scarce, 

<h3>&lt;a href="Sudanese%20president%20sworn%20in%20to%20another%20term"&gt;Sudanese president sworn in to another term&lt;/a&gt; (9:13)</h3>

Omar al-Bashir, the president of Sudan, has been sworn in to another term after winning the country's recent polls, which were largely boycotted by the opposition.

The inauguration ceremony, attended by multiple African leaders and two diplomats from the United Nations, was held earlier today. A reporter for the Al Jazeera news agency described the event as being primarily "a gathering of African leaders".

In his inauguration speech, al-Bashir said that there would be "no return to war" with southern Sudan, and said a referendum on southern independence would be held on time. Southern Sudan is to hold a ballot in January of next year on whether to secede from the rest of the country. The referendum is a key part of the 2005 peace deal that ended Sudan's north-south civil war.

al-Bashir was re-elected in April with 68% of the vote. Many opposition parties boycotted the election, accusing the president's party of having rigged the result.

The president is wanted by the International Criminal Court on charges of war crimes, including allegations that he ordered mass murder, rape and torture in Darfur, where rebels have frequently clashed with the government; al-Bashir strongly denies the claims.

Another embattled politician, former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich wants to restart jury selection in his corruption trial.

<h3>&lt;a href="Blagojevich%20defense%20team%20wants%20to%20restart%20jury%20selection%20in%20Illinois%20corruption%20trial"&gt;Blagojevich defense team wants to restart jury selection in Illinois corruption trial&lt;/a&gt; (10:33)</h3>

His lawyers claim that the judge in his trial inappropriately dismissed hundreds of potential jurors without consulting any of the parties in the case. As the trial is likely to last for several months, US District Judge James Zagel had stated in a previous hearing that he would conduct a "hardship screening" process and dismiss those jurors he feels would be burdened by this duty. 

The defense team, however, argues that it must be involved in such changes to the jury pool and claims that over 300 people may have been dismissed in this "unilateral" move. The lawyers are expected to request a redo of the selection process during a status hearing before Zagel on Thursday. 

The trial is scheduled to begin on June 3. Blagojevich's lawyers have already filed a request with the US Supreme Court to delay the trial on different, constitutional grounds. Justice John Paul Stevens has given prosecutors until Friday to respond to that motion.

Linkletter, originally known as Gordon Arthur Kelly, was born in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan before being adopted by the Linkletter family. Linkletter was predeceased by his daughter, Diane, who died from a fall from a sixth floor Hollywood apartment. He is survived by his wife, two other daughters, seven grandchildren, and numerous great grandchildren.

As the owner of Linkletter Enterprises, Linkletter also owned real estate in Australia and invested in oil wells.

As the American Space Shuttle program nears the end of operations by the close of this year, Space Shuttle Atlantis landed yesterday at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, after 11 days, 18 hours and 4.8 million miles in space.

The mission, designated STS-132, carried the Russian-built Mini Research Module named Rassvet and an Integrated Cargo Carrier-Vertical Light Deployable (ICC-VLD) to the International Space Station, and featured three spacewalks, after docking with the station on the third day of her mission.

STS-132 was commanded by Kenneth Ham, piloted by Dominic A. Antonelli, and the four mission specialists were Garrett Reisman, Michael T. Good (who replaced Karen Nyberg due to a temporary medical condition), Stephen G. Bowen and Piers Sellers. This was at least the second time all of the crew had ridden aboard a previous shuttle mission and was Sellers's third trip to space.

This was Space Shuttle Atlantis' 32nd mission and its last, completing almost 25 years of service. Along with Atlantis, the Space Shuttles Endeavour and Discovery will also be retired in 2010 and the shuttles will be shown at museums around the country.

In 1884, Max Brod was born in Prague. Although he was a prolific writer in his own right, he is most famous as a friend, biographer, and literary executor of Franz Kafka.

Brod was a German speaking Jew who had studied law at the German Charles-Ferdinand University, graduating in 1907. By 1924 he was already an established writer and also worked as a critic. 

In 1939, as the Nazis took over Prague, Brod and his wife Elsa fled to Palestine, settling in Tel Aviv, where he continued to write and worked as a dramaturg for the Israeli national theater for 30 years. When Elsa died in 1942, Brod was supported by his close companion Felix Weltsch, a friendship which had lasted 75 years from their days in Elementary school in Prague. 

However, Brod's most famous friendship was with Franz Kafka, one of the most influential fiction writers of the early 20th century. Brod first met Kafka on October 23, 1902, when both were students at Charles University. Brod had been giving a lecture at the German students' hall on Arthur Schopenhaue when Kafka addressed him after the lecture and accompanied him home.

From then on, Brod and Kafka met frequently, often even daily, and remained close friends until Kafka's death in 1924. Kafka was a frequent guest in Brod's parents' house and it was here that he met his future girlfriend and fiancée Felice Bauer, a cousin of Brod's brother-in-law. Brod, Kafka and Brod's long time friend Felix Weltsch constituted the so-called "close Prague circle" of friends.

Unlike Kafka, Brod rapidly became a prolific, successful published writer. His first novel and fourth book overall, was published in 1908 when he was only 24, and was celebrated in Berlin literary circles as a masterpiece of expressionism. 

During Kafka's lifetime, Brod tried repeatedly to reassure Kafka in rejecting his doubts about his own literary efforts, and Brod pushed Kafka to publish his work. Before even a line of Kafka's work had been published, Brod had already praised him as "the greatest poet of our time", ranking with Goethe or Tolstoy.

The two also tried, but failed, to arrange common literary projects but notwithstanding their inability to write in tandem, which stemmed from clashing literary and personal philosophies, they were able to publish one chapter from an attempted travelogue in May 1912, for which Kafka wrote the introduction.

On Kafka's death in 1924 Brod was the administrator of the estate and preserved his unpublished works from incineration despite what was stipulated in the will. He defended this course by saying that when Kafka asked him to burn his papers, he told him he would not carry out this wish, adding, "Franz should have appointed another executor if he had been absolutely and finally determined that his instructions should stand". When Brod fled Prague in 1939, he took with him a suitcase of Kafka's papers, some of which he later edited and published in 6 volumes of collected works.

In 1937 Brod wrote the first biography of Kafka, and he always resisted one-sided interpretation of Kafka, hating the term "Kafkaesque," arguing that it presented a picture of the man and his work contradicted by his own intimate knowledge.

On December 20, 1968, Brod died in Tel Aviv at the age of 84.

Obama told journalists in a news conference that an official report on the allegations will be released "shortly". 

Sestak made the allegations first in February. Media attention grew, however, only when he defeated &lt;a href="Arlen%20Specter"&gt;Arlen Specter&lt;/a&gt;, the incumbent senator and White House-preferred candidate, in the Senate primary last week. Since then, there has been more pressure on the Obama administration to reveal what they discussed with Sestak. 

&lt;a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; leaders have asked the Attorney General's office to review the legal implications of this job offer, but the Justice Department has rejected other requests to investigate or appoint a special prosecutor.

The men's &lt;a href="basketball"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt; program of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Connecticut"&gt;University of Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (UConn) has been cited by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association"&gt;National Collegiate Athletic Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (NCAA) for eight major violations of its recruiting policy. These allegations have resulted in the resignation of two of the team's assistant coaches, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABeau%20Archibald"&gt;Beau Archibald&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;Patrick Sellers&lt;/span&gt; . Head coach &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Calhoun"&gt;Jim Calhoun&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is also accused by the NCAA of not monitoring the activities of his assistant coaches closely enough, which they said lead to the rules violations.

These citations come after the NCAA's 15-monthlong investigation relating to the team's possible recruiting violations of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;Nate Miles&lt;/span&gt; , who was set to play for the team during the 2007&amp;ndash;08 season until he was expelled from the school for a restraining order violation. Sellers and Archibald are accused of placing 160 unauthorized phone calls and sending 191 unauthorized text messages to recruits who had not yet committed to play for the team yet, which is a violation of NCAA rules because teams are only allowed to place a certain amount of phone calls to recruits.

"Coaching is my passion and something I have spent many years of enjoyment doing I want the record to reflect this and for the people to see the respect and integrity that I will show toward the process in the months ahead," said Sellers in a statement, promising to cooperate with any further NCAA investigation.

Former coach Archibald also allegedly placed an unauthorized phone call that lasted approximately 29 minutes. However, the player's name was kept anonymous and withheld from the report. The investigation also reports that the two accused assistant coaches gave improper and false information when NCAA investigators interviewed the two about the situation. Both Sellers and Archibald have resigned within the past 2 weeks. 

It's not exactly, certainly anywhere near the high point of my career, as a matter of fact it's certainly one of the lowest points at any time that you are accused of doing something. It's a very serious matter," said Calhoun, who has been the coach for UConn for the past 28 years. Calhoun, 68, has already been enshrined in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACollege%20Basketball%20Hall%20of%20Fame"&gt;College Basketball Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and recently signed a &lt;a href="US%24"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;13 million contract extension with UConn. In the NCAA report, Calhoun, among other things, was criticised for not watching over "...the conduct and administration of the men's basketball staff in the areas of: telephone records, representatives of the institution's athletics interests; and, complimentary admissions or discretionary tickets,"

UConn has been scheduled to appear in front of NCAA investigators on October 18 for sanctioning and further investigation. It is likely that the basketball program could lose scholarships and receive probation.

A man accused of being a serial killer has appeared in the Bradford magistrates court in West Yorkshire today charged with three counts of murder. 40-year-old Stephen Griffiths is accused of killing three prostitutes, Suzanne Blamires, 36, Susan Rushworth, 43, and Shelley Armitage, 31.

Griffiths, a former van driver with a degree in psychology and studying for a PhD in criminology, gave his name as "Crossbow Cannibal" when asked. He has been in police custody since Monday when police were alerted to a CCTV recording that appeared to show a murder.

A caretaker had been reviewing footage from the flats where Griffiths lives when he saw footage of a woman and a man enter a flat early on Saturday morning. Two minutes later, she ran out and was followed by the man, who beat her to the ground and shot her in the head with a crossbow. Over the course of the weekend, the man was seen several times with bin bags and a rucksack.

On Tuesday, the day after the arrest of Griffiths, Blamires' remains were found in the River Aire in nearby Shipley. She had been cut into several pieces and her head was located in a rucksack. Police continue to search for the other two alleged victims; Rushworth has been missing since June last year and Armitage vanished in April.

Police have searched much of Bradford's red-light district, where Griffiths' third-floor flat is located. Forensic investigations at the flat are expected to last around three weeks. There are plans to search landfill sites for bodies, and police may yet expand the inquiry to cover three more cold cases, although at present they have not been linked to the current inquiry.

Griffiths was known as "the lizard man" in his block of flats owing to his habit of walking his two pet monitor lizards in the area. One neighbor is reported to have quoted him as saying he was studying for "a PhD in murder and Jack the Ripper," and he had spent time in a high-security psychiatric hospital. During his five-minute court appearance he did not enter a plea, kept his head bowed and fidgeted with his cuffed hands. He said "Here, I guess," when asked for his address.

As he stood in court, guarded by three security officers, he was watched by the families of Rushworth and Armitage, who were accompanied by police family liaison officers. Blamires' family chose not to be present, but the victim's mother Nicky Blamires, 54, has told the press that Suzanne was a "much-loved" family member even thogh she "went down the wrong path and did not have the life she was meant to have." "Nobody deserves this," she said. "All these girls were human beings and people's daughters."

Griffiths' morning court appearance was followed by a second one this afternoon, at Bradford Crown Court. This time, he confirmed his name without incident. He was remanded into custody until next month, when he will appear in court again.

British media has been quick to compare the case to Peter Sutcliffe, dubbed the "Yorkshire Ripper". Sutcliffe was a Bradford killer responsible for thirteen murders and seven attempted murders, including several prostitutes. Since his 1981 conviction he has spent most of the last three decades in Broadmoor high-security psychiatric hospital near London.

While the UK attempts to cope with the aftermath of the serial killings, violence also broke out in India as

<h3>&lt;a href="At%20least%2065%20dead%20after%20train%20derailment%20in%20West%20Bengal%2C%20India"&gt;At least 65 dead after train derailment in West Bengal, India&lt;/a&gt; (4:23)</h3>

at least 65 people were killed and over 200 injured when suspected Maoist rebels triggered an attack on an Express train in West Bengal derailing it near the city of Sardiha. 

The incident occurred at around 1:30 a.m. local time, and police forces and local medics took an hour to reach the site. Lack of roads and the fear of an ambush by Maoists slowed rescue operations as the region is a Maoist stronghold where multiple attacks have occurred in the recent past.

Air Force helicopters managed to arrive on scene at dawn as local television footage showed onlookers standing on the top of the affected carriages, as soldiers cut holes in the roofs with a gas-powered circular saw. A doctor at a nearby hospital noted 30 bodies had been taken to the hospital, but "a lot of dead bodies are strewn under the derailed carriages," he added. Home Secretary of the state, Samar Ghosh, said 65 bodies had been found so far.

The exact cause of the disaster was unclear, with some officials claiming an explosion had led to the attack, while some unaffected passengers stating they heard no blast. The driver said he had heard an explosion in the attack which derailed as many as ten passenger coaches five of which were subsequently struck by a freight train coming in the opposite direction.

Police officials, including the head of police of the state, said the metallic parts which held sections of the rail track together were missing and he labeled this as an act of sabotage. Maoists leaflets were also found at the scene. According to the country's railways minister, there was "definitely sabotage" and a bomb blast had led to the derailment. The minister also announced a compensation of $11,000 and a job in her ministry for the families of the dead and $2,200 for those wounded.

The Maoists guerrillas who are known as "Naxalites" are powerful force in the relatively poorer states of India. In the past few years, poor or landless peasants and tribesman have rendered their support towards the insurgents, due to the wealth gap and as a result of the former losing their land to government-aided mining companies.

As citizen in India react angrily to the growing economic divide in that nation, workers in Taiwan are also feeling pressured as

<h3>&lt;a href="Foxconn%20under%20pressure%20after%20tenth%20employee%20suicide%20this%20year"&gt;Foxconn under pressure after tenth employee suicide this year&lt;/a&gt; (6:50)</h3>

Taiwan electronics giant Foxconn has moved to repair its reputation after the suicide of a tenth employee this year. 

The latest death came on the same day as Terry Gou, Chairman of Foxconn's parent Hon Hai Precision, opened the Shenzen production facility to the media for the first time. In the face of accusations that he ran a modern day sweatshop, he showed off employee recreation facilities. Gou, bowing as an expression of regret, promised to work to prevent such tragedies occurring again.

Although not a household name, Foxconn is the largest producer of electronics components and badge engineered electronics products in the world, Badge engineer is the replacement of the branding trademark of one product as another. Foxconn manufactures products for companies like Intel, Hewlett-Packard and Apple.

Labor activists have criticized conditions at Foxconn's factories as "military-style", with workers working long shifts and not being able to speak to each other. However, Foxconn claims that the suicides were mostly the result of relationship problems unrelated to its own management style, and it argues that for a work force so large the number of suicides is small.

<h3>&lt;a href="UK%20Conservative%20party%20wins%20last%20seat%20in%202010%20general%20election"&gt;UK Conservative party wins last seat in 2010 general election&lt;/a&gt; (8:50)</h3>

The United Kingdom's Conservative Party has won the last seat of the 2010 general election, taking the seat of Thirsk and Malton with a majority of over 11,000. Voting in the constituency had been delayed by the death of the UK Independence Party candidate in the run-up to the original polling date of May 6, 2010.

The new MP, Anne McIntosh, took over 52% of the vote, with the Liberal Democrats – partners with the Conservatives in the coalition government – in second place. Despite the relationship between the parties in government, the Liberal Democrat candidate Howard Keal had promised that there would be a "full-on fight" for the seat. The Labour Party came third, although the fall in its share of the vote was described by political opponents as "catastrophic" for the party.

This was the first election held for the constituency, which was formed from parts of two former Conservative-held seats. The Conservatives' share of the vote rose by 0.2%, with the Liberal Democrats up 5% and the Labour Party down 11.6%.

McIntosh, formerly MP for the Vale of York constituency, said that she was "delighted", adding that it was a "very exciting time" in politics.

In a victory that's just as "sweet", 

<h3>&lt;a href="California%20Senate%20prohibits%20sports%20drinks%20in%20public%20schools"&gt;California Senate prohibits sports drinks in public schools&lt;/a&gt; (10:06)</h3>

earlier today, California state senators voted 21 in favor and eleven against the prohibition of sales of sugared sports drinks at public schools during class hours. Soft drinks are already banned during school hours.

Studies have shown that sweetened drinks contribute to obesity among adults and children, leading to diseases like diabetes. According to Senator Alex Padilla, "Sugar-sweetened electrolyte replacement beverages are still available and have surged in popularity among kids,". He added that the bill "is a a common sense step forward in the effort to address the obesity epidemic in California,"

Governor Schwarzenegger is also sponsoring a package of legislation aimed at reducing child obesity in California and today's bill will now move to the state assembly for further legislation. 

However, not all political victories have been without controversy as

<h3>&lt;a href="US%20Representative%20Joe%20Sestak%20allegedly%20offered%20job%20by%20Obama%20to%20stay%20out%20of%20Senate%20election"&gt;US Representative Joe Sestak allegedly offered job by Obama to stay out of Senate election&lt;/a&gt; (11:03)</h3>

US Representative Joe Sestak, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, says that he was offered a job in the Obama administration if he would drop out of a Senate primary election. Obama told journalists in a news conference that an official report on the allegations will be released "shortly". 

Sestak made the allegations first in February. Media attention grew, however, only when he defeated Arlen Specter, the incumbent senator and White House-preferred candidate, in the Senate primary last week. Since then, there has been more pressure on the Obama administration to reveal what they discussed with Sestak. 

Republican leaders have asked the Attorney General's office to review the legal implications of this job offer, but the Justice Department has rejected other requests to investigate or appoint a special prosecutor. 

Charges of corruption are not limited to the political realm today as

<h3>(11:59)</h3>

the mens basketball program at the University of Connecticut has been cited by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) for eight major violations of its recruiting policy. These allegations have resulted in the resignation of two of the team's assistant coaches, Beau Archibald and Patrick Sellers. Head coach Jim Calhoun is also accused by the NCAA of not monitoring the activities of his assistant coaches closely enough, which they said lead to the rules violations.

These citations come after the NCAA's 15-month long investigation relating to the team's possible recruiting violations of Nate Miles, who was set to play for the team during the 2007-08 season until he was expelled from the school for a restraining order violation. Sellers and Archibald are accused of placing 160 unauthorized phone calls and sending 191 unauthorized text messages to recruits who had not yet committed to play for the team yet, which is a violation of NCAA rules because teams are only allowed to place a certain amount of phone calls to recruits.

Former coach Archibald also allegedly placed an unauthorized phone call that lasted approximately 29 minutes. However, the player's name was kept anonymous and withheld from the report. The investigation also reports that the two accused assistant coaches gave improper and false information when NCAA investigators interviewed the two about the situation.

Calhoun, aged 68, has been the coach for UConn for the past 28 years and has already been enshrined in the College Basketball Hall of Fame as well as recently signing a $13 million contract extension with UConn. "It's not exactly, certainly anywhere near the high point of my career," Calhoun said in a statement, "as a matter of fact it's certainly one of the lowest points at any time that you are accused of doing something. It's a very serious matter,"

UConn has been scheduled to appear in front of NCAA investigators on October 18 for sanctioning and further investigation. It is likely that the basketball program could lose scholarships and receive probation.

<h3>&lt;a href="US%20actor%20Gary%20Coleman%20dies%20aged%2042"&gt;US actor Gary Coleman dies aged 42&lt;/a&gt; (14:45)</h3>

US actor Gary Coleman has died at the Utah Valley Regional Medical Center in Provo, Utah after complications from a brain hemorrhage. Coleman was admitted to the hospital on May 26 after falling and injuring his head then went into a coma on May 27, requiring life support. He was taken off life support and died shortly after noon on Friday. 

Coleman had been suffering multiple medical problems throughout his life, however it is unknown if these problems affected his death. He suffered from a congenital kidney disease which required two transplants and daily dialysis. On February 27, 2010 Coleman suffered a seizure on the set of the television show The Insider.

Coleman's career began with appearances in the US sit-com's The Jeffersons and Good Times but he was best known for his recurring role as Arnold Jackson on Diff'rent Strokes and his recurring line, "What'choo talkin' 'bout, Willis?".

Coleman was 42 years old.

<h3>&lt;a href="Experimental%20aircraft%20breaks%20record%20for%20hypersonic%20flight"&gt;Experimental aircraft breaks record for hypersonic flight&lt;/a&gt; (15:52)</h3>

the experimental Boeing X-51A Waverider scramjet managed to break a hypersonic flight record Wednesday during a test flight.

The United States Air Force (USAF) said that the scramjet was able to fly for 200 seconds, achieving a top speed of around Mach 5 and setting a new record for what the Air Force called "the longest supersonic combustion ramjet-powered hypersonic flight." The previous record of twelve seconds was set by the NASA X-43 in 2004. This hypersonic flight, also the first to use hydrocarbon fuel, was hailed by US government officials as a success. Despite an unknown failure which caused the X-51 to lose acceleration, an X-51 program manager said that the USAF was "ecstatic" about the event's accomplishments.

The X-51 is 14 feet long and has no real wings, allowing it to withstand the shock wave created during flight.

</ul>
The aircraft was launched over the Point Mugu Naval Air Warfare Center Sea Range from under the wing of a Boeing B-52 Stratofortress at 50,000 feet around 10 a.m. PDT. The X-51 was then propelled by a solid rocket booster to Mach 4.8.

After about 200 seconds in flight, Boeing said that "something then occurred that caused the vehicle to lose acceleration", possibly due to an engine blowout. "At that point, the X-51A was terminated as planned." Although it was expected to fly for about 300 seconds and reach Mach 6, the scramjet only managed Mach 5 at a height of about 70,000 feet. The aircraft then landed in the ocean as planned, however there are no plans to retrieve it.

This test is the first of four planned flights for the X-51 program, with the other three planned for this coming fall. Previously, the X-51 had flown twice, but remained attached to the B-52 both times.

In 585 BCE, the Battle of Halys, also known as the Battle of the Eclipse, took place at the Halys River (in present-day in Turkey) between the Medes and the Lydians. This was the final battle of a five-year war between Alyattes II, commander of the Lydians and Cyaxares who commanded the Medes. The battle ended abruptly due to a total solar eclipse which was perceived as an omen, indicating that the gods wanted the fighting to stop.

Famed ancient historian Herodotus states that there were two reasons for the war. First, the two sides had clashing interests in Anatolia, but also there was a motive of revenge. The desire for revenge was over some Scythian hunters employed by the Medes who once returned empty-handed and were insulted by Cyaxares. In revenge the hunters slaughtered one of his sons and served him to the Medes. The hunters then fled to Sardis, the capital of the Lydians. When Cyaxares asked for the Scythians to be returned to him, Alyattes refused to hand them over so, in response, the Medes invaded.

According to Herodotus's "Histories", "when they saw that it had become night instead of day, they ceased from their fighting and were much more eager that peace should be made between them."

In the aftermath, a truce was hastily arranged. As part of the terms of the agreement, Alyattes's daughter Aryenis was married to Cyaxares's son Astyages, and the river Halys was declared to be the border of the two warring nations.

Since the exact dates of eclipses can be calculated, the Battle of the Eclipse is the earliest historical event of which the date is known with such precision.

The &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; Government is watching the "&lt;a href="BP%20says%20Gulf%20oil%20spill%20slowed%20as%20estimates%20of%20oil%20spilled%20increase"&gt;slowing growth&lt;/a&gt;" of the BP oil spill. 

Canada is running their &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABombardier%20Dash%208"&gt;dash-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on a twice a day mission to the gulf, monitoring for signs that the BP &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOil%20spill"&gt;Oil slick&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; may expand up the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20seaboard"&gt;Eastern seaboard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; into Canadian waters, and to provide assistance to US efforts to contain the spill. This started in May, and is expected to continue until the spill has been fully contained, or no longer needed. Canada has also provided technical experts, research and development teams, and general staffing to assist in spill containment and cleanup. 

While the risk is slim that the oil slick will move up the seaboard enough to get into Canadian waters, it is possible. Currently the spill is being held within the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGulf%20of%20Mexico"&gt;Gulf of Mexico&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , however, as the spill grows each day it is at bigger risk of being picked up by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALoop%20Current"&gt;Loop Current&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . 

"If oil is swept up into the Loop Current—which moves at about 3.3 to 6.5 feet (one to two meters) a second—there's essentially no way to stop it," Tony Sturges, professor emeritus of oceanography at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFlorida%20State%20University"&gt;Florida State University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , told &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Geographic"&gt;National Geographic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . "Once [oil] gets into the loop current, you can bet the farm it will go around to the south" 

After being picked up by the Loop Current, the oil spill could then quickly be carried further by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGulf%20Stream"&gt;Gulf Stream&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which can travel up to 2.5 metres per second (5.6 mph). This current leads right through some of Canada's best fishing waters, and could potentially even be washed up directly onto the shores of Canada, if not properly contained.

This spill could devastate the fishing industry of Canada, and harm any potential tourism on the beautiful coastal waters of Eastern Canada. So while Canada is offering its hand to the United States as a gesture of assistance, it serves dually as a self assurance that Canada will not be affected by the spill, and to stop it before it reaches the border if it does get picked up by the currents.

The &lt;a href="US"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; Supreme Court has denied &lt;a href="Illinois"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt; Governor &lt;a href="Rod%20Blagojevich"&gt;Rod Blagojevich&lt;/a&gt;'s request to delay his corruption trial after receiving a statement from the federal government in opposition. 

The trial is set to begin on June 3, and many of the charges Blagojevich faces are based on a federal honest-services fraud law. He challenged the &lt;a href="US%20Constitution"&gt;constitutionality&lt;/a&gt; of this law and argued that the trial should be delayed until the high court decides the issue. The request had already been denied by judges in the lower courts. 

The &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Obama&lt;/a&gt; administration argued that there was no need to delay the trial pending the Supreme Court's decision. Shortly afterwards, Justice &lt;a href="John%20Paul%20Stevens"&gt;John Paul Stevens&lt;/a&gt; rejected the motion.

Today on Wikinews : Guatemala's Pacaya Volcano erupts, the US Supreme Court rejects Rob Blagojeviches motion to delay his corruption trial, Malawis president pardons a jailed gay couple and American Dennis Hpper dies.

Today is Saturday, May 29th, 2010. I'm Patrick Gillett and this is Wikinews.

<h2>Script</h2>

<h3>&lt;a href="Pacaya%20volcano%20erupts%3B%20%26quot%3Bstate%20of%20public%20calamity%26quot%3B%20decreed"&gt;Pacaya volcano erupts; "state of public calamity" decreed&lt;/a&gt;</h3>
The Pacaya Volcano has erupted on Friday. The volcano is located 50 kilometers south of the capital of Guatemala, Guatemala City. Throughout the evening and night, volcanic ash has fallen in the municipalities of Amatitlán, Villa Nueva, and Guatemala City.

President Álvaro Colom's government has decreed a State of Public Calamity in the Escuintla, Sacatepéquez and Guatemala departments, for 15 days or more, so the authorities can do their job correctly. The emergency response is being coordinated by the National Coordination for Disaster Reduction.

The eruption was followed by several tremors. All flights in and out of Guatemala City's La Aurora International Airport, have been suspended. The eruption has caused many casualties, among them the death of Aníbal Archila, NOTI7's reporter, who was one of the first reporting the event.

<h3>&lt;a href="US%20Supreme%20Court%20rejects%20Blagojevich%20motion%20to%20delay%20Illinois%20corruption%20trial"&gt;US Supreme Court rejects Blagojevich motion to delay Illinois corruption trial&lt;/a&gt;</h3>
The US Supreme Court has denied Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich's request to delay his corruption trial after receiving a statement from the federal government in opposition.

The trial is set to begin on June 3, and many of the charges Blagojevich faces are based on a federal honest-services fraud law. He challenged the constitutionality of this law and argued that the trial should be delayed until the high court decides the issue. The request had already been denied by judges in the lower courts.

The Obama administration argued that there was no need to delay the trial pending the Supreme Court's decision. Shortly afterwards, Justice John Paul Stevens rejected the motion.

<h3>&lt;a href="Malawi%20President%20pardons%20jailed%20gay%20couple"&gt;Malawi President pardons jailed gay couple&lt;/a&gt;</h3>
Bingu wa Mutharika, President of the African country of Malawi, granted pardons to a gay couple who had been sentenced to 14 years in jail for sodomy and indecency charges. Mutharika, who has in the past dismissed homosexuality as alien, stated that he was releasing the couple on humanitarian grounds.

On Thursday, the President of South Africa condemned the decision of the Malawi courts in a rare dissenting statement stating, "We have condemned the action taken to arrest people in terms of our constitution," in response to questions about the Malawi arrests.

In December, Steven Monjeza, 26, and Tiwonge Chimbalanga, 20, were arrested following a personal engagement ceremony. The men were charged with gross indecency and unnatural acts, based on laws imposed during the British colonial period in Malawi.

<h3>&lt;a href="US%20actor%20Dennis%20Hopper%20dies%20at%20age%2074"&gt;US actor Dennis Hopper dies at age 74&lt;/a&gt;</h3>
American actor, director, and artist Dennis Hopper has died today at the age of 74. He was known to suffer from prostate cancer since October 2009.

He was born Dennis Lee Hopper on May 17, 1936 in Dodge City, California. As a young man, Hopper became interested in acting and eventually became a student of the Actors Studio. He made his first television appearance in 1955, and appeared in two films featuring James Dean, Rebel Without a Cause (1955) and Giant (1956). Over the next ten years, Hopper appeared frequently on television in guest roles, and by the end of the 1960s had played supporting roles in several films. He directed and starred in Easy Rider (1969), winning an award at the Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay as co-writer of the film's script.

Hopper was unable to build on this success for several years, until a featured role in 1979's Apocalypse Now brought him attention. He subsequently received critical recognition for his work in Blue Velvet and Hoosiers, with the latter film garnering him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Hopper's more recent work includes a leading role in the television series Crash

<h2>On this day in history</h2>

Six minutes later, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABrian%20Campbell"&gt;Brian Campbell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was sent off for high-sticking and the Flyers converted on the power play with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AScott%20Hartnell"&gt;Scott Hartnell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; lighting the lamp for Philadelphia. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Bri%C3%A8re"&gt;Daniel Brière&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; put the Flyers 3–2 up going into the first intermission with just 27 seconds left in the period.

With the second period just 71 seconds old, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Sharp"&gt;Patrick Sharp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; evened the score at three. Blackhawk &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20Burish"&gt;Adam Burish&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was sent off for boarding at the 4:59 mark, but the Flyers could not extend their lead, ending up converting one of their four power plays (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABen%20Eager"&gt;Ben Eager&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was sent off for cross checking early in the first period). &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABlair%20Betts"&gt;Blair Betts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; gave the Flyers their final lead of the game with a shot at the 7:20 mark of the period. The Blackhawks' &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKris%20Versteeg"&gt;Kris Versteeg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; responded two minutes later and at 15:18 mark the Brouwer completed his three-point night with his second goal. Philadelphia's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AArron%20Asham"&gt;Arron Asham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; evened the score at five a-piece to complete the period.

The third period was a relatively quiet one, with just 14 shots compared to to 26 and 24 shots in the first two periods, respectively. Each team had 32 shots. Kopecký's goal was the lone action as the &lt;a href="Slovakia"&gt;Slovak&lt;/a&gt; national slipped the puck past Flyers goalkeeper &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABrian%20Boucher"&gt;Brian Boucher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who had 11 saves in 24 minutes on the ice. Boucher replaced &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Leighton"&gt;Michael Leighton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who stopped 15 of 20 shots. Blackhawk counterpart &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAntti%20Niemi"&gt;Antti Niemi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; collected 27 of 32 shots.

The game was the Blackhawks' first Finals victory since 1973. In 1992, they were swept by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APittsburg%20Penguins"&gt;Pittsburg Penguins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Chicago and Philadelphia continue the best-of-seven series on Monday night at Chicago's United Center. The Stanley Cup will determine the 2009-10 National Hockey League champion after the top 16 teams earn the right to compete in the postseason. The NHL has 30 teams in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; and attracts many international players.

&lt;a href="Scotland"&gt;Scottish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIndyCar"&gt;IndyCar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; driver &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADario%20Franchitti"&gt;Dario Franchitti&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; won his second &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIndianapolis%20500"&gt;Indianapolis 500&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in four years today after leading 155 laps, which is the fourth most in the 99-year history of the race. Franchitti, aged 37, also won a rain-shortened race in 2007, when the race was stopped after 166 laps due to the inclement weather and he was declared the winner.

The conditions at this race were far different, with the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Weather%20Service"&gt;National Weather Service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; reporting temperatures of 88° F (31° C) at the track at race time. This temperature made the race the second hottest to the 1932 race, which reached 92° F. 

After a failed attempt to race in the &lt;a href="NASCAR"&gt;NASCAR&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASprint%20Cup"&gt;Sprint Cup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; series in 2008, Franchitti returned to the IndyCar series to race for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChip%20Ganassi%20Racing"&gt;Chip Ganassi Racing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . With this victory, owner Chip Ganassi became the first team owner in racing history to have their drivers win both the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADaytona%20500"&gt;Daytona 500&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the Sprint Cup (won by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJamie%20McMurray"&gt;Jamie McMurray&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) and the Indianapolis 500 in the same year.

"The milk tastes just as good the second time around here," said Franchitti, referring to the ceremonial winner's milk drink following the race. "I just needed to know what the other guys were doing with fuel. There was a gap behind them and a lot of confusion. This means so much after coming back when I went away for a year in 2008 and to come back win a championship and win the Indianapolis 500," he added in an interview in the winner's circle.

Franchitti won the race on less than a tenth of a gallon of fuel, after he and his team decided to not pit during the final laps of the race. The race ended on a caution after a massive crash between drivers &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Conway"&gt;Mike Conway&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Hunter-Reay"&gt;Ryan Hunter-Reay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , when Conway's car got caught onto Hunter-Reay's left outside wheel and was sent airborne. Conway's car then hit the track's retaining wall and landed on its front side. Medics took Conway out of the car, and he was taken to the hospital with a leg injury.

Finishing behind Franchitti in second place was &lt;a href="England"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; driver &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADan%20Wheldon"&gt;Dan Wheldon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APartner%20Racing"&gt;Partner Racing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . This was Wheldon's second straight second place finish. In third place was &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMarco%20Andretti"&gt;Marco Andretti&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who started in sixteenth position.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMaffra%2C%20Victoria"&gt;Maffra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; defeated Leongatha by six goals to take the outright top spot on the Gippsland Football League ladder, ahead of their round eight top of the table &lt;a href="Gippsland%20Football%20League"&gt;Gippsland Football League&lt;/a&gt; clash against Traralgon. Traralgon had a bye in round seven.

Playing at the Leongatha Recreation Reserve, the hosts and last year's semi-finalists never led Maffra, the 2009 premiers. Maffra led by seven points at the end of the first quarter, three points at half time, and nine points at the end of the third quarter.

Goals to Kal Killoran, who's back from interleague, David Adams, Heyden Burgiel, Nicholas Horsford, Samual Bullen, Sam Bedggood, Joshua Stubbe, Daniel Stubbe (2) and Gary Jones (4) sealed the win for Maffra.

Hayden Browne, Clinton Johnston, Matthew Willcocks (2), Tom Marriott (2), Sam Sperling (2) and Dwayne Holt (2) were the goal kickers for Leongatha.

The Gippsland Football League is an Australian rules football league covering the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGippsland"&gt;Gippsland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; region of the Australian state of &lt;a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt;. It is officially known as the Gippsland League.

<h1>News briefs:May 30, 2010</h1>
<h2>Promo</h2>

Today on Wikinews : Statues of Democracy removed in Hong Kong, Canada keep an eye on Deepwater Horizon spill, 30 die in a bus crash in India, Israel declines appeals to sign Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, Bangledesh's government blocks Facebook, BP fails to block the oil leak and a Guatamalan journalist dies covering the Pacayan volcano.

Today is Saturday, May 29th, 2010. I'm Patrick Gillett and this is Wikinews.

<h2>Script</h2>

<h3>&lt;a href="Canada%20keeping%20eye%20on%20Deepwater%20Horizon%20spill"&gt;Canada keeping eye on Deepwater Horizon spill&lt;/a&gt;</h3>
The Canadian Government is watching the "slowing growth" of the BP oil spill.

Canada is running their dash-8 on a twice a day mission to the gulf, monitoring for signs that the BP Oil slick may expand up the Eastern seaboard into Canadian waters, and to provide assistance to US efforts to contain the spill. This started in May, and is expected to continue until the spill has been fully contained, or no longer needed. Canada has also provided technical experts, research and development teams, and general staffing to assist in spill containment and cleanup.

While the risk is slim that the oil slick will move up the seaboard enough to get into Canadian waters, it is possible. Currently the spill is being held within the Gulf of Mexico, however, as the spill grows each day it is at bigger risk of being picked up by the Loop Current.

"If oil is swept up into the Loop Current—which moves at about 3.3 to 6.5 feet (one to two meters) a second—there's essentially no way to stop it," Tony Sturges, professor emeritus of oceanography at Florida State University, told National Geographic. "Once [oil] gets into the loop current, you can bet the farm it will go around to the south"

After being picked up by the Loop Current, the oil spill could then quickly be carried further by the Gulf Stream, which can travel up to 2.5 metres per second (5.6 mph). This current leads right through some of Canada's best fishing waters, and could potentially even be washed up directly onto the shores of Canada, if not properly contained.

This spill could devastate the fishing industry of Canada, and harm any potential tourism on the beautiful coastal waters of Eastern Canada. So while Canada is offering its hand to the United States as a gesture of assistance, it serves dually as a self assurance that Canada will not be affected by the spill, and to stop it before it reaches the border if it does get picked up by the currents.

<h3>&lt;a href="Facebook%20blocked%20in%20Bangladesh"&gt;Facebook blocked in Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;</h3>
Bangladesh temporarily blocked the social networking site Facebook on Saturday, after a man was arrested for uploading content onto it deemed offensive. Other users had reportedly posted other kinds of potentially offensive content, including anti-religious and pornographic materials.

Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) arrested Mahbub Alam Rodin, aged 30, in charges of uploading cartoons of some political leaders on the website. Rodin's activity on Facebook was classified as "offensive", said Commander Mohammad Sohail, director of RAB's Legal and Media side, as reported by The Daily Star.

<h3>&lt;a href="Malawi%20President%20pardons%20jailed%20gay%20couple"&gt;Malawi President pardons jailed gay couple&lt;/a&gt;</h3>
The top kill procedure implemented by BP on the leaking Deepwater Horizon oil well on Wednesday has failed. According to David Suttles, BP's chief operating officer, "We have been unable to overcome the flow." Suttles stated that after studying three days of results, BP determined that the procedure was a failure.

On Wednesday, BP began pumping mud into the leaking well, a procedure known as top kill. BP chief executive Tony Howard said it would take at least 24 hours to determine if the procedure was successful. The procedure has worked before in surface situations, but was not previously attempted at 5,000 feet underwater.

The procedure involves pumping heavyweight drilling mud from the surface through a drill pipe, which directs the mud into a manifold lying on the sea bed. From the manifold, the mud is pumped into the blowout preventer, which is sitting on the well.

BP says it pumped 30,000 barrels of mud into the well at rates of up to 80 barrels a minute. After three attempts, the well was still leaking.

The next option, the sixth, is called the Lower Marine Riser Package (LMRP) Cap containment system. This procedure involves a robot using a saw to cut off the leaking pipe and place a cap on the pipe. The LMRP Cap is at the scene and the procedure is expected to take four days to complete.

<h3>&lt;a href="At%20least%20thirty%20dead%20after%20bus%20accident%20in%20India"&gt;At least thirty dead after bus accident in India&lt;/a&gt;</h3>
A bus accident in southern India has left at least thirty people dead — including about ten children — and thirty more injured, according to reports. The incident occurred before dawn in the town of Chitradurga in the Karnataka state. The vehicle, en route to Bangalore, about 200 kilometres from the scene of the accident, drove into a police barricade and flipped over, causing the fuel tank to explode and burn the passengers.

The Press Trust of India news service reports that the driver was among the dead. Senior police officer Labhu Ram also noted that three of those hurt were in serious condition.

Indian police sometimes set up barricades along roads to perform checks; however, some are not clearly marked and not easily discernible in darkness.

Relics dated back to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AQing%20Dynasty"&gt;Qing Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; were found under civil servants' quarters at the ♡❤Rua de D. Belchior Caneiro♡❤ adjacent to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARuins%20of%20St.%20Paul"&gt;The Ruins of St. Paul&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;a href="Macau"&gt;Macau&lt;/a&gt; by archaeological teams at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.

Since St Paul's College is believed to have been located under those quarters, the Macau government will demolish them in order to cope with the experts' findings at the Ruins of St. Paul. The two blocks closer to the Ruins of St. Paul were demolished in March to make room for the archaeological project.

The relics included Chinese-styled &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aporcelain"&gt;porcelain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; tiles, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aeave"&gt;eave&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; tiles, potteries and iron artillery shells. Furthermore, a part of an ancient wall is found at a nearby construction site.

The walls are confirmed as parts of the Ruins of St. Paul as it does match the maps of it dated back to 1760, 1886, and 1912. By examining the walls, it is proved that the wall was constructed of at least five layers of stone, with layers of blue bricks on top of them, as well as rammed earth each measuring at least ten centimeters thick. 

The remaining two buildings will be demolished next week for further investigation.

<h2>Script</h2>
<h3>&lt;a href="Nineteen%20activists%20killed%20by%20Israeli%20commandos%20aboard%20aid%20convoy%20bound%20for%20Gaza"&gt;Nineteen activists killed by Israeli commandos aboard aid convoy bound for Gaza&lt;/a&gt; (0:38)</h3>

Around nineteen Free Gaza Movement activists died today when Israeli Defense Force commandos boarded vessels in international waters attempting to break the Israeli blockade of Gaza. According to Israeli television, 19 people were killed and 36 wounded in the confrontation, although Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave a toll of at least 10.

The six vessels, called the Gaza Freedom Flotilla, carried 10,000 tonnes of humanitarian aid destined for the Gaza Strip, including water purifiers, prefabricated homes and medical equipment. Passengers included several European members of parliament from Germany, Belgium, Algeria and Israel. Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon said that the organizers of the Gaza aid flotilla have connections to organizations such as Hamas and al-Qaeda. 

The Israeli military had declared it would not allow the ships to reach Gaza and said the activists were a "provocation intended to delegitimise Israel". The Israeli Navy had been transmitting messages throughout the night ordering them to turn back, stating that if the order was ignored: "the Israeli navy will be forced to take all the necessary measures in order to enforce this blockade".

Huwaida Arraf, one of the organizers, had said that the flotilla was "fully prepared for the different scenarios" that might arise, and organizers were hopeful that Israeli authorities would "do what's right" and not stop the convoy. She said, "we fully intend to go to Gaza regardless of any intimidation of threats of violence against us," and that "they are going to have to forcefully stop us."

The pre-dawn boarding took place in international waters around 150 kilometers (90 miles) off the coast of Gaza. Footage from on the flotilla's lead vessel, the Mavi Marmara, showed armed Israeli soldiers boarding the ship from helicopters and fighting with activists. According to the Israel Defense Forces, the activists attacked the commandos with batons, knives and axes. Benjamin Netanyahu said "they were mobbed. They were clubbed, they were beaten, stabbed. There was even a report of gunfire and our soldiers had to defend themselves, defend their lives or they would have been killed."

A spokesman for the flotilla, Greta Berlin accused Israeli troops of indiscriminately shooting at "unarmed civilians", however, Israel said troops found weapons aboard the Gaza flotilla which were used against the IDF. Egypt's foreign minister and the foundation for Human Rights and Freedom and Humanitarian Relief who helped to organize the convoy denied that there were weapons aboard.

Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-Moon said he was "shocked by reports of killings and injuries of people on boats carrying supplies for Gaza" and called for "a full investigation to determine exactly how this bloodshed took place" and urged Israel to "urgently provide a full explanation". Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas' called for three days of mourning to commemorate what he called the "slaughter" of protesters. Ismail Haniya, the Hamas leader in Gaza, has dubbed the Israeli action as "a crime".

Turkey's prime minister describes the Israeli raid as 'state terrorism' and said Israel violated international laws. Some of the ships were sailing under Turkish flags and media reports indicate that Turkish nationals are among the dead. Turkey demanded an "urgent explanation" from Israel and warned of "irreparable consequences" after the incident. Turkey is withdrawing its ambassador to Israel and is calling on the U.N. Security Council to convene in an emergency session about Israel.

The European Union's foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, has called on Israeli authorities to launch a "full inquiry" into the killing, Germany's Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said he was "deeply concerned" and France said "nothing can justify" the incident. Sweden, Austria, Greece and Spain have said it was important to "quickly establish" what happened, and have summoned the Israeli ambassadors. The British Foreign Secretary William Hague has called on the Government of Israel to open all crossings for aid to enter Gaza and the White House said that the United States "deeply regrets" the loss of life and injuries and was working to understand the circumstances surrounding this "tragedy."

Russia has called attention to the fact that the Israeli interception of a Gaza-bound international aid flotilla took place in international waters, which it said represents a gross violation of international law. 

Another attempt to break the Israeli blockade of Gaza in 2 or 3 days will be made by the Irish vessel MV Rachel Corrie and the Irish Prime Minister said that “The cause of this problem relates directly to the fact that there is a humanitarian blockade."

<h3>&lt;a href="Seven%20policemen%20killed%20in%20Afghanistan%20after%20bomb%20explosion"&gt;Seven policemen killed in Afghanistan after bomb explosion&lt;/a&gt; (6:22)</h3>

At least seven policemen were killed in northeastern Afghanistan yesterday, according to reports, after a bomb went off near a police patrol vehicle.

The incident occurred in the Darayim district within the province of Badakhshan, considered to be the least violent province in the country.

Another policeman was injured, and subsequently evacuated to a provincial hospital; deputy provincial governor Shams-Ul Rahman Shams said his condition is apparently critical. Afghan Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid claimed responsibility for the attack.

Meanwhile, in a separate incident, an Afghan army convoy full of soldiers struck upon another roadside bomb in Nangarhar, killing a further three people.

Tragedy also struck in Cameroon where

<h3>&lt;a href="Dozens%20dead%20after%20bus%20accident%20in%20Cameroon"&gt;Dozens dead after bus accident in Cameroon&lt;/a&gt; (7:09)</h3>

at least thirty people are dead after a bus rolled over on Saturday near the city of Bafia, 135 kilometers north of the capital Yaounde.

Traffic police official Fifen Idrissou told the Agence France-Presse news service: "At the scene we've identified around 30 bodies but the death toll could be much greater given that some of the injured evacuated before we arrived reportedly died." In describing the accident, he said "the bus lost control [...] 200 meters further on the bus hit a ditch. It rolled over several times".

It wasn't immediately clear how many people were aboard the bus when it crashed.

In keeping up with the latest geological activity on the planet, 

<h3>&lt;a href="6.4%20magnitude%20earthquake%20rocks%20Andaman%20Islands"&gt;6.4 magnitude earthquake rocks Andaman Islands&lt;/a&gt; (7:52)</h3>

a 6.4 magnitude earthquake hit the Andaman Islands, located in the Bay of the Bengal, India, today at 1:21 AM local time. The earthquake had a depth of 127.7 kilometers and the epicenter was located 120 kilometers at the southeast of Port Blair, the largest town and a municipal council on the Andaman Islands. No casualties or damage has been reported, and no tsunami alert was issued.

Finally, in motor-sports, 

<h3>&lt;a href="Scot%20Dario%20Franchitti%20wins%20Indianapolis%20500"&gt;Scot Dario Franchitti wins Indianapolis 500&lt;/a&gt; (8:26)</h3>

Scottish IndyCar driver Dario Franchitti won his second Indianapolis 500 in four years Sunday after leading 155 laps, which is the fourth most in the 99-year history of the race. Franchitti, aged 37, also won a rain-shortened race in 2007, when the race was stopped after 166 laps.

After a failed attempt to race in the NASCAR Sprint Cup series in 2008, Franchitti returned to the IndyCar series to race for Chip Ganassi Racing. With this victory, owner Chip Ganassi became the first team owner in racing history to have a driver win both the Daytona 500 of the Sprint Cup and the Indianapolis 500. On February 14, Jamie McMurray won the Daytona 500 driving for a Ganassi team and just hours after Franchitti took the checkered flag and had the ceremonial winner's milk drink, Jamie McMurray took second at the NASCAR Coca Cola 500, just 1 second behind Kurt Busch.

Franchitti won the race on less than a tenth of a gallon of fuel, after he and his team decided to not pit during the final laps of the race. The race ended on a caution after a massive crash between drivers Mike Conway and Ryan Hunter-Reay, when Conway's car got caught onto Hunter-Reay's left outside wheel and was sent airborne. Conway's car then hit the track's retaining wall and landed on its front side. Medics took Conway out of the car, and he was taken to the hospital with a leg injury.

Finishing behind Franchitti in second place was British driver Dan Wheldon of Partner Racing. This was Wheldon's second straight second place finish. In third place was Marco Andretti, who started in sixteenth position. Other notable finishes were Scott Dixon taking 5th, Danica Patrick placing 6th and Helio Castroneves at 9th.'

In 1669, citing poor eyesight, English naval administrator and Member of Parliament Samuel Pepys recorded the last entry in his diary, one of the most important primary sources for the English Restoration period.

Pepys was born on Fleet Street in London in 1633 to his father John, a tailor, and his mother Margaret who was the daughter of a Whitechapel butcher. He was fifth of 11 children but child mortality in the age was high and he was soon the eldest. 

From a young age, Pepys suffered from kidney stones in his urinary tract and he was almost never without pain, as well as other symptoms, including "blood in the urine". By the time of his marriage, the condition was very severe and probably had a serious effect on his ability to engage in sexual intercourse.

In 1657, Pepys decided to undergo surgery and upon consulting Thomas Hollier, a surgeon; on 26 March 1658, his operation took place in a bedroom at the house of Pepys's cousin, Jane Turner. This cannot have been an easy option, as the operation was known to be especially painful as well as hazardous, not to mention it would be roughly 200 more years before the use of anesthesia, however, Pepys' stone was successfully removed and he resolved to hold a celebration on every anniversary of the operation, which he did for several years. There were long-term effects from the operation: the incision on his bladder broke open again late in his life, and the procedure may have left him sterile – though there is no direct evidence for this, as he was childless before the operation.

Though his immediate family was of humble origins, his father's first cousin, Sir Richard Pepys, was a member of parliament for Sudbury and for a time Samuel lived with another of his father's cousins, Sir Edward Montagu, who would later be made 1st Earl of Sandwich. Possibly this combination of a hard working, middle class upbringing and influential connections allowed Pepys, who had no maritime experience, to rise by patronage, hard work and his talent for administration, to be the Chief Secretary to the Admiralty under both King Charles II and subsequently King James II.

What sets Pepys apart in history, however, is his diary. Beginning on January 1st, 1660, he recorded his daily life the women he pursued, his friends and his dealings for almost ten years. His diary reveals his jealousies, insecurities, trivial concerns, and his fractious relationship with his wife, Elisabeth de St Michel, a descendant of French Protestant immigrants, whom he married when she was 14 years old. The diary is an important account of London in the 1660s and the juxtaposition of his commentary on politics and national events, alongside the very personal, can be seen from the beginning.

Robert Latham, the editor of the definitive edition of the diary, has remarked that 'His descriptions of the Great Plague of 1665, and of the Great Fire of London in 1666 are agonizingly vivid and achieve their effect by being something more than superlative reporting; they are written with compassion. As always with Pepys it is people, not literary effects, that matter.

His account of the Great Fire of London is quite vivid as he had taken a boat and observed the fire for over an hour. In his diary, Pepys recorded this observation on Sunday, September 2nd 1666 :

"And among other things, the poor pigeons, I perceive, were loth to leave their houses, but hovered about the windows and balconys till they were, some of them burned, their wings, and fell down. Having staid, and in an hour's time seen the fire: rage every way, and nobody, to my sight, endeavouring to quench it, but to remove their goods, and leave all to the fire, and having seen it get as far as the Steele-yard, and the wind mighty high and driving it into the City; and every thing, after so long a drought, proving combustible, even the very stones of churches, and among other things the poor steeple by which pretty Mrs.————lives, and whereof my old school-fellow Elborough is parson, taken fire in the very top, an there burned till it fell down"

Pepy's was, after all, also very human and he engaged in a number of extramarital liaisons with various women, which he too chronicled in his diary, often in some detail, and generally using a cocktail of languages (English, French, Spanish and Latin) when relating the intimate details. The most dramatic of these encounters was with Deborah Willet, a young woman engaged as a companion for his wife, Elisabeth. On 25 October 1668 Pepys was surprised by his wife whilst embracing Deborah and he writes that Elisabeth "coming up suddenly, did find me imbracing the girl con my hand sub su coats; and endeed I was with my main in her cunny. I was at a wonderful loss upon it and the girl also..." Following this event, he was characteristically filled with remorse but (equally characteristically) this did not prevent his continuing to pursue Willet when she had been dismissed from the Pepys household.

From June–October 1669, Pepys and his wife took a holiday to France and the Low Countries but on their return, Elisabeth fell ill and died on 10 November 1669. Pepys erected a monument to her in the church of St Olave's, Hart Street, in London.

Throughout the period of the diary, Pepys's health suffered from the long hours he worked. Specifically, he believed that his eyesight had been affected by the work he had done. At the end of May 1669, he reluctantly concluded that, for the sake of his eyes, he should completely stop writing and, from then on, only dictate to his clerks which meant he could no longer keep his diary. 

However, he remained quite active and in 1673, he was promoted to Secretary to the Admiralty Commission and elected Member of Parliament for Castle Rising in Norfolk. In 1683 he was sent to Tangier to assist Lord Dartmouth with the evacuation and abandonment of the English colony and during his time as a Fellow of the Royal Society, Isaac Newton's Principia Mathematica was published and its title-page bears Pepys' name. During a correspondence between Newton and Pepys, arose the "Newton–Pepys problem" which whether one is more likely to roll at least one six with six dice or at least two sixes with twelve dice. It has been only recently noted that while the gambling advice Newton gave Pepys was correct, the logical argument Newton included with it was unsound.

On May 26, 1703 Pepys died at a house at Clapham owned by his friend William Hewer but his diary, as well as 3,000 volumes of his personal library, still one of the most important surviving 17th century private libraries, is on display at the Pepys Library of Magdalene College, Cambridge.

In &lt;a href="ice%20hockey"&gt;ice hockey&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChicago%20Blackhawks"&gt;Chicago Blackhawks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; scored two goals just 28 seconds apart late in the second period to take a 2–0 series lead over the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APhiladelphia%20Flyers"&gt;Philadelphia Flyers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in Game 2 of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2010%20Stanley%20Cup%20Finals"&gt;2010 Stanley Cup Finals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Monday night in &lt;a href="Chicago"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMari%C3%A1n%20Hossa"&gt;Marián Hossa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; scored Chicago's first goal at the 17:09 mark of the second period on slap shot deep in the Blackhawk's defensive zone. Left-wingers &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATroy%20Brouwer"&gt;Troy Brouwer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Sharp"&gt;Patrick Sharp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; provided assists on the goal.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABen%20Eager"&gt;Ben Eager&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; scored the game-winner at the 17:37 mark of the second period on a feed from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADustin%20Byfuglien"&gt;Dustin Byfuglien&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Eager scored his goal on a wrist shot from 38 feet.

Philadelphia's lone goal came in the third period, when &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASimon%20Gagn%C3%A9"&gt;Simon Gagné&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; scored at the 5:20 mark. Centers &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Richards"&gt;Mike Richards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJeff%20Carter"&gt;Jeff Carter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; provides assists on the goal.

Unlike the , this one was marked by impressive defensive efforts from both sides. Chicago goalkeeper &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAntti%20Niemi"&gt;Antti Niemi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; made 32 saves, earning the Player-of-the-Game honor from the National Hockey League. His counterpart, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Leighton"&gt;Michael Leighton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; who was pulled in Game 1 after giving up five goals, collected 24 saves.

"It's unbelievable feeling how the people react," Niemi said after the game, according to the Associated Press. "Defense was the key."

Flyers coach &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Laviolette"&gt;Peter Laviolette&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; also acknowledged Niemi, who collected 14 of his 32 saves in the third period.

"I thought their goaltender played extremely well in the third period. We had more than enough looks to tie up that game," Laviolette said, according to the Associated Press.

After a fairly clean game on Saturday, Game 2 had a decided edge, which resulted in ten penalties. Neither team capitalized on their power play opportunities. At the 17:27 mark of the first period, three players were sent off: Chicago's Game 1 hero &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATom%C3%A1%C5%A1%20Kopeck%C3%BD"&gt;Tomáš Kopecký&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for roughing, with Philadelphia's Richards and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Carcillo"&gt;Daniel Carcillo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; going to the box of elbowing and unsportsmanlike conduct, respectively.

Chicago and Philadelphia continue the best-of-seven series on Wednesday night at Philadelphia's Wachovia Center. The Stanley Cup will determine the 2009–10 National Hockey League champion after the top 16 teams earned the right to compete in the postseason. The NHL has 30 teams in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; and attracts many international players.

Former &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVice%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;US Vice President&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="Al%20Gore"&gt;Al Gore&lt;/a&gt; announced earlier today that he would separate from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATipper%20Gore"&gt;Tipper Gore&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , his wife of 40 years. The Gores called the decision "mutual."

In an &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ae-mail"&gt;e-mail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to close friends, Al and Tipper Gore said that they would not make additional comments. The message was confirmed by a spokesperson for the Gore family. A family friend said, "There isn't anyone else. They just want to go their separate ways."

In the e-mail, Al and Tipper Gore said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“We are announcing today that after a great deal of thought we have decided to separate. This is very much a mutual and mutually supportive decision that we have made together, following a process of long and careful consideration. We ask for respect for our privacy and that of our family, and we do not intend to comment further.”
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The announcement was met with surprise in &lt;a href="Washington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; Both were raised around the city, and met at a high school dance. 62-year-old Al Gore was the Vice President of the United States during the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APresidency%20of%20Bill%20Clinton"&gt;Clinton presidency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and lost the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2000%20US%20presidential%20election"&gt;2000 US presidential election&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;. He also received the &lt;a href="Nobel%20Peace%20Prize"&gt;Nobel Peace Prize&lt;/a&gt; for his efforts concerning &lt;a href="climate%20change"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt;. 61-year-old Tipper Gore is a professional photographer and co-founded the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AParents%20Music%20Resource%20Center"&gt;Parents Music Resource Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . On May 19, the couple observed their 40th wedding anniversary. The Gores have four children.

&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASamantha%20Stosur"&gt;Samantha Stosur&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; will compete against &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFrancesca%20Schiavone"&gt;Francesca Schiavone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for the women's title in this year's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFrench%20Open"&gt;French Open&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , while &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASpain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARafael%20Nadal"&gt;Rafael Nadal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; will go up against &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARobin%20Soderling"&gt;Robin Soderling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

In the women's semifinals, Stosur easily defeated &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJelena%20Jankovic"&gt;Jelena Jankovic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , once &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20WTA%20number%201%20ranked%20players"&gt;number one in the world&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , while Schiavone's opponent &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AElena%20Dementieva"&gt;Elena Dementieva&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; decided to withdraw due to a torn &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acalf%20muscle"&gt;calf muscle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; after losing one set to Schiavone. Stosur and Schiavone will face off at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStade%20Roland%20Garros"&gt;Stade Roland Garros&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; this Saturday for the final round of the French Open. As this is the first &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGrand%20Slam%20%28tennis%29"&gt;Grand Slam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; final for both players, a victory for either will mean her first major championship title. Schiavone is also the first Italian woman to compete in a Grand Slam semifinal match. However, this is not the first time the two have met: Stosur beat Schiavone in the opening round of last year's French Open, and again in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOsaka"&gt;Osaka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; later that year.

This year's championship has been one with several major upsets. None of the top three women in the event, including sisters &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVenus%20Williams"&gt;Venus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASerena%20Williams"&gt;Serena Williams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , made it to the semifinals. In fact, none of the female semifinalists this year have ever won a Grand Slam title, which has not occurred at the French Open for over 30 years.

In a major upset for the men's title, Robin Soderling defeated Swiss player &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARoger%20Federer"&gt;Roger Federer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in a quarterfinal match of the French Open Tuesday, ending Federer's streak of 23 consecutive Grand Slam semifinal appearances. Federer could also lose his status as number one in the world to rival Rafael Nadal if Nadal wins this year's French Open. However, Soderling is known for being the only person to have defeated Nadal in the French Open. In the men's semifinals earlier today, the 24-year-old Nadal beat Austria's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJurgen%20Melzer"&gt;Jurgen Melzer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and Soderling defeated Czech player &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATomas%20Berdych"&gt;Tomas Berdych&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . If Nadal beats Soderling in this Sunday's final round, it will be his fifth French Open title.

&lt;a href="Apple"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; announced Monday that it has sold over two million &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AiPad"&gt;iPads&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , just two months after the device began shipping in the US and only days after its international launch.

Apple shares rose 2.9 percent (&lt;a href="US%24"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;7.41) to US$264.29 Tuesday afternoon. Market analysts also upped price targets and sales estimates in response to the announcement. Shares for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAT%26amp%3BT"&gt;AT&amp;T&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who provides data plans for the iPad, also rose yesterday.

Prior to the iPad's April 3 launch, many analysts had speculated about the viability and marketability of the device. However, iPad sales have been faster than anticipated. Although it was only expected to sell one million iPads for the whole quarter, Apple announced in early May that it had surpassed the one-million mark in just 28 days. It again surprised industry watchers, who were expecting about 1.6–1.7 million iPads to have been sold when Apple announced that it had passed the two-million mark. iPad sales may make up over ten percent of Apple's revenue this quarter, a feat that took the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AiPhone"&gt;iPhone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; twice as long to achieve. The iPad has been so popular and supplies of the tablet so low that Apple tried to place limits on the number of iPads a person can purchase earlier.

Apple had postponed sales of the iPad to Europe and Asia until last weekend due to strong demand for the tablet in the US. In addition to the US, it now sells the devices in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, Switzerland, and the U.K., and will begin shipping iPads to Austria, Belgium, Hong Kong, Ireland, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, and Singapore in July.

<h1>US Supreme Court relaxes strict interpretation of self incrimination ruling</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=US%20Supreme%20Court%20relaxes%20strict%20interpretation%20of%20self%20incrimination%20ruling&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

In a 5–4 decision on Tuesday, the &lt;a href="US"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; Supreme Court ruled that once a suspect of a criminal investigation is informed of his right to remain silent, he must specifically invoke that right if he does not want his words to be used against him. 
The case involved a fatal shooting in 2000 in &lt;a href="Michigan"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt; committed by Van Chester Thompkins. Before questioning, he was informed of his rights, including the right to remain silent and the right to consult an attorney, but Thompkins did not tell the officer he wished to invoke those rights. During questioning, the suspect gave few, limited responses. After about two hours and forty-five minutes, however, the interrogator asked "Do you pray to God to forgive you for shooting that boy down?" Thompkins replied "yes". Even though he refused to sign a confession, that one-word statement was used against him in trial, and Thompkins was convicted of first-degree murder. 

The conviction was upheld by Michigan state courts and a federal district court, but was overturned by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASixth%20Circuit%20Court%20of%20Appeals"&gt;Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The Supreme Court disagreed and subsequently reinstated the conviction. 

In the case, designated ♡❤Berghuis v. Thompkins♡❤, the high court's conservative majority observed that since he was already informed of his rights, the defendant waived those rights when he voluntarily made an incriminating statement during interrogation. The majority opinion was written by Associate Justice &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAnthony%20Kennedy"&gt;Anthony Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , joined by Chief Justice &lt;a href="John%20Roberts"&gt;John Roberts&lt;/a&gt; and Associate Justices &lt;a href="Antonin%20Scalia"&gt;Antonin Scalia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Clarence%20Thomas"&gt;Clarence Thomas&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASamuel%20Alito"&gt;Samuel Alito&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The court's decision continues a recent trend of siding with the police and restricting the rights of criminal suspects. In her dissenting opinion, Associate Justice &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASonia%20Sotomayor"&gt;Sonia Sotomayor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wrote that the decision is a step back from protections against forced self incrimination as provided for in the landmark 1966 case ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMiranda%20v.%20Arizona"&gt;Miranda v. Arizona&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤. She was joined by the court's other three liberal associate justices: &lt;a href="John%20Paul%20Stevens"&gt;John Paul Stevens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASteven%20Breyer"&gt;Steven Breyer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and &lt;a href="Ruth%20Bader%20Ginsburg"&gt;Ruth Bader Ginsburg&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJetstar%20Airways"&gt;Jetstar Airways&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a &lt;a href="Qantas"&gt;Qantas&lt;/a&gt; owned &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n low-cost airline, has announced plans to trial &lt;a href="Apple"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AiPad"&gt;iPads&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as an in-flight entertainment option. This trial would make Jetstar one of the first airlines in the world to offer the iPad.

Starting later this month, Jetstar plans to begin a two-week trial, during which passengers will have the option to rent iPads for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAU%24"&gt;AU$&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 10 on domestic flights longer than an hour. Thirty iPads would be available on each test plane. These devices would be preloaded with games, e-books, music and video content. Internet access however will be disabled as per Jetstar's policy on internet connected devices, said spokeswoman Andrea Wait. 

The iPads offered by Jetstar, will be specially customized by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;Bluebox Avionics&lt;/span&gt; . Bluebox Avionics, at present, is the only company to offer iPads as part of an in-flight entertainment system. Jetstar will be the first to offer the Bluebox Avionics iPad based systems, though, Bluebox Avionics has said the system will be available to other airlines soon.

Shortly following the initial release of the iPad, Jetstar chief information officer Stephen Tame speculated that the iPad "may lead in the future the end of airline in-flight entertainment systems". Depending on the results of the trial, iPads may replace existing Jetstar in-flight entertainment systems.

Jetstar chief executive Bruce Buchanan said he expected the iPads to be very popular during the trial. If the trial is successful, the airline would “be looking to roll out the devices across our entire domestic and international network later in the year", said Buchanan.

Today on Wikinews : Egypt allows aid to cross into the Gaza strip; ancient Chinese relics are discovered at The Ruins of St. Paul; Patrick Gillett gives us his account of the latest match in the Gippsland Football League and, in history, Yang Yuhuan, beloved consort to Chinese emperor Xuanzong is born.

Today is Tuesday, June 1st, 2010. I'm Dan Harlow and this is Wikinews.
<h2>Script</h2>
<h3>&lt;a href="Egypt%20to%20open%20Gaza%20Strip%20crossing%20for%20humanitarian%20and%20medical%20aid"&gt;Egypt to open Gaza Strip crossing for humanitarian and medical aid&lt;/a&gt; (0:34)</h3>

As United Nations officials have demanded an end to the Gaza blockade, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has ordered the opening of the Rafah Border Crossing into the Gaza Strip allowing for humanitarian and medical aid to pass through. Food and medical supplies will be allowed, but not concrete or steel. It will also be made available for ill and injured Palestinians seeking medical treatment.

Rafah is the only point on the Gaza border not controlled by Israel; a 2005 agreement put both the Palestinian's and Israel in charge of the border, with observation from the European Union.

The opening comes after international criticism of the death of activists when Israeli commandos raided Turkish ships in international waters that were carrying some 10,000 tonnes of supplies and were planning to breach the Gaza blockade. 

<h3>&lt;a href="Relics%20found%20behind%20The%20Ruins%20of%20St.%20Paul%2C%20Macau"&gt;Relics found behind The Ruins of St. Paul, Macau&lt;/a&gt; (1:27)</h3>

Relics dating back to the Qing Dynasty were found under the civil servants' quarters adjacent to The Ruins of St. Paul, a 17th century Portuguese cathedral, in Macau, China by archaeological teams at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.

Since St Paul's College is believed to have been located under those quarters, the Macau government will demolish them in order to assist with the experts' findings at the Ruins of St. Paul. A 2 block area around the cite was already demolished in March to make room for the archaeological project.

The relics included Chinese-styled porcelain tiles, eave tiles, potteries and iron artillery shells. Furthermore, part of an ancient wall was found at a nearby construction site.

The walls are confirmed as part of the Ruins of St. Paul, matching maps dating back to 1760, 1886 and 1912. Examinations of the walls have shown they were constructed with at least by 5 layers of stone, on top of them 2 layers of blue bricks, as well as rammed earth each measuring at least 10 centimeters thick.

The remaining 2 buildings in the area will be demolished next week for further investigation.

In our continuing coverage of the Gippsland Football League, we have a special report from Wikinews reporter Patrick Gillett on the latest standings in the league.

<h3>(2:38)</h3>

Thank you, Pat.

Now, moving from football to ice hockey, 

<h3>(3:17)</h3>

the Chicago Blackhawks scored two goals just 28 seconds apart late in the second period to take a 2–0 series lead over the Philadelphia Flyers in Game 2 of the 2010 Stanley Cup Finals Monday night in Chicago, United States.

Ben Eager scored the game-winner on a wrist shot from 38 feet at the 17:37 mark of the second period.

Unlike the first game, this one was marked by impressive defensive efforts from both sides. Chicago goalkeeper Antti Niemi made 32 saves, earning the Player-of-the-Game honor from the National Hockey League. His counterpart, Michael Leighton, who was pulled in Game 1 after giving up five goals, collected 24 saves.

Chicago and Philadelphia will continue their best-of-seven series on Wednesday night at Philadelphia's Wachovia Center.

In 719, one of the Four Great Beauties of ancient China is born; her name is Consort Yang Yuhuan. 

In her era, Yang was known for having a full and fleshy figure, which was a much sought-after quality at the time, but must not be viewed in the modern context of someone who is extremely overweight. Her story too is quite beautiful but as with each of the Four Great Beauties who gained their reputation from the influence they exercised over kings and emperors three of the Four Beauties brought kingdoms to their knees, and the lives of all four ended in tragic or under mysterious circumstances.

Yang Yuhuan was born early in the reign of her future husband Emperor Xuanzong, the seventh and longest reigning emperor of the Tang dynasty in China. Her father served as a census official at Shu Prefecture and appeared to be sonless, but he had four daughters, all known to history and who were also beautiful. Yet her father died when she was still young and so she was raised by her uncle who was a low-level official at Henan Municipality.

In 733, Yang Yuhuan married the son of Emperor Xuanzong and Consort Wu, Li Mao the Prince of Shou when she was 16. She thus carried the title of Princess of Shou but after Consort Wu died in 737, Emperor Xuanzong was greatly saddened by the death of his then-favorite concubine. Though it is unknown how, Princess Yang somehow came into the Emperor's favor and he decided to take her as his own consort. 

However, since Princess Yang was already the wife of his son, Emperor Xuanzong stealthily arranged her to become a Taoist nun in order to prevent criticisms that would affect his plan of making her his concubine. Yang then stayed, for a brief time, as a Taoist nun in the palace before Emperor Xuanzong made her an imperial consort after bestowing his son Li Mao a new wife, the daughter of a general. Yang hence became the favorite consort of the emperor like Consort Wu before her.

Yang Yuhuan was held in such high esteem as consort by the emperor that he created a new rank of Guifei, which was even greater than the previously highest rank of Huifei, held by Consort Wu. He also bestowed posthumous honors on her father and gave high offices to the uncle who had raised her. Her three sisters were each made Ladies of Han and it was said that whenever the noble women were summoned to imperial gatherings, even Emperor Xuanzong's highly honored sister, the Princess Yuzhen, did not dare to take a seat more honorable than theirs.

Consort Yang became so favored that whenever she rode a horse, the powerful eunuch Gao Lishi, believed to have been richer than many of the nobility of the era, would personally attend to her. 700 laborers were conscripted to sew fabrics for her and officials and generals flattered her by offering her exquisite tributes.

Apparently, having a strong willed personality, in 746, there was an occasion when she angered the Emperor by being jealous and rude to him, and he had her sent to her cousin's mansion. However, later that day, his mood was such that he could not eat, and the servants were battered by him for minor offenses. Gao Lishi knew that he missed Consort Yang, and Gao requested that the treasures in Consort Yang's palace be sent to her. The Emperor agreed and even added that imperial meals be sent to her. That night, Gao requested that the Emperor welcome Consort Yang back to the palace, a request he easily agreed to. Thereafter, she was even more favored, and no other imperial consort drew more favor from the Emperor.

4 years later, she once again offended the Emperor, who at first sent her away, then regretted the decision, sent her imperial meals once more and as she ate, she cried to the eunuchs delivering the meal, stating:

"My offense deserves death, and it is fortunate that His Imperial Majesty did not kill me, but instead returned me to my household. I will forever leave the palace. My gold, jade, and treasures were all given me by His Imperial Majesty, and it would be inappropriate for me to offer them back to him. Only what my parents gave me I would dare to offer."

She cut off some of her hair and had the hair taken back to Emperor Xuanzong. Emperor Xuanzong had Gao escort her back to the palace, and thereafter loved her even greater.

Her influence and cunning had become so great that in 752, when her powerful cousin Yang Guozhong was requested to defend against an attack in what is now modern day Chengdu, Sichuan, she interceded on his behalf, and the requesting chancellor soon died, allowing Yang Guozhong to become the new chancellor. 

Yet her cousin and another powerful military commander, An Lushan, were soon in conflict with each other and when Yang Guozhong provoked his rival into rebelling, the situation became so dire in the region that the Emperor considered abdicating the throne to an enemy of Yang Guozhong but Consort Yang intervened again and the emperor relented.

Unfortunately the situation grew worse and soon An Lushan had the upper hand militarily forcing the emperor to personally escort Yang Guozhong as he fled towards Chengdu. On 15 July, 756, the emperors imperial guards became angry that they had not been fed, and, fearing Yang Guozhong was planning treason, attacked and killed him. The soldiers then surrounded Emperor Xuanzong's pavilion and demanded that Consort Yang also be put to death believing her enormous influence with the emperor had created the situation in the first place. The the emperor initially declined, Gao Lishi, the powerful eunuch, changed the emperor's mind and so Gao Lishi took her to a Buddhist shrine and strangled her. 

Consort Yang was buried without a coffin, but instead with masses of fragrances and was wrapped in purple blankets. A year later, the emperor wanted to locate her body and rebury her with honor but was advised against doing so. Yet secretly he sent eunuchs to rebury her with a coffin. When they found the body, it had decomposed, but the fragrance bag buried with her was still fresh. When the eunuchs returned with the fragrance bag and presented it to the emperor, he wept bitterly.

In the following generation, a long poem, "Song of the Everlasting Sorrow" was written by the poet Bai Juyi describing the Emperor's love for her and perpetual grief at her loss. It became an instant classic, known to and memorized by Chinese schoolchildren far into posterity. The poem also became highly popular in Japan and served as sources of inspiration for the classical novel The Tale of Genji which begins with the doomed love between an emperor and a consort who is likened to Consort Yang.

A Japanese rumor states that Lady Yang may have even been rescued, escaping to Japan and lived her remaining life there.

Police have found the body of a man they had been hunting in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACumbria"&gt;Cumbria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; for a series of shootings. Police later confirmed that twelve people had been killed with a further thirteen injured, three critically. Shots were fired in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWhitehaven"&gt;Whitehaven&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASeascale"&gt;Seascale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEgremont%2C%20Cumbria"&gt;Egremont&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , with a total of thirty different crime scenes. The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASellafield"&gt;Sellafield&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; nuclear reprocessing plant was locked down for the first time in its history. 

The prime suspect was named as 52 year old local man Derrick Bird, a taxi driver. The first of Bird's victims was a fellow taxi driver shot in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWhitehaven"&gt;Whitehaven&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at about 10.30 local time, with the following victims being shot at random as Bird drove down the west coast. Originally driving a Citroën Picasso, he was later said to be on foot when he crashed his vehicle. 

Members of the public were advised by police to stay indoors, and for those who saw him not to approach him, but to call them. The manhunt covered the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABoot%2C%20Cumbria"&gt;Boot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AScafell%20Pike"&gt;Scafell Pike&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; area, and at 14:04 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABST"&gt;BST&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (13:04 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) the Deputy Chief Constable of Cumbria reported that a body believed to be Bird was found in a wood near Boot with a firearm, and that he had turned the weapon on himself.

The affected area is popular with walkers and hikers, and currently, many schools across &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; are on half term, meaning the pupils have no classes.

British news network &lt;a href="BBC%20News"&gt;BBC News&lt;/a&gt; spoke to several eye-witnesses in relation to the incidents, from each of the areas, including Peter Watson of Whitehaven. "When I first got here it must have just happened. There was a man lying on the ground with police stood over him and a jacket on him," he reported.

Home Secretary &lt;a href="Theresa%20May"&gt;Theresa May&lt;/a&gt; is due to make a statement on the incident to the House of Commons tomorrow.

A &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AClaude%20Giroux%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;Claude Giroux&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; goal 5:59 into the overtime period of play lifted the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APhiladelphia%20Flyers"&gt;Philadelphia Flyers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to a 4–3 victory over the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChicago%20Blackhawks"&gt;Chicago Blackhawks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in Game 3 of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2010%20Stanley%20Cup%20Finals"&gt;2010 Stanley Cup Finals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Wednesday night in Philadelphia, &lt;a href="Pennsylvania"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; in the eastern &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. The Flyers victory cuts the Blackhawks' series lead to 2–1.

Giroux's goal came on a redirection off &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMatt%20Carle"&gt;Matt Carle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's pass, squeezing the through the right arm and leg of Blackhawks goalie &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAntti%20Niemi%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;Antti Niemi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

"I tried to get a stick on it, and it just trickled in," Giroux said. "Our line started playing well, so anytime your line's going you just play better I think. The whole team just showed up tonight, and we really wanted that win.

"Desperation was the key word, I think. It's almost do or die."

Like the first two games, this one was decided by a one-goal margin, but was not as loose as the 6–5 Game 1 or tight as the 2–1 Game 2.

The Flyers hit first — converting on their first power play chance — when right-winger &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Bri%C3%A8re"&gt;Danny Brière&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who had been drifting deep in the offensive zone took a pass just in front of the net and put it past Niemi at the 14:58 mark of the first period. Leading up to the play, Blackhawk &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMari%C3%A1n%20Hossa"&gt;Marián Hossa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has been sent to the penalty box for slashing, breaking the stick of a Flyers player. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AScott%20Hartnell"&gt;Scott Hartnell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABraydon%20Coburn"&gt;Braydon Coburn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; provided assists on the play.

Chicago started the second period at a disadvantage after &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADustin%20Byfuglien"&gt;Dustin Byfuglien&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was sent off for roughing after a scuffle involving teammate &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Kane"&gt;Patrick Kane&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and Flyer &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKimmo%20Timonen"&gt;Kimmo Timonen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at the end of the first period. The Flyers could not take advantage as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Richards"&gt;Mike Richards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; missed two great chances. The Blackhawks went right back down the ice and scored less than a minute after Byfuglien's penalty expired, with a Duncan Keith shot from midway into the offensive zone at the 2:49 mark. Kane and Hossa had assists on the play.

A Dustin Byfuglien penalty for slashing at 9:31 led to a Flyers power play. In the power play, a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Pronger"&gt;Chris Pronger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; shot sent the arena into a frenzy as both the goal light and the arena horn went off, but the game officials did not award the goal to the Flyers. After a further 1:26 of game time, play finally stopped after an icing call. After a video review, officials awarded Philadelphia's Scott Hartnell the goal.

After a stoppage in play, John Madden won the puck and passed it back to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABrent%20Sopel"&gt;Brent Sopel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who shot a one-timer from the point into the far corner of the net to tie the game at the 17:52 mark of the second period.

The third period began with a goal-scoring flurry. With less than three minutes gone in the period, Kane scored a breakaway goal for Chicago at the 2:50 mark. Just 20 seconds later, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVille%20Leino"&gt;Ville Leino&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; collected a rebound off goalkeeper Niemi's pad to tie the game. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJonathan%20Toews"&gt;Jonathan Toews&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABen%20Eager"&gt;Ben Eager&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; collected assists on the Chicago goal, while Giroux collected the assist on Philadelphia's goal. The goals were the only two of the third period and the game went to overtime.

At the 5:03 mark of the overtime period, a Flyers shot hit off the goal post and trickled down the line and before Niemi was able to secure the puck briefly. The arena staff blew the horn signaling a home goal before the puck was secured. A Flyers player managed to knock the puck into the back of the net, but upon video review, a no-goal was awarded with the game officials determining that the whistle signaling stoppage of play had been blown before the puck had been knocked loose. The respite for Chicago was brief as Giroux's goal came just 56 seconds later.

Immediately after the game, Flyers captain Mike Richards told CBC Sports that the game-winning goal was a big relief to the team.

"We came out and played hard," Richards said. "Both teams played extremely well and we were lucky to get the last goal."

As for the goal that was called off in overtime, Richards said that the Flyers players did not really hear the whistle.

Niemi and Flyers counterpart &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Leighton"&gt;Michael Leighton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; had 28 and 24 saves respectively.

Both teams had three power-play opportunities, all six of which occurred in the first two periods of play. Philadelphia was two for three in those chances while Chicago did not convert any.

Chicago and Philadelphia continue the best-of-seven series on Friday night at Philadelphia's Wachovia Center. The Stanley Cup will determine the 2009–10 National Hockey League champion after the top 16 teams earned the right to compete in the postseason. The NHL has 30 teams in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; and attracts many international players.

Maffra were a game clear going into this games thaks to Traralgon having a bye the week before. Both teams have one loss on there records, Maffra to Sale by one point and Traralgon to Leongatha.

According to last Thursday's Latrobe Valley Express, Traralgon's Rohan Hore was expected to come back into the senior side.

<h3>Around the Grounds</h3>

<h3>Match</h3>
Despite leading at quarter time, Traralgon could not go on with the job tailing at the long break by five goals and at the end of the third quarter, seemingly puting the pressure back on Maffra, by two and a half goals - fifteen points.

For the first quarter, Traralgon doubled Maffra's centre clearances and were ahead on inside fifties. They kicked three goals and three behinds to Maffra's two goals and two behinds.

Despite not letting Maffra run away with the reversal of these stats, indicating what could be argued a good contest, Traralgon could only kick three more goals for the match, all in the third quarter.

Final scores - Maffra going two games clear at home 15-11 101 to Traralgon 6-13 49.

Today on Wikinews : Israel plans to release all remaining activists from the Gaza incident; twelve people are killed in the UK during a series of violent shootings; Al and Tipper Gore decided to end their marriage and, in history, Rome is sacked - again.

<h2>Script</h2>
<h3>&lt;a href="Israel%20may%20free%20all%20Gaza%20flotilla%20detainees"&gt;Israel may free all Gaza flotilla detainees&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Israel%20to%20release%20activists%20arrested%20in%20flotilla%20raid"&gt;Israel to release activists arrested in flotilla raid&lt;/a&gt; (0:32)</h3>

Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu has decided that Israel will not prosecute or continue to hold the activists it captured from the six ship "Gaza Freedom flotilla", seized in the Gaza flotilla raid by Israeli naval forces in international waters. Israel plans to release all of the activists it arrested in its raid sometime today, as it comes under fire for its actions in the incident.

Although some reports indicated that more had died, it's now believed that nine people were killed in the Israeli attack on the convoy, although one witness had put the death toll as high as sixteen. The details of the raid still remain unclear and repatriated flotilla activists have challenged the Israeli version of the deadly raid.

The origins of the raid are still unclear; Israel says that their troops had opened fire in self-defense after being attacked when they boarded a ship. Other reports from witnesses said that there had been only wooden sticks on board the vessels under the control of activists, however, and an Israeli official said that troops had attacked while still overhead the ships in helicopters.

The attack has been widely condemned by the international community, especially Turkey, whose prime minister called the incident a "bloody massacre." A statement from Turkey's Parliament said that "[t]his attack was an open violation of United Nations rules and international law." Turkey has already recalled its ambassador to Israel, a move that came on Monday, and according to the Israeli media, families of Israeli diplomats are being evicted from Turkey.

Israel's defense minister, Ehud Barak, visited troops who had been involved in the incident, saying that "[w]e need to always remember that we aren't North America or Western Europe, we live in the Middle East, in a place where there is no mercy for the weak and there aren't second chances for those who don't defend themselves."

Meanwhile, hundreds of Gazans are using the newly opened Egyptian Rafah Border Crossing which is allowing in food and medical supplies as well as sick and injured Palestinians out who are seeking medical treatment.

<h3>&lt;a href="Manhunt%20in%20Cumbria%2C%20United%20Kingdom%2C%20after%20series%20of%20shootings"&gt;Manhunt in Cumbria, United Kingdom, after series of shootings&lt;/a&gt; (2:42)</h3>

As Israel attempts to deal with the international fallout from the violence off the coast of Gaza, police in the UK have confirmed that twelve people had been killed with a further twenty five injured, three critically for a series of shootings that occurred in Whitehaven, Seascale and Egremont at a total of thirty different crime scenes. 

After an intensive manhunt, police found the body of the prime suspect, 52 year old local man Derrick Bird, a taxi driver. The first of Bird's victims was a fellow taxi driver shot in Whitehaven at about 10.30 local time, with the following victims being shot at random as Bird drove down the west coast. Originally driving a Citroën Picasso, he was later said to be on foot when he crashed his vehicle.

Members of the public were advised police to stay indoors and for those who saw him not to approach but rather to inform police. During the incident, the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant was locked down for the first time in its history. The manhunt covered the Boot and Scafell Pike area and around 2:00pm local time, the Deputy Chief Constable of Cumbria reported that a body believed to be Bird was found in a wood near Boot with a firearm, apparently having turned the weapon on himself.

The affected area is popular with hikers, and currently, many schools across England are on half term, meaning pupils have no classes.

Home Secretary Theresa May is due to make a statement on the incident to the House of Commons tomorrow.

<h3>&lt;a href="US%20Supreme%20Court%20relaxes%20strict%20interpretation%20of%20self%20incrimination%20ruling"&gt;US Supreme Court relaxes strict interpretation of self incrimination ruling&lt;/a&gt; (4:55)</h3>

In a 5–4 decision on Tuesday, the US Supreme Court ruled that once a suspect of a criminal investigation is informed of his right to remain silent, he must specifically invoke that right if he does not want his words to be used against him. 

The case involved a fatal shooting in 2000 in Michigan committed by Van Chester Thompkins. Before questioning, he was informed of his rights, including the right to remain silent and the right to consult an attorney, but Thompkins did not tell the officer he wished to invoke those rights. During questioning, the suspect gave few, limited responses. 

After about two hours and forty-five minutes, however, the interrogator asked "Do you pray to God to forgive you for shooting that boy down?" Thompkins replied "yes". Even though he refused to sign a confession, that one-word statement was used against him in trial, and Thompkins was convicted of first-degree murder. 

The conviction was upheld by Michigan state courts and a federal district court, but was overturned by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Supreme Court disagreed and subsequently reinstated the conviction. 

In the case, designated Berghuis v. Thompkins, the high court's conservative majority observed that since he was already informed of his rights, the defendant waived those rights when he voluntarily made an incriminating statement during interrogation. The majority opinion was written by Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito. 

The court's decision continues a recent trend of siding with the police and restricting the rights of criminal suspects. In her dissenting opinion, Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote that the decision is a step back from protections against forced self incrimination as provided for in the landmark 1966 case Miranda v. Arizona. She was joined by the court's other three liberal associate justices: John Paul Stevens, Steven Breyer, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. 

While the US Supreme Court was handing down its decision, the Swiss Supreme Court was also hard at work, but the stakes were quite different.

<h3>&lt;a href="Poker%27s%20all%20about%20luck%2C%20says%20Swiss%20Supreme%20Court"&gt;Poker's all about luck, says Swiss Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; (6:57)</h3>

The Supreme Court in Lausanne, Switzerland ruled that Texas hold 'em poker is a game of luck, rather than a game of skill. As a result, only casinos can host poker tournaments in Switzerland. Private games with friends, even where money is at stake, are still permitted under the ruling.

Poker tournaments had been growing in popularity in the country, with many events held in hotels and bars. Such venues do not have to pay the 50% tax on profits levied on licensed casinos, nor comply with regulations combating money laundering and gambling addiction. Poker is now categorized alongside roulette and slot machines, which as games of luck can only be played inside casinos. Mathematics, strategy, and bluffing were less important in determining the result than chance, said the judges, overturning a lower court ruling to the opposite effect, and disagreeing with the stance of the country's Federal Gaming Commission.

Before the ruling, it had been estimated by the Swiss Federation of Casinos that there were about 100 unlicensed poker tournaments every weekend. A Swiss poker website, SwissPokerTour.ch, has described the result as "a black day for all amateur poker players in Switzerland."

Some poker players may have an even harder time anteing up as

Hewlett-Packard (HP) expects to lose 9,000 jobs between now and 2013 in a US$1 billion (£686m) restructuring plan.

The 9,000 jobs losses will be in the enterprise services division, but the company expects to add about 6,000 employees to its sales and delivery teams.

HP commented in a statement, "As a result of productivity gains and automation, HP expects to eliminate roughly 9,000 positions over a multi-year period to reinvest for further growth and to increase shareholder value"

HP will invest in fully automated data centers as it makes operational changes in its Internet technology services business. HP said the restructuring will generate savings of $500–700 million (about €407–571 million) in net savings after reinvestment.

Hewlett-Packard has around 300,000 employees and is the world's largest technology company by sales. HP is an American multinational information technology corporation headquartered in Palo Alto, California.

While many workers are being forced to find new opportunities, at least one has decided just to quit all together.

<h3>&lt;a href="Japanese%20Prime%20Minister%20Yukio%20Hatoyama%20to%20resign"&gt;Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama to resign&lt;/a&gt; (9:24)</h3>

Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama resigned today, following a controversial move regarding a US military base.

Hatoyama told a nationwide news broadcast that he will step down after a broken campaign promise to move a US Marine base off the southern island of Okinawa. The decision to resign followed poor poll ratings for Japan's Democratic Party in an upcoming parliamentary election. Members of the party have called for Hatoyama's resignation in order to preserve their chances of victory in the election. He is expected to formally resign before a meeting of party leaders today.

Hatoyama had previously won a landslide election last August, but his approval ratings of late were around 20%. He will likely be succeeded by current Japanese Finance Minister Naoto Kan. Hatoyama also mentioned a series of financial scandals that had plagued him in his decision to resign. Democratic Party secretary-general Ichiro Ozawa, who was involved in the scandals, also agreed to leave when asked by Hatoyama. He will be the fourth Japanese leader in a row to resign without being in office for a year.

Hatoyama had made a deal Friday with US president Barack Obama retain the Marine base on Okinawa, citing threats to both countries' national security, but the agreement was strongly opposed in Japan. His resignation means that the deal may not go through after all.

As Yukio Hatoyama joins the ranks of former politicians,

Former US Vice President Al Gore announced earlier today that he would separate from Tipper Gore, his wife of 40 years. The Gores called the decision "mutual."

In an e-mail to close friends, Al and Tipper Gore said that they would not make additional comments. The message was confirmed by a spokesperson for the Gore family. A family friend said, "There isn't anyone else. They just want to go their separate ways."

In the e-mail, Al and Tipper Gore said that "This is very much a mutual and mutually supportive decision that we have made together, following a process of long and careful consideration."

The announcement was met with surprise in Washington, D.C. Both were raised around the city, and met at a high school dance. 62-year-old Al Gore was the Vice President of the United States during the Clinton presidency and lost the 2000 US presidential election to George W. Bush. He also received the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts concerning climate change. 61-year-old Tipper Gore is a professional photographer and co-founded the Parents Music Resource Center. On May 19, the couple observed their 40th wedding anniversary. The Gores have four children.

<h3>&lt;a href="Jetstar%20to%20offer%20iPads%20as%20an%20in-flight%20entertainment%20option"&gt;Jetstar to offer iPads as an in-flight entertainment option&lt;/a&gt; (13:04)</h3>

Jetstar Airways, a Qantas owned Australian low-cost airline, has announced plans to trial Apple iPads as an in-flight entertainment option. This trial would make Jetstar one of the first airlines in the world to offer the iPad.

Starting later this month, Jetstar plans to begin a two-week trial, during which passengers will have the option to rent iPads for $10AU on domestic flights longer than an hour. Thirty iPads would be available on each test plane. These devices would be preloaded with games, e-books, music and video content. Internet access however will be disabled as per Jetstar's policy on internet connected devices, said spokeswoman Andrea Wait.

The iPads offered by Jetstar, will be specially customized by Bluebox Avionics. Bluebox Avionics, at present, is the only company to offer iPads as part of an in-flight entertainment system. Jetstar will be the first to offer the Bluebox Avionics iPad based systems, though, Bluebox Avionics has said the system will be available to other airlines soon.

Shortly following the initial release of the iPad, Jetstar chief information officer Stephen Tame speculated that the iPad "may lead in the future the end of airline in-flight entertainment systems". Depending on the results of the trial, iPads may replace existing Jetstar in-flight entertainment systems.

Jetstar chief executive Bruce Buchanan said he expected the iPads to be very popular during the trial. If the trial is successful, the airline would “be looking to roll out the devices across our entire domestic and international network later in the year"

Finally, in sports, Chile has announced its official list of players for South Africa Football World Cup. 

The team did however cut Roberto Cereceda, a player from Colo-Colo, from the list. Chilean press had pointed out that Cereceda was the most probable player to be discarded, although Marcelo Bielsa, coach of the football team, said some weeks ago that his inclusion in the list was not being discussed.

In 455, the second of three barbarian sacks of Rome, the sack of 455, came at the hands of the Vandals, then at war with the usurping Western Roman Emperor Petronius Maximus.

In 440s, the Vandal king Genseric and the Roman Emperor Valentinian III, had betrothed their children, Huneric and Eudocia, to strengthen their alliance, reached in 442 with a peace treaty. The marriage had to be delaye, however, as Eudocia was too young at the time.

In 455 Valentinian was killed, and Petronius Maximus rose to the throne. Petronius married Valentinian's widow, Licinia Eudoxia, and had his son Palladius marry Eudocia; in this way Petronius was hoping to strengthen his bond with the Theodosian dynasty, a Roman family that rose to eminence in the waning days of the Roman Empire.

This move, however, damaged Genseric's ambitions. The king of the Vandals claimed that the broken betrothal between Huneric and Eudocia was an invalidation of his peace treaty with Valentinian, and set sail to attack Rome.

Upon the Vandal arrival, according to the chronicler Prosper of Aquitaine, Pope Leo I requested that Genseric not destroy the ancient city or murder its inhabitants. Genseric agreed and the gates of Rome were thrown open to him and his men. Maximus, who fled rather than fight the Vandal warlord, was killed by a Roman mob outside the city, possibly together with his son Palladius.

There is, however, some debate over the severity of the Vandal sack. The sack of 455 is generally seen by historians as being more thorough than the Visigothic sack of 410, because the Vandals plundered Rome for fourteen days whereas the Visigoths spent only three days in the city.

The cause of most controversy, however, is the claim that the sack was relatively "clean", in that there was little murder and violence, and the Vandals did not burn the buildings of the city. This interpretation seems to stem from Prosper's claim that Leo managed to persuade Genseric to refrain from violence. However, Victor of Vita, an African bishop of the Province of Byzacena, records how many shiploads of captives arrived in Africa from Rome, with the purpose of being sold into slavery. Similarly, the Byzantine historian Procopius reports how at least one church was burnt down.

It would be nearly 100 years before Rome was once again sacked, this time in 546 by the Gothic king Totila, but Rome's influence and glory had faded and Europe began to splinter into various feudal states with only the Byzantine's in Constantinople left to carry on the tradition and wealth of knowledge of the empire.

After six seasons, &lt;a href="England"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; Premier &lt;a href="soccer"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href="Liverpool%20F.C."&gt;Liverpool F.C.&lt;/a&gt; and manager &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARafael%20Ben%C3%ADtez"&gt;Rafael Benítez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have parted ways. The separation was by mutual consent.

The 50-year-old Spaniard joined the club in June 2004, replacing Gerard Houllie. He had early success with the club, earning the &lt;a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League"&gt;Champions League&lt;/a&gt; title over &lt;a href="A.C.%20Milan"&gt;A.C. Milan&lt;/a&gt; in 2005 and the FA Cup title the next season, before returning to the Champions League final in 2007, this time losing to A.C. Milan.

Under Benítez, Liverpool has a less than stellar home success for the club with the most major trophies in English football, finishing second in the league just once, while finishing third and fourth twice each.

Liverpool Chairman &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20Broughton"&gt;Martin Broughton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; thanked Benítez for his service, saying that after a seventh-place finish in the Premier League this season, it was time to move on.

"Rafa will forever be part of Liverpool folklore after bringing home the Champions League following the epic final in Istanbul but after a disappointing season both parties felt a fresh start would be best for all concerned," Broughton said, in a statement released by the club today.

"It is very sad for me to announce that I will no longer be manager of Liverpool F.C," Benítez said, in a statement released by the club. "I would like to thank all of the staff and players for their efforts.

"I'll always keep in my heart the good times I've had here, the strong and loyal support of the fans in the tough times and the love from Liverpool. I have no words to thank you enough for all these years and I am very proud to say that I was your manager.

"Thank you so much once more and always remember: You'll never walk alone."

Today on Wikinews : Talks continue in Bonn, Germany for the upcoming climate change conference; Apple sells 2 million iPads, Claude Giroux scores the game winner in game 3 of the Stanley Cup finals and, in history, "Mighty Casey" fails to get the game winner for Mudville in 1888.

Today is Thursday, June 3rd, 2010. I'm Dan Harlow and this is Wikinews.
<h2>Script</h2>
<h3>&lt;a href="Second%20round%20of%20Bonn%20UN%20Climate%20Change%20negotiations%20continue"&gt;Second round of Bonn UN Climate Change negotiations continue&lt;/a&gt; (0:35)</h3>

The second of four preparatory rounds of negotiations leading up to this years United Nations Climate Change Conference continued in Bonn, Germany today. The 4,500 attendees include government delegates from 182 governments, representatives from business and industry, environmental organizations and research institutions. 

Among the discussions were a focus on emissions reduction commitments for the 37 industrialized countries that have ratified the Kyoto Protocol for the period beyond 2012. 

The talks were designed to discuss issues that were not resolved at the 2009 UN Climate Change Conference which were held in Copenhagen amid mass protests. Between 40,000 and 100,000 people attended the protests in Copenhagen last year and activists claimed that the police had used wire-taps, undercover officers and pepper spray on people who had been detained. In all, 968 protesters were arrested but only 13 were finally charged. Protests had also been held in London, England and Melbourne, Australia. 

This year, the United Nations Climate Change Conference will be held in Cancún, Mexico, from 29 November to 10 December

As the world attempts to clean up the environment, Apple is cleaning up in the marketplace as

<h3>&lt;a href="Apple%20sells%20two%20million%20iPads%20in%20two%20months"&gt;Apple sells two million iPads in two months&lt;/a&gt; (1:48)</h3>

the company announced on Monday that it has sold over two million iPads, just two months after the device began shipping in the US and only days after its international launch.

Apple shares rose 2.9 percent to US$264.29 Tuesday afternoon. Market analysts also upped price targets and sales estimates in response to the announcement. Shares for AT&amp;T, who provides data plans for the iPad, also rose yesterday.

Prior to the iPad's April 3 launch, many analysts had speculated about the viability and marketability of the device. However, iPad sales have been faster than anticipated. Although it was only expected to sell one million iPads for the whole quarter, Apple announced in early May that it had surpassed the one-million mark in just 28 days. It again surprised industry watchers, who were expecting about 1.6–1.7 million iPads to have been sold when Apple announced that it had passed the two-million mark. 

iPad sales may make up over ten percent of Apple's revenue this quarter, a feat that took the iPhone twice as long to achieve. The iPad has been so popular and supplies of the tablet so low that Apple tried to place limits on the number of iPads a person can purchase and postponing sales of the iPad to Europe and Asia until last weekend due to strong demand for the tablet in the US.

While some people are able to watch their favorite television shows on an iPad, many still rely on an old fashioned television, however, 

<h3>&lt;a href="British%20soap%20opera%20Coronation%20Street%20postponed%20after%20Cumbria%20shooting"&gt;British soap opera Coronation Street postponed after Cumbria shooting&lt;/a&gt; (3:15)</h3>

an episode of the British soap opera Coronation Street has been postponed after it was due to air on the same day as a string of shootings in Cumbria occurred killing 12 people and injuring several more. The episode, due to be broadcast on ITV last night, featured a siege and hostage situation heavily involving guns.

The soap was replaced with an episode of Harry Hill’s TV Burp, a comedy program which takes a satirical look at the week in television. ITV released a statement saying they postponed the episode "out of respect to those affected by today's tragedy."

Finally, in sports, 

<h3>(4:00)</h3>

Claude Giroux scored the overtime, game winning goal to lift the Philadelphia Flyers to victory over the Chicago Blackhawks in Game 3 of the 2010 Stanley Cup Finals. The shot came at 5:59 into the overtime period on a redirection off Matt Carle's pass, squeezing the through the right arm and leg of Blackhawks goalie Antti Niemi.

Flyers captain Mike Richards told CBC Sports that the game-winning goal was a big relief to the team. "We came out and played hard," Richards said. "Both teams played extremely well and we were lucky to get the last goal."

Like the first two games, this one was decided by a one-goal margin, but was not an offensive shootout like Game 1 or a defensive standoff as in game 2.

Chicago and Philadelphia will continue the best-of-seven series on Friday night at Philadelphia's Wachovia Center.

<h2>On this day in history (4:52)</h2>

To honor Detroit Tigers pitcher, Armando Galarraga, who pitched a perfect game yesterday only to have it taken away on a blown call in the ninth inning from umpire Jim Joyce: in 1888, the poem "Casey At The Bat" was published for the first time by Ernest Thayer, a humor columnist for the San Francisco Examiner.

The poem is about an American baseball team from the fictional town of Mudville (implied to be the home team) who are losing by two runs with two outs in their last inning. Both the team and its fans believe they can win "if only" they could somehow get "Mighty Casey" (Mudville's star player) up to bat. However, Casey was scheduled to be the fifth batter of the inning – the first two batters (Cooney and Barrows) did not reach base, while the next two batters (Flynn and Jimmy Blake) were perceived to be weak hitters with little chance of reaching base to allow Casey an at bat.

Surprisingly, Flynn hits a single, and Jimmy Blake follows with a double (Flynn reaching third on the play). Both runners were now in scoring position and Casey represented the potential winning run. However, Casey is so confident in his abilities that he doesn't swing at the first two pitches, both strikes. On the last pitch, the overconfident Casey strikes out, ending the game and sending the crowd home unhappy.

Here is DeWolf Hopper's famous recording of the poem which was released in October 1906.

In &lt;a href="basketball"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKobe%20Bryant"&gt;Kobe Bryant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; hit a three-pointer late in the fourth quarter to lift the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20Lakers"&gt;Los Angeles Lakers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to a 102–89 victory over the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABoston%20Celtics"&gt;Boston Celtics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in Game 1 of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2010%20NBA%20Finals"&gt;2010 NBA Finals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Thursday night in Los Angeles, California. Bryant scored 30 points in the game to lead all scorers.

Bryant was backed-up by a 23-point, 14-rebound effort from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APau%20Gosol"&gt;Pau Gosol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and 15 points from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARon%20Artest"&gt;Ron Artest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . For Boston, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Pierce"&gt;Paul Pierce&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; had 24 points and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Garnett"&gt;Kevin Garnett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; had 16 points.

"They were the more physical team by far," Celtics coach Doc Rivers said after the game, according to the Associated Press. "They were more aggressive. They attacked us the entire night. I didn't think we handled it very well."

While both teams have displayed consistent defensive showing, Boston could not match L.A.'s output.

"You can't ease into the game, especially in the finals," Pierce said, according to the Associated Press. "That's one of the better rebounding teams in the NBA. We've just got to do a better job rebounding the ball, eliminating easy opportunities. When I look up and we've given up 100 points, I haven't seen that in a while."

The first quarter was fairly evenly matched, ending 26–21 in favor of the Lakers. At one point the Lakers were up 16–10, but Boston was able to close to within one point. Late points by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJordan%20Farmar"&gt;Jordan Farmar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AShannon%20Brown"&gt;Shannon Brown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; built the lead to five in the final minute and the Lakers had the chance to go up by more, but &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALamar%20Odom"&gt;Lamar Odom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; missed a six-foot jump-shot.

In the second quarter, both team remained close until late in the quarter when the Lakers opened an 12-point lead late in the final minute. With just two tenths of a second on the clock, Boston's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARajon%20Rondo"&gt;Rajon Rondo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; hit a three-pointer to bring the score to within nine: 50–41.

At the half, Bryant told ABC Sports that the team done okay in the first half.

"We blew a couple of assignments," Bryant, who had 12 points in the half, said of the Celtics defense. "We felt like we could have stretched the game a bit more."

In the third quarter, the Lakers continued to pull away from the Celtics, outpacing them by 11 points. With 28 seconds left in the quarter, Artest hit a three-pointer to put Los Angeles up 84–64. Bryant had 14 points in the quarter.

In the fourth quarter, Los Angeles could not extend their lead and in the first four minutes Boston went on a 10-3 run to close the gap to 13 points. Both team scored two more points before Gosol slammed home what turned out to be the game-winning points with 6:20 left to put the Lakers up 91–76. In the final six minutes, Boston outscored the Lakers 13–11, but it was not enough to bring the game back to single digits.

Both Pierce and Ray Allen fouled-out for the Celtics. Odam fouled-out for Los Angeles.

This series is the 12th between the two franchises, dating back to 1959, with the Celtics leading the series 9–2. The Minneapolis Lakers first appeared in the Basketball Association of America &amp;mdash; the precursor to the NBA &amp;mdash; defeating the Washington Capitols 4–2. The next year, Minneapolis defeated Syracuse Nationals 4–2 in the first NBA. The Celtics first played in the NBA finals in 1957, defeating the St. Louis Hawks 4–3.

In 1959, the Lakers and Celtics first faced each other in the Finals. The Celtics won the series 4–0. In 1962, the Lakers &amp;mdash; now in Los Angeles &amp;mdash; met for the second time &amp;mdash; this time winning 4–3. It was not until the eighth meeting &amp;mdash; in 1985 &amp;mdash; did the Lakers win.

Before the start of the game, NBA Commisioner David Stern commented on the historic rivalry.

"When I first became commissioner in the '80s," Stern told the ♡❤Los Angeles Times♡❤, "I thought what you did every June is you went from L.A. to Boston and back again, and it was interesting to watch. And now here we are again."

The best-of-seven series resumes Sunday night at Los Angeles' &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStaples%20Center"&gt;Staples Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Today on Wikinews : Thousands mourn the death of the activists killed in the Gaza flotilla incident; The World Health Organization continues to rank the H1N1 virus at the highest possible threat rating; SpaceX successfully launches the commercial Falcon 9 rocket and, in history, 2 brothers invent a contraption to carry humans into the sky ... but it's not the brothers you think.

Today is Friday, June 4th, 2010. I'm Dan Harlow and this is Wikinews.
<h2>Script</h2>
<h3>&lt;a href="Turkey%20mourns%20flotilla%20dead"&gt;Turkey mourns flotilla dead&lt;/a&gt; (0:42)</h3>

Tens of thousands attended the funeral of the nine Turkish nationals, including one teen of dual U.S.-Turkish citizenship, on Thursday for those who died in Israel's Gaza flotilla raid while released activists arrived to their home countries yesterday and today.

There was widespread anger from those attending the funeral and Turkish President Abdullah Gül said that Turkey would act calmly, saying "Turkey will never forget such an attack on its ships and its people in international waters. The relations between Israel and Turkey will never be the same again, unless Israel apologizes."

Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu insisted that soldiers were acting in self-defense and said the activists were not peace activists but "violent supporters of terrorism". Israel has stated that of the 7 soldiers wounded during the assault, 2 were shot with weapons wrestled from Israeli forces. But Swedish activist Mattias Gardell scoffed at such statements, replying, "the Israelis started shooting first. We had no weapons, the Israelis had weapons".

The youngest of the nine activists killed, Furkan Dogan, a 19-year-old high school student, was shot in the head and chest. He was born in Troy, New York, but moved to Turkey when he was two. He will be buried in his family's hometown of Kayseri in central Turkey on Friday. A United States State Department spokesman said it would probe the death of the Turkish-American killed, but said the FBI were not involved "at this point."

The incident occurred when activists had attempted to break the Israeli blockade of Gaza. Another vessel, the Irish ship MV Rachel Corrie, is arriving some time this weekend and will be the next ship to challenge the blockade. 

As the flames of anger spread across the middle east over the Gaza flotilla incident, 

<h3>&lt;a href="Large%20fires%20kill%20many%20in%20Dhaka%2C%20Bangladesh"&gt;Large fires kill many in Dhaka, Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt; (2:33)</h3>

At least 114 people have been killed by fires in the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka.

According to local fire official Nazrul Islam, the fire started in an apartment complex when an electrical transformer exploded. The fire that started at about 8:45pm local time on Thursday then spread to six or seven other buildings in the densely populated Najiranazar neighborhood of old Dhaka.

Witnesses said that fueling the flames were chemicals from illegal home-based factories in the Kayettuli neighborhood which is one of the most densely populated neighborhoods in Dhaka.

The fire was brought under control after three hours of effort on Friday morning, leaving at least 114 dead and a further 40 injured of which 10 to 12 are in critical condition. The current casualties follows the death of 25 in a previous fire on Tuesday.

People living in densely populated areas not only have to contend with the spread of fire, but also the increased threat of infectious disease and 

<h3>(3:34)</h3>

The World Health Organization says that the H1N1 influenza virus, although not as intense as it has been in the past, still poses a threat and the pandemic is not yet over.

Gregory Hartl, a spokesman for the organization, told the Reuters news service that "We're still in the pandemic,"

Margaret Chan, the organization's director, commented that the pandemic alert level will remain at six, the highest possible rating. She noted that the WHO may look at the situation again in July and see if a revision is necessary then.

An emergency committee consisting of fifteen advisers stated that countries should remain on the lookout for the pandemic, and encouraged measures to be implemented for disease surveillance and control. The panel was held on Tuesday, but Chan didn't announce the comments until yesterday.

<h3>&lt;a href="Irish%201901%20census%20goes%20online"&gt;Irish 1901 census goes online&lt;/a&gt; (5:28)</h3>

The earliest surviving complete census of Ireland has been put freely online.

It contains more than 4.5 million records from 850,000 households across the 32 counties on the night of Sunday March 31 1901. The Census of Ireland, 1911 records, went online in 2009 and have attracted more than 260 million hits.

The 1901 census lists James Joyce, the famous poet and writer, as a 19-year-old student living with his family in Fairview, Dublin as well as a 22-year-old Pádraig Pearse, one of the leaders of the Easter Rising in 1916.

Most of the census records from the 19th century have been lost due to various reasons including a fire at the Public Records Office during the Irish Civil War in 1922. Digitisation of the records has cost almost €4 million and the work has been carried out by the National Archives of Ireland in partnership with Library and Archives Canada.

In the near future, the names of the first commercial astronauts may also become just as well known as Joyce and Pearse because

<h3>&lt;a href="SpaceX%20launches%20first%20Falcon%209%20rocket"&gt;SpaceX launches first Falcon 9 rocket&lt;/a&gt; (6:34)</h3>

Space Exploration Technologies, also known as SpaceX, successfully launched their Falcon 9 rocket for the first time at 2:45 pm local time from the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, Florida in the United States.

The Falcon 9, second in the Falcon series of rockets, has a first stage that is powered by nine Merlin 1C engines, and a second stage powered by one Merlin vacuum engine. Today's inaugural launch carried the Dragon Spacecraft Qualification Unit (DSQU), a boilerplate version Dragon capsule. The Dragon is intended to take cargo — and possibly people — to the International Space Station through NASA's Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program. 

The program is intended to help develop commercial space transportation, a goal that fits with President Obama's recent change of direction for NASA. Under President Obama's new plan, NASA would hand over the mundane task of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) launches to private companies, and instead concentrate on new technology development.

However, no private firms yet have the capability to independently launch humans into space, without NASA assistance. SpaceX CEO and founder Elon Musk hopes that the Falcon 9 will eventually fill the void in human rated commercial rockets, but he also recognizes the inherent risk and danger of rocket launches. "There's nothing more fear and anxiety-inducing than a rocket launch," said Musk.

Not everyone agrees with President Obama and Elon Musk. Republican Senator Richard Shelby doesn't think private firms are ready for the challenge of taking humans into space, preferring that government funding be directed to NASA instead. "Today the commercial providers that NASA has contracted with cannot even carry the trash back from the space station, much less carry humans to or from space safely," the Senator said.

Although today's launch succeeded, Musk had said earlier neither the success nor failure of the Falcon 9 would be the ultimate arbitrator of the fate of NASA's new commercial-friendly direction. "They sort of focus everything on us and try to create a situation where our first launch of Falcon 9 is somehow a verdict on the president's policy, which is not right," he said.

<h2>On this day in history (9:03)</h2>

With the success of the commercial SpaceX rocket, let's look back on this day in history when an astute businessman and his head-in-the-clouds brother take the first tentative steps towards the dream of human flight.

</ul>
We first need to begin in the year 1777 where in southeastern France, in Avignon, Joseph-Michel Montgolfier, the son of a paper manufacturer was contemplating a particularly vexing military problem of the day. 65 years previously, Spain had ceded Gibraltar to the Britain under the Treaty of Utrecht thus ending the War of the Spanish Succession. Spain was keen to retake the peninsula but an assault on the fortress of Gibraltar had been impossible as the garrison had proved impregnable by both sea and land. 

Why Joseph was contemplating this matter is unknown, but as the 12th child in the family, he possessed a typical inventor's temperament. Joseph was a maverick and dreamer, and was impractical in terms of business and personal affairs, quite unlike his younger brother, Jacques-Étienne who had a much more even and businesslike temperament and had been chosen to run the family business after the death of their father in 1772.

</ul>
So, while his younger brother, who is commonly referred to as simple Étienne, was toiling away incorporating the latest Dutch innovations of the day into the family paper mills, Joseph sat before a fire one evening watching laundry dry over a fire and observed how the cloth billowed upwards with the embers from the fire. Joseph then began to muse on the possibility of an air assault at Gibraltar using troops lifted by the same force that was billowing the cloth over the fire. He believed that contained within the smoke was a special gas, which he called 'Montgolfier Gas', with a special property he called levity.

</ul>
As a result of these musings, Joseph set about building a box-like chamber 1 meter cubed out of very thin wood and covering the sides and top with lightweight taffeta cloth, a crisp, smooth woven fabric made from silk. He then crumpled and lit some paper under the bottom of the box and the contraption quickly lifted off its stand and collided with the ceiling. 

Amazed, he recruited his brother Étienne saying "Get in a supply of taffeta and of cordage, quickly, and you will see one of the most astonishing sights in the world". One can only imagine what crazy scheme Étienne must have assumed his brother was getting into, but he agreed and the two brothers set about building a contraption 3 times larger in scale, however, the lifting force was so great that they lost control of their craft on its very first test flight on 14 December 1782 as the device floated nearly 2 kilometers and was then destroyed after landing by the "indiscretion" of passersby.

Even with the accident, the brothers saw this as a major success and they decided to make a public demonstration of a balloon in order to establish their claim to its invention. They constructed a globe-shaped balloon made of sackcloth with three thin layers of paper inside. The envelope could contain nearly 28,000 cubic feet of air, weighed 500 lbs and was constructed of four pieces (a dome and three lateral bands), and was all held together with 1,800 buttons. A reinforcing "fish net" of cord covered the outside of the envelope.

</ul>
On 4 June 1783, they flew the craft as their first public demonstration at Annonay, France in front of a group of dignitaries who were amazed as the flight covered 2 km, lasted 10 minutes, and had an estimated altitude of 5,200 - 6,600 ft. Word of the success quickly reached Paris and Etienne, the epitome of sober virtues; always modest in clothes and manner, went to the capital to make further demonstrations and to solidify the brothers' claim to the invention of flight. Joseph, given his unkempt appearance and shyness (he never married), remained with the family. 

Étienne was already well connected as he had already been awarded by the government of France a grant to establish the Montgolfier factory as a model for other French papermakers due to his penchant for technical innovation. This, combined with the widespread acclaim of the demonstration, allowed him to collaborate with a successful wallpaper manufacturer and they constructed a 37,500-cubic-foot envelope of taffeta coated with a varnish of alum, which has fireproofing properties. The balloon was sky blue and decorated with golden flourishes, signs of the zodiac and suns. 

However, there was some concern about the effects of flight into the upper atmosphere on living creatures. King Louis XVI himself suggested to launch two criminals to test the effects, but it is most likely that the inventors decided to send a sheep, duck, and rooster aloft first. The sheep was believed to have a reasonable approximation of human physiology. The duck was expected to be unharmed by being lifted aloft and was included as a control for effects created by the aircraft rather than the altitude. The rooster was included as a further control as it was a bird that did not fly at high altitudes. 

The demonstration was performed before a crowd at the royal palace in Versailles, before King Louis XVI of France and Queen Marie Antoinette. The flight lasted approximately eight minutes, covered two miles and obtained an altitude of about 1,500 feet and landed safely after flying.

On October 15th, 1783, Étienne became the first human to lift off the earth, making at least one tethered flight from the yard of their workshop.

</ul>
These early flights made a sensation and numerous engravings commemorated the events. In December of 1783 in recognition of their achievement, their father Pierre was elevated to the nobility and the hereditary appellation of de Montgolfier by King Louis XVI.

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; has nominated retired &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Air%20Force"&gt;Air Force&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Lieutenant General &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Clapper"&gt;James Clapper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to be the new &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Adirector%20of%20National%20Intelligence"&gt;director of National Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The position had been left vacant when the previous director of national intelligence was forced to leave due to a series of security failures. James Clapper now awaits confirmation by the &lt;a href="US%20Senate"&gt;US Senate&lt;/a&gt;.

Barack Obama has requested a quick confirmation from the Senate. Both &lt;a href="US%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;US Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republican Party&lt;/a&gt; senior representatives in the Senate Intelligence Committee have publicly expressed their reservation about the nomination. According to to the ♡❤Associated Press♡❤, Republican senator Kit Bond doubted Clapper's ability to command among some of the intelligence community personalities. "I don't think Clapper's the right person for the job," he said. The ♡❤Associated Press♡❤, informed by senior congressional staff, reported that the Republican senator had not been invited to discuss the nomination and is considering asking his Republican support to block the nomination.

Previous director of national intelligence &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADennis%20Blair"&gt;Dennis C. Blair&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; quit two weeks ago in the sequence of a series of security failures, including the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFort%20Hood%20shooting"&gt;Fort Hood shooting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; incident.

An acrobatic group known by the name of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASpelbound"&gt;Spelbound&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has been declared as the winner of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABritain%27s%20Got%20Talent%20%28series%204%29"&gt;Britain's Got Talent 2010&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a televised variety talent show competition broadcast on &lt;a href="ITV"&gt;ITV&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. As the winning act of the show, Spelbound have won &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APound%20sterling"&gt;£&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 100,000 (&lt;a href="United%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;144,580, &lt;a href="Euro"&gt;€&lt;/a&gt;120,313, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20dollar"&gt;A$&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 175,079) and a place at The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Variety%20Performance"&gt;Royal Variety Performance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , an annual gala evening that is attended by senior members of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Royal%20Family"&gt;British Royal Family&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

In no particular order, the top three acts were revealed to be two dancers known by their stage name of Twist and Pulse, gymnastic group Spelbound and Kieran Gaffney, whose act involves playing on the drum kit. After Kieran Gaffney was revealed to be in third place, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAnthony%20McPartlin"&gt;Anthony McPartlin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who hosts &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABritain%27s%20Got%20Talent"&gt;Britain's Got Talent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADeclan%20Donnelly"&gt;Declan Donnelly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , said to Kieran: "Well done Kieran. Kieran, you're a star, you came back, you got all the way to the final. I know you've loved this. You've loved this, haven't you?" In response to this, Kieran Gaffney stated: "Thank you very much. Thank you, everyone for supporting me. Thank you."

Shortly afterwards, on the episode that was broadcast live on ITV1 on Saturday, Anthony announced: "After tens of thousands of auditons, five semi-finals and an amazing final, this...this is it. One of you is about to walk away with £100,000 and a place at this year's Royal Variety Performance. The winner of Britain's Got Talent 2010 is...Spelbound!" Glen Murphy from Twist and Pulse commented about finishing in second place, stating: "Yeah, it's amazing. I can't even believe it. I can't believe it at all."

Alex Uttley, a 24-year-old member of Spelbound, commented on the gymnastic group's victory, commenting: "Oh, my god. This is unbelieveable. We just want to say thank you to everyone out there. It just shows that all our hard work has paid off." One of the coaches of Spelbound, named Neil Griffiths, stated about Spelbound: "Oh, they've worked so hard over the last few weeks. Um, since the semi-final, we...we really had to pull out the stops to try and up the game. They've not known they've worked in the gym from six in the morning till twelve...twelve o'clock of the night. I couldn't have asked for more. Um, it's a team of coaches. I don't take all the credit myself. There's, uh, two people up there that know who they are who've been fantastic."

Spelbound consists of 24-year-old Alex Uttley, Nicholas Illingworth, aged 24, Adam Buckingham, aged 21, 20-year-old Adam McAssey, 19-year-old Douglas Fordyce, 18-year-old Edward Upcott, 18-year-old Leighanne Cowler, 17-year-old Katie Axten, 17-year-old Lauren Kemp, 15-year-old Jonathan Stranks, Abigail Ralph, aged 15, 13-year-old Hollianne Wood and Amy Mackenzie, aged 12. Bookmakers had previously predicted that Spelbound would be the most likely act to become the winner of the series.

The running order for the final started with Twist and Pulse. The second act to perform was Liam McNally, a 14-year-old singer. The running order subsequently continued with 40-year-old impressionist Paul Burling, singer Christopher Stone, aged 28, Tina &amp; Chandi, a woman and dog dancing act, Connected, a five-piece singing group, Kieran Gaffney, aged 12, 22-year-old Tobias Mead, a dancer, 80-year-old singer Janey Cutler and Spelbound in that particular order.

Earlier on in the final, Britain's Got Talent judge &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAmanda%20Holden"&gt;Amanda Holden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has stated to Spelbound: "We are hosting the 2012 Olympics and I think 'what a brilliant opening act'." Fellow judge &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APiers%20Morgan"&gt;Piers Morgan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; also commented that "[t]he purpose of this show is to identify hidden great British talent. You are that act." After Spelbound won in the final, another judge, named Simon Cowell, stated that "the right boys and girls won on the night" and that he could "only say on live TV that that was one of the most astonishing things I have ever seen. Seriously."

According to &lt;a href="BP"&gt;BP&lt;/a&gt;'s chief executive &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Hayward"&gt;Tony Hayward&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; the equivalent to 10,000 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABarrel%20%28volume%29"&gt;barrels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of oil is being captured each day in the &lt;a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico"&gt;Gulf of Mexico&lt;/a&gt; by a containment cap. Around 12,000 to 19,000 barrels are leaking each day, implying that more than half of the oil being released is captured by the containment cap.

Tony Hayward expressed his company's intention of restoring the Gulf to its original state, after what has been described by many as one of the worst environmental disasters in the history of the &lt;a href="US"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;. "As we speak, the containment cap is producing around 10,000 barrels of oil a day to the surface." Hayward said. When asked about what amount of the leak the oil being captured represented, he claimed it was "the majority, probably the vast majority". 

Hayward feels confident that almost all of the leaking oil will be captured in the following week. "We have a further containment system to implement in the course of this coming week which will be in place by next weekend so when those two are in place, we would very much hope to be containing the vast majority of the oil." he said.

According to CNN, the US federal government's response manager, Adm. Thad Allen, said it was too early to call the operation a success, while admitting that BP had made progress in the handling of the situation. "We're making the right progress. I don't think anyone should be pleased as long as there's oil in the water," he said.

<h1>US White House correspondent Helen Thomas retires</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=US%20White%20House%20correspondent%20Helen%20Thomas%20retires&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Veteran White House journalist &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHelen%20Thomas"&gt;Helen Thomas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , 89, announced her retirement yesterday with immediate effect, ending her fifty-seven year career, amid criticism over controversial remarks.

Thomas has been a correspondent for over fifty years and has covered every president from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20F.%20Kennedy"&gt;John F. Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABarack%20Obama"&gt;Obama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Thomas, the daughter of &lt;a href="Lebanon"&gt;Lebanese&lt;/a&gt; immigrants, who blazed a trail for female reporters in politics in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, has ended her career after apologizing for saying that Israel should "get the hell out of Palestine."

In retiring, Thomas stated: "I deeply regret my comments I made last week regarding the &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israelis&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="Palestine"&gt;Palestinians&lt;/a&gt;. They do not reflect my heart-felt belief that peace will come to the &lt;a href="Middle%20East"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt; only when all parties recognize the need for mutual respect and tolerance. May that day come soon."

Her departure as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHearst%20Corporation"&gt;Hearst Newspaper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; columnist was announced after she was captured on video saying: "Remember, these people are occupied and it's their land. It's not Germany, it's not Poland," and that Israelis should "get the hell out of Palestine" and "they should go home" to Poland, Germany, the US and "everywhere else."

Rabbi David Nesenoff, an independent filmmaker, said he spoke to Thomas outside the White House on Jewish Heritage Day on May 27. Video of her controversial comments were widely disseminated on the Internet by his website, rabbilive.com, that relaunched last week.

Thomas was absent from Monday's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20White%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; briefing. She was dropped by her public speaking agency and a high school commencement address was canceled. The White House Correspondents Association called her remarks "indefensible". The Hearst statement came shortly after White House press secretary &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Gibbs"&gt;Robert Gibbs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; called her remarks "offensive and reprehensible."

Thomas has been a correspondent for fifty-seven years, she had worked for decades as a White House correspondent for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Press%20International"&gt;United Press International&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and became a columnist for the Hearst newspaper chain in recent years. She was the first female officer of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Press%20Club%20%28USA%29"&gt;National Press Club&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the first female member and president of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House%20Correspondents%20Association"&gt;White House Correspondents Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and, in 1975, the first female member of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGridiron%20Club"&gt;Gridiron Club&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Thomas did little to hide her views, with her questions to Presidents &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; and their press secretaries often about the wars in the &lt;a href="Middle%20East"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt;. Two weeks ago, she asked Obama, "Mr. President, when are you going to get out of Afghanistan? Why are you continuing to kill and die there? What is the real excuse?

<h1>Nurseries not harmful to children, says new UK study</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Nurseries%20not%20harmful%20to%20children%2C%20says%20new%20UK%20study&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
A new study by a professor at the &lt;a href="University%20of%20Oxford"&gt;University of Oxford&lt;/a&gt; has concluded that attending &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Anursery%20school"&gt;nursery school&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; does not have harmful effects upon "the vast majority" of children under two years old. The research contrasts with the views of other writers in the field, who argue that pre-school children achieve the best results when cared for by their parents full-time.

Kathy Sylva, Professor of Educational Psychology at the university, has based her findings upon data from the Effective Provision of Pre-School Education Project. This has been running since 1996, tracking the development of 3,000 children to discover the effects upon their development of pre-school care and education. 

Sylva told ♡❤The Sunday Times♡❤ that "[a] lot of parents worry unnecessarily about this issue but my research shows that the vast majority of children are not impaired on any measure by attending nursery under the age of two", although she admits that there is an increased risk for children from deprived background, and for boys. Those attending better-quality nurseries go on to make better relationships when they start school, she says, and urges parents to check the standards of nurseries for themselves.

Her conclusions come in the wake of a vast expansion in nursery care provision in the United Kingdom in recent years, aimed at getting mothers of young children back to work. One study states that 5% of "middle-class" parents in Britain put their children in full-time nursery care.

According to others such as the child psychologist &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOliver%20James"&gt;Oliver James&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , however, full-time care by parents gives the best results for children. James states that there is evidence that nursery care is "highly stressful and can be harmful", since levels of the hormone &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acortisol"&gt;cortisol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; double after one hour in day care, and raised levels can be detected for some months afterwards. Sylva agrees, though, that some children who attend nursery before they are two are slightly more aggressive at primary school – a finding in line with other research – but says that this aggression disappears by the time the child reaches eleven.

Sylva, a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOxbridge%20Fellow"&gt;Professorial Fellow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJesus%20College%2C%20Oxford"&gt;Jesus College, Oxford&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , was awarded the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOrder%20of%20the%20British%20Empire"&gt;OBE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 2008. She is a former special advisor to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom"&gt;UK House of Commons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AScottish%20Parliament"&gt;Scottish Parliament&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

<h3>&lt;a href="Ban%20on%20YouTube%20spreads%20to%20Google%20services%20in%20Turkey"&gt;Ban on YouTube spreads to Google services in Turkey&lt;/a&gt; (0:40)</h3>

Access to search engine Google has been limited and most of Google's online services cannot be accessed in Turkey. The access limitation happened due to the blocking of an IP set that belongs to Google. These IP addresses were shared between YouTube and other Google services.

Softpedia states that the limited access to Google could be a result of the government trying to block specific DNS addresses that relate to Google, as part of its ongoing attempts to block YouTube following after insults against Turkish Republic founder Mustafa Kemal Atatürk were posted on the site. Since Google services share common software and IP addresses, the search engine itself suffers from access restrictions. Turkish citizens are concerned that this move of the governmental agency was another step towards a complete ban on Google, as exists in China. Under Turkish law, it is an offense to "insult Turkishness." 

Several Internet sites have been banned in Turkey in recent years, and although some of them were subsequently unbanned, most of them remain inaccessible. Engelli Web, a website listing banned sites reports that currently YouTube (since May 2008), Last.fm (since June 26, 2009), and Spanish newspaper El Mundo (since May 14, 2010) are among the banned sites in Turkey. MySpace and WordPress were also among banned sites for a period of time. RetweetToday reports that Turkish citizens on Twitter have also reported access problems.

With the ban on Google, citizens of Turkey will not be able to access Google Earth to notice that 

<h3>&lt;a href="Slovenia%20votes%20in%20favour%20of%20Croatian%20border%20deal"&gt;Slovenia votes in favour of Croatian border deal&lt;/a&gt; (2:19)</h3>

Slovenians yesterday voted in a referendum in favor of a border deal with Croatia. The Border Arbitration Agreement allows for international arbitrators to resolve a 20 year border dispute that dates back to the break-up of Yugoslavia.

Parliaments in both countries approved the deal, which will be binding on both countries. In March, Slovenian Prime Minister Borut Pahor's center-left government yielded to demands for a referendum on whether to accept a border deal. "Solving the border dispute with Croatia is the basis for a lasting peace, security and friendship of both nations," Pahor said. 

The national Electoral Commission said that after 99.9 per cent of votes were counted, 51.5 per cent voted for the deal and 48.5 were against it. It is impossible for the remaining 2,000 votes, cast by Slovenians living abroad, to change the outcome.

Slovenia is situated between Italy and Croatia, where the dispute involves land on the Istrian peninsula in the northern Adriatic and the small Bay of Piran in the Adriatic Sea. A panel of five international experts will define the new land and maritime borders and could force Croatia to cede some of the sea it views as its own. In the past, Croatia has called for the border to be drawn down the middle of the bay. However, Slovenia, which has a much shorter coastline, feared that this would deny its ships direct passage to international waters.

Slovenia is the only former Yugoslav state to have joined the European Union (EU), while Croatia hopes to conclude EU accession talks this year and join the twenty-seven member union in 2012. A rejection could have delayed Croatian membership and Slovenia has blocked Croatia's membership talks over the border issue in the past. Croatian President Ivo Josipovic welcomed the outcome as "a victory for Slovenia, Croatia and Europe."

José Manuel Barroso, President of the European Commission said, "This is an important step forward. We now look forward to a final settlement of the dispute. Resolving this bilateral issue is an important signal for the region and the relations between Slovenia and Croatia."

While rivers have traditionally been used as natural and disputed borders between nations, they also pose a risk to local residents.

Last weekend, an eight-year-old boy died after falling into the River Wharfe, known for its depth and strong undercurrent in North Yorkshire, England. The accident took place on Aaron Page's birthday, following celebrations with over twenty family members.

Page made his way to the river near Skipton around 3pm local time on Saturday; his brother, aged thirteen, was the first to call for assistance after spotting Aaron in the water. Emergency services subsequently assisted in searching for Aaron whose body was recovered at approximately 6:25 pm the same day. Members of the ambulance service failed to resuscitate him, pronouncing him dead at the scene.

Inspector Kevin Franks of North Yorkshire Police stated "Despite efforts from members of the public and some quite sterling efforts from the emergency services and everyone else there, sadly we've been unable to bring him out alive."

Mike Woodhall, an inspector for Harrogate police cautioned; "[n]o matter how safe a river seems sometimes there are inherent dangers."

<h3>&lt;a href="San%20Francisco%20hit-and-run%20suspect%20caught%20after%20lying"&gt;San Francisco hit-and-run suspect caught after lying&lt;/a&gt; (6:57)</h3>

A suspect in a hit-and-run located in San Francisco, California, was arrested after hitting four cyclists and, two days later, lying to the police. Over the course of six minutes, the 39-year-old man hit four people with his car and then ran off when his car crashed into another vehicle and hit a pole. 

The suspect later told the police at Albany Police Station that his car was stolen, and after the police identified that as a lie, he was arrested. The police believes that the victims were deliberately targeted, although the motive remains a mystery and the suspect is currently in hospital for medical and psychological testing. 

The attack left bicycles crumpled and some cars damaged, one severely, according to San Francisco police spokeswoman, Lyn Tomkioka. "We're just really glad that he's been arrested," she said. Mayor Gavin Newsom and the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition condemned the attack, stating that there are currently efforts to make San Francisco "one of the most bike-friendly cities in the country". Three of the victims were hospitalized, two in serious condition and one in fair condition.

In a nation famous for bicycles and public transportation, 

<h3>&lt;a href="Hong%20Kong%27s%20only%20railway%20company%20modifies%20regulations"&gt;Hong Kong's only railway company modifies regulations&lt;/a&gt; (8:07)</h3>

The MTR Corporation, the only railway company in Hong Kong since the rail merge in 2007, has loosened their rules to allow 'non-disruptive' use of profanity in private conversations, and the punishment for inflammatory use of expletives has been lowered from a fine of HK$5000 to HK$2000. The new set of rules have also excluded the regulation against wandering in MTR premises, as well as the rule against attempting to eat or drink.

Democratic Party member James To has expressed his concerns about a new rule that outlaws the display of promotional material. According to To, the wearing of Tiananmen Square Incident-related T-shirts may breach the new MTR rules. He also deems two other regulations, namely the prohibition of distracting MTR staff members and photography and video-recording in the train carriages, 'unreasonable'.

Wong Kwok-hing, a member of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong, believes that the MTR corporation should call upon more effort to advertise a more 'civilized' and 'polite' way of taking the train. Fellow Legco member Jeffrey Lam thinks that the new rules do not do enough to restrict shouting. MTR replied that anyone who shouts in the train can be advised to leave the train or even prosecuted.

The new rules will go into effect in September.

As Hong Kong's trains busily shuttle citizens en route to their destinations, 

<h3>&lt;a href="Men%20isolated%20to%20mimic%20Mars%20flight"&gt;Men isolated to mimic Mars flight&lt;/a&gt; (9:38)</h3>

following a similar experiment in 2009, six men entered an enclosed room in Moscow last Thursday to simulate a flight to Mars. The Mars-500 team consist of a Chinese man, a Frenchman, an Italian, and three Russians. Only the Chinese man, Wang Yue, is a trained astronaut. The six waved goodbye, crying "see you in 520 days' time!".

According to Wang, not being able to see their families and friends was one of the greatest challenges, although e-mail is allowed during the experiment. Both Wang and the Frenchman, Romain Charles, expressed pride to be part of this experiment. Wang said, "it will be trying for all of us. We cannot see our family, we cannot see our friends, but I think it is all a glorious time in our lives."

The joint-effort project is being organized by the Russian Institute for Biomedical Problems (IBMP) and the European Space Agency; the goal is to study physical and psychological effects on would-be astronauts. All six men speak reasonable English; however, as Russian is another primary language for the simulated trip, Russian crew member Sukhrob Kamolov said body language will be used should they fail to understand one another.

Food for the volunteers will be rationed as it would in a real Mars mission. All supplies were supplied by China and loaded into the 'simulated spacecraft' prior to the beginning of the experiment. For backup, China is sending three mission support staff to Russia.

No women are included in the crew, excluding issues relating to a mixed-sex crew from the study. During a similar experiment in 1999, a woman complained that the captain attempted to kiss her.

Following 250 days of "traveling" to Mars, the group will split. Three will stay in the "spacecraft", the other three going to the surface of "Mars". Only two will actually leave the "spacecraft" to study the surface of "Mars". After a month, the group will go through the return journey simulation, a 240 day trip. The men will follow a strict timetable, with 8 hours each of sleep, work, and leisure every day.

In 1837, Alois Hitler, father of Adolph Hitler is born in the small rustic village of Strones in northwest Lower Austria just north of Vienna, to a 42-year-old unmarried peasant, Maria Anna Schicklgruber.

After he was baptized at the nearby village of Döllersheim, the space for his father's name on the baptismal certificate was left blank and the priest wrote "illegitimate".

When he was 13, he left the farm in Spital and went to Vienna as an apprentice cobbler, working there for about five years. In response to a recruitment drive by the Austrian government offering employment in the civil service to people from rural areas, Alois joined the frontier guards (customs service) of the Ingland Finance Ministry in 1855 at the age of 18. Alois Hitler made steady progress in the semi-military profession of a customs official. The work involved frequent re-assignments and he served in a variety of places across Austria and by 1875, he became an inspector of customs posted at Braunau.

As a rising young junior customs official, Alois used his birth name of Schicklgruber, but in the summer of 1876, 39 years old and well established in his career, he asked permission to use his stepfather's family name. He appeared before the parish priest in Döllersheim and asserted that his father was Johann Georg Hiedler, who had married his mother and now wished to legitimize him. He apparently did not disclose to the priest that Johann had been dead for almost 20 years. With three relatives appearing as his wittiness, the priest agreed to amend the records, the civil authorities automatically processed the church's decision, and Alois had a new name. The official change, registered at the government office in Mistelbach in 1876 transformed "Alois Schicklgruber" into "Alois Hitler."

Alois openly admitted having been born out of wedlock before and after the name change. He had done well by local standards and was not hampered by his name. The limiting factor was education. Alois eventually rose to full inspector of customs and could go no higher because he lacked the necessary school degrees.

Alois was 36 when he married for the first time, and it may have been for money. Anna Glassl was a wealthy, 50-year-old daughter of a customs official. She was sick when Alois married her and was either an invalid or became one shortly afterwords. Not long after marrying Anna, however, Alois began an affair with 19-year-old Franziska "Fanni" Matzelsberger, one of the young female servants employed at the Pommer Inn, house #219, in the city of Braunau am Inn, where he was renting the top floor as a lodging. 

Alois had numerous affairs in the 1870s, resulting in his sick wife Anna initiating legal action and on 7 November 1880 Alois and Anna separated by mutual agreement. Franziska became the 43-year-old Hitler's girlfriend, but the two could not marry since under Roman Catholic canon law, divorce is not permitted.

Then, in 1876, he hired Klara Pölzl, the 16-year-old granddaughter of Hitler's step-uncle, as a household servant and was soon pregnant by Hitler. Hitler could have married Pölzl immediately but because of the affidavit concerning his paternity, Hitler was now legally Pölzl's first cousin once removed, too close to marry. He submitted an appeal to the church for a humanitarian waiver, not mentioning Pölzl was already pregnant, which was granted on 7 January 1885 and a wedding was held early in the morning at Hitler's rented rooms on the top floor of the Pommer Inn. A meal was served for the few guests and witnesses. Hitler then went to work for the rest of the day. Even Klara found the wedding to be a short ceremony. Throughout the marriage, she continued to call him uncle.

On 17 May 1885, five months after the wedding, the new Frau Klara Hitler gave birth to her first child, Gustav. A year later, on 25 September 1886, she gave birth to a daughter, Ida. Son Otto followed Ida in 1887, but he died shortly after birth. Later that year, diphtheria tragically struck the Hitler household, resulting in the deaths of both Gustav and Ida. Klara had been Hitler's wife for three years, and all her children were dead.

On April 20, 1889, she gave birth to another son, future Nazi dictator Adolf. He was a sickly child, and his mother fretted over him. Hitler had little interest in child rearing and left it all to his wife. When not at work he was either in a tavern or busy with his hobby, keeping bees. In 1892, Hitler was transferred from Braunau to Passau. He was 55, Klara 32, and Adolf was three years old.

Alois wanted his son to follow him and seek a career in the civil service. However, Adolf had become so alienated from his father that he was repulsed by whatever Alois wanted. It has been said he behaved like a self-important tyrant at home. Historiean Robert G. L. Waite noted, "Even one of his closest friends admitted that Alois was 'awfully rough' with his wife [Klara] and 'hardly ever spoke a word to her at home.'" So, where his father glorified the role of the civil servant, Adolf sneered at the thought of a lifetime spent enforcing petty rules. Alois tried to browbeat his son into obedience while Adolf did his best to be the opposite of whatever his father wanted.

On the morning of January 3, 1903, Hitler went to the Gasthaus Wiesinger as usual to drink his morning glass of wine. He was offered the newspaper and promptly collapsed. He was taken to an adjoining room and a doctor was summoned but Alois Hitler died at the inn, probably from a pleural hemorrhage. He was 65 when he died.

Some Schicklgrubers (Alois Hitler's birth name) remain in Waldviertel. One of this extended clan, "Aloisia V" aged 49, died in 1940, in an Austrian Nazi gas chamber.

__NOEDITSECTION__

The &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACommunication%20Workers%27%20Union%20%28UK%29"&gt;Communication Workers' Union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have effectively rejected a belated revised pay offer by telecoms giant &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Telecom"&gt;British Telecom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Their statement, released early this evening, indicates a formal ballot on strike action is inevitable &amp;ndash; unless the company revises their two percent offer for 2010.

The deadline set by the Communication Workers' Union (CWU) passed at noon last Friday, apparently unheeded by BT. The union's announcement of their intent to ballot members apparently resulted in the offer &amp;mdash; one with no new money on the table for this year.

Last week, when their ultimatum was ignored, CWU deputy secretary general (DSG) Andy Kerr expressed deep disappointment, citing the substantial profits made by the company in the last financial year: "[w]e're obviously very disappointed that BT has not improved its pay offer of 2% despite their healthy profits this year."

The turnaround from losses of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APound%20sterling"&gt;£&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 244 million to a billion-pound-plus profit has, the union claims, galvanised their membership into seriously considering industrial action. Reports of senior directors receiving million-pound bonuses, and former &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALabour%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Labour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; minister &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APatricia%20Hewitt"&gt;Patricia Hewitt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; landing over over £50,000 extra per-year, are characterised as "directors' 'snouts in the trough'". Hewitt was suspended from her parliamentary party in March over cash-for-access accusations, and works two to three days each month on BT's remuneration committee.

The UK's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APress%20Association"&gt;Press Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; described the now-rejected offer as being worth 2% this year, and an additional 3% in 2011 with staff bonuses of up to £250. The package supposedly contains pledges on no compulsory redundancies and the return of call centre and non-frontline work from outsource companies in &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;.
♡❤Wikinews♡❤ called both the Communication Workers' Union, and British Telecom, seeking clarification on a number of points. Richard Knowles, a BT press officer in &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, forwarded their terse sub-400-word statement, refusing to be drawn on reports that the offer includes the repatriation of call centre and back-office jobs. When challenged on this work being carried out in a jurisdiction with less-stringent &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AData%20Protection%20Act%201998"&gt;data protection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AComputer%20Misuse%20Act%201990"&gt;computer misuse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; legislation, our reporter was referred back to the company's statement.

Sian Jones of the CWU's Press Office, commenting prior to the union's evening statement, remarked that repatriation of call centre work was an issue that the union had prior, unrelated, discussions with BT about; she gave no indication to ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ this was, or was not, part of BT's revised offer.

The press release, shortly after 1630 BST, expressed clear intent to carry on with the process of balloting members on strike action. In the statement, CWU DGS Andy Kerr states, "[w]e're very disappointed that BT's revised offer remains materially unchanged for this year in terms of pay."

Continuing, he emphasised, "[...] we've made clear, 2 per cent is unacceptable for our members as it does not reflect the reward they expect given the contribution they have made to cost savings of £1.75 billion and profits of over £1bn. In addition, inflation is at 5.3 per cent and staff are comparing this offer with the large salary rises and bonuses for senior executives which expose the blatant double standards being adopted by the company when it comes to remuneration."

The CWU statement also expresses concern over BT's disclosure of details within the offer; "BT's decision to leak their offer to the media today has also raised trust issues for us with the company."

Any sustained action by CWU members in BT's employ could have a major impact on the country's communication infrastructure. Millions of UK households and businesses are reliant on BT for internet access &amp;ndash; in addition to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Atelephony"&gt;telephony&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; services.

Following the release of their statement, the CWU's Sian Jones confirmed that the union had not, as-yet, given BT the formal seven-days notice of balloting members on strike action.

Any ballot would run for a two-week period; following such, the union would, again, be required to give seven days notice to BT; this time of their intent to take workers out on strike. She emphasised, "nobody wants to be on strike", stressing that the union last took such action in 1987, and would prefer round-table discussions and an improved offer.

The structure of BT's privatisation, and breakup to permit level playing-field telephony and broadband competition, would see other &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20service%20provider"&gt;Internet service providers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; who rely on the ageing, once &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeneral%20Post%20Office"&gt;GPO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -owned, copper &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APlain%20old%20telephone%20service"&gt;POTS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; infrastructure unable to resolve customer faults. According to the CWU, BT has been querying managerial staff on their skillsets &amp;ndash; as a form of preparation for any industrial action. A union spokesperson described this as "laughable".

When called for comment on the union's rejection of their revised offer, the BT press office declined to comment at this time.

Two nine-month-old babies were hospitalised after appearing to be mauled by a fox as they slept in cots in their home in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHackney"&gt;Hackney&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , West &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. The attack happened on Saturday at 22:00 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABST"&gt;BST&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (21:00 UTC). It is thought the fox entered through an open door on the ground floor of the house, which was located beside &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVictoria%20Park%2C%20London"&gt;Victoria Park&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; .

The babies both suffered bite wounds on their arms, while one was also bitten on the face. Both are said to be in "serious but stable" conditions.

The babies' mother, Pauline Koupparis, spoke of her shock to hear and see the foxes in her house to local &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; radio station London 94.9: "It's something I would never have expected to happen &amp;mdash; let alone to us and my beautiful girls. It was quite muffled but very pained. I went into the room and I saw some blood in Isabella's cot, I thought she had a nosebleed. I put on the light, I saw the fox, it just looked at me and it wasn't even scared of me. I started screaming as I realised Lola was also covered in blood."

Hackney environmental health officers set traps in the rear garden of the property the night after the attack, and a fox was caught; this was humanely killed shortly after midnight. It is not yet known if this fox was responsible for the attack.

It is thought there are some 35,000 urban foxes living in the UK, and some experts believe that as much as a third of that number live in the capital. However, attacks on humans are very rare, generally occurring if the fox is trapped and is threatened.

The United States military has arrested an intelligence analyst who may have been responsible for leaking classified combat video and documents to the whistle-blower website &lt;a href="Wikileaks"&gt;Wikileaks&lt;/a&gt;.
The man arrested has been identified by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWired%20magazine"&gt;♡❤Wired♡❤ magazine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as an &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEnlisted%20rank"&gt;enlisted&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; soldier, &lt;a href="Bradley%20Manning"&gt;Bradley Manning&lt;/a&gt; of the United States Army's 2nd Brigade, 10th Mountain Division. Manning, a 22-year-old &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASpecialist%20%28rank%29"&gt;specialist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from Potomac, Maryland, is said to have been detained for two weeks on base in Kuwait awaiting trial. The United States military confirmed an arrest and said it "takes the management of classified information very seriously."

The footage was acquired from an undisclosed source in 2009 by Wikileaks. Wikileaks says the "&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJuly%2012%2C%202007%20Baghdad%20airstrike"&gt;Collateral murder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; " footage shows the "murder of Iraqi civilians and two Reuters journalists."

♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ had unsuccessfully requested the footage under the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFreedom%20of%20Information%20Act"&gt;Freedom of Information Act&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 2007, as two of its news staff, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASaeed%20Chmagh"&gt;Saeed Chmagh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANamir%20Noor-Eldeen"&gt;Namir Noor-Eldeen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , had died in the attack.

In addition to the video of the Baghdad attack, Manning is suspected of having leaked other classified information, including footage of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGranai%20airstrike"&gt;Granai attack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and a classified Army document evaluating Wikileaks as a security threat, which the site posted in March. Wikileaks is preparing to release a video of the Granai attack in Afghanistan, which killed around 100 civilians.

A summary of the Pentagon investigation into the Granai airstrike, including a video, was due to be released in 2009.

Initial composition of jury members in a &lt;a href="human%20trafficking"&gt;human trafficking&lt;/a&gt; criminal trial began Tuesday in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AClearwater%2C%20Florida"&gt;Clearwater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWTVT-TV"&gt;WTVT-TV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ reported this may be the first such case in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATampa%20Bay%20Area"&gt;Tampa Bay Area&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

An individual named Colin Anthony Dyer was placed under arrest in May 2009. Dyer, 37, faces charges in the case including human trafficking and sexual battery. Accusations against Dyer include human trafficking on one woman, and both sexual battery and human trafficking on another young woman. 

Law enforcement officials stated Dyer along with three other individuals restrained women without their permission in a residence in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATreasure%20Island%2C%20Florida"&gt;Treasure Island&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Florida. According to statements by those investigating the case, Dyer and his associates made these women work as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AProstitution"&gt;prostitutes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . 

Other individuals that were arrested related to the case included Kenyatta Cornelius, Edward Jones, and Corinna Shaffer. The case involving Dyer is the first of these people to be heard in court at trial. 

Law enforcement officials have said that Dyer raped a woman and made her work in the capacity of a prostitute at a strip club called "Vegas Showgirls", located near &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Petersburg%2C%20Florida"&gt;St. Petersburg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Florida.

Prior to admitting possible jury members into the courtroom, Pinellas-Pasco Circuit Judge Timothy Peters asked lawyers if a plea bargain deal had been made between the parties. Bryant Camareno, lawyer for Dyer, stated his client did not wish to plead guilty. Lawyers for the government did not give Dyer a formal plea bargain deal offer. Judge Peters queried Dyer regarding his understanding that he could be sentenced to a maximum of 60 years in jail, and Dyer answered in the affirmative.

Police detectives have stated that this might be the first case in Florida dealing with the human trafficking of citizens of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.

Today on Wikinews : BP claims to be capturing 10,000 barrels of oil a day in the Gulf of Mexico; White House journalist Helen Thomas retires after controversial remarks about Israel are aired online; China publicly criticizes North Korea for killing three Chinese nationals; 2 small children are attacked by foxes while they slept and, in history, the first man to measure the true dimensions of the solar system is born in 1625.

Today is Tuesday, June 8th, 2010. I'm Dan Harlow and this is Wikinews.
<h2>Script</h2>
<h3>&lt;a href="Containment%20capsule%20captures%2010%2C000%20oil%20barrels%20a%20day%20in%20Gulf%20of%20Mexico"&gt;Containment capsule captures 10,000 oil barrels a day in Gulf of Mexico&lt;/a&gt; (0:45)</h3>

According to BP's chief executive Tony Hayward the equivalent to 10,000 barrels of oil is being captured each day in the Gulf of Mexico by a containment cap. Around 12,000 to 19,000 barrels are leaking each day, implying that more than half of the oil being released is being captured by the cap.

Tony Hayward expressed his company's intention of restoring the Gulf to its original state, after what has been described by many as one of the worst environmental disasters in the history of the US. "As we speak, the containment cap is producing around 10,000 barrels of oil a day to the surface." Hayward said. When asked about what amount of the leak the oil being captured represented, he claimed it was "the majority, probably the vast majority".

Hayward feels confident that almost all of the leaking oil will be captured in the following week. "We have a further containment system to implement in the course of this coming week which will be in place by next weekend so when those two are in place, we would very much hope to be containing the vast majority of the oil." he said.

According to CNN, the US federal government's response manager, Adm. Thad Allen, said it was too early to call the operation a success, while admitting that BP had made progresses in the handling of the situation. He added that "I don't think anyone should be pleased as long as there's oil in the water,".

BP isn't the only British entity having public relations troubles.

<h3>&lt;a href="Strike%20ballot%20to%20go%20ahead%20despite%20British%20Telecom%27s%20belated%20new%20pay%20offer"&gt;Strike ballot to go ahead despite British Telecom's belated new pay offer&lt;/a&gt; (2:11)</h3>

The UK's Communication Workers' Union have effectively rejected a belated revised pay offer by telecoms giant British Telecom. Their statement, released early this evening, indicates a formal ballot on strike action is inevitable – unless the company revises their two percent offer for 2010.

The deadline set by the Communication Workers' Union (CWU) had passed at noon last Friday but apparently went unheeded by BT. The unions' announcement of their intent to ballot members apparently resulted in the offer.

Last week, when their ultimatum was ignored, CWU deputy secretary general Andy Kerr expressed deep disappointment, citing the substantial profits made by the company in the last financial year: "[w]e're obviously very disappointed that BT has not improved its pay offer of 2 per cent despite their healthy profits this year."

The turnaround from losses of £244 million to a billion-pound-plus profit has, the union claims, galvanised their membership into seriously considering industrial action. Senior BT directors have been reported to have received million-pound bonuses including former Labour minister Patricia Hewitt who landed over £50,000 extra per-year. Hewitt was suspended from her parliamentary party in March over cash-for-access accusations, and works two to three days each month on BT's remuneration committee.

The UK's Press Association described the now-rejected offer as being worth 2% this year, and an additional 3% in 2011 with staff bonuses of up to £250. The package supposedly contains pledges including the return of call center and non-frontline work from outsource companies in India.

Wikinews called both the Communication Workers' Union, and British Telecom, seeking clarification on a number of points. Richard Knowles, a BT press officer in London, forwarded a company statement, but did not comment if the offer includes the repatriation of call center and back-office jobs. When asked on this work being carried out in a jurisdiction with less-stringent data protection, and computer misuse legislation, the reporter was referred back to the company's statement.

Sian Jones of the CWU's Press Office, commenting prior to the union's evening statement, remarked that repatriation of call center work was an issue that the union had prior, unrelated, discussions with BT regarding; she gave no indication to Wikinews this was, or was not, part of BT's revised offer.

The press release expressed clear intent to carry on with the process of balloting members on strike action. In the statement, Andy Kerr states, "[w]e're very disappointed that BT's revised offer remains materially unchanged for this year in terms of pay."

Continuing, he emphasized, "[...] we've made clear, 2 per cent is unacceptable for our members as it does not reflect the reward they expect given the contribution they have made to cost savings of £1.75 billion and profits of over £1bn. In addition, inflation is at 5.3 per cent and staff are comparing this offer with the large salary rises and bonuses for senior executives which expose the blatant double standards being adopted by the company when it comes to remuneration."

Any sustained action by CWU members in BT's employ could have a major impact on the country's communication infrastructure. Millions of UK households and businesses are reliant on BT for internet access – in addition to telephony services.

Following the release of their statement, the CWU's Sian Jones confirmed that the union had not, as-yet, given BT the formal seven-days notice of balloting members on strike action.

Any ballot would run for a two-week period; following such, the union would, again, be required to give seven days notice to BT; this time of their intent to take workers out on strike. She emphasized, "nobody wants to be on strike", stressing that the union last took such action in 1987, and would prefer round-table discussions and an improved offer.

When called for comment on the union's rejection of their revised offer, the BT press office declined to comment at this time.

<h3>&lt;a href="US%20White%20House%20correspondent%20Helen%20Thomas%20retires"&gt;US White House correspondent Helen Thomas retires&lt;/a&gt; (6:28)</h3>

Veteran White House journalist Helen Thomas, 89, announced her retirement yesterday with immediate effect, ending her fifty-seven year career, amid criticism over controversial remarks.

Thomas has been a correspondent for over fifty years and has covered every president from John F. Kennedy to Obama. Thomas, the daughter of Lebanese immigrants, who blazed a trail for female reporters in politics in the United States, has ended her career after she was captured on video saying: "Remember, these people are occupied and it's their land. It's not Germany, it's not Poland," and that Israelis should "get the hell out of Palestine" and "they should go home" to Poland, Germany, the US and "everywhere else."

In retiring, Thomas stated: "I deeply regret my comments I made last week regarding the Israelis and the Palestinians. They do not reflect my heart-felt belief that peace will come to the Middle East only when all parties recognize the need for mutual respect and tolerance. May that day come soon."

Rabbi David Nesenoff, an independent filmmaker, said he spoke to Thomas outside the White House on Jewish Heritage Day on May 27 and video of her controversial comments were widely disseminated on the Internet by his website, rabbilive.com, that relaunched last week.

Thomas was absent from Monday's White House briefing. She was dropped by her public speaking agency and a high school commencement address was canceled. The White House Correspondents Association called her remarks "indefensible". White House press secretary Robert Gibbs called her remarks "offensive and reprehensible."

Thomas has been a correspondent for fifty-seven years, she had worked for decades as a White House correspondent for United Press International and became a columnist for the Hearst newspaper chain in recent years. She was the first female officer of the National Press Club, the first female member and president of the White House Correspondents Association, and, in 1975, the first female member of the Gridiron Club.

Thomas did little to hide her views, with her questions to Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama and their press secretaries about the wars in the Middle East. Two weeks ago, she asked Obama, "Mr. President, when are you going to get out of Afghanistan? Why are you continuing to kill and die there? What is the real excuse?"

Helen Thomas has written five books. During Kennedy's administration, Helen ended all presidential press conferences with a signature "Thank you, Mr. President" and always issued a caveat about her work: "In my career you're only as good as your last story."

<h3>&lt;a href="China%20says%20North%20Korea%20border%20patrol%20killed%20three%20Chinese"&gt;China says North Korea border patrol killed three Chinese&lt;/a&gt; (9:44)</h3>

The government of China has made a rare public protest over allegations that the North Korean border patrol shot three Chinese nationals dead and injured a fourth near the Chinese town of Dandong last week. Qin Gang, a spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry reported that the government of China has formally complained to North Korea, despite the two countries' normally amicable relationship.

Qin says that the men were shot "on suspicion of crossing the border for trade activities", and that "China attaches great importance to that and has immediately raised a solemn representation with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea". He reports that the incident is currently under investigation, but refuses to comment on the validity of the accusations. "In the aftermath of the incident, China has paid a lot of attention to this issue and has made a formal diplomatic protest to North Korea," said Qin.

China is North Korea's primary source of international trade, and illegal traders crossing the border are perceived as a great threat. North Korea is also involved in a dispute with its neighbor, South Korea, regarding the sinking of a South Korean ship in March, killing 46 people; while an international committee found that North Korea was responsible, China refuses to place any blame on the nation, which it sees as an ally. Heung Gwang, a former North Korean college professor and head of Seoul-based North Korea Intellectuals Solidarity, said that because of this "it is rare for China to publicly complain. Usually there is a private apology or money paid."

Dandong is the site of the Sino-Korea Friendship Bridge, a commemoration of China's aid of North Korea during the Korean War of the 1950s. The Chinese people were reported to be in a boat when they were shot, for allegedly carrying copper wire out of North Korea and into China.

The North Korean border guards caused controversy last year, when they detained two United States journalists on the Chinese border on charges of illegally entering the country. They were sentenced to twelve years hard labor, but a campaign led by former US president Bill Clinton saw their release after only four months.

<h3>&lt;a href="Eight%20injured%20after%20train%20derails%20in%20Argyll%2C%20Scotland"&gt;Eight injured after train derails in Argyll, Scotland&lt;/a&gt; (11:53)</h3>

An investigation is currently under way in Argyll, Scotland, following a derailment on the Glasgow – Oban railway. The incident took place at 9:00pm local time on Sunday, close to the 'Falls of Curchan' station. According to reports, both carriages of the derailed unit had also caught fire. At the location of the incident, the railway line is on an embankment above a local roadway, and the lead car came to rest, overhanging this road.

All passengers have been successfully evacuated, with eight being taken to hospital with "serious but not life-threatening" injuries and there were no fatalities. A spokesperson for the ambulance service stated soon after the incident: "There's quite a lot of walking wounded. There's a couple of bumps to necks and backs and things like that."

Inspector David McEwan was quoted as confirming that the lead coach was "sitting in a precarious position overhanging the roadway", and continued "the coach could slip further down the embankment on to the roadway [...] This is obviously a major concern for the engineers at this moment in time."

Railway engineers are currently working to stabilize the site, and re-open the line. According to a Scotrail spokesperson "an investigation is already under way into the cause of the incident by appropriate agencies and industry partners". The line between Glasgow and Oban remains closed, with buses service replacing trains.

Another scary incident took place in the UK when

<h3>&lt;a href="Urban%20fox%20%27mauls%27%20two%20babies%20in%20London%2C%20England"&gt;Urban fox 'mauls' two babies in London, England&lt;/a&gt; (13:17)</h3>

two nine-month-old babies were hospitalized after appearing to be mauled by a fox as they slept in cots in their home in Hackney, West London. The attack happened on Saturday at 10:00 pm local time and tt is thought the fox entered through an open door on the ground floor of the house, which was located beside Victoria Park.

The babies both suffered bite wounds on their arms, while one was also bitten on the face. Both are said to be in "serious but stable" conditions.

The babies' mother, Pauline Koupparis, spoke of her shock to hear and see the foxes in her house to local BBC radio station London 94.9: "I went into the room and I saw some blood in Isabella's cot, I thought she had a nosebleed. I put on the light, I saw the fox, it just looked at me and it wasn't even scared of me. I started screaming as I realised Lola was also covered in blood."

Hackney environmental health officers set traps in the rear garden of the property the night after the attack, catching one which was then humanely killed shortly after midnight. It is not yet known if this fox was responsible for the attack.

It is thought there are some 35,000 urban foxes living in the UK, and some experts believe that as much as a third of that number live in the capital. However, attacks on humans are very rare, generally occurring if the fox is trapped and is threatened.

As wildlife may pose a risk to children living in close proximity to wild animals, 

<h3>&lt;a href="Nurseries%20not%20harmful%20to%20children%2C%20says%20new%20UK%20study"&gt;Nurseries not harmful to children, says new UK study&lt;/a&gt; (14:41)</h3>

A new study by a professor at the University of Oxford has concluded that attending nursery school does not have harmful effects upon "the vast majority" of children under two years old. The research contrasts with the views of other writers in the field, who argue that pre-school children achieve the best results when cared for by their parents full-time.

Kathy Sylva, Professor of Educational Psychology at the university, has based her findings upon data from the Effective Provision of Pre-School Education Project. This has been running since 1996, tracking the development of 3,000 children to discover the effects upon their development of pre-school care and education.

Sylva told The Sunday Times that "[a] lot of parents worry unnecessarily about this issue but my research shows that the vast majority of children are not impaired on any measure by attending nursery under the age of two", although she admits that there is an increased risk for children from deprived background, and for boys. Those attending better-quality nurseries go on to make better relationships when they start school, she says, and urges parents to check the standards of nurseries for themselves.

Her conclusions come in the wake of a vast expansion in nursery care provision in the United Kingdom in recent years, aimed at getting mothers of young children back to work. One study states that 5% of "middle-class" parents in Britain put their children in full-time nursery care.

According to others such as the child psychologist Oliver James, however, full-time care by parents gives the best results for children. James states that there is evidence that nursery care is "highly stressful and can be harmful", since levels of the hormone cortisol double after one hour in day care, and raised levels can be detected for some months afterwords. Sylva agrees, though, that some children who attend nursery before they are two are slightly more aggressive at primary school – a finding in line with other research – but says that this aggression disappears by the time the child reaches eleven.

<h3>&lt;a href="Portugal%20holds%20first%20same-sex%20marriage"&gt;Portugal holds first same-sex marriage&lt;/a&gt; (17:17)</h3>

The lesbian couple, Teresa Pires and Helena Paixao, married in a Lisbon, Portugal registry office on Monday. As they kissed and hugged Pires said, "This is a great victory, a dream come true," and that they would continue to fight for equal rights for homosexuals, including adoption.

The couple had campaigned for a change in the law since 2006, when they were turned away from a registry office. Officials stipulated that marriage was between people of different sexes. They appealed to Portugal's Constitutional Court, saying that the constitution forbids discrimination based on sexual orientation, but the Court rejected their appeal.

Afterwords the government of José Sócrates introduced a bill removing the reference to marriage being between different sexes. The bill was passed by parliament in January and ratified by conservative President Anibal Cavaco Silva in May.

The government said the law is part of its effort to modernize Portugal, where homosexuality was a crime until 1982. Portugal is a predominantly Catholic country and is the sixth country in Europe to allow same-sex couples marriages, after Belgium, Spain, Norway, the Netherlands and Sweden.

<h3>&lt;a href="Human%20trafficking%20trial%20starts%20in%20Clearwater%2C%20Florida"&gt;Human trafficking trial starts in Clearwater, Florida&lt;/a&gt; (18:29)</h3>

Initial composition of jury members in a human trafficking criminal trial began Tuesday in Clearwater, Florida. WTVT-TV reported this may be the first such case in the Tampa Bay Area.

An individual named Colin Anthony Dyer was placed under arrest in May 2009. Dyer, 37, faces charges in the case including human trafficking and sexual battery. Accusations against Dyer include human trafficking on one woman, and both sexual battery and human trafficking on another young woman.

Law enforcement officials stated Dyer along with three other individuals restrained women without their permission in a residence in Treasure Island, Florida. According to statements by those investigating the case, Dyer and his associates made these women work as prostitutes.

Law enforcement officials have said that Dyer raped a woman and made her work in the capacity of a prostitute at a strip club called "Vegas Showgirls", located near St. Petersburg, Florida.

Other individuals that were arrested related to the case included Kenyatta Cornelius, Edward Jones, and Corinna Shaffer. The case involving Dyer is the first of these people to be heard in court at trial.

<h3>&lt;a href="Apple%20unveils%20iPhone%204%2C%20iOS%204%20at%20Worldwide%20Developers%20Conference%202010"&gt;Apple unveils iPhone 4, iOS 4 at Worldwide Developers Conference 2010&lt;/a&gt; (20:43)</h3>

Yesterday, at this year's Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), company CEO Steve Jobs unveiled iPhone 4, along with the new iOS 4 operating system for Apple mobile devices.

The announcement was long-awaited but not a very big surprise. In April, the technology blog Gizmodo obtained a prototype of the new phone and published details of it online. While introducing iPhone 4, at the annual conference, Jobs started by hinting at the incident, saying, "Stop me if you've already seen this."

The new iPhone was praised by Jobs as "the biggest leap we've taken since the original iPhone." It is only 9.3 millimeters (0.37 inches) thick, making it "the thinnest smartphone on the planet", a 24 percent reduction from Apple's previous model, the iPhone 3GS. Structure-wise, iPhone 4 has a new stainless steel frame, which acts as an antenna, supposedly boosting its signal reception abilities and possibly reducing the amount of dropped calls. It also has a new screen, dubbed a "retina display," which displays images at 326 pixels per inch and a new internal gyroscope as well. Even though it now uses Apple's faster A4 processor (first used in its iPad tablet), iPhone 4 has a claimed seven hours of 3G talk time, up two hours from the 3GS.

In addition to its design features, Jobs showed off iPhone 4's new video calling abilities. This feature is called FaceTime, and connects with other iPhone 4s via Wi-Fi. The phone has two cameras: one on the front for video chats, and one on the back for taking pictures and other videos. The rear camera has a resolution of five megapixels, is capable of recording high-definition video, and has an LED flash.

The iPhone 4 will use Apple's latest mobile operating system, iOS 4. Formerly "iPhone OS," iOS 4 was first introduced by Apple in April, and includes multitasking capabilities. Jobs called the new software "the most advanced mobile operating system in the world." iOS will support Apple's new mobile advertising service, iAd, which goes live on July 1.

iPhone 4 will be available on June 24 in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Japan. It comes in two colors—black and white—and two storage capacities. The 16GB version is priced at US$199 and the 32GB version at US$299. The iPhone 3GS's price will be reduced to US$99, and the iPhone 3G will be discontinued. iOS will be available as a free software update to users of compatible older Apple devices (including the 3GS) on June 21. In the U.S., iPhone 4 will only be available on AT&amp;T's cellular network, despite calls for Apple to let the iPhone be used on other carriers, such as Verizon.

Competition-wise, the BlackBerry mobile device is still the most popular smartphone right now. Apple is also facing some serious competition from web giant Google's Android operating system, as well as Palm's webOS. Earlier this year, Android phones managed to outsell iPhones. iPhone users, however, account for over half of those surfing the Internet on a mobile browser in the U.S. Jobs also noted that over five billion iOS applications, commonly called "apps," have been purchased from Apple's App Store. The App Store currently has around 225,000 different apps for sale.

Finally, in sports, 

<h3>&lt;a href="UCLA%20basketball%20coach%20John%20Wooden%20dies%20at%20age%2099"&gt;UCLA basketball coach John Wooden dies at age 99&lt;/a&gt; (24:15)</h3>

basketball coach John Wooden died at the age of 99 on Friday of natural causes.

Born in 1910 Wooden was the first person to be inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame as both a player (1961) and a coach (1973). After serving in the United States Navy as a lieutenant for three years in World War II, Wooden first coached at Indiana State University's Teacher's College from 1946 to 1948

In 1948 Wooden became the coach at UCLA. There he immediately turned a failing team into the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC) Southern Division Champions. His 27 seasons with UCLA culminated in 10 NCAA titles in his last 12 seasons, including a record seven in a row from 1967 to 1973.

Spurning a lucrative offer to coach the Los Angeles Lakers to remain at UCLA, Wooden stepped down in 1975 following a final NCAA championship winning season. Following his retirement Wooden embarked in a second career as an motivational speaer and author, becoming known for his "Pyramid of success", a philosophy in which synergistic behaviors reinforce each other to create success in life and basketball.

Wooden leaves behind a son James Hugh Wooden, and daughter, Nancy Anne Muehlhausen. His wife Nellie (Nell) Riley pre-deceased him in 1985 after 53 years of marriage.

</ul>
Giovanni Domenico Cassini was born in 1625 in Perinaldo, near Sanremo, at that time in the Republic of Genova. 

Cassini was the first to observe four of Saturn's moons, including Iapetus, whose anomalous variations in brightness he correctly ascribed as being due to the presence of dark material on one hemisphere. In addition he discovered the Cassini Division in the rings of Saturn in 1675 and he shares with Robert Hooke credit for the discovery of the Great Red Spot on Jupiter around 1665. 

Attracted to the heavens in his youth, his first interest was in astrology. While young he read widely on the subject of astrology, and soon was very knowledgeable about it; this extensive knowledge of astrology led to his first appointment as an astronomer. Later in life he focused almost exclusively on astronomy and all but denounced astrology as he became increasingly involved in the Scientific Revolution.

In 1672 he sent his colleague Jean Richer to Cayenne, French Guiana, while he himself stayed in Paris. The two made simultaneous observations of Mars and, by computing the parallax (the perceived change in location of an object seen from two different places), determined its distance, thus measuring for the first time the true dimensions of the solar system.

However, it was not until around 1705 when Edmond Halley realized that repeated sightings of a comet were actually recording the same object, returning regularly once every 75–76 years, that the term "Solar System" first appeared in English.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChelsea%20F.C."&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a &lt;a href="association%20football"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club based in &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, have confirmed that &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Cole"&gt;Joe Cole&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and will be leaving on &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Afree%20transfer"&gt;free transfers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; during the summer transfer window.

Chelsea, the current &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APremier%20League"&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; champions, reportedly stated they did not wish to offer Cole, an &lt;a href="England"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; international currently with the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEngland%20national%20football%20team"&gt;country's national team&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2010%20World%20Cup"&gt;2010 World Cup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;, another contract for next season. They declined to offer &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; captain 33-year-old Ballack a new deal; the player had been missing out on the World Cup with injury.

Cole has been at the club since joining from fellow London side &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Ham%20United%20F.C."&gt;West Ham United&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 2003, while Ballack's previous club was &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFC%20Bayern%20Munich"&gt;Bayern Munich&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of Germany, arriving under &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9%20Mourinho"&gt;José Mourinho&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Ballack was claimed to be "extremely surprised" by the news, having been on holiday in &lt;a href="Miami"&gt;Miami&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; at the time of being informed, according to agent Michael Becker. Ballack had previously rejected a reduced-wage, one-year contract, and was once the highest-earner at Chelsea, with a weekly wage of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APound%20sterling"&gt;£&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 121,000 (&lt;a href="US%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;175,123).

Several sources believe that many top finishers in the Premier League, including runners-up &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AManchester%20United%20F.C."&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , are keen to speak to 28-year-old Cole, as he has been free to initiate negotiations since January. However, no deal has yet been confirmed to have started.

<h3>&lt;a href="US%20intelligence%20analyst%20arrested%20over%20Wikileaks%20video"&gt;US intelligence analyst arrested over Wikileaks video&lt;/a&gt; (0:48)</h3>
The United States military has arrested an intelligence analyst who may have been responsible for leaking classified combat video and documents to the whistle-blower website Wikileaks.

The man arrested has been identified by Wired magazine as 22-year-old specialist, Bradley Manning of the United States Army's 2nd Brigade, 10th Mountain Division. Manning, from Potomac, Maryland, is said to have been detained for two weeks on base in Kuwait awaiting trial. The United States military confirmed an arrest and said it "takes the management of classified information very seriously."

The footage was acquired from an undisclosed source in 2009 by Wikileaks. Wikileaks says the "Collateral murder" footage shows the "murder of Iraqi civilians and two Reuters journalists."

</ul>
Reuters had unsuccessfully requested the footage under the Freedom of Information Act in 2007, as two of its news staff, Saeed Chmagh and Namir Noor-Eldeen, had died in the attack.

In addition to the video of the Baghdad attack, Manning is suspected of having leaked other classified information, including footage of the Granai attack and a classified Army document evaluating Wikileaks as a security threat, which the site posted in March. Wikileaks is preparing to release a video of the Granai attack in Afghanistan, which killed around 100 civilians.

A summary of the Pentagon investigation into the Granai airstrike, including a video, was due to be released in 2009.

While covering the wars in the Middle East is hazardous duty to all members of the media, a 2010 World Cup assignment in South Africa should be almost like a vacation, however, 

<h3>&lt;a href="Three%20football%20World%20Cup%20journalists%20robbed%20at%20gunpoint%20in%20South%20Africa"&gt;Three football World Cup journalists robbed at gunpoint in South Africa&lt;/a&gt; (3:04)</h3>

three foreign journalists were robbed at gunpoint while they slept in their chalet in Magaliesburg. The reporters were in South Africa to cover the FIFA World Cup, a football competition which starts on June 11.

A police spokesman confirmed that two gunmen broke into the journalists' lodgings during the early hours of the morning. One of the journalists woke during the break-in and was forced to lie on the floor by one of the suspects. Laptops and cameras were stolen, along with the reporters' passports.

The South African Press Association reported that two of the journalists were Portuguese and another was from Spain. None of the journalists were harmed during the incident.

Thousands of police officers have been organized for the World Cup. Around 350,000 fans are due to visit South Africa during the tournament.

As the world anxiously awaits to see if their team will win the World Cup, 

<h3>&lt;a href="Noynoy%20Aquino%20elected%20Philippine%20president"&gt;Noynoy Aquino elected Philippine president&lt;/a&gt; (4:03)</h3>

in the Philippines, the Liberal Party's presidential candidate Benigno Simeon Cojuangco Aquino III, commonly known as Noynoy, was officially elected as the next President of the Philippines in the 2010 presidential election. The Commission of Elections announced Noynoy's victory on Wednesday.

He campaigned for an end to corruption and poverty and says he'll make prosecuting corrupt officials a priority. Noynoy received more than 15 million votes, about 5.7 million ahead of his closest opponent, ousted Joseph Estrada.

Noynoy said in an interview, "I want to lead by example. We talk about corruption. I did make a public vow, I will never steal". Senate President Juan Ponce Enrile told a crowd after the count: "We have done this ... for the Filipino people ... This is a historic event."

He is 50 years old, a bachelor, an economics graduate, a Senator and is the only son of former President Corazon Aquino and former Senator Benigno Aquino, Jr.. Noynoy's father was shot by the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, before his mother, Corazon Aquino, led the People Power Revolution that toppled Marcos in 1986. She then served as president for six years.

In the Philippines, the president and vice president are elected separately; the Puwersa ng Masang Pilipino Party's vice-presidential candidate Jejomar Cabauatan Binay will become the country's vice-president. Noynoy is the President-elect, while Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo is the outgoing incumbent. He will officially become the Philippine's fifteenth president on June 30.

<h3>&lt;a href="Hospital%20in%20Essex%2C%20England%20fined%20%C2%A350%2C000%20after%20patient%20dies%20due%20to%20health%20and%20safety%20breaches"&gt;Hospital in Essex, England fined £50,000 after patient dies due to health and safety breaches&lt;/a&gt; (6:50)</h3>

Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, in Essex, England, has been fined £50,000 after a severely disabled patient at the Basildon University Hospital died because of serious health and safety failings. Basildon Crown Court also ordered the trust to pay costs of £40,000.

20-year-old Kyle Flack, who came from Stanford-le-Hope in Essex, was deafblind and suffered from quadriplegia, cerebral palsy, and substantial learning difficulties. He died in October 2006 after suffocating when his head became jammed in the railings around his hospital bed.

The trust admitted that health and safety breaches were a "significant cause" of his death, said Pascal Bates for the prosecution. There had been significant errors in the hospital's "systems and procedures", as the patient had not been properly supervised, training of staff was inadequate, information had not been passed on correctly, and warnings had not been heeded. Bates told the court that the hospital had reached "markedly short" of the required standard, adding that "[m]anagement failed to lay down correct procedures."

Earlier this year, Gill Flack, Kyle's mother, called for bosses of the hospital to be held personally responsible for this incident. She described the hospital as the "worst place" for her child to have been cared for, saying that the standards of care there were "absolute crap".

<h3>&lt;a href="Boat%20in%20Bangladesh%20sinks%2C%20at%20least%20twelve%20dead"&gt;Boat in Bangladesh sinks, at least twelve dead&lt;/a&gt; (8:21)</h3>

A boat in Bangladesh sank in a river in the northeastern part of the country earlier today, killing at least a dozen people — including some children — according to reports.

The incident occurred in the district of Sunamgonj, about 296 kilometers (184 mi) from the capital of Dhaka. The Chinese news service Xinhua reports that the bodies from the ship have been recovered. Government official Babul Miah said the boat was making a trip between villages three kilometers apart and he noted that six of the dead were girls headed to school.

Nine people are still reported as missing, and according to Miah, searches are underway for them. At least two dozen other people, however, managed to swim to safety or were rescued after the boat's sinking. An official said that 60–70 people were on board.

The cause of the accident hasn't yet been ascertained. 

Finally, moving onto a story that might not seem out of place in Bangladesh,

<h3>&lt;a href="Circus%20elephant%20escapes%20in%20Zurich%2C%20Switzerland"&gt;Circus elephant escapes in Zurich, Switzerland&lt;/a&gt; (9:15)</h3>

a circus elephant managed to escape from her handler on Sunday night in the city of Zurich, Switzerland before being recaptured by local police and circus animal keepers. The 26-year-old female elephant, named Sabu, is from Switzerland's Zirkus Knie. She was able to make her escape just before being put into a trailer, while the keeper was not paying attention.

Around 7:30pm local time, Sabu was seen wading in Lake Zurich for a short time before walking back onto city streets. Zurich police said that Sabu wandered along a busy avenue, an area which is known as the city's most exclusive shopping street. She also passed by the city's main rail station and Paradeplatz, a square where both Credit Suisse and UBS have headquarters.

</ul>
For nearly an hour, police chased the elephant around the city before she was finally peacefully recaptured in the Talstrasse section of Zurich. Circus officials and police followed Sabu, but a circus spokesperson said that she did not respond to their calls. Sabu was also said to have been moving so fast that police had difficulty keeping up with her. At about 8:00pm local time, a keeper was able to control the animal and load her onto a truck to take her to Winterthur, where the other circus animals were. There were no reports of any damage or injuries during the incident, and although police held back onlookers, at least one bystander managed to capture video of the event.

The circus said that Sabu may have escaped after being frightened by storms near Zurich. After returning to the circus, she was said to be tired, but "pleased to be back."

In 1973, Secretariat, an American Thoroughbred racehorse, became the first U.S. Triple Crown champion in twenty-five years, setting new race records in two of the three events in the Series.

Secretariat was the grandson of Nearco, patriarch of the most dominant sire line in Thoroughbred history as well as one of the greatest racehorses of the Twentieth Century. Like the equally famous horse Man o' War, Secretariat was a large chestnut colt and was given the same nickname, "Big Red." Owned by Penny Chenery (aka Penny Tweedy), he was trained by Lucien Laurin and mainly ridden by fellow Canadian jockey Ron Turcotte.

By the time Secretariat was a yearling, he was still unnamed. Meadow Stables' secretary, Elizabeth Ham, had submitted 10 names to the Jockey Club, all of which were denied for various reasons. Approval finally came with the 11th submission, a name Ham herself picked from a previous career association.

When Secretariat was finally 2 years old, he won 5 races in a row, including three important two-year-old stakes races, after losing his first race at the Aqueduct Racetrack on July 4, 1972. Signs of his future greatenss were apparant as during the Hopeful Stakes, in Saratoga Springs, New York, he made a huge move, passing 8 horses in 1/4 mile to take the lead and then drawing off to win by 5 lengths.

His triple crown run officially began in the 1973 Kentucky Derby. Though he had lost his previous race, he was a 3-2 favorite. Out of the gate, Secretariat broke last but gradually moved up on the field in the backstretch, then overtook his rival and stablemate Sham, whom he had lost to in the previous race, at the top of the stretch, pulling away to win the Derby by 2 1/2 lengths.

On his way to a still-standing track record (1:59 2/5), he ran each quarter-mile segment faster than the one before it. The successive quarter-mile times were: 25 1/5, 24, 23 4/5, 23 2/5, and 23. This means he was still accelerating as of the final quarter-mile of the race and tt would be 28 years before any other horse would win the Derby in less than 2 minutes (Monarchos in 2001).

In the Preakness Stakes, the second leg of the triple crown, Secretariat again broke last but then made a huge, last-to-first move on the first turn. After reaching the lead with 5 1/2 furlongs to go, Secretariat was never challenged and won again by 2½ lengths while also edging out Sham who finishing second again.

Only four horses joined Secretariat for the June 9, 1973, running of the Belmont Stakes, the last stop to a triple crown and once again he raced Sham. With so few horses in the race, and with Secretariat expected to win, no "show" bets were taken. Secretariat was sent off as a 1–10 favorite to win as a $2.20 payout on a $2 ticket and would pay at 20 cents more – $2.40 – to place. 

Before a crowd of 67,605, Secretariat and Sham set a fast early pace, opening ten lengths on the rest of the field. After the 6 furlong mark, Sham began to tire, ultimately finishing last. Secretariat astonished spectators by continuing on the fast pace and opening up a larger and larger margin on the field. In the stretch, Secretariat opened a 1/16 mile lead on the rest of the field. At the finish, he won by 31 lengths (breaking the margin-of-victory record set by Triple Crown winner Count Fleet, who won by 25 lengths) and ran the fastest 1½ miles on dirt in history, 2:24 flat, which broke the stakes record by more than 2 seconds.

5,617 bettors held winning tickets on Secretariat but never redeemed them, presumably keeping them as souvenirs (and because they only paid $2.20 on a $2 bet).

</ul>
Secretariat never duplicated his Belmont Stakes performance and only won one G1 race on dirt, the Marlboro Cup, but continued to run impressively after the Triple Crown. Altogether, Secretariat won 16 of his 21 career races, with three seconds and one third, for an in the money finish in 20 of 21 starts, and total earnings of $1,316,808. 

After his career he was put out to stud, and although his blood flows through many noteable horses, especially 2004 Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner Smarty Jones, the value of his offspring declined considerably over the years as none of his offspring were able to match his success. 

In the fall of 1989, Secretariat was afflicted with laminitis, a painful and often incurable hoof condition. When his condition failed to improve, he was euthanized on October 4 at the age of 19. Popular as a Triple Crown champion and in retirement alike, Secretariat was mourned by millions and buried at Claiborne Farm in Paris, Kentucky, given the rare honor of being buried whole; usually only the head, heart and hooves of a winning race horse are buried, the rest cremated.

It should be noted that the jockey who rode him to the triple crown, Ron Turcotte, saw his career end in 1978 following a tumble from his horse at the start of a race at Belmont Park that left him a paraplegic. Turcotte was immediately inducted in the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1979, was voted into the New Brunswick Sports Hall of Fame and in 1980 was inducted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame.

Turcotte still lives in his home town of Grand Falls, New Brunswick, Canada, with his wife Gae and their four daughters. He is an advocate for the disabled and helps to raise funds for disability programs.

<h1>News briefs:April 14, 2010</h1>
From Wikinews, the free news source, this is the audio Wikinews brief for Wednesday, April 14th, 2010. I'm Dan Harlow and here are today's top stories:

<h3>&lt;a href="6.9%20magnitude%20earthquake%20hits%20western%20China"&gt;6.9 magnitude earthquake hits western China&lt;/a&gt; (0:17)</h3>

At least 400 people have been killed and a further 10,000 injured after a magnitude 6.9 earthquake and its aftershocks struck the remote and mountainous Yushu county in the south of Qinghai province in western China. 

The USGS has reported that the tremors started at 07.49 local time and that the epicenter was located 240 kilometers north-northwest of Qamdo, Xizang at a depth of ten kilometers. However the China Earthquake Networks Centers estimations conflicted with the USGS statistics, putting the earthquake's magnitude at 7.1.

The head of news for the Yushu county television station, who was a witness to the quake, spoke to the state broadcaster CCTV about the incident, saying "In a flash, the houses went down. It was a terrible earthquake. In a small park, there is a Buddhist tower and the top of the tower fell off." 

An official commented that around 85% of the buildings in the town of Jiegu, located close to the quake's epicentre, were destroyed, and local official, Huang Limin was quoted by the Chinese Xinhua news service as saying: "Soldiers have been dispatched to save the people buried in the collapsed houses." Authorities have ordered supplies to be moved to the area, but Yushu is hundreds of miles away from any airport, according to the BBC.

The plateau where the earthquake hit is frequently visited by tremors; though casualties are rare due to its remoteness and small population. However, in May of 2008 an 8.0 magnitude earthquake struck near the Sichuan foothills, killing an estimated 80,000 people.

<h3>&lt;a href="Toyota%20to%20suspend%20sales%20of%20Lexus%20GX%20460%20over%20new%20safety%20fears"&gt;Toyota to suspend sales of Lexus GX 460 over new safety fears&lt;/a&gt; (2:04)</h3>

Toyota is to suspend sales of its Lexus GX 460 over new safety concerns following an unfavorable verdict from Consumer Reports - the first such warning in almost a decade. 

After conducting its standard emergency handling tests on the 2010 version of the Lexus GX 460, Consumer Reports became concerned that the rear of the vehicle had a tendency to slide out, which in real life situations could lead to rollovers. However, the consumer organization is unaware of any such incidents with the 5000 GX 460s sold since its launch three months ago.

Already embattled with ongoing safety issues with its vehicles, Toyota has been quick to act, though it did claim that the car was safe to drive and that it had passed internal safety standards. According to Toyota, "Lexus' extensive vehicle testing provides a good indication of how our vehicles perform and we are confident that the GX meets our high safety standards."

<h3>&lt;a href="Vatican%20criticized%20for%20cardinal%27s%20claim%20of%20homosexuality%20and%20pedophilia%20link"&gt;Vatican criticized for cardinal's claim of homosexuality and pedophilia link&lt;/a&gt; (3:12)</h3>

The Vatican prime minister who made comments Monday linking homosexuality to pedophilia has been severely criticized by gay rights activists around the world. 

Holy See secretary of state, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, said yesterday that instead of celibacy, homosexuality was responsible for recent allegations of child abuse by Catholic priests. He said, on a televised broadcast in Chile, that "Many psychologists and psychiatrists have shown that there is no link between celibacy and pedophilia but many others have shown, that there is a relationship between homosexuality and pedophilia." He also claimed to have documents of scientific studies proving his claims.

His statements were immediately criticized by several gay rights groups in both South America and Europe. The president of Italy's largest such group, Arcigay, Paolo Patané, says "The equation between homosexuality and pedophilia is a false, despicable and anti-scientific statement that affects the lives and dignity of millions of gay and lesbian people."

The president of Chilean gay rights group, Movement for Homosexual Integration and Liberation in Chile, Rolando Jiménez, said that the statement was "a perverse strategy by the Vatican to shirk its own ethical and legal responsibility by making a spurious and disgusting connection."

The cardinal's statements are not the first time the Catholic Church has made allegations of a link between homosexuality and pedophilia. In 2005, the Vatican prohibited men from becoming priests if they "showed deeply rooted homosexual tendencies." That move came shortly after a major child abuse scandal in the United States, and was also seen as implicitly linking homosexuality with pedophilia.

<h3>(5:06)</h3>

At least 30 insurgents and two Pakistani soldiers died in a fire fight between Taliban rebels and security forces in the Orakzai region of the North-West Frontier Province. Officials stated that the gun battle started when the insurgents attacked a military base with rockets and mortars. Army Lt. Col. Nadeem Anwar said that the attack "started at midnight and continued until early Monday morning”. 

According to local government official, Sajjad Ahmad, troops opened fire aided by artillery when about 200 insurgents attacked a checkpoint. Ahmad told AFP news agency that "[t]he attack was repulsed and up to 32 rebels and two soldiers of paramilitary Frontier Corps were killed". 

In light of recent events, the United Nations said that it might have to close projects for assisting the people of Pakistan as only one-fifth of the funds they had requested has been collected. The UN had appealed for 537 million dollars in February to aid the one million people dispersed due to recurring conflicts in the northwestern parts of Pakistan located near the Afghanistan border.

Martin Mogwanja, humanitarian coordinator of UN for Pakistan told reporters "The response by the international community to this appeal is inadequate," and that "humanitarian actors responding to the needs of the people are concerned that some of the projects may have to be suspended because of lack of finances."

Only 106 million dollars had been donated to the body, 20 percent of the total appeal. Mogwanja said that they were in dire need of the remaining portion of the fund and 1.3 million had been displaced in the northwestern parts of the country, against a total of 3.1 million last year.

Meanwhile, on Monday, five others died in attacks in the Abottabad District over the renaming of the North-West Frontier Province. Earlier this month, several people were killed during a political meeting to celebrate the renaming.

<h3>&lt;a href="Burial%20site%20for%20Polish%20president%20Lech%20Kaczynski%20draws%20objections"&gt;Burial site for Polish president Lech Kaczynski draws objections&lt;/a&gt; (7:17)</h3>

The bodies of Polish President Lech Kaczynski and first lady Maria Kaczynska are lying in state ahead of their funeral on Sunday. The couple died along with 94 other people when the plane they were traveling in crashed in Russia. They will be buried after a memorial to the crash victims.

President Kaczynski’s body was repatriated from Russia on Sunday while the first lady’s was flown to Warsaw airport on Tuesday. Kaczynska’s coffin was driven to the Presidential Palace while draped in Poland’s flag. Thousands of mourners lined the six mile route as her coffin was transported. The first couple will be buried at Wawel Castle on Sunday.

Both chambers of parliament held special sessions to honor the crash victims. Poland is currently observing seven days of mourning while Russia held a day of mourning this past Monday.

Russian President Dmitry Medvedev is expected to attend the funeral. President of the United States Barack Obama and Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper have both announced that they will also attend.

The &lt;a href="University%20of%20Southern%20California"&gt;University of Southern California&lt;/a&gt;'s football team was heavily penalized by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association"&gt;National Collegiate Athletic Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (NCAA) yesterday due to several major rules violations involving former player and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHeisman%20Trophy"&gt;Heisman Trophy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; winner &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AReggie%20Bush"&gt;Reggie Bush&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The team was banned from participating in all NCAA &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Abowl%20game"&gt;bowl game&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; s for the 2010 and 2011 seasons, as well as was vacated of all wins during the 2004 and 2005 seasons. The team will likely also be stripped of their national title from the 2004 season and will lose ten football scholarships per year for the 2010, 2011, and 2012 seasons.

The NCAA also criticized the university for ineffective monitoring of its student-athletes. "The general campus environment surrounding the violations troubled the committee. At least at the time of the football violations, there was relatively little effective monitoring of, among others, football locker rooms and sidelines, and there existed a general post-game locker room environment that made compliance efforts difficult," said part of the NCAA's report.

The rules violations, which were investigated by the NCAA over a four-year period, involved the team's alleged "improper benefits," given to Bush, as well as Bush's contact with an agent, which is illegal under NCAA rules until a player has left the sports program. It is also possible that this will result in the loss of Bush's Heisman Trophy. The NCAA report ordered USC to not be in contact with Bush for the current time.

"We acknowledge that violations occurred and we take full responsibility for them. However, we sharply disagree with many of the findings in the NCAA Committee on Infractions Report. Further, we feel the penalties imposed are too severe for the violations identified in the report," stated Todd Dickey, the senior vice president of administration at USC.

Meanwhile, Reggie Bush (who now plays for the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Football%20League"&gt;NFL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Orleans%20Saints"&gt;New Orleans Saints&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) also released a statement. "I am disappointed by the decision and disagree with the NCAA's findings. If the University decides to appeal, I will continue to cooperate with the NCAA and USC, as I did during the investigation. In the meantime, I will continue to focus on making a positive impact for the University and for the community where I live," said Bush. Bush denies all of the allegations brought against him and the university by the NCAA.

The report also included punishments for the men's basketball team, which was accused of violating the NCAA's recruiting policy on former player &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AO.J.%20Mayo"&gt;O.J. Mayo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The women's tennis team was also fined for allowing an unidentified student to use a university-owned credit card to place $7,000 in unauthorized phone calls.

Today on Wikinews : The Democratic Republic of Congo sentences two Norwegian's to death in a second trial; California newspaper The Valley News retracts a story similar to the famous 'Dewey Defeats Truman' incident; South Korea experiences a setback for its space program and, in history, the king of all wild things is born in 1928.

Today is Thursday, June 10th, 2010. I'm Dan Harlow and this is Wikinews.
<h2>Script</h2>
<h3>&lt;a href="Two%20Norwegians%20sentenced%20to%20death%20in%20DR%20Congo"&gt;Two Norwegians sentenced to death in DR Congo&lt;/a&gt; (0:38)</h3>

Two former Norwegian soldiers have been sentenced to death in the Democratic Republic of Congo for the second time, having been accused of spying and murder.

Joshua French and Tjostolv Moland were originally sentenced in September 2009, but lost their appeal in December of the same year. The latest trial was held in April after the Congolese Military High Court overturned the original sentences and ordered a retrial. The pair are reportedly intending to appeal their sentence once again.

The two men have been accused of murdering Abedi Kasongo while they were traveling from Uganda to the DR Congo on motorcycles. When their bikes broke down, they hired Kasongo to drive them back to Uganda. The pair claim that during the journey they were ambushed by jungle rebels and Kasongo was killed. The accusation of spying stems from the fact that the pair were carrying Norwegian military identification at the time of the incident.

Both suspects continue to defend their innocence, and Norway and Britian, as one of the accused holds dual Norwegian-British citizenship, both expressed their opposition to the sentence. A Norwegian spokesperson said that "Norway is a strong opponent against the death penalty, and we have been communicating this stance to the relevant authorities. We have received assurances from the authorities that the death sentence won't be carried out and we hold the authorities responsible for the well being of these two." 

A spokesperson for Britain's Foreign Office said that "We will be doing everything we properly can to support him in the coming weeks and months. We are committed to supporting any British national who faces the death penalty and our prime concern in this case is to ensure that no execution is carried out."

UK-based charity Reprieve condemned the actions of the Congo courts. A spokesperson said that "Each time the military prosecution changes their theory, the witnesses all obligingly change their story. It is now clear why the DRC's own constitution forbids the military from administering justice."

While the UK attempts to intervene on behalf of one of its citizens accused of murder, police in that nation are seeking the suspect in a murder in Scotland.

<h3>&lt;a href="Man%20dies%20after%20being%20shot%20outside%20his%20house%20in%20Lanarkshire%2C%20Scotland%3B%20murder%20investigation%20launched"&gt;Man dies after being shot outside his house in Lanarkshire, Scotland; murder investigation launched&lt;/a&gt; (2:39)</h3>

Anthony Wright, aged 35, was shot twice outside his household in Lanarkshire, in the rural town of Shotts at approximately 7:00 local time on Wednesday morning. An ambulance transported him to Wishaw General Hospital where he died later that day. A murder investigation has begun outside Wright's house. A completed report is expected to be submitted to the Procurator Fiscal later on. No other injuries were reported as a result of this incident occurring.

A description of the suspect's appearance has not been disclosed by the police and the police have not offered any motive for the crime, though authorities think that Wright was the anticipated target. Reports say that the suspect left the crime scene on foot, going across some wasteland and was last sighted at the rear of Inverkip Drive. One nearby resident, who is remaining unidentified, commented about Wright: "We don't know the man well but he had a boy at the high school and three wee tots. It's shocking really."

Detective Superintendent John McSporran urged individuals who know about the incident to speak with law enforcement, "I would ask members of the public who have not yet come forward and know something about this crime, to speak to police as a matter of urgency." 

<h3>&lt;a href="%27Dewey%20Defeats%20Truman%27%20incident%20in%20California%20State%20Senate%20election"&gt;'Dewey Defeats Truman' incident in California State Senate election&lt;/a&gt; (4:02)</h3>

An election news report in the U.S. features an error hearkening back to the infamous 1948 "Dewey Defeats Truman" incident – reporting the wrong candidate won the California state election primary.

On Tuesday, Candidate Joel Anderson, a member of the California State Assembly, won the Republican Party primary for the California State Senate's 36th District being vacated by termed-out politician Senate Minority Leader Dennis Hollingsworth. With 100 percent of the election precincts reporting, Anderson won over 45 percent of the total votes cast in the Republican primary.

However, The Valley News, a news publication based in Riverside, California, mistakenly reported that Anderson's opponent, Jeff Stone, had won the Republican primary. The Valley News later deleted its own article and revised the story with the correct information about the election results, without posting a correction.

California political journalist Barry Jantz reported that the mistake was due to the publisher of The Valley News only having examined the election results for Riverside, and not the entire election district. The Republican primary won by Anderson encompasses an election district, which includes both Riverside County, and San Diego County.

Jantz noted, "A new story has now been posted, without a trace of the incorrect report or a correction." He referred to the erroneous article subsequently deleted by the Valley Press as, "the story that was...and wasn't...and now never existed". The San Diego County publication, East County Magazine, commented on the incident, and characterized it as "an error reminiscent of the infamous 'Dewey Defeats Truman' headline."

Dewey Defeats Truman" was an erroneous front-page headline by the newspaper Chicago Tribune published November 3, 1948, a day before U.S. President Harry Truman won the 1948 presidential election against New York Governor Thomas E. Dewey.

Anderson will be the Republican Party candidate in the November general election for California State Senate. His opponent will be Paul Clay, a Democrat and teacher based in Riverside County. The district primarily consists of registered Republicans.

The Valley News and the Chicago Tribune aren't the only news services who makes mistakes, 

<h3>Corrections (6:14)</h3>

in yesterday's story (&lt;a href="Noynoy%20Aquino%20elected%20Philippine%20president"&gt;Noynoy Aquino elected Philippine president&lt;/a&gt;) about the election of Noynoy Aquino as the new president of the Philippines, our story implied that the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos had shot Benigno Aquino, Noynoy's father, when, in fact, he had been shot while in military custody during the regime of Marcos.

<h3>(7:27)</h3>

Chelsea, the London based football club and current Premier League champions, have confirmed that Joe Cole and Michael Ballack will be leaving on free transfers during the summer transfer window. 

The team reportedly stated they did not wish to offer Cole, an English international currently with the country's national team at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, another contract for next season. They also declined to offer a new deal to the 33-year-old German captain Michael Ballack, who has been missing out on the World Cup with injury.

Cole has been at the club since joining from West Ham United in 2003, while Ballack's previous club was Bayern Munich of Germany, arriving under José Mourinho.

Ballack was claimed to be "extremely surprised" by the news, having been on holiday in Miami, United States at the time of being informed, according to agent Michael Becker. Ballack had previously rejected a reduced-wage, one-year contract, and was once the highest-earner at Chelsea, with a weekly wage of £121,000.

Several sources believe that many top finishers in the Premier League, including runners-up Manchester United, are keen to speak to 28-year-old Cole, as he has been free to initiate negotiations since January. However, no deal has yet been confirmed to have started.

Finally, in science, 

<h3>&lt;a href="South%20Korean%20Naro-1%20space%20rocket%20explodes%20after%20take-off"&gt;South Korean Naro-1 space rocket explodes after take-off&lt;/a&gt; (8:45)</h3>

South Korea has lost contact with its Naro-1 rocket, just 137 seconds after take-off. The rocket apparently exploded when a flash was seen from an on-board camera and communication was lost. The loss of communication occurred when the rocket had achieved an altitude of around 70 kilometers and television cameras captured a white speck, presumably part of the rocket, falling into the sea. 

South Korea had initially postponed a launch on Wednesday due to problems with the rocket's fire extinguisher system, but the mission was cleared and at 5:01pm local time today, the rocket lifted off from Goheung's Naro Space Centre. 

Korea had hoped to use a Naro-1, South Korea's first carrier rocket, to launch a STSAT-2B scientific research satellite. The payload was intended to demonstrate technology for future spacecraft and carried an instrument called the Dual-channel Radiometer for Earth and Atmosphere Monitoring, or DREAM, which would have measured the brightness temperature of the Earth in an attempt to examine climate change and its effects.

This would have been the first Naro-1 launch to reach orbit and the launch cost South Korea an estimated US$400 million. The incident is seen as a major setback for South Korea's space program, which had been aiming to become the 10th country to achieve the capability to launch satellites, and the fourth Asian country, after China, Japan, and India. A successful launch would have helped South Korea to become a player in commercial space launches, an industry valued at around US$250 billion.

Maurice Bernard Sendak, an American writer and illustrator of children's literature, best known for his 1963 book Where the Wild Things Are, was born in 1928.

Sendak was born in Brooklyn, New York to Polish Jewish immigrant parents Sarah and Philip Sendak, a dressmaker. He decided to become an illustrator after viewing Walt Disney's film Fantasia at the age of twelve, however, his love of books came at an early age when he developed health problems and was confined to his bed. In addition to Disney, Sendak has said of his other influences, "My gods are Herman Melville, Emily Dickinson, Mozart. I believe in them with all my heart." Elaborating further, he has explained that reading Emily Dickinson's works helps him to remain calm in an otherwise hectic world.

One of his earliest memorable influences was actually his father, Philip Sendak. According to Maurice, his father would relate tales from the Bible - however, he would embellish them with racy details to jazz them up. Not realizing that this was inappropriate for children, little Maurice would frequently be sent home after retelling his father's "softcore Bible tales" at school.

One of his first professional commissions was to create window displays for the toy store F.A.O. Schwarz and his illustrations were first published in 1947 in a textbook titled Atomics for the Millions by Dr. Maxwell Leigh Eidinoff. He spent much of the 1950s working as an artist for children's books, before beginning to write his own stories.

Sendak gained international acclaim after writing and illustrating Where the Wild Things Are, although the book's depictions of fanged monsters concerned some parents when it was first released, as his characters were somewhat grotesque in appearance. Sendak's seeming attraction to the forbidden or nightmarish aspects of children's fantasy have made him a subject of controversy. The monsters in the book were actually based on relatives who would come to weekly dinners. Because of their broken English and odd mannerisms, they were the perfect basis for the monsters in Sendak's book.

His book In the Night Kitchen, first published in 1970, has often been subjected to censorship for its drawings of a young boy prancing naked through the story. The book has been challenged in several American states including Illinois, New Jersey, Minnesota, and Texas. In the Night Kitchen regularly appears on the American Library Association's list of "frequently challenged and banned books." It was listed number 21 on the "100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990-1999."

In an interview on NPR's Fresh Air, Sendak said that his depiction of the cooks in In the Night Kitchen (they had Hitler-esque mustaches) and the fact that they tried to cook the boy in their ovens were references to the Holocaust, a subject high in his thoughts especially due to his Jewish heritage.

Sendak was also an early member of the National Board of Advisors of the Children's Television Workshop during the development stages of the television series Sesame Street. He also wrote and designed an animated sequence for the series, Bumble Ardy, based on his own book, and with Jim Henson as the voice of the main character.

In terms of influencing others, Sendak has been a massive influence over the decades. While his books certainly have roused much controversy, on the other hand they have also charmed scores of parents and children alike with their unique illustrations and lovable characters.

A rescue operation is underway after sixteen-year-old &lt;a href="America"&gt;America&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAbby%20Sunderland"&gt;Abby Sunderland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , attempting to sail around the world by herself, lost contact with her family while in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Ocean"&gt;Indian Ocean&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Sunderland, from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThousand%20Oaks%2C%20California"&gt;Thousand Oaks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, had originally hoped to become the youngest person to sail around the world nonstop by herself. She departed from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMarina%20del%20Rey"&gt;Marina del Rey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , California on January 23, 2010 and was about halfway through the attempt when Sunderland's family lost communication with her Thursday morning. That night, an &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n plane was able to locate her 40-foot (12.2-metre) long boat, ♡❤Wild Eyes♡❤, which had lost its &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Amast"&gt;mast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; earlier.

Sunderland had been sailing amid a rough storm in the Indian Ocean early Thursday when her boat was flipped over. The mast broke off as a consequence. After losing contact, the teenager activated two manual &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Adistress%20radiobeacon"&gt;distress radiobeacons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , or EPIRBs, and a search-and-rescue operation was formed. As part of the operation, a &lt;a href="Qantas"&gt;Qantas Airways&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAirbus%20A330"&gt;Airbus A330&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was sent over the ocean by Australian authorities. The plane's crew was able to make radio contact with Sunderland, and confirmed that she was not injured and that her boat was upright, but was unable to continue sailing. The closest rescue boat, a &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; fishing ship, was about 24 hours away from Sunderland's location when she was found, and is expected to meet her later today. She was stranded about 2000 miles (3218.7 kilometres) southwest of Australia's coast.

This is not Sunderland's first obstacle during the journey. Near the beginning of the voyage, she made a stop at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACabo%20San%20Lucas"&gt;Cabo San Lucas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Mexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, after the boat's generators were not producing enough power. She resumed the attempt in February, but autopilot problems forced another stop at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACape%20Town"&gt;Cape Town&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; for repairs in April, and she had to give up going for the unassisted record.

Sunderland's parents, Laurence and Marianne, have vigorously defended against claims that their daughter was too young to be attempting such a feat. They have also been criticized for allowing her to depart the United States at the beginning of the year, because Sunderland would likely arrive in the Indian Ocean during the region's winter. Marianne Sunderland has said that Abby would likely not try "something of this magnitude again." Last year, her brother &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AZac%20Sunderland"&gt;Zac&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; had completed a circumnavigation when he sailed solo around the world at the age of seventeen. She had begun preparing for this journey at the age of thirteen.

Search and rescue workers in &lt;a href="Arkansas"&gt;Arkansas&lt;/a&gt; continue to search the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALittle%20Missouri%20River%20%28Arkansas%29"&gt;Little Missouri&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACaddo%20River"&gt;Caddo Rivers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for survivors of Friday's flash flood. At least nineteen people were killed when the flood swept through the Albert Pike Recreation Area campground in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOuachita%20National%20Forest"&gt;Ouachita National Forest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the southwestern portion of the state.

Initially, Arkansas governor &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Beebe"&gt;Mike Beebe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said twenty people were killed when the flash flood reached its peak at about 5:30 a.m. local time on Friday morning, but as of Monday the death toll stands at nineteen. Amongst the dead are at least six children under seven who died when what has been described as a "wall of water" swept away campers while they slept.
With no record of who and how many people were at the camp site, rescue workers initially thought up to 40 people were missing, estimating numbers from vehicles and camping equipment remaining. Temporary cell phone towers have been erected in the area, in the hope that survivors would be able to call for help.

Speaking to CNN on Saturday, Bill Sadler, an &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AArkansas%20State%20Police"&gt;Arkansas State Police&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; spokesman, said: "We believe there are still individuals trapped in the area." He added that "The primary mission of the Arkansas state police working with the local authorities right now is to get the living out of that area and locate the dead." Most of those who had thought to be missing have now been accounted for.

Survivors describe having to cling to trees to avoid being swept away. Others escaped by climbing into higher ground. Rescuers hope that those missing can still be found alive on these higher grounds. The flood swept away everything from automobiles to RVs and, though it pales in comparison to floods like to much bigger flash floods like the Big Thompson Canyon flood in Colorado of 1976 that killed 144, many people at the site of the disaster said they "had never heard of anything like this."
Surrounded by mountains, the camp site "filled up like a bowl", according to Chad Stover, a spokesman for the Arkansas Department of Emergency Management. The area where the flooding happened is known as a "flash flood alley". This is due to the hilly topography, which creates a bowl like effect that drains rainfall into smaller streams. That means if there's a lot of rainfall, it will all go into the streams that can flood very easily.

Before the actual torrent of water came, the waters of the Little Missouri river increased at a very rapid rate. At 2:00 a.m Friday, the waters of the Little Missouri river were just 3.8 feet, according to &lt;a href="United%20States%20Geological%20Survey"&gt;US Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt; river gauge logs. However, it surged to 10 feet over the next hour and peaked at 23.4 feet, which is almost 20 feet above the river's norm. It also exceeded the river's previous record by 10 feet. After the peak, the river dropped back to 8 feet by noon. 

Raymond Slade, a Texas-based U.S Geological Survey hydrologist and an expert on floods, said that the amount of rainfall could have exceeded seven inches in an hour, a phenomenon so rare that scientists call that a "100-year rainfall". Slade says that "This was much greater than a 100-year rainfall. That flood that occurred was much bigger than a 100-year flood, where those people were camped."

<h2>Script</h2>
<h3>&lt;a href="UN%20Security%20Council%20imposes%20more%20sanctions%20against%20Iran"&gt;UN Security Council imposes more sanctions against Iran&lt;/a&gt; (0:36)</h3>

The United Nations Security Council has passed Resolution 1929 imposing a fourth round of sanctions against Iran over its alleged nuclear program.

The Security Council voted 13 to 2 to impose new sanctions on Iran unless it reveals more details of its nuclear program. Brazil and Turkey voted against the resolution, while Lebanon abstained.

The sanctions do not include major blockades, but do include measures against Iranian banks abroad, a cargo inspection regime, and provisions that all countries shall prevent the supply, sale or transfer to Iran of battle tanks, armored combat vehicles, large caliber artillery systems, combat aircraft, attack helicopters, warships, missiles, or missile systems.

President Obama praised the Security Council vote and said, "This resolution will put in place the toughest sanctions ever faced by the Iranian government, and it sends an unmistakable message about the international community’s commitment to stopping the spread of nuclear weapons".

Brazil and Turkey criticized the sanctions, saying they could undermine further diplomatic efforts. They had previously offered to mediate the dispute, an offer which was accepted by Iran. Iran recently reached a deal with them to ship most of its enriched uranium to Turkey in exchange for low-level nuclear fuel to run a medical reactor.

Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula Da Silva said "Sadly, this time it was Iran who wanted to negotiate, and those who didn’t want to negotiate were those who think that force resolves everything."

Iran responded to the UN vote by threatening to reduce its ties to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and to continue its uranium enrichment program. Iran’s ambassador to the the IAEA, Ali Asghar Soltanieh, said "No matter how many resolutions are passed, Islamic Republic of Iran will not stop its enrichment activities, which is in full accordance with its right under the statute of IAEA and Non-Proliferation Treaty".

As Turkey seeks to relax restrictions on Iran, 

<h3>&lt;a href="Turkey%20sets%20the%20price%20to%20lift%20the%20ban%20on%20YouTube%20and%20Google%20services"&gt;Turkey sets the price to lift the ban on YouTube and Google services&lt;/a&gt; (2:41)</h3>

Turkey’s Finance Ministry has given Google a tax demand of $18.6 million, and Transport and Communications Minister Binali Yildirim called on Google to register as a taxpayer in the country to "help accelerate" the lifting of a ban on YouTube and Google services.

As The Register reported, access to search engine Google had been limited due to a block imposed on its IP set. Most of Google's online services had been inaccessible in Turkey since June 4 and YouTube, who shares IP addresses with Google, has been banned in Turkey since 2008.

Accoring to HaberTurk, which is the Turkish version of Bloomberg, Yildirim said that "YouTube is a tax-payer in 20 countries, and we want them to do the same in Turkey." 

Reporters Without Borders condemned "the growing repercussions of Turkey’s censorship of YouTube and quoted Turkey's President Abdullah Gul as saying "I do not want Turkey to be included among the countries that ban YouTube and prevent access to Google."

Several internet sites have recently been banned in Turkey. The Register reports that 3,700 websites are "blocked for arbitrary and political reasons" in Turkey, including foreign websites, sites aimed at the country's Kurdish minority, and gay sites according to The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Reporters Without Borders added Turkey to the list of "countries under surveillance" in its report on "Enemies of the Internet," issued March 2010.

The great-granddaughter of former South Africa President Nelson Mandela has died in a car crash following a concert to open the World Cup.

The Nelson Mandela Foundation released a statement which said that thirteen-year-old Zenani Mandela, who celebrated her birthday on June 9, died in a single vehicle accident and that no one else was injured. The statement continued: "The family has asked for privacy as they mourn this tragedy."

South Africa has a poor road safety record and ranks ninth in the world for traffic fatalities. Traffic safety is feared to be a threat of injury to supporters to the World Cup.

While the world celebrates the opening of the World Cup, in American football,

The University of Southern California's football team was heavily penalized by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) yesterday due to several major rules violations involving former player and Heisman Trophy winner Reggie Bush. The team was banned from participating in all NCAA bowl games for the 2010 and 2011 seasons, as well as was vacated of all wins during the 2004 and 2005 seasons. The team will likely also be stripped of their national title from the 2004 season and will lose ten football scholarships per year for the 2010, 2011, and 2012 seasons.

The NCAA also criticized the university for ineffective monitoring of its student-athletes. In their report, the NCAA said "The general campus environment surrounding the violations troubled the committee. At least at the time of the football violations, there was relatively little effective monitoring of, among others, football locker rooms and sidelines, and there existed a general post-game locker room environment that made compliance efforts difficult".

The rules violations, which were investigated by the NCAA over a four-year period, involved the team's alleged "improper benefits," given to Bush, as well as Bush's contact with an agent, which is illegal under NCAA rules until a player has left the sports program. It is also possible that this will result in the loss of Bush's Heisman Trophy. The NCAA report ordered USC to not be in contact with Bush for the current time.

Todd Dickey, the senior vice president of administration at USC, was quoted as saying "We acknowledge that violations occurred and we take full responsibility for them. However, we sharply disagree with many of the findings in the NCAA Committee on Infractions Report. Further, we feel the penalties imposed are too severe for the violations identified in the report,"

Meanwhile, Reggie Bush (who now plays for the NFL's New Orleans Saints) also released a statement. "I am disappointed by the decision and disagree with the NCAA's findings. If the University decides to appeal, I will continue to cooperate with the NCAA and USC, as I did during the investigation. In the meantime, I will continue to focus on making a positive impact for the University and for the community where I live," said Bush. Bush denies all of the allegations brought against him and the university by the NCAA.

The report also included punishments for the men's basketball team, which was accused of violating the NCAA's recruiting policy on former player O.J. Mayo. The women's tennis team was also fined for allowing an unidentified student to use a university-owned credit card to place $7,000 in unauthorized phone calls.

Finally, in archaeology,

<h3>&lt;a href="World%27s%20oldest%20shoe%20found%20in%20Armenia"&gt;World's oldest shoe found in Armenia&lt;/a&gt; (9:17)</h3>

What is believed to be the world's oldest shoe, over 5,500 year old, has been found in a cave in Armenia by a team of archaeologists.

The Armenian shoe is in a perfectly preserved condition and is a few hundred years older than the one found on Ötzi the Iceman, making it the oldest piece of leather footwear in the world. Researchers published details in the journal PLoS ONE.

The leather shoe was found in a cave dubbed Areni-1, near the village of Areni in the Vayots Dzor province of Armenia, on the Iranian and Turkish borders. "I was amazed to find that even the shoe-laces were preserved," recalled Diana Zardaryan, the Armenian PhD student who made the discovery.

According to researchers, the shoe, made of cow-hide, consists of only one leather piece and was probably customized to the wearer's foot. It was relatively small, measuring to the corresponding European size 37 or US women's size 7, however, it could have been worn by a man.

It was kept in excellent condition by a thick layer of sheep excrement, which acted as a seal, helping it survive the millennia. The shoe contained grass, although the archaeologists were uncertain as to whether this was to used to maintain the shape of the shoe and/or prepare it for storage.

"We thought initially that the shoe and other objects were about 600-700 years old because they were in such good condition," said co-author Dr. Ron Pinhasi from the University College Cork in Ireland. "It was only when the material was dated by the two radiocarbon laboratories in Oxford and in California that we realized that the shoe was a few hundred years older than the shoes worn by Ötzi the Iceman".

The shoe and the cave will continue to be researched. "We do not know yet what the shoe or other objects were doing in the cave or what the purpose of the cave was", said Pinhasi, "We know that there are children's graves at the back of the cave but so little is known about this period that we cannot say with any certainty why all these different objects were found together".

Currently, the oldest known footwear are sandals made from plant fiber, found in the Arnold Research Cave in Missouri in the United States. Sandals from the same age were also found in the Judean Desert of southern Israel.

Discoveries within the cave move early bronze-age cultural activity in Armenia back by about 800 years. Additional discoveries yielded an extensive array of Copper Age artifacts dating to between 6,200 and 5,900 years ago.

Today is Kamehameha Day, a public holiday of the state of Hawaii honoring Kamehameha the Great, the monarch who first established the unified Kingdom of Hawaii. While Kamehameha was king, Hawaii was a center of the fur and sandalwood trade. Pineapples were brought to Hawaii from Spain in 1813 and coffee was first planted in 1818, a year before he died.

The holiday was first established by royal decree of the ruling great grandson Kamehameha V on 1871. The first observance of the holiday happened the following year. Late 19th century celebrations of Kamehameha Day featured carnivals and fairs, foot, horse and velocipede races. Kamehameha Day was one of the first holidays proclaimed by the Governor of Hawaii and the Hawaii State Legislature when Hawaii achieved statehood in 1959.

Today, Kamehameha Day is treated with elaborate events hearkening back to ancient Hawaii, respecting the cultural traditions that Kamehameha defended as his society was slowly shifting towards European trends. The King Kamehameha Hula Competition attracts hula groups from all over the world to the Neil S. Blaisdell Center for the two day event.

The most important ritual is the evening draping ceremony which dates back to 1901 after the Territory of Hawaii was established. During the ceremony the Kamehameha Statue in front of the 'Iolani Palace on King Street in downtown Honolulu is draped in long strands of lei. The same is done at the Kamehameha Statue on the former monarch's home on the Big Island of Hawaii. Outside of the state, a similar draping ceremony is held at the United States Capitol where the Kamehameha Statue there is also draped in lei in the company of federal officials.

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; opened their &lt;a href="2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup"&gt;2010 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt; campaigns on Saturday with a 1–1 draw in front of a crowd of over 38,000 at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Bafokeng%20Stadium"&gt;Royal Bafokeng Stadium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARustenburg"&gt;Rustenburg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;.

England captain &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASteven%20Gerrard"&gt;Steven Gerrard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; put the English in front early with his goal in the fourth minute. The goal came as Gerrard was able to slip in behind the U.S. defense in the middle of the penalty box. The United States equalized in the 40th minute off a long-distance shot by midfielder &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AClint%20Dempsey"&gt;Clint Dempsey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The shot, from roughly 25 yards from goal, seemed like an easy stop until it bounced off English goalkeeper &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Green"&gt;Robert Green&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and in for a goal. Both teams had several chances to earn the go-ahead goal in the second half, including a shot by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJozy%20Altidore"&gt;Jozy Altidore&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that was deflected by Green and bounced off the goal post. A couple of saves by U.S. goalkeeper &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATim%20Howard"&gt;Tim Howard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; also played a large role in the second half.

The draw means both teams earn one point from the match which temporarily placed them in first place in Group C. Both teams play their second game of the World Cup on June 18 when the United States will face &lt;a href="Slovenia"&gt;Slovenia&lt;/a&gt; followed by England playing &lt;a href="Algeria"&gt;Algeria&lt;/a&gt;.

Other 2010 FIFA World Cup action on Saturday saw &lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;Korean Republic&lt;/a&gt; get off to a strong start defeating &lt;a href="Greece"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt; 2–0, while &lt;a href="Argentina"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt; blanked &lt;a href="Nigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt; 1–0.

On Sunday the first round of games in Group C concludes when Algeria and Slovenia face off. All four Group D teams will also be in action with Serbia taking on Ghana and Germany facing Australia.

&lt;a href="US"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt;, in response to criticism over his handling of the ongoing &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGulf%20of%20Mexico"&gt;Gulf of Mexico&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; oil spill, has asked the oil company &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABP"&gt;BP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to create a special fund with "substantial" amounts of money to pay claimants over the disaster.

Obama is to make his fourth visit to the Gulf Coast tomorrow, and on Tuesday is scheduled to make a speech about efforts to address the spill.

In a television interview earlier today, the president's senior strategist David Axelrod commented that "[w]e want to make sure that money is escrowed for the legitimate claims that are going to be, and are being made, by businesses down in the Gulf and we want to make sure that that money is independently administered so that [BP] won’t be slow-walked on these claims," he added.

The oil spill has poured at least a million barrels of oil into the Gulf since the Deepwater Horizon oil rig blew up on April 20. The oil has now reached the shores of the southern US, and affected many fishermen, oil workers, and business operators in the area.

Senior officials from the Gulf states of &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Louisiana"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; both want the oil company to put $7.5 billion into the proposed fund. Officials from neighbouring states also affected by the spill, such as &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Alabama"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Mississippi"&gt;Mississippi&lt;/a&gt;, haven't yet announced how much they want put into the fund.

BP's board of directors, meanwhile, is to hold an emergency meeting tomorrow to talk about compensation to those affected. Some economic analysts have suggested that cleanup costs and compensations could drive the company into bankruptcy, although BP commented yesterday that it was "not in discussions with" and had "not engaged any bankruptcy experts". According to the Los Angeles Times, as of March 31, BP had the equivalent of $6.8 billion in cash available on hand.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATraralgon"&gt;Traralgon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; reclaimed some pride with a thirteen point victory against &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADrouin%2C%20Victoria"&gt;Drouin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at the Traralgon Recreation Reserve and Showground. As a result, Drouin move to fifth on the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGippsland%20Football%20League"&gt;Gippsland Football League&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ladder and Traralgon reduce &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMaffra"&gt;Maffra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's lead on to to one game. 

The Gippsland Football League (officially Gippsland League) is the only major &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20rules%20football"&gt;Australian rules football&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; competition in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGippsland"&gt;Gippsland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; region according to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVictorian%20Country%20Football%20League"&gt;Victorian Country Football League&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Scores are quoted as ♡❤goals-behinds (total)♡❤.

A sturggling Drouin defence allowed early goals to Tim Johnston and Dan McKenna. The visitors struggled to get the ball out of their backline as Traralgon kicked and inaccurate three goals and six behinds. Drouin kicked two late goals to keep in the contest.

Drouin kicked five goals in the second quarter to take a fourteen point lead into half time, thanks to dominant midfield porformances of Andy Soumilas and Pat McGrath.

Steve Hazelman swung Nic Quenault onto McGrath with immediate success. McGrath gathered mandy poccessions but was not as effective as he was in the first half.

Traralgon got back into the match leading at the end of the third and went on to win 10-11 (71) to 8-10 (58).

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20Lakers"&gt;Los Angeles Lakers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; need to win tonight's 9:00 p.m. local time (0400 UTC) home game to stay in the 2010 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANBA%20Finals"&gt;NBA Finals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . 

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABoston%20Celtics"&gt;Boston Celtics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; beat the Los Angeles Lakers 92–86 on Sunday in game five of the seven-game series. The Celtics may have underperformed over the season, but in these &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2010%20NBA%20Playoffs"&gt;2010 playoffs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , they have been playing like the championship team they were two years ago. 

Though &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKobe%20Bryant"&gt;Kobe Bryant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; scored 38 points, there were no other other major point contributors from the Lakers. Pau Gasol scored twelve points, and Derek Fisher added nine points. The Celtics' &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Pierce"&gt;Paul Pierce&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; scored 27 points, and their other two "big three" players (Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen) scored 30 points between them, with Allen scoring 12 and Garnett adding 18. Rajon Rondo also had a good scoring game, contributing 18 points. 

For the final two games, if there are two games, the Lakers will have home-court advantage at &lt;a href="Los%20Angeles"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStaples%20Center"&gt;Staples Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Kobe Bryant is a proven scorer, and Pau Gasol uses his size to pick out rebounds. The Celtics have the "big three" group of veteran players and also Rajon Rondo, a potential superstar. After the Celtic's win in game five, and a three-thousand mile journey back home, the Lakers find themselves needing to win tonight to tie the series and deny the Celtics the win they need to wrap up the 2010 championship.

Women that came forward to the ♡❤St. Petersburg Times♡❤ said that those who did not wish to undergo an abortion were shunned by others within the Sea Org group, and were labeled as "out ethics" and "degraded beings". The Sea Org consists of 6,000 members of Scientology, who sign billion-year contracts to work for the organization for multiple lifetimes. Joining the Sea Org is considered a high calling within Scientology.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AL.%20Ron%20Hubbard"&gt;L. Ron Hubbard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the founder of Scientology, stated his appreciation for families within the Sea Org. Scientology's subsequent leader, &lt;a href="David%20Miscavige"&gt;David Miscavige&lt;/a&gt;, issued an order that children were to be banned in the Sea Org. The mandate by Miscavige asserted that children hampered the productivity of the Scientology order.
Scientology representative, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATommy%20Davis%20%28Scientology%29"&gt;Tommy Davis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; denied all of the assertions made by the women. "There is no church policy to convince anyone to have an abortion, and the church has never engaged in such activity. The decision to have a child or terminate a pregnancy is a personal decision made by a couple. That applies to all Scientologists. If any current or former Sea Org member ever 'pressured' someone to have an abortion, they did so independently, and that action was not approved, endorsed or advocated by the church," stated Davis to the ♡❤St. Petersburg Times♡❤. 

Another woman is suing the Scientology organization in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20federal%20courts"&gt;United States federal court&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and stated she was threatened with severe repercussions if she did not have an abortion. Claire Headley, 35, a member of the Sea Org when she was in Scientology, told the ♡❤St. Petersburg Times♡❤, "The policy was if a staff member became pregnant, that they were to have an abortion." 

In 1991, Headley became a member of the Sea Org at age sixteen, and began work with the division of the organization in &lt;a href="Los%20Angeles%2C%20California"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;. She married at age seventeen, while a member of the organization. Headley said that officials within Scientology leadership pressured her to have two abortions: one at age nineteen, and another at age 21. Headley believed she had "no choice", as she had witnessed other women that refused to have abortions instructed to perform manual labor, with one pregnant woman ordered to dig ditches. Headley said that during pressure to have her second abortion she was forbidden to phone her husband to discuss the decision. She spent a total of thirteen years in the Sea Org.
Laura Dieckman, 31, said that she was enthusiastic about beginning a family when she became pregnant within Scientology at age seventeen, but was instructed to have an abortion. In a federal lawsuit against Scientology, Dieckman stated she joined with the Sea Org at the age of twelve, and at age sixteen she married another member of the group, Jesse DeCrescenzo. She said she was pressured to have an abortion in 1996. 

Dieckman said to the ♡❤St. Petersburg Times♡❤: "I was pounded for two days by the top person in my organization ... about how the baby wasn't a baby yet, it was just tissue and it wouldn't matter if I aborted the baby." Dieckman left Scientology in 2004. In a video posted to the website of the ♡❤St. Petersburg Times♡❤, Dieckman emotionally recounted how she had immediately regretted going through with the procedure, "They will do an ultrasound before the procedure so you see the heartbeat. ... I'm lying there ... and I was like, 'No.' But it's too late. I'd already done it."

Natalie Hagemo said that 20 years ago at age nineteen, she was pressured by Scientology officials to have an abortion, but she resisted. Hagemo gave birth to Shelby on August 20, 1990. Hagemo's daughter was recruited into the Sea Org at age 14. Shelby contacted her mother a week later wanting to leave the Sea Org; Hagemo had a difficult time getting Shelby out of the group. It was not until this year that Hagemo told her daughter about experiencing pressure from Scientology officials to have an abortion.

The ♡❤St. Petersburg Times♡❤ received sworn depositions from additional women including Sunny Pereira, who said they were intimidated into having abortions they did not wish to undergo. "They put you in this position where you're weighing the lives of all these people you're supposed to be saving against this one little tiny speck of nuisance that's growing inside of you," said Pereira. Spokesman Tommy Davis stated the women were accusing Scientology of forced abortions because of choices they now "appear to regret".

In &lt;a href="Nevada"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republican party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; candidate for the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;United States Senate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASharron%20Angle"&gt;Sharron Angle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , was the focus of criticism for her support of a Scientology-associated program. Angle's opponent, incumbent Senator and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASenate%20Majority%20Leader"&gt;Senate Majority Leader&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Democrat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHarry%20Reid"&gt;Harry Reid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , took out a 30-second negative political ad critical of Angle for supporting "a Scientology plan to give massages to prisoners". The prison program Angle had supported was based on techniques developed by Scientology founder, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AL.%20Ron%20Hubbard"&gt;L. Ron Hubbard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Angle had previously been the subject of a similar ad in the Republican primary, generated by the campaign of her opponent &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASue%20Lowden"&gt;Sue Lowden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Sharron Angle is &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Apro-life"&gt;pro-life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20New%20York%20Times"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ columnist &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARamesh%20Ponnuru"&gt;Ramesh Ponnuru&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; noted her position against abortion helped her win the Republican primary. "Angle would not have been able to unite populist conservatives and beat the party establishment’s candidate had she been pro-choice," noted Ponnuru.

While testifying before the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASenate%20Armed%20Services%20Committee"&gt;Senate Armed Services Committee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , General &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Petraeus"&gt;David Petraeus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , head of the &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Central%20Command"&gt;Central Command&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , passed out briefly while answering a question from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Senate"&gt;Senator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="John%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="Arizona"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;. 

While answering the question, Petraeus slumped over in mid-sentence and the hearing was immediately suspended while several people rushed over from the table to help him. Shortly after, Gen. Petraeus regained consciousness and walked from the hearing room under his own power. 

The chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, &lt;a href="Michigan"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt; Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACarl%20Levin"&gt;Carl Levin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said the general "appears to be doing very much better." The senator also said that Petraeus was eating and may have been dehydrated, and that the hearing might resume. Petraeus was testifying on the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAfghanistan%20War"&gt;Afghanistan War&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

After a short time, Petraeus returned from the room he was in, smiling and sipping from a cup. Though the hearing was resumed briefly, given the circumstances, Levin postponed the hearing until Wednesday. As the hearing closed, McCain called the general one of the "nation's heroes" and also said "we're glad you have recovered and look forward to seeing you again tomorrow." As Levin sounded the gavel that closed the hearing for the day, applause broke out. 

Some people have speculated that Petraeus passed out because of McCain's questions, as the General slumped over while answering McCain. However, later General Petraeus said "It wasn't Sen. McCain's questions. I just got dehydrated."

Billionaire &lt;a href="Warren%20Buffett"&gt;Warren Buffett&lt;/a&gt;, Chief Executive of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABerkshire%20Hathaway"&gt;Berkshire Hathaway&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , auctioned lunch with himself on &lt;a href="eBay"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="United%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;2.63 million.

Bidding, which started on eBay a few weeks ago, attracted nine bidders, offering huge sums for the opportunity to have a steak lunch with the man said to be a "legendary investor". 
The winning bidder, an anonymous individual, will be parting with $2.63 million for a meal with the world-famed investor and has the opportunity to bring along seven friends for the meal.

This, the latest of Buffett's charity auctions, is providing funds to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGlide%20Foundation"&gt;Glide Foundation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a charity that provides food, health care, housing and job training for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco%2C%20California"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's homeless.

Over the last ten years, Buffett has netted $5.9 million in donations through such auctions.

<h2>Script</h2>
<h3>&lt;a href="International%20Committee%20of%20the%20Red%20Cross%20condemns%20Gaza%20blockade"&gt;International Committee of the Red Cross condemns Gaza blockade&lt;/a&gt; (0:39)</h3>

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) issued a statement today calling for an end to Israel's blockade of the Gaza Strip which it called a "...collective punishment imposed in clear violation of Israel's obligations under international humanitarian law."

The statement gave an overview of what the Red Cross viewed as a humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The ICRC described how the blockade has seriously impoverished the people of Gaza, as well as denying them basic access to housing, food and health care. The ICRC claimed the blockade has almost totally destroyed Gaza's economy which is kept on life support by an elaborate tunnel system used to smuggle in goods. Even though Israel stated it no longer occupies the Gaza Strip, the ICRC said that the country still denies access of Gazans to their fishing grounds, causing economic hardships.

The ICRC also outlined the condition of the health care system in Gaza stating that electricity blackouts are on average seven hours a day, meaning that hospitals must run on generators. Generators can take two to three minutes to start, a luxury many patients cannot afford. To make matters worse fuel reserves for the generators are running out, and the ICRC reported that already three times in 2010 Gaza's hospitals have run out of fuel.

Highlighting a potential risk to Gaza's water supply, according to the statement, only "60% of Gaza's 1.4 million inhabitants are connected to a sewage collection system." Raw sewage is dumped into the Wadi Gaza river and as many families live along side the river, the sewage poses a great health risk. Because of overused aquifers, Gaza's drinking water has "high levels of nitrate, chloride and salt" leaving the drinking water unfit for consumption.

The ICRC also urged for the rights of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, who is held prisoner by Hamas, to be respected, however, they recognized that, "Over 800 Gazan detainees in Israeli prisons have been prevented from meeting face-to-face with their loved ones since June 2007."

<h3>&lt;a href="Israel%20announces%20inquiry%20into%20Gaza%20aid%20ship%20deaths"&gt;Israel announces inquiry into Gaza aid ship deaths&lt;/a&gt; (2:51)</h3>

The Red Cross statement comes after the May 31st incident on a flotilla of Gaza-bound aid ships when nine Turkish citizens were killed as Israeli naval commandos boarded a vessel in the flotilla, the MV Mavi Marmara. 

Following a rejected UN call for an international inquiry, Israel will carry out an inquiry into last month's raid consisting of two non-voting foreign observers. 

The three-man inquest into the boarding action, which took place in international waters, will be headed by ex-Supreme Court judge Yaakov Tirkel. A retired military officer and a professor of international law are the other members. The two foreign observers will be Nobel Peace Prize winner David Trimble and a former jurist in the Canadian military, Brigadier General Kenneth Watkin. They are to watch the panel consider how the Turks died, as well as judge whether the naval blockade of Gaza is allowable under international law.

Middle East peace envoy for the Madrid Quartet, Tony Blair, said that he hoped that the Israeli blockade on Gaza would be softened within days, whilst the White House backed a Security Council statement calling for a "prompt, impartial [and] credible" review. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said that the inquest did "not correspond to what the Security Council asked for".

The Turkish government, however, is not satisfied with Israel's inquiry. Ahmet Davutoglu, the Turkish Foreign Minister, said in a news conference that Israel's "one-sided inquiry" is insufficient, and his country wishes for a commission to be set up under the control of the United Nations. Turkey has withdrawn their ambassador to Israel and canceled joint military exercises. It is calling for the blockade, which the Red Cross says violates the Geneva Convention, to be lifted.

In another part of the world where war and religious tensions have caused serious economic hardships, 

<h3>&lt;a href="US%20report%20says%20Afghanistan%20has%20significant%20mineral%20wealth"&gt;US report says Afghanistan has significant mineral wealth&lt;/a&gt; (4:38)</h3>

A report released by the United States noted that Afghanistan has nearly a trillion dollars worth of mineral reserves.

The report, authored by the US military, the US Geological Service, and the US Agency for International Development, stated that the total wealth in mineral reserves is upwards of US$900 billion, although Afghan President Hamid Karzai has said the value of mineral reserves in the country could be as much as US$3 trillion.

Resources claimed by the report include 421 billion dollars worth of iron, 274 billion dollars worth of copper and an undetermined amount of lithium, a mineral used in the batteries for many personal electronic devices. 

According to an Afghan official, the potential income from mining the reserves would be enough for the country to become self-sustaining, without the need for international financial aid.

US military official General David Petraeus said that there was "stunning potential" for Afghanistan, going on to say that "[t]here are a lot of ifs, of course, but I think potentially it is hugely significant."

A spokesperson for Karzai stated that "it's very, very big news for the people of Afghanistan and that we hope will bring the Afghan people together for a cause that will benefit everyone."

Analysts were less optimistic about the potential for a mining industry, however. Janan Mosazai, one such analyst, said that "I highly doubt it will be able to either properly manage these resources or use the riches to build a more peaceful and prosperous Afghanistan for all Afghans." Mosazai cited Nigeria as an example of a country that has seen increased violence as a result of abundant natural resources; in that case, oil.

<h3>&lt;a href="Women%20reveal%20accounts%20of%20forced%20abortion%20in%20Scientology"&gt;Women reveal accounts of forced abortion in Scientology&lt;/a&gt; (7:16)</h3>

Scientology is facing renewed criticism, due to an extensive exposé in the Florida newspaper the St. Petersburg Times which contains revealing accounts of women involved in the organization who say they were forced to have abortions. Multiple different female members of the Scientology group called the Sea Org said they were pressured to have abortions, and were threatened with separation from their families, hard labor, interrogations, and shunning, if they did not comply.

Women that came forward to the St. Petersburg Times said that those who did not wish to undergo an abortion were shunned by others within the Sea Org group, and were labeled as "out ethics" and "degraded beings". The Sea Org consists of 6,000 members of Scientology, who sign billion-year contracts to work for the organization for multiple lifetimes. Joining the Sea Org is considered a high calling within Scientology.

L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology, stated his appreciation for families within the Sea Org. Scientology's subsequent leader, David Miscavige, issued an order that children were to be banned in the Sea Org. The mandate by Miscavige asserted that children hampered the productivity of the Scientology order.

Scientology representative, Tommy Davis denied all of the assertions made by the women. "There is no church policy to convince anyone to have an abortion, and the church has never engaged in such activity." stated Davis to the St. Petersburg Times.

Another woman is suing the Scientology organization in United States federal court, and stated she was threatened with severe repercussions if she did not have an abortion. Claire Headley, 35, a member of the Sea Org when she was in Scientology, told the St. Petersburg Times, "The policy was if a staff member became pregnant, that they were to have an abortion."

In 1991, Headley became a member of the Sea Org at age sixteen, and began work with the division in Los Angeles, California. She then married at age seventeen, while a member of the organization. Headley said that officials within Scientology leadership pressured her to have two abortions: one at age nineteen, and another at age 21. Headley believed she had "no choice", as she had witnessed other women that refused to have abortions instructed to perform manual labor, with one pregnant woman ordered to dig ditches. Headley said that during pressure to have her second abortion she was forbidden to phone her husband to discuss the decision. Headley spent a total of thirteen years in the Sea Org.

Laura Dieckman, 31, said that she was enthusiastic about beginning a family when she became pregnant within Scientology at age seventeen, but was instructed to have an abortion. In a federal lawsuit against Scientology, Dieckman stated she joined with the Sea Org at the age of twelve, and at age sixteen she married another member of the group, Jesse DeCrescenzo. She said she was pressured to have an abortion in 1996.

Dieckman said to the St. Petersburg Times: "I was pounded for two days by the top person in my organization ... about how the baby wasn't a baby yet, it was just tissue and it wouldn't matter if I aborted the baby." Dieckman left Scientology in 2004. In a video posted to the website of the St. Petersburg Times, Dieckman emotionally recounted how she had immediately regretted going through with the procedure, "They will do an ultrasound before the procedure so you see the heartbeat. ... I'm lying there ... and I was like, 'No.' But it's too late. I'd already done it."

Another woman, Natalie Hagemo, said that 20 years ago at age nineteen, she too was pressured by Scientology officials to have an abortion, but she resisted. Hagemo gave birth to a daughter, Shelby, on August 20, 1990 who was recruited into the Sea Org at age 14. Shelby contacted her mother a week later wanting to leave the Sea Org but Hagemo had a difficult time getting her out of the group. It was not until this year that Hagemo told her daughter about experiencing pressure from Scientology officials to have an abortion.

The St. Petersburg Times received sworn depositions from additional women including Sunny Pereira, who said they were intimidated into having abortions they did not wish to undergo. "They put you in this position where you're weighing the lives of all these people you're supposed to be saving against this one little tiny speck of nuisance that's growing inside of you," said Pereira. Spokesman Tommy Davis stated the women were accusing Scientology of forced abortions because of choices they now "appear to regret".

In Nevada, Republican party candidate for the United States Senate, Sharron Angle, was the focus of criticism for her support of a Scientology-associated program. Angle's opponent, incumbent Senator and Senate Majority Leader Democrat Harry Reid, took out a 30-second negative political ad critical of Angle for supporting "a Scientology plan to give massages to prisoners". The prison program Angle had supported was based on techniques developed by Scientology founder, L. Ron Hubbard. 

Angle had previously been the subject of a similar ad in the Republican primary, generated by the campaign of her opponent Sue Lowden. Sharron Angle is pro-life, and The New York Times columnist Ramesh Ponnuru noted her position against abortion helped her win the Republican primary. "Angle would not have been able to unite populist conservatives and beat the party establishment’s candidate had she been pro-choice,".

Following a labour dispute involving soccer match stewards, South African police have taken over security duties for World Cup games in Cape Town and Durban. Security personnel staged a sit-down protest in the Durban stadium on Sunday, and walked off the job before yesterday's match in Cape Town.

The security workers are in a contract dispute with their employer, Stallion Security Consortium Pty (Ltd). Workers claim they were promised as much as seven times as much pay for a shift than what they are currently receiving.

Following the match between Germany and Australia on Sunday, workers staged a sit-in on the grounds of the Durban stadium and were attacked by police with tear gas and rubber bullets.

The 2010 organizing committee claims they are working on resolving this dispute.

Some South African unions have threatened to severely disrupt the country during the World Cup if labor demands are not met. South Africa currently has one of the largest income disparities in the world.

And finally, for fans of a sport without the annoying drone of the Vuvuzela, 

<h3>&lt;a href="Los%20Angeles%20Lakers%20need%20to%20win%20game%20six%20to%20tie%20NBA%20championship"&gt;Los Angeles Lakers need to win game six to tie NBA championship&lt;/a&gt; (13:46)</h3>

the Los Angeles Lakers need to win tonight's home game to stay in the NBA Finals after the Boston Celtics beat the Lakers 92–86 on Sunday in game five of the seven-game series. After the Celtic's win in game five, and a three-thousand mile journey back home, the Lakers find themselves needing to win tonight to tie the series and deny the Celtics the win they need to wrap up the 2010 championship.

Though Kobe Bryant had scored 38 points on Sunday, there were no other other major point contributors from the Lakers. Pau Gasol scored twelve points, and Derek Fisher added nine points. The Celtics' Paul Pierce scored 27 points, and their other two "big three" players (Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen) scored 30 points between them.

The Celtics may have underperformed over the season, but in these 2010 playoffs, they have been playing like the championship team they were three two ago.

For the final two scheduled games (should a game 7 be necessary), the Lakers will have home field advantage at the Los Angeles' Staples Center.

In 1667, Jean-Baptiste Denys administered the first fully documented human blood transfusion using about twelve ounces of sheep blood into a 15-year old boy, who had been bled with leeches 20 times. The boy, along with a second patient, a labourer, both survived though it was likely due to the small amount of blood that was actually transfused into them, allowing them to withstand the allergic reaction.

Then, in the winter of 1667, Denys performed several transfusions on Antoine Mauroy with calf's blood, who on the third account died. Much controversy surrounded his death as Mauroy's wife asserted Denys was responsible for her husband's death. Denys was charged with murder but was acquitted, and in an unusual twist, Mauroy's wife was accused of causing his death which was later determined to be from arsenic poisoning. 

After the trial, Denys quit the practice of medicine and his experiments with animal blood provoked a heated controversy in France, which banned the procedure in 1670. It wasn't until after Karl Landsteiner's discovery of the four blood groups in 1902 that blood transfusions became safe and reliable.

<h3>&lt;a href="US%20General%20David%20Petraeus%20passes%20out%20during%20Senate%20testimony"&gt;US General David Petraeus passes out during Senate testimony&lt;/a&gt; (0:44)</h3>

While testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee, General David Petraeus, head of the U.S. Central Command, passed out briefly while answering a question from Arizona Senator John McCain.

Petraeus was testifying on the Afghanistan War when he slumped over in mid-sentence and the hearing was immediately suspended while several people rushed over to assist him. Shortly after, Gen. Petraeus regained consciousness and walked from the hearing room under his own power.

The chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Michigan Senator Carl Levin shortly after said the general "appears to be doing very much better." The senator also said that Petraeus was eating and may have been dehydrated, and that the hearing might resume. 

After a short time, Petraeus returned, smiling and sipping from a cup. Though the hearing was resumed briefly, given the circumstances, Levin postponed the hearing until Wednesday. As the hearing closed, McCain called the general one of the "nation's heroes" and also said "we're glad you have recovered and look forward to seeing you again tomorrow." As Levin sounded the gavel that closed the hearing for the day, applause broke out.

Some people have speculated that Petraeus passed out because of McCain's questions, however, Petraeus later said "It wasn't Sen. McCain's questions. I just got dehydrated."

Senator McCain is also in no way responsible for an incident where

<h3>&lt;a href="Dozens%20killed%20in%20Mexican%20prison%20riots"&gt;Dozens killed in Mexican prison riots&lt;/a&gt; (2:04)</h3>

dozens of people were been killed in Mexico after two separate prison riots broke out in the city of Mazatlan.

According to the Public Safety Secretary, in the first attack, which occurred Monday, twenty inmates of the jail were shot to death after members of a gang started shooting at a rival group. Jail security staff managed to regain control of the prison, and found two assault rifles inside.

Another inmate was hospitalized and later died; three policemen were also wounded, and one is in serious condition.

Eight hours afterwords, another clash erupted, this time when inmates were stabbed by fellow prisoners, according to Public Safety Department spokesman Angeles Moreno. He added that police are investigating the cause of the attacks.

Moving onto a story featuring a meal one would not find in a Mexican prison, 

<h3>&lt;a href="Warren%20Buffett%20to%20host%20world%27s%20most%20expensive%20lunch"&gt;Warren Buffett to host world's most expensive lunch&lt;/a&gt; (2:52)</h3>

Billionaire Warren Buffett, Chief Executive of Berkshire Hathaway, auctioned lunch with himself on eBay for US$2.63 million.

Bidding, which started on eBay a few weeks ago, attracted nine bidders, offering huge sums for the opportunity to have a steak lunch with the man said to be a "legendary investor".

The winning bidder, an anonymous individual, also has the opportunity to bring along seven friends for the meal.

This, the latest of Buffett's charity auctions, is providing funds to the Glide Foundation, a charity that provides food, health care, housing and job training for San Francisco's homeless.

Over the last ten years, Buffett has netted $5.9 million in donations through such auctions.

As wealthy and influential as Mr. Buffett is, even he would have had to wait when

<h3>&lt;a href="Apple%20swamped%20by%20iPhone%20pre-orders"&gt;Apple swamped by iPhone pre-orders&lt;/a&gt; (3:44)</h3>

pre-orders of the recently announced iPhone 4 began Tuesday, overwhelming Apple and AT&amp;T.

Many buyers experienced issues connecting to Apple's website and customer service line. Some had difficulty finishing their orders online, while others endured long waits at Apple's retail stores due to the online issues. Some customers reported that Apple had set a recording on their phone lines telling people to call back at a later time, and others tweeted about their experience.

Since the original iPhone was released in 2007, web servers for both Apple and AT&amp;T have experienced issues at every new device launch. Today's glitches were apparently in the transaction authorization process, the point when Apple transfers information over to AT&amp;T servers. Other retailers, including Best Buy and Radio Shack, did not appear to be having the same problems.

Representatives at several Apple Stores in the United States said that buyers should try again tomorrow. Neither company made any official statement about the technical issues.

The newest iPhone, iPhone 4 was introduced by Apple CEO Steve Jobs at the company's 2010 Worldwide Developer's Conference less than two weeks ago. It is slated for a U.S. release on June 24, starting at US$199. Ben Reitzes, with Barclays Capital, estimated that over eight million iPhones will have been sold by the end of the current financial quarter, which ends on June 26. Shares of Apple Inc. rose US$5.41 yesterday in regular trading, continuing their trend of having risen 23 percent this year.

25 miles northwest of Moscow, near the village of Lozhki, sits the shortwave radio station UVB-76, better known as the Buzzer. Typically broadcasting on the frequency of 4625 kHz, the buzzer features a short, monotonous buzz tone, repeating at a rate of approximately 25 tones per minute, 24 hours a day. 

Despite much speculation, the actual purpose of this station remains unknown, yet because of the nature of the broadcast and the fact that its transmitter location is rumored to be a communications hub of the General Staff of the army, UVB-76 is widely believed to be used to transmit encoded messages to spies.

Commonly, this type of transmitter is known as a numbers station which generally broadcast artificially generated voices reading streams of numbers, words, letters (sometimes using a spelling alphabet), tunes or Morse code. They are in a wide variety of languages and the voices are usually female, though sometimes male or children's voices are used.

The Buzzer has been observed since around 1982 and on rare occasions, the buzzer signal is interrupted and a voice transmission in Russian takes place, however only three to four such events have been noted. 

Frequently, distant conversations and other background noises can be heard behind the buzzer: this suggests that the buzzing device is behind a live and constantly open microphone or that a microphone may have been turned on accidentally. One such occasion was on November 3, 2001, when a conversation in Russian was heard saying "[This is] 143. Not receiving the generator (oscillator)." "There's some work on the hardware."

Since the start of June 2010 the normal buzzing sound from UVB-76 has been replaced by a continuous high pitched noise, similar to that of a modem, with intermittent deeper tones like that of a foghorn.

While no government confirms the existence or use of these stations, in 2001, the United States tried the Cuban Five, five Cuban intelligence officers convicted of espionage for Cuba as well as conspiracy to commit murder and other crimes. Evidence showed that the group had received and decoded messages that had been broadcast from a Cuban numbers station.

It has also been reported that the United States uses numbers stations to communicate encoded information to persons in other countries.

Numbers stations appear and disappear over time (although some follow regular schedules), and their overall activity has increased slightly since the early 1990s. This increase suggests that, as spy-related phenomena, they were not unique to the Cold War. According to the notes of The Conet Project, a recording of many transmissions from these transmitters, numbers stations have been reported since World War I. If that is accurate, this would make numbers stations among the earliest radio broadcasts.

<h3>&lt;a href="%27Bloody%20Sunday%20Inquiry%27%20publishes%20report%20into%20British%20Army%20killing%20of%20activists%20in%20Northern%20Ireland"&gt;'Bloody Sunday Inquiry' publishes report into British Army killing of activists in Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt;</h3>
Thank you for downloading the Audio Wikinews Brief. Today is Thursday, June 17th, 2010. I'm Dan Harlow and today we present a special report on the Bloody Sunday Inquiry, a report into the 1972 British Army killing of fourteen civil rights activists in Northern Ireland.

The Saville Inquiry, a 12-year public inquiry into the fatal shooting known as Bloody Sunday, published a long awaited 5,000 page report, concluded the deaths were "unjustified".

The events of "Bloody Sunday" in 1972 saw soldiers open fire on civilians during a civil rights march. Family members and supporters of the victims reacted positively to the report, as they gathering outside the Guildhall in Derry.

"What happened on Bloody Sunday was both unjustified and unjustifiable. It was wrong", British Prime Minister David Cameron told the House of Commons. He also said, "[t]he Government is ultimately responsible for the conduct of the armed forces, and for that, on behalf of the Government, indeed on behalf of our country, I am deeply sorry".

Cameron said the Saville report states that those killed did not pose a threat and some of those killed and injured were clearly fleeing or going to help those injured or dying. 

Some of the key findings were;

"The firing by soldiers of 1 Para caused the deaths of 13 people and injury to a similar number, none of whom was posing a threat of causing death or serious injury"; Accounts by soldiers were rejected and some had "knowingly put forward false accounts"; The paratroopers shot first and later members of the official IRA fired a number of shots but this “did not provide an explanation for why soldiers targeted and hit people” and Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness of Sinn Fein, was "probably armed with a sub-machine gun" on the day, but did not engage in "any activity that provided any of the soldiers with any justification for opening fire".

Twenty-seven civil rights activists were shot by the British Army's Parachute Regiment (of which "1 Para" was identified as the regiment mainly responsible) during an illegal Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) march in the Bogside area of Derry in 1972. The NICRA was an organization, formed in early 1967, which campaigned against discrimination of the Roman Catholic minority in Northern Ireland and had five key demands: "one man, one vote"; an end to gerrymandering, housing discrimination, public authority discrimination and the abolition of the B Specials police reserve.

In the aftermath of Bloody Sunday, an inquiry by the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Widgery, justified British army actions on the day and claimed that many of the activists were armed with guns and nail bombs. Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader MP Mark Durkan said, "[t]he families have waited a long time for justice and for a long time the reputations and innocence of their loved ones have been smeared by the findings of Widgery".

The shootings lead to the strengthening of Irish republicans' anti-British army arguments in the Nationalist community and provided the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) with queues of new recruits for its "long war", which resulted in 30 years of The Troubles.

The 12-year inquiry is the longest-running and most expensive public inquiry in British judicial history, costing around £200 million. Around 2,500 people gave testimony, including 505 civilians, nine experts and forensic scientists, 49 journalists, 245 military personnel, 35 paramilitaries or former paramilitaries, 39 politicians and civil servants, seven priests and 33 Royal Ulster Constabulary officers. Evidence included 160 volumes of data with an estimated 30 million words, 13 volumes of photographs, 121 audio tapes and 10 video tapes.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFlickr"&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGetty%20Images"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have announced an extension on their one year partnership. The new deal will grant Getty Images access to all 40 million registered users images. To protect privacy, users must opt into the project, though details are yet to emerge. 

To ensure that Getty Images doesn't get free photographs, the owner of the image will be given a fee, however neither Flickr nor Getty Images have yet confirmed what those rates will be. It is believed it will be an industry standard rate, currently averaging between &lt;a href="US%24"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;150 and US$240 per image.

One such success story of the partnership is Hal Bergman. He joined Flickr in 2006 and has said the partnership, which he originally had been part of, had helped his career take off.

"I have been doing this for six years on the side and a year and a half ago I gave up my day job in website development," Mr. Bergman told BBC News, "I am working as a freelance and getting a lot of commission work and I would say this deal brings in about a third of my income".

Bergman has a total of 200 images used by Getty Images, and over 2,500 on another site, which he did not specify. 

The new alliance is said to help encourage people to retry Getty Images, as well as making Getty Images a far more competitive alternative to microstock photo sites. The move should also benefit Flickr, by making it more appealing to professional photographers to post their images on the site. It is still unclear what standards Getty Images will use for the licensing program when a customer wants a photo.

&lt;a href="Nicolas%20Sarkozy"&gt;Nicolas Sarkozy&lt;/a&gt; visited the &lt;a href="UK"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; today to celebrate the 70th anniversary since &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20de%20Gaulle"&gt;Charles de Gaulle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; made his war broadcast. The French president and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APrince%20of%20Wales"&gt;Prince of Wales&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; laid wreaths at the statue of Charles de Gaulle in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALondon."&gt;London.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 

Earlier, Mr Sarkozy and his wife Carla Bruni visited the &lt;a href="BBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; radio studio where the famous broadcast was made on BBC France. The broadcast at the time was said to have been listened to by a very small number of listeners. Carla Bruni and Nicolas Sarkozy unveiled a plaque and viewed a tapestry given to the BBC by France as a note of gratitude after &lt;a href="World%20War%20II"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;.

Nicolas Sarkozy and British PM &lt;a href="David%20Cameron"&gt;David Cameron&lt;/a&gt; met with 200 veterans during a ceremony at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Hospital%20Chelsea"&gt;Royal Hospital Chelsea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Nicolas Sarkozy awarded the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AL%C3%A9gion%20d%27honneur"&gt;Légion d'honneur&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to six World War II veterans, three of whom were British. 

In a short speech, Mr Cameron said the anniversary was a "reminder that Britain and France are not just neighbours in the geographical sense but also in the emotional sense." Mr Cameron held an hour of talks with the French president at &lt;a href="Downing%20Street"&gt;Downing Street&lt;/a&gt; primarily focusing on economics, &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, and other foreign policy matters. 
The visit is the first by a French president to mark Gen de Gaulle's broadcast on June 18, 1940. In the stirring radio appeal, Gen de Gaulle declared himself leader of the "Free French", spawning the &lt;a href="French%20Resistance"&gt;French Resistance&lt;/a&gt;, which went on to play a crucial role in defeating the Germans.

Mr Sarkozy's last official visit to the UK was in March 2008, when he was also accompanied by his wife.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeoffrey%20Hill"&gt;Geoffrey Hill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was announced yesterday to have won the election for the post of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOxford%20Professor%20of%20Poetry"&gt;Professor of Poetry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at the &lt;a href="University%20of%20Oxford"&gt;University of Oxford&lt;/a&gt;. Hill, who won by a large majority, is the 44th man to hold the post, but the first one to have been elected by an email-based voting system.
Hill, a graduate of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKeble%20College%2C%20Oxford"&gt;Keble College&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , has won many awards for his poems and other writing. He was described by ♡❤&lt;a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph"&gt;The Daily Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ as "one of the most distinguished contemporary English language poets" and by the former &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APoet%20Laureate%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom"&gt;Poet Laureate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAndrew%20Motion"&gt;Andrew Motion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as "one of the two or three best poets writing in English". He obtained 1,156 votes with his nearest rival, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Horovitz"&gt;Michael Horovitz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , receiving 353. In all, 2,500 votes were cast for the ten candidates. 
Speaking after the result was announced, Dr Seamus Perry from the university's English Faculty Board said that he was "simply delighted that a poet of Geoffrey Hill's eminence has emerged victorious." He added that Hill was "pleased" with the result, particularly as it came on his 78th birthday. Motion applauded Hill's success, saying that Oxford was "lucky to have him." Horovitz said that Hill would "probably give great lectures but they won't be anything different", and suggested that Hill, "like his poetry, won't be that accessible."

The 2010 election follows the controversy of 2009, which saw candidate &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADerek%20Walcott"&gt;Derek Walcott&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; withdraw before the contest after anonymous letters were sent to more than 100 Oxford academics giving details of an allegation of sexual harassment made against him in 1982. The eventual winner, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARuth%20Padel"&gt;Ruth Padel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , resigned after a few days when it emerged that she had briefed student journalists about the allegations. Perry said yesterday that Hill's election showed that "the chair did emerge intact from the scuffle."

This year's election was not without incident either. An eleventh candidate, Paula Clare, withdrew from the process complaining about pro-Hill coverage in the ♡❤Oxford Gazette♡❤, the official journal of the university. She said that the process was "seriously flawed" and favoured Hill. The 2010 election was the first to allow voting by email: previously, voters had to visit Oxford and cast their votes in person. The 2,500 votes in this election compares to less than 500 cast in the 2009 contest, as against a total potential electorate (all the graduates and academics of the university) in the region of 300,000.

The post of Professor of Poetry dates from 1708, and former holders include &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASeamus%20Heaney"&gt;Seamus Heaney&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AW.%20H.%20Auden"&gt;W. H. Auden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . It is said to be "the most prestigious" job in poetry after the poet laureate. The professor has to give three lectures during the year and to deliver every other year a speech giving thanks to benefactors during the ceremony for the presentation of honorary degrees. There is no obligation to write poetry for the university during the five-year tenure of the post, although past holders have taken steps to encourage student poetry. Hill will be paid &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Apound%20sterling"&gt;£&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 6,901 per year.

A 6-year-old boy and his father were shot and killed Saturday afternoon while eating inside a busy &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADel%20Taco"&gt;Del Taco&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; fast food restaurant in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Bernadino"&gt;San Bernadino&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, before the shooter turned a gun on himself.

According to the San Bernadino Police Department, 56-year-old Jimmy Schlager arrived at the Del Taco at 1:15pm PST (2015 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) on a bicycle, and, armed with two semi-automatic guns, entered the restaurant and opened fire on a family of four who were dining together. The employees and other customers all ran out of the restaurant and escaped without injury.

The father of the family, identified as 33-year-old Alex Trujillo, was declared dead at the scene, said the San Bernadino Fire Department. His wife and two sons were taken to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALoma%20Linda%20University%20Medical%20Center"&gt;Loma Linda University Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in critical condition. His 6-year-old son, Adrian, died shortly after. The victims each suffered two bullet wounds, except the mother, who police say received up to ten gunshots. The names of the 29-year-old woman and her 5-year-old son have not been released. Both remained in critical condition on Saturday night.

After shooting the family, Schlager, later identified as the woman's step-father, shot himself in the head. He was taken to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AArrowhead%20Regional%20Medical%20Center"&gt;Arrowhead Regional Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , where he later died from the self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. Police said Schlager had previously been arrested a number of times, on charges that included theft and assault with a deadly weapon.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALeongatha"&gt;Leongatha&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; got some measure of revenge against &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWonthaggi"&gt;Wonthaggi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; defeating them by 95 points in their round ten &lt;a href="Gippsland%20Football%20League"&gt;Gippsland Football League&lt;/a&gt; clash at the Leongatha Recreation Reserve. In their round one game, Wonthaggi won by one point at the Wonthaggi Recreation Reserve. 

The Gippsland Football League is the only major &lt;a href="Australian%20rules%20football"&gt;Australian rules football&lt;/a&gt; competition in the Gippsland region according to the &lt;a href="Victoria%2C%20Australia"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt;n Country Football League.

At the league's annual general meeting in December, it changed its name from the West Gippsland Latrobe Football League. At the same meeting, Wonthaggi joined the GL after dominating the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAlberton%2C%20Victoria"&gt;Alberton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Football League during the past decade. The Power made five consecutive Alberton Grand Finals winning three, losing only to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AYarram%2C%20Victoria"&gt;Yarram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (2007) and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStony%20Creek%2C%20Victoria"&gt;Stony Creek&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (2009).

Wonthaggi Power Football Club is a result of a merger between Wonthaggi Blues, a former Gippsland FL team, and Wonthaggi Rovers, an Alberton FL team. In February, the Gippsland Football League announced that Wonthaggi would be changing their uniforms, because their original one was similar to that of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWarragul"&gt;Warragul&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

In their round one game, Wonthaggi won by one point at the Wonthaggi Recreation Reserve. 

Around the grounds, Traralgon defeated Moe by 35 points, Maffra defeated Drouin by 37 points and Morwell defeated Warragul 35 points. Sale had the bye.

Scores are quoted as ♡❤goals-behinds (total)♡❤. Goals are worth six points, behinds one.

Leongatha's nineteen goals came through ten individual goal kickers while Wonthaggis five goals were kicked by three kickers.

Leongatha's Dwayne Holt kicked more than Wonthaggi's total score with seven goals. Nicholas Nagel (three goals), Tom Marriot (two goals), Hayden Browne, Sam Sperling, Jake Mackie, Ben Geitz, Dylan Westaway, Todd Mackie and Jason Casey were the other goal kickers for the hosts.

Pauls Brosnan and Phillip Young were the multiple goal kickers for Wonthaggi with Rod Tack adding the fifth.

<h1>Ailing social networking website MySpace loses co-president after four months</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Ailing%20social%20networking%20website%20MySpace%20loses%20co-president%20after%20four%20months&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANews%20Corp."&gt;News Corp.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the parent company of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMySpace"&gt;MySpace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , announced Friday that Co-President &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJason%20Hirschhorn"&gt;Jason Hirschhorn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has decided to leave the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Asocial%20networking%20website"&gt;social networking website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; because he wishes to return to his home city of &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;. MySpace is headquartered in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABeverly%20Hills%2C%20California"&gt;Beverly Hills&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;.

MySpace was founded in 2003 by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Anderson%20%28MySpace%29"&gt;Tom Anderson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChris%20DeWolfe"&gt;Chris DeWolfe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and purchased for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 580 million by News Corps. at the height of its popularity in 2005. In recent years, however, MySpace has been losing out in monthly unique visitors to similar sites such as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFacebook"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATwitter"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AYouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . According to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AcomScore"&gt;comScore&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , an Internet marketing research company that tracks website traffic, Facebook attracted 519 million unique visitors in April of this year, and MySpace just 111 million visitors. In response, MySpace has been recently shifting its focus towards music, games, and videos, and plans to continue doing the same in the near future.

Meanwhile, another failing social network, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABebo"&gt;Bebo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , was sold for less than $10 million by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAOL"&gt;AOL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to hedge fund firm &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACriterion%20Capital%20Partners"&gt;Criterion Capital Partners&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; this week. AOL acquired Bebo for $850 million in 2008. MySpace's reduced traffic and the departure of another executive have led industry insiders to draw comparisons between the two sites.

In April 2009, DeWolfe stepped down as MySpace's Chief Executive Office (CEO). He was replaced by former Facebook Chief Revenue Officer &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOwen%20Van%20Natta"&gt;Owen Van Natta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , but Natta held on to that position for just nine months. In February 2010, Hirschhorn was promoted from his position as Chief Product Officer along with Chief Operating Officer &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Jones%20%28Internet%20entrepreneur%29"&gt;Michael Jones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to the position of co-president. The departure of Hurschhorn leaves Jones to continue on as sole president. MySpace have said they do not intend on replacing Hirschhorn.

On Monday, the &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; foreign minister &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGuido%20Westerwelle"&gt;Guido Westerwelle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; visited Stockholm for his first time. He met with &lt;a href="Sweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;'s foreign minister &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACarl%20Bildt"&gt;Carl Bildt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , to coordinate in-depth views on matters such as the situation in &lt;a href="Gaza"&gt;Gaza&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Kyrgyzstan"&gt;Kyrgyzstan&lt;/a&gt;.

Wikinews was at a press briefing by the ministers. Carl Bildt started by saying: "We work closely together in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , now we had the opportunity to sit down and go through the agenda and coordinate issues. The relations between Sweden and Germany are good, and that is hardly news."

Guido Westerwelle continued, commenting that "we have foremost discussed the situation in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMiddle%20East"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . We emphasize that the decision of the Israeli government is a step in the correct direction, but we are convinced that there must be a total opening of the Gaza area. We want to support the moderate forces and help the life of people."

"This is also our common European view, and last week at a foreign minister meeting we agreed that full opening of the Gaza area is the goal. We work to influence our discussion partners in the Middle East, in particular the Israeli government, and also consider that the two-state solution without doubt is the only solution for peace."

Carl Bildt mentioned that they would have the opportunity for a short walk in scenic Old Town, Stockholm, and a short boat trip, while discussing further issues.

When asked about the situation in Kyrgyzstan, Carl Bildt told the reporters that "the situation is exceedingly worrying; the information we had over the weekend talks about the order of 2,000 dead and the order of 400,000 people who left their homes. This is in a very fragile part of central &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAsia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ."

"What we see necessary now is first to stabilize the situation quickly, then to be certain our aid is reaching people. There are talks about an international civilian police mission, to build the confidence which is a necessity for people to return. The situation is alarming."

Guido Westerwelle agreed, and said that "the first we do is protection of our European citizens, the second and very important is to protect the refugees so they have the chance to come to safe circumstances, and thirdly to stabilize the situation. Germany has started very quickly with a programme to help the refugees."

General &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStanley%20McChrystal"&gt;Stanley McChrystal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the top military commander for the &lt;a href="US"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; army in &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, was dismissed by president &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday, over controversial comments he made in an interview with a magazine.

McChrystal will be replaced by General &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Petraeus"&gt;David Petraeus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The move was made after McChrystal and the president held a thirty-minute meeting Wednesday to discuss McChrystal's comments to the ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARolling%20Stone"&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ magazine, in which he was portrayed as dismissive about the administration's handling of the Afghanistan war.

In one comment, when asked about vice-president &lt;a href="Joe%20Biden"&gt;Joe Biden&lt;/a&gt;, the general replied with "Are you asking about Vice-President Biden? Who's that?"; in another remark, he mentions an email from the US' special Afghanistan and Pakistan representative, Richard Holbrook, saying: "Oh, not another e-mail from Holbrooke [...] I don't even want to open it." One of the McChrystal's aides also described national security adviser James Jones as being a "clown... stuck in 1985".

Obama commented that the move was "a change in personnel but not a change in policy". "I believe it is the right decision for our national security. I don't make this decision based on any difference in policy with General McChrystal [...] nor do I make this decision out of any sense of personal insult," he said, commenting also: "The conduct represented in the recently published article does not meet the standard that should be set by a commanding general. It undermines the civilian control of the military that is at the core of our democratic system."

McChrystal, meanwhile, released a statement regarding the incident: "I strongly support the president's strategy in Afghanistan and am deeply committed to our coalition forces, our partner nations, and the Afghan people. It was out of respect for this commitment &amp;mdash; and a desire to see the mission succeed &amp;mdash; that I tendered my resignation."

The general's assistant who organised the ♡❤Rolling Stone♡❤ interview, Duncan Boothby, also resigned over the article.

&lt;a href="Hamid%20Karzai"&gt;Hamid Karzai&lt;/a&gt;, the Afghan president, meanwhile responded to Obama's move, saying he believed McChrystal was the best commander in the nine years since the US began operations in his country.

"General McChrystal was an important and trusted partner for the Afghan government and Afghan people and we hoped this wouldn't happen," said &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWaheed%20Omer"&gt;Waheed Omer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a spokesman for Karzai. "However, this is an internal matter for the US government and we respect the decision of President Obama. We are looking forward to working with General Petraeus, a very experienced soldier, who President Karzai knows well."

On Tuesday, &lt;a href="NASCAR"&gt;NASCAR&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASprint%20Cup%20Series"&gt;Sprint Cup Series&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; driver &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABobby%20Labonte"&gt;Bobby Labonte&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ended his contract with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATRG%20Motorsports"&gt;TRG Motorsports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; because of the possibility of becoming a "&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Astart%20and%20park"&gt;start and park&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; " racer because the team could not find sponsorship. Labonte said, "I just don't want to do it, I don't want to do the start and park thing." The move became public earlier this week.

After leaving the team, Labonte will drive for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARobby%20Gordon%20Motorsports"&gt;Robby Gordon Motorsports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;a href="New%20Hampshire"&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/a&gt; this weekend, then for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APhoenix%20Racing"&gt;Phoenix Racing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for the following two events. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARobby%20Gordon"&gt;Robby Gordon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said Labonte may be able to race later in the summer, but for now it is a one race only deal. Labonte also stated, "We didn't have the success that we really wanted, and kind of got to the point where Kevin was in a position that he was going to have to do some start and park races". 

Gordon hopes to have Labonte in the car for more races, so his team can learn from the former Sprint Cup Series Drivers' Championship winner.

&lt;a href="Slovakia"&gt;Slovakia&lt;/a&gt; eliminated defending champions &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; from the World Cup. First round groups E and F were decided on Thursday: &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Paraguay"&gt;Paraguay&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; progress alongside Slovakia.

When a team finishes third or fourth in a group, they are on their way home. After the elimination of France, runners-up in 2006, it was the turn of the reigning champions. Slovakia met Italy in their first &lt;a href="2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup"&gt;World Cup finals&lt;/a&gt; as an independent country.

After 81 minutes, the ♡❤Azzuri♡❤ (Italy) were down by two goals, both struck by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AR%C3%B3bert%20Vittek"&gt;Róbert Vittek&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , when they got one back. They were denied a chance to equalize by a rebound from a Slovak knee on the goal line. 

Their next goal was disallowed as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOffside%20%28association%20football%29"&gt;offside&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The Slovaks strengthened their lead when a gross positioning error by Italy led to a goal from a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACorner%20kick"&gt;corner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Italy scored their second goal in the closing moments of the game, but it wasn't enough, and the Azzuri were out of the tournament.

For the fourth time in history, the reigning world champion was eliminated in the first round. The previous occasions were Italy in 1950, Brazil in 1966 and France in 2002.

Also on Thursday, Japan achieved a surprise 3 – 1 defeat of &lt;a href="Denmark"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt;. This, along with their victory over Cameroon on June 14, secured their qualification. Paraguay stamped their ticket for the round of sixteen in a nil–nil draw with &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;'s ♡❤All Whites♡❤. The draw gave New Zealand a point to take them ahead of Italy, finishing Group F in third place. The All Whites leave the tournament undefeated, recalling Cameroon's elimination in 1982 after three draws, pipped by Italy on goals scored. The Netherlands beat &lt;a href="Cameroon"&gt;Cameroon&lt;/a&gt;, securing Group E's first place.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASpain%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has qualified for the second round of the &lt;a href="2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup"&gt;2010 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt; after beating &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChile%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 2-1.

Early in the match, the Chilean team tried to suffocate the Spanish. After a long shot in the twenty-fourth minute, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Villa"&gt;David Villa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; scored the first goal when &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AClaudio%20Bravo%20%28footballer%29"&gt;Claudio Bravo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; left the goal open. Iniesta scored Spain's second goal in the thirty-seventh minute.

Chile pressed the Spanish players in the second half, and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARodrigo%20Millar"&gt;Rodrigo Millar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; scored the first and only goal for Chile. The game then calmed down as both were going to qualify.

Celebrations in &lt;a href="Santiago%2C%20Chile"&gt;Santiago de Chile&lt;/a&gt; after Chile's qualification ended with 140 arrests, despite a special security program by the ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACarabineros%20de%20Chile"&gt;Carabineros&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤

Ms Gardner has hired fellow journalist and former broadcasting executive Robert Harris to carry out this study. Ms Gardner and Mr Harris worked together for seventeen years at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.

In early May Wikipedia co-founder &lt;a href="Jimmy%20Wales"&gt;Jimmy Wales&lt;/a&gt; deleted scores of images which were targeted as possible pornography, despite community resistance to the campaign. Wales eventually surrendered his rights to delete files, but the controversy over the perceived censorship caused many long-term contributors to rethink their involvement - some have curtailed the time they invest in the site while others have left the project entirely.

Commons Administrator expressed his frustration over the deletions when he spoke to Wikinews last month. "He [Wales] basically lied to us from the start. First, by acting as if this was for legal reasons. Second, by pretending he was listening to us, right up to his art deletion." The community irritation led to current efforts to draft a policy regarding sexual content for the site which hosts millions of openly-licensed media.

The Foundation's response is a measured one, according to Foundation Board of Trustees member . "The board thinks that this is an important issue," he told Wikinews yesterday, "we realise that there are many point of view on this. The one thing we don't want to do is draw hasty conclusions. We have therefore asked Sue to do more research into the matter. Our aim would be to get a complete picture of all the aspects and then see if we need next steps. If there are to be next steps, we will take these together with the community."

Last week, &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Consumer%20Product%20Safety%20Commission"&gt;Consumer Product Safety Commission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (CPSC) held a press conference on the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Mall"&gt;National Mall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;a href="Washington%2C%20DC"&gt;Washington, DC&lt;/a&gt;, warning consumers of the dangers of fireworks, and advising them of safe handling. They were joined by representatives from the the &lt;a href="Bureau%20of%20Alcohol%2C%20Tobacco%2C%20Firearms%20and%20Explosives"&gt;Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms&lt;/a&gt; (ATF); &lt;a href="Federal%20Emergency%20Management%20Agency"&gt;Federal Emergency Management Agency&lt;/a&gt; (FEMA); the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Customs%20and%20Border%20Protection"&gt;U.S. Customs and Border Protection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (CBP); and other national safety agencies. Fireworks are often used to celebrate the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;' July 4, 1776 independence from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain"&gt;Great Britain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFourth%20of%20July"&gt;Fourth of July&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is a time when many US families get together to celebrate, by holding reunions, picnics, barbecues, baseball games and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Afirework"&gt;firework&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; displays; however, celebrations often turn sour due to injury or even death, caused by the mishandling of fireworks. In 2009, nearly 19,000 fireworks-related injuries were treated in hospitals, doctors' offices and clinics all over the country. Around 9,000 of those were to children aged under 18, and 6,000 occurred during the 30 days surrounding Independence Day.

CPSC chairman, Inez Tenenbaum, said that burns and cuts to limbs, the face and head were the most common injuries, and over half of them were due to firecrackers, rockets and sparklers. The agencies were joined at the news conference by Jason Henderson, who was injured in 2007 after building home-made fireworks. He had found instructions online detailing how to build &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AM-80"&gt;M-80&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -style fireworks, and after purchasing the chemicals, began assembling them; however, the mixture exploded which resulted in him losing both hands and his right eye, and shrapnel caused multiple lacerations and puncture wounds to his entire body. "Don't be the show, go and enjoy the show. I want to get people to move away from putting on their own displays and just go and enjoy the free shows. I mean they are free," Henderson said. "You might as well take advantage of them while they are there. You can spend time with your family instead of being the one to light them and taking that risk." Henderson also appears in a public-service announcement recently released by the ATF to &lt;a href="YouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, that shows how he has now been fitted with bionic arms.

Agencies recommend attending community fireworks shows held by city or county officials, which are held in a more controlled and professional environment. Additionally, many jurisdictions outlaw either all fireworks, or certain types, such as rockets and firecrackers.

Fireworks increase demands on fire departments and personnel at this time of year, acting U.S. Fire Administrator Glenn Gaines noted. "Four firefighters [have been killed] as a result of illegal fireworks. Calls to EMS &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEmergency%20medical%20services"&gt;Emergency Medical Services&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and fire departments increased as individuals continue to be injured and burned." The dry weather and heat that many areas are experiencing also elevate the risk of brush and structure fires. The National Fire Protection Association said that over 22,500 fires started from fireworks in 2008.

Consumers who do purchase fireworks are encouraged to follow the following common sense rules: always read and follow directions; always supervise older children and teenagers if they are permitted to use fireworks; never allow young children to play with or ignite fireworks, child-friendly sparklers and "party-poppers" are a fun and safe alternative for them; keep animals inside or well away from the fireworks, the noise will often scare them; never light any fireworks inside buildings; light fireworks on a smooth, flat surface away from houses, dry leaves, and flammable materials; never ignite fireworks in metal or glass containers; light one firework at a time; move away to a safe distance immediately after lighting a firework; never return to a firework that has not ignited properly; never throw fireworks at another person, animal, or property; do not consume alcohol when using fireworks; keep a bucket of water or a hose in close proximity in case of fire, dispose of use fireworks in the bucket of water; buy from reliable dealers; only use legal fireworks; and follow the laws of your jurisdiction.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMorwell"&gt;Morwell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have moved into second spot after a 37 point victory over &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATraralgon"&gt;Traralgon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in their round 12 &lt;a href="Gippsland%20Football%20League"&gt;Gippsland Football League&lt;/a&gt; clash.

Traralgon led at the end of both the first and second quarters before Morwell kicked nine goals to three in the second half to record a 15-17 (107) to 9-16 (70) victory.

Morwell now sit in second place 1.46% ahead of Traralgon with Maffra two games ahead on top. Drouin and Leoongatha complete the top five with Moe sitting 5.78% out of the finals in sixth.

Sale are a game further back and Wonthaggi need to win two games to reach the final five. Warragul, who had the bye in round 12, remain winless.

The Gippsland Football League is the only major competition in the south eastern rural region between Melbourne and the New South Wales border according to the Victorian Country Football League.

The Northeastern region of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; has been blanketed by a severe heat wave since Sunday, with temperatures predicted to reach over a hundred degrees Fahrenheit Tuesday.

The US &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Weather%20Service"&gt;National Weather Service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (NWS) issued warnings of severe heat for most of the East Coast as well as some inland states, which are predicted to have temperatures as high as 102 degrees Fahrenheit. Factoring in humidity levels in a measurement called a heat index, temperatures will be even higher; &lt;a href="New%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;'s heat index could reach 107 degrees.

An NWS meteorologist, Brian Korty in &lt;a href="Maryland"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt;, said that hot air is "sitting over the top of us, and it's not really going to budge much for the next day or two," after which cooler air coming from the Atlantic Ocean is expected to arrive.

Officials warned of health risks from the high heat; an NWS statement said to "check on your elderly relatives and neighbors. Coaches, trainers, camp counselors should remain alert for signs of heat exhaustion and heat stroke. It will be so hot this afternoon that the weather could affect anyone no matter their age or overall health. Please consider postponing strenuous activities or work outs."

Electric utility companies are concerned about the effect of the heat on infrastructure; New York's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AConsolidated%20Edison"&gt;Consolidated Edison&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said that several hundred people were without power Tuesday morning. In Philadelphia, as many as 8,000 people were without power Monday; the number has decreased to around 400, but is expected to rise again later on Tuesday.

&lt;a href="BP"&gt;BP&lt;/a&gt; reported Tuesday that it captured nearly 25,000 barrels of crude oil on Monday from the &lt;a href="Deepwater%20Horizon%20drilling%20rig%20explosion"&gt;Deepwater Horizon oil spill&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico"&gt;Gulf of Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. The energy company also reported that a third of the oil captured was subsequently burned off. This indicates that the oil spill recovery operations may have begun to stabilize, even as strong storms threaten to hinder efforts.

As of July 5, BP has collected about 657,300 barrels of oil, with an estimated flow rate of about 12,000 to 19,000 barrels per day. As recovery efforts progress, responders hope to increase these efforts by bringing in additional ships to raise the average oil capture rate to 53,000 barrels per day. However, this latest effort was delayed by the recent &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Alex%20%282010%29"&gt;Hurricane Alex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , bringing operations to a halt for three days. 

BP plans to expand its containment capacity and flexibility, which is anticipated to occur during mid to late July. It is planned that several oil containment systems will be deployed; however, the efficiency of these systems cannot be guaranteed, as they have not been tested in the conditions they are expected to operate in. Work on the first two relief wells, which began in May, continues and is expected to take a total of about three months.

The Deepwater Horizon oil spill is the worst offshore oil spill in &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; history, and BP reports that recovery operations thus far have amounted to a total of about US$3.12 billion. The spill began in April when a drilling rig, the Deepwater Horizon, exploded and subsequently sank, killing eleven.

The &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href="Uruguay"&gt;Uruguay&lt;/a&gt; in the semifinals of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup"&gt;2010 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on Tuesday. Uruguay was the last &lt;a href="South%20America"&gt;South America&lt;/a&gt;n team holdout in the tournament. This year's World Cup is is being hosted by &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGiovanni%20van%20Bronckhorst"&gt;Giovanni van Bronckhorst&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; scored for the Dutch with a 35-yard shot in the eighteenth minute, while Uruguay's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADiego%20Forlan"&gt;Diego Forlan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; scored his fourth goal in this year's World Cup to tie in the 41st minute. 

However, after the Netherlands' coach &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABert%20van%20Marwijk"&gt;Bert van Marwijk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; replaced &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADemy%20de%20Zeeuw"&gt;Demy de Zeeuw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with attacker &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARafael%20van%20der%20Vaart"&gt;Rafael van der Vaart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at halftime, the Dutch went on a roll, with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWesley%20Sneijder"&gt;Wesley Sneijder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AArjen%20Robben"&gt;Arjen Robben&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; both scoring in the second half. They scored in quick succession, in the 70th and 73rd minutes, respectively. Uruguay later narrowed the Dutch's lead to one point in injury time, but the orange-clad Dutch beat back late Uruguayan pressure after the injury time goal was scored.

The Dutch team was jubilant after their semifinal win. "This is unforgettable," Sneijder said. "It was a tough fight and toward the end we complicated matters. Sunday we play in the World Cup final. I have to get used to that."

Coach Bert van Marwijk was also happy. "This is very special. After 32 years we play the final again. Such a small country. We can be very proud of this." Van Marwijk has been coach of the Netherlands for two years.

Fans of the Netherlands' soccer team were wildly celebrating too. 45 minutes after the small Western European country won, many fans returned to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACape%20Town"&gt;Cape Town&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Point%20Stadium"&gt;Green Point Stadium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to see the players do a victory dance. Many of the fans beat drums and cheered "Holland! Holland! Holland!"

The Dutch will face either &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; Sunday in the World Cup finals. This will be their first World Cup final appearance since 1978, when they lost 3-1 to Argentina, who was playing on their home turf. The Dutch also lost the championship in 1974. Uruguay hadn't appeared in the semifinals since 1970. However, they won the World Cup in 1930, and again in 1950, but they have since suffered a 60-year drought, which continues to this day.

A fan fell 30 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Afoot%20%28unit%29"&gt;feet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from the club-concourse level into the lower-level seating area at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARangers%20Ballpark%20in%20Arlington"&gt;Rangers Ballpark in Arlington&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATexas%20Rangers%20%28baseball%29"&gt;Texas Rangers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ' home game against the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACleveland%20Indians"&gt;Cleveland Indians&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Tuesday night. 

The incident occurred in the bottom of the 5th inning with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANelson%20Cruz"&gt;Nelson Cruz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at bat for the Rangers. Cruz hit a foul ball into the crowd. The fan leaned over the railing to grab the ball and fell over the railing and into the crowd 30 feet below. Play was immediately stopped and suspended for 16 minutes. The man, whose identity has not been released, was conscious and could move all extremities. He was stabilized and taken to John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth.

In a press conference following the game, team president &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANolan%20Ryan"&gt;Nolan Ryan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; told reporters that "He's over at the emergency room having tests done. The preliminary indications are that it could have been a lot worse. We really don't know at this point in time. I think that obviously he'll remain in the hospital for observation. We're hopeful that what injuries he has are minimal."

Four other spectators, including a young boy, were treated for minor injuries at the scene.

&lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; 1–0 in the semifinals to advance Spain to its first World Cup Finals in its history. Played in Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban, &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;, the game was a re-do of the 2008 European Championship final, in which Spain also won 1–0. About 60,960 people, including Spain's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AQueen%20Sof%C3%ADa%20of%20Spain"&gt;Queen Sofía&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , were in attendance.

The game got off to an interesting start after an Italian fan invaded the pitch in the fourth minute, briefly interrupting the game. A first half dominated both by the German defense and the increasingly powerful offense kept both teams scoreless at halftime. Spain used the second half to threaten the German goal. In the 57th minute, Spain's David Villa came within inches of scoring on an &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAndr%C3%A9s%20Iniesta"&gt;Andrés Iniesta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; cross, and Sergio Ramos was equally close to convert Xabi Alonso's pass. Carles Puyol scored the lone goal in the 73rd minute by heading in Xavi's corner kick. As the game came to an end, the German team was visibly distraught, while fans of the Spanish team partied until late at night, waving flags and singing "Ole! Ole! Ole!".

Villa later said, "This is one of the greatest moments for Spain, for us to be in the final of the World Cup, it's history. And we want to make more history in the final."

In addition to being Spain's first finals appearance, the &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;' defeat of &lt;a href="Uruguay"&gt;Uruguay&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday advanced the Netherlands to the finals as well. As neither team has won the World Cup before, this match-up ensures that either the Netherlands or Spain will come out having won the World Cup for the first time. It will also be the two teams' first ever match against each other in the World Cup. Uruguay and Germany will play each other for third place on Saturday at 18:30 UTC, while the finals will be on Sunday 18:30 UTC.

An earthquake occurred on Wednesday evening in &lt;a href="California"&gt;Southern California&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMoment%20Magnitude%20Scale"&gt;magnitude&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of 5.4. According to the United States Geological Survey, the earthquake occurred at 16:53 local time (23:53 UTC). At least two dozen smaller aftershocks, none greater than a magnitude of 3.6, have struck the same area since the quake.

The earthquake occurred at a depth of 14 kilometers (8.7 miles), and the epicenter was located 20 kilometers Northwest of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABorrego%20Springs"&gt;Borrego Springs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ; 23 kilometers Southeast of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAnza%2C%20California"&gt;Anza&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ; 33 kilometers Northeast of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALake%20Henshaw"&gt;Lake Henshaw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ; and 94 kilometers to the northeast of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Diego%2C%20California"&gt;San Diego&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

There were no initial reports of any major damage. San Diego skyscrapers are reported to have swayed as a result of the earthquake.

Wikinews reporter &lt;a href="Mike%20Morales"&gt;Mike Morales&lt;/a&gt;, who was in the area at the time of the tremor, reported: "I remember it happened around five o'clock. It was nothing much, just a little rolling feeling."

According to Kate Hutton of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%20Institute%20of%20Technology"&gt;California Institute of Technology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , this earthquake was caused by an earlier quake in April with a magnitude of 7.2. Hutton says that "changes in the fault line" from April's quake, caused today's quake to occur. The April quake was centered in the southern Imperial Valley south of Mexicali, &lt;a href="Mexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; near the Colorado River.

&lt;a href="National%20Basketball%20Association"&gt;National Basketball Association&lt;/a&gt; (NBA) free agents &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Bosh"&gt;Chris Bosh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADwyane%20Wade"&gt;Dwyane Wade&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; will sign with the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMiami%20Heat"&gt;Miami Heat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the pair announced yesterday. 

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AESPN"&gt;ESPN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; first reported the decision early yesterday. The players confirmed the deal in the afternoon with a joint appearance on the network. The Miami Heat did not comment per NBA rules which prevented teams from discussing contracts prior to Thursday at 12:01 a.m. (ET), at which point contracts may be signed. 

Bosh, a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Apower%20forward"&gt;power forward&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , comes to the Heat after playing the first seven years of his career with the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AToronto%20Raptors"&gt;Toronto Raptors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . It is still unclear whether Bosh will sign a contract outright with the Heat, or if he will sign with the Raptors then be traded to the Heat. Raptors and Heat officials are attempting to negotiate a sign-and-trade deal which will allow the Raptors to receive players or draft picks for losing Bosh, and will allow Bosh to receive as much as &lt;a href="US%24"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;25 million more in a contract.

Wade, a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Apoint%20guard"&gt;point guard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , returns to the Heat, the team where he has played his entire NBA career. Wade was considering a move to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChicago%20Bulls"&gt;Chicago Bulls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , but in the end decided to stay in Miami. He told ESPN, "It became the best decision for me, especially when Chris said he wanted to come down."

Both men feel that this situation will give them the best opportunity to win NBA titles. Said Bosh, "It's not about the money. It's not about anything else except for winning. I'm a winner. Dwyane's a winner. We're going to bring winning to Miami."

The ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASolar%20Impulse%20project"&gt;Solar Impulse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤, an experimental &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Asolar%20power"&gt;solar-powered&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; airplane, landed in &lt;a href="Switzerland"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday after completing a successful 26-hour test flight. The flight was a proof-of-concept displaying that a solar-powered aircraft can accumulate enough power from the sun during the day to power it through the night. The team that designed and built the aircraft believes that, in theory, the plane could fly indefinitely, given that there is enough sunlight to power it.

The flight is the longest and highest flight by a piloted solar-powered aircraft, with an average altitude of about 28,000 feet, and an average speed of around 25 miles per hour. Pilot Andre Borschberg, a former fighter pilot in the Swiss air force, said "I've been a pilot for forty years now, but this flight has been the most incredible of my flying career. Just sitting there and watching the battery charge level rise and rise thanks to the sun. I have just flown more than 26 hours without using a drop of fuel and without causing any pollution."

The plane can carry only one passenger, and contains 12,000 solar cells. However, the plane does have its setbacks; a blog on the project's website reported after seventeen hours of flight that "Andre's feeling great up there. His only complaints involve little things like a slightly sore back as well as a ten-hour period during which it was minus twenty degrees Celsius in the cockpit. That made his drinking water system freeze up and worst of all his iPod batteries die." 

The project's intention is to show that emissions-free air travel is a feasible concept; however, the team does not believe that current propulsion methods will be replaced by alternatives in the near future.

The Johnsons were not the only family in NASCAR to expect the birth of a child.

The jury has not heard the case for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Apunitive%20damages"&gt;punitive damages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ; however, it awarded the plaintiffs $613 million (about €484 million) in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Astatutory%20damages"&gt;statutory damages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The remaining $58 million (about €46 million) was in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Arestitution"&gt;restitution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

After the verdict was issued, Skilled Healthcare stocks plunged over 75% to a record low.

An official statement from SH says it "strongly disagrees" with the jury's verdict. SH plans on filing an appeal to the decision. The company could possibly face bankruptcy because of this verdict.

One of the lawyers for the nearly 32,000 plaintiffs, Timothy Needham, claimed that inadequate staffing levels put SH's patients at risk. He said, "The company knows that this lack of staffing causes a higher risk of problems for patients. Call lights don't get answered, persons don't get proper hygiene, persons don't get their medications on time or the care they need." 

This lawsuit does not apply to SH's facilities in &lt;a href="Arizona"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Iowa"&gt;Iowa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Kansas"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Missouri"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Nevada"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20Mexico"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;.

NBA small forward &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALeBron%20James"&gt;LeBron James&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; announced today that he will "take his talents to South Beach and join the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMiami%20Heat"&gt;Miami Heat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ," after spending six years as the star player for the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACleveland%20Cavaliers"&gt;Cleveland Cavaliers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Anticipation over LeBron's future team had been simmering for weeks as &lt;a href="National%20Basketball%20Association"&gt;NBA&lt;/a&gt; teams tried to lure the free agent to their rosters. LeBron had met with representatives from the Cavaliers, Heat, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChicago%20Bulls"&gt;Chicago Bulls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Knicks"&gt;New York Knicks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Jersey%20Nets"&gt;New Jersey Nets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20Clippers"&gt;Los Angeles Clippers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

In an interview televised by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AESPN"&gt;ESPN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , James said that the Heat would give him "the best opportunity to win now and to win in the future also." However, James admitted, "I can't say it was always in my plans, because I never thought it was possible," and that he had changed his mind repeatedly in the days leading up to the announcement. He emphasized, "It's not about individuals. It's about a team." James also said in the interview that "the things that the Miami Heat franchise have done, to free up cap space and be able to put themselves in a position this summer to have all three of us, it was hard to turn down. Those are two great players (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADwayne%20Wade"&gt;Dwayne Wade&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Bosh"&gt;Chris Bosh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ), two of the greatest players that we have in this game today."

Referring to his fans in Ohio, James said, "They can have mixed emotions, of course," and that his hometown of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAkron"&gt;Akron&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the state will "always be home for me."

Though Cleveland had offered James more money, to James and new teammates Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh, winning seemed to be more important. Both Wade and Bosh settled for less cash, instead fitting James into Miami's salary cap space.

Wade had announced Wednesday that he would be continuing to play in Miami, while Bosh decided to move to Florida from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AToronto%20Raptors"&gt;Toronto Raptors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The three were drafted in 2003 and were teammates in the 2008 US Olympic basketball team. Wade said that playing with James and Bosh was "going to be crazy," while Bosh &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATwitter"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , "Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" Fans in Miami honked horns outside the Heat's home arena, while television images from Cleveland showed LeBron James's jerseys being burned. Prior to the announcement, amid rumors that James would sign with the Heat, Heat season tickets had sold out.

Football fans in &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; were rejoicing on Friday after an octopus called Paul predicted their team will win the &lt;a href="2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup"&gt;2010 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="Paul%20the%20Octopus"&gt;Paul the Octopus&lt;/a&gt;, who lives in an aquarium in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOberhausen"&gt;Oberhausen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , in western &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, has so far correctly forecast who will win every World Cup game involving the German side. Paul also predicted that the German team will beat &lt;a href="Uruguay"&gt;Uruguay&lt;/a&gt; in Saturday's match for third place.

The octopus has become something of a celebrity during the World Cup, as all six of his predictions for Germany's World Cup games proved accurate. His final prediction, for Sunday's final between Spain and the &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, was broadcast live on television. The eight-legged sea creature was given two boxes to choose from &amp;mdash; one marked with a flag from the Netherlands and another with the flag of Spain. In the end it was the Spanish flag he went for.

Rupert Adams of William Hill, one of Britain's largest bookmakers, said that the octopus's success rate is remarkable.

"If you had had ten pounds on each and every prediction then re-invested your winnings you would currently have over 1,450 pounds," said Adams. "It's an astonishing feat to get six predictions in a row. I am told people are walking into our shops and saying 'I will have what the Octopus predicted.'"

But David Spiegelhalter, Professor of the Public Understanding of Risk at the University of Cambridge, was less convinced of the animal's abilities, pointing out that many other creatures failed to predict the correct outcomes of matches and went unreported.

"It's like seeing footage of a golfer getting a hole-in-one," Spiegelhalter said. "We're not seeing the millions of times the golfer made the shot and it didn't go in."

At least one other animal has weighed in on the World Cup final. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMani%20the%20Parakeet"&gt;Mani&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a 13 year old parakeet from Singapore, allegedly correctly predicted the results of the four quarter-final matches, and also Spain's semi-final victory over Germany. The parakeet apparently thinks that the Netherlands will defeat Spain in the final.

Which of the supposed oracles is correct remains to be seen. The final takes place on Sunday in Johannesburg, &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="Church%20of%20England"&gt;Church of England&lt;/a&gt;'s ruling body, the General Synod, yesterday rejected a compromise deal on the divisive issue of women bishops. An amendment to satisfy traditionalists was jointly proposed by its two most senior clerics, the Archbishop of Canterbury, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARowan%20Williams"&gt;Dr Rowan Williams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and the Archbishop of York, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Sentamu"&gt;Dr John Sentamu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Despite getting a majority of support across the Synod as a whole, it was rejected after narrowly being defeated in the vote of the House of Clergy.

The amendment would have allowed male "complementary bishops" to cater to parishes, which objected to having a female bishop in their diocese. The bishops would supposedly have "co-ordinate" powers, but some campaigners supporting women bishops said the plans would result in an unfair "two-track" system.

"I do not believe this will deliver, and it is certainly not good news for women clergy," said Christine Allsopp, Archdeacon of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANorthampton"&gt;Northampton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , of the proposed amendment.

Many traditionalists have strongly opposed the ordination of female bishops, and threatened to leave the Church over the issue. The situation has been worsened by offers from &lt;a href="Pope%20Benedict%20XVI"&gt;Pope Benedict&lt;/a&gt; for disaffected Anglicans to join the &lt;a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church"&gt;Roman Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt; instead.

Earlier Dr Sentamu had claimed that Dr Williams was facing "spin and propaganda", and called for it to end. Dr Williams insisted that the vote should not be considered a test of the Synod's "loyalty" to the two Archbishops, but the rejection is widely seen as a blow to their authority.

The Synod is due to continue its debate on women bishops over the next few days.

&lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; defeated the &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aextra%20time"&gt;extra time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 1–0 to win this year's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFIFA%20World%20Cup"&gt;FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The winning goal came in the last few minutes of the match, which saw thirteen yellow cards and one red card.

Yesterday's win marked Spain's first World Cup victory, in their first World Cup final appearance, making the Spanish team the eighth distinct team to have won the championship since it began in 1930. It was the second time that the European champion for that year won the World Cup as well, the first being &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Germany"&gt;West Germany&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's victory in 1974. It was also the first time that a European team emerged as the World Cup victors on a continent other than Europe. For the Dutch, it was the third time they have lost in the World Cup finals, having done so in 1974 and 1978.

The final match, played in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohannesburg%2C%20South%20Africa"&gt;Johannesburg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASoccer%20City"&gt;Soccer City&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; stadium, stayed tied at 0–0 for all of regulation time. Called "a very difficult match" by Spanish coach &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVicente%20del%20Bosque"&gt;Vicente del Bosque&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the game started with a slow first half. The Dutch had an opportunity to take the lead in the second half, but &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AArjen%20Robben"&gt;Arjen Robben&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's shots were blocked by Spanish captain &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIker%20Casillas"&gt;Iker Casillas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The Netherlands were forced to play with only ten players near the end of extra time after &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Heitinga"&gt;John Heitinga&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was kicked out of the game.

The winning shot of the match came from Spanish midfielder &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAndres%20Iniesta"&gt;Andres Iniesta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the 116th minute, just four minutes from the end of extra time. He managed to kick the ball past Dutch goalkeeper &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMaarten%20Stekelenburg"&gt;Maarten Stekelenburg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from just 8 metres (26.2 feet) away. If Iniesta had not made the goal, and game stayed scoreless until the end of extra time, the game would have been decided by a penalty shoot-out.

Spain's victory was correctly predicted by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aoracular%20animal"&gt;oracular animal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="Paul%20the%20Octopus"&gt;Paul the Octopus&lt;/a&gt;. Paul's 2010 FIFA World Cup prediction record stayed at 100 per cent as a result.

The Gippsland League is the only major &lt;a href="Australian%20rules%20football"&gt;Australian rules football&lt;/a&gt; competition in the Gippsland region according to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVictorian%20Country%20Football%20League"&gt;Victorian Country Football League&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Scores are quoted as ♡❤goals-behinds (total)♡❤.

Traralgon's defence held strong as the team went inside their attacking fifty 63 times to Sales 57. Sale, however, lead the centre clearances 35 to Traralgon's 27. 

The victory moves Traralgon back to second, a game clear of Morwell, who lost to Maffra by 32 points.

Final scores &amp;mdash; Traralgon, on the road, 19-8 (122) defeated Sale 7-7 (49).

<h1>BP: New cap on Gulf of Mexico oil well in place</h1>

For the first time since April 20, no oil is flowing into the &lt;a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico"&gt;Gulf of Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, though the halt may be temporary, as integrity testing began on a new sealing cap. The cap was installed on a leaking well in an effort by the &lt;a href="BP"&gt;BP&lt;/a&gt; energy company to contain oil spewing into the Gulf of Mexico. The previous containment cap, which was removed Saturday, had a much looser fit than the new one and allowed oil to escape into the Gulf. It took about three days for the cap to be removed, the site prepared, and the new one to be slowly lowered into position.

The energy company had planned to begin running integrity tests Tuesday to measure the performance of the well under pressure. The tests were delayed a day for further analysis, but clearance to proceed was given Wednesday afternoon, then a leak in a choke line had to be repaired. BP senior vice president Kent Wells announced at his Thursday afternoon briefing that the final valve on the cap assembly started to close at 1:15 PM Thursday and was fully closed at 2:25 PM, finally shutting in the oil flow. If the tests show that the well is strong enough, the sealing cap valves will likely remain closed. If the well cannot be safely closed from the top, the new cap is designed to funnel almost all the oil to ships above while two relief wells are constructed for a permanent fix. After the old cap was removed, oil flowed freely into the waters of the Gulf until the present cap was installed at about 7:00 PM CDT Monday (00:00 UTC Tuesday).

BP has stated that this oil containment system has never been deployed at the current depths, nor has it been tested in the conditions that it will be expected to operate in. During the testing period, which could last anywhere from six to forty-eight hours, all undersea oil containment systems will be temporarily suspended. The company made clear that, even if the tests succeed, this does not mean that oil leakage has permanently ceased. 

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADoug%20Suttles"&gt;Doug Suttles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a BP executive, explained that during the test, the well pressure will be carefully monitored. Suttles said at a Monday briefing that the ideal would be for tests to show high pressure around the seal, indicating that no oil is escaping. He also stated that on the other hand, the pressures could be lower than anticipated, leading to the assumption that the well is damaged and is leaking oil and gas into surrounding rock. If this were to happen, keeping the cap shut could further damage the well. The solution for this scenario is to reopen the valves and funnel most, if not all, of the oil to ships above.

Drilling of the first relief well was suspended until completion of the integrity test. Kent Wells explained at his Wednesday morning briefing that the first relief well is now 4 feet from the original well and there is a remote possibility that the pressure test could open a path to the relief well. Drilling of the second relief well has stopped at 16,000 feet so as not to interfere with the first well and to keep routing options open in case the first relief well fails. Even if the pressure tests do succeed and the main well is shut, work on the first relief well will continue until it intercepts the main well. When this occurs, mud and cement will be pumped into the well for a permanent seal. Containment and clean up operations will continue even after the relief wells are finished to deal with oil already released.

The &lt;a href="Deepwater%20Horizon%20oil%20spill"&gt;Deepwater Horizon oil spill&lt;/a&gt; began on April 20 when the &lt;a href="Deepwater%20Horizon"&gt;Deepwater Horizon oil rig&lt;/a&gt; exploded, killing eleven and marking the start of the worst offshore oil spill in &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; history.

<h3>&lt;a href="Bomb%20blasts%20in%20Uganda%20kill%20dozens"&gt;Bomb blasts in Uganda kill dozens&lt;/a&gt; (0:39)</h3>

Two bomb explosions in Kampala, the capital of Uganda, killed at least 64 people earlier today, according to police reports.

Authorities say the explosions took place at an Ethiopian restaurant, where customers were watching the World Cup final.

Inspector General of Police Kale Kayihura commented that "[t]hese bombs were definitely targeting World Cup crowds. [...] This was a terrorist attack. It was a deliberate, calculated attack to inflict maximum damage."

Felix Kulaije, an army spokesperson, suggested that the Somali rebel group al-Shabaab might be behind the attacks, saying that "[w]e suspect it's al-Shabaab because they've been promising this for [a] long [time]."

An unnamed commander for al-Shabaab spoke to the Associated Press earlier today regarding the incident. Although he didn't indicate whether his group was responsible for the attacks or not, he said he was happy the bombings took place, saying: "Uganda is one of our enemies. Whatever makes them cry, makes us happy."

If the group did indeed organize the bombings, then it would be the first time they had conducted attacks outside Somalia.

The bombings in the African nation dampen the relatively peaceful events of the 2010 World Cup on the African continent where 

<h3>&lt;a href="Spain%20defeat%20the%20Netherlands%201-0%20in%20extra%20time%20to%20win%202010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup"&gt;Spain defeat the Netherlands 1-0 in extra time to win 2010 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt; (1:51)</h3>

Spain defeated the Netherlands in extra time 1–0 to win this year's FIFA World Cup championship. The winning goal came in the last few minutes of the match, which saw thirteen yellow cards and one red card.

Yesterday's win marked Spain's first World Cup victory, in their first World Cup final appearance, making the Spanish team the eighth distinct team to have won the championship since it began in 1930. It was the second time that the European champion for that year won the World Cup as well, the first being West Germany's victory in 1974. It was also the first time that a European team emerged as the World Cup victors on a continent other than Europe. For the Dutch, it was the third time they have lost in the World Cup finals, having done so in 1974 and 1978.

The final match, played in Johannesburg's Soccer City stadium, stayed tied at 0–0 for all of regulation time. Called "a very difficult match" by Spanish coach Vicente del Bosque, the game started with a slow first half. The Dutch had an opportunity to take the lead in the second half, but Arjen Robben's shots were blocked by Spanish captain Iker Casillas. The Netherlands were forced to play with only ten players near the end of extra time after John Heitinga was kicked out of the game.

The winning shot of the match came from Spanish midfielder Andres Iniesta in the 116th minute, just four minutes from the end of extra time. He managed to kick the ball past Dutch goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg from just 8 metres (26.2 feet) away. If Iniesta had not made the goal, and game stayed scoreless until the end of extra time, the game would have been decided by a penalty shoot-out.

Spain's victory was correctly predicted by the now famous (or infamous, depending on who you were cheering for) Paul the Octopus. Paul's 2010 FIFA World Cup prediction record stayed at 100 per cent as a result.

<h3>&lt;a href="Rosetta%20spacecraft%20passes%20Lutetia%20asteroid"&gt;Rosetta spacecraft passes Lutetia asteroid&lt;/a&gt; (4:37)</h3>

The unmanned Rosetta spacecraft made its closest approach to the Lutetia asteroid this past Saturday. Rosetta flew within 3,162 kilometers of the asteroid taking high-resolution photos and searched for traces of an atmosphere and magnetic effects. The spacecraft also studied the composition and mass of the asteroid.

Holger Sierks of the Max Planck Institute stated "I think this is a very old object. Tonight we have seen a remnant of the Solar System's creation." Around 400 photographs were taken during the flyby; however, it will take several days for in-depth data to be transferred to Earth.

"Little is known about asteroid Lutetia other than it is about 100 kilometers (62 miles) wide," says American project scientist Claudia Alexander, "Allowing Rosetta's suite of science instruments to focus on this target of opportunity should greatly expand our knowledge of this huge space rock, while at the same time giving the mission's scientific instruments a real out-of-this-world workout."

The Lutetia asteroid is the largest asteroid yet visited by a spacecraft. Throughout its 4.5 billion year lifespan, its surface has been bombarded repeatedly by other space debris. Very little is known about the asteroid and scientists hope that this flyby will help determine the asteroid's origin. They hope to make their findings public at the Europlanet conference in Rome, Italy, late this September.

The Rosetta spacecraft, a project led by the European Space Agency, flew by the asteroid on its way to the Churyumov-Gerasimenko comet. Launched in 2004, the spacecraft is expected to arrive at its final destination in 2014. Once there, it will deploy the Philae lander to explore the comet's surface. The spacecraft's visit to this asteroid marks the final major scientific milestone before it is put into hibernation mode to be reactivated in 2011.

Speaking of rejuvinating from hibernation,

NASCAR Sprint Cup Series driver David Reutimann won his first race of the season after leading fifty-two laps on Saturday during the 2010 LifeLock.com 400 at Chicagoland Speedway in Joliet, Illinois. The victory gained Reutimann two places in the current point standings, moving him closer to point leader Kevin Harvick, but he still lags by 555 points and remains in fifteenth position.

It was his second career victory in the US's leading professional stock car series. His previous victory came during the rain-shortened 2009 Coca-Cola 600. After the race, Reutimann said, "I heard so much stuff for winning a rain-shortened event... everybody said we didn’t earn it... We earned this one. Nobody gave it to us and that feels really good."

Carl Edwards finished in the second position, ahead of Jeff Gordon and Clint Bowyer in third and fourth, respectively. Jamie McMurray, Kasey Kahne, Jeff Burton, Denny Hamlin, Tony Stewart, and Paul Menard rounded out the top ten positions. The race had a total of four cautions and ten lead changes among seven different drivers. Jimmie Johnson led the most laps by leading ninety-three.

In the point standings, Harvick and Gordon remained in the first and second position. Johnson maintained the third position while Hamlin moved to fourth. Kurt Busch, Kyle Busch, Burton, and Matt Kenseth followed in the top eight points positions. Stewart remained in the ninth position, as Edwards gained two positions to be in tenth. Greg Biffle and Clint Bowyer rounded out the top twelve, and are currently in the Chase.

The English potter, credited with the industrialization of the manufacture of pottery, Josiah Wedgwood, was born in 1730.

A prominent abolitionist, Wedgwood is remembered for his "Am I Not A Man And A Brother?" anti-slavery medallion. He was also a member of the Darwin-Wedgwood family as he was the grandfather of Charles Darwin and Emma Darwin.

Born in Burslem, Staffordshire, England, he was the twelfth and last child of Thomas Wedgwood and Mary Wedgwood, both of whom were of English Dissenters, Christians who separated from the Church of England in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries who opposed state interference in religious matters.

Josiah survived a childhood bout of smallpox to serve as an apprentice potter under his eldest brother Thomas Wedgwood IV. Smallpox left him with a permanently weakened knee, which made him unable to work the foot pedal of a potter's wheel. As a result, he concentrated from an early age on designing pottery rather than making it.

In his early twenties, Wedgwood began working with the most renowned English pottery-maker of his day, Thomas Whieldon. He began experimenting with a wide variety of pottery techniques, an experimentation that coincided with the burgeoning of the nearby industrial city of Manchester. Inspired, Wedgwood leased the Ivy Works shop in his home town of Burslem. Over the course of the next decade, his experimentation (and a considerable injection of capital from his marriage to a richly-endowed distant cousin) transformed the sleepy artisan works into the first true pottery factory.

Josiah worked in pottery, and his work was of very high quality. It is rumored that if he saw in his workshop an offending vessel that failed to meet with his standards, he would smash it with his stick, exclaiming, "This will not do for Josiah Wedgwood!" He was also keenly interested in the scientific advances of his day and it was this interest that underpinned his adoption of its approach and methods to revolutionize the quality of his pottery. His unique glazes began to distinguish his wares from anything else on the market.

As a burgeoning industrialist, Wedgwood was a major backer of the Trent and Mersey Canal dug between the River Trent and River Mersey, during which time he became friends with Erasmus Darwin. Later that decade, his burgeoning business caused him to move from the smaller Ivy Works to the newly-built Etruria Works, which would run for 180 years. The factory was so-named after the Etruria district of Italy, where black porcelain dating to Etruscan times was being excavated. Wedgwood found this porcelain inspiring, and his first major commercial success was its duplication with what he called "Black Basalt".

Not long after the new works opened, continuing trouble with his smallpox-afflicted knee made necessary the amputation of his right leg. In 1780, his long-time business partner Thomas Bentley died, and Wedgwood turned to Darwin for help in running the business. As a result of the close association that grew up between the Wedgwood and Darwin families, Josiah's eldest daughter would later marry Erasmus' son. One of the children of that marriage, Charles Darwin, would also marry a Wedgwood — Emma, Josiah's granddaughter. This double-barreled inheritance of Wedgwood's money gave Charles Darwin the leisure time to formulate his theory of evolution.

Josiah was also an active member of the Lunar Society, a dinner club and informal learned society of prominent figures of the day who would meet during the full moon, as the extra light made the journey home easier and safer in the absence of street lighting. The members cheerfully referred to themselves as "lunaticks", a pun on lunatics. He was elected to the Royal Society in 1783 for the development of a pyrometer, a device which can be used to determine the temperature of an object's surface.

Wedgwood was a prominent slavery abolitionist. His friendship with Thomas Clarkson - abolitionist campaigner and the first historian of the British abolition movement - aroused his interest in slavery. Wedgwood mass produced cameos depicting the seal for the Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade and had them widely distributed, which thereby became a popular and celebrated image. The Wedgwood medallion was the most famous image of a black person in all of 18th-century art. The actual design of the cameo was probably done by either William Hackwood or Henry Webber who were modelers in his Stoke-on-Trent factory. From 1787 until his death in 1795, Wedgwood actively participated in the abolition of Slavery cause, and his Slave Medallion, which brought the attention of the public to the horrors of the Slave trade, was very effective in bringing public attention to abolition.

In the latter part of his life, Wedgwood's obsession was to duplicate the Portland Vase, a blue and white glass vase dating to the first century BCE. For three years he worked on the project, eventually producing what he considered a satisfactory copy in 1789.

After passing on his company to his sons, Wedgwood died at home, probably of cancer of the jaw, in 1795. He was buried three days later in the parish church of Stoke-on-Trent. Seven years later a marble memorial tablet commissioned by his sons was installed there.

Wedgwood's company is still a famous name in pottery today (as part of Waterford Wedgwood), and "Wedgwood China" is the commonly used term for his Jasperware, the blue (or sometimes green) china with overlaid white decoration, still common throughout the world.

He is also credited as the inventor of modern marketing, specifically direct mail, money-back guarantees, traveling salesmen, self-service, free delivery, buy one get one free, and illustrated catalogs.

On Friday, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20Police%20Department"&gt;Los Angeles Police Department&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; arrested and charged a woman with murder, after she reportedly stabbed her ten-year-old daughter to death at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Air%20Force"&gt;Air Force&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; base Fort MacArthur residential facility in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Pedro%2C%20California"&gt;San Pedro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;. The girl's father is a former member of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Navy"&gt;Navy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The 49-year-old mother, Bong Sook Chavez, allegedly slit her daughter's wrists and neck. Chavez slit her own wrists after attacking her daughter. In a statement issued on Monday, investigators say Chavez likely stabbed her daughter while she was asleep in bed.

Deputy Chief Pat Gannon told the ♡❤&lt;a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times"&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ Chavez has a history of mental health problems. According to Gannon, "The father was able to get the weapon away from her." The father awoke at around 2:30 a.m. local time to find Chavez attacking her daughter. 

The daughter, Quesi Chavez, later died at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Southern%20California"&gt;University of Southern California&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's Medical Center as a result of her wounds. As of Monday, the mother remained in the hospital in stable condition, but was scheduled to appear in court yesterday.

The Afghanistan Rights Monitor (ARM), an Afghan human-rights group, stated yesterday that 2010 was the worst year in terms of violence for the country since US-led troops occupied the country in 2001.

The ARM says that civilian deaths have risen and that Taliban insurgents have not been defeated despite a surge in troops in Afghanistan. According to their statement, "In terms of insecurity, 2010 has been the worst year since the demise of the Taliban regime in late 2001. Not only have the number of security incidents increased, the space and depth of the insurgency and counter-insurgency-related violence have maximized dramatically."

ARM's figures state that over 1,074 civilians were killed and over 1,500 wounded in war violence in the first half of this year, a slight increase over 1,059 deaths in the same time period in 2009. "Up to 1,200 security incidents were recorded in June, the highest number of incidents compared to any month since 2002," the ARM commented.

Over half of civilian deaths in the first six months of this year were caused by Taliban insurgents that showed "little or no respect for the safety and protection of non-combatants in their armed rebellion against the government and its foreign supporters." The group also said that the second highest cause of civilian deaths were suicide attacks by the Taliban which have killed 127 people. 

Also, the ARM reported that a reduction of US and NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) air strikes reduced their share of civilians killed. The air strike reduction had been ordered by the former commander of foreign forces, General Stanley McChrystal, who was fired by US president Barack Obama for making rude comments about top White House government officials.

In December of last year, US president Obama sent an additional 30,000 soldiers into the country in an effort to halt the Taliban's influence in the region. However, the ARM says in its mid-year report, titled "Civilian Casualties of Conflict", that the move failed to have any lasting effect, and that "the insurgency has become more resilient, multi-structured and deadly".

According to the ARM, most of the injuries and deaths were attributed to homemade bombs — otherwise known as improvised explosive devices. These bombs are considered the Taliban's main weapon.

140,000 soldiers from both the US and NATO are stationed in Afghanistan; another 10,000 are scheduled to enter the landlocked Asian country in the next few weeks. Over 350 US and NATO troops have been killed so far this year, compared with 520 last year. Over 30 troops have been killed in the first 12 days of July.

<h3>&lt;a href="Six%20H1N1%20cases%20appear%20in%20the%20Philippines"&gt;Six H1N1 cases appear in the Philippines&lt;/a&gt; (3:25)</h3>

Six students in Ilocos Sur, Philippines tested positive for the H1N1 influenza virus. This occurrence is part of a rise in A(H1N1) and malaria during recent weeks in two provinces, as was the confirmation of twenty cases of malaria in Zambales.

Officials from the Department of Health say that they are not surprised, as A(H1N1) cases began to appear at about the same time last year, coinciding with the onset of the local flu season. Other health officials believe that the rise is due to the onset of the rainy season. The department noted that all prior cases in the Philippines have been "mild" and patients fully recovered. In the current case, five of those affected have recovered, while one still shows slight symptoms.

"If we look at the pattern for this month, it was also the same time last year when cases of A(H1N1) started increasing," says Dr. Lyndon Lee Suy. The Department of Health believes that the appearance of the virus should not cause distress; however, Suy warns that a new strain could appear.

The Philippines reported their first case of A(H1N1) in May 2009 in a ten-year-old child from the United States. According to the World Health Organization, 214 countries and territories have confirmed cases of A(H1N1), with a total of more than 18,311 deaths. As of June 2009, around 129 cases have been reported in the Philippines.

<h3>&lt;a href="Australia%27s%20Governor-General%20cuts%20trip%20short%20over%20looming%20election"&gt;Australia's Governor-General cuts trip short over looming election&lt;/a&gt; (5:41)</h3>

Australia's Governor-General, Quentin Bryce, has cut Singapore and the UK from her official winter trip, keeping only France on her schedule, due to expectations that Prime Minister Julia Gillard will arrive at Government House in the coming days to request the Governor-General to call an election.

A spokesperson for the Governor-General said that "She wanted to be out of the country for as little time as possible [...] She was supposed to go Singapore and UK and now she's just going to France".

There has been much speculation as to when Gillard was to request that the election be called by the Governor-General, with 21st and 28th of August being most likely. This would be the first time since 1987 that an election was held during the winter.

As a result, Ms Bryce will head to Fromelles in France to represent Australia in a dedication ceremony and then return home, bringing her ten day trip down to five days.

In a speech today in Adelaide, South Australia Gillard suggested that she wanted to achieve a mandate by the people through the usual means of the Governor-General.

"I will ask the Australian people for their trust to move forward," Gillard said in the same speech.

According to current Nielsen and Galaxy polls, on a two-party preferred basis, Julia Gillard leads her rival, opposition leader Tony Abbott, 52-48 percent.

<h3>&lt;a href="Switzerland%20sets%20Polish%20film%20director%20Roman%20Polanski%20free"&gt;Switzerland sets Polish film director Roman Polanski free&lt;/a&gt; (6:59)</h3>

On Monday, Swiss authorities refused a request from the U.S. to extradite Polish film director Roman Polanski on charges stemming from the 1977 accusation that he had sex with an American thirteen-year-old girl, Samantha Geimer, in Los Angeles, California. Though the film director had pleaded guilty to rape and unlawful sexual intercourse, he fled to France before he could be sentenced.

U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said that "[t]he rape of a 13-year-old girl by an adult who should know better, and that does know better, is a crime. We will continue to seek justice in this case, and we will evaluate our options."

However, Switzerland has said no appeal to its decision was possible. Polanski was arrested last September by Swiss police when he arrived in Zurich to receive a lifetime career award at a film festival. The Swiss were acting on a request from the U.S. government.

The Swiss Justice Ministry based its decision on the fact that it was unable to determine whether Polanski had already served the full sentence for his crime. This was due to the Los Angeles Superior Court in May ruling that the records of the closed-door 1977 hearings had to remain secret.

In past hearings, Polanski's lawyers argued that there were irregularities in the original handling of the case, and U.S. judge Peter Espinoza agreed there was misconduct by the original judge.

In the Eighty Years' War the city of Haarlem in the Netherlands was put under a bloody siege by a Spanish army that wanted to reclaim the rebellious city for Philip II, the Spanish King.

The city of Haarlem had a moderate view in the religious war that was going on in the Netherlands at that time. The city managed to escape from the Reformed iconoclasm in 1566 that affected other cities in the Netherlands. When the city of Brielle was conquered by the Geuzen revolutionary army on April 1, the Haarlem municipality did not immediately start supporting the Geuzen. Initially, most city administrators -- unlike many citizens -- did not favor open revolution against Philip II of Spain, who had inherited rule of the Netherlands from his father, the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. However, after much political debate the city officially turned against Philip II on July 4, 1572.

The ruler of Spain was not pleased, and sent an army up north under command of Don Fadrique (Don Frederick in Dutch), son of the Duke of Alva. On November 17, 1572 all citizens of the city of Zutphen were murdered by the Spanish army, and on December 1 the city of Naarden suffered the same fate.

On December 11, 1572 the Spanish army put Haarlem under siege. The city was not very strong, militarily speaking. Although the city was completely surrounded by city walls, they were not in a very good shape. The area around the city could not be inundated, and offered the enemy a lot of places the set up a camp. However, the existence of the Haarlemmermeer (a great lake) nearby, made it difficult for the enemy to cut off the transportation of food into the city completely.

In the Middle Ages it was not usual to fight in the winter, but the city of Haarlem was crucial and Don Fadrique stayed and put the town under siege. The first two months of the siege the situation was in balance. The Spanish army was digging tunnels, to reach the city walls and blow them up. The defenders made tunnels to blow up the Spanish tunnels. The situation became worse for Haarlem on March 29, 1573. The Amsterdam army, faithful to the Spanish king, occupied the Haarlemmermeer and effectively blocked Haarlem from the outside world. The hunger in the city grew, and the situation became so tense that on May 27 many (Spanish-loyal) prisoners were taken from the prison and murdered. 

After seven months the city surrendered on July 13, 1573. Usually, after such a siege, there would be a period of time that the soldiers of the victorious army could pillage the city, but the citizens were allowed to buy themselves and the city free for 240,000 guilders.

The written assurances that had been given to the city were respected, but the whole garrison (which included many English, French Hugenots and Germans) was executed with the exception of the Germans. 40 burghers considered guilty of sedition were executed as well; the besiegers having run out of ammunition, many of them were drowned in the Spaarne river.

Although ultimately the city could not be kept for the Prince of Orange, the siege showed other cities that the Spanish army was not invincible. This idea, and the great losses suffered by the Spanish army, helped the cities of Leiden and Alkmaar in their sieges. The latter city would later defeat the Spanish army, a major breakthrough in the Dutch Revolt. In the Sint-Bavo church the following words can still be read:

In this great need, in our uttermost misery,
we gave up the city, forced by hunger,
not that he took her by storm.

The prisoners were held in at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACamp%20Cropper"&gt;Camp Cropper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the US's detention facility in Iraq. Control of Camp Cropper is scheduled to be transferred to the Iraqi government in a ceremony on Thursday.

Aziz, 74, was sentenced to fifteen years of incarceration by the Iraqi judicial system for the 1992 executions of 42 merchants who profiteered.

According to Deputy Justice Minister Busho Ibrahim, 29 additional prisoners were handed over ten months ago. Ibrahim said, "As of today, we have received 55 former regime officials, the main one is Tariq Aziz, and the others are the oil and culture ministers."

Aziz's defense attorney Badee Izzat Aref told the ♡❤&lt;a href="Associated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that Aziz feared the Iraqi government would execute him. Aref said Aziz told him that "[t]he Iraqi government will certainly kill me. I fear for my life. I expect I won't live except for days. I'm afraid they'll poison my food or won't give me my medicine to silence me. &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;President Obama&lt;/a&gt; is no different from &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush&lt;/a&gt;, who has Iraqi blood on his hands."

Ibrahim asked the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Military"&gt;US Military&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to maintain custody of about 200 detainees for security reasons, including &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASultan%20Hashim%20al-Taie"&gt;Sultan Hashim al-Taie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The Iraqi government will take custody of the remaining 1,800 prisoners held at Camp Cropper.

An &lt;a href="animal%20rights"&gt;animal rights&lt;/a&gt; protestor who left home-made petrol bombs at buildings of the &lt;a href="University%20of%20Oxford"&gt;University of Oxford&lt;/a&gt; has been jailed for ten years. Mel Broughton, a prominent member of the campaign group &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASPEAK%20campaign"&gt;SPEAK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , had denied the charges of conspiracy to commit arson and possession of an article with intent to destroy property, but the jury at Oxford Crown Court found him guilty by unanimous verdict after deliberating for over five hours.

Broughton made his devices using water bottles and sparklers. He put one on the roof of a cricket pavilion belonging to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Queen%27s%20College%2C%20Oxford"&gt;The Queen's College&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in November 2006, and two under a portable cabin at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATempleton%20College%2C%20Oxford"&gt;Templeton College&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in February 2007. The device at the cricket pavilion, which contained twelve litres of petrol, went off and caused about £14,000 of damage. The Templeton College petrol bombs, together containing nine litres of petrol, did not ignite, and DNA on one of them linked Broughton to the attacks. He was protesting about the university's decision to back the construction of an animal research laboratory, and a police search of his home found more sparklers, as well as documents about the university and its staff.
This was the second time that Broughton had been convicted of the offences: his conviction in February 2009 was overturned by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACourt%20of%20Appeal%20of%20England%20and%20Wales"&gt;Court of Appeal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and a re-trial was ordered. This began on June 16, and ended on Tuesday with Broughton's conviction. Judge Patrick Eccles QC imposed a ten-year prison sentence, which will be reduced by two and a half years for the time that Broughton has already served in custody. When sentencing Broughton after the first trial, Judge Eccles said that these events "were part of a ruthless conspiracy to instil fear in all those connected to the laboratory." 

An officer from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThames%20Valley%20Police"&gt;Thames Valley Police&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Detective Superintendent Mark Jones, said that Broughton "was someone who believes direct action, in the form of planting explosives and setting fires, is acceptable", adding that the conviction was the "right result". A university spokesperson said that it "accepted the rights of protestors to voice their objections within the law", but would work "to protect staff and students from criminal activity of any kind."

Another large aftershock of the [[2010 Chile earthquake|February 27 8.8 earthquake]] &amp;mdash; of 6.5 magnitude &amp;mdash; rocked [[Chile]] earlier on Wednesday, the [[USGS]] reported. [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:University of Chile|University of Chile]]&lt;/span&gt; Seismologic Service measured the aftershock's magnitude as 6.6.

The aftershock occurred at 08:32:22 UTC (04:32:22 AM local time), at a depth of 28.4 kilometers (17.6 miles). Its epicenter was located 55 kilometers at the southwest of [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:Lebu|Lebu]]&lt;/span&gt; , [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:Bío Bío Region|Bío Bío Region]]&lt;/span&gt; ; 100 kilometers at the northwest of [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:Temuco|Temuco]]&lt;/span&gt; , [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:Araucanía Region|Araucanía Region]]&lt;/span&gt; ; 100 kilometers at the southwest of [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:Los Ángeles, Chile|Los Ángeles]]&lt;/span&gt; , Bío Bío; and 560 kilometers at the southwest of [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], [[Santiago Metropolitan Region|Metropolitan Region]].

Wikinews reporter [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;Diego Grez&lt;/span&gt; reports the aftershock was clearly felt in [[Pichilemu]]. The aftershock lasted in about ten seconds. Sergio Barrientos, Director of University of Chile Seismologic Service said that it is a "late aftershock" of the February earthquake. "This seism is of the same type as February 27th, but much lighter," he said.

Another aftershock, magnitude 5.1, took place at 20:36:08 local time (Thursday 00:36:08 UTC). It occurred at a depth of 44.3 kilometers (27.5 miles), and the epicenter was located 45 kilometers southwest of [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:San Antonio, Chile|San Antonio]]&lt;/span&gt; , [[Valparaíso Region|Valparaíso]]; 100 kilometers at the southwest of [[Valparaíso]]; 110 kilometers at the northwest of [[Rancagua]], [[O'Higgins Region]]; and 125 kilometers at the southwest of Santiago.

Today is Wednesday, July 14th, 2010. I'm Dan Harlow and this is Wikinews.
<h2>Script</h2>
<h3>(0:44)</h3>

A new sealing cap has been installed on a leaking well in an effort by the BP energy company to contain oil spewing into the Gulf of Mexico. The previous containment cap, which was removed Saturday, had a much looser fit than the new one and allowed oil to escape into the Gulf. It took about three days for the cap to be removed, the site prepared, and the new one to be slowly lowered into position.

The energy company had planned to begin running integrity tests Tuesday to measure the performance of the well under pressure, although these tests have been delayed for further analysis. If the tests show that the well is strong enough, the sealing cap will be closed, shutting in the oil flow. If the well cannot be safely closed from the top, the new cap is designed to funnel almost all the oil to ships above while two relief wells are constructed for a permanent fix. After the old cap was removed, oil flowed freely into the waters of the Gulf until the present cap was installed at about 7:00 PM local time on Monday.

BP has stated that this oil containment system has never been deployed at the current depths, nor has it been tested in the conditions that it will be expected to operate in. During the testing period, which could last anywhere from six to forty-eight hours, all undersea oil containment systems will be temporarily suspended. During this time, BP hopes that no oil will be released into the Gulf from the leaking well; however, this cannot be assured. The company made clear that, even if the tests succeed, this does not mean that oil leakage has permanently ceased.

Doug Suttles, a BP executive, explained that during the test, the valves on the new cap will be slowly shut and the well pressure monitored. Once the valves are closed oil should cease to leak, for the first time since the spill began earlier this year. Suttles said at a Monday briefing that the ideal would be for tests to show high pressure around the seal, indicating that no oil is escaping. He also stated that on the other hand, the pressures could be lower than anticipated, leading to the assumption that the well is damaged and is leaking oil and gas into surrounding rock. If this were to happen, keeping the cap shut would continue to damage the well further. The solution for this scenario is to reopen the valves and funnel most, if not all, of the oil to ships above.

Drilling of the first relief well was suspended until completion of the pressure test. BP senior vice president Kent Wells explained at his Wednesday morning briefing that the first relief well is now 4 feet from the original well and there is a remote possibility that the pressure test could open a path to the relief well. Drilling of the second relief well has stopped at 16,000 feet so as not to interfere with the first well and to keep routing options open in case the first relief well fails. Even if the pressure tests do succeed and the main well is shut, work on the first relief well will continue until it intercepts the main well. When this occurs, mud and cement will be pumped into the well for a permanent seal. Containment operations will continue even if the relief wells are finished to deal with oil already released.

The cap installation is one of the steps of a procedure that could take several more days with the goal of ending the Deepwater Horizon oil spill that began on April 20 when the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded, killing eleven and marking the beginning of the worst offshore oil spill in United States history.

<h3>&lt;a href="US%20hands%20Iraq%20high-profile%20prisoners"&gt;US hands Iraq high-profile prisoners&lt;/a&gt; (4:13)</h3>

The United States today handed over 26 Iraqi prisoners, including Tariq Aziz, Saddam Hussein's former deputy prime minister to the Iraqi government.

The prisoners were held at Camp Cropper, the US's detention facility in Iraq. Control of Camp Cropper is scheduled to be transferred to the Iraqi government in a ceremony on Thursday.

Aziz, 74, was sentenced to fifteen years of incarceration by the Iraqi judicial system for the 1992 executions of 42 merchants who profiteered.

According to Deputy Justice Minister Busho Ibrahim, 29 additional prisoners were handed over ten months ago. Ibrahim said, "As of today, we have received 55 former regime officials, the main one is Tariq Aziz, and the others are the oil and culture ministers."

Aziz's defense attorney Badee Izzat Aref told the Associated Press that Aziz feared the Iraqi government would execute him. Aref said Aziz told him that "[t]he Iraqi government will certainly kill me. I fear for my life. I expect I won't live except for days. I'm afraid they'll poison my food or won't give me my medicine to silence me. President Obama is no different from Bush, who has Iraqi blood on his hands."

Ibrahim asked the US Military to maintain custody of about 200 detainees for security reasons, including Sultan Hashim al-Taie. The Iraqi government will take custody of the remaining 1,800 prisoners held at Camp Cropper.

<h3>&lt;a href="Crash%20data%20suggests%20driver%20error%20in%20Toyota%20accidents"&gt;Crash data suggests driver error in Toyota accidents&lt;/a&gt; (6:34)</h3>

According to The Wall Street Journal, the U.S. Department of Transportation has analyzed data from the vehicles involved in accidents caused by sudden acceleration, which led to Toyota, the world's top automaker, recalling a large number of automobiles. Early analysis showed that the throttle was wide open and the brakes weren't engaged when the cars crashed, and suggests that the accidents may have been caused by drivers unintentionally flooring the accelerator instead of the brakes. The U.S. Department of Transportation did not confirm this report.

However, Toyota is still under federal investigation for a number of known issues with its cars' acceleration. The accelerator is known to not return to idle after it has been released, and the floor mats are known to trap the accelerator pedal. Toyota is also suspected of having electronic glitches in its computer-controlled throttle systems, but released a statement on Wednesday saying that its investigations found no problems in the throttle systems.

Over the years Toyota has received more than 3000 complaints about sudden acceleration. These may have caused up to 75 fatal crashes that led to 93 deaths. Due to these accidents, Toyota provided the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) with ten event data recorders from cars involved in accidents. However, the NHTSA has only managed to confirm that one of these accidents was caused by malfunctions in the car – an accident in California this August that was caused by the floor mat trapping the gas pedal in a depressed position.

The NHTSA, in conjunction with NASA, has begun a broader study into what caused these accidents, however conclusions aren't expected for months. The ongoing lawsuits against Toyota could result in more than $10 billion of damages.

On Friday, the Los Angeles Police Department arrested and charged a woman with murder, after she reportedly stabbed her ten-year-old daughter to death at the Air Force base Fort MacArthur residential facility in San Pedro, California. The girl's father is a former member of the Navy.

The 49-year-old mother, Bong Sook Chavez, allegedly slit her daughter's wrists and neck. Chavez slit her own wrists after attacking her daughter. In a statement issued on Monday, investigators say Chavez likely stabbed her daughter while she was asleep in bed.

Deputy Chief Pat Gannon told the Los Angeles Times that Chavez has a history of mental health problems. According to Gannon, "The father was able to get the weapon away from her." after the father awoke at around 2:30 a.m. local time to find Chavez attacking her daughter.

The daughter, Quesi Chavez, later died at the University of Southern California's Medical Center as a result of her wounds. As of Monday, the mother remained in the hospital in stable condition, but was scheduled to appear in court yesterday.

In her first election promise, Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard specifically offered parents tax breaks of up to A$800 to cover the school uniforms of their children.

Gillard aims to pledge $220 million over four years to expand the current tax breaks to cover refunds each worth $390 for primary school uniforms and $779 for high school uniforms, as well as refunds for other school equipment like texts books and computers. Gillard stated "We all know that uniforms can be an expensive part of sending kids to school, but this change, along with the existing refund for textbooks and computers, will help families with that cost."

This comes amongst heavy speculation that a federal election is to be called in the coming days. Education Minister Simon Crean stated that the new proposal is an “important recognition of the cost of school uniforms and it builds on something that we have established in Government but intend extending if we're [re-]elected ...”

As it stands, 1.7 million Australian children are assisted by the current tax breaks; this proposal could extend coverage to an additional million children, however the tax breaks will not be available until after the lodging of the 2012–13 tax returns.

<h3>&lt;a href="Intel%20posts%20best%20ever%20quarterly%20results"&gt;Intel posts best ever quarterly results&lt;/a&gt; (11:24)</h3>

Technology giant Intel released its second quarter results Tuesday, which were the best in the 42 years of the company's existence. The stronger than anticipated results boosted the company's share price, along with those of other technology firms.

Intel's revenues over the quarter up through June 26th were $10.8 billion, with net profits at $2.9 billion. In the same quarter last year, the company sustained a loss of $398 million. Its gross margin rose to 67%, higher than the forecast of 64.1%. The results were better than forecast by either Intel or outside analysts.

The company, which makes processors for around 80 percent of the world's personal computers, is thought to have benefited from an increase in demand for electronics as the world economy moves out of recession. 

Intel shares rose by 8% following the results. Shares at rival processor manufacturer AMD also rose by 5.5%, with other technology firms seeing similar gains. The Dow Jones Industrial index closed the day at 10,363, an increase of nearly 147 points.

<h3>&lt;a href="Man%20claims%2084%20percent%20ownership%20of%20Facebook"&gt;Man claims 84 percent ownership of Facebook&lt;/a&gt; (12:35)</h3>

Last month, Paul D. Ceglia filed suit against Facebook, the world's largest social network, claiming that he rightfully owns 84 percent of the company. The lawsuit, filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, bases its claims on a 2003 contract between Ceglia and Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The contract reportedly states that Zuckerberg would give Ceglia 50 percent ownership in the company in exchange for designing a website "similar to a live functioning yearbook with the working title of 'The Face Book'," and paying a $1000 fee. Ceglia would also get an extra percentage point every day after January 1, 2004 until the work was completed.

Earlier this month, Judge Thomas Brown issued a temporary restraining order that prevents transfer of Facebook's assets in light of the ongoing lawsuit. According to Victor P. Goldberg, who teaches at Columbia University's Law School, the lawsuit may get tripped up by the statute of limitations, which is six years in New York. PC World says that one problem with Ceglia's claim is that the contract was purportedly signed in 2003, while Zuckerberg didn't register the domain name thefacebook.com until January 2004.

A Facebook spokesman has stated that they believe this current suit is completely frivolous and will fight it vigorously.

This is not the first time Ceglia has appeared in court. In 2009, New York's Attorney General Andrew Cuomo accused Ceglia of fraud. The state claims that Ceglia took more than $200,000 from customers of a wood-pellet fuel company, and failed to deliver any products or refunds; that case is still ongoing. 

<h3>&lt;a href="Drunken%20man%20is%20surprised%20crocodile%20bit%20him"&gt;Drunken man is surprised crocodile bit him&lt;/a&gt; (14:19)</h3>

A 36 year-old man is recovering from surgery after his leg was seriously injured as a result of a bite from a five metre long crocodile named 'Fatso.' Michal Newman, who was intoxicated, climbed into its pen, claiming he wanted to play with it. Newman is now in Broome Hospital, Western Australia after his skirmish with the crocodile which occurred on Monday night at the Broome Crocodile Park. 

In an interview on ABC Radio, Newman explained the events this way : "I thought to myself, 'Well, I will jump the fence and go from behind its tail and pat it and sit on its back, ... and within like one split second before I even slightly touched its back, it already had me by my leg ...".

Experts suggest that as it is winter, the crocodile would be generally inactive at night. In warmer conditions the outcome could have been much worse.

After being grabbed by the crocodile, Newman clung to the fence and yelled at it until it let go, allowing him to scramble over the fence. Newman, nicknamed 'Crocodile Dumb-dee' by the Western Australian media, was earlier removed from a Broome tavern for drunk and disorderly conduct. After the attack however, the AAP news agency says he was allowed back in for one more drink before being taken to the hospital.

Newman says he'll never go near another crocodile again but there's no word on if he'll go near another drink, however.

</ul>
In 2003, The United States Government admitted to the existence of "Area 51", a military base located in the southern portion of Nevada in the western United States, 83 miles north-northwest of downtown Las Vegas. Situated at its center, on the southern shore of Groom Lake, is a large secretive military airfield whose primary purpose is to support development and testing of experimental aircraft and weapons systems.

The intense secrecy surrounding the base, the very existence of which the U.S. government still barely acknowledges, has made it the frequent subject of conspiracy theories and a central component to unidentified flying object (UFO) folklore.

The base is home to the testing of many famous aircraft, especially those designed by the famed Skunk Works, an alias for Lockheed Martin’s Advanced Development Programs which was responsible for the development of the U2 spy plane, the SR-71 Blackbird, the F-117 NightHawk and the F-22 Raptor. A distinguishing characteristic of all these aircraft is their low radar visibility, called stealth technology, which was tested at the Area 51 site.

Soviet spy satellites obtained photographs of the Groom Lake area during the height of the Cold War, and later civilian satellites produced detailed images of the base and its surroundings. These images support only modest conclusions about the base, depicting a nondescript base, long airstrip, hangars and the lake. The base has seven runways including one that now appears to be closed. The closed runway, 14R/32L, is also by far the longest with a total length of approximately 23,300 feet (7,100 m), not including stop-way. 

In December 2007, airline pilots noticed that the base had appeared in their aircraft navigation systems' latest Jeppesen database revision with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) airport identifier code of KXTA and listed as "Homey Airport". The probably inadvertent release of the airport data led to advice by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) that student pilots should be explicitly warned about KXTA and not to consider it as a way-point or destination for any flight even though it now appears in public navigation databases.

Unlike much of the adjoining Nellis Air Force Base range, the area surrounding the lake is permanently off-limits both to civilian and normal military air traffic. Radar stations protect the area, and unauthorized personnel are quickly expelled. Even military pilots risk disciplinary action if they stray into the exclusionary "box" surrounding Groom's airspace.

The base does not appear on public U.S. government maps; the USGS topographic map for the area only shows the long-disused Groom Mine. A civil aviation chart published by the Nevada Department of Transportation shows a large restricted area, but defines it as part of the Nellis restricted airspace. Although officially declassified, the original film taken by U.S. Corona spy satellite in the 1960s has been altered prior to declassification; in answer to freedom of information queries, the government responds that these exposures appear to have been destroyed. 

The base's secretive nature and undoubted connection to classified aircraft research, together with reports of unusual phenomena, have led Area 51 to become a focus of modern UFO and conspiracy theories. Some of the activities mentioned in such theories at Area 51 include the storage, examination, and reverse engineering of crashed alien spacecraft (including material supposedly recovered at Roswell), the study of their occupants (living and dead), and the manufacture of aircraft based on alien technology. Other conspiracy theories state Area 51 has technology leading to the development of a means of weather control, time travel and teleportation technology. 

Many of the conspiracy hypotheses concern underground facilities at Groom or at Papoose Lake, which is located 8.5 miles south, and include claims of a transcontinental underground railroad system, a disappearing airstrip (nicknamed the "Cheshire Airstrip", after Lewis Carroll's Cheshire cat) which briefly appears when water is sprayed onto its camouflaged asphalt, and engineering based on alien technology. Publicly available satellite imagery, however, reveals clearly visible landing strips at Groom Dry Lake, but not at Papoose Lake.

Several people have claimed knowledge of events supporting Area 51 conspiracy theories. These have included Bob Lazar, who claimed in 1989 that he had worked at Area 51's S-4 (a facility at Papoose Lake), where he was contracted to work with alien spacecraft that the U.S. government had in its possession. 

Similarly, the 1996 documentary Dreamland directed by Bruce Burgess included an interview with a 71 year old mechanical engineer who claimed to be a former employee at Area 51 during the 1950s. His claims included that he had worked on a "flying disc simulator" which had been based on a disc originating from a crashed extraterrestrial craft and was used to train US Pilots. He also claimed to have worked with an extraterrestrial being named "J-Rod" and described as a "telepathic translator". 

In 2004, Dan Burisch (pseudonym of Dan Crain) claimed to have worked on cloning alien viruses at Area 51, also alongside the alien named "J-Rod". Burisch's scholarly credentials are the subject of much debate, as he was apparently working as a Las Vegas parole officer in 1989 while also earning a PhD at the State University of New York.

Novels, films, television programs, and other fictional portrayals of Area 51 describe it—or a fictional counterpart—as a haven for extraterrestrials, time travel, and sinister conspiracies, often linking it with the Roswell UFO incident. During the 1996 action film Independence Day, the United States military uses alien technology captured at Roswell to attack the invading alien fleet from Area 51. The "Hangar 51" government warehouse of the Indiana Jones films stores, among other exotic items, the Ark of the Covenant and an alien corpse from Roswell. 

The famous science fiction television "The X-Files" made numerous references to Area 51 during its nine seasons, including an episode where the main character of Fox Mulder switches bodies with that of a man in black type figure (with humorous marriage difficulties) who is an operative working on the base. 

As outlandish as many of the conspiracy theories are, according to political scientist Michael Barkun, conspiracy theories once limited to fringe audiences have become commonplace in mass media. He argues that this has contributed to conspiracism emerging as a cultural phenomenon in the United States of the late 20th and early 21st centuries, and the possible replacement of democracy by conspiracy as the dominant paradigm of political action in the public mind. 

According to anthropologists Todd Sanders and Harry G. West, "evidence suggests that a broad cross section of Americans today…gives credence to at least some conspiracy theories." Belief in conspiracy theories has therefore become a topic of interest for sociologists, psychologists and experts in folklore.

Singer &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARobbie%20Williams"&gt;Robbie Williams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has rejoined and recorded a new album with &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; musical group &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATake%20That"&gt;Take That&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , having departed from the group in 1995. The four other members of Take That are &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGary%20Barlow"&gt;Gary Barlow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHoward%20Donald"&gt;Howard Donald&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJason%20Orange"&gt;Jason Orange&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Owen"&gt;Mark Owen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Robbie Williams decided to leave Take That in 1995 to begin a solo music career; the group subsequently disbanded in 1996. In 2005, Take That was reformed as a four-piece band. Williams announced his return to Take That in November 2009.

The last album the group released before the disbanding was entitled "&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANobody%20Else"&gt;Nobody Else&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ", which was released in 1995. A single entitled "Shame", sung by Robbie Williams and Gary Barlow, is expected to be released on October 4, 2010. The new album from Take That, which has now been recorded, is anticipated to be available from November 2010. All five members of Take That have composed songs for the album, which has currently not yet been given a title and will be issued by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APolydor%20Records"&gt;Polydor Records&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Take That member Mark Owen stated: "Getting the five of us to be in a room together, although always a dream, never actually seemed like becoming a reality. Now the reality of the five of us making a record together feels like a dream. It's been an absolute delight spending time with Rob again. But I'm still a better footballer." Jason Orange commented that he is "over the moon that Robbie's back with us, however long it lasts. I just want to enjoy our time with him. Life is beautifully strange sometimes." Robbie Williams stated that he gets "embarrassingly excited when the five of us are in a room."
