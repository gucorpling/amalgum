&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAthens%2C%20Greece"&gt;Athens, Greece&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEcumenical%20Hellenism"&gt;Ecumenical Hellenism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; program is going to get into its second decade of operation which officially started on March 22, when the heads of the program, Stavros Panousopoulos and professor &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAthanasios%20Angelopoulos"&gt;Athanasios Angelopoulos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; payed a visit to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20Hellenic%20Republic"&gt;President of the Hellenic Republic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , at the Presidential Palace in Athens. President &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKarolos%20Papoulias"&gt;Karolos Papoulias&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; offered his personal official patronage and support to Ecumenical Hellenism and he showed an especial interest for the upcoming edition of the program "Greek treasures in the world". The previous Greek President, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACostis%20Stephanopoulos"&gt;Costis Stephanopoulos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; had also offered his official support to the program's initiatives. 

Ecumenical Hellenism program announced that the second decade of the program's operation (2007-2016) will start with a concert with the famous Greek singer &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Dalaras"&gt;George Dalaras&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAthens%20Concert%20Hall"&gt;Athens Concert Hall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in mid-June as well as with the scheduled trip of the program to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , during July 2007. According to the program's officials, in August 2008, the second world conference of expatriate Greeks will take place in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABeijing%2C%20China"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on the occasion of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2008%20Olympic%20Games"&gt;2008 Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

&lt;a href="w%3AZach%20Johnson"&gt;Zach Johnson&lt;/a&gt; won the 2007 Masters Golf Tournament in &lt;a href="w%3AAugusta%2C%20Georgia"&gt;Augusta, Georgia&lt;/a&gt; Sunday. His score of +1 over par (289) is the second highest score ever recorded for the Masters. He was two strokes ahead of three runners up, &lt;a href="w%3ATiger%20Woods"&gt;Tiger Woods&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARetief%20Goosen"&gt;Retief Goosen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ARory%20Sabbatini"&gt;Rory Sabbatini&lt;/a&gt;.

This is Johnson's first win in a Major Championship, and second &lt;a href="w%3APGA"&gt;PGA&lt;/a&gt; win. He finished in 17th place in the 2005 &lt;a href="w%3APGA%20Championship"&gt;PGA Championship&lt;/a&gt;, but was cut from the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Open"&gt;British Open&lt;/a&gt; three years in a row. Johnson netted $1,305,000 USD for this win.

Tiger Woods, four-time Masters winner and score record holder for the tournament, said "This one's not disappointing, I threw this tournament away on two days when I had two good rounds and I [finished] bogey, bogey. So four bogeys in the last two holes basically cost me the tournament." Woods failed to finish any of the four rounds below par.

Sixteen teams are ready to start the 2007 Stanley Cup Playoffs. The NHL has yet to announce dates and times for all games in the conference quarterfinals, but the first round will begin on April 11 and the match-ups are set as follows, with the top seeded team of each match having home-ice advantage:

<dl>
BULLET::::- Eastern Conference
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%20Sabres"&gt;Buffalo Sabres&lt;/a&gt; (1) vs. &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Islanders"&gt;New York Islanders&lt;/a&gt; (8)

Going into the final day of the regular season, the &lt;a href="w%3AToronto%20Maple%20Leafs"&gt;Toronto Maple Leafs&lt;/a&gt; were ahead of the Islanders by one point and in eighth place in the Eastern Conference, but an Islanders win moved them a point ahead of the Leafs and secured their spot into the playoffs. Last year's champions, the &lt;a href="w%3ACarolina%20Hurricanes"&gt;Carolina Hurricanes&lt;/a&gt;, became the third team to win a Stanley Cup and fail to reach the playoffs the following season.

Having the best regular season record in the league, the Sabres took home the &lt;a href="w%3APresidents%27%20Trophy"&gt;Presidents' Trophy&lt;/a&gt;. The Sabres earned 113 points from 53 wins, 22 losses, and 7 overtime losses. The Red Wings won the Western Conference crown with 113 points from 50 wins, 19 losses, and 13 overtime losses.

The Minnesota Twins, after suffering a cold loss at an even colder &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Cellular%20Field"&gt;U.S. Cellular Field&lt;/a&gt; to the Chicago White Sox on Saturday, needed to heat up their offense for the final game of the series, and with help from &lt;a href="w%3ACy%20Young%20Award"&gt;Cy Young&lt;/a&gt; winner &lt;a href="w%3AJohan%20Santana"&gt;Johan Santana&lt;/a&gt; and AL MVP &lt;a href="w%3AJustin%20Morneau"&gt;Justin Morneau&lt;/a&gt;, they did just that.

Starting pitcher Santana started slow, giving up an unusual three walks in the first couple innings, but turned things around after that, giving up just one hit in seven innings pitched, and throwing nine strikeouts. White Sox starter &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Danks"&gt;John Danks&lt;/a&gt; struck out six, but gave up 4 of the Twins' six hits, plus a three-run homer off the bat of Justin Morneau in the fourth.

The White Sox would respond by hitting a home run of their own, a solo shot off the bat of &lt;a href="w%3AJuan%20Uribe"&gt;Juan Uribe&lt;/a&gt; in the eighth inning, but the Twins would hold them to just that one run, as closer &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Nathan"&gt;Joe Nathan&lt;/a&gt; picked up the save.

Friday's postponed game will likely be rescheduled for the weekend of July 6, the next time the Twins play the White Sox in Chicago.

The White Sox, now 2-3, are hitting the road to Oakland for a three-game series against the &lt;a href="w%3AOakland%20Athletics"&gt;Athletics&lt;/a&gt; starting tomorrow. The White Sox are 4-23 in the past six years at the &lt;a href="w%3AMcAfee%20Coliseum"&gt;McAfee Coliseum&lt;/a&gt;, and hope their starting pitcher &lt;a href="w%3AJose%20Contreras"&gt;Jose Contreras&lt;/a&gt; will bounce back after a rough opening day loss.

The Twins, now 4-1, will head back to Minneapolis to face the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Yankees"&gt;Yankees&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href="w%3ASidney%20Ponson"&gt;Sidney Ponson&lt;/a&gt; making his debut for the Twins.

<h3>Three-year-old New Zealander chokes to death on candy</h3>

The parents did call New Zealand's emergency number, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A1-1-1"&gt;1-1-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , after their son alerted his parents to the fact that he was choking. The paramedics were unable to revive the Napier boy when they arrived at the scene.

The case has been referred to a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acoroner"&gt;coroner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

<h3>Vocational nurse charged with fatal Houston fire</h3>

A vocational nurse working for Dr. John Capriotti, a plastic surgeon, was accused of setting the fire that wounded several and killed three people in Houston, Texas on March 28. She was allegedly trying to cover up the fact that she hadn't completed the paperwork for an upcoming audit.

The fire began in Dr. Capriotti's office on the fifth floor and quickly spread to the sixth. Arson investigators from the Houston Fire Department, the FBI and the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives had been working to determine the source of the fire.

<h3>Iran starts industrial-scale production of nuclear fuel</h3>

&lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; announced that it has started industrial scale production of nuclear fuel involving hundreds of centrifuges. The announcement comes as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20Iran"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="Mahmoud%20Ahmadinejad"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt; reasserts his nation's ♡❤nuclear rights♡❤ in the face of two rounds of sanctions by the &lt;a href="UN"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council"&gt;Security Council&lt;/a&gt;, which is seeking a halt to such work.

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; denounced the declaration, saying it showed Iran was defying the international community.

Major League Baseball is moving the upcoming &lt;a href="w%3AAnaheim%20Angels"&gt;Anaheim Angels&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3ACleveland%20Indians"&gt;Cleveland Indians&lt;/a&gt; series to &lt;a href="w%3AMiller%20Park"&gt;Miller Park&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AMilwaukee%2C%20Wisconsin"&gt;Milwaukee&lt;/a&gt; after snow and cold has led to the cancellation of the Tribe's four-game home opener against the &lt;a href="w%3ASeattle%20Mariners"&gt;Seattle Mariners&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3AJacobs%20Field"&gt;Jacobs Field&lt;/a&gt;. The games, which were rescheduled to be played in double-headers on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, will need to be made-up later this season. A venue change was needed to prevent more postponed games; cold temperatures in &lt;a href="w%3ACleveland%2C%20Ohio"&gt;Cleveland&lt;/a&gt; are forecasted throughout the week, and precipitation is expected Wednesday.

The snow started falling Friday, the day of the Indians home opener against the Mariners, and never let up. After three "snow delays", the game was postponed, just one out away from being considered an "official game". The ground crew has been working nonstop, on Saturday clearing 10 inches off the field only to have it begin to snow heavily just hours before the game, leading to another postponement.

Further complicating matters is the fact that Seattle is not scheduled to return to Cleveland during the regular season, so make-up games would need to be played during the teams' off-days. The Tribe, who haven't played since , haven't been resting either. All players reported Sunday for indoor practice. Cleveland outfielder &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Dellucci"&gt;David Dellucci&lt;/a&gt; said "I've been trying to get a partner to play long toss on the field, and nobody wants to throw with me. I think this is the first time in my career I've wanted to throw and no one wanted to. Usually, it's the other way around."

On the fourth anniversary of Baghdad's fall to &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; forces, tens if not hundreds of thousands of &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;is marched peacefully in protest of the continued occupation. Wearing Iraqi flags, demonstrators marched from &lt;a href="w%3AKufa"&gt;Kufa&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3ANajaf"&gt;Najaf&lt;/a&gt; chanting "Get out, get out occupier!" Many were dancing through the streets as police kept an eye on the proceedings and lined the route.

The rally was largely &lt;a href="w%3AShi%27ite"&gt;Shi'ite&lt;/a&gt;, as it had been ordered by controversial cleric &lt;a href="w%3AMuqtada%20al-Sadr"&gt;Muqtada al-Sadr&lt;/a&gt;. Leaflets were scattered about, reading "Yes, Yes to Muqtada!" and "Yes, Yes to Iraq!" Some demonstrators shouted "we obey your call," seemingingly in response to al-Sadr's statements on Sunday.

Al-Sadr called the demonstration in a statement that was distributed in Najaf yesterday. In the statement he ordered for his supporters to stop attacking their fellow Iraqis and instead work to fight the American occupiers. He also encouraged the Iraqi army and police to stop cooperating with America. "You, the Iraqi army and police forces, don't walk alongside the occupiers, because they are your archenemy," the statement said. "God has ordered you to be patient in front of your enemy, and unify your efforts against them - not against the sons of Iraq."

&lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Carr"&gt;David Carr&lt;/a&gt;, the first pick in &lt;a href="w%3AHouston%20Texans"&gt;Houston Texans&lt;/a&gt; history, and the first overall pick of the &lt;a href="w%3A2002%20NFL%20Draft"&gt;2002 NFL Draft&lt;/a&gt; was signed Friday by the &lt;a href="w%3ACarolina%20Panthers"&gt;Carolina Panthers&lt;/a&gt;. Carr will serve as backup to current starter &lt;a href="w%3AJake%20Delhomme"&gt;Jake Delhomme&lt;/a&gt;.

Carr, a five-year starting quarterback for the Texans, completed 60 percent of his passes, but threw 65 interceptions and was sacked 249 times. He completed 68.3 percent of his passes last season, a career high. Carr was sacked 249 times in the past five seasons with the Texans, and was released by the organization after they made a trade with the &lt;a href="w%3AAtlanta%20Falcons"&gt;Atlanta Falcons&lt;/a&gt; to acquire &lt;a href="w%3AMatt%20Schaub"&gt;Matt Schaub&lt;/a&gt;, who had served as the backup quarterback to &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Vick"&gt;Michael Vick&lt;/a&gt;.

The Panthers were in need of a quality backup quarterback after releasing seven-year veteran &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Weinke"&gt;Chris Weinke&lt;/a&gt; in March. Weinke had struggled last season, leading the team to a 1-2 record during an injury to Delhomme. 

The move means the Panthers now have the top two picks from the 2002 draft. Carolina selected defensive end &lt;a href="w%3AJulius%20Peppers"&gt;Julius Peppers&lt;/a&gt; with No. 2 pick. The Panthers have not done much outside of the Carr deal this off-season, with 21 of last season's 22 starting players returning to the team.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Jimbo%20Wales%20to%20lead%20development%20of%20%27code%20of%20conduct%27%20for%20bloggers&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The code is expected to address issues of free speech and the practice of allowing mean-spirited comments made by users to remain in the blogosphere. It will also address a perceived need to delete posted comments, particularly those by anonymous users, that are at odds with the code of conduct. Under consideration is the question of whether it is an admissible action in a public forum to delete a comment if it meets one of several objectionable reasons for removing it.

"That is one of the mistakes a lot of people make, believing that uncensored speech is the most free when in fact, managed civil dialogue is actually the freer speech," said O'Reilly.

Some of the proposed rules of the code, as it is being discussed, might include: 

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤We are committed to the "Civility Enforced" standard: we will not post unacceptable content, and we'll delete comments that contain it.♡❤

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤We define unacceptable content as anything included or linked to that:♡❤

</ul>
The code is a draft proposal undergoing development at &lt;a href="w%3AWikia"&gt;Wikia&lt;/a&gt;, a privately held web hosting company founded by Wales and &lt;a href="w%3AAngela%20Beesley"&gt;Angela Beesley&lt;/a&gt;.

"If it's a carefully constructed set of principles, it could carry a lot of weight even if not everyone agrees," said Wales.

The reception of the code is mixed, but there are many bloggers who feel that such a code of conduct would reduce the effects of unpleasant or malicious speech. "I’ve been assaulted and harassed online for four years," Richard Silverstein of ♡❤richardsilverstein.com♡❤ said. "Most of it I can take in stride. But you just never get used to that level of hatred."

<h1>Football: Easter Monday Premiership roundup</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Football%3A%20Easter%20Monday%20Premiership%20roundup&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

With the English Premiership nearing its completion, relegation battles have reached their peak. Six matches were scheduled for Easter Monday, and with Manchester United, Chelsea, and Liverpool all preparing for their Champions League matches, the limelight of the day shifted to the bottom half of the table. Only ten points separated the eighteenth and eleventh seeded teams before Mondays matches got underway, and several clubs were looking to reach the forty point mark on the season, usually recognized as a relegation safety zone. In other matches, European places were on the line, with Bolton Wanderers only two points off third place Arsenal, the race for the last Champion's League was close. Portsmouth were also looking to secure a spot in the UEFA Cup for next season, as they visited last place Watford, who are destined for relegation this season.

<h2>Matches</h2>
<h4>Fulham 1 - 3 Manchester City</h4>
With both teams struggling to stay out of relegation contention, Manchester City earned themselves a valuable three points away from home. Only two points separated the teams at the beginning of the match, but Manchester City had been in better form as of late, only recently having passed Fulham in the standings. Joey Barton opened the scoring of City twenty-one minutes into the match, and DeMarcus Beasly doubled the visitors lead fifteen minutes later. After the break, City continued to pressure, and were rewarded with a third goal from Darius Vassell, guaranteeing them three points on the afternoon. Fulham's Carlos Bocanegra struck one for the Cottagers in the seventy-sixth minute, but it was too little too late as Manchester City continued their strong away form. The win puts City on forty points for the season, likely guaranteeing them to stay out of relegation. Fulham on the other hand haven't won in nine matches, and have dropped dangerously close to the bottom three, only four points ahead of Sheffield United.

<h4>Newcastle United 0 - 0 Arsenal</h4>
With Bolton hot on their trails for the final Champions League spot, Arsenal dropped valuable points at St. James' Park Monday. In a lackluster affair, both teams showed great commitment, but neither side could muster the magic to take home three points. Newcastle, now safe from relegation, are looking to grab the last UEFA Cup spot, though they are seven points off of Tottenham currently. Arsenal have had a poor run of form as of late, loosing their last two previous games to West Ham and Liverpool.

<h4>Watford 4 - 2 Portsmouth</h4>
Watford earned their most impressive win of the season Monday as they defeated Portsmouth comfortably. Having just beaten league leaders Manchester United on Sunday, Portsmouth are in the running for a UEFA Cup place, and the loss sets them back on their goals. Watford, though surely to be relegated, showed why they were in the Premiership as they came from behind to win. Matthew Taylor put Portsmouth in the lead on sixteen minutes, but Hameur Bouazza scored on a penalty in the eighteenth minute to draw Watford level. The Hornets then went on a scoring spree, with Gavin Mahon and Tomas Priskin scoring before Bouazza netted his second on the day. Substitue Arnold Makengo snuck one back for Pompey, but the scoreline stayed at 4-2. Watford's win gives them a morale boost before their FA Cup semi-final meeting with Manchester United, while Pompey take on Newcastle next in the league as they hope to get back to winning ways.

<h4>Bolton 1 - 1 Everton</h4>
Having watched Arsenal tie earlier in the day, Bolton had the chance to jump into fourth spot in the league, but were held to a frustrating draw by the visiting Toffee's. Both goals came in the first half with Kevin Davies first scoring for Bolton, and eighteen year old James Vaughaun levelling the scoreline on thirty-three minutes. The goal is Vaughauns second in two games, as the young man looks to impress manager David Moyes. Unfortunately for Vaughaun, who is no stranger to injury, he had to be stretchered off in the second half of the match as he appeared to have severed an artery. The tie leaves Everton three points clear of sixth place Tottenham, who have a game in hand, and keeps them three points behind fifth place Bolton. Everton's next game is at home to relegation strugglers Charlton Athletic, while Bolton have a huge game against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium in London.

<h4>Aston Villa 1 - 1 Wigan</h4>
Ten man Wigan snuck a draw from Villa Park as they continued their search for relegation safety. Emile Heskey gave the Latics the lead after twenty-one minutes, but a dangerous two footed tackle by Luis Valecnia saw the Ecuadorian red carded, and Wigan reduced to ten men. The Latics held on to the draw through the halftime break, but a scrappy goal which bounced fortuitously off Gabriel Abonglahor past keeper John Filan levelled the game deservably for Aston Villa. The draw leaves Wigan only three points clear of eighteenth place Sheffield United, as the Latics take on Tottenham next in the league. Aston Villa are now only one point away from the forty point haven, and they will look to jump ahead of Middlesbrough next Saturday when the two meet at the Riverside.

<h4>Charlton Athletic 0 - 0 Reading</h4>
Steve Coppel's Reading visited Alan Pardew's Charlton Monday, as a spirited draw was played out at The Valley. Charlton's form has improved greatly over the past few games, as they have not lost in six games, and they have crawled out of the relegation zone for the time being. Reading's impressive season leaves them nowhere near relegation, and they are in a battle for a UEFA Cup place. The draw leaves Charlton one point up on eighteenth place Sheffield, while Reading slight drop in form has knocked them down to ninth spot. Charlton visit Everton on the fifteenth, while Reading will look to get back to winning ways at home to Fulham on the fourteenth.

Reports have emerged that the British government allowed the British soldiers newly released from Iranian captivity to sell their stories to the media, after it had banned the rest of the British military from doing so. This double standard has drawn criticism from the media and families of troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The 15 sailors were allegedly found and captured in Iranian waters. They caused an uproar in the UK when it was discovered that they revealed information quickly and easily, and were very compliant when asked to write confessions and statements. Retired colonel Bob Stewart mourned the loss of the "old school" attitude towards revealing nothing when captured:

The government decided that the release of information would lessen the impact of criticism in the media and the popular conception that the troops had easily buckled under the pressure of the Iranian government. 

The first media interviews appeared on Monday and were published in both the Sun and Daily Mirror newspapers. The payment was not disclosed to the public but reports stated that the amounts paid were 5 or 6 figure sums.

One sailor, Faye Turney, the only female in the group, stated that their confessions were forced under duress and the reports from the Iranian governments were false. Her interview came after an Iranian PR maneuver to counter claims that the government mistreated and inhumanely held the captives by broadcasting videos of the 15 watching T.V, eating food, and playing chess. Turney, 25, also stated that she was separated from her colleagues soon after being captured and held in solitary confinement for days on end. This conforms to her colleagues statements, who said that they too were put into solitary confinement and were unjustly treated.

Another sailor, Arthur Bachelor, 20 and the youngest in the group, told the Daily mirror that he was led to fear that he was to be executed and expected the worst from his captors and tormentors. These "soft" sailors go against a history of "stiff upper lip" behavior that was expected from troops in previous generations of soldiers. His officer, Royal Marine Captain Chris Air, has sympathized with his colleagues and believes that they have every right to ask for payment for their stories; he did not accept offers made to him by the media. He believed that telling their stories would "be part of the process to get things off their minds".

The leader of the captured group, Royal Navy Lieutenant Felix Carman, said he believed that accepting money for their ordeal was wrong. However, he told the media, he doesn't hate people who have been though an awful ordeal, and was fine with their "making a bit of money out of this". 

Not everyone was as sympathetic to the released servicemen's ordeal. Families of servicemen and women in Iraq and Afghanistan have cried out in outrage over they way the soldiers handled their capture and the profit that they made out of it. Reg Keys, father of Thomas a soldier killed in Iraq, said:

The British Military and Defense Ministry declared the capture and release of the 15 sailors "exceptional circumstances" and in their case lifted its policy on banning military members from talking to the media.

The former defense secretary of Britain, Micheal Heseltine, believed that it was a great injustice to allow the 15 to ask for payment for their stories:

For many people, it is hard to understand why the 15 were so compliant towards the Iranian government, why they so readily gave away information and what happened to the hard-cut, no-nonsense military of past eras. The 15 were well treated when contrasted against former POW's, who suffered horrific torture and punishment without giving up a single word of useful information, and with the emerging videos of the well-treated captured troops, public trust and respect for the military has been struck a horrific blow.

Sunderland is the new leader of the Coca Cola Championship after a 2-1 victory over Southampton on Monday night. Roy Keane's side has been storming up the table in past weeks, having not lost since the sixth of January, a total of sixteen games. Both teams are in the hunt for promotion, with Sunderland likely to qualify automatically. Southampton on the other hand has a chance to qualify for the Premiership through the playoffs. Leon Best and Marek Saganowski were started as strikers for Southampton, while Sunderland started David Connolly and Stephen Elliott up front.

The first half was played out evenly, with Sunderland getting the better of the chances as David Connolly struck the post. Southampton started the scoring in the second half when Marek Saganowski poked home a cut back cross by Danny Guthrie. Carlos Edwards tied up the match for Sunderland ten minutes later from a high quality strike. The Trinidad international gathered the ball on the right, cut to his left, and unleashed a cannon into the top corner past keeper Bartosz Bialkowski. As the game neared its end, Sunderland scored the winner through substitute Grant Leadbitter, as his equally powerful shot was beyond Bialkowski, giving 
the Black Cats the three points.

With third place Birmingham City loosing in Barnsley and second place Derby County tying Coventry, first place in the league is left for the Black Cats with only five games remaining in the season. The loss leaves Southampton out of the playoff picture for the time being, but they are only one point back of sixth place Preston North End.

<h3>Australia to send more troops to Afghanistan</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister of Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; said he will send an extra 300 ground troops and 75 air force personnel to &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; to help the &lt;a href="w%3ANATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt;-run &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Security%20Assistance%20Force"&gt;International Security Assistance Force&lt;/a&gt; counter &lt;a href="w%3ATaliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt; insurgents. The deterioration of the security situation in Afghanistan has necessitated we send this additional commitment, he said.

<h3>Moroccan police raid has deadly end</h3>

Early Tuesday morning, &lt;a href="Morocco"&gt;Moroccan&lt;/a&gt; police raided a house in a &lt;a href="w%3ACasablanca"&gt;Casablanca&lt;/a&gt; slum looking for a gang of militants that had been wanted for a March 11 suicide bombing at a &lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20cafe"&gt;cybercafe&lt;/a&gt;. During the raid, two suspects detonated a suicide belts, killing themselves. Two others led police on a rooftop chase that eventually ended with one suspect being shot by police and another blowing himself up when cornered.

Police said they believed the bombers had started wearing the belts full-time to prevent being taken alive. Two police and a child were injured in the explosions.

<h3>Russia expresses doubt about Iranian "industrial scale" claims</h3>

Analysts have said that past claims by &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; about progress, while glossing over technical glitches, have served to strengthen its bargaining hand with the West, while it is probably several years from being able to make a bomb.

<h1>Florida and Puerto Rican manatees may be removed from 'endangered species list'</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Florida%20and%20Puerto%20Rican%20manatees%20may%20be%20removed%20from%20%27endangered%20species%20list%27&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The announcement was made in the USFWS's 5-year review of the manatee. In the review, the manatees were found to have "increased in numbers" over the last 40 years and that there were no new threats posed to the mammals.

In the section of the report that is called the 1996 Distinct Population Segment or [DPS], the review states "the species under review" is "not listed as a DPS" and that "there [is no] relevant new information that would lead us to consider listing manatees in Florida as a DPS in accordance with the 1996 policy."

"If there isn't any other message in this report, it's that recovery is attainable. We just believe it fits the definition of threatened better than it fits the definition of endangered," said the Fish and Wildlife Service's supervisor for the field, Dave Hankla.

"Based on the science, it is clear that manatees are no longer facing extinction in all or a significant portion of its range," added Hankla.

An endangered species is usually considered a species which are very likely to become extinct immediately. Threatened species can usually be saved if large measures to protect them are immediately taken.

Scientists were also able to get a close count to the exact numbers of manatees that are currently living off Florida's coast and in the waterways of Florida to 2,812. Only 1,267 were found to be living in Florida's waters in 1991.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; state of &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; (NSW) launched its latest anti-&lt;a href="w%3ACannabis"&gt;cannabis&lt;/a&gt; campaign in &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; today. The campaign, which specifically targets 14 to 19 year-olds aims to reduce the number of young people experimenting with the drug. The advertisements follow a tightening of cannabis laws in NSW last year.

The campaign, which NSW Health has cost at &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Dollar"&gt;AUD&lt;/a&gt;$600,000 will use a variety of print ads placed at bus stops and in youth magazines in addition to advertisements on websites such as &lt;a href="w%3AMySpace"&gt;MySpace&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMSN"&gt;MSN&lt;/a&gt;. Print ads use a tag line saying "Pot. It mightn't kill you, but it could turn you into a dickhead".

The advertisements show a person staring from a black and white photo with quotes like "You've got great eyes, when they're not bloodshot" and "I'd lend you money, but you still owe me from last time".

The director of drug and alcohol programs with NSW Health, David McGrath said many young people believed that cannabis was safe and its use was normal. "There is still a significant cohort of people who think, particularly with the young person's age group, that cannabis is normal," Mr McGrath said.

Mr McGrath said despite the number of young cannabis users had halved from forty percent to twenty percent, but claimed more needed to be done. "We want to prevent people who are thinking about taking cannabis up from taking it up and also encouraging those people that are using cannabis to cease," he said.

Mr McGrath said young people had to be warned about the possible consequences of smoking cannabis, such as the alleged link with mental illnesss and how it may affect social interaction and physical health.

NSW Health Minister, Reba Meagher said a recent study indicated that while cannabis use among young people is in decline, almost one third of teenagers have tried cannabis. She also claimed that cannabis remained common within the community. "Cannabis is a drug that is readily available in our community and it does come with serious risk," she said.

&lt;a href="w%3AMiami%20Dolphins"&gt;Miami Dolphins&lt;/a&gt; running back &lt;a href="w%3ARicky%20Williams"&gt;Ricky Williams&lt;/a&gt;, who has applied for reinstatement to the &lt;a href="w%3ANFL"&gt;NFL&lt;/a&gt;, told &lt;a href="w%3AESPN%20Radio"&gt;ESPN Radio's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADan%20Patrick"&gt;Dan Patrick&lt;/a&gt; on Friday that he hasn't gotten high on drugs "in maybe three years." Williams credited &lt;a href="w%3AYoga"&gt;yoga&lt;/a&gt; with replacing drugs to ease stress.

Williams was suspended in April 2006 for violating the NFL's Substance Abuse Policy. Reinstatement to the league requires clinical evaluation and sending a hand-written letter to &lt;a href="w%3ARoger%20Goodell"&gt;Roger Goodell&lt;/a&gt;, commissioner of the NFL. Williams stated: ♡❤For the most part, as long as you follow the rules, you have a pretty good shot to be reinstated. Half of it is testing and the other half is you have to talk to someone on a weekly basis.♡❤

During the radio broadcast, Patrick asked Williams when the last time he had been drug tested. Williams' anwser was ♡❤Two minutes ago.♡❤ and that he had passed.

Williams blamed the high levels of stress involved in playing football with his use of Marijuana. He said the only way to deal with it was "to go home, relax on the couch, roll up a joint and take a couple of puffs."

Williams told Patrick during the interview that he hadn't spoken with new Dolphins head coach &lt;a href="w%3ACam%20Cameron"&gt;Cam Cameron&lt;/a&gt; yet. Addressing what the Dolphins may or may not choose to do with him, Williams said that he would be "fine with whatever happens."

Williams said, when asked why he wants to return to the NFL: "For me, it's a test to see if all this work I've done is really worth something. If I can go to the NFL and have success, that would speak a lot for yoga and what I've learned and offer a lot of people who have dealt with the same issues I have a way out."

A &lt;a href="w%3APegasus%20Airlines"&gt;Pegasus Airline&lt;/a&gt; flight carrying 178 passengers was hijacked today by a man named Mehmet Gökşin Göl. The plane took off from the town of &lt;a href="w%3ADiyarbak%C4%B1r"&gt;Diyarbakır&lt;/a&gt; and headed toward &lt;a href="w%3AIstanbul%2C%20Turkey"&gt;Istanbul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATurkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;'s most populated city. 

Göl later gave himself up and surrendered to authorities at Ankara international airport in Turkey. Reports say he was attempting to divert the flight to &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; and that he is suffering from a mental illness.

All passengers are safe and have been removed from the plane and there are no reports of injuries.

The man, identified as Mehmet Gökşin Göl, entered the cockpit and threatened to blow up the plane, claiming to have an explosive device on board, Ankara Deputy Governor Hayati Soylu said. The man was not armed and did not have explosives.

He was detained at Ankara's Esenboğa airport where pilots landed the Pegasus airline flight, which was going from Diyarbakır to Istanbul.

There were 178 passengers on board, including three babies, the airline said. None of the passengers were hurt.

There was no information as to why the man wanted to divert the plane to Iran.

Fırat Keleş, a passenger on board, told a Turkish television network that the man could be seen reading the Koran during the flight. There was no panic on board, he said.

This incident occurred six months after a man hijacked a flight en route to Istanbul in October 2006.

&lt;a href="Manchester%20United"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt; advanced to the semi-finals of the &lt;a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League"&gt;Champions League&lt;/a&gt; after a thumping of &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href="AS%20Roma"&gt;AS Roma&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday night. Holding a 2-1 advantage after the first leg, Roma travelled to Old Trafford in hopes of knocking Manchester United out of the competition, ruining their hopes of a treble. The winning goal scorer from the first leg, Marko Vucinic, had to replace the ill Rodrigo Taddei for Roma, and he was paired with Roma's talisman striker Francesco Totti. Louis Saha was still out through injury for United, so Alan Smith started his fourth match of the season with strike partner &lt;a href="Wayne%20Rooney"&gt;Wayne Rooney&lt;/a&gt;. 

Roma started the match quite strongly with several attempts early. David Pizarro first blasted a long drive wide before Totti came close with a 25-yard shot. Michael Carrick then opened the scoring for United as he was supplied the ball by &lt;a href="Cristiano%20Ronaldo"&gt;Ronaldo&lt;/a&gt;, and the Englishman's shot curled past Doni. Some quick counterattacking football then earned United their second goal as Brown, Rooney, Carrick, and Heinze all combined to get the ball out to Giggs. His pass into Smith left Doni exposed, and the striker scored his first goal since returning from injury. A third goal was scored only minutes later after play from Ronaldo and Smith released Giggs on the right, and his cross was turned in by Rooney off the post. Roma finally had a chance to respond through De Rossi, but his header from Pizarro's cross was sent over the bar. Ronaldo was then knocking on the door for Uniteds fourth, as he fizzled a shot just wide, and had a free kick blocked by a stretching Doni. The Portuguese winger would score just before the break however, as more good work by Giggs gave Ronaldo room to maneuver, and he sprinted in before firing a low shot into the corner. Van Der Sar was then called into action to bat away a hard free kick by Totti, but the scoreline stayed 4-0 into the break.

Totti started off the chances in the second half with a free kick that went just wide, but United would score again only four minutes in. Giggs was again the supplier as his low cross was knocked in by a lunging Ronaldo, his twentieth goal of the season. Roma looked for a consolation goal, but it looked as if United would not even conceed that as Darren Fletcher cleared Allesandro Mancini's header off the line. Carrick then earned himself a brace on the night, as he blasted home a 25 yard drive into the top corner. Giggs was then replaced by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and the Norweigen nearly added another goal as he lofted the ball on to the top of the net. Roma finally got their goal in the 69th minute through Daniel De Rossi as his fine coushioned volley from Totti's cross was beyond Van Der Sar. Substitute Patrice Evra then rounded out the scoring in the 81'st minute after a nice interchange of play between himself, Solskjaer, and Rooney, the defender hit in a low shot off the post. Ronaldo, in search of a hat-trick, pushed forward near the end of the game, but his low drive was saved well by Doni.

Manchester United will now move on to face either &lt;a href="AC%20Milan"&gt;AC Milan&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="Bayern%20Munich"&gt;Bayern Munich&lt;/a&gt; in the next round of the Champions League, and their next match is the FA Cup semi-final against Watford. Roma meanwhile take on Sampdoria next in the Serie A, though they no longer have a chance to catch leaders Internazionale.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFulham%20FC"&gt;Fulham FC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; coach &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Coleman"&gt;Chris Coleman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was sacked Tuesday, the day after a disappointing 3-1 loss to &lt;a href="Manchester%20City"&gt;Manchester City&lt;/a&gt;. 

Fulham's form has been poor as of late, with the team not winning in their past seven games. The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEaster"&gt;Easter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; weekend was especially harsh for the Cottagers, as they leaked seven goals, only scoring two themselves in games against &lt;a href="Everton%20F.C."&gt;Everton&lt;/a&gt; and Manchester City. The drop in form has put Fulham dangerously near relegation, and with the bottom teams currently stepping up their form, Fulham management decided it was time for a change.

Assistant coach &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Kean"&gt;Steve Kean&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has also been released from the club, and Fulham has made an agreement with the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIrish%20FA"&gt;Irish FA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for &lt;a href="Northern%20Ireland"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt; boss &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALawrie%20Sanchez"&gt;Lawrie Sanchez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to take control of the team in a caretaker position for the remainder of the season.

Coleman has been with Fulham for ten years, four as the manager. He coached the team for 176 games, winning 61, drawing 44, and loosing 71. 

Sanchez's first match in charge will come against &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AReading%20F.C."&gt;Reading&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on the 14th of April. Other games remaining in the season for Fulham include matches against &lt;a href="Arsenal%20F.C."&gt;Arsenal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Liverpool%20F.C."&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt;.

A fast-moving fire engulfed the home of late singer &lt;a href="w%3AJohnny%20Cash"&gt;Johnny Cash&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday. The lake-side home, located in &lt;a href="w%3AHendersonville%2C%20Tennessee"&gt;Hendersonville, Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;, was the home of the late singer and his wife, &lt;a href="w%3AJune%20Carter"&gt;June Carter&lt;/a&gt;, from the late 1960s until their deaths in 2003.

The home was purchased by former &lt;a href="w%3ABee%20Gees"&gt;Bee Gees&lt;/a&gt; singer &lt;a href="w%3ABarry%20Gibb"&gt;Barry Gibb&lt;/a&gt; in 2006, and was undergoing renovations at the time. The cause of the fire is unknown at this time, but it is believed that a flammable wood preservative that construction workers had applied contributed to the speed in which the flames spread. Firefighters responded within 5 minutes of the fire breaking out. No workers were killed in the fire, but one firefighter suffered minor injuries.

"Maybe it's the good Lord's way to make sure that it was only Johnny's house," said &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Sterban"&gt;Richard Sterban&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Oak%20Ridge%20Boys"&gt;The Oak Ridge Boys&lt;/a&gt;, who lived down the road from Cash. Neighbor &lt;a href="w%3AMarty%20Stuart"&gt;Marty Stewart&lt;/a&gt; said "So many prominent things and prominent people in American history took place in that house—everyone from Billy Graham to Bob Dylan went into that house." The home was where Cash wrote many of his hit songs, and appeared in the Cash music video for "&lt;a href="w%3AHurt%20%28song%29"&gt;Hurt&lt;/a&gt;".

's home run streak was extended Tuesday in the Yankee's win over the Twins in &lt;a href="w%3AMinneapolis%2C%20Minnesota"&gt;Minneapolis&lt;/a&gt;. A-Rod hit a two-run shot off of Twins starter &lt;a href="w%3ABoof%20Bonser"&gt;Boof Bonser&lt;/a&gt; in the first inning, making it the fourth game in a row that he has cleared the fence. Bonser gave up six hits and seven runs in the four and one third innings he pitched, including a &lt;a href="w%3AJohnny%20Damon"&gt;Johnny Damon&lt;/a&gt; three-run homer over the right field wall in the fifth inning. before being relieved by &lt;a href="w%3AJesse%20Crain"&gt;Jesse Crain&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3ADennys%20Reyes"&gt;Dennys Reyes&lt;/a&gt; pitched the final inning, giving up three runs to bring the Yankee's lead to nine runs.

&lt;a href="w%3AAndy%20Pettitte"&gt;Andy Pettitte&lt;/a&gt; threw six shutout innings, allowing only four hits. Minnesota's only run came from a &lt;a href="w%3AJason%20Kubel"&gt;Jason Kubel&lt;/a&gt; sacrifice fly in the seventh inning, scoring &lt;a href="w%3AJustin%20Morneau"&gt;Justin Morneau&lt;/a&gt; from third base. The Twins had many opportunities to score early, but ended up leaving their runners in scoring position without any hits to bring them home.

The Twins and Yankees will wrap up the series tomorrow, each hoping for a win to stay above .500. &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Mussina"&gt;Mike Mussina&lt;/a&gt; will be starting for the Yanks, and &lt;a href="w%3ARamon%20Ortiz"&gt;Ramon Ortiz&lt;/a&gt; will be starting for the Twins.

<h3>Charges dropped in Duke lacrosse rape case</h3>

North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper dropped all charges against three &lt;a href="w%3ADuke%20University"&gt;Duke University&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ALacrosse"&gt;lacrosse&lt;/a&gt; players. He said the athletes were innocent victims of a “tragic rush to accuse” by an overreaching district attorney, namely &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Nifong"&gt;Mike Nifong&lt;/a&gt;. The year-long &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Duke%20University%20lacrosse%20team%20scandal"&gt;case&lt;/a&gt; saw Reade Seligmann, David Evans and Collin Finnerty indicted for rape, kidnapping and sexual assault charges tied to an alleged attack at a lacrosse team party on March 13, 2006.

<h3>Sadrist Movement threatens to leave Iraqi government</h3>

Controversial cleric &lt;a href="w%3AMuqtada%20al-Sadr"&gt;Muqtada al-Sadr&lt;/a&gt; criticized &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Iraq"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ANouri%20al-Maliki"&gt;Nouri al-Maliki&lt;/a&gt;'s lack of support for a timetable for a &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; withdrawal from &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. Although it is not the first time the &lt;a href="w%3ASadrist%20Movement"&gt;Sadrist Movement&lt;/a&gt; has threatened to leave the government, a statement released by the bloc said: "The Sadrist movement is studying the option of withdrawing from the Iraqi government - a government that has not fulfilled its promises to the people ... We are serious about withdrawing."

Al-Maliki's coalition relied on the Sadrist Movement to give it the mandate needed to form a government and the withdrawal could threaten to topple the government. The Sadrist Movement holds six ministerial positions and represents about a quarter of the MPs in the coalition.

The first target was the Government Palace, the main offices of the government, located in downtown Algiers, killing 12 people and wounding 118, according to civil defense. Several cars were burned out, while the Government Palace sustained some heavy damage, as well as the rest of the neighborhood. The other target was the police station of Bab Ezzouar, east of Algiers, causing the death of 11 people and wounding 44 others. Civil defense authorities and witnesses say that these bombings were carried out by suicide bombers.

Canadian MP &lt;a href="w%3ABelinda%20Stronach"&gt;Belinda Stronach&lt;/a&gt; has officially announced she will not run for re-election in her riding of &lt;a href="w%3ANewmarket%E2%80%94Aurora"&gt;Newmarket—Aurora&lt;/a&gt; in the next federal election. She will re-join her father &lt;a href="w%3AFrank%20Stronach"&gt;Frank Stronach&lt;/a&gt;'s company &lt;a href="w%3AMagna%20International"&gt;Magna International Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, a large auto parts company, as the executive vice-chairwoman.

"My father is looking to the future, the company is facing important strategic decisions, and the Canadian and global auto sector and economy are in a period of great challenge," Stronach announced. "So I am stepping aside from elected politics for the time being and will now take part in public life in a different way...I will continue to represent the interests of the constituents I serve until such time as a federal election is called," she said. "I also plan to continue to play an active role in the community."

During Stronach's career a series of events have made national headlines.

In 2004, she ran against now Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt; for leadership of then the new formed &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Conservative Party of Canada&lt;/a&gt; and finished second on the first ballot. She was later elected as Conservative MP for Newmarket—Aurora. Stronach had many differences to Stephen Harper and his Conservatives supporting abortion and same-sex marriages. She also claimed the party was going too far-right. In 2005, two days before a &lt;a href="w%3Anon-confidence"&gt;non-confidence&lt;/a&gt; vote to bring down the Liberal government, she &lt;a href="w%3Acrossing%20the%20floor"&gt;crossed the floor&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Liberal Party of Canada&lt;/a&gt; and retained her seat. Upon her crossing she immediately became &lt;a href="w%3AMinister%20of%20Human%20Resources%20and%20Social%20Development%20%28Canada%29"&gt;Minister of Human Resources and Social Development&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMinister%20Responsible%20for%20Democratic%20Renewal%20%28Canada%29"&gt;Minister responsible for Democratic Renewal&lt;/a&gt;. It also ended her personal relationship with fellow Conservative MP &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20MacKay"&gt;Peter MacKay&lt;/a&gt;. If Stronach had not joined the Liberals an election would have been called. On April 6, 2006, Stronach held a news conference announcing that she would not seek the leadership of the Liberals, which was later won by &lt;a href="w%3AStephane%20Dion"&gt;Stephane Dion&lt;/a&gt;.

In September, she was caught cheating with former NHL player &lt;a href="w%3ATie%20Domi"&gt;Tie Domi&lt;/a&gt;. In October 2006, Peter MacKay referred to Stranach as a "dog". Stronach, a &lt;a href="w%3Afeminist"&gt;feminist&lt;/a&gt;, demanded an immediate apology and said that it offended all Canadian women.

CTV bureau chief Robert Fife speculated the decision by Stronach, not to seek re-election, may have had something to do with her dissatisfaction over a diminished role in the new Dion caucus. "She did not have a high-profile critic's role and she had not been prominent in asking questions in question period after Mr. Dion took over," suggested Fife.

Stronach has been serving as &lt;a href="w%3ACritic%20for%20Competitiveness%20and%20the%20New%20Economy"&gt;Critic for Competitiveness and New Economy&lt;/a&gt;. She previously served as &lt;a href="w%3AMinister%20of%20Transport%20%28Canada%29"&gt;Critic for the Minister of Transport&lt;/a&gt; under interim leader &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Graham"&gt;Bill Graham&lt;/a&gt;.

The public is also questioning Stronach's move to keep her seat until the next federal election, they happen every five years or less. If she had decided to leave her seat completely, an immediate &lt;a href="w%3Aby-election"&gt;by-election&lt;/a&gt; would be called.

Military officials have confirmed that two &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; soldiers were killed in two separate road-side bombings targeting the same convoy within hours of each other in southern &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday night. The bombings occurred about 38 kilometres west of Kandahar said Colonel Mike Cessford, deputy commander of Task Force Afghanistan in a late-night briefing.
Another three were injured but according to reports they are in stable condition. A &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Forces"&gt;Canadian Forces&lt;/a&gt; tanker truck was damaged. All the soldiers are from &lt;a href="w%3ACFB%20Petawawa"&gt;CFB Petawawa&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3APetawawa%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Petawawa, Ontario&lt;/a&gt;. A bomb also exploded at around noon but no one sustained injuries.

The two road-side bombings took place in the same general area, about a kilometre apart. In the first incident a soldier was injured, while the second road-side bomb, approximately two hours later, killed the two soldiers. The names of the dead soldiers are being withheld until the families are notified. Colonel Cessford provided the details to reporters in &lt;a href="w%3AKandahar"&gt;Kandahar&lt;/a&gt; Thursday morning. "There was a significant separation between the two incidents," said Cessford. "These were two separate vehicles from two separate areas that were in roughly the same area."

Six Canadian soldiers that were killed in southern Afghanistan last Sunday were returned to &lt;a href="w%3ACFB%20Trenton"&gt;CFB Trenton&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ATrenton%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Trenton, Ontario&lt;/a&gt; today.

53 Canadian soldiers have been killed in the war-torn country since 2002.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; Water Resources Minister, &lt;a href="w%3AMalcolm%20Turnbull"&gt;Malcolm Turnbull&lt;/a&gt; will release a report in &lt;a href="w%3ABrisbane"&gt;Brisbane&lt;/a&gt; today which suggests the piping of water from rivers in Northern &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; to South-East &lt;a href="w%3AQueensland"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt; would be a cost-effective solution to water supply problems in drought stricken South-East Queensland.

The report comes just days after South-East Queensland was placed on level 5 water restrictions, the second most severe and the emergence of a report by the Queensland government recommending the construction of a &lt;a href="w%3ADesalination"&gt;desalination&lt;/a&gt; plant north of Brisbane to tackle the region's water crisis. 

According to newspapers published by &lt;a href="w%3ANews%20Limited"&gt;News Limited&lt;/a&gt;, the National Water Commission report, which was compiled by the Snowy Mountains Energy Corporation outlines five proposals for piping water from Northern NSW into Queensland. Four of those include damming the &lt;a href="w%3AClarence%20River%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29"&gt;Clarence River&lt;/a&gt; and pumping water to the &lt;a href="w%3ALogan%20River"&gt;Logan River&lt;/a&gt; and one suggesting to dam the &lt;a href="w%3ATweed%20River"&gt;Tweed River&lt;/a&gt; and pumping water to the &lt;a href="w%3ANerang%20River"&gt;Nerang River&lt;/a&gt;.

The water commission report argues that the best solution over the long-term would be to damn the Clarence River above Duck Creek.

It is believed that should the plan go ahead, the federal government will spend hundreds of millions of dollars on the project. The report argues that the piping of water from NSW would cost less than water recycling, desalination or the proposed dam at Traveston Crossing.

The report is expected to gain only minor attention from the Queensland government, which claims that it is too far to pump water from NSW.

Queensland's opposition leader, &lt;a href="w%3AJeff%20Seeney"&gt;Jeff Seeney&lt;/a&gt; said the government should of looked at the possibility of getting water from NSW long ago and that the distance water is to be piped is much shorter than the Traveston Crossing Dam peoposal. "The northern river proposal is talking about piping water over a much shorter distance than the Traveston proposal, so it is likely to be much more cost effective," he said.

The report warned of the difficulty the proposal would have gaining support in NSW. "The rivers of Northern NSW are subject to a number of legislative and policy requirements that would need to be addressed in a more detailed assessment," it warns.

Ian Tiley, mayor of the &lt;a href="w%3AClarence%20Valley%20Council"&gt;Clarence Valley Council&lt;/a&gt; warns that any plan to dam the Clarence River would meet with stiff resistance from local residents. "If there's one issue that unites the vast majority of the Clarence people, it's the mighty Clarence River," he warned.

"And the council, and I believe the vast majority of people in this valley, are totally opposed to (the plan).

"We'll stand shoulder to shoulder and fight with the Clarence citizens."

NSW &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;Nationals&lt;/a&gt; MP for &lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Clarence"&gt;Clarence&lt;/a&gt; Steve Cansdell said he believes the water minister should "get in a kayak and go up the Clarence ... and just have a look and see the pristine nature of this and the delicate nature of our water system".

<h1>Plants on other planets may not be green</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Plants%20on%20other%20planets%20may%20not%20be%20green&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
On Wednesday, &lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; scientists said that, unlike &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20%28color%29"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt; plants on the planet &lt;a href="w%3AEarth"&gt;Earth&lt;/a&gt;, plants on other planets may be the color &lt;a href="w%3ARed%20%28color%29"&gt;red&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3AYellow%20%28color%29"&gt;yellow&lt;/a&gt;.

Plants on Earth are green because they contain &lt;a href="w%3Achlorophyll"&gt;chlorophyll&lt;/a&gt;. The chlorophyll appears green because it absorbs mainly blue and red light in order to produce food for the plant via &lt;a href="w%3Aphotosynthesis"&gt;photosynthesis&lt;/a&gt;, while reflecting the green light frequency.

Scientists at NASA point out that if the stars for other planets were in a different state than our sun and if the light frequency that reached the planets' surface was different, then the plants on those planets would have also evolved a different type of &lt;a href="w%3Aphotosynthetic%20pigment"&gt;photosynthetic pigment&lt;/a&gt; other than chlorophyll. This pigment would be dedicated towards the different light frequencies received by the planet causing the plant to appear a different color from green such as red and yellow.

Carl Pilcher, director of the &lt;a href="w%3ANASA%20Astrobiology%20Institute"&gt;NASA Astrobiology Institute&lt;/a&gt;, said, "This work broadens our understanding of how life may be detected on Earth-like planets around other stars, while simultaneously improving our understanding of life on Earth. This approach--studying Earth life to guide our search for life on other worlds--is the essence of astrobiology."

The research into the color of plants on other planets was started by &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%20Institute%20of%20Technology"&gt;California Institute of Technology&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aastrobiologist"&gt;astrobiologist&lt;/a&gt; Vikki Meadows and a host of other scientists who were studying how light is absorbed and reflected by plants and some bacteria on Earth. Using this data, a computer model was designed to predict the color of plants and bacteria on other planets.

Nancy Kiang, a biometeorologist at NASA’s &lt;a href="w%3AGoddard%20Institute%20for%20Space%20Studies"&gt;Goddard Institute for Space Studies&lt;/a&gt;, noted that it was unlikely any of the plants would be the color &lt;a href="w%3ABlue%20%28color%29"&gt;blue&lt;/a&gt;, "It appears that harvesting blue light is very common across the board for photosynthetic organisms. I think it is unlikely that anything will be blue."

♡❤Senators lead series 1-0. (Best of Seven)♡❤

The young &lt;a href="w%3APittsburgh%20Penguins"&gt;Pittsburgh Penguins&lt;/a&gt; were given their first taste of the &lt;a href="w%3AStanley%20Cup%20Playoffs"&gt;NHL Stanley Cup Playoffs&lt;/a&gt;, Wednesday night. Needless to say, they didn't enjoy it. The &lt;a href="w%3AOttawa%20Senators"&gt;Ottawa Senators&lt;/a&gt; defeated the Penguins 6-3 to take a one game advantage in the best of seven series. The game went from bad to downright nasty, with 20 penalties between the two clubs throughout the game, keeping the officiating crew busy throughout the game.

The experienced Senators exploded out of the gates, taking an early lead just 1:37 into regulation, when &lt;a href="w%3AAndrej%20Meszaros"&gt;Andrej Meszaros&lt;/a&gt; scored the first goal of the series. &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Kelly"&gt;Chris Kelly&lt;/a&gt; would score 5:01 later to double the Sens' lead to two goals. In the second period, &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Preissing"&gt;Tom Preissing&lt;/a&gt; would give Ottawa a 3-0 advantage at 14:38. The Penguins would finally get on the scoresheet 2:20 later, when rookie &lt;a href="w%3AJordan%20Staal"&gt;Jordan Staal&lt;/a&gt; scored his first career playoff goal, to make it a two goal game. &lt;a href="w%3ADany%20Heatley"&gt;Dany Heatley&lt;/a&gt; scored the Senators' second power play goal of the night, just 0:09 into the final period, beating Penguins goaltender &lt;a href="w%3AMarc-Andre%20Fleury"&gt;Marc-Andre Fleury&lt;/a&gt;, who was under siege for most of the night. Ottawa wouldn't let up, scoring two more goals before &lt;a href="w%3ASergei%20Gonchar"&gt;Sergei Gonchar&lt;/a&gt; found the back of the net. Sidney Crosby would tally his first career playoff goal with :49 left in the game, burying the puck behind Ottawa goaltender &lt;a href="w%3ARay%20Emery"&gt;Ray Emery&lt;/a&gt;.

Crosby appeared to have scored earlier in the third period to narrow the score to two goals, when both Crosby and the puck plowed into the net, but the ruling was overturned, leaving Crosby and the Penguins bench shaking their heads in disgust. In the post game press conference, Crosby said that he would have to see the replay before ruling for himself if he had scored or not.

Fights erupted several times throughout the game, and the penalties mounted for each team as the tension grew. The teams entered the game with a mutual dislike for each other, and no doubt left loathing each other. Perhaps the most exciting outcome of the game is the anticipation for the next game of the series. The Penguins and Senators face each other again, Saturday afternoon, in the best of seven series.

♡❤Sharks lead series 1-0. (Best of Seven)♡❤

<h2>Game Recap</h2>
The &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Jose%20Sharks"&gt;San Jose Sharks&lt;/a&gt; defeated the &lt;a href="w%3ANashville%20Predators"&gt;Nashville Predators&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday night, taking a 1-0 series lead in the 2007 &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Hockey%20League"&gt;NHL&lt;/a&gt; Playoffs. It was the Sharks second victory over the Predators this season in five meetings between the two teams. It was a tough defeat for the Predators to swallow, giving up the deciding goal with 8:14 left in the second overtime.

After the Sharks took a 4-2 lead in the middle of the second period, &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Radulov"&gt;Alexander Radulov&lt;/a&gt; scored his second goal of the game in the third period with 7:55 remaining in regulation. With about a minute to go, and a one goal lead, the Sharks' &lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Rissmiller"&gt;Patrick Rissmiller&lt;/a&gt; gave up the puck twice leading to a &lt;a href="w%3AJean-Pierre%20Dumont"&gt;J.P. Dumont&lt;/a&gt; goal. Dumont's second goal of the game came with :51 remaining in regulation to knot it up at four goals apiece.

Neither team managed to score in the first overtime, although the Nashville Predators dominated with a noticeably large number of shots. The Predators continued to pile on the shots at the Sharks' &lt;a href="w%3AEvgeni%20Nabokov"&gt;Evgeni Nabokov&lt;/a&gt; in the second overtime period. The final score came from Patrick Rissmiller, who buried one behind &lt;a href="w%3ATom%C3%A1%C5%A1%20Vokoun"&gt;Tomas Vokoun&lt;/a&gt;, forgiving his missteps which led to the late Nashville goal. The goal lifted the Sharks to the 5-4 victory and a 1-0 series lead.

Evgeni Nabokov picked up the win for the Sharks, stopping 39 of 43 shots faced, allowing four goals while Nashville's Tomas Vokoun stopped 33 of 38 faced shots, and was saddled with the loss.

The Sharks have now won five straight playoff games against the Predators, dating back to their Western Conference Quarterfinal series in the 2006 Stanley Cup Playoffs. This was also the Sharks' first overtime victory in the playoffs since beating &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Louis%20Blues%20%28hockey%29"&gt;St. Louis&lt;/a&gt; in the first round of the 2000 Stanley Cup Playoffs.

The series is just getting started, and the Sharks will face the Predators again on Friday at 8:00 PM (CDT), when Nashville will try to even the best of seven series at home in &lt;a href="w%3ANashville%20Arena"&gt;Nashville Arena&lt;/a&gt; before the teams head to &lt;a href="w%3AHP%20Pavilion"&gt;HP Pavilion&lt;/a&gt; in San Jose, Calif.

♡❤Canucks lead series 1-0. (Best of Seven)♡❤

The &lt;a href="w%3AVancouver%20Canucks"&gt;Vancouver Canucks&lt;/a&gt; came out on top after the sixth longest game in &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Hockey%20League"&gt;NHL&lt;/a&gt; Playoff history. The final goal came after a scoring opportunity that was able to find the back of the net, finally, after &lt;a href="w%3ADallas%20Stars"&gt;Dallas Stars&lt;/a&gt; goaltender &lt;a href="w%3AMarty%20Turco"&gt;Marty Turco&lt;/a&gt; kept the net empty for over 90 minutes. &lt;a href="w%3AHenrik%20Sedin"&gt;Henrik Sedin&lt;/a&gt; connected on a pass from brother, &lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Sedin"&gt;Daniel Sedin&lt;/a&gt;, which unleashed a celebration from the remaining crowd at &lt;a href="w%3AGeneral%20Motors%20Place"&gt;General Motors Place&lt;/a&gt; in Vancouver.

Vancouver's goalie, &lt;a href="w%3ARoberto%20Luongo"&gt;Roberto Luongo&lt;/a&gt; had a very successful performance as he stopped a total of 72 shots to keep the Canucks in the game for as long as it lasted. On the other hand, the Stars' Turco performed fairly well, fending off 48 shots, but will likely fall to criticism as he has been unable, at least in previous seasons, to continue his all star season performances with playoff success.

The game was the longest ever in Vancouver Canucks' history.

Vancouver looks to extend its 1-0 series lead over the Dallas Stars after the first game as they continue the series in Vancouver on Friday at 6:00pm (PDT). Vancouver eventually won the series 4-3.

A United Nations exhibition, entitled "Lessons from Rwanda", about the 1994 &lt;a href="w%3ARwandan%20Genocide"&gt;Rwanda genocide&lt;/a&gt;, has been dismantled and postponed because &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt; raised objections to the &lt;a href="w%3AArmenian%20Genocide"&gt;Armenian genocide&lt;/a&gt; being mentioned.

The Armenian genocide was carried out by the so called &lt;a href="w%3ASpecial%20Organization%20%28Ottoman%20Empire%29"&gt;Special Organization&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AYoung%20Turks"&gt;Young Turks&lt;/a&gt;, who specially elected criminals from Turkish prisons to act as escorts in the deportation of Armenians. The Armenian genocide is the second most studied case of genocide after the &lt;a href="w%3AHolocaust"&gt;Holocaust&lt;/a&gt; Hitler himself occasionally referred to the extermination of the Armenians, or the lack of prosecution there of, in support for his plan to exterminate the Jews.

However, the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20of%20Turkey"&gt;Republic of Turkey&lt;/a&gt; has long disputed that the event constituted &lt;a href="w%3Agenocide"&gt;genocide&lt;/a&gt;, claiming rather that the Armenian deaths were a result of inter-ethnic strife, disease and famine during the turmoil of &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20War%20I"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;.

The exhibit was set up in the visitors lobby on Thursday and was due to be opened on Monday by U.N. Secretary-General &lt;a href="w%3ABan%20Ki-moon"&gt;Ban Ki-moon&lt;/a&gt;. "Lessons from Rwanda" was created by &lt;a href="w%3AAegis%20Trust"&gt;Aegis Trust&lt;/a&gt;, an anti-genocide &lt;a href="w%3ANGO"&gt;NGO&lt;/a&gt;, and approved by the U.N. Department of Public Information. The Holocaust, Cambodia, &lt;a href="w%3ASrebrenica%20massacre"&gt;Bosnia&lt;/a&gt;, East Timor and &lt;a href="w%3ADarfur%20conflict"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt; were mentioned as examples of genocide. But it also included a section entitled “What is genocide?” which read:

On Saturday, James Smith, the chief executive of Aegis, was told by the UN to remove the sentence. Aegis would not submit to the Secretary General’s request. Smith explains, "Had we been asked to remove reference of atrocities to Jews because Germany objected, we would have been equally resistant."

The suggestion by Armen Martirosyan, the Armenian ambassador to the UN, to remove the words "in Turkey" were also not acceptable. Baki Ilkin, the Turkish ambassador to the UN, said that Turkey expressed "discomfort over the text's making references to the Armenian issue and drawing parallels with the genocide in Rwanda."

On Monday, the panels in the visitor's lobby had been turned around to prevent it being seen by the public. Farhan Haq, U.N. associate spokesman, said that the review process which takes into account "all positions" had not been followed and that "the exhibition has been postponed until the regular review process is completed." Manoel de Almeida e Silva, an official in the strategic communications division, said the exhibit would take place. "We are committed to it. It is a very important issue."

Eight people, including two members of the &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;i &lt;a href="w%3AIraqi%20Council%20of%20Representatives"&gt;Council of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; were killed in a bomb explosion at a cafe inside the parliamentary building in Baghdad during lunchtime.
Approximately 20 people are reported wounded in the attack inside the heavily fortified &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Zone"&gt;Green Zone&lt;/a&gt;. According to a BBC report, the cafe where the bomb was detonated was frequented by Iraqi MPs. The parliament had closed for lunch only ten minutes earlier and the cafe was at the start of a busy period. 

In order for the bomber to reach his target, he would have had to pass through several armed checkpoints, leading to suspicions that the bomb was smuggled in separately. However, according to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ (AP) reports, a scanner used to check pedestrians at the Green Zone entrance near the Council of Representatives was not operational. People were searched by hand or went through metal detectors, and dogs were used to check people entering the building earlier in the day, a rare occurrence, AP said. It is suspected that a bodyguard of one of the lawmakers smuggled in the bomb. 

The attack follows an attack on a major bridge across the River Tigris, which was damaged with a truck bomb. 

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; military spokesperson Major-General William Caldwell said the blast bore the hallmarks of Sunni Islamist al Qaeda, which has been resurgent in recent weeks despite &lt;a href="w%3AOperation%20Law%20and%20Order"&gt;Operation Law and Order&lt;/a&gt;.

♡❤Ducks lead series 1-0. (Best of Seven)♡❤

Dustin Penner scored the game winning goal with 5:20 remaining in regulation, and the Anaheim Ducks defeated the Minnesota Wild 2-1, Wednesday night. The Ducks took a 1-0 lead in the best-of-seven game series, thanks in part to Penner's goal. 

After a scoreless first period highlighted by good defensive play from both teams, Pavol Demitra scored the game's first goal in the second, beating Anaheim goaltender Ilya Bryzgalov to give Minnesota a 1-0 lead. 3:51 later, Teemu Selanne scored on a breakaway, knotting the score up at 1-1. 

With the score tied in the third, the Ducks picked up a rebound off a shot by the Wild. Quickly, the Ducks mounted a counter-attack, passing the puck up to Penner. Penner shot from the left side of the net, but the puck was stopped by Minnesota goaltender Nicklas Backstrom. However, the puck would richochet off of the pad of Backstrom, allowing Penner to shove the puck into the net, sealing the Ducks win. Commenting on his score after the game in the post game press conference, Penner said: "If the puck didn't go in after the initial shot I wanted to be able to pick up any loose change." And that was exactly what he did.

&lt;a href="England"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur"&gt;Tottenham Hotspur&lt;/a&gt; dropped out of the &lt;a href="UEFA%20Cup"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt; after a 2-2 draw at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20Hart%20Lane"&gt;White Hart Lane&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; against &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASevilla%20FC"&gt;Sevilla&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Spurs lost the first game 2-1 in Spain, and the tie was enough to see Sevilla through 4-3 on aggregate.

Sevilla had a 2-0 lead after just eight minutes in &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASteed%20Malbranque"&gt;Steed Malbranque&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; scored an own goal after 3 minutes as he attempted to clear the ball off the line. The ball scuffed off the bottom of his boot and bobbled into the net. Former Tottenham player &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFreddie%20Kanoute"&gt;Freddie Kanoute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; then doubled the visitors lead only minutes later after he collected the ball, played a one two, and danced around keeper &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Robinson"&gt;Paul Robinson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Before the end of the first half, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADimitar%20Berbatov"&gt;Dimitar Berbatov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; struck the post off a hammered shot, but the score remained 2-0.

Tottenham struck back in the second half and substitute &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJermain%20Defoe"&gt;Jermain Defoe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; scored minutes after coming on to cut Sevilla's lead. Just a minute later, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAaron%20Lennon"&gt;Aaron Lennon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; tied the game, putting pressure on Sevilla. Two more chances emerged for Tottenham, one through defender &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Dawson"&gt;Michael Dawson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and Dimitar Berbatov, but neither where able to convert. With only stoppage time remaining, and Spurs in need of two goals to advance, frustration played out as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATeemu%20Tainio"&gt;Teemu Tainio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was red carded for a dangerous challenge on Puerta.

Sevilla was one of three Spanish sides to advance to the semi-finals Thursday, and they will face Osasuna in the next round, guaranteeing there will be a Spanish club in the final. Tottenham have only the Premiership left to contend for now, as they look to book a European spot for next season against Wigan Athletic on the 15th.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACBS%20Radio"&gt;CBS Radio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a subsidiary of &lt;a href="CBS"&gt;CBS&lt;/a&gt;, fired &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADon%20Imus"&gt;Don Imus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Thursday amidst controversy over comments made on the air last week about the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARutgers%20University"&gt;Rutgers University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Awomen%27s%20basketball"&gt;women's basketball&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; team.

Last week Imus called the team "nappy-headed hos" during one of his radio show broadcasts.

The CBS decision came one day after &lt;a href="NBC"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANBC%20News"&gt;News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; pulled the plug on the Imus Show's simulcast on &lt;a href="MSNBC"&gt;MSNBC&lt;/a&gt; as a result of the remarks. A handful of advertisers withdrew their support of the Imus Show prior to both network's decisions. 

"There has been much discussion of the effect language like this has on our young people, particularly young women of color trying to make their way in this society. That consideration has weighed most heavily on our minds as we made our decision," said Leslie Moonves, the executive producer for CBS.

Imus does not hold the firing against CBS saying "I understand the pressure they were under. I said it. I wouldn't be here if I didn't say it."

<h3>Continental passenger jet almost shot down</h3>

A &lt;a href="w%3AContinental%20Airlines"&gt;Continental Airlines&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20777"&gt;Boeing 777&lt;/a&gt; was in danger of being shot down Wednesday, during a &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3ATel%20Aviv"&gt;Tel Aviv&lt;/a&gt; commercial flight. The pilot of the 777 failed to make contact when approaching the &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;i coast, and authorities were afraid the airliner had been taken over by hijackers. Two Israeli &lt;a href="w%3AF-15%20Eagle"&gt;F-15&lt;/a&gt;s and two &lt;a href="w%3AF-16%20Fighting%20Falcon"&gt;F-16&lt;/a&gt;s were scrambled to intercept. While the plane was still over the Mediterranean, the captain realised the situation and immediately made contact. The Continental airliner was then escorted to Tel Aviv airport by the fighter jets without incident. Upon landing at Tel Aviv's &lt;a href="w%3ABen%20Gurion%20International%20Airport"&gt;Ben Gurion International Airport&lt;/a&gt;, an inquiry into the incident was opened by officials.

<h3>Pakistani army involved in NWFP battles</h3>

For the first time &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20Pakistan"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Pervez%20Musharraf"&gt;Pervez Musharraf&lt;/a&gt; has admitted the &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;i army has been helping tribal fighters in the &lt;a href="w%3ANorth-West%20Frontier%20Province"&gt;NWFP&lt;/a&gt; battling foreign militants. Media has in recent days reported on battles between local tribes and &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATaliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt; fighters, primarily of &lt;a href="w%3AUzbekistan"&gt;Uzbek&lt;/a&gt; origin.

"The people of South Waziristan now have risen against the foreigners," Musharraf told a conference of defense officials in &lt;a href="w%3AIslamabad"&gt;Islamabad&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday. "They have killed about 300 of them. They have support from the Pakistan army. They asked for it."

<h3>Katie Couric unaware of plagiarism</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3ACBS"&gt;CBS&lt;/a&gt; has admitted that the April 4 installment of "Katie Couric's Notebook" was plagiarized. It seems it consisted mainly of passages lifted verbatim from a &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Wall%20Street%20Journal"&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt; column by Jeffrey Zaslow which was published in March.

Although, attributed to - and read by - &lt;a href="w%3AKatie%20Couric"&gt;Katie Couric&lt;/a&gt;, in the video essay "Katie Couric's Notebook," it has been revealed that she did not write them and that they were supplied for her by CBS producers. Couric, herself, has not commented.

On Wednesday, Canadian &lt;a href="w%3ABlackBerry"&gt;BlackBerry&lt;/a&gt; maker &lt;a href="w%3AResearch%20In%20Motion"&gt;Research In Motion Limited&lt;/a&gt; (RIM), reported preliminary fourth quarter and year-end financial results. Despite record profits, up from US$18 million in the same quarter last year to $188 million for the current quarter, the news was dampened by the revelation that the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Securities%20and%20Exchange%20Commission"&gt;US Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt; (SEC) had formalized its investigation into RIM's accounting practices.

An internal review by RIM, initiated eight months ago, revealed irregularities with how the company accounted for stock options. On March 5 of 2007, RIM co-chief executive and chairman, &lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Balsillie"&gt;Jim Balsillie&lt;/a&gt;, resigned his position of chairman, due to the irregularities.

RIM had indicated, until recently, that the SEC probe into the company's stock option granting practices was an informal inquiry. In a press release April 11, RIM suggested that "the informal inquiry has been converted to a formal investigation."

In its press release, RIM indicated it would restate financials for the second and third quarters of fiscal 2007, and the fiscal year ended March 3, 2007 only. Through its internal probe, RIM had determined that the accounting irregularities for recently filed Canadian &lt;a href="w%3AGaap"&gt;Generally Accepted Accounting Principles&lt;/a&gt; (GAAP) statements would not result in a material adjustment. It would not, therefore, restate Canadian GAAP financial statements, filed previously. 

Aside from the record profits just reported, RIM indicated that it had shipped approximately 6.4 million BlackBerry devices in fiscal 2007 and that 1.02 million subscriber accounts were added in the fourth quarter. At the end of the quarter, the total BlackBerry subscriber account base had increased to 8 million.

On the news of the formal SEC inquiry, RIM's stock price was down over 8%, Thursday, on the &lt;a href="w%3ANASDAQ"&gt;NASDAQ&lt;/a&gt;.

♡❤Red Wings lead series 1-0. (Best of Seven)♡❤

Calgary never knew what hit them Thursday night, as the Detroit Red Wings, which came into the playoffs as the first seed in the West, cruised to victory. By 8:36 in the first period, the Red Wings had opened up a 2-0 lead on the Flames, with &lt;a href="w%3AValtteri%20Filppula"&gt;Valtteri Filppula&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANicklas%20Lidstr%C3%B6m"&gt;Nicklas Lidstrom&lt;/a&gt; scoring on Calgary netminder &lt;a href="w%3AMiikka%20Kiprusoff"&gt;Miikka Kiprusoff&lt;/a&gt;, who was bombarded by shots the entire game. &lt;a href="w%3ADominik%20Ha%C5%A1ek"&gt;Dominik Hasek&lt;/a&gt; was spectacular in goal, as he has been so many times this season, stopping 19 of 20 shots faced. Calgary's only consolation came at 14:55 in the third, when &lt;a href="w%3AAlex%20Tanguay"&gt;Alex Tanguay&lt;/a&gt; scored a power play goal.

Despite the Red Wings victory, the Flames will have a chance to tie up the series, which is just getting started, when they will do battle again against Detroit on Sunday. Opening face off is scheduled for 1:00 EDT.

&lt;a href="w%3ANintendo"&gt;Nintendo of America Inc.&lt;/a&gt; (Nintendo) announced on Thursday the release of a full version of the &lt;a href="w%3AWii"&gt;Wii&lt;/a&gt; gaming system's &lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20Channel"&gt;Internet Channel&lt;/a&gt;. Powered by a customized &lt;a href="w%3AOpera%20%28Internet%20suite%29"&gt;Opera&lt;/a&gt; Internet browser, the service will allow gamers with high-speed connections to surf the Internet on their television.

According to the Nintendo news release, the Channel's final version is available as a free download until June 30, after which it will cost 500 &lt;a href="w%3AWii%20Points"&gt;Wii Points&lt;/a&gt;, or approximately five US dollars. Once downloaded, the Internet Channel would be free for the lifetime of the system.

The Opera browser had been available in a beta format with limitations on the functionality. The final version boasts improvements such as a manual zoom, improved scrolling, as well as collapsible toolbars and multiple on-screen cursors. In addition, users are given the choice of presetting either &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3AYahoo%21"&gt;Yahoo!&lt;/a&gt; as a search engine to power the built-in search button.

Some enthusiasts have complained that using the Wii's controllers rather than a keyboard to enter text, can be awkward. "Opening the address bar does not open it with the current URL. That would have been nice." wrote &lt;a href="w%3ASlashdot"&gt;Slashdot&lt;/a&gt; member LBt1st. "It would also be nice if it would make plain text URL's into links. Manual entry is hell without a keyboard."

Others lamented the lack of availability of the Wii system in stores and were concerned that the free download offer might expire before being able to obtain a system. "Great! Now all I need is a Wii! Still searching for one in Toronto," complained Slashdot member, CokeBear.

The full version of the Internet Channel, with the Opera browser, is available for download in North America only at this stage.

♡❤Rangers lead series 1-0. (Best of Seven)♡❤

The New York Rangers scored the first two goals and never looked back, defeating the Thrashers before 18,857 at &lt;a href="w%3APhilips%20Arena"&gt;Philips Arena&lt;/a&gt; in Atlanta, Georgia. The game was the first in the best-of-seven series. Never since their inception into the NHL in 1997, have the Thrashers advanced to the playoffs until this season, and will have to wait for their first ever playoff victory. Despite a desperate last minute power play, Atlanta couldn't manage to beat Rangers goaltender &lt;a href="w%3AHenrik%20Lundqvist"&gt;Henrik Lundqvist&lt;/a&gt;, who has shined this season. Lundqvist was solid again tonight, stopping 21 of 24 shots faced. 

&lt;a href="w%3APascal%20Dupuis"&gt;Pascal Dupuis&lt;/a&gt; of the Atlanta Thrashers was sent into the boards in the first period, and had to come off the ice for some time before returning to score the game's final goal. &lt;a href="w%3AKari%20Lehtonen"&gt;Kari Lehtonen&lt;/a&gt;, goaltender for the Thrashers entered the game with a 2.79 goals-against average. Lehtonen allowed four goals, while stopping 34 shots.

♡❤Sabres lead series 1-0. (Best of Seven)♡❤

&lt;a href="w%3ABrian%20Campbell"&gt;Brian Campbell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Drury"&gt;Chris Drury&lt;/a&gt; scored two goals each, and the top-seeded Sabres opened the playoffs with an solid 4-1 victory over the New York Islanders before 18,690 at &lt;a href="w%3AHSBC%20Arena"&gt;HSBC Arena&lt;/a&gt;, in Buffalo, New York. Buffalo goaltender &lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Miller%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;Ryan Miller&lt;/a&gt; was very efficient, allowing only one goal in 21 shots. The Islanders backup netminder &lt;a href="w%3AWade%20Dubielewicz"&gt;Wade Dubielewicz&lt;/a&gt; filled in for starter &lt;a href="w%3ARick%20DiPietro"&gt;Rick DiPietro&lt;/a&gt;, who has been bothered by injuries throughout the season.

The game was very defensive for the first half of the game, as both teams were only able to notch a goal a piece. Buffalo scored its first goal 9:30 into regulation, and the Islanders had to wait until 6:58 of the second period, when they evened it up. But the game was pretty much a full onslaught of domination by Buffalo as it dominated the shots category.

The Sabres scored the game-winner shortly after the midway point of the second period, and dealt another quick blow immediately after they returned to the ice for the third period. The Islanders, no doubt, have their problems to work with in terms of injuries, and the frustration could be felt as they drew a penalty late, which would ultimately seal the deal as Brian Campbell would score his second goal with only 3:25 remaining in regulation.

The Eastern Conference series continues at HSBC Arena in Buffalo on Saturday at 7:30 pm EDT, when the Sabres will try to take a 2-0 series lead on the Islanders.

The second leg of the UEFA Cup quarter-final's occurred Thursday, with three Spanish teams looking to progress to the semi-finals. Osasuna was in the best position to advance after their 3-0 victory over Bayer Leverkusen in the first leg in Germany. Sevilla and Espanyol also held the upper hand going into their matches, as Sevilla defeated Tottenham 2-1 and Espanyol beat out Benfica 3-2 in the first legs. The final match was still completely up in the air after the 0-0 draw in the first leg between Werder Bremen and AZ Alkmaar.

<h2>Matches</h2>
<h4>Tottenham Hotspur 2 - 2 Sevilla</h4>
After loosing the first leg 2-1 in Spain, the second leg moved to White Hart Lane in London. Sevilla put the homeside on the backfoot early however, with a Steed Malbranque own-goal giving the visitors the lead. Some good play by former Tottenham striker Freddie Kanoute then doubled Sevilla's lead. Tottenham would score twice through Defoe and Lennon, but it would be too little too late as Sevilla progressed 4-3 on aggregate.

For a full recap of the match see: 

<h4>Werder Bremen 4 - 1 AZ Alkmaar</h4>
After a scintillating 0-0 draw in the first leg, Dutch side AZ Alkmaar travelled to Germany to take on Bundesliga title hopefuls Werder Bremen. With Bremen having scored only one goal in their past three games, Alkmaar was in with a chance as a draw would see them advance. Bremen took control of the game quickly, however, and Tim Borowski put the home side up after sixteen minutes when he slipped in all alone and slid the ball past Boy Waterman. On 32 minutes, Alkmaar equalized through Moussa Dembele as his unstopable left footed shot flew past Tim Wiese. Five minutes later, Miroslav Klose restored Bremens lead as he tapped home Aaron Hunt's cross. The home side increased their lead after the break, and their top goal scorer Klose was again on the scoresheet. A well put in cross by Diego found Klose in the middle of the box, and his controlled diving head was powered past the helpless Waterman. Diego then secured the win for Bremen with some wonderful individual play. As Diego played a one-two, he spun away from the defender leaving him wide open for the receive pass, and he then proceeded to finish cleanly past Waterman.

<h4>Osasuna 1 - 0 Bayer Leverkusen</h4>
With the end result of the two legs never in doubt after the 3-0 drubbing of Bayer in the first leg, the second leg was play out at the Estadio Reyno de Navarra in Spain. Bayer needed to score early for any hope of advancing, and they pushed hard. A solid Osasuna defence and some great goalkeeping by Ricardo combined to shut Leverkusen out though. Osasuna eventually scored in the 62nd minute through Gomez Juanlu after keeper Rene Adler parried Roberto Solado's long range effort. Osasuna comfortably held on, and advanced to the semi-finals of the competition.

<h4>Benfica 0 - 0 Espanyol</h4>
Benfica and Espanyol battled to a 0-0 draw at the Estadio de Luz in Portugal. The Spanish side went into the match with a slight edge after winning the first leg 3-2, but the two away goals for Benfica gave them a good chance to progress. Benfica battled hard for the win, hitting the woodwork twice and missing several clean chances, but the eventual draw saw them knocked out of the competition.

The New Jersey Devils got their ride in the 2007 NHL Stanley Cup Playoffs started off right Thursday night, defeating the high-voltage offense of the Tampa Bay Lightning before 14,495 at &lt;a href="w%3AContinental%20Airlines%20Arena"&gt;Continental Airlines Arena&lt;/a&gt;, in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

&lt;a href="w%3AZach%20Parise"&gt;Zach Parise&lt;/a&gt;, the Devils 1st pick (17th overall) in the 2003 draft, who led the team in scoring this season with 31 goals, scored twice in the game, including the winning goal off a pass from &lt;a href="w%3AJamie%20Langenbrunner"&gt;Jamie Langenbrunner&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AVincent%20Lecavalier"&gt;Vinny Lecavalier&lt;/a&gt; scored twice for the Lightning, but his efforts alone were not enough for Tampa. &lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20Brodeur"&gt;Martin Brodeur&lt;/a&gt; was solid as always in net for the Devils, notching 23 saves to pick up the win.

Tampa and Jersey will face each other at least three more times in the Opening Round of the NHL Playoffs. The next meeting between the two clubs will be Saturday at 7:00 pm EDT, when the teams will meet again at Continental Airlines Arena.

The Governor of &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Jersey"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJon%20S.%20Corzine"&gt;Jon S. Corzine&lt;/a&gt; was hospitalized Thursday after the vehicle he was riding in crashed into a guardrail on &lt;a href="w%3AGarden%20State%20Parkway"&gt;Garden State Parkway&lt;/a&gt;. The Governor was on his way to a meeting between the &lt;a href="w%3ARutgers%20University"&gt;Rutgers University&lt;/a&gt; basketball team and radio personality &lt;a href="w%3ADon%20Imus"&gt;Don Imus&lt;/a&gt;.

Corzine was riding in the front passenger seat when a red pickup truck drifted onto the shoulder. As the truck corrected itself, a white pickup swerved to avoid it, hitting the motorcade SUV he was riding. Corzine suffered six broken ribs, a broken collarbone, broken sternum, fracture of his lower vertebrae, a broken leg, and a head gash. He is in stable condition following surgery at &lt;a href="w%3ACooper%20University%20Hospital"&gt;Cooper University Hospital&lt;/a&gt;, but will require more surgery to repair a broken femur that broke through the skin. The trooper driving the vehicle suffered minor injuries.

Senate President &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Codey"&gt;Richard Codey&lt;/a&gt; will serve as governor while Corzine is in the hospital. An aide to Corzine said he was not wearing a seat belt.

<h3>"No" to HIV migrants says Australian PM</h3>

HIV positive migrants or refugees should be blocked from
entering Australia according to statements
made by Australian Prime Minister Howard.

In a radio interview in Melbourne, Mr. Howard was apparently quoted as stating,
"My initial reaction is no," he said. "There may be some humanitarian considerations that could temper that in certain cases, but, prime facie - no," Howard said in relation to the issue.

An angry reaction has come from charities involved with AIDS. Dr. Chris Lemoh, a specialist in infectious disease was quoted as as saying, "a hysterical overreaction, it mixes racism with a phobia about infectious disease"

The &lt;a href="w%3ACleveland%20Indians"&gt;Cleveland Indians&lt;/a&gt; pulled off a stunning win late in the game at &lt;a href="w%3AMiller%20Park"&gt;Miller Park&lt;/a&gt; in Milwaukee, Thursday, defeating the &lt;a href="w%3AAnaheim%20Angels"&gt;Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3ATravis%20Hafner"&gt;Travis Hafner&lt;/a&gt;, in the bottom of the eighth, hit a three run homer to erase the one score lead of the &lt;a href="w%3AAngels"&gt;Angels&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AOrlando%20Cabrera"&gt;Orlando Cabrera&lt;/a&gt; was the only angel for the Angels as he had three hits on four at bats with two runs scored.

Pitching for &lt;a href="w%3ACleveland"&gt;Cleveland&lt;/a&gt; was pretty solid as &lt;a href="w%3AJeremy%20Sowers"&gt;Jeremy Sowers&lt;/a&gt; pitched seven innings, with one run on six hits with 27 at bats, one error, and three strikeouts. No home runs were give up by any of the four pitchers(&lt;a href="w%3AJeremy%20Sowers"&gt;Jeremy Sowers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARoberto%20Hernandez"&gt;Roberto Hernandez&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAaron%20Fultz"&gt;Aaron Fultz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Borowski"&gt;Joe Borowski&lt;/a&gt;) for &lt;a href="w%3ACleveland"&gt;Cleveland&lt;/a&gt;.

The same couldn't be said for the &lt;a href="w%3AAngels"&gt;Angels&lt;/a&gt; pitchers squad, though. &lt;a href="w%3ADustin%20Moseley"&gt;Dustin Moseley&lt;/a&gt; started for the &lt;a href="w%3ALA%20Angels"&gt;LA Angels&lt;/a&gt; pitching six innings, allowing one run on five hits with 24 at bats, one error, three strikeouts, and one home run given up. It was not &lt;a href="w%3ADustin%20Moseley"&gt;Dustin Moseley&lt;/a&gt; who gave up the game winning three run homer, but &lt;a href="w%3AScot%20Shields"&gt;Scot Shields&lt;/a&gt;, the relief pitcher who let the game slide.

&lt;a href="w%3AAaron%20Fultz"&gt;Aaron Fultz&lt;/a&gt; was the winning pitcher for the game, his second win of the young season. &lt;a href="w%3AScot%20Shields"&gt;Scot Shields&lt;/a&gt; was saddled with his first loss of the season. The save was credited to closer &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Borowski"&gt;Joe Borowski&lt;/a&gt;. 

The game was played in Milwaukee due to the snow storm in Cleveland the previous weekend.

Cleveland's next game will be a home game (this time in Cleveland) against the &lt;a href="w%3AChicago%20White%20Sox"&gt;Chicago White Sox&lt;/a&gt; at 7:05 tonight, the first of a three game series. As the Angels well face the &lt;a href="w%3ABoston%20Red%20Sox"&gt;Boston Red Sox&lt;/a&gt; at 4:05 tonight, the first of a four game series.

Australia are now assured of a place in the semi-finals of the World Cup, the first team to achieve as such in this year's competition, having bowled Ireland out in just 3 hours, and swiftly hit the 92 required in under an hour: finishing the match before the lunch break.

&lt;a href="w%3ACristiano%20Ronaldo"&gt;Cristiano Ronaldo&lt;/a&gt; has signed a new five-year deal with &lt;a href="Manchester%20United"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt;. He will now stay in the club until at least 2012. 

Spanish clubs &lt;a href="w%3AFC%20Barcelona"&gt;FC Barcelona&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Real%20Madrid"&gt;Real Madrid&lt;/a&gt; have been showing interest in the Portuguese midfielder for months, and the deal is sure to quiet transfer rumours for the time being.

Sir Alex Ferguson said to Manchester United's website that it is fantastic news. He also said that Ronaldo has a good relationship with the club, the staff and the fans. 

Ronaldo says that he is happy in club and he wants to win more trophies with them.

Christiano has scored twenty goals for United so far this season, and has added five for Portugal in Euro 2008 qualifiers. He is a candidate for the PFA and the Ballon d'Or (European Footballer of the Year), and is hoping to lead United to three trophies this season.

Both Stéphane Dion and Elizabeth May held a joint news conference today in Central Nova to talk about their plans.

The riding has a long history of Conservative MPs which finds it a tough race to fight for May with the Liberals backing her.

The decision earned some criticism from &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Democrat%20Party"&gt;NDP&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href="w%3AJack%20Layton"&gt;Jack Layton&lt;/a&gt;. "It's incredible that this matter of such importance is being decided by two leaders in secret," Layton told reporters. "That's not what democracy is about. It is the citizens that ought to make choices about who is going to be representing them..."I'm surprised to see Ms. May support the member of Parliament [Stéphane Dion] who was at the Liberal cabinet table during the decade that greenhouse gases went up by more than 30 per cent."

Stéphane Dion held the &lt;a href="w%3AMinister%20of%20Environment"&gt;Minister of Environment&lt;/a&gt; portfolio under former Liberal Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Martin"&gt;Paul Martin&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of his Liberal leadership campaign he changed his campaign colour to green to represent his interest for environmental issues in Canada. May is an environmentalist and is largely noted as founder of the &lt;a href="w%3ASierra%20Club%20of%20Canada"&gt;Sierra Club of Canada&lt;/a&gt;.

The Green Party of Canada has run a full slate of candidates in the last two elections, but has yet to win a seat in Parliament. If May wins the riding in the next federal election, she would be the first one ever.

&lt;a href="Google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; has announced its intention of taking over the &lt;a href="Internet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt; advertising agency &lt;a href="w%3ADoubleClick"&gt;DoubleClick&lt;/a&gt; in a deal worth $3.1 billion. DoubleClick has also confirmed the deal and hopes it will be completed before the end of 2007.

Rumours of a takeover offer for DoubleClick had been circulating, with &lt;a href="Microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATime%20Warner"&gt;Time Warner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AYahoo%21"&gt;Yahoo!&lt;/a&gt; all reportedly interested in making an offer for the company.

Six months ago, Google bought YouTube for $1.65 billion. The current takeover is the largest in Google's history. In a press release, Google says the acquisition "will enable Google to extend our ad network and develop deeper relationships with our partners. This new partnership represents a tremendous opportunity for us at Google to broaden and deepen our inventory of available ads and to better serve both our publishers and users."

DoubleClick provides software for Internet advertising and brings together advertisers, advertisement agencies and website developers. DoubleClick is currently owned by the majority share-holders Hellman &amp; Friedman, a private equity firm, with JMI Management also having a large stake in the company.

Canada has contributed a significant component to &lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APhoenix%20%28spacecraft%29"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/a&gt; mission to &lt;a href="w%3AMars"&gt;Mars&lt;/a&gt;, announced &lt;a href="w%3AMaxime%20Bernier"&gt;Maxime Bernier&lt;/a&gt;, Canada's Minister of Industry. In a news release on Thursday, Bernier, who is also responsible for the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Space%20Agency"&gt;Canadian Space Agency&lt;/a&gt; (CSA), indicated that Canada had provided a meteorological station, named MET.

The Phoenix Lander, with several on-board instruments, is to launch in August 2007 and touch down on Mars in May 2008. It will gather information on the Martian climate and weather, and will search for habitable zones.

The MET is to play a significant role in NASA's mission by providing information on the Mars atmosphere. The MET is comprised of a pressure sensor, three temperature sensors located on a mast, and a &lt;a href="w%3ALIDAR"&gt;lidar&lt;/a&gt;. A lidar is similar to radar but employs laser light rather than microwaves.

The MET instruments were designed by Canadian scientists and private industry, which had received CA$37 million in funding from the CSA. "Our contribution to the Phoenix mission will inspire young Canadians to take their place as part of the next space generation," said Bernier.

Canada has provided astronauts and technology to international space programs. Examples of technological contributions include the &lt;a href="w%3ASRMS"&gt;Canadarm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMobile%20Servicing%20System"&gt;Canadarm2&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle"&gt;Space Shuttle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Space%20Station"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt;.

With the experience gained from the Phoenix mission, NASA hopes to provide a foundation for future robotic missions and, one day, human exploration of Mars.

<h3>Banned rally leads to Kasparov arrest</h3>

Russian opposition leader and former &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Chess%20Championship"&gt;World Chess Champion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGarry%20Kasparov"&gt;Garry Kasparov&lt;/a&gt; was among 170 people detained by Russian authorities during a security operation against a rally organised by &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Other%20Russia"&gt;The Other Russia&lt;/a&gt;. The Other Russia is an umbrella coalition that gathers opponents of Russian President &lt;a href="Vladimir%20Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt;.

"Today the regime showed its true colours, its true face," said Kasparov. "We were arrested when we were doing nothing. There was no action. We were just walking along," he told reporters.

<h3>Nuclear deadline passes for North Korea.</h3>

A key deadline with respect to &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Korea%20and%20weapons%20of%20mass%20destruction"&gt;North Korea's nuclear programme&lt;/a&gt; has passed. &lt;a href="North%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt; said it remained committed to closing the reactor at Yongbyon.

North Korea has insited that some US$25 million be unfrozen at a &lt;a href="Macau"&gt;Macau&lt;/a&gt; bank. The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; says the funds have been released, but that North Korea has yet to withdraw any of it.

US Assistant Secretary of State &lt;a href="w%3AChristopher%20R.%20Hill"&gt;Christopher Hill&lt;/a&gt; was quoted as saying, "It's certainly worrisome to all of us to see them approaching this date rather lethargically." Hill continued, "The Chinese wanted us to show some patience for a couple of more days. There's a sense that the communication lines are open and the North Koreans understand the fact that these accounts are accessible to them."

<h3>UK mental health charity says 'young' need more protection</h3>

&lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; mental health charity, Young Minds, has called on the UK government for mental healthcare reforms to give vulnerable children more protection. The charity also claims that at least a third of young people under psychiatric care are detained against their will.

The charity's comments come in response to the proposed Mental Health Bill which &lt;a href="w%3AParliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom"&gt;Parliament&lt;/a&gt; is set to debat next week.

<h1>NASA: Series of errors led to loss of Mars Global Surveyor</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=NASA%3A%20Series%20of%20errors%20led%20to%20loss%20of%20Mars%20Global%20Surveyor&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
A complex series of events, including a five month-old computer error, was responsible for the battery failure that led to the loss of &lt;a href="NASA"&gt;NASA's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMars%20Global%20Surveyor"&gt;Mars Global Surveyor&lt;/a&gt; last year, an internal review board says. Findings from a preliminary report released on Friday say that while NASA controllers followed procedures while operating the craft, the procedures did not cover the types of errors that occurred.

According to NASA, on November 2, 2006, the Global Surveyor was ordered to perform a routine adjustment of its solar panels. However, the Global Surveyor reoriented to an angle that exposed one of its two batteries to direct sunlight. The battery overheated, which led to the depletion of both batteries. An incorrect setting in antenna orientation prevented Global Surveyor from relaying its status to NASA controllers. Its preprogrammed systems did not take into account the need to maintain a thermally safe orientation.

That was the last communication that NASA controllers had with the spacecraft.

The Global Surveyor was the first US mission to Mars in twenty years, For ten years, the craft returned detailed information to NASA scientists providing new insights, including evidence that appeared to show the presence of water on Mars and identification of deposits of water-related minerals, which led to selection of a Mars rover landing site.

"The loss of the spacecraft was the result of a series of events linked to a computer error made five months before the likely battery failure," said Dolly Perkins, board chairperson and deputy director-technical of NASA's &lt;a href="w%3AGoddard%20Space%20Flight%20Center"&gt;Goddard Space Flight Center&lt;/a&gt;.

The board concluded that NASA controllers had followed procedures, but that the procedures did not adequately cover the type of errors that occurred. In its final report, the board will offer recommendations applicable to future missions.

"We are making an end-to-end review of all our missions to be sure that we apply the lessons learned from Mars Global Surveyor to all our ongoing missions," said Fuk Li, Mars Exploration Program manager at NASA's &lt;a href="w%3AJet%20Propulsion%20Laboratory"&gt;Jet Propulsion Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;.

The Global Surveyor was the longest operating spacecraft at Mars and had lasted four times longer than expected.

&lt;a href="w%3AJune%20Callwood"&gt;June Callwood&lt;/a&gt;, Canadian &lt;a href="w%3AJournalist"&gt;Journalist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Ahumanitarian"&gt;humanitarian&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3Aactivist"&gt;activist&lt;/a&gt;, died today of cancer at age 82.
Callwood, born June 2, 1924 in &lt;a href="w%3AChatham-Kent%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Chatham-Kent, Ontario&lt;/a&gt;, first became a journalist for ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABrantford%20Expositor"&gt;Brantford Expositor&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and later for ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Globe%20and%20Mail"&gt;The Globe and Mail&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, she began doing freelance journalism for magazines including ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMaclean%27s"&gt;Maclean's&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, hosted several television shows for the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACBC%20Television"&gt;CBC&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AVision%20TV"&gt;Vision TV&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, and wrote 30 books. In 2003, she was diagnosed with cancer and refused treatment so she could continue her activism, but just this month the disease began to worsen until her death this morning at &lt;a href="w%3AToronto%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3APrincess%20Margaret%20Hospital"&gt;Princess Margaret Hospital&lt;/a&gt;. Just last month a biography entitled ♡❤June Callwood: A Life of Action♡❤ was written by author Anne Dublin.

Callwood left a significant legacy of activism and community service. She helped to found the Toronto AIDS hospice Casey House, the youth hostel Digger House, Nellie's hostel for women, &lt;a href="w%3APEN%20Canada"&gt;PEN Canada&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Civil%20Liberties%20Foundation"&gt;Canadian Civil Liberties Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. Callwood was also a past spokesperson for the &lt;a href="w%3ACampaign%20Against%20Child%20Poverty"&gt;Campaign Against Child Poverty&lt;/a&gt;.

Casey House (June Callwood) is named after her son, Casey Frayne, who was killed in a motorcycle accident involving a drunk driver, in 1982 at the age of 20.

In 1978, she was made a member of the &lt;a href="w%3AOrder%20of%20Canada"&gt;Order of Canada&lt;/a&gt;, she became an Officer with the Order of Canada in 1985, and became Companion in the year 2000. In 1988, the &lt;a href="w%3AOrder%20of%20Ontario"&gt;Order of Ontario&lt;/a&gt; was awarded to her and in 2004 a street in Toronto was named after her. Her last interview was on CBC's ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Hour"&gt;The Hour&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ hosted by &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Stroumboulopoulos"&gt;George Stroumboulopoulos&lt;/a&gt; in 2005.

Callwood is survived by her husband, Trent Frayne, her two daughters, Jessie Frayne, Jill Frayne, and her son, Brant Frayne.

Former mayor of Toulouse &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APhilippe%20Douste-Blazy"&gt;Philippe Douste-Blazy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; welcomed more than 14 000 attendees to the city's Parc des Expositions. He summarized the candidates political program by saying: "The Republic [♡❤of France, red.♡❤] is not about defending laxity and impunity for the agitators, it's about guaranteeing the security and freedom of all through the respect of the laws and Justice." Sarkozy was &lt;a href="w%3AMinister%20of%20the%20Interior%20%28France%29"&gt;Minister of Interior Affairs&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2005%20civil%20unrest%20in%20France"&gt;2005 suburban riots in France&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , when he instituted a zero-tolerance policy. Of one of Sarkozy's rivals, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFran%C3%A7ois%20Bayrou"&gt;François Bayrou&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Douste-Blazy said that France didn't need a President who "undergoes and refuses to make choices."

In his speech of more than one hour, Sarkozy claimed the historical heritage of the founders of socialism and their values of right to work, payed holidays, social security, unemployment benefits, education, liberty of conscience, and of moral rights and the rights of the individual: "These values, I've wanted the Republican right side to reclaim them at a moment when the left side abandons them." He also criticised &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFran%C3%A7ois%20Hollande"&gt;François Hollande&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , chairman of the &lt;a href="Socialist%20Party%20%28France%29"&gt;French Socialist Party&lt;/a&gt;, and with him his wife and the socialist candidate for the Presidential elections, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AS%C3%A9gol%C3%A8ne%20Royal"&gt;Ségolène Royal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who, according to Sarkozy, "has forgotten Blum and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAlbert%20Camus"&gt;Camus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and doesn't know Jaurès."

A week ago, Ségolène Royal held a speech in &lt;a href="w%3ACarmaux"&gt;Carmaux&lt;/a&gt;, the home of Jaurès, where she proposed herself in continuity with Jaurès' battle for the values of employment, concluding her speech by saying: "It's important for the left side to know where we come from, because that helps also to foresee the future."

On Wednesday, she held a meeting in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMetz"&gt;Metz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , where she accused Sarkozy of wanting to exercise power alone, of knowing everything, of wanting an unequal health care system and of following the laws of money. "He proposes us the law of the strongest. Do you want it? Me neither! And I propose to you the law of most justice."

The City of &lt;a href="w%3AChicago"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt; has been chosen as the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; Applicant City for the &lt;a href="2016%20Summer%20Olympics"&gt;2016 Summer Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Olympic%20Committee"&gt;United States Olympic Committee&lt;/a&gt; (USOC) chose Chicago, which has never hosted an Olympics, over the &lt;a href="w%3A1932%20Summer%20Olympics"&gt;1932&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3A1984%20Summer%20Olympics"&gt;1984&lt;/a&gt; hosts &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%2C%20California"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;.

"On behalf of the United States Olympic Committee, we would like to congratulate Chicago on its selection as our Applicant City," said USOC Chairperson, &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Ueberroth"&gt;Peter Ueberroth&lt;/a&gt;. "Our ultimate goal at the outset was to identify the U.S. city with the best chance of competing internationally. In Chicago and Los Angeles, we had two outstanding bids and we are confident that Chicago is positioned to be competitive in the international field and will make our country proud."

Chicago will now submit a bid to the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Olympic%20Committee"&gt;International Olympic Committee&lt;/a&gt; in September 2007, and the host city will be chosen on October 2, 2009. Other cities likely to bid for the Games include &lt;a href="w%3APrague"&gt;Prague&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARome"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATokyo"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;. As the &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20Summer%20Olympics"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3A2012%20Summer%20Olympics"&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt; Games are to be held in Asia and Europe respectively, it is likely that a city in the Americas would be favorites for the Games. The United States last held the Games in &lt;a href="w%3AAtlanta%2C%20Georgia"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3A1996%20Summer%20Olympics"&gt;1996&lt;/a&gt;.

Chicago's bid involves construction of an Olympic Stadium in &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20Park%20%28Chicago%20park%29"&gt;Washington Park&lt;/a&gt; on the city's South Side and an athlete's village on the shores of &lt;a href="w%3ALake%20Michigan"&gt;Lake Michigan&lt;/a&gt;. Existing venues such as &lt;a href="w%3AWrigley%20Field"&gt;Wrigley Field&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASoldier%20Field"&gt;Soldier Field&lt;/a&gt; may be used for some events. In contrast to Chicago, the Los Angeles bid involved existing facilities with no need for constructing new venues.

♡❤Series even at 1-1. (Best of Seven)♡❤

The &lt;a href="w%3APittsburgh%20Penguins"&gt;Pittsburgh Penguins&lt;/a&gt; won their first playoff game since 2001, as they defeated the &lt;a href="w%3AOttawa%20Senators"&gt;Ottawa Senators&lt;/a&gt;, Saturday afternoon. &lt;a href="w%3ASidney%20Crosby"&gt;Sidney Crosby&lt;/a&gt; scored the game-winning goal midway through the third period, when he redirected a pass from teammate &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Recchi"&gt;Mark Recchi&lt;/a&gt; into the net behind Ottawa goaltender &lt;a href="w%3ARay%20Emery"&gt;Ray Emery&lt;/a&gt;. The Senators weren't pleased with the goaltending of Ray Emery, who despite only facing 21 shots, allowed four goals. Penguins netminder &lt;a href="w%3AMarc-Andre%20Fleury"&gt;Marc-Andre Fleury&lt;/a&gt;, however, was spectacular at times, denying 34 of 37 Senators' shots, including a game-saving stop of &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Fisher"&gt;Mike Fisher&lt;/a&gt; from the slot with 13.3 seconds remaining in regulation. The Penguins acquired &lt;a href="w%3AGary%20Roberts"&gt;Gary Roberts&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="w%3AFlorida%20Panthers"&gt;Florida Panthers&lt;/a&gt; for playoff experience, and that is what he gave the team today, scoring the game-tying goal in the third, and adding an assist. The Penguins and Senators are now tied in the best-of-seven series, with one game apiece.

&lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Whitney"&gt;Ryan Whitney&lt;/a&gt; gave the Pens the early lead when he scored his first goal of the postseason at 3:01, during a &lt;a href="w%3Apower%20play"&gt;power play&lt;/a&gt; opportunity. Ottawa would rally to take a 2-1 lead in the second, with &lt;a href="w%3AJason%20Spezza"&gt;Jason Spezza&lt;/a&gt; and captain &lt;a href="w%3A%20Daniel%20Alfredsson"&gt;Daniel Alfredsson&lt;/a&gt; each receiving credit for goals. Pittsburgh would storm back to tie the game in the third, when &lt;a href="w%3AGary%20Roberts"&gt;Gary Roberts&lt;/a&gt; picked up his first postseason goal with the Penguins at 2:04. Ottawa would answer with a goal to retain the lead one last time. The Penguins rookie phenom &lt;a href="w%3AJordan%20Staal"&gt;Jordan Staal&lt;/a&gt; scored his second goal in as many games at 9:34. With the game tied at three goals apiece, &lt;a href="w%3ASidney%20Crosby"&gt;Sidney Crosby&lt;/a&gt;, the youngest &lt;a href="w%3AArt%20Ross"&gt;Art Ross&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AArt%20Ross%20Trophy"&gt;trophy&lt;/a&gt; winner in &lt;a href="w%3ANHL"&gt;NHL&lt;/a&gt; history would step up. &lt;a href="w%3AEvgeni%20Malkin"&gt;Evgeni Malkin&lt;/a&gt; passed the puck to &lt;a href="w%3A"&gt;Mark Recchi&lt;/a&gt;, who would in turn move the puck up to Crosby where he would bury it behind the Senators' &lt;a href="w%3ARay%20Emery"&gt;Ray Emery&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>Pro-secular Turks rally against Erdogan's possible presidential candidacy</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Pro-secular%20Turks%20rally%20against%20Erdogan%27s%20possible%20presidential%20candidacy&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Several hundred thousand protesters marched on Saturday in &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;'s capital &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAnkara"&gt;Ankara&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to ensure that Turkey remains a secular Republic, and to deter prime minister &lt;a href="Recep%20Tayyip%20Erdo%C4%9Fan"&gt;Recep Tayyip Erdoğan&lt;/a&gt; from candidacy for the presidency. Mr. Erdoğan leads a moderate islamist party, and the secular establishment, that organised the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AProtect%20Your%20Republic%20Protest"&gt;"Protect Your Republic"-protest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , fears that he might be a threat to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASecular%20state"&gt;separation between religion and state&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that modern Turkey has known since &lt;a href="Mustafa%20Kemal%20Atat%C3%BCrk"&gt;Mustafa Kemal Atatürk&lt;/a&gt;.

Bussed into to the capital Ankara from the most far flung regions of Turkey, tens of thousands of Turks waving the Turkish flag chanted "Turkey is secular and will remain secular" and "We don't want an imam as president!". The organisation spoke of more than one million protesters, news source estimates range from 200 000 to 370 000. A lot of banners depicting Atatürk could be seen in the crowd, which marched on the cordoned-off mausoleum of the founder of the Turkish state.

One of the protesters, Ece Kaplan, told the ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20Times"&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤: "We believe in Islam; we are Muslims. But we don't want it to become our whole way of life." Her sister Muge Kaplan said: "We don't want to become Iran." 

Mr. Erdoğan's ruling &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJustice%20and%20Development%20Party%20%28Turkey%29"&gt;Justice and Development Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , founded by former Islamists, has a majority in the Turkish parliament, which is authorized by the constitution to elect the new president.

Erdoğan refutes allegations that he and his government are bent on steering Turkey, a key Western ally, toward an &lt;a href="Islam"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;-oriented path. Since coming to power more than four years ago, Erdoğan's government has overseen a swath of democratic reforms that helped Turkey win a date to open membership talks with the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; two years ago.

Western diplomats agree that Mr. Erdoğan has done nothing substantive to alter Turkey's pro-secular course, though his efforts to outlaw adultery and to forge closer relations with &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt; have provoked some concern. 

As president, Mr. Erdoğan would be the commander-in-chief of Turkey's rigidly pro secular military. On Thursday, army chief of staff general &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AYa%C5%9Far%20B%C3%BCy%C3%BCkan%C4%B1t"&gt;Yaşar Büyükanıt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; released a message underlining this: "We hope that someone who is loyal to the principles of the republic - not just in words but in essence - is elected president." As president Erdoğan also would have the power to appoint members of the judiciary and university rectors.

With just days left for candidates to submit their names, only one person, a comedian named &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMetin%20Uca"&gt;Metin Uca&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , has declared his intention to run for president. On Friday, President &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAhmet%20Necdet%20Sezer"&gt;Sezer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; waded into the presidential debate saying that Turkey's secular regime faced its gravest danger since the founding of the Republic in 1923. Throughout his seven-year term, Mr. Sezer vetoed legislation and the appointment of scores of senior officials forwarded by Mr. Erdoğan, arguing that they posed a threat to secularism.

♡❤Rangers lead series 2-0. (Best of Seven)♡❤

The &lt;a href="w%3AAtlanta%20Thrashers"&gt;Thrashers'&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJohan%20Hedberg"&gt;Johan Hedberg&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Rangers"&gt;Rangers'&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3A%20Henrik%20Lundqvist"&gt;Henrik Lundqvist&lt;/a&gt; put on goaltending clinics Saturday night, but it would be Lundqvist that had the last laugh as the Atlanta Thrashers fell to the New York Rangers 2-1 before 18,803 at &lt;a href="w%3APhilips%20Arena"&gt;Philips Arena&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AAtlanta%2C%20Georgia"&gt;Atlanta, Georgia&lt;/a&gt;. Hedberg would win the first star of the game, earning a .949 save percentage, but Lundqvist would win the game, holding Atlanta to just one goal, while stopping 27 of 28 shots. The Thrashers, playing in just their second postseason contest in club history, dating back to 1997, are under pressure to win after going down in the series by two games.

New York's &lt;a href="w%3ASean%20Avery"&gt;Sean Avery&lt;/a&gt; scored the only goal of the first two periods at 8:08 in the first. The scoresheet would remain blank until the third period, when at 5:35, &lt;a href="w%3AIllya%20Kovalchuk"&gt;Illya Kovalchuk&lt;/a&gt; scored Atlanta's only goal of the contest to tie the score, 1-1. The score would remain tied until 15:59, when New York's &lt;a href="w%3ABrendan%20Shanahan"&gt;Brendan Shanahan&lt;/a&gt; beat Hedberg for the game winning goal.

♡❤Series equal at 1-1. (Best of Seven)♡❤

The &lt;a href="w%3AVancouver%20Canucks"&gt;Vancouver Canucks&lt;/a&gt; came out flat just one game after the sixth longest game in &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Hockey%20League"&gt;NHL&lt;/a&gt; Playoff history. &lt;a href="w%3AMarty%20Turco"&gt;Marty Turco&lt;/a&gt; shut down the Canucks offense, stopping all 35 shots he faced, as the &lt;a href="w%3ADallas%20Stars"&gt;Dallas Stars&lt;/a&gt; tied the best-of-seven series. Turco picked up right where he had left off in the previous game, when he held the Canucks scoreless through four overtime periods, keeping the net empty for over 90 minutes. 

The Stars scored in the first 24 seconds in the game, even though they couldn't score in 78:06 of overtime in Game 1. Jeff Halpern scored his 1st goal of the postseason, beating Vancouver goaltender &lt;a href="w%3ARoberto%20Luongo"&gt;Roberto Luongo&lt;/a&gt;, who hadn't allowed a goal in nearly five periods of play. The only other goal of the game would also belong to Joel Lundqvist, who scored 45 seconds into the final period.

Dallas will looks to take the series lead when they do battle again with Vancouver on Sunday, this time on the Stars' home ice. Opening face off is scheduled for 9:30 pm EDT.

♡❤Series even at 1-1. (Best of Seven)♡❤

The Tampa Bay Lightning got back into the best-of-seven series, tonight, drawing even with the Devils at one game apiece. &lt;a href="w%3AVincent%20Lecavalier"&gt;Vincent Lecavalier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20St.%20Louis"&gt;Martin St. Louis&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AFilip%20Kuba"&gt;Filip Kuba&lt;/a&gt; all scored for the Lightning. Offense plus sturdy goaltending by &lt;a href="w%3AJohan%20Holmqvist"&gt;Johan Holmqvist&lt;/a&gt; equaled a win for the Lightning, which will return home to the &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Pete%20Times%20Forum"&gt;St. Pete Times Forum&lt;/a&gt; for the next two games of the series.

Both Lecavalier and Devils center &lt;a href="w%3AZach%20Parise"&gt;Zach Parise&lt;/a&gt; have three goals in the past two games.

Tampa and Jersey will face each other at least three more times in the opening round of the NHL Playoffs. The next meeting between the two clubs will be Monday, April 16, at 7:00 pm EDT, when the teams will meet again at the St. Pete Times Forum in Tampa, Florida.

♡❤Series tied at 1-1. (Best of Seven)♡❤

After trashing the New York Islanders just two days before, the Buffalo Sabres may have thought this series was in the bag. Maybe they were already looking ahead to the Conference Semifinals. Whatever the case, Buffalo wasn't entirely in the game tonight, and the Islanders capitalized on it. &lt;a href="w%3ARick%20DiPietro"&gt;Rick DiPietro&lt;/a&gt;, out last night from injury, returned to play a spectacular game against the Sabres. DiPietro stopped 32 of 34 shots faced, compiling a .941 save percentage. In the post-game press conference, DiPietro stated that he "could've used a little WD-40 on the joints here and there". DiPietro was just fine without any WD-40, picking up his first win in the 2007 Stanley Cup Playoffs.

New York took a 2-0 lead and never looked back, even though Buffalo would manage to tie the game for around 6:00 toward the end of the game. The tie was broken midway through the third period, when &lt;a href="w%3AMarc-Andr%C3%A9%20Bergeron"&gt;Marc-Andre Bergeron&lt;/a&gt; buried the puck behind Sabres goaltender &lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Miller%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;Ryan Miller&lt;/a&gt;.

The Eastern Conference series between the Islanders and Sabres, which is currently tied up at 1-1, will continue on Monday, Apr 16, at 7:30 pm EDT in New York.

<h3>Policy pundit says UK has 'lost the plot' on alcohol</h3>

Writing in PPR, the Institute of Public Policy Research's journal, Jasper Gerard has argued that, "When it comes to booze, society seems to have lost its senses," and implies the UK has lost-the-plot on alcohol regulation.

The claim in comes alongside calls for 'tough-love' tactics to tackle the UK's drinking culture in which a fifth of 11-15 year olds drink alcohol at least once a week.

Amongst the recommendations, is the idea that the legal drinking age, in the UK, should be raised to 21. Gerard states that with such a move, "it is at least possible that those in their early and mid teens will not see drink as something they will soon be allowed to do so therefore they might as well start doing it surreptitiously now."

Both industry, and alcoholism support groups have already challenged Gerard’s comments.

<h3>39 now dead in Thai floods</h3>

A flash flood sent a torrent of water rushing over two waterfalls in southern &lt;a href="Thailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;. More than 100 tourists and people celebrating &lt;a href="w%3AThai%20New%20Year"&gt;Songkran&lt;/a&gt; (Thai New Year) were cooling off in the water beneath the falls. "Seven more dead bodies were brought to hospital this morning, bringing the death toll up to thirty-five," said Sinchai Rongdej, the hospital director at Yantakhao district. Fifteen of the dead were children. Thirty-four of the confirmed dead were Thai, Sinchai said, while one of the victims was a Laos national. Latest reports from the Bangkok Post indicate that the death toll had risen to 39 by Sunday nightfall, including 17 children. Of those injured, 25 have so far been discharged from hospital..

Provincial governor, Arnon Manasvanich said, "The search is continuing, but my belief is we might find more bodies of women and children as they couldn't escape in time."

"We are still searching in the hope of finding survivors -- we do have hope left," said Colonel Sonthichai Awatanakulthep, Yantakhao police chief. In a later statement, &lt;a href="w%3ATrang%20Province"&gt;Trang Province&lt;/a&gt; police Major-General Kachorn Siriwan admitted that at least 30 people were still missing.

<h3>Will Iranian detainees remain in US custody?</h3>

Five &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;ians captured in January by the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; during a security operation in &lt;a href="w%3AErbil"&gt;Erbil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; are continuing to be held by US authorities, despite objections from the Iranian government.

♡❤BBC News♡❤ reported that US Secretary of State argued for the their release
on the grounds they were "no longer useful," but was overruled by the White House. Iran claims the five captured are diplomats, while the US maintains that they are members of the Revolutionary Guard and were supplying arms, money, and military training to Iraqi insurgents.

However, since that report, Iran said it has received some signals concerning the possible release of the five Iranians, state television reported.

Sunday was another violent day in &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;. Bomb attacks on a market place and a mini-bus, claimed the lives of as many as 35 people in &lt;a href="w%3AShia%20Islam"&gt;Shi'ite&lt;/a&gt; neighborhoods of &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;'s capital city.

Two &lt;a href="w%3ACar%20bomb"&gt;car bombs&lt;/a&gt; went off within minutes of each other at a market place in the al-Shurta al-Arabaa district. The second bomb may have been targeting rescuers. At least eighteen are dead and many wounded.

In &lt;a href="w%3AKazimain"&gt;Kadhimiya&lt;/a&gt; in northern Baghdad, a &lt;a href="w%3ASuicide%20attack"&gt;suicide bomber&lt;/a&gt; boarded a minibus. Six were killed and eleven wounded when the explosives belt detonated.

In &lt;a href="w%3AKarrada"&gt;Karrada&lt;/a&gt;, an affluent neighborhood of Baghdad, a parked minibus blew up in a street with electronics shops, possibly targeting a police patrol. Five were left dead and another ten injured.

Separately, two &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AA%C3%A9rospatiale%20Puma"&gt;Puma transport helicopters&lt;/a&gt; crashed after they reportedly collided. Two crew members were killed.

&lt;a href="w%3AA1%20Team%20New%20Zealand"&gt;A1 Team New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; has won the feature race at the &lt;a href="w%3AA1%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;A1 Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AShanghai"&gt;Shanghai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; today, followed by &lt;a href="w%3AA1%20Team%20Great%20Britain"&gt;A1 Team Great Britain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AA1%20Team%20Germany"&gt;A1 Team Germany&lt;/a&gt;. The third place win for Germany has secured the 2006/2007 championship.

In qualifying for the sprint race, Great Britain's driver &lt;a href="w%3ARobbie%20Kerr"&gt;Robbie Kerr&lt;/a&gt; managed to secure the pole position with the fastest lap time recorded this weekend. New Zealand's driver, &lt;a href="w%3AJonny%20Reid"&gt;Jonny Reid&lt;/a&gt;, started in second position, narrowly missing out on what would have been his third pole position of the season. Third and fourth place starters are the United States and Germany respectively.

Great Britain managed to win the sprint race, thus securing a first place start in the feature race. During the entire sprint race, Great Britain were the leaders, with a "comfortable" lead, always maintaining their position in front of New Zealand. Germany replaced America, becoming the third place sprint-race winners.

During the feature race Jonny Reid, driving New Zealand's ♡❤Black Beauty♡❤ car, passed Great Britain on lap number 16 of the 50-lap race.

According to &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;i media reports, a &lt;a href="Palestine"&gt;Palestinian&lt;/a&gt; group, purportedly linked to &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; has announced they have killed &lt;a href="Alan%20Johnston"&gt;Alan Johnston&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; journalist who went missing in Gaza five weeks ago. 

The pronouncement came in the form of an e-mail to the media on Sunday. "We are deeply concerned about what we are hearing, but we stress at this stage, it is rumor with no independent verification," said the BBC.

The Palestinian Jihad and Tawheed Brigades said that it will release a video of the killing, and blamed the killing on the British and Palestinian governments for not heeding its demands to release prisoners detained in Israel.

However, Palestinian interior ministry sources have disputed the claims. "I have been in contact with all the security chiefs since I heard the information. There is no information to confirm the killing of the journalist Johnston," said Hani al-Qawasmi, Palestinian Interior Minister. "At the Interior Ministry we have not received any demands of any kind, whether for ransom or anything else. No party has said it is holding the journalist," said Qawasmi.

Hamilton's teammate &lt;a href="w%3AFernando%20Alonso"&gt;Fernando Alonso&lt;/a&gt; was unable to keep &lt;a href="w%3ANick%20Heidfeld"&gt;Nick Heidfeld&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3ABMW"&gt;BMW&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3ASauber"&gt;Sauber&lt;/a&gt; off his back, who passed last year's champion easily in one overtaking attempt.

♡❤Ducks lead series 2-0. (Best of Seven)♡❤
&lt;a href="w%3AFran%C3%A7ois%20Beauchemin"&gt;François Beauchemin&lt;/a&gt; scored on a pair of power plays and &lt;a href="w%3AIlya%20Bryzgalov"&gt;Ilya Bryzgalov&lt;/a&gt; made 30 saves to help the Ducks to a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven Western Conference series. Games 3 and 4 are in St. Paul on Sunday and Tuesday.

The Wild struggled again on the power play, going 0-for-6 after failing to convert on four power plays in the 2-1 opening loss. Then there was the Ducks' short-handed goal. &lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Getzlaf"&gt;Ryan Getzlaf&lt;/a&gt; took a pass from &lt;a href="w%3ATravis%20Moen"&gt;Travis Moen&lt;/a&gt; along the left boards, feinted inside against Minnesota defenseman &lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20%C5%A0koula"&gt;Martin Skoula&lt;/a&gt;, cut outside and zipped around him. The Ducks' center then flipped the puck over &lt;a href="w%3ANicklas%20B%C3%A4ckstr%C3%B6m"&gt;Nicklas Backstrom's&lt;/a&gt; stick.

Minnesota coach &lt;a href="w%3AJacques%20Lemaire"&gt;Jacques Lemaire&lt;/a&gt; said: "I thought we played a great game. It was just getting the power play to go a little better and staying out of the box. The rest of the game was fine."

&lt;a href="w%3AMikko%20Koivu"&gt;Mikko Koivu&lt;/a&gt; scored from the top of the crease, managing to get off the shot as he was falling down, and the puck got past Bryzgalov on the glove side. &lt;a href="w%3AMari%C3%A1n%20G%C3%A1bor%C3%ADk"&gt;Marian Gaborik&lt;/a&gt; scored at 3:33 of the second period to draw the Wild even 1-1.

Manchester United and Watford met Saturday at the neutral ground of Villa Park for the semi-final of the FA Cup. Both teams went into the game on highs, as United had thrashed Roma 7-1 during the week, and Watford had defeated Portsmouth 4-2 in the Premiership. With that confidence boost for Watford boss Adrian Boothroyd, Watford sported an attacking lineup with Hameur Bouazza and Tamas Priskin as strikers. United's recent injury troubles allowed Alan Smith to play as strike partner to Wayne Rooney with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer on the bench.

The first chance in the match fell to United, and the Red Devils capitalized. A long ball by Carrick was left by both Smith and Giggs before it came to Rooney, and he cut inside before blasting a shot high to the right of Richard Lee, giving United an early lead. Watford were not dispirited by the early goal, and soon began to create chances through set pieces. A flailing boot by a Watford player in the area connected with Edwin Van Der Sar's recently healed nose, and the big Dutch keeper had to have splints put in before play could continue. Watford took advantage of the stoppage to catch their breath, and scored as soon as play resumed when Hameur Bouazza's side footed volley caught Van Der Sar unaware, and crept in off the crossbar after deflecting off Gabriel Heinze. United's response was nearly instant, as Smith's pass into Rooney released him on the right. After Lee nearly blocked a pass into Ronaldo, the Portuguese winger was able to bobble the ball home, scoring his twenty-first goal of the season, and restoring United's lead. Gavin Mahon then had a chance to equalize again for Watford, but his side footed volley was saved by Van Der Sar. Ronaldo then had a chance for his second as he was released by Rooney, but a last ditch tackle by DeMerit kept the scoreline at 2-1. A groin injury for United's Rio Ferdinand then forced Alex Ferguson to replace him with Darren Fletcher, a move which saw a shuffle in the entire back line. Rooney then had a chance for a brace, but his hard shot was palmed away by Lee.

Watford started the second half strongly with Bouazza nearly scoring off a long throw, but his side footed effort went just wide. Alan Smith then set up Rooney's second goal of the match as his curling cross was easily deflected in by Rooney's left foot. Cristiano Ronaldo was then replaced with Kieran Richardson, and the substitute made nearly an instant impact, scoring United's fourth goal of the afternoon. A well timed pass by Smith was met by the sprinting Richardson, and he easily chipped the ball over Lee and into the back of the net to secure a place in the final for United.

Relegation bound Watford will meet Blackburn in the Premiership next, while United have a league game of their own at Old Trafford against Sheffield United.

&lt;a href="w%3ADon%20Ho"&gt;Don Ho&lt;/a&gt;, arguably one of &lt;a href="w%3AHawaii"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;'s best-known entertainers who entertained generations of tourists in Waikiki, died Saturday of heart failure. He was 76.

Ho was pronounced dead at 11:59 a.m. Saturday at Queen's Medical Center in &lt;a href="w%3AHonolulu"&gt;Honolulu&lt;/a&gt; after collapsing at his Waikiki residence. 

In 2005, Ho was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy and underwent experimental stem cell treatment that November in &lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to repair his damaged heart muscle. He resumed a reduced workload in January 2006 and continued his performances at the Ohana Waikiki Beachcomber hotel until his death; his last performance was Thursday.

Born in Honolulu on August 13, 1930, Ho was raised in Kaneohe and graduated from &lt;a href="w%3AKamehameha%20Schools"&gt;Kamehameha Schools&lt;/a&gt;. After receiving his bachelor's degree from the University of Hawaii and serving in the United States Air Force, he started his entertaining career, first at his family's bar in Kaneohe, then in Waikiki since 1962. It was while he was performing at Duke Kahanamoku's club in Waikiki that his band caught the attention of record executives.

His best known hit, "Tiny Bubbles," reached #8 on ♡❤Billboard♡❤ magazine's charts. Ho would go on to record more albums and perform at venues across the United States as well as in Waikiki. A nationally televised variety show known as the Don Ho Show aired on ABC from 1976 to 1977.

Local entertainers remember him for his ability to connect with his audience as well as his laid-back, mumbled delivery that became his signature.

Ho is survived by wife Haumea Hebenstreit Ho and 10 children, including singer and actress &lt;a href="w%3AHoku%20Ho"&gt;Hoku Ho&lt;/a&gt;.

♡❤Senators lead series 2-1. (Best of Seven)♡❤

The Ottawa Senators defeated the Pittsburgh Penguins, Sunday evening, to take a 2-1 lead in the best-of-seven Easter Conference Series. The Senators kept finding holes around Pittsburgh goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury, scoring four times on 25 shots. Sidney Crosby became the first player to score in their first three NHL postseason games since 2001, but it wasn't enough to lift the Penguins to victory.

Gary Roberts, who scored in Saturday afternoon's game, got the Penguins off to an early lead, scoring just 52 seconds into regulation. That lead wouldn't hold up, however, as Dean McAmmond would knot it up at 18:04, when he would bury the puck behind Fleury. The Penguins struggled in the second period, as they have often as of late, allowing three more goals in the period. The Penguins offense kicked in in the third period, as Sidney Crosby would add a spectacular diving goal late in the game, but the Senators managed to weather the storm to emerge victorious.

The Penguins, despite being down in the series, will try to tie the series Tuesday night, when Mellon Arena will play host to the Ottawa Senators for game four of the best-of-seven series.

♡❤Red Wings lead series 2-0. (Best of Seven)♡❤

The Calgary Flames fell to the Detroit Red Wings Sunday, giving the Red Wings total control over the series, 2-0. Detroit capitalized on Calgary's mistakes, scoring twice in the first 3:50 to take a 2-0 lead they would never relenquish. Flames' goaltender Miikka Kiprusoff was totally under siege throughout the game, attacked by 51 shots.

Pavel Datsyuk gave the Red Wings an early lead when he scored the game's first goal just 1:02 into regulation. With the 1-0 lead and a power play oppertunity, Nicklas Lindstrom, arguably the NHL's best defenseman scored to give the Wings a 2-0 lead. Calgary's Dion Phaneuf scored early in the second, but the Flames could never generate enough offense to make up for their early mistakes.

This Eastern Conference series continues in Calgary on Tuesday, April 17th, at 10:00 pm EDT, when the Flames will be looking to get back into the series with a win on home ice.

<h3>Benn criticises concept of 'war on terror'</h3>

&lt;a href="UK"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASecretary%20of%20State%20for%20International%20Development"&gt;Secretary of State for International Development&lt;/a&gt; and deputy Labour leadership candidate &lt;a href="w%3AHilary%20Benn"&gt;Hilary Benn&lt;/a&gt;, has criticised &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush's&lt;/a&gt; '&lt;a href="w%3Awar%20on%20terror"&gt;war on terror&lt;/a&gt;' concept in a speech given to the Center on International Cooperation, a US think tank.

Benn's speech argued that the phrase 'war on terror' should be deprecated because it can't be won by military means alone as well as indicating that the 'war-on-terror' concept may have actually assisted terrorist groups by giving them a sense of belonging.

<h3>Sadr ministers leave al-Maliki's cabinet</h3>

Six ministers in radical cleric &lt;a href="w%3AMuqtada%20al-Sadr"&gt;Muqtada al-Sadr&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ASadrist%20Movement"&gt;Sadrist Movement&lt;/a&gt; have resigned from the &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;i government, because &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Iraq"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ANouri%20al-Maliki"&gt;Nouri al-Maliki&lt;/a&gt; did not push for a timetable for the withdrawal of foreign troops from the country.

At a press conference, the head of Sadr's parliamentary bloc Nassar Rubaie, read a statement from al-Sadr:
"Considering the public interest, we found that it was necessary to issue an order to the ministers of the Sadr bloc to immediately withdraw from the Iraqi government,"
The statement continued, "The six ministries shall be handed over to the government itself, hoping that this government would give these responsibilities to independent bodies who wish to serve the interests of the people and the country."

Al-Maliki was happy the Sadrists respected the political process. The move could have threatened to topple his government, but so far the Sadrist Movement is still part of the ruling coalition.

<h3>Undercover reporter finds corruption and drugs at private prison</h3>

Investigations undertaken by an undercover journalist, unearthed corruption, intimidation of staff, as well as exposing issues concerning availability of drugs within &lt;a href="w%3AHer%20Majesty%27s%20Prison%20Service"&gt;HMP&lt;/a&gt; Rye Hill prison in &lt;a href="w%3AWarwickshire"&gt;Warwickshire&lt;/a&gt;, a class B facility which is privately run. The investigative journalist finds staff living in fear of their lives and a massive &lt;a href="w%3Ablack%20market"&gt;black market&lt;/a&gt; in the prison which is run by GSL Group. The company countered that the undercover reporter, did not follow his training as a guard.

<h3>UK's Department of Trade and Industry may be restructured</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3ASecretary%20of%20State%20for%20Trade%20and%20Industry"&gt;Secretary of State for Trade and Industry&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAlistair%20Darling"&gt;Alistair Darling&lt;/a&gt; said that some MPs have called for the scrapping of &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Trade%20and%20Industry"&gt;Department of Trade and Industry&lt;/a&gt; (DTI). His statement came as a survey of 145 firms found that only 8% saw the DTI playing an important role. He has, however, said that DTI needed to continue for nuclear decommissioning.

A survey of &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Chamber%20of%20Commerce"&gt;British Chamber of Commerce&lt;/a&gt; (BCC) found that British companies feel it more difficult to start and grow a business today than ten years ago. On a positive note, of the top 750 &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;an companies, UK companies generated a third of total profits.

<h3>Pipeline firms consolidate in Russia</h3>

According to Russian officials, &lt;a href="w%3ATransneft"&gt;Transneft&lt;/a&gt; and Transnefteprodukt(TNP) are to merge. The merger will create a "single network of oil and oil products via the pipelines and protect the economic interests of the Russian Federation," according to a Kremlin Statement. The move would give the companies concerned more power internationally, say analysts.

President &lt;a href="Vladimir%20Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; has signed a decree, approving the merger. The &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n government would keep a 75% ownership stake in the combined firm. The merger of firms is to be complete in five months.

<h3>US still seeking missing ex-FBI agent in Iran</h3>
For the third time in a month, the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; has requested information about a missing former FBI agent believed to be in &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;. The State Department says Robert Levinson went missing while visiting &lt;a href="w%3AKish%20Island"&gt;Kish Island&lt;/a&gt; in March. He is retired and is said to have been there on his own business interests.

Iran's previous responses have been to request more information about Levinson. Each time, the inquiries went through &lt;a href="Switzerland"&gt;Swiss&lt;/a&gt; diplomats.

<h1>New Zealand's telecommunications ranks low in OECD</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=New%20Zealand%27s%20telecommunications%20ranks%20low%20in%20OECD&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The New Zealand Commerce Commission, who promote competition in the New Zealand market, have released a report today that has shown that New Zealand's telecommunications sector is very expensive compared to other OECD countries.

In the report, the Commerce Commission ranks various call plans, both cellular and landline, with other similar plans in the OECD.

United Kingdom company, Teligen did the data gathering in November 2006. All prices exclude &lt;a href="w%3AGoods%20and%20Services%20Tax%20%28New%20Zealand%29"&gt;G.S.T.&lt;/a&gt; (Goods and Services Tax).

The following data is for low mobile user plans. One of Vodafone's mobile phone plan titled Vodafone Base 20 costs NZ$299.54 annually, which was given a rank of 22 out of the other 30 OECD countries. One of Telecom's plan titled Telecom FLEXI Mytime costs $336.11 annually, and is ranked 26. Another Vodafone plan, Motormouth Prepay costs $386.85 which gives it a rank of 28. Telecom's Go Prepaid Mates' Rates plan costs the same amount as Vodafone's Motormouth and thus has the same rank. Note, some of the above plans are set contract plans, which means they must be subscribed to for a set amount of time, and have other restrictive terms.

The following data is for medium mobile user plans. Vodafone Base 60 costs an annual amount of $598.01 which gives it a rank of 25. Vodafone Choose 60 + Your Time + TXT 100 costs $660.94 each year, which gives it a rank of 27 internationally. Telecom's FLEXI Anytime costs $811.29 with a rank of 29. Again, some of the plans above have restrictive terms and a set term contract.

The high user market plans follow. The Vodafone Choose 120 + Your Time 100 + TXT 100 costs $886.56, which gives it a rank of 23. The Telecom FLEXI Anytime plan is the most expensive in New Zealand costing $1,368.63 each year. It is also ranked at the bottom of the OECD at 30.

The landline plans did not fare any much better, or worse, than the mobile phone plans.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia%20cricket%20team"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; have beaten &lt;a href="w%3ASri%20Lankan%20cricket%20team"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt; by seven wickets in the Super 8 phase of the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Cricket%20World%20Cup"&gt;World Cup&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3AQueen%27s%20Park%2C%20Grenada"&gt;Queen's Park&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20George%27s%2C%20Grenada"&gt;St. George's&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGrenada"&gt;Grenada&lt;/a&gt;. Both teams had qualified for the semi-final stage of the competition before the match.

Sri Lanka faltered early in their innings, struggling to 27-3. &lt;a href="w%3AChamara%20Silva"&gt;Silva&lt;/a&gt; (64) and &lt;a href="w%3AMahela%20Jayawardene"&gt;Jayawardene&lt;/a&gt; (72) shared a fourth-wicket partnership of 140 to help Sri Lanka to 167-4. However wickets fell regularly after that, losing their next five wickets for just 17 runs, before &lt;a href="w%3AMalinga%20Bandara"&gt;Bandara&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AFarveez%20Maharoof"&gt;Maharoof&lt;/a&gt;'s late stand of 34. &lt;a href="w%3ANathan%20Bracken"&gt;Nathan Bracken&lt;/a&gt; was the pick of the Australian bowlers, taking 4/19.

Australia were never troubled by the modest target and a bowling attack missing &lt;a href="w%3AMuttiah%20Muralitharan"&gt;Muttiah Muralitharan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AChaminda%20Vaas"&gt;Chaminda Vaas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALasith%20Malinga"&gt;Lasith Malinga&lt;/a&gt;. They reached the target of 227 in 42.4 overs for the loss of just three wickets. &lt;a href="w%3ARicky%20Ponting"&gt;Ricky Ponting&lt;/a&gt; was Australia's top scorer with 66 off 80 balls while &lt;a href="w%3AAndrew%20Symonds"&gt;Andrew Symonds&lt;/a&gt; scored 63 off 71 balls. Sri Lanka's best bowling performance came from &lt;a href="w%3ARussel%20Arnold"&gt;Russel Arnold&lt;/a&gt; with 2/20.

♡❤Ducks lead series 3-0. (Best of Seven)♡❤

The Minnesota Wild fell to the Anaheim Ducks on Sunday, putting their season in jeopardy. Anaheim needs only one win in any of the final four games to win the series and the right to move on to the Western Conference Semifinals. The Wild have been close in every game of the series, but have fell short each time.

Minnesota coach &lt;a href="w%3AJacques%20Lemaire"&gt;Jacques Lemaire&lt;/a&gt; said: "Everyone was saying, 'Shoot the puck! Shoot the puck!' on the bench and then they went back on the ice and they didn't shoot it," coach Jacques Lemaire said. "The guys recognized the mistakes we were making and couldn't adjust." 

Andy McDonald gave the Ducks the lead in the first, scoring on the power play to give the Ducks the early advantage. Ilya Bryzgalov would help the Ducks' cause, stopping 19 of 20 shots faced. Rob Niedermayer got his first goal of the postseason in the third period to double the Ducks' lead. Petteri Nummelin scored the only goal for the Wild with :39 remaining in regulation, which wouldn't be enough time to mount a comeback.

Sunday's loss beckoned in do or die time for the Wild, who must win Tuesday, when Minnesota will host the Anaheim Ducks. If the Wild cannot pick up a win in Tuesday's game, the series will be lost, as well as Minnesota's season.

Two shootings at &lt;a href="w%3AVirginia%20Polytechnic%20Institute%20and%20State%20University"&gt;Virginia Tech&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ABlacksburg%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Blacksburg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Virginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; have left 33 people dead, gunman included, in the deadliest civilian shooting in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. A further 15 people are being treated in a hospital. According to police, the gunman committed suicide. 

At a 4:45 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20American%20Eastern%20Time%20Zone"&gt;EST&lt;/a&gt; press conference, it was stated that no names of the injured or killed will be released soon. According to the press conference, the shooter shot and killed two people at an on-campus dormitory in a "domestic dispute." He then walked to the other end of the campus and began to open fire on students.

<h2>Locations</h2>

Two separate shootings are reported to have taken place; one at 7:15 AM at West Ambler Johnston Hall, a co-ed dormitory, and one at about 9:30 AM EDT in Norris Hall, an engineering building on the other side of the campus. In the week preceding the shooting there had been two bomb threats directed at Virginia Tech; the first at Torgersen Hall, the second at multiple engineering buildings. The university had offered a $5,000 reward for information on these threats.

Police do not know if the incidents are connected and are trying to establish a link.

<h3>West Ambler Johnston Hall</h3>

Two people, one male and one female were shot and killed at West Ambler Johnston Hall, in what police initially were led to believe was a domestic incident. That building was secured immediately by police, who had "reason to believe " that the gunman had already left the building.

Police, who were hiding behind trees and other cover at the time, told students to "get out of there". Matt Waldron, a student at Virginia Tech, claims that two students panicked and jumped out of the top story of West Ambler Johnston Hall, which houses at least 895 male and female students out of Virginia Tech's student population of over 26,000. One student broke his leg, while another was described as "not in good shape".

<h3>Norris Hall</h3>

The second shooting occurred approximately two hours after the first at Norris Hall. In this incident 31 people died, including the gunman. Police indicated that he had taken his own life.

Video taken from the cell phone camera of Jamal Albarghouti watches police move into position as 27 shots (some fired in continuous bursts) are fired inside Norris within the small time it was recording. The weapon or weapons involved have been speculated to be either a pair of 9mm handguns or a single 9mm handgun with a .22 caliber handgun, although the police declined to reveal the weapon or weapons used by the shooter.

The video also gives a loud bang at the end. This has been speculated to be some kind of an instrument or tactical explosive used by police (the doors to Norris Hall were found to be chained), or whether it is a separate weapon used by the shooter is still unclear.

Officials believe that the shooter at Norris Hall was an Asian male in his 20s who was wearing a maroon cap and a leather jacket.

<h2>Aftermath</h2>
The university has canceled all classes, and is urging students to stay indoors and away from windows, even though the police had already taken one person into custody. The university also requests that "persons off campus not come to campus".

A message posted on the Virginia Tech web page said that classes will be canceled today and tomorrow. Faculty and students have been told to evacuate the campus. All 23 schools in &lt;a href="w%3AMontgomery%20County%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Montgomery County, VA&lt;/a&gt;, are on lockdown.

President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; was made aware of the shootings and according to the White House said, "thoughts and prayers for those who are dealing with this." Senate majority and minority leaders &lt;a href="w%3AHarry%20Reid"&gt;Harry Reid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMitch%20McConnell"&gt;Mitch McConnell&lt;/a&gt; led a prayer service and moment of silence for the faculty, students, and everyone at Virginia Tech during the Senate floor session. House speaker &lt;a href="Nancy%20Pelosi"&gt;Nancy Pelosi&lt;/a&gt; led a prayer and moment of silence on the House floor.

&lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20W.%20Steger"&gt;Charles W. Steger&lt;/a&gt;, President of Virginia Tech, said the following in a news conference:

In a press conference aired on television, President Bush said "Schools should be places of safety, sanctuary and learning, when that sanctuary is violated, the impact is felt in every American classroom in every American community."

♡❤Canucks lead series 2-1. (Best of Seven)♡❤

An overtime goal by &lt;a href="w%3ATaylor%20Pyatt"&gt;Taylor Pyatt&lt;/a&gt; at 7:47 of the first overtime gave the Vancouver Canucks a 2-1 lead in the best of seven series on Sunday night. 

Dallas scored first through &lt;a href="w%3AStu%20Barnes"&gt;Stu Barnes&lt;/a&gt; when he redirected a long shot by &lt;a href="w%3AStephane%20Robidas"&gt;Stephane Robidas&lt;/a&gt; past goalkeeper &lt;a href="w%3ARoberto%20Luongo"&gt;Roberto Luongo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3APhilippe%20Boucher"&gt;Philippe Boucher&lt;/a&gt; earned the other assist on the goal. 

&lt;a href="w%3AMarty%20Turco"&gt;Marty Turco&lt;/a&gt; looked to be headed for his second consecutive playoff shutout, but &lt;a href="w%3AJan%20Bulis"&gt;Jan Bulis&lt;/a&gt; dashed his dreams 5:18 into the third period as he put home a rebound from a shot by &lt;a href="w%3AJannik%20Hansen"&gt;Jannik Hansen&lt;/a&gt;. Vancouver outshot the Stars 15-4 in the third period, but had a scare when Roberto Luongo was hit by &lt;a href="w%3ALadislav%20Nagy"&gt;Ladislav Nagy&lt;/a&gt;. A trainer came on to assist Luongo, who had fallen on his back, but he was able to continue.

Taylor Pyatt then put the game away in overtime on a one-time shot off a pass from &lt;a href="w%3ABryan%20Smolinski"&gt;Bryan Smolinski&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AKenya"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Cheruiyot"&gt;Robert Cheruiyot&lt;/a&gt; won the men's division of the 111th running of the &lt;a href="w%3ABoston%20Marathon"&gt;Boston Marathon&lt;/a&gt; finishing with a unofficial time of 2:14:13 seconds. This is Kenya's 15th win in 17 years. It is also Cheruiyot's third Boston Marathon win and second consecutive win. Cheruiyot first won in 2003, then again last year and setting the current course record of 2:07:14. He was able to win despite a slick, wet road, fierce winds on the final stretch and headaches that have plagued him since suffering a concussion sliding across the finish line in the Chicago Marathon last year after a fall. "When the lion is chasing the antelope, he doesn't look back. He has to eat, so when I run, I don't stare at my time," stated Cheruiyot.
&lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ALidiya%20Grigoryeva"&gt;Lidiya Grigoryeva&lt;/a&gt; captured the women's division crown with an unofficial time of 2:29:18. This is her first Boston Marathon win and Russia's fourth win. She beat last year's champion Kenyan &lt;a href="w%3ARita%20Jeptoo"&gt;Rita Jeptoo&lt;/a&gt; and the American favorite &lt;a href="w%3ADeena%20Kastor"&gt;Deena Kastor&lt;/a&gt;, who was born in &lt;a href="w%3AWaltham%2C%20Massachuetts"&gt;Waltham&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; conquered the wheelchair divisions winning with Masazumi Soejima capturing the men's wheelchair crown with an unofficial time of 1:29:16 beating &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;'s Ernst Van Dyk who hoping to tie with the current Marathon record of seven total wins. Van Dyk won the Marathon's men's wheelchair division from 2001 through 2006. Wakako Tsuchida won the women's wheelchair division with an unofficial time of 1:43:29. The two wins were Japan's first in the wheelchair divisions. 

The weather was of some concern due to the fact a &lt;a href="w%3ANor%27easter"&gt;Nor'easter&lt;/a&gt; pounded the area the night before that forecasters were predicting to interfere with the race. However, by morning the weather was calm with a temperature of 52 degrees Fahrenheit and some moderate rain leaving the road slick along with some stiff winds at starting line in &lt;a href="w%3AHopkinton%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Hopkinton&lt;/a&gt;. However, the sun made an appearance during the race. However, the winds did slow down the runners somewhat. Others did not turn up at all, Marathon officials reported that 2,449 of 23,903 registered runners did not pick up their bibs.

Local inspirational icons, &lt;a href="w%3ATeam%20Hoyt"&gt;Team Hoyt&lt;/a&gt;, made up of Dick and Rick Hoyt did not take part, due to the fact, Rick Hoyt, who was diagnosed with cerebral palsy at birth could not compete as he was recovering from surgery and a infection in his hip.

The Marathon winners receive $100,000 USD as first prize and a olive wreath.

Reports produced by the &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; secret services reveal that they knew that &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; was planning attacks on the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; at least eight months before the &lt;a href="w%3A9/11"&gt;9/11&lt;/a&gt; attacks and that the attack was going to involve U.S. jetliners, the French newspaper ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALe%20Monde"&gt;Le Monde&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reports. 

♡❤Le Monde♡❤ also says one of the reports was handed to Bill Murray, a &lt;a href="w%3ACIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; agent working at the &lt;a href="w%3AParis"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; station at the time, but no record of that handover has been released in the U.S. governments &lt;a href="w%3A9/11%20commission"&gt;9/11 commission&lt;/a&gt; report in 2004.

"[The French government knew of a] plan to hijack an aircraft by Islamic radicals," said the report, adding the planned attack had been discussed by al-Qaeda, &lt;a href="w%3ATaliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AIslamic%20Movement%20of%20Uzbekistan"&gt;Uzbek militants&lt;/a&gt; in 2000. However; the ♡❤Washington Post♡❤ and ♡❤The Daily times♡❤ mistakenly say that the Uzbeck militants were &lt;a href="w%3AChechen%20people"&gt;Chechen&lt;/a&gt;.

According to the reports, al-Qaeda was planning to launch the 9/11 attack in March or September in 2000, but that the attack was delayed because of "differences of opinion, particularly over the date, objective and participants."

"You have to remember that a plane hijack (in January 2001) did not have the same significance as it did after September 11. At the time, it implied forcing a plane to land at an airport and undertaking negotiations," said Pierre-Antoine Lorenzi.

The CIA said that the report does not show that the U.S. or France had advance knowledge that an attack was going to take place.

"Today's Le Monde article merely repeats what the U.S. government knew and reported before September 11 that al Qaeda was interested in airliner plots, especially hijackings. The article does not suggest that U.S. or foreign officials had advance knowledge of the details surrounding the September 11 plot. Had the details been known, the U.S. government would have acted on them," a spokesman for the CIA, George Little, said.

&lt;a href="w%3AYom%20HaShoa"&gt;Yom HaShoa&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Holocaust"&gt;Holocaust&lt;/a&gt; Memorial Day was marked in &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; yesterday.

In Israel, a two-minute siren brought life to a standstill at 10 a.m. as Israelis observed an annual moment of silence in remembrance of the victims of the Nazis and their collaborators. Pedestrians stood, buses and cars pulled over on streets. 

The sirens were followed by services at the &lt;a href="w%3AKnesset"&gt;Knesset&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AYad%20Vashem"&gt;Yad Vashem&lt;/a&gt; Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Authority. At the Knesset, Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AEhud%20Olmert"&gt;Ehud Olmert&lt;/a&gt; read the names of the members of the Richter family, relatives of his wife Aliza who were killed in the Holocaust whilst &lt;a href="w%3ABenjamin%20Netanyahu"&gt;Benjamin Netanyahu&lt;/a&gt;, opposition leader, read the names of his wife Sara's relatives. Vice Prime Minister, &lt;a href="w%3AShimon%20Peres"&gt;Shimon Peres&lt;/a&gt; spoke of losing his grandfather, whilst Social Affairs Minister &lt;a href="w%3AIsaac%20Herzog"&gt;Isaac Herzog&lt;/a&gt; spoke of his father's cousin who was caught trying to cross the French border and was sent to &lt;a href="w%3AAuschwitz"&gt;Auschwitz&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, memorial services were held throughout the day at all schools and institutions.

<h2>Virginia Tech Shootings</h2>

The spirit of the day was further saddened late on in the day with the news that Professor &lt;a href="w%3ALiviu%20Librescu"&gt;Liviu Librescu&lt;/a&gt;, an Israeli Holocaust Survivor was killed in the &lt;a href="w%3AVirginia%20Tech%20massacre"&gt;Virginia Tech massacre&lt;/a&gt;. It was reported that he was murdered while holding off the gunman at his lecture hall entrance so his students could escape through the window.

<h2>Trial of Jose Padilla under way in Florida</h2>

The trial of &lt;a href="w%3AJose%20Padilla"&gt;Jose Padilla&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; citizen accused of assisting &lt;a href="w%3AIslamist%20terrorism"&gt;Islamist extremists&lt;/a&gt; and conspiracy to commit murder, is underway in Florida. Padilla denies the charges laid against him. 

Allegations that Padilla was involved in a &lt;a href="w%3Adirty%20bomb"&gt;dirty bomb&lt;/a&gt; plot, made when he was arrested, will not form part of the trial. Two others, Adham Amin Hassoun and Kifah Wael Jayyousi also face charges alongside Padilla.

&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20district%20court"&gt;U.S. District Judge&lt;/a&gt; Marcia Cooke has told prosecutors that they cannot refer to the &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%2C%202001%20attacks"&gt;September 11, 2001 attacks&lt;/a&gt;, to which Padilla is not linked in the charges framed, in a way that suggests guilt by association.

<h2>China mine explosion traps 33 underground</h2>

An explosion in a coal mine in Baofeng county, &lt;a href="w%3AHenan"&gt;Henan&lt;/a&gt; province in &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; has trapped 33 miners underground.

Chinese state media reports that a second explosion hampered rescue attempts that had begun. Rescue efforts are also hampered as the mine owner and the mine manager fled the site, leaving rescuers with a lack of accurate data about the mine. Police have frozen the owner's bank accounts and are tracking him down.

In another incident, a coal mine pit in &lt;a href="w%3AZhuzhou"&gt;Zhuzhou&lt;/a&gt; city flooded, trapping twelve miners.

A third incident occurred in &lt;a href="w%3AHeilongjiang"&gt;Heilongjiang province&lt;/a&gt; where at least two miners were trapped after an illegal coal mine collapsed, ♡❤Xinhua♡❤ said.

These incident come less than a year after the China pledged to improve mine safety. More than 4,700 coal miners died in accidents last year and the toll for the first three months of this year is 661.

<h2>Excessive bacon bad for lungs, says academic study</h2>

A study conducted by &lt;a href="w%3AColumbia%20University"&gt;Columbia University&lt;/a&gt; has found that an increased risk of lung disease could result from consumption of large amounts bacon and other cured meats. Researchers cited additives called &lt;a href="w%3ANitrite"&gt;nitrites&lt;/a&gt; as a possible cause.

The findings, published in the ♡❤American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine♡❤,
indicate that Columbia team found an increased risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in
those that had consumed cured meats at least 14 times in a month.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Meat%20Institute"&gt;American Meat Institute&lt;/a&gt; said the findings used outdated assumptions about nitrite levels in cured meats.

<h2>E-mail circulating UK Holocaust denial in schools is a hoax</h2>

According to a &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; report, various &lt;a href="w%3AChain%20e-mail"&gt;chain e-mails&lt;/a&gt; and rumours have been circulated on the internet indicating that the &lt;a href="UK"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; has ceased teaching details of the &lt;a href="w%3AHolocaust"&gt;Holocaust&lt;/a&gt; to avoid upsetting religious groups who deny its occurrence.

The rumour appears to originate from reports about one school in the North of England where the Holocaust was avoided to avoid offending &lt;a href="w%3AIslam"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; students who may be presented with a different picture of history both at home and in their place of worship.

A recent study into teaching indicated that many teachers were uncomfortable covering topics where students may have been exposed to an inaccurate historical account at home, however teaching the details of the Holocaust is required in England. Teaching of the topic is not mandatory in other parts of the UK.

A spokesperson for the UK government confirmed that teaching of the Holocaust is already compulsory in schools at &lt;a href="w%3AKey%20Stage%203"&gt;Key Stage 3&lt;/a&gt; (ages 11 to 14) and that it will remain so in the new KS3 &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Curriculum"&gt;curriculum&lt;/a&gt; from September 2008.

The e-mail is circulating as the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; is considering criminalizing denying or trivialising the Holocaust.

<h2>U.S. web broadcasters face steep royalty increases</h2>

A coalition of &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; web broadcasters, led by &lt;a href="National%20Public%20Radio"&gt;National Public Radio&lt;/a&gt; and including &lt;a href="Yahoo%21"&gt;Yahoo!&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="AOL"&gt;AOL&lt;/a&gt;, has claimed that new royalty arrangements could prove 'fatal' to the industry. The decision to increase royalties, which is due to be enforcible on May 15, came from the &lt;a href="w%3ACopyright%20Royalty%20Board"&gt;Copyright Royalty Board&lt;/a&gt;.

"If these rates stand", claimed blogger Kurt Hanson, who writes on the SaveInternetRadio.org, "I believe we will see a virtual shutdown of all U.S. webcasting. That will be bad for listeners, webcasters, musicians, and the record industry alike."

John Simson, executive director of &lt;a href="w%3ASoundExchange"&gt;SoundExchange&lt;/a&gt;, the not-for-profit organization that collects the royalties, said "Our artists and labels look forward to working with the Internet Radio industry - large and small, commercial and non-commercial - so that together we can ensure it succeeds as a place where great music is available to music lovers of all genres."

<h2>Trial in Italy begins for US soldier</h2>

The ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3Ain%20abstentia"&gt;in abstentia&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ trial of &lt;a href="w%3AMario%20Lozano"&gt;Mario Lozano&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; soldier, began today in a courtroom inside &lt;a href="w%3ARome"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt;'s maximum security prison ♡❤Rebibbia♡❤ in &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;. He stands accused in the death of &lt;a href="w%3ANicola%20Calipari"&gt;Nicola Calipari&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="w%3ASISMI"&gt;Italian intelligence&lt;/a&gt; officer who was shot to death during the &lt;a href="w%3ARescue%20of%20Giuliana%20Sgrena"&gt;rescue of Giuliana Sgrena&lt;/a&gt; in 2005.

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; has ruled out handing him over and his lawyer says his client could formally reject the Italian court's authority. Both the US and Italy have classified the shooting was an accident. Nevertheless, an Italian judge charged Lozano with murder and two counts of attempted murder of those in the car.

For journalist &lt;a href="w%3AGiuliana%20Sgrena"&gt;Giuliana Sgrena&lt;/a&gt;, the freed hostage, the trial shows that US troops can be held accountable for their actions, outside of US military jurisdiction. Sgrena was wounded in the shooting and is separately suing for damages.

On April 16 &lt;a href="w%3AItch%C5%8D%20It%C5%8D"&gt;Itchō Itō&lt;/a&gt;, 61, mayor of &lt;a href="w%3ANagasaki"&gt;Nagasaki City&lt;/a&gt;, was shot two times in the back. Mayor Itō died at 2:28 a.m. at the &lt;a href="w%3ANagasaki%20University"&gt;Nagasaki University Hospital&lt;/a&gt;. 

Itō was shot by a man yesterday in front of his campaign office just across from the JR Nagasaki train station. One bullet hit his heart, sending him into cardiac arrest. The attack occurred around 7:50 p.m. local time in Nagasaki.

Authorities believe that organized crime is behind the shooting. Immediately after the shooting, police arrested on the crime scene Tetsuya Shiroo, 59, a deputy-leader of the underground organized crime unit, Suishin-kai, and senior member of &lt;a href="w%3AYamaguchi-gumi"&gt;Yamaguchi-gumi&lt;/a&gt;. 

He reportedly had trouble with the city for failure to compensate for an accident that had occurred a few years ago in which his car had been damaged at a construction site operated by the city's public works department. Police say that during an interrogation Shiroo confessed to the shooting and his intent to kill Itō.

Itō is the fifth politician to be shot in &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; since World War II; a rare occurrence, because gun ownership is banned in Japan.

♡❤Tampa Bay leads series 2-1. (Best of Seven)♡❤

After losing the playoff opener, the Tampa Bay Lightning have won two straight, to take the series lead, two games to one. Both teams did very well both on the attack and in their own zone at the &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Pete%20Times%20Forum"&gt;St. Pete Times Forum&lt;/a&gt; in Tampa, Florida Monday night. 

&lt;a href="w%3AVincent%20Lecavalier"&gt;Vincent Lecavalier&lt;/a&gt; would be the first to score midway through the first period, on a sharp angle to put the Lightning up 1-0. &lt;a href="w%3AJohan%20Holmqvist"&gt;Johan Holmqvist&lt;/a&gt; would shutout the Devils though the entire first period but &lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20Brodeur"&gt;Martin Brodeur&lt;/a&gt; would return the favor as he would shutout the Lightning throughout the second period. The Devils did rebound from the 1-0 score as &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Madden"&gt;John Madden&lt;/a&gt; would score in the dying seconds of the second period to make the game 1-1. In the third period, as it was tied 1-1, &lt;a href="w%3ABrad%20Richards"&gt;Brad Richards&lt;/a&gt; would score very early on and put the Lightning up, yet again, at 2-1. Shortly after the &lt;a href="w%3ABrad%20Richards"&gt;Brad Richards&lt;/a&gt; goal, the Devils would counter with a goal of their own as &lt;a href="w%3AZach%20Parise"&gt;Zach Parise&lt;/a&gt; scored to tie the game once more at 2-2. In the end &lt;a href="w%3ATampa%20Bay"&gt;Tampa Bay&lt;/a&gt; would be victorious as &lt;a href="w%3AVaclav%20Prospal"&gt;Vaclav Prospal&lt;/a&gt; scored the game winner late in the third. 

Jersey goaltender Martin Brodeur needs to play better if he wants his team to advance, as he has given up a unusually high three goals in all three games of the series. The next game in the series is scheduled for Wednesday, April 18th, at 7:00 PM EST in &lt;a href="w%3ATampa%2C%20Florida"&gt;Tampa Bay&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Africa%20national%20cricket%20team"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; beat &lt;a href="w%3AEngland%20cricket%20team"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; by 9 wickets in the Super 8 phase of the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Cricket%20World%20Cup"&gt;World Cup&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AKensington%20Oval"&gt;Kensington Oval&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABridgetown"&gt;Bridgetown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABarbados"&gt;Barbados&lt;/a&gt;. This confirms South Africa's place in one of the four Semi-Final places in the tournament, and eliminates both England and hosts West Indies.

After losing both opening batsmen in quick succession, with Pietersen falling soon after, England were looking to rebuild steadily with Strauss and Collingwood at the crease. After hitting their 50-partnership in 80 balls, both men fell one after another inside 2 overs.

Flintoff was quickly dispatched by a &lt;a href="w%3AFast_bowling%23Reverse_swing"&gt;reverse-swinging&lt;/a&gt; delivery from Andrew Hall that went in between bat and body to take out the top of &lt;a href="w%3AStump_%2528cricket%2529%23Part_of_the_wicket"&gt;middle-stump&lt;/a&gt;. Two overs later and Nixon fell for 1 on the last ball of the 36th over, followed by Mahmood being bowled on the first delivery of Hall's next over leaving him on a &lt;a href="w%3AHat-trick%23Cricket"&gt;hat-trick&lt;/a&gt;, which he narrowly missed achieving after a wild swing by Monty Panesar just missed the ball, but went on to fly in to &lt;a href="w%3AWicket-keeper"&gt;wicket-keeper&lt;/a&gt; Boucher's hands.

Boucher caught Panesar off of the bowling of Nel following a poor shot, and Hall went on to bowl Anderson out to get his first &lt;a href="w%3AOne-Day%20International"&gt;ODI&lt;/a&gt; five-wicket haul (taking the wickets of Collingwood, Flintoff, Nixon, Mahmood and Anderson), the third of the competition (after fellow South Africans Charl Langeveldt's and Andre Nel's ), to finish with figures of 5-18 (10) - the best by a South African in a World Cup, beating &lt;a href="w%3ALance%20Klusener"&gt;Lance Klusener's&lt;/a&gt; 5-21 against Kenya in 1999. Andrew Strauss top scored for England with 46 and Bopara added precious runs at the tail end of England's innings with 27*, in a similar fashion to his 52 .

South Africa started batting in emphatic fashion: reaching 50 in just 5.4 overs: in contrast, England had taken 15.1 overs to reach 50; and while de Villiers was lucky not to be out on just 21 after being caught behind by Nixon off of the bowling of Anderson, (it was an edge so faint that the umpire, Steve Bucknor, couldn't hear it and couldn't give it), South Africa kept the foot on the gas and even after losing de Villiers on 42 they kept the run rate around 8, resulting in Smith getting 50 off of just 34 deliveries with only 9 dot balls, finishing on 85*. Kallis got to 17*, including getting his 9000th ODI run - a feat only 10 players have achieved.

The shooter in the &lt;a href="w%3AVirginia%20Tech%20massacre"&gt;Virginia Tech university shootings&lt;/a&gt; has been identified as &lt;a href="w%3ACho%20Seung-Hui"&gt;Cho Seung-Hui&lt;/a&gt;, a 23-year old &lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;n national. He was studying English and lived on the university campus. Meanwhile, a list of confirmed deceased has been released. 

The President of Virginia Tech, Charles Steger said in an interview that the "possibility exists" that more than one gunman was involved. "It appears that the second shooter was a resident in our dormitory... it appears he was an on-campus resident," Steger said. Ballistic reports confirm that the same gun was used in both instances of the campus shootings, but police could not confirm if the shooter was the same.
The shootings on Monday were in two separate locations, and occurred two hours apart. The first took place at 07:15 (12:15 UTC), at &lt;a href="w%3AVirginia%20Tech%20campus"&gt;West Ambler Johnston Hall dormitory&lt;/a&gt;. Then, at about 09:15 (14:15 UTC), 30 people were killed in the second shooting, about half a mile (800 metres) from the first at the &lt;a href="w%3AVirginia%20Tech%20campus"&gt;Norris Hall classroom building&lt;/a&gt;, on the same campus. Bodies were found in four classrooms and a stairwell, according to Virginia state police superintendent Col. Steve Flaherty.

Some students complained that they had received no warning from the university until an e-mail alert sent more than two hours after the first incident. The university has suspended classroom courses for one week, and Norris Hall will remain closed for the rest of the semester. University officials have expressed an interest in developing a text messaging alert system where persons can add their phone number to a list for notification in the event that incidents may warrant the use of caution or extra attention.

In a reaction to the school massacre, the gun control group &lt;a href="w%3ABrady%20Campaign"&gt;Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence&lt;/a&gt; asks for "common-sense actions to prevent tragedies like this from continuing to occur". The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Times"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; ran an editorial with a similar message for &lt;a href="w%3AGun%20politics"&gt;gun control&lt;/a&gt;.

<h3>Alleged lover's quarrel at West Ambler Johnston Hall dormitory</h3>
A Virginia Tech student, Chen Chia-hao, told the &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;ese station CTI TV that he believed the shooter in the West Ambler Johnston Hall was a &lt;a href="China"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; student. The first victim was, according to Chen, his girlfriend. Chen said: "They had a big quarrel in the West Ambler Johnston Hall and he shot her. Then the RA (dormitory supervisor) came, and he shot the RA."

According to Chen, the gunman locked up 25 students who were taking a German class in the Norris Hall building. The man then shot himself in the head, making it difficult for him to be identified, Chen told CTI TV.

<h3>Witness reports from the Norris Hall classroom building</h3>

First-year student Erin Sheehan was one of the only 4 students coming out of the shooting in the German class unharmed. Erin explained how "(The gunman) peeked in twice, earlier in the lesson, like he was looking for someone, somebody, before he started shooting."

The gunman first shot German lecturer Christopher James Bishop in the head. Then, he fired some 30 shots in the class and went on. Trey Perkins and two other students decided to hold the heavy wooden classroom door shut with their feet.

Erin Sheehan explain how they heard "something like drilling in the walls", and how they closed the doors to prevent anyone from entering the classroom. Three times the gunman returned and fired in the door, while the students tried to keep him out. Erin describes how "He seemed very thorough about it, getting almost everyone down. I was trying to act dead. He left for about 30 seconds, came back in, did almost exactly the same thing." Trey Perkins explained how "Fortunately, we were lying down and weren't in front of the door."

In a nearby classroom, students decided to jump from the second floor through the window, and ran for safety to a nearby window.

Students are asked not to come on campus, and classes have been cancelled until 5 PM. This is according to a public relations officer for the school and the St. Edwards web site. The message on the website reads,

Around noon police had completed an evacuation, secured the campus and begun searching buildings. As police completed the search of dormitory buildings, students were being allowed to return. University spokesperson, Mischelle Amador, indicated that the precautions taken were in no way related to or influenced by yesterday's Virginia Tech shootings.

♡❤Buffalo leads series 2-1. (Best of Seven)♡❤

The Buffalo Sabres defeated the New York Islanders Monday night to take a 2-1 lead in the best-of-seven series in the opening round of the NHL Playoffs. Despite being rattled by a puck to the face mask in the first, Buffalo goaltender &lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Miller%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;Ryan Miller&lt;/a&gt; put up respectable numbers, saving 20 of 22 shots faced. 

After a scoreless first period, &lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20Mair"&gt;Adam Mair&lt;/a&gt;, at 5:17, scored the first goal for the Sabres, taking a cross-ice pass from &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Drury"&gt;Chris Drury&lt;/a&gt;, beating Islanders goaltender &lt;a href="w%3ARick%20DiPietro"&gt;Rick DiPietro&lt;/a&gt; on the stick side. &lt;a href="w%3AThomas%20Vanek"&gt;Thomas Vanek&lt;/a&gt; would double the Sabres' lead, pushing the puck past DiPietro's glove side that was initially ruled no good, before being reviewed Trent Hunter would answer for the Islanders less than a minute and a half later, picking up a rebound off of &lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Smyth"&gt;Ryan Smyth's&lt;/a&gt; shot. Just over three minutes later, at 12:56 in the second period, with the Sabres on the power play, &lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Bri%C3%A8re"&gt;Daniel Briere&lt;/a&gt; would lead the shot barrage, finally beating DiPietro to score his first goal of the postseason. With eight seconds remaining in the second, &lt;a href="w%3ARandy%20Robitaille"&gt;Randy Robitaille&lt;/a&gt; would fake a shot from the left side before moving behind the cage, passing the puck to Ryan Smyth, who was parked in front of Buffalo netminder Ryan Miller. Smyth would score to narrow the Sabres' lead to one. However, the Sabres seized and kept control of the third period, outshooting the Islanders 17-2 over the final 20 minutes while protecting their one-goal lead. 

Despite losing the game, the Islanders are still very much alive in the Eastern Conference Quarterfinals. They will try to knot the series up at two games apiece on Wednesday, when New York will host the Buffalo Sabres once again.

The &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; province of &lt;a href="w%3AOntario"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt; may use a new system to elect its &lt;a href="w%3AMembers%20of%20Provincial%20Parliament"&gt;Members of Provincial Parliament&lt;/a&gt; (MPP) starting in 2011. A binding &lt;a href="w%3Areferendum"&gt;referendum&lt;/a&gt; on the question is to occur during the &lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20general%20election%2C%202007"&gt;general elections&lt;/a&gt; on October 10 this year.

The &lt;a href="w%3ACitizens%27%20Assembly%20on%20Electoral%20Reform%20%28Ontario%29"&gt;Citizens' Assembly on Electoral Reform&lt;/a&gt; recommended on May 15, 2007 that Ontario will switch to &lt;a href="w%3AMixed%20member%20proportional%20representation"&gt;Mixed member proportional representation&lt;/a&gt; (MMPR).

Under MMPR, Ontario's 107-seat legislature would be replaced with one with 129 seats. Of these, 90 would be elected from ridings under the existing &lt;a href="w%3Afirst%20past%20the%20post"&gt;first past the post&lt;/a&gt; (FPTP) system. The remaining 39, however, would be "list members" (not associated with specific regions) publicly nominated in advance by parties and assigned so that each party's total representation was in proportion to its share of the popular vote. It will also ask Ontario voters on election day whether they want to vote for the party or vote for the candidate. If someone votes for the party, they are still voting for the candidate which keeps the current electorial system unchanged.

Proponents say the system will be fairer to minor parties. Critics say it would be too complicated for most voters to learn to use.

&lt;a href="Manchester%20United"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt; opened a temporary six-point lead over &lt;a href="Chelsea%20F.C."&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday with a 2-0 victory over &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASheffield%20United"&gt;Sheffield United&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The Blades are stuck in the relegation battle in the league, having only jumped out of the bottom three this past weeking after a 3-0 thumping of fellow strugglers &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Ham"&gt;West Ham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The Red Devils on the other hand came into the game on a two game winning streak, having scored 11 goals in those two matches. Man United started with the same striking pair used in the last two games in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWayne%20Rooney"&gt;Wayne Rooney&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and Alan Smith. Sheffield United boss Neil Warnock played Colin Kazim-Richards up front with Luton Shelton, who was earning his first start, on the attack.

The first chance of the match fell to the Yorkshire side as a free Kick by Tonge was driven low, but lacked the power to beat Reds keeper, Tomasz Kuszczak. The Premiership leaders quickly made the Blades pay, and on 4 minutes, Michael Carrick received a pass from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACristiano%20Ronaldo"&gt;Cristiano Ronaldo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and chipped the ball over the sprawling Paddy Kenny. Wayne Rooney then had a chance to double the Red Devils lead, but his shot lacked power and Kenny patted the ball away. Another free kick was taken by Tonge for the Blades, and this one packed more power, but Kuszczak sprawled to make the stop. Patrice Evra then had to be substituted for the Reds when he took a high challenge from Kazim-Richards, and was replaced by Keiron Richardson. Smith was then forced to change his shorts after being caught by Matthew Kilgallon. Luton Shelton continued to make an impact for Sheffield United as he blasted a shot just wide.

After the break, Rooney again had a chance to double United's lead, but he was stopped by a well timed tackle from Chris Morgan. Shelton meanwhile caused unrest in the Man United defence with strong runs, but no goals came of them. Rooney finally scored his goal on 5 minutes when his run was met by Ryan Giggs' pass, and the young Englishman blasted the ball far side on Kenny. Shelton again threatened as he turned away from Wes Brown, but he then scooped the ball over the bar. Danny Webber then had a chance for the Blades after beating out Heinze, but he raked his shot wide. Kenny was then forced into action to make saves off both Ronaldo and Rooney, to keep the game at a respectable scoreline. Shelton then had a legitimate claim for a penalty when he was brought down by Heinze in the area, but referee Rob Styles waved play on. The decision all but ended the Blades hopes of a comeback, but they still continued to press as Tonge hit the post with a curling shot. Kuszczak kept his clean sheat, however, and the Red Devils earned a valuable three points in the title race.

Manchester United's next match will be another Premiership game against Middlesbrough at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOld%20Trafford"&gt;Old Trafford&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Sheffield United's next, also in the Premiership, will be against main relegation rivals Charlton Athletic, and that match will be very important for both teams.

&lt;a href="w%3ABell%20Canada"&gt;Bell Canada Enterprises&lt;/a&gt; (BCE), one of Canada's largest telecommunications companies, announced Tuesday that it is in talks with a consortium of Canadian pension funds to explore the possible sale of the company.

If successful in their bid, the consortium would take the publicly-traded company private, which would mean an end to the trading of BCE shares on the &lt;a href="w%3AToronto%20Stock%20Exchange"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt; (TSX: BCE), &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Stock%20Exchange"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; (NYSE: BCE) and the &lt;a href="w%3ASWX%20Swiss%20Exchange"&gt;Swiss&lt;/a&gt; (SWX: BCE) stock exchanges. BCE is one of the most widely held stocks in Canada. 

BCE revealed that the potential takeover group includes the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, the &lt;a href="w%3ACaisse%20de%20d%C3%A9p%C3%B4t%20et%20placement%20du%20Qu%C3%A9bec"&gt;Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec&lt;/a&gt;, and Canada's Public Sector Pension Investment Board. Each of the pension funds involved have signed &lt;a href="w%3ANon-disclosure%20agreement"&gt;non-disclosure&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AStandstill%20Agreement"&gt;standstill&lt;/a&gt; agreements with BCE. It was also revealed that New York-based private equity firm &lt;a href="w%3AKohlberg%20Kravis%20Roberts"&gt;Kohlberg Kravis Roberts&lt;/a&gt; (KKR) would join the Canadian-led consortium as a minority partner.

"We are pleased to be a partner with this consortium of leading Canadian institutional fund managers and look forward to working closely together in this transaction." said Henry Kravis, co-founding member of KKR. "Our experience in large, complex transactions of comparable size will be of significant value to this process," continued Kravis.

BCE is also leaving the door open to rival bids, "taking into consideration the need to meet all legislative and regulatory requirements, including ensuring the Company remains Canadian to meet existing foreign ownership restrictions," the company stated. In addition, BCE may retain the status quo if it does not receive a bid that it feels would enhance shareholder value.

One other pension fund that has expressed interest is the &lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20Teachers%27%20Pension%20Plan"&gt;Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan&lt;/a&gt; (OTPP). "We are pleased that this process is not exclusive and we will continue to review our options, including leading an alternative Canadian consortium," said Jim Leech, Senior Vice-President, Teachers' Private Capital. OTPP is currently BCE’s largest single shareholder, with an approximate ownership stake of 5.3 percent.

BCE, as Bell Canada, has been in business for 127 years. It provides phone service, satellite television, Internet access, wireless services, and other technologies to residential and business customers.

If analyst estimates are accurate, the sale of BCE could be worth about CA$32 billion or roughly $40 per share. On Tuesday, BCE shares were up CA$2.34 to close at $38.60 on the TSX, and up US$2.03 to close at $34.10 on the NYSE.

An Internet outage in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; has left tens of thousands of people without Internet access for over five hours after a planned upgrade crashed &lt;a href="w%3ATelecom%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Telecom's&lt;/a&gt; servers.

Telecom, New Zealand's telecommunications monopolistic company, had planned for an upgrade to its network overnight but it didn't quite go to plan as their network crashed at around 4.00 a.m. (NZST) until around 11.00 a.m., when it was restored. Telecom has said that either customers lost their connection altogether, or could not access some websites.

The network outage also affected other ISP's who purchase their services off Telecom. &lt;a href="w%3AVodafone%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Vodafone's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aihug"&gt;ihug&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATelstraClear"&gt;TelstraClear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASlingshot%20%28ISP%29"&gt;Slingshot&lt;/a&gt;, Callplus, &lt;a href="w%3AQuicksilver%20%28ISP%29"&gt;Quicksilver&lt;/a&gt;, MaxNet, &lt;a href="w%3AWoosh"&gt;Woosh&lt;/a&gt;, World Exchange, ICONZ, and, of course, &lt;a href="w%3AXtra%20%28ISP%29"&gt;Xtra&lt;/a&gt; were all the affected ISPs.

Another network outage, again, left broadband subscribers without Internet for around 20 minutes, from 11.20 a.m. to 11.40 a.m..

The outage affected international and national websites, and e-mail services of both residential and some corporate customers.

Telecom says that they are still investigating the full reason for why the outage occurred, but they do know it was related to a problem with a broadband router in Auckland.

Spokesperson, Sarah Berry has said that Telecom will consider compensation case by case for affected customers.

Some people still had limited Internet access though, including &lt;a href="w%3AWikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt; reporter, Gabriel Pollard. Gabriel Pollard has said that he was able to access his Gmail account, some pages of Wikinews, and some pages would start to load but never finish. He described it as "painfully slow." Mr Pollard says that it took a while to log onto his work e-mail as their TelstraClear Internet connection wasn't working.

The network is still being monitored for any other problems that may arise.

<h1>Electronic voting disputed in France</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Electronic%20voting%20disputed%20in%20France&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

In &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, put a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating their candidate of choice into an envelope. After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting roll. French electoral law rather strictly codifies the proceedings. Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that no envelopes are present at the start of the vote and that no envelopes are added except those of the duly counted and authorized voters. Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under heavy supervision, following specific procedures.

In the past, &lt;a href="w%3Avoting%20machine"&gt;voting machine&lt;/a&gt;s, though authorized by law, were scarce. But this year, during &lt;a href="w%3AFrance%27s%20presidential%20elections%2C%202007"&gt;presidential elections&lt;/a&gt; (the first round was April 22, the second is on May 6), the country is shaken by controversy about the machines intended to count about 1.5 million votes.

As in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, there is a group of academic computer scientists that oppose voting machines. They argue that voting machines replace a public, easily understandable counting process, where large-scale fraud would entail large-scale corruption, by an opaque process where votes are counted by machines that voters have to blindly trust. Voting machines have to be approved by the &lt;a href="w%3AMinister%20of%20the%20Interior%20%28France%29"&gt;Ministry of the Interior&lt;/a&gt;, but this approval is based on confidential reports by private companies. Opponents to the machines point out that the Ministry was long held by &lt;a href="w%3ANicolas%20Sarkozy"&gt;Nicolas Sarkozy&lt;/a&gt;, who happens to be the leading candidate. Opponents also list a number of weaknesses and discrepancies that have occurred in other countries using voting machines.

All main political parties except &lt;a href="w%3AUnion%20for%20a%20Popular%20Movement"&gt;UMP&lt;/a&gt;, Mr Sarkozy's ruling party, oppose the voting machines. Some citizens have filed for court injunctions against the voting machines. Opponents have given detailed instructions that voting witnesses should check whether the machines correspond exactly to an approved type, including &lt;a href="w%3Asoftware"&gt;software&lt;/a&gt; versions, and fulfill all legal conditions. In a sign of the frenzy over the issue, on April 12 the Ministry of the Interior issued a last-minute authorization for a specific model (&lt;a href="w%3Ahardware"&gt;hardware&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Afirmware"&gt;firmware&lt;/a&gt;). The stakes are high: votes on unapproved machines should be canceled by the &lt;a href="w%3AConstitutional%20Council%20of%20France"&gt;Constitutional Council&lt;/a&gt; for the official count.

The opposition has crystallized on the Paris suburb of &lt;a href="w%3AIssy-les-Moulineaux"&gt;Issy-les-Moulineaux&lt;/a&gt;. Issy's mayor, &lt;a href="w%3AAndr%C3%A9%20Santini"&gt;André Santini&lt;/a&gt; is a well-known technophile; his city organizes a "World E-Gov Forum". Here too, last minute fixes are at work. The machines delivered to the city are of a yet-to-be-approved type. The manufacturer, the American company &lt;a href="w%3AES%26amp%3BS"&gt;ES&amp;S voting systems&lt;/a&gt;, is now delivering older 2005 machines. ♡❤Le Monde♡❤ reports that other municipalities have already replaced their recent machines by an older, approved, model.

Proponents of the machines, such as the French company France Élection, claim they are being defamed and dispute the competence of their critics. Elected officials supporting the machines claim the machines save on paper, time, and the need to find volunteers to count votes.

<h3>Virginia Tech was warned about gunman Cho</h3>

A former professor at Virginia Tech has said that she informed the university authorities about &lt;a href="w%3ACho%20Seung-hui"&gt;Cho Seung-hui&lt;/a&gt; and his unusual behaviour in 2005.

Lucinda Roy claims that after Cho wrote a disturbing piece for an English class, she "was so uncomfortable that I didn't feel that I could leave him in the classroom." Roy also indicates that she felt the repeated warnings that she gave concerning Cho should have been considered more seriously.

<h3>Nigeria begins 'evacuation' of militants</h3>

There are reports that the &lt;a href="w%3ANigeria"&gt;Nigerian&lt;/a&gt; Army has clashed with militants. The army has begun an operation to remove militants from &lt;a href="w%3AKano"&gt;Kano&lt;/a&gt; in the north of the country.

According to police the militants, who have been linked with Islamic extremists, may have been in the area because an Islamic cleric was assassinated last week.

The unrest comes days after a number of political parties in Nigeria called for postponement of Nigeria's presidential election and a boycott of the poll over its integrity.

<h3>Brewing Cartel? - Not here says EU</h3>

The European Union has imposed fines on brewers in the Netherlands totaling at least 273 million euros for price fixing and alleged anti-competitive behavior.

Whilst not record, the fines are intended to send a clear message that cartel-like behavior would not be tolerated in the EU.

EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes was quoted as saying "The highest management of these companies knew very well that their behavior was illegal, but they went ahead anyway and tried to cover their tracks", indicating that senior management in the firms had done little to stop the behavior.

Combating price-fixing and cartels remains a priority of EU Competition Commission authorities; 1.7 billion euros in related fines have already been issued this year.

Natural Balance Pet Foods has recalled some of its wet and dry food for cats and dogs after several owners said that their pets were becoming sick. The company urges owners to stop feeding their pets the food immediately.

The brands recalled include Venison &amp; Brown Rice Dry Dog Food and Venison &amp; Green Pea Dry Cat Food.

Last month, &lt;a href="w%3AMenu%20Foods"&gt;Menu Foods&lt;/a&gt; recalled all of its 60 million products of dry and wet dog and cat food after pets began to fall ill and in some cases died of kidney failure.

"Natural Balance, Pacoima, CA, is issuing a voluntary nationwide recall for all of its Venison dog products and the dry Venison cat food only, regardless of date codes. The recalled products include Venison and Brown Rice canned and bagged dog foods, Venison and Brown Rice dog treats, and Venison and Green Pea dry cat food. Recent laboratory results show that the products contain &lt;a href="w%3AMelamine"&gt;melamine&lt;/a&gt;. We believe the source of the melamine is a rice protein concentrate. Natural Balance has confirmed this morning that some production batches of these products may contain melamine," said a press released issued by Natural Balance.

The &lt;a href="w%3AFDA"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt; states that the "investigation remains open and active, and the agency continues to follow leads to get closer to the root cause of the problem and to ensure that all contaminated product is removed from the market."

"The source of the melamine appears to be a rice protein concentrate, which was recently added to the dry venison formulas. Natural Balance does not use wheat gluten, which was associated with the previous melamine contamination," said the press release.

Bags, cans and zip lock bags of the food are expected to be the most affected.

"The products are packaged in bags, cans and zip lock treat bags and sold in pet specialty stores and PetCo nationally. No other Natural Balance products are involved in this voluntary recall as none of our other formulas include the rice protein concentrate," added the press release.

The company states that the food, Venison &amp; Brown Rice Dry Dog Food and Venison &amp; Green Pea Dry Cat Food, are the only brands affected by the recall.

&lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;'s Chief of General Staff, General &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AYa%C5%9Far%20B%C3%BCy%C3%BCkan%C4%B1t"&gt;Yaşar Büyükanıt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , proposed that &lt;a href="Greece"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; and Turkish fighters should fly unarmed flights over the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAegean"&gt;Aegean&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . This follows reports that Greek and Turkish fighters held mock dogfights during &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; President &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVladimir%20Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's visit to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAthens"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; last month.

Greek Foreign Ministry spokesman Giorgos Koumoutsakos said that Turkish planes were in the air at the time but denied any effort to confront Greek fighters.

Gen. Büyükanıt is in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThessaloniki"&gt;Thessaloniki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , northern Greece, where the Conference of the Balkan countries Chiefs of Army Staff takes place, and met his Greek counterpart, Admiral &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APanayiotis%20Chinofotis"&gt;Panayiotis Chinofotis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Greece's Minister of National Defence &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEvangelos%20Meimarakis"&gt;Evangelos Meimarakis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; this morning declared open the Conference which takes place in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThermi"&gt;Thermi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a suburb in eastern Thessaloniki. As Meimarakis said during his opening speech, the dialogue among Balkan countries is very significant; characteristically saying that a dialogue builds bridges.

Gen. Büyükanıt's visit in Greece is his first in the country, after he became chief of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATurkish%20Army%20Forces"&gt;Turkish Army Forces&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . According to Turkish officials, Gen. Büyükanıt will visit the Turkish Consulate of Thessaloniki which is regarded as the birthplace house of &lt;a href="Kemal%20Ataturk"&gt;Kemal Ataturk&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="Ayatollah%20Khamenei"&gt;Ayatollah Khamenei&lt;/a&gt;, Iran's supreme leader and commander-in-chief of the military, met with army personnel and their families on April 18, the Day of Army of the &lt;a href="w%3AIslamic%20Republic%20of%20Iran"&gt;Islamic Republic of Iran&lt;/a&gt;. 

He blasted the military of the previous regime as one without spirituality, saying, "the defunct regime (of &lt;a href="w%3AMohammad%20Reza%20Pahlavi"&gt;Shah Pahlavi&lt;/a&gt;), which was backed by &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;America&lt;/a&gt; and other superpowers, amassed all its efforts on building an army of irreligious and unpopular identity. Nevertheless, following the &lt;a href="w%3AIslamic%20Revolution"&gt;Islamic Revolution&lt;/a&gt;, the Army picked a religious identity."

Khamenei then went on to pay tribute to several &lt;a href="w%3Amartyr"&gt;martyrs&lt;/a&gt; and former army commanders by stating that these men played pivotal roles in shaping the religious identity of the army. Finally, he exhorted the army to modernize and obtain sophisticated military technology through utilization of the nation's own resources.

In the same vein, Iranian President &lt;a href="Mahmoud%20Ahmadinejad"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt; stressed that Iran would rely upon &lt;a href="w%3AGod"&gt;God&lt;/a&gt; and advised major powers to "return to the path of God's prophets".

&lt;a href="w%3ATehran%20Times"&gt;Tehran Times&lt;/a&gt; also reported that Khamenei glorified the "&lt;a href="w%3Areligious%20democracy"&gt;religious democracy&lt;/a&gt;" and "anti-hegemonistic character" of Iran.

♡❤Ottawa leads series 3-1. (Best of Seven)♡❤

The &lt;a href="w%3APittsburgh%20Penguins"&gt;Pittsburgh Penguins&lt;/a&gt; fell to the &lt;a href="w%3AOttawa%20Senators"&gt;Ottawa Senators&lt;/a&gt; in Game 4 of the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Stanley%20Cup%20Playoffs"&gt;Stanley Cup Playoffs&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3AMellon%20Arena"&gt;Mellon Arena&lt;/a&gt;, Tuesday night. This was not an elimination game, but surely a must win game for the Pens and they simply fell short. 

In the first period the Penguins were down early as an odd hanging puck found its way down into the net to put the Pens down 1-0. Jordan Staal, sacrificing his body in a block, knocked the puck through the air and into the net above Fleury's helmet. Though it looked like &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Neil"&gt;Chris Neil&lt;/a&gt; had slapped it down and in, the goal was credited to &lt;a href="w%3AJason%20Spezza"&gt;Jason Spezza&lt;/a&gt;, who had shot the puck into Staal. After review, it was clear that Neil had not touched the puck on it's way down. In the second period, the Pens rebounded with a goal of their own as &lt;a href="w%3AJordan%20Staal"&gt;Jordan Staal&lt;/a&gt; scored while tied up in a pile around the goal to tie the game 1-1. Midway through the third &lt;a href="w%3AAnton%20Volchenkov"&gt;Anton Volchenkov&lt;/a&gt; scored the game winner to put the Sens up 2-1 in the game and 3-1 in the series. 

Both clubs played a strong game, making for an exciting atmosphere for the 17,132 in the arena. However, the problem for the Pens, as it has been through the playoffs, is the lack of shots on goal. &lt;a href="w%3ARay%20Emery"&gt;Ray Emery&lt;/a&gt; faced only 11 shots in both the first and third period combined, yet in just the second period he faced 13 shots and the Penguins scored. Pittsburgh's only chance to come back in the series is to increase the number of shots on goal. All the Senators need do is win one more game and the series is theirs. 

The next game for these two clubs will be Thursday, April 19 at seven p.m. in &lt;a href="w%3AOttawa"&gt;Ottawa&lt;/a&gt;. The Penguinss must win this game in order to evade elimination.

The 5-4 vote reflected the change in vote count resulting from the retirement of &lt;a href="w%3ASandra%20Day%20O%27Connor"&gt;Justice O'Connor&lt;/a&gt; and the confirmation of &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Roberts"&gt;Chief Justice Roberts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASamuel%20Alito"&gt;Justice Alito&lt;/a&gt;.
The &lt;a href="w%3AIntact%20dilation%20and%20extraction"&gt;Intact dilation and extraction&lt;/a&gt; procedure, also known as partial birth abortion, involves removing an intact late-term fetus from the womb via the cervix. While it is a relatively rare operation - 0.17% of all abortions in the US in 2000, it has become a focal point in the &lt;a href="w%3Aabortion%20debate"&gt;abortion debate&lt;/a&gt;.

The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act bans the procedure in cases where the fetus is terminated during the operation, unless it is performed to to save the life of the mother.

&lt;a href="w%3AAnthony%20Kennedy"&gt;Justice Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; wrote in the opinion of the court: "respondents have not demonstrated that the Act would be unconstitutional in a large fraction of relevant cases." Further, he said, "Respondents have not demonstrated that the Act, as a facial matter, is void for vagueness, or that it imposes an undue burden on a woman’s right to abortion based on its overbreadth or lack of a health exception. For these reasons the judgments of the Courts of Appeals for the Eighth and Ninth Circuits are reversed."
In a concurring opinion, &lt;a href="w%3AClarence%20Thomas"&gt;Justice Thomas&lt;/a&gt; stated that he joins "the Court’s opinion because it accurately applies current jurisprudence, including Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833 (1992)."

In dissent &lt;a href="w%3ARuth%20Bader%20Ginsburg"&gt;Judge Ginsburg&lt;/a&gt; wrote: "Today’s decision is alarming. It refuses to take Casey and Stenberg seriously. It tolerates, indeed applauds, federal intervention to ban nationwide a procedure found necessary and proper in certain cases by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists."
Justice Kennedy's words also recall the complicated issues of standing related to such cases. An issue in &lt;a href="w%3ARoe%20v.%20Wade"&gt;Roe v. Wade&lt;/a&gt; was the impossibility of any individual having standing in a court proceeding regarding abortion rights, since court proceedings take more than the 9 months of pregnancy, retiring any individual plaintiff's standing before an appeals process can take place. The criterion of "a large fraction of relevant cases" may effectively deny standing to any plaintiffs who wish to litigate particular restrictions in some relevant future cases.

♡❤Detroit leads series 2-1. (Best of Seven)♡❤
Two power play goals helped lead the Calgary Flames to a 3-2 victory over the Detroit Red Wings on Tuesday. The Red Wings went into the match with a 2-0 lead in the best of seven series, and Calgary needed to win at home to give themselves of advancing.

The first period went by without any goals, but Calgary opened the scoring 9:20 into the second period on the power play as Matthew Lombardi scored, and Alex Tanguay and David Moss earned assists. Kris Draper then evened the scoring only two minutes later, with the only assist being credited to Daniel Cleary.

Draper was again on the scoresheet at the beginning of the third, with Cleary again assisting, as he put the Red Wings into the lead. An interference penalty to Matthew Schneider of the Red Wings then gave the Flames a power play, and Mark Giordano capitalized as his unassisted marker tied the game at two a piece. Jarome Iginla then scored the winning goal for the Flames at 9:21 of the third, with assists going to Wayne Primeau and Tony Amonte.

♡❤NY Rangers lead series 3-0. (Best of Seven)♡❤

The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Rangers"&gt;New York Rangers&lt;/a&gt; annihilated the &lt;a href="w%3AAtlanta%20Thrashers"&gt;Atlanta Thrashers&lt;/a&gt; Monday night, burying pucks in the back of the goal the entire game with &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Nylander"&gt;Michael Nylander&lt;/a&gt; leading the way. Nylander scored the first &lt;a href="w%3Ahat%20trick"&gt;hat trick&lt;/a&gt; of the postseason, scoring the opening goal, as well as the final, as the &lt;a href="w%3ARangers"&gt;Rangers&lt;/a&gt; to a dominated the &lt;a href="w%3AAtlanta%20Thrashers"&gt;Atlanta Thrashers&lt;/a&gt;, 7-0.

&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Nylander"&gt;Nylander&lt;/a&gt; scored his first of what would be three goals 0:32 into regulation, beating &lt;a href="w%3AKari%20Lehtonen"&gt;Kari Lehtonen&lt;/a&gt;, who was just barraged with pucks the entire night. &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Nylander"&gt;Nylander's&lt;/a&gt; first goal would prove to be the game winner, but the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Rangers"&gt;Rangers&lt;/a&gt; were determined to pad their lead. &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Nylander"&gt;Nylander&lt;/a&gt; scored his second of the game 9:13 later to double the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Rangers"&gt;Rangers&lt;/a&gt; lead. After four more scores, &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Nylander"&gt;Nylander&lt;/a&gt; would cap the game off at 15:54 to complete the &lt;a href="w%3AAtlanta%20Thrashers"&gt;Thrashers'&lt;/a&gt; embarrassing loss.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAtlanta%20Thrashers"&gt;Atlanta Thrashers&lt;/a&gt;, down three games, will try to stop their skid, and the sweep of the opening round series Wednesday night, when they will travel to &lt;a href="w%3AMadison%20Square%20Garden"&gt;Madison Square Garden&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; to battle the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Rangers"&gt;Rangers&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps for the last time.

FC Internazionale Milano must wait for the Serie A Scudetto after a 1&amp;ndash;3 home defeat against &lt;a href="AS%20Roma"&gt;AS Roma&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Serie%20A"&gt;Serie A&lt;/a&gt;. The loss is the first Inter have suffered this season, and it came at a very unfortunate time. With a win, Inter could have sealed the league title for themselves, breaking the record for clinched title with most games remaining. The loss, however, means that Inter will attempt to tie the record of five games remaining next Sunday against Siena. 

Roma started well and took the lead after 44 minutes through Simone Perrotta. Inter equalized in the 52th minute when Adriano earned a soft penalty, and Marco Materazzi scored from the spot. In the 88th minute, Roma captain Francesco Totti scored a freekick goal after a deflection off Luis Figo in the wall. Roma sealed the win only a minute later through Marco Cassetti.

Though mathematically Roma could still win the league, the reality of the situation is that Inter will seal the league title easily within the five remaining games. The win does help Roma secure their spot for next seasons Champion's League, however, where they will be hoping to put in a better showing than they did this past season. 

Roma's next match is also on Sunday, as they take on tenth place Atalanta.

"This may be a very new, critical component of this investigation. We're in the process right now of attempting to analyze and evaluate its worth," said superintendent of &lt;a href="w%3AVirginia%20State%20Police"&gt;Virginia State Police&lt;/a&gt; Colonel Steve Flaherty.

The package, which contained a &lt;a href="w%3ADVD"&gt;DVD&lt;/a&gt;, allegedly contained "rants against rich people" and "warns that he wants to get even".

"[The package contained a] rambling, manifesto-like statement embedded with a series of photographs" and the material was "hard-to-follow ... disturbing, very disturbing — very angry, profanity-laced," said &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Capus"&gt;Steve Capus&lt;/a&gt;, the president of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANBC%20News"&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

At least 23 videos are reported to be inside the package, in a &lt;a href="w%3AQuickTime"&gt;QuickTime&lt;/a&gt; format, where Cho speaks about religion and how he hates rich people. No specific names were mentioned in the video. The pictures of Cho show him holding both guns believed to have been used in the shootings, and in some cases he is leaning against a white wall. There are also pictures of him showing hollowed out bullets and holding a knife. It is not known where the pictures or videos were taken.

No images of the either of the two shootings were inside the package, but it did include "vague references" to the shootings and asserted that "things like this didn’t have to happen," added Capus, who also said that the package had an incorrect address and &lt;a href="w%3AZIP%20code"&gt;ZIP code&lt;/a&gt;.

All of the material that Cho sent to ♡❤NBC♡❤ was immediately handed over to the &lt;a href="w%3AFBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; by ♡❤NBC♡❤ security guards wearing gloves for further analysis.

♡❤NBC♡❤ plans to air some of the material on ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANBC%20Nightly%20News"&gt;NBC Nightly News&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ on Friday. However, the video is also being discussed on NBC's 24-hour news channel, &lt;a href="w%3AMSNBC"&gt;MSNBC&lt;/a&gt;.

Researchers call the extinct tree a Wattieza and this particular tree stood over 30 feet tall and used spores to reproduce rather than seeds. It may have even looked like many palms trees that exist today, but did not have any leaves. Instead they had fronds much like a &lt;a href="w%3Afern"&gt;fern&lt;/a&gt;.

"These were very big trees. Our reconstruction shows them to be a lot longer and much more treelike than any of the reconstructions before. I don’t think any of us dared think of them being quite that big," said paleobotanist at the &lt;a href="w%3AState%20University%20of%20New%20York%20at%20Binghamton"&gt;State University of New York at Binghamton&lt;/a&gt;, and one of the researchers who studied the tree, William Stein.

Over 130 years ago in 1870, the same kind of trees, but only the stumps, were also found in Gilboa after flood waters caused the stumps to be exposed. A few decades later in the 1920s, another set of stumps were found in the same area.

In 2004, the researchers found a top to one of the trees that weighed almost 400 pounds not too far from Gilboa.

Researchers say that these trees likely shaped the forests of Earth as we see them today, and that the trees existed long before dinosaurs were roaming the planet.

"In forming the first forests, they must have really changed the Earth system as a whole, creating new types of micro-environments for smaller plants and insects, storing large amounts of carbon and binding the soil together. The rise of forests removed a lot of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This caused temperatures to drop and the planet became very similar to its present-day conditions," said the leader of the research team, Christopher Berry.

Wattiezas were most common during the &lt;a href="w%3ADevonian"&gt;Devonian period&lt;/a&gt; and existed on the planet before fish evolved sufficiently to leave the seas.

Molten steel spilled out and killed 32 workers at the Qinghe Special Steel Corporation mill in the city of &lt;a href="w%3ATieling"&gt;Tieling&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ALiaoning"&gt;Liaoning&lt;/a&gt; province, &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;.

The ladle containing 1,500-degree-Celsius liquid steel &lt;a href="w%3AQinghe%20Special%20Steel%20Corporation%20disaster"&gt;poured into an open room&lt;/a&gt;, where employees take breaks in-between shift changes, at 7:45 a.m. local time. At least 6 others were injured, one of them critically.
"It is the most serious accident to hit China's steel industry since 1949," said China's deputy head of the State Administration of Work Safety, Sun Huashan.

At least 4 workers have been arrested after the accident. The manager of mill, an operator, technician and a supervisor of a workshop were all arrested and are being questioned as an investigation in launched into what caused the accident to occur.

Three people are dead after five "brothers" attacked employees at the Bible publishing firm Zirve Publishing House in &lt;a href="w%3AMalatya"&gt;Malatya, Turkey&lt;/a&gt;. Two of the victims were &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt; and the other was &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt;.

The employees had their throats slashed and were tied up at the hands and ankles according to police.

Later after the attack, four men were arrested. One was being treated for serious wounds when he attempted to jump out of a window when police went to chase him. All of the alleged killers are between 19 and 20 years old.

According to police, the "five brothers" carried a letter saying "We are going to our deaths."

"[I condemn the attacks] in the strongest terms.[We will] do everything to clear up this crime completely and bring those responsible to justice," said &lt;a href="w%3AFrank-Walter%20Steinmeier"&gt;Frank-Walter Steinmeier&lt;/a&gt;, the German Foreign Minister.

"This is savagery," said &lt;a href="w%3ARecep%20Tayyip%20Erdo%C4%9Fan"&gt;Recep Tayyip Erdoğan&lt;/a&gt;, the Turkish Prime Minister.

Protests were taking place at the firm recently after the firm was accused of "proselytizing" a Muslim nation, but it is not known if the murders are related to the protests.

The names of the victims or suspects have not been released.

<h3>Compensation sought for New Zealand's Internet outage</h3>

Wikinews reported previously on an Internet outage in New Zealand that lasted for over five hours. &lt;a href="w%3ATelecom%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Telecom New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, the company that owns and operates the "local loop", said that they will review compensation for its customers on a case-by-case basis.

A wholesale ISP is attempting to give its subscribers compensation for the outage. CallPlus says that it is asking Telecom for the thousands of dollars it needs to pass on to its affected customers. They doubt Telecom will give them the money needed.

<h3>Peruvian farmers issue warning to government</h3>

Farmers in &lt;a href="Peru"&gt;Peru&lt;/a&gt; striking over the Peruvian government's stance on &lt;a href="w%3ACoca"&gt;coca&lt;/a&gt;, have issued an ultimatum. The ultimatum appears to be: negotiate within 24 hours, or face roadblocks indefinitely.

The protests come in response to a coca eradication drive and measures Peruvian president &lt;a href="w%3AAlan%20Garc%C3%ADa"&gt;Alan García&lt;/a&gt; is taking against &lt;a href="w%3ACocaine"&gt;cocaine&lt;/a&gt; production in the country.

Peruvian police have arrested the leader of the &lt;a href="w%3AShining%20Path"&gt;Shining Path&lt;/a&gt; rebel group, Jimmy Rodríguez on charges of organising anti-government protests.

<h3>Missile shield to feature in talks</h3>

Meetings are underway at &lt;a href="w%3ANATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; headquarters in an attempt to reassure &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20missile%20defense"&gt;missile defence plans&lt;/a&gt; pose no threat. The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; maintains the system is to protect against missiles from rogue states, whereas Russia sees the system as compromising its strategic interests in the region.

In today's talks NATO allies encouraged the United States to make the planned anti-missile shield capable of covering all of Europe. They did this without committing themselves to joining the project.

Reaction to the proposed system in European states has been mixed.

<h3>Water cuts possible as Australia faces drought</h3>

Irrigation water to a substantial proportion of Australia's farming regions could be cut due to drought conditions, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n PM &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; has warned.

Mr Howard's comments concerned the &lt;a href="w%3AMurray-Darling%20Basin"&gt;Murray-Darling Basin&lt;/a&gt;, one of the largest systems in Australia. "If it doesn't rain in sufficient volume over the next six to eight weeks, there will be no water allocations for irrigation purposes in the basin", adding that the drought conditions could continue until May 2008.

He continued "It is a grim situation, and there is no point in pretending to Australia otherwise," he said. "We must all hope and pray there is rain."

<h3>Russian plans for Bering Strait tunnel received with skepticism</h3>
&lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, in coordination with the government of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, is planning to build a tunnel from Russia to &lt;a href="w%3AAlaska"&gt;Alaska&lt;/a&gt;, Viktor Razbegin, deputy head of industrial research at the Russian Economy Ministry, told reporters in Moscow Wednesday. 

The tunnel is budgeted to cost US$65 billion and would take 10 to 15 years to build. The tunnel is to provide train and automobile transport between Alaska and the &lt;a href="w%3ARussian%20Far%20East"&gt;Russian Far East&lt;/a&gt;, and to carry &lt;a href="w%3Apetroleum"&gt;petroleum&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Anatural%20gas"&gt;natural gas&lt;/a&gt; pipelines, and &lt;a href="w%3Aelectric%20power%20transmission"&gt;high-voltage electrical cable&lt;/a&gt;. 

The proposed tunnel is 64 miles long, or about 100 kilometers, in total, and is designed to link with two islands in the &lt;a href="w%3ABering%20Strait"&gt;Bering Strait&lt;/a&gt;. The project is expected to have a very positive economic effect in the area.

Derek Brower, an energy market expert, called the project "absurd" and suggested the Russian government is playing political games to threaten its &lt;a href="w%3AEurope"&gt;European&lt;/a&gt; customers to sign energy deals.

"I've never heard of this plan," said Sergei Grigoryev, Vice President of oil pipeline monopoly &lt;a href="w%3ATransneft"&gt;Transneft&lt;/a&gt;.

"To be honest, anyone who look[s] at the map will realize that the project is too hard to implement," an anonymous government source told ♡❤Reuters♡❤.

In &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad%2C%20Iraq"&gt;Baghdad, Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, conflicting reports say that 5 to 11 people were killed and 10 to 28 others were wounded when a suicide bomber in a car drove into a fuel truck in the downtown Baghdad district of Karradah, but CNN reports that the blast occurred in the Baghdad district of Jadriya.

The blast happened at approximately 1:15 p.m. local time in Baghdad and reports say that the death toll is higher.

Yesterday, nearly 200 people were killed in a series of bombings in Baghdad.

&lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Indies%20cricket%20team"&gt;West Indies&lt;/a&gt; have beaten &lt;a href="w%3ABangladesh%20national%20cricket%20team"&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt; by 99 runs in the Super 8 stage of the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Cricket%20World%20Cup"&gt;World Cup&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AKensington%20Oval"&gt;Kensington Oval&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABridgetown"&gt;Bridgetown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABarbados"&gt;Barbados&lt;/a&gt;. Both teams had already failed to qualify for the semi-final stage of the tournament before today's match. Bangladesh's World Cup is now over, while West Indies have one match remaining against England on April 21. 

West Indies stumbled to 55/3 after a slow start, losing Gayle and Smith cheaply with &lt;a href="w%3AShivnarine%20Chanderpaul"&gt;Shivnarine Chanderpaul&lt;/a&gt; scoring 50 off 85 balls. They had only reached 67-3 at the half-way point of their innings, restricted by some tight bowling from seamers &lt;a href="w%3AMashrafe%20Mortaza"&gt;Mashrafe Mortaza&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASyed%20Rasel"&gt;Syed Rasel&lt;/a&gt;. However &lt;a href="w%3ARamnaresh%20Sarwan"&gt;Ramnaresh Sarwan&lt;/a&gt; (91 not out), &lt;a href="w%3ABrian%20Lara"&gt;Brian Lara&lt;/a&gt; (33) and &lt;a href="w%3AMarlon%20Samuels"&gt;Marlon Samuels&lt;/a&gt; (31) salvaged a respectable total of 230 for the hosts. 230 is the lowest score that a opening batting team has won with in this world cup(Zimbabwe-Ireland had a tie at 221), previous low
was 235 for Sri Lanka against England.

Bangladesh found scoring against West Indies' pace bowling attack difficult and were bowled out for just 131 after 43.5 overs. &lt;a href="w%3ADaren%20Powell"&gt;Daren Powell&lt;/a&gt; was the pick of the bowlers, taking 3/38 off 10 overs, while &lt;a href="w%3ACorey%20Collymore"&gt;Corey Collymore&lt;/a&gt; took 2/11 and both &lt;a href="w%3ADwayne%20Bravo"&gt;Dwayne Bravo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Gayle"&gt;Chris Gayle&lt;/a&gt; finished with 2/28.

Andrew Burris, from Curtis, Ohio, and member of Carpenters Local 1138, died in &lt;a href="w%3AToledo%2C%20Ohio"&gt;Toledo, Ohio&lt;/a&gt; when the construction platform he was on fell around 9:15 a.m. EST. The platform was attached to the northbound side of the &lt;a href="w%3AVeterans%27%20Glass%20City%20Skyway"&gt;Veterans' Glass City Skyway&lt;/a&gt;, a new bridge on Interstate 280. The platform was clamped to the side of the bridge, and broke off. Burris fell about 95 feet to the ground, where he landed on the east side of the roadway. Authorities from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration do not know why the platform broke free from the bridge. The Toledo Police department does not suspect foul play, and considers the death to be accidental. The $220 million bridge is scheduled for opening in June, 2007, and is the largest construction project in the history of Ohio. 

"On behalf of Director Beasley and the &lt;a href="w%3AOhio%20Department%20of%20Transportation"&gt;Ohio Department of Transportation&lt;/a&gt;, we extend our deepest sympathy to the family of Andrew Burris," said ODOT District 2 director, Dave Dysard. "We also extend our condolences to his relatives, friends and his fellow workers who have made us proud through their commitment and dedication to their work. Andrew was a part of the team that took the pylon to the top back in 2005. For four-and-a-half years, he was an integral part of the team that worked to complete this vital link for our community."

This is the second fatal accident on the bridge. On Presidents' Day in 2004, five workers were killed and four were injured when a crane collapsed. 

Mr. Burris was from a line of carpenters, and kept a scrapbook of the project. His mother, Ruth, was quoted as saying "I think he felt closer to heaven there."

Wednesday, a &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; soldier died in a non-combat related incident after falling from a communications tower in &lt;a href="w%3AAfghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;.

"It was not operationally related at this time. It was simply, unfortunately an accident," Col. Mike Cessford said. "I would stress that we take every precaution to minimize the dangers to our soldiers. However, risk is inherent in the nature of the work that we do."

The soldier's name will not be released until the other relatives have been notified due to the family's request.

This is the first non-combat related incident in &lt;a href="w%3AKandahar"&gt;Kandahar&lt;/a&gt;. Most Canadian forces are based at &lt;a href="w%3AKandahar%20Airfield"&gt;Kandahar Airfield&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Security%20Assistance%20Force"&gt;International Security Assistance Force&lt;/a&gt;.

Most Canadian soldiers' deaths were in bomb attacks and/or during combat. Fifty-four Canadian soldiers have died in Afghanistan since the mission began in 2002.

For the past week, approximately 100 &lt;a href="w%3ASeal%20hunting"&gt;sealing&lt;/a&gt; ships have been trapped in ice floes off the northeast coast of &lt;a href="w%3ANewfoundland%20and%20Labrador"&gt;Newfoundland&lt;/a&gt;. The ships and their crew had been participating in the annual seal hunt off &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;'s easternmost province.

Several of the vessels have been damaged by the ice and supplies are now running low for those sailors awaiting rescue by the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Coast%20Guard"&gt;Canadian Coast Guard&lt;/a&gt;. As of Thursday, 6:00 p.m. EDST, some 20 crew members, out of an estimated 400, had been rescued.

A Coast Guard &lt;a href="w%3AIcebreaker"&gt;icebreaker&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3ACCGS%20Sir%20Wilfred%20Grenfell"&gt;Sir Wilfred Grenfell&lt;/a&gt;, on mission to free the trapped ships, itself became stuck in the ice. A &lt;a href="w%3AFisheries%20and%20Oceans%20Canada"&gt;Department of Fisheries and Oceans&lt;/a&gt; (DFO) spokesperson indicated to CTV News that, although the Grenfell had since been freed, another icebreaker, the Ann Harvey, was now trapped. "It's just such heavy ice that even ice breakers are having trouble," said Erika Pittman, a communications officer with the DFO. 

In addition to the crushing ice, extreme weather conditions have been hampering rescue efforts. Pittman suggested that conditions wouldn't improve until sometime next week. The amount and thickness of the pack ice, according to Pittman, is the worst it has been for sealers in the past 15 years.

In addition to three icebreakers on hand, the Coast Guard is flying helicopters in to provide food and support to the stranded sailors. Most of the sealing ship captains have refused to abandon their ships, instead staying with them and hoping for a change in conditions or to be freed by the Coast Guard.

"Usually you try to stay with the ship because you think the safety is with the ship because the ship is big, but sometimes it is too late. In this case, we're hoping that as it changes and the breakers and helicopters are there and we can get them all out," said Brian Penney, a superintendent with the Coast Guard.

"They're putting a lot of effort into pulling them out," said Penny. "But the sheer numbers, it's a very, very slow process." According to Penny, approximately 15 of the longliners ships have had their hulls damaged by the ice to the extent that the ships are at risk of sinking.

Critics of the seal hunt point out that the annual hunt is not only "cruel to animals", but is also a dangerous occupation for the sealers. When sealers have to be rescued by the Coast Guard, "Canadian taxpayers foot the bill," suggested Rebecca Aldworth, director of Canadian wildlife issues for the &lt;a href="w%3AHumane%20Society%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;Humane Society of the United States&lt;/a&gt;.

<h3>Iraq has fourth highest execution rate, says Amnesty</h3>

The human rights organisation &lt;a href="w%3AAmnesty%20International"&gt;Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt; says that &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; now ranks fourth in the list of countries with high execution rates.

Since mid 2004, Iraq has sentenced 270 people to death, at least 100 of whom have already been hanged. Amnesty says that Iraq's reintroduction of the &lt;a href="w%3Adeath%20sentence"&gt;death sentence&lt;/a&gt; goes against a general global trend for its abolition.

In a press release, Amnesty says many of the trials are unfair, criticising the use of televised pre-trial confessions and a failure to investigate allegations of torture. 

Kate Allen, Amnesty's UK director said: "The clock has been turned back in Iraq and we've seen a return to large numbers of people being condemned to death and hastily executed after unfair trials," 

The criticisms have been dismissed by Iraqi officials.

<h3>Canadian Conservatives regret participation in Sikh parade</h3>

The &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Conservatives&lt;/a&gt; have expressed regret for participating in a Sikh Parade in &lt;a href="w%3ASurrey%2C%20British%20Columbia"&gt;Surrey, British Columbia&lt;/a&gt; because a display of &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;Indian&lt;/a&gt; saints included &lt;a href="w%3ATalwinder%20Tarmar"&gt;Talwinder Tarmar&lt;/a&gt;, the terrorist that led the 1985 Air India bomb plot. The president of the temple that organized the parade claims that he is not guilty.

The first quake, a 6.0 magnitude, was reported at 9:26 a.m. local time (00:26 UTC), 165 km (105 miles) north, north east of Ishigaki-jima, in the &lt;a href="w%3ARyukyu%20Islands"&gt;Ryukyu Islands&lt;/a&gt; in Japan.

The second quake of 5.6 magnitude struck just five minutes after the first and a 6.1 magnitude quake struck just over an hour later, followed by a magnitude 5.9 about 15 minutes later.

Japan's weather agency says the first and last quakes were actually 6.7 magnitude.

Three smaller quakes ranging from 5.1 to 5.3 magnitudes shortly followed.

The tsunami warnings were issued only after Japan's weather agency said that an 18-inch (46cm) wave could be a possibility.

There are no reports of damage, injuries, deaths or tsunamis.

Iran's Supreme Court has nullified the death sentences awarded to several members of the &lt;a href="w%3ABasij"&gt;Basij&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAnsar-e%20Hezbollah"&gt;Ansar-e Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt; paramilitary groups for killing people they accused of moral corruption under Islamic laws.

Ali Maleki and several of his associates killed Reza Nejadmalayeri and Shohreh Nikpour in &lt;a href="w%3AKerm%C4%81n%20Province"&gt;Kerman&lt;/a&gt; in 2002, accusing them of &lt;a href="w%3Afornication"&gt;fornication&lt;/a&gt;. 

Iran's Islamic laws permit summary execution of those who commit blasphemy, sacrilege, repeated fornication, adultery, slander &lt;a href="w%3AImam%20Khomeini"&gt;Imam Khomeini&lt;/a&gt;, Grand Ayatollah &lt;a href="Ali%20Khamenei"&gt;Ali Khamenei&lt;/a&gt; or the Islamic prophets, and otherwise behave in a way that is out of sync with the Islamic criteria.

Members of the paramilitary group (Basij) - which is variously characterized as a pro-government vigilante group or militia - who had been convicted escaped the death penalty because they argued before the Islamic court that they acted in defense of Islamic laws. The members, who pledge allegiance to Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, &lt;a href="w%3Astoning"&gt;stoned&lt;/a&gt; one of their victims to death and tied up four others, including Nejadmalayeri and Nikpour, before throwing them into a swimming pool where they drowned.

The accused stated in their confession the teachings of one &lt;a href="w%3Aulema"&gt;Islamic cleric&lt;/a&gt; who had said that they were allowed to kill &lt;a href="w%3AMorality"&gt;immoral&lt;/a&gt; people if they had ignored two warnings to stop their bad behavior. 

In Iran, courts have previously imposed severe penalties for what they considered immoral behaviour. In 2004, a 16 year old girl, &lt;a href="w%3AAtefah%20Sahaaleh"&gt;Atefah Sahaaleh&lt;/a&gt;, was executed for committing "acts incompatible with chastity", after she testified that she had been repeatedly raped while in an abusive relationship with an ex-revolutionary guard, Ali Darabi. Dabari received a sentence of 95 lashes. In 1998 a German businessman, Helmut Hofer, was sentenced to death for having a relationship with a 26-year-old single Iranian woman.

An &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Air%20Force"&gt;RAF&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABAE%20Hawk"&gt;Hawk training jet&lt;/a&gt; has crashed at &lt;a href="w%3ARAF%20Mona"&gt;Mona Airfield&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="w%3AAnglesey%20Island"&gt;Anglesey Island&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. The crash occurred at 12:25 p.m. local time.

The pilot is reported to have ejected prior to the crash. No injuries are reported at this time.

"I can confirm that a Hawk aircraft has crashed at RAF Mona, which is a small satellite airfield connected to RAF Valley. One person was on board but we do not know the extent of the pilot's injuries at this time," said spokesman for RAF Valley, Squadron Leader Mark Byrne.

According to the &lt;a href="w%3AMinistry%20of%20Defence%20%28United%20Kingdom%29"&gt;U.K.'s Defense Ministry&lt;/a&gt;, the aircraft carries up to two pilots, but only one was on board the plane at the time of the crash.

The plane was put into service in 1976 for flying and weapons training. The T1 version of the Hawk is for training pilots in fast flying at an advanced level and the T1A Hawk is designed to train pilots to use weapons at an advanced level. It is also the aircraft used by the &lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Arrows"&gt;Red Arrows&lt;/a&gt; RAF display team.

Search and rescue personnel are on their way to the scene and an investigation is being launched. The wreckage of the plane is said to be in two pieces. It is not known what caused the crash.

"We will not speculate about the cause of the accident as an investigation will be carried out to establish what has happened," added Byrne.

All eight million users of &lt;a href="w%3ABlackBerry"&gt;BlackBerry&lt;/a&gt; have been relieved of a large system failure that left them without email for two days.

Emails were lost after a large system failure blocked all of their users worldwide, Tuesday. It is reported at 8 p.m. ET on Tuesday the system failure began. It ended Wednesday morning leaving its millions of users with a backlog of emails.

BlackBerry, owned by &lt;a href="w%3AWaterloo%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Waterloo, Ontario&lt;/a&gt; based &lt;a href="w%3AResearch%20In%20Motion%2C%20Inc."&gt;Research In Motion&lt;/a&gt; (RIM), apologised for the outage Wednesday and said they will take further measures to ensure this will never happen again.

Research In Motion said that a system upgrade caused the large system failure and when they tried to fix the problem "it did not fully perform to its expectations".

"It wasn't a capacity issue, it wasn't a security issue. It was an outage overnight when there was an upgrade," said Co-CEO of RIM, &lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Balsillie"&gt;Jim Balsillie&lt;/a&gt;. "I think it's pretty likely that the systems are in place that this kind of thing, as incredibly unlikely as it is to happen, is all the more unlikely to happen again."

Around 1:40 p.m. CDT, &lt;a href="NASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; employees reported that two shots were fired in the NASA Building 44 in the &lt;a href="w%3AJohnson%20Space%20Center"&gt;Johnson Space Center&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AHouston"&gt;Houston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href="w%3ASWAT"&gt;SWAT&lt;/a&gt; team later reported that Bill Phillips, a contract engineer with Jacobs Engineering, had killed David Beverly as well as himself, leaving a female hostage physically unharmed.

Phillips entered a conference room with gun drawn and ordered all but one person out. Phillips barricaded himself on the second floor of the two-story building, with David Beverly and another female hostage. The building was evacuated and police were summoned. NASA security, Houston police and a SWAT team were on the scene.

Houston news reported at 5:22 p.m. CDT that Bill Phillips, the gunman, and David Beverly, the hostage, were both dead. Police reported that the SWAT team heard one shot and decided to engage, but before they reached the room they heard another shot. When SWAT reached the scene, the male hostage was dead from a bullet to the chest, the gunman was dead from a bullet to the head, and the female hostage, Fran Cranshaw, was gagged and bound to a chair with duct tape, but was otherwise unharmed.

All NASA employees had first been warned to stay in their buildings but were later told by NASA they were free to go home if their working day was over. Mission Control locked its doors during this incident, as this is a standard procedure in such situations. No NASA Mission has been affected by this incident, according to NASA.

In the first press conference, police said that communication to the gunman had not yet been established, but that negotiators had already tried it two times unsuccessfully.

The motive of the hostage-taking, and whether the three people had any connection to each other, is currently under investigation. 

The Houston Chronicle reports that last month Phillips had received one e-mail from his employer, Jacob engineering Inc., "describing problems with his work and offering suggestions on improvement." Jacobs printed that e-mail on March 18, the same day he bought the 38-caliber gun that police suspect was used in the shooting. 

Despite reassurances by Cranshaw and Beverly, Phillips would not believe that management was not going to fire him, according to Cranshaw. During the 3-hour standoff, Phillips used a dry-erase board in the room indicating he was tired of being called "stupid," police said last Saturday. 

Michael Sampson, the co-manager of the space agency's Electronic Parts and Packaging Program, who had known Beverly for ten years, described him as friendly, peaceful person, with a positive attitude to his co-workers. 

Relatives describe Phillips as a loner who always kept to himself. He had lost his father in 2003, but had decided not to return to his hometown in Tennessee. Smith, a cousin of Phillips, remarked that in the Christmas card he had received from him last year, Phillips said that he was feeling lonely and without family, but nothing in the card suggested anything so tragic.

&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Vatican"&gt;The Vatican&lt;/a&gt; has abolished &lt;a href="w%3ALimbo"&gt;limbo&lt;/a&gt;, which, according to the &lt;a href="w%3ARoman%20Catholic"&gt;Roman Catholic&lt;/a&gt; belief, is a permanent status of the &lt;a href="w%3ABaptism"&gt;unbaptized&lt;/a&gt; who die in infancy, without having committed any personal sins, but without having been freed from original sin, or in some cases &lt;a href="w%3Aabortion"&gt;abortion&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3APope%20Benedict%20XVI"&gt;Pope Benedict XVI&lt;/a&gt;, a theologian, showed doubt about the concept of limbo. He cited his concerns about it when he was a &lt;a href="w%3ACardinal%20%28Catholicism%29"&gt;cardinal&lt;/a&gt;.

"The conclusion of this study is that there are theological and liturgical reasons to hope that infants who die without baptism may be saved and brought into eternal happiness even if there is not an explicit teaching on this question found in revelation," the 41-page document said. "There are reasons to hope that God will save these infants precisely because it was not possible (to baptise them)."

Baptism, in the Catholic Church, is a religious act of purification by water. Baptism removes &lt;a href="w%3Aoriginal%20sin"&gt;original sin&lt;/a&gt;. 

"People find it increasingly difficult to accept that God is just and merciful if he excludes infants, who have no personal sins, from eternal happiness, whether they are Christian or non-Christian."

The Church has never made limbo an official doctrine but most Catholics believe in it. The Church also concludes that baptism will stay and further states that it has nothing to do with the abolition of limbo.

&lt;a href="w%3AKent%20Hovind"&gt;Kent Hovind&lt;/a&gt;'s motion for acquittal was denied on Wednesday, April 18, 2007. Hovind, a Pensacola &lt;a href="w%3AYoung%20Earth%20creationism"&gt;young Earth creationist&lt;/a&gt; and operator of Dinosaur Adventure Land, along with his wife, Jo Hovind, were found guilty in November 2006 on 58 federal counts of "willful failure" to payroll taxes, structuring bank withdrawals, and obstructing federal agents.

On January 19, 2007 Kent was sentenced to ten years in prison and ordered to pay US$640,000 in owed funds to the &lt;a href="w%3AInternal%20Revenue%20Service"&gt;Internal Revenue Service&lt;/a&gt;, pay prosecution's court costs of $7,078, and serve three years parole once released.

In his motion, Hovind had contended that under the rule in a case called ♡❤United States v. Davenport♡❤ the crime is not the individual withdrawals, but is instead the total transaction, also known as the "unit of the crime." Thus, Hovind argued that in his case there was no "unit of the crime" "separate and distinct from the alleged act of withdrawing, and without such a separate amount to be structured [. . .] there could be no crime alleged, and no conviction on any charge in Counts 13 through 57." The trial court rejected Hovind's "unit of the crime" argument.

Had the judge ruled in Hovind's favor his sentence would have reduced Hovind's prison sentence from ten years to five years.

Jo Hovind sentencing was delayed pending the ruling on the motion. She will be sentenced soon though no date has been set.

This weekend sees the potentially ill-fated &lt;a href="w%3AHeineken%20Cup"&gt;Heineken Cup&lt;/a&gt; semi finals take place. &lt;a href="w%3ALlanelli%20Scarlets"&gt;Llanelli Scarlets&lt;/a&gt; are to play &lt;a href="w%3ALeicester%20Tigers"&gt;Leicester&lt;/a&gt;, and in a repeat of last week's Guinness premiership clash, &lt;a href="w%3ANorthampton%20Saints"&gt;Northampton Saints&lt;/a&gt; face &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Wasps"&gt;London Wasps&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Path to the Semis</h2>

<h3>Scarlets</h3>
The Scarlets are the last non-English side playing in the Heineken Cup, which is guaranteed to have at least one English team in the title. The Scarlets are the only unbeaten side remaining in the competition.

<h3>Leicester</h3>
Leicester arrive in the semi finals having knocked out the French side, Stade Francais. They are currently have 66 points in the premiership, which places them in second place after Gloucester (also on 66 points). Given that they've won the Anglo-Welsh trophy already, they have the potential to win the treble.

<h3>Northampton</h3>

In the Quarter Finals, Northampton played the French team, Biarritz. The game was played in the San Sebastien in northern Spain. After a low scoring game, Northampton defied predictions to win 7-6.

Northampton are facing relegation in the premiership, and although they will take the game seriously, it's possible that their minds may be elsewhere. It will be vital for them to win their next premiership game. Should they fail to do so they will certainly be relegated.

<h3>Wasps</h3>
Following Wasps victory over Leinster at Adams Park, Wasps fully expected to face Biarritz, but it was not to be. In an interesting twist, their Heineken Cup game against Northampton would immediately follow their Guinness Premiership match against that team. Wasps won that game, despite having to rest players such as Alex King and Lawrence Dallaglio.

Wasps have a good chance this weekend, and can boast three international captains in their ranks. Dallaglio, Vickery (both England) and Ibanez (captain of the French side which won the 6 nations).

<h2>Schedule</h2>

Both games take place at a neutral venue which has been selected by one of the sides previously selected by lot. The Leicester vs. Llanelli game will take place at the &lt;a href="w%3AWalkers%20stadium"&gt;Walkers stadium&lt;/a&gt; in Leicester on Saturday. It will kick off at 3pm BST (2pm UTC).

The Wasps vs. Northampton game will take place in Coventry at the &lt;a href="w%3ARicoh%20arena"&gt;Ricoh arena&lt;/a&gt;. It will kick off at 3:05pm BST on Sunday.

The final will take place at &lt;a href="w%3ATwickenham%20Stadium"&gt;Twickenham&lt;/a&gt; on the 20th May at 2:30pm (BST)

<h2>Results</h2>
In the &lt;a href="w%3ALlanelli%20Scarlets"&gt;Llanelli Scarlets&lt;/a&gt; vs &lt;a href="w%3ALeicester%20Tigers"&gt;Leicester&lt;/a&gt; game, Leicester won 33 points to 17. It was 16-10 at half time. Tries for leicester were scored by Goode, Jennings and Deacon. There were three conversions from Goode who also scored four penalties. For Scarlets, M Jones and Rees scored tries, S Jones converted twice and also scored a penalty.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANorthampton%20Saints"&gt;Northampton Saints&lt;/a&gt; face &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Wasps"&gt;London Wasps&lt;/a&gt; later today.

<h1>Pigs fed contaminated pet food; meat sold to consumers</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Pigs%20fed%20contaminated%20pet%20food%3B%20meat%20sold%20to%20consumers&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

At least seven urine samples taken from pigs at the American Hog Farm, were tested and the results came back positive for the chemical melamine. At least three samples from the feed used to feed the pigs were tested and those results also came back positive for melamine.

Reports say that at least 100 pigs from the farm were slaughtered and sold from the "custom slaughterhouse" that is operated on the farms site. The meat is then sold to different places as "individual orders" and is not sold commercially for supermarkets. The affected meat goes as far back as April 3 and the company is asking anyone who bought it to return the product or throw it out.

Despite the sale, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; State Veterinarian Dr. Richard Breitmeyer says that no evidence has turned up to suggest that the meat that was sold entered the human consumption chain.

"There is no evidence that any products from this farm have entered the food supply. The risk to people right now is minimal," said Breitmeyer who also said that pet food from bags or boxes that have been torn or ripped, is sometimes reused as feed for small farms.

California's Department of Food and Agriculture investigated the company and found that it had received the contaminated pet food from Diamond Pet Foods, which supplies retailers with the pet food Natural Balance, one of the over 100 recalled brands of pet food. Authorities then quarantined the farm to further investigate the situation.

At least 1,500 pigs are on the farm.

As of the moment, no other farms are being investigated, but officials say that other farms may also be affected.

"In the course of our investigation, we may find similar situations in other parts of the country," said head of the Center for Veterinary Medicine at the U.S. &lt;a href="w%3AFood%20and%20Drug%20Administration"&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt;, Stephen Sundlof.

The FDA is continuing to investigate and Sundlof says that there is a possibility that the contamination of the pet food may be intentional.

"It would certainly lend credibility to the theory that it may be intentional. That will be one of the theories we will pursue when we get into the plants in China," said Sundlof.

Last month, &lt;a href="w%3AMenu%20Foods"&gt;Menu Foods&lt;/a&gt; was the first to recall all of its 60 million products of dry and wet dog and cat food after pets began to fall ill and in some cases died of kidney failure. The FDA found melamine in samples of Menu Foods pet food and in samples of wheat gluten, imported from &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, which was used as an ingredient.

&lt;a href="w%3AEngland%20cricket%20team"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; have defeated the &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Indies%20cricket%20team"&gt;West Indies&lt;/a&gt; in the final game of the Super 8 phase of the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Cricket%20World%20Cup"&gt;World Cup&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AKensington%20Oval"&gt;Kensington Oval&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABridgetown"&gt;Bridgetown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABarbados"&gt;Barbados&lt;/a&gt;. The result decided little: England finished 5th in the Super 8s table, with the West Indies coming 6th.

The end of the match was tight with the result tipping in the balance for the last 5 overs. With just 3 overs left England needed 29 runs - looking unlikely to win the match, but &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Nixon"&gt;Paul Nixon&lt;/a&gt; stepped up and hit 13 off the next over, with another 4 coming from extras, to turn the match round; giving England the upper hand. Despite being bowled out by &lt;a href="w%3ADwayne%20Bravo"&gt;Dwayne Bravo&lt;/a&gt; - who had earlier been involved in the dismissal of 4 other English batsmen (two from run outs, two from bowling and taking one catch) - tail enders &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Anderson%20%28cricketer%29"&gt;Anderson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AStuart%20Broad"&gt;Broad&lt;/a&gt; gave England a tight 1 wicket win with just 1 ball remaining.

This was the last appearance for West Indies captain &lt;a href="w%3ABrian%20Lara"&gt;Brian Lara&lt;/a&gt; in international cricket: he has now retired from both &lt;a href="w%3ATest%20cricket"&gt;Test&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AOne-Day%20International"&gt;ODI&lt;/a&gt; cricket.

An &lt;a href="w%3AF/A-18%20Hornet"&gt;F/A-18 Hornet&lt;/a&gt; jet belonging to the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Navy"&gt;U.S. Navy&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ABlue%20Angels"&gt;Blue Angels&lt;/a&gt; squadron crashed in &lt;a href="w%3ABeaufort%2C%20South%20Carolina"&gt;Beaufort, South Carolina&lt;/a&gt; Saturday. The pilot was killed while flying during an air-show at &lt;a href="w%3AMarine%20Corps%20Air%20Station%20Beaufort"&gt;Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort&lt;/a&gt;. The jet crashed into a neighborhood, sending debris scattering. Eight injuries and property damage were also reported.

The crash occurred approximately three miles beyond the air station near Pine Grove and White Pine roads, in Beaufort.

According to a Navy news release, the Blue Angels were performing the final maneuver of their routine when the accident occurred. "It was [the pilot's] second year on the team, and first year as a demonstration pilot." said the Navy. "The other five Blue Angel jets were not involved in the incident."

The cause of the accident is under investigation, but no other jets are said to be involved. In a news conference, Lt. Commander Anthony Walley said "Our squadron, and the entire U.S. Navy, are grieving the loss of a great American, a great naval officer, and most of all, a great friend." The pilot's name has not officially been released, but it is believed to be Lt. Commander Kevin Davis, 32, from &lt;a href="w%3APittsfield%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Pittsfield, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;, as local media reports the number 6 jet was the one that crashed.

&lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Simonyi"&gt;Charles Simonyi&lt;/a&gt;, a billionaire software engineer born in &lt;a href="Hungary"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt;, has returned to &lt;a href="w%3AEarth"&gt;Earth&lt;/a&gt; after a 25 million dollar trip to the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Space%20Station"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt; with mission &lt;a href="w%3ASoyuz%20TMA-10"&gt;Soyuz TMA-10&lt;/a&gt;. The original mission, planned to last 13 days, was extended to 14 days when landing was made impossible due to "boggy ground". Mr. Simonyi, Russian cosmonaut &lt;a href="w%3AMikhail%20Tyurin"&gt;Mikhail Tyurin&lt;/a&gt;, and American astronaut &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Lopez-Alegria"&gt;Michael Lopez-Alegria&lt;/a&gt; made a successful landing in the &lt;a href="w%3ASoyuz%20TMA-9"&gt;Soyuz TMA-9&lt;/a&gt; spacecraft on the Kazakh steppe in Central Asia on Saturday.

Mr. Simonyi was said to be "ecstatic" after rescuers helped him from the capsule and into a fur-lined chair. His first piece of food back on Earth was an offering to returning space crews landing in &lt;a href="w%3AKazakstan"&gt;Kazakstan&lt;/a&gt; - a green &lt;a href="w%3Aapple"&gt;apple&lt;/a&gt;. The controllers supervising the landing burst into applause along with the families of the space crew as a giant screen displayed "It has landed!" in large red letters.

Simonyi commented "I feel terrific, it was a fantastic trip, it is good to be back," before relaxing in a special reclining chair. The two other returning men were said to be very tired after their 7-month visit to the ISS. "It is natural that those who spend a quite long period of time [in space] find it harder now," said &lt;a href="w%3AAnatoly%20Grigoryev"&gt;Anatoly Grigoryev&lt;/a&gt;, head of a Russian biomedical institute responsible for the health of the cosmonauts.

&lt;a href="w%3AMohammed%20el-Attar"&gt;Mohammed Essam Ghoneim el-Attar&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="Egypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;ian-&lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt;, was sentenced in an Egyptian court to 15 years in prison after being convicted of spying for &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;'s intelligence agency, &lt;a href="w%3AMossad"&gt;Mossad&lt;/a&gt;. In its ruling, the court stated: "He let himself be seduced by Satan, disregarding his country's values and selling himself and his country to the devil." Israel has dismissed the veracity of the case. Mark Regev, a spokesperson for Israel's foreign ministry called the case "a pity".

El-Attar was arrested in January of this year while traveling in Egypt. He has been on trial in Cairo since February 24. Egyptian prosecutors said he began spying for Israel in 2001 when he was living in Turkey. They allege that he used his position at a Canadian bank to spy on Egyptians and Arabs in Turkey and Canada and was paid $56,000 to do so. No appeal will be allowed; the conviction can only be overturned by Egypt's President.

The main evidence used against him was a confession that el-Attar signed after spending three weeks in detention, without access to legal counsel. El-Attar claims that the confession was extracted by torture. He said that authorities gave him electric shocks and forced him to drink his urine. Ibrahim Bassiouni, the defendant's Egyptian lawyer, told the newsmedia that there was "no concrete evidence against the defendant."

Officials from the Canadian Embassy who were at the trial, witnessed the sentencing and will review the verdict.

<h1>High turnout observed in French presidential election</h1>

As voting began in the first round of the &lt;a href="w%3AFrench%20presidential%20election%2C%202007"&gt;presidential elections&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; voters showed up at polling stations at a brisk pace on Sunday. The &lt;a href="w%3AMinister%20of%20the%20Interior%20%28France%29"&gt;Interior Ministry&lt;/a&gt; reported that by noon local time, turnout had reached 31.2%, a level not seen since 1981 and ten percent higher than the last election for &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20France"&gt;President of France&lt;/a&gt;.

Voting stations were to begin closing at 6:00 p.m., but those in large cities will be open until 8:00 p.m. Initial projections are expected to be published at that time, based on a partial count of votes from hundreds of stations around the country.

Romain Pinault, an election official at a school in &lt;a href="w%3AParis"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;' eighth district, told ♡❤&lt;a href="Associated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ a second voting station was added to handle the extra voters, "The participation rate [at this location] is about 30 percent more than five years ago."

&lt;a href="Nicolas%20Sarkozy"&gt;Nicolas Sarkozy&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnion%20for%20a%20Popular%20Movement"&gt;UMP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AS%C3%A9gol%C3%A8ne%20Royal"&gt;Ségolène Royal&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3ASocialist%20Party%20%28France%29"&gt;Socialist Party&lt;/a&gt; are considered the frontrunners. But the latest opinion polls suggested a third of the 44.5 million registered voters were still not sure of their choice, lending hope to third-placed candidate &lt;a href="w%3AFran%C3%A7ois%20Bayrou"&gt;François Bayrou&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUnion%20for%20French%20Democracy"&gt;UDF&lt;/a&gt;) and to &lt;a href="w%3AJean-Marie%20Le%20Pen"&gt;Jean-Marie Le Pen&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Front%20%28France%29"&gt;National Front&lt;/a&gt;), whom most polls had in fourth. 

One of the reasons for the high turnout seems to be that there are 3.3 million newly registered voters, many from lower-income immigrant neighborhoods, many of which saw &lt;a href="w%3A2005%20civil%20unrest%20in%20France"&gt;civil unrest in 2005&lt;/a&gt;. Nicolas Sarkozy was interior minister at the time and was criticized for his handling of the situation.

Local Socialist leader Ali Romdhane, who led a campaign drive in such a neighborhood, told the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20Times"&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, "In a way, Sarkozy helped us. Our slogan was, 'Vote instead of vandalize.' We told the young people that their strength rested in their voter identification card. And they are the ones who are going to make the difference."

If a candidate receives a majority of the vote in this round, the election is over. However, polls suggest that is an unlikely outcome. The second round will be between the two leading candidates from today's vote and will take place on Sunday, May 6, 2007. This is the ninth presidential election of the &lt;a href="w%3AFifth%20French%20Republic"&gt;French Fifth Republic&lt;/a&gt;.

<h3>Irregularities, violence mar Nigeria polls</h3>

Violence, ballot stuffing and a shortage of voting slips marred Saturday's presidential polls in &lt;a href="Nigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;. Sixteen people were reported killed and an attempt to blow up the election headquarters failed. 

The chief of the largest local monitoring group, Transition Monitoring Group, said that a winner could not be announced on the basis of the poll conducted. 

President &lt;a href="w%3AOlusegun%20Obasanjo"&gt;Olusegun Obasanjo&lt;/a&gt; said that despite flaws, the elections could achieve a peaceful and democratic transfer of power. Such a result would be the first time power changes from one civilian administration to another since Nigeria's independence in 1960. 

Opposition leader &lt;a href="w%3AMuhammadu%20Buhari"&gt;Muhammadu Buhari&lt;/a&gt; said he would call his supporters on to the streets if the ruling People's Democratic Party's candidate to succeed Obasanjo, &lt;a href="w%3AUmaru%20Yar%27Adua"&gt;Umaru Yar'Adua&lt;/a&gt;, is announced the winner. 

The Nigerian supreme court ordered that Vice-President &lt;a href="w%3AAtiku%20Abubakar"&gt;Atiku Abubakar&lt;/a&gt;'s name be included in the ballot five days before elections, contributing to logistical difficulties. 

Early results are showing a victory for Yar'Adua.

<h3>Twelve killed in attack on Iraqi police station</h3>

Two &lt;a href="w%3Asuicide%20attack"&gt;suicide car bombers&lt;/a&gt; attacked a &lt;a href="w%3APolice%20station"&gt;police station&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. The first sped through a &lt;a href="w%3ACivilian%20checkpoint"&gt;checkpoint&lt;/a&gt; and blew up in front of the station; the second was detonated at the checkpoint.

Sunday's bombings in the mostly &lt;a href="w%3AShia%20Islam"&gt;Shi'ite&lt;/a&gt; al-Bayaa neighborhood in the southwest of the city killed 12 and wounded 95, police said. Reversing an earlier statement, police said most of the dead were &lt;a href="w%3ACivilian"&gt;civilians&lt;/a&gt;.

Police said the explosions had destroyed several police vehicles and damaged the station. ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ published pictures showing the entire facade of the building collapsed and said that a garage next door was mostly destroyed.

<h3>Ex-PMs of Bangladesh: Hasina not returning, Zia going into exile</h3>

Former &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Bangladesh"&gt;Prime Minister of Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASheikh%20Hasina"&gt;Sheikh Hasina&lt;/a&gt; has been prevented from boarding a flight to her home country by &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Airways"&gt;British Airways&lt;/a&gt;. The airline received a letter from &lt;a href="Bangladesh"&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;i authorities warning it not to carry her or else the plane would not be allowed to land. Hasina faces charges of murder and extortion if she does manage to return.

Meanwhile, fellow former Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AKhaleda%20Zia"&gt;Khaleda Zia&lt;/a&gt;, who had been fighting to stay in the country to face any charges that might result from a recent crackdown on &lt;a href="w%3ACorruption"&gt;corruption&lt;/a&gt;, has now given in to pressure from the government to go into &lt;a href="w%3AExile"&gt;exile&lt;/a&gt;. She is said to be going to &lt;a href="Saudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt; as soon as &lt;a href="w%3AVisa%20%28document%29"&gt;visas&lt;/a&gt; have been issued.

Hasina and Zia are bitter rivals and had been considered the top candidates in January elections that were called off. International observers have blamed many of the problems facing Bangladesh on the two former prime ministers.

On Sunday evening at 9:15 p.m., the Interior Ministry of &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; announced official results with 98% of ballots counted in the first round of the &lt;a href="2007%20French%20presidential%20election"&gt;2007 French presidential election&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="Nicolas%20Sarkozy"&gt;Nicolas Sarkozy&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUnion%20for%20a%20Popular%20Movement"&gt;UMP&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href="S%C3%A9gol%C3%A8ne%20Royal"&gt;Ségolène Royal&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ASocialist%20Party%20%28France%29"&gt;Socialist Party&lt;/a&gt;) will be the two candidates to proceed to the second round, as their lead on the competition is insurmountable.

Sarkozy received the most votes, with 31.11% of the vote. Royal received 25.83% of the vote. The two other main candidates, &lt;a href="w%3AFran%C3%A7ois%20Bayrou"&gt;François Bayrou&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUnion%20for%20French%20Democracy"&gt;UDF&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href="w%3AJean-Marie%20Le%20Pen"&gt;Jean-Marie Le Pen&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Front%20%28France%29"&gt;National Front&lt;/a&gt;) got 18.55% and 10.51%, respectively. No other candidate received more than 5%.

The election registered a turnout of 84.5%, the highest in nearly 50 years. The second round will be held on Sunday, May 6, 2007.

The Barclays Premiership gala awards dinner took place Sunday, with &lt;a href="w%3AManchester%20United"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt; being the winningest of clubs in the awards. The &lt;a href="w%3AProfessional%20Footballers%27%20Association"&gt;Professional Footballers' Association&lt;/a&gt; (PFA) presents awards to players every year who have been voted on by their peers as the best player of the season.

The front runner for the senior PFA award has been United midfielder &lt;a href="w%3ACristiano%20Ronaldo"&gt;Cristiano Ronaldo&lt;/a&gt;, and players agreed as he was the top vote recipient. &lt;a href="w%3ADidier%20Drogba"&gt;Didier Drogba&lt;/a&gt; finished second following his 31 goals for &lt;a href="w%3AChelsea%20FC"&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt;. Third place fell to Ronaldo's fellow Red Devil &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Scholes"&gt;Paul Scholes&lt;/a&gt;, who has helped lead United only one year after a serious eye injury which could have ended his career. Others in the running for the award were &lt;a href="w%3ACesc%20Fabregas"&gt;Cesc Fabregas&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AArsenal%20FC"&gt;Arsenal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Giggs"&gt;Ryan Giggs&lt;/a&gt; of Manchester United, and &lt;a href="w%3ASteven%20Gerrard"&gt;Steven Gerrard&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ALiverpool%20FC"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt;, who won the award last season.

In the young player PFA award Ronaldo again prevailed, as the 22 year old became only the second player in history to earn both awards in one year, the first being &lt;a href="w%3AAndy%20Gray%20%28commentator%29"&gt;Andy Gray&lt;/a&gt; in 1977. Cesc Fabregas came second, while &lt;a href="w%3AAaron%20Lennon"&gt;Aaron Lennon&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ATottenham%20Hotspur"&gt;Tottenham&lt;/a&gt; finished in third. &lt;a href="w%3AWayne%20Rooney"&gt;Wayne Rooney&lt;/a&gt;, who won the award the previous two years, was nominated as well along with &lt;a href="w%3AMicah%20Richards"&gt;Micah Richards&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AManchester%20City%20FC"&gt;Manchester City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Doyle"&gt;Kevin Doyle&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AReading%20FC"&gt;Reading&lt;/a&gt;.

The Premiership team of the year was also announced, with eight Manchester United players being named. Keeper &lt;a href="w%3AEdwin%20Van%20Der%20Sar"&gt;Edwin Van Der Sar&lt;/a&gt; along with the entire back line all play for United. The back line is made up of &lt;a href="w%3AGary%20Neville"&gt;Gary Neville&lt;/a&gt; at right back, &lt;a href="w%3APatrice%20Evra"&gt;Patrice Evra&lt;/a&gt; on the left, with &lt;a href="w%3ARio%20Ferdinand"&gt;Rio Ferdinand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANemanja%20Vidic"&gt;Nemanja Vidic&lt;/a&gt; as central defenders. Ronaldo was also on the team at right wing, with fellow PFA candidate Ryan Giggs on the left. The central midfielders where named as Paul Scholes and Steven Gerrard. Didier Drogba was named in the team as striker, along with Tottenham's &lt;a href="w%3ADimitar%20Berbatov"&gt;Dimitar Berbatov&lt;/a&gt;, who has impressed greatly in his first year in the Premiership. 

The special merit award was also directed to Manchester United, as manager &lt;a href="w%3ASir%20Alex%20Ferguson"&gt;Sir Alex Ferguson&lt;/a&gt; picked up the award.

Upon winning the double, Ronaldo exclaimed that "It is a special night. It is amazing and a big honour for me to win trophies like this in the English Premier League. I am very proud." And continued "My colleagues have voted for me and that is fantastic because the players know the qualities of players."

Manager Sir Alex Ferguson also commented on Ronaldo, saying "At this moment in time, I think he is the best player in the world and his season has been incredible."

A 2-1 victory over Siena and a loss by &lt;a href="AS%20Roma"&gt;Roma&lt;/a&gt; allowed Internazionale to uncork the champagne as they clinched the &lt;a href="Serie%20A"&gt;Serie A&lt;/a&gt; title for the first time since 1988-89. Inter were awarded the Scudetto last year after Juventus was stripped of the award due to the match fixing scandal, though this year they have won it on the pitch. Inter could have secured the title last week when they took on Roma at the San Siro, but Roma killed their record dreams with a 3-1 win.

Inter scored first against Siena on Sunday through defender Marco Materazzi, but Siena levelled minutes later through Paolo Negro. A penalty in the 60th minute was then awarded to Inter, and Materazzi dispatched the ball home to earn them the three points.

Meanwhile at the Stadio Azzurri D`Italia, Atalanta hosted Roma, as the Nerazzurri attempted to prolong Inter's celebrations. Atalanta shook Roma with two first half goals by Cristiano Doni and Riccardo Zampagna. A goal midway through the second half by Simone Perrotta pulled Roma within one, but they could not produce a comeback as frustration boiled over for defender Matteo Ferrari, who was red carded for a cynical challenge.

After securing the title, Inter revealed a contract extension for manager Roberto Mancini. The deal is for four years with an option to extend for another 12 months. Speculation has arose as of late about a replacement, but Mancini's title wining season earned him the stay.

At least 3 people have been killed and 7 others are missing after a 6.2 &lt;a href="w%3ARichter%20magnitude%20scale"&gt;magnitude&lt;/a&gt; earthquake set off landslides in a &lt;a href="w%3Afjord"&gt;fjord&lt;/a&gt; in Southern &lt;a href="Chile"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt;, creating massive waves that swept people off the beach to sea. 
According to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Geological%20Survey"&gt;United States Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt; or USGS, the &lt;a href="w%3Aepicenter"&gt;epicenter&lt;/a&gt; was located 55 kilometers [35 miles] northwest of &lt;a href="w%3ACoihaique%2C%20Chile"&gt;Coihaique, Chile&lt;/a&gt; in the village of Aisen and had a depth of 27 kilometers [16.8 miles] and the quake occurred at 17:53 (UTC) on Saturday. 

Initial reports from Chile's government said that there were no signs of deaths, injuries or damage.

Later, it emerged that at least 10 people on a nearby beach were swept away by the 25-foot waves. The waves were not a tsunami wave, according to &lt;a href="w%3AVolcanology"&gt;volcanologist&lt;/a&gt; Juan Cayupi, but were created by the debris of the landslide falling into the waters in the narrow fjord.

Rescuers have recovered only three bodies. According to the Chilean Emergency Bureau, the bodies have been identified as; Ernesto Contreras, 65, Elsa Poblete, 54, his wife and Genaro Linay, 2, their grandson.

No tsunami warning was issued following the earthquake.

Several boats were damaged by the waves generated by the landslide, but there was no report of structural damage to any buildings.

&lt;a href="w%3AHojjatol-Islam"&gt;Hojjatol-Islam&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGholam%20Hossein%20Mohseni-Ejehei"&gt;Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Ejeie&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AMinistry%20of%20Intelligence%20%28Iran%29"&gt;intelligence minister&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;, stated in the report released today that Iran is investigating the disappearance of Robert Levinson, an ex-&lt;a href="FBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; agent from Florida since his trip to Iran's &lt;a href="w%3AKish%20Island"&gt;Kish Island&lt;/a&gt; who went missing while in Iran on private business, in March. He is believed to have gone missing several weeks ago on the island of Kish.

Iran has not confirmed the U.S. citizen entered its territory. Nonetheless, the State Department spokesman said, "To the best of our knowledge we have been able to determine that he went (to Iran) ... and we have not seen any evidence that he left." The State Department contacted Iranian authorities regarding the matter from the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; Embassy in the &lt;a href="United%20Arab%20Emirates"&gt;United Arab Emirates&lt;/a&gt; capital &lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Dhabi"&gt;Abu Dhabi&lt;/a&gt; earlier. Later, Iran relayed a reply to the U.S. via the &lt;a href="Switzerland"&gt;Swiss&lt;/a&gt; embassy in &lt;a href="w%3ATehran"&gt;Tehran&lt;/a&gt; which acts as a go-between since there are no diplomatic relations between the two countries.

On April 3, the FBI said that he has not worked for them in a decade nor is he a contractor for them. A U.S. State Department spokesperson declined to give name, age or occupation of the missing man at the time. The spokesperson also said that they have no indication that he is being held by any Iranian entity.

There were rumors that Iran wanted to swap the former FBI agent for &lt;a href="w%3AAli-Reza%20Askari"&gt;Ali-Reza Askari&lt;/a&gt;. Askari, who was a deputy defense minister of Iran, had defected. However, Hujjat al-Islam Mohseni-Ejei denied such stories.

&lt;a href="w%3AQantas"&gt;Qantas&lt;/a&gt;, Australia's primary airline, has begun checking the batteries of &lt;a href="w%3ADell"&gt;Dell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AApple"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; computers and in some cases removing them for the safety of the passengers. This relatively new safety precaution was sparked by a battery recall a few months ago. 4 million Dell laptops worldwide were recalled after some of the laptop batteries exploded, causing the laptop to erupt into a fireball.

Although Qantas has yet to release a statement, they are expected to within the next few days. The company said in an interview that the practice has been occurring for a number of months for the passengers' safety to mitigate the rare chance of fire.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Australians%20and%20News%20Zealanders%20increasingly%20support%20shared%20currency&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A recent survey has shown that the public support of a shared currency between &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; has risen.

The Australian survey, released at the Australia New Zealand Leadership Forum, has shown that the support for a shared currency in New Zealand is at 49%. The Australian support is slightly lower at 41%.

&lt;a href="w%3AHelen%20Clark"&gt;Helen Clark&lt;/a&gt;, Prime Minister of New Zealand, has said that New Zealand would not have a shared currency, but an Australian currency. She fears that the new dollar would be run by an Australian Reserve Bank, driving interest rates that are unrelated to the state of the New Zealand economy. Miss Clark told the New Zealand Press Association, "The convergence of trying to bring the two [economies] together could be quite rough on the smaller party [New Zealand]."

Opposition National party leader, &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Key"&gt;John Key&lt;/a&gt; is supporting an exploration of the idea of a shared currency.

Operations at &lt;a href="w%3ASnowy%20Mountains%20Scheme"&gt;Snowy Mountains Hydro&lt;/a&gt; may be suspended in weeks as water supplies fall due to the drought which has affected much of South-Eastern &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;. Water stores as part of the scheme are at their lowest levels since it was opened in 1973.

Mayor of the Snowy Mountains Shire Council, Richard Wallace warned that should water levels in dams continue to fall, many towns in the area may suffer from water shortages. He also warned that the Snowy Mountains Hydro electric scheme could be suspended.

Snowy Hydro Limited, the company which operates the scheme, has predicted that water levels in &lt;a href="w%3ALake%20Jindabyne"&gt;Lake Jindabyne&lt;/a&gt; will fall below the threshold needed to operate power turbines by mid to late May. &lt;a href="w%3ALake%20Eucumbene"&gt;Lake Eucumbene&lt;/a&gt;, the second water source for the scheme will fall below its threshold by late July or early August.

A statement by the company claims that over the last decade, water levels have continued to fall as the drought continues. The drought has lasted longer than the region's previous worst which lasted from 1936 to 1946.

According to the company, water flows are around 30 percent lower than average, with the last eleven months flows being lower than those recorded in 101 years.

It is also feared that low water stores may affect the supply of water for some towns in the region. The Snowy River Alliance, an organisation which promotes the conservation of the Snowy River predicts that water may have to be trucked into towns such as &lt;a href="w%3ADalgety%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Dalgety&lt;/a&gt; in the near future.

The &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Space%20Research%20Organisation"&gt;Indian Space Research Organisation&lt;/a&gt; (ISRO) announced &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;’s first commercial launch of the &lt;a href="w%3APolar%20Satellite%20Launch%20Vehicle"&gt;Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle&lt;/a&gt; (PSLV). It is carrying the &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; satellite &lt;a href="w%3AAGILE%20%28spacecraft%29"&gt;AGILE&lt;/a&gt; which will gather information about the origins of the universe through imaging of distant celestial objects in the X-ray and Gamma ray regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.

India joined the elite club of nations who have the capacity to deploy their space exploration resources for commercial use. Currently, only the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Ukraine"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Space%20Agency"&gt;European Space Agency&lt;/a&gt; have the capacity to deploy their space exploration resources for commercial use. These nations dominate the commercial satellite launch services segment which is estimated to be worth $2.5 billion a year.

The PSLV rocket only has the capability of carrying relatively lighter loads of under 1,000 kilograms, but ISRO hopes to increase payloads soon.

<h3>Bomb threat forces landing of Greek airliner</h3>

<h3>Russian radio journalists told to report 'positive news'</h3>

The new &lt;a href="w%3APresidential%20Administration%20of%20Russia"&gt;Kremlin&lt;/a&gt;-allied managers of the radio network Russian News Service have told journalists that half of their reporting must be 'positive stories', opposition leaders should not be talked about on air and the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; is to be represented as an enemy; the network's staff say. 

Russian News Service is the largest independent radio network with an estimated seven million listeners. The country's three television networks are all state-controlled, while radio stations and small newspapers tend to be independent.

Reports on deaths, violence and poverty are all to be considered as not positive, an editor at the network told the ♡❤New York Times♡❤. A former news editor, Mikhail G. Baklanov told the ♡❤NYT♡❤ that owners had previously not interfered in editorial matters. 

The press freedom watchdog group &lt;a href="w%3AReporters%20Without%20Borders"&gt;Reporters Without Borders&lt;/a&gt; ranks &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; 147th out of 168 countries listed in its annual press freedom index, citing the murders of prominent journalists, the control of media outlets by business groups close to the Kremlin and the passing of restrictive laws.

<h3>Denmark welcomes new princess</h3>

&lt;a href="Denmark"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt; welcomed a new princess, born Saturday to &lt;a href="w%3AMary%2C%20Crown%20Princess%20of%20Denmark"&gt;Crown Princess Mary&lt;/a&gt; and her husband &lt;a href="w%3AFrederik%2C%20Crown%20Prince%20of%20Denmark"&gt;Crown Prince Frederik&lt;/a&gt;. The couple left the &lt;a href="w%3ARigshospitalet"&gt;national hospital&lt;/a&gt; today. Mary addressed the throngs of press: "She slept well... She has been very good and kind to her mother... We have not decided on a name yet but we are considering a few."
The &lt;a href="w%3APrincess%20NN%20of%20Denmark"&gt;yet-to-be named princess&lt;/a&gt; is third in line to the Danish throne behind her father, Frederik, and her brother, &lt;a href="w%3APrince%20Christian%20of%20Denmark"&gt;Prince Christian&lt;/a&gt;. She is the fourth grandchild of &lt;a href="w%3AMargrethe%20II%20of%20Denmark"&gt;Queen Margrethe II&lt;/a&gt;, the reigning &lt;a href="w%3Amonarch"&gt;monarch&lt;/a&gt;.

The mother was born Mary Donaldson in &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; and married Frederik in May of 2004.

Former &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20Russia"&gt;President of Russia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Boris%20Yeltsin"&gt;Boris Yeltsin&lt;/a&gt; has died at age 76, according to a &lt;a href="w%3AMoscow%20Kremlin"&gt;Kremlin&lt;/a&gt; spokesperson.

"Today, at 15:45 (11:45 GMT) Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin died in the Central Clinical Hospital as a result of a deteriorating cardio-vascular problem," said the spokesperson. Yeltsin had a history of heart problems.

Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin (Russian: Бори́с Никола́евич Е́льцин) was the first President of the &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russian Federation&lt;/a&gt; from 1991 to 1999. The Yeltsin era was a traumatic period in Russian history— marked by widespread corruption, economic collapse, and enormous political and social problems.

Yeltsin maintained a low profile since his resignation, making almost no public statements or appearances. However, on February 1, 2006, Yeltsin celebrated his 75th birthday. He used this occasion as an opportunity to criticize a "monopolistic" &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; foreign policy, and to state that &lt;a href="Vladimir%20Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; was the right choice for Russia.

A &lt;a href="Vatican%20City"&gt;Vatican City&lt;/a&gt; official has referred to &lt;a href="abortion"&gt;abortion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="euthanasia"&gt;euthanasia&lt;/a&gt; as "terrorism with a human face."

Archbishop Angelo Amato is the acting Secretary of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACongregation%20for%20the%20Doctrine%20of%20the%20Faith"&gt;Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; which is led by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWilliam%20Levada"&gt;William Cardinal Levada&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . He was addressing Vatican chaplains, when he made the remarks on Monday in a keynote address that opened an April 23 to 27 seminar in Rome with Catholic airport chaplains. The seminar's main focus is security and preparedness against acts of terrorism. 

"[Abortion clinics are] slaughterhouses of human beings" and abortion is "abominable terrorism. [There are other] parliaments of so-called civilized nations where laws contrary to the nature of the human being are being promulgated, such as the approval of marriage between people of the same sex," said Amato, who has been a bishop for four years.

"For example, abortion is called ♡❤voluntary interruption of pregnancy♡❤ and not the killing of a defenceless human being, an abortion clinic is given a harmless, even attractive, name: ♡❤centre for reproductive health♡❤ and euthanasia is blandly called ♡❤death with dignity♡❤," added Amato.

Amato called the press "a perverse film about evil. Evils that remain almost invisible" and also accused the press of "manipulating" their news content "to hide the tragic reality of the facts."

A new drink called ♡❤Robby Bubble♡❤ has sparkled up some sparkled debate with distributors and &lt;a href="w%3AMothers%20Against%20Drunk%20Driving"&gt;Mothers Against Drunk Driving&lt;/a&gt; (MADD) in &lt;a href="w%3ACalgary"&gt;Calgary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAlberta"&gt;Alberta&lt;/a&gt;.

The drink, similar to &lt;a href="w%3ASparkling%20wine"&gt;sparkling wine&lt;/a&gt;, is a non-alcoholic sparkling drink which is currently for sale in Alberta liquor stores. The bottle has the words "Party, Party!" with cartoon characters. Their slogan is "Celebrate like the grown-ups" and is shaped as a champagne bottle. It is under the approval of the &lt;a href="w%3AAlberta%20Gaming%20and%20Liquor%20Commission"&gt;Alberta Gaming and Liquor Commission&lt;/a&gt;.

Tracy Franklin, president of MADD in Calgary, said: "It's calling out to kids, but the whole thing is geared as a champagne bottle, as an alcohol product ... Do we want to give them something, although it's non-alcoholic, and have them partying like an adult?"

Other "adult products" marketed to children, such as &lt;a href="w%3Acandy%20cigarette"&gt;candy cigarettes&lt;/a&gt;, have been banned in Canada. Studies have shown a link between the marketing of candy cigarettes to children and the promotion of smoking in later life. It had been shown that tobacco companies cooperated with candy manufacturers in the design of candy cigarettes.

The Tobacco Act legislation in Canada has eliminated the ability of companies to market tobacco-looking products to children. In Section 27, the Act states, "No person shall furnish or promote a tobacco product if any of its brand elements is displayed on a non-tobacco product, other than an accessory, or is used with a service, if the non-tobacco product or service is associated with young persons or could be construed on reasonable grounds to be appealing to young persons."

President of the German company responsible for the distribution of ♡❤Robby Bubble♡❤, Darryl Weinbren, defended his product saying it is non-alcoholic and parents are responsible for serving their children the drink.

"I can understand Mothers Against Drunk Driving, and certainly I respect their objectives and what they are after. There wasn't any intention from our point of view to encourage kids to drink alcohol. It was just a matter of trying to find something that would meet a family celebration with something for their kids."

A spokeswomen for the Alberta Gaming and Liquor Commission, Marilyn Carlyle-Helms, said liquor stores can distribute non-alcoholic drinks and if there were a health concern they would have disapproved them.

A stoppage time goal by &lt;a href="Wayne%20Rooney"&gt;Wayne Rooney&lt;/a&gt; lifted &lt;a href="Manchester%20United"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt; to a 3-2 win over &lt;a href="AC%20Milan"&gt;AC Milan&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOld%20Trafford"&gt;Old Trafford&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AManchester"&gt;Manchester&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . United have never defeated Milan over two legs, having lost twice to them in semi-finals, and once in the round of sixteen previously. With injuries mounting for United, they were forced to play an extremely altered back line, with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20O%27Shea"&gt;John O'Shea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGabriel%20Heinze"&gt;Gabriel Heinze&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the centre of defense. Milan had a boost before the match as keeper &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANelson%20Dida"&gt;Nelson Dida&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; proved fit enough to play. United opted for only one striker in Wayne Rooney, while Milan did the same fielding &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAlberto%20Gilardino"&gt;Alberto Gilardino&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The game also featured two of the best young midfielders in the world currently, with &lt;a href="Cristiano%20Ronaldo"&gt;Cristiano Ronaldo&lt;/a&gt; for United and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARicardo%20Kaka"&gt;Kaka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for AC Milan.

Manchester had a dream start to the match when Ronaldo opened the scoring after only five minutes. Dida was caught out of net as Ronaldo headed towards goal, and after slapping twice at the ball, it eventually found its way into the net. United, and Ronaldo in particular, continued to threaten the Milan goal, but the next chance fell to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Carrick"&gt;Michael Carrick&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; whos stinging shot was saved well by Dida. Milan then equalized through a high qualty goal from Kaka. Kaka as he received a through ball from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AClarence%20Seedorf"&gt;Seedorf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and the Brazilian sprinted past the defense and slid the ball past &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEdwin%20van%20der%20Sar"&gt;Van Der Sar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . United continued to threaten, but nothing came of chances for both &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Giggs"&gt;Giggs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and Rooney. A curling shot by Ronaldo almost fooled Dida, but he managed to palm it away. Kaka then had a solo effort to lift Milan into the lead, as he managed to beat out three defenders, two of which collided with each other, and curl the ball past Van Der Sar. Milan continued to pressure and Kaka nearly had a hat-trick off a 30-yard drive, but Van Der Sar saved well. 

United started brightly in the second half, clearly not wanting a home loss in the Champions League, and Carrick should have done better as he volleyed wide off a corner from Giggs. Kaka continued to threaten for Milan, but could not get his attempts on target. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Scholes"&gt;Paul Scholes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; then played a cheeky scooped ball into Rooney within the box, and after controlling it on his chest, the Englishman slid the ball under Dida to tie the match. United pushed for the winning goal, and they eventually earned it in stoppage time as a through ball by Giggs found Rooney, and his first time strike flew past an out of position Dida to earn Rooney the brace, and give United the advantage for the second leg.

Milans next match comes this Saturday against &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATorino%20F.C."&gt;Torino&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASerie%20A"&gt;Seria A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as they try to clinch a Champions League berth for next season, while United take on &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEverton%20F.C."&gt;Everton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGoodison%20Park"&gt;Goodison Park&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , as they are in a tight race with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChelsea%20F.C."&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for the Premier League title. The second leg between the two will take place on May 2 at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStadio%20Giuseppe%20Meazza"&gt;Stadio Giuseppe Meazza&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in Milan.

&lt;a href="Thailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;'s anti-corruption body, the Assets Examination Committee (AEC) has instructed the country's tax authorities to issue a tax bill to the company set up by ousted Prime Minister &lt;a href="Thaksin%20Shinawatra"&gt;Thaksin Shinawatra&lt;/a&gt;. The amount is US$616 million, or 20.89 billion &lt;a href="w%3Abaht"&gt;baht&lt;/a&gt;.

The company Ample Rich is registered in the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Virgin%20Islands"&gt;British Virgin Islands&lt;/a&gt;, however the AEC stated the company could not evade corporate tax due to their operations taking place within the Kingdom of Thailand.

With two of Thaksin's children on the board of directors of the company, and earlier rulings on tax liability, the &lt;a href="w%3ABangkok%20Post"&gt;Bangkok Post&lt;/a&gt; reports that the total tax liability for the Shinawatra family has now risen to 27.44 billion baht.

The main reason given by the AEC for the tax bill is the underpriced selling of Shin corporation shares to the Thaksin children at 1 baht per share only days prior to the sale of the company to Temasek holdings. The actual sale of Shin Corp. sparked street protests in Bangkok as the then-Prime Minister was accused of profiting from selling a national asset after changing the law to allow the sale to be tax-free.

"The forest is composed of a bizarre mixture of extinct plants: abundant club mosses, more than 40 metres high, towering over a sub-canopy of tree ferns, intermixed with shrubs and tree-sized horsetails. Nowhere elsewhere on the planet is it possible to (literally) walk through such an extensive swathe of Carboniferous rainforest," said a press release by the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Bristol"&gt;University of Bristol&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;.

In forests, over time, the leaves, branches and other material will build up, layer after layer with the oldest layer on the bottom, and the youngest layer at the top. The scientists observed the layers on the top of the mine shaft.

"It was an amazing experience. We drove down the mine in an armored vehicle, until we were a hundred meters below the surface. The fossil forest was rooted on top of the coal seam, so where the coal had been mined away the fossilized forest was visible in the ceiling of the mine. The fossilized forest was preserved following a major earthquake 300 million years ago," said Howard Falcon-Lang, &lt;a href="w%3APaleobotany"&gt;paleobotanist&lt;/a&gt; with the University of Bristol, who observed the fossil.

The forest was estimated to contain trees that were more than 130 feet high. It also contained a variety of smaller trees, shrubs and ferns. One fossil was shaped like an asparagus stalk, but was the size of a small tree.

It is believed that the forest was buried in nearly a flash after the land was pushed downward, below sea level, after a massive earthquake burying the forest "forever."

"The fossilized forest was preserved following a major earthquake 300 million years ago. The quake caused the whole region to drop below sea level whereupon the forest became buried in mud, preserving it forever," added the press release.

The forest is dated to have been alive in the &lt;a href="w%3ACarboniferous"&gt;Carboniferous period&lt;/a&gt;.

"We have seen a lot of recent attacks up in Diyala... that have been part of the fight for the province," said Lieutenant-Colonel Christopher Garver, a spokesman for the U.S. military in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;.

A militant group calling itself the &lt;a href="w%3AIslamic%20State%20of%20Iraq"&gt;Islamic State in Iraq&lt;/a&gt; claimed in a statement they posted on a website: "Two knights from the Islamic State in Iraq ... [in] two booby-trapped trucks hit the heart of the Crusader American headquarters in the region of Diyala."

At least 3,333 American troops have been killed since 2003 when the U.S. invaded Iraq.

&lt;a href="w%3AAbdullah%20G%C3%BCl"&gt;Abdullah Gül&lt;/a&gt;, current deputy prime minister and foreign minister of &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;, has been named as the new presidential candidate by his party, the &lt;a href="w%3AJustice%20and%20Development%20Party%20%28Turkey%29"&gt;Justice and Development Party&lt;/a&gt; (AKP).

In Turkey, the parliament votes to elect the new &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20Turkey"&gt;President of Turkey&lt;/a&gt;. The AKP has 353 of the 550 seats in &lt;a href="w%3AGrand%20National%20Assembly%20of%20Turkey"&gt;Grand National Assembly of Turkey&lt;/a&gt;. While Gül may not get elected in the first or second round, when a two-thirds majority is needed, their votes are enough to elect the new president at the third or fourth rounds of the election process, when a simple majority is needed. The first round will take place on Friday.

&lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Turkey"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Recep%20Tayyip%20Erdo%C4%9Fan"&gt;Recep Tayyip Erdoğan&lt;/a&gt; announced Gül's selection on Tuesday. The decision comes in the wake of a very large demonstration aimed at dissuading Erdoğan from running himself. Erdoğan said that Gül was "the person who emerged at the end of our evaluations as the candidate to become Turkey's 11th president."

Both the current president, &lt;a href="w%3AAhmet%20Necdet%20Sezer"&gt;Ahmet Necdet Sezer&lt;/a&gt;, and the influential head of the &lt;a href="w%3ATurkish%20Armed%20Forces"&gt;Turkish Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AYa%C5%9Far%20B%C3%BCy%C3%BCkan%C4%B1t"&gt;General Yaşar Büyükanıt&lt;/a&gt; have stressed that the new president must defend Turkey's secular values. To that end Gül said: "the president must be loyal to secular principles... The president must be bound by the basic principles of the constitution... If I am elected I will act accordingly."

The main opposition party, the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20People%27s%20Party%20%28Turkey%29"&gt;Republican People's Party&lt;/a&gt; (CHP), hinted that it may nominate its own candidate to challenge Gül.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Coast%20Guard"&gt;United States Coast Guard&lt;/a&gt; (USCG) has seized 20 tons or nearly 40,000 pounds of &lt;a href="w%3Acocaine"&gt;cocaine&lt;/a&gt; with a street value of over US$500 million in what authorities call one of the largest cocaine busts in history.

Three busts in total were made in a period of nearly one month. The first on February 19, off the coast of &lt;a href="w%3AMexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, March 18 off the coast of &lt;a href="w%3APanama"&gt;Panama&lt;/a&gt; and on March 25, also off the coast of Panama.

In the first bust on February 19, "the Ecuadorian-flagged fishing vessel Don Juan K was approached in the &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Ocean"&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt; February 19 off the coast of &lt;a href="w%3AMexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; while allegedly offloading cocaine into "go-fast" (cigarette-style boat) boats. The fishing vessel's crew apparently set fire to Don Juan K in an attempt to destroy the evidence and flee in the go-fasts. The &lt;a href="w%3AUSCGC%20Sherman%20%28WHEC-720%29"&gt;USCGC Sherman&lt;/a&gt; stopped the go-fasts and recovered about 900 pounds of cocaine as Don Juan K sank. The 14 crew members are being processed for further legal action," said a statement on the USCG's website.

The second bust on March 18 yielded nearly 40,000 pounds of cocaine.

"The 330-foot Panamanian-flagged motor vessel Gatun was interdicted in the Pacific Ocean Mar. 18 off the coast of Panama while heading north toward the United States. Sherman's crew stopped and boarded the vessel and found 765 bales of cocaine weighing approximately 38,000 pounds in two shipping containers. Gatun was escorted back to Panama and its 14 crew members processed for further legal action," added the statement.

In the third bust on March 25, at least 2,000 pounds of cocaine was seized, also from a ship off Panama's coast.

"[The] Sherman's crew stopped and boarded a small stateless go-fast in the Pacific Ocean Mar. 25 off the coast of Panama following a short chase, in which, the go-fast attempted to flee at a high rate of speed. Approximately 2,000 pounds of cocaine was found aboard the go-fast and its four crew members were processed for further legal action," said the statement.

Several agencies both in the U.S. and in other countries in Central and South America and will continue to investigate the extent of the drug ring.

"The Coast Guard works in close coordination with Joint Interagency Task Force South, U.S. Attorney's office, Panama Express South, DEA, FBI, Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and Customs and Border Protection, as well as the Departments of Justice, State and Homeland Security on counter drug operations in the Pacific Ocean near Central and South America. These drug smuggling routes are some of the most active, yielding roughly 70 percent of the cocaine seized annually by the Coast Guard," added the statement.

&lt;a href="w%3ASri%20Lanka%20national%20cricket%20team"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt; have progressed to the final of the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Cricket%20World%20Cup"&gt;2007 Cricket World Cup&lt;/a&gt;. They posted 289-5 in their 50 overs against &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20cricket%20team"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; in the first semi-final at &lt;a href="w%3ASabina%20Park"&gt;Sabina Park&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AKingston%2C%20Jamaica"&gt;Kingston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJamaica"&gt;Jamaica&lt;/a&gt;. Captain &lt;a href="w%3AMahela%20Jayawardene"&gt;Mahela Jayawardene&lt;/a&gt; made his maiden century of the World Cup, making 115*, whilst &lt;a href="w%3AUpul%20Tharanga"&gt;Upul Tharanga&lt;/a&gt; reached 73 before being bowled by Vettori.

In response, New Zealand struggled to 32/2, losing captain &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Fleming"&gt;Stephen Fleming&lt;/a&gt; for just 1 and &lt;a href="w%3ARoss%20Taylor"&gt;Ross Taylor&lt;/a&gt; soon after for 9. &lt;a href="w%3AScott%20Styris"&gt;Scott Styris&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Fulton"&gt;Peter Fulton&lt;/a&gt; began rebuilding - their 50 partnership coming up in just 52 balls - including one over where they hit 20 off of some wayward bowling by &lt;a href="w%3ADilhara%20Fernando"&gt;Dilhara Fernando&lt;/a&gt;. But Styris fell 2 overs later to &lt;a href="w%3ATillakaratne%20Dilshan"&gt;Tillakaratne Dilshan&lt;/a&gt;, followed by a New Zealand middle order collapse: going from 105/3 from 22 overs to 116/7 from 26. &lt;a href="w%3ACraig%20McMillan"&gt;Craig McMillan&lt;/a&gt; hit a quick-fire 25, but just one ball after hitting a huge maximum he missed the ball, resulting in him being bowled out by &lt;a href="w%3ASanath%20Jayasuriya"&gt;Sanath Jayasuriya&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AShane%20Bond"&gt;Bond&lt;/a&gt; fell soon after for &lt;a href="w%3AMuttiah%20Muralitharan"&gt;Muralitharan&lt;/a&gt;'s 4th wicket, leaving New Zealand on the brink of being eliminated from the competition. &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Franklin"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJeetan%20Patel"&gt;Patel&lt;/a&gt; rebuilt and reached their 50 partnership in just 55 balls - which is a new record for a 10th wicket partnership for this World Cup - but Patel succumbed to trying to slog Dilshan over midwicket, but falling short and being caught by &lt;a href="w%3ADilhara%20Fernando"&gt;Fernando&lt;/a&gt; to finish New Zealand's resistance. Sri Lanka won in comfortable fashion by a margin of 81 runs.

A prison riot occurred at the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Castle%20Correctional%20Facility"&gt;New Castle Correctional Facility&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href="w%3AIndianapolis%2C%20Indiana"&gt;Indianapolis, Indiana&lt;/a&gt;. The incident began at about 2:00 pm and order has since been restored. Two prison employees have sustained injuries.

Local newspaper reports also say for a short time inmates took over the prison. Inmates also set fires and the fire department was called. Police have been trying to get all inmates back into their housing rooms. They used &lt;a href="w%3ARiot%20control%20agent"&gt;tear gas&lt;/a&gt; to disperse the prisoners and no shots were fired. Tear gas is used to loosen crowds, especially during large protests. It can cause irritation or disabling physical effects.
The &lt;a href="w%3AMayor"&gt;Mayor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Castle%2C%20Indiana"&gt;New Castle, Indiana&lt;/a&gt;, Tom Nipp, dispatched all of the city police officers to the prison to protect the safety of the residents. State Police were also called in by prison officials to assist in putting down the riot.

"We are quickly collaborating with local law enforcement to properly handle the New Castle Correctional Facility situation," said Commissioner J. David Donahue. "We will keep the public updated as more details unfold."

Nipp called the disturbance, "A full scale riot."

Within the last 24 hours prior to the uprising, new inmates from &lt;a href="w%3AArizona"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt; had been transferred into the facility. Recently, the states of Indiana and Arizona reached an agreement in which Indiana would house prisoners from Arizona in its prison system to decrease overcrowding in Arizona prisons. The prison was built in 2002 and can house about 2,200 inmates. It currently has about 1,000 from Indiana and 600 from Arizona.

A planet 50% greater in radius and with about 5 times earth mass orbiting the &lt;a href="w%3ARed%20dwarf"&gt;red dwarf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGliese%20581"&gt;Gliese 581&lt;/a&gt; has been discovered inside the constellation of &lt;a href="w%3ALibra%20%28constellation%29"&gt;Libra&lt;/a&gt;. 

A 2005 search revealed that the star Gliese 581 possessed a &lt;a href="w%3ANeptune"&gt;Neptune&lt;/a&gt; sized planet, prompting astronomers to take a closer look.

&lt;a href="w%3AGliese%20581%20c"&gt;Gliese 581 c&lt;/a&gt;, as the planet is aptly named, has an estimated surface temperature between 0 and 40°C (32 and 104°F). Scientists claim the planet is likely to have an atmosphere and liquid water.
A second planet, about 8 times the mass of earth, was also discovered not too far from Gliese 581 c.

A team of scientists from &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Switzerland"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Portugal"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt; discovered the planets using the ESO 3.6-m telescope from the &lt;a href="w%3AHigh%20Accuracy%20Radial%20Velocity%20Planet%20Searcher"&gt;High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher&lt;/a&gt; or HARPS, located at the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Southern%20Observatory"&gt;European Southern Observatory&lt;/a&gt; (ESO) in &lt;a href="w%3ALa%20Silla%2C%20Chile"&gt;La Silla&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Chile"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt;.

"The separation between the planet and its star is just right for having liquid water at its surface," said team spokesperson Stephane Udry of the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Geneva"&gt;Observatory of Geneva&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AVersoix"&gt;Versoix&lt;/a&gt;, Switzerland. "That's why we are a bit excited."

"Liquid water is critical to life as we know it and because of its temperature and relative proximity, this planet will most probably be a very important [focus] of future space missions dedicated to the search for extra-terrestrial life. On the treasure map of the Universe, one would be tempted to mark this planet with an X," added Xavier Delfosse, from &lt;a href="w%3AGrenoble%20University"&gt;Grenoble University&lt;/a&gt; in France.

The newly discovered planet is 20.5 light-years away from the &lt;a href="World"&gt;Earth&lt;/a&gt;.

<h3>74 killed in raid on oil field in Ethiopia</h3>

65 &lt;a href="Ethiopia"&gt;Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt;ns and 9 &lt;a href="China"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; were killed in their sleep Tuesday in a predawn raid on an oil field in Abole, a small town in southeast Ethiopia's Somali state. Seven Chinese were kidnapped.

The &lt;a href="w%3AOgaden%20National%20Liberation%20Front"&gt;Ogaden National Liberation Front&lt;/a&gt; (ONLF), a separatist group, claimed responsibility for the attack on the field which is run by a Chinese firm.

At a news conference, &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Ethiopia"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMeles%20Zenawi"&gt;Meles Zenawi&lt;/a&gt; said: "Such an outrage, the cold-blooded murder of people who were building roads and engaged in other development activities, is a measure of the level of barbarity involved."

Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Liu Jianchao, condemned the attack, which he said involved more than 200 gunmen.

<h3>Armed wing of Hamas declares end of truce</h3>

In response to weekend raids by &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;, the armed wing of &lt;a href="w%3AHamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIzz%20ad-Din%20al-Qassam%20Brigades"&gt;Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades&lt;/a&gt;, declared and end to a 5-month old truce and fired rockets into Israel. The rockets caused some damage, but no injuries were reported.

The Hamas-led &lt;a href="w%3APalestinian%20National%20Authority"&gt;Palestinian Authority&lt;/a&gt; (PA) urged calm. "The government is interested to keep the ceasefire and the calm and we are trying, through consultation and discussion with the Palestinian factions, to take a position in order to protect our people," PA spokesperson Ghazi Hamad said.

<h3>Mexico City legalizes abortion</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3AMexico%20City"&gt;México City&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of the world's second-largest &lt;a href="w%3ARoman%20Catholic%20church"&gt;Catholic&lt;/a&gt; country, &lt;a href="Mexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, voted today to legalize &lt;a href="w%3AAbortion"&gt;abortion&lt;/a&gt;.

City lawmakers passed legislation that legalizes abortion during the first three months of &lt;a href="w%3APregnancy"&gt;pregnancy&lt;/a&gt;. Hitherto, abortions were only legal in cases of &lt;a href="w%3ARape"&gt;rape&lt;/a&gt;, if the woman's life is in danger, or if there are signs of severe &lt;a href="w%3ACongenital%20disorder"&gt;defects&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AFetus"&gt;fetus&lt;/a&gt;.

The legislation passed in the face of pressure from Mexican &lt;a href="w%3ABishop"&gt;bishops&lt;/a&gt; who spoke out against the law. Opinion polls indicated that Mexico City residents were fairly evenly split on the issue.

Sponsors of the bill argued that the deaths of some 1,500 women during illegal abortions over the last ten years showed the need to legalize it.

The &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Liberal Party of Canada&lt;/a&gt; have put forward a motion to re-ensure Canadian soldiers will be pulled out of &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; two years from now in February.

Liberal defence critic &lt;a href="w%3ADenis%20Coderre"&gt;Denis Coderre&lt;/a&gt; says the Liberals "just don't believe them [the Conservatives] when they say the deadline is February 2009" and if Canadian soldiers were to be pulled out they "will still be there for development and diplomacy."

The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Democrats"&gt;NDP&lt;/a&gt;, who support an immediate withdrawal, say they will not support the motion. The &lt;a href="w%3ABloc%20Qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois"&gt;Bloc Québécois&lt;/a&gt; are expected to support the motion. 

In May of 2006, the Conservative government received approval by parliament to extend the mission in Afghanistan until February 2009, by a slim margin of four votes. Thirty Liberals supported the extension but the majority of them opposed. The NDP and Bloc Québécois ordered their members to vote against the extension. 

The Conservatives argue that the length of the Afghanistan mission is not within the purview of Parliament in any case.

Coderre also states the government have been buying military equipment and that could mean extending the mission. The Conservative government have recently said they want to stay in the country until the job is done and that could mean a longer extension.

The Liberal motion was defeated in parliament, Tuesday afternoon, by a vote of 150 to 134, with both the Conservatives and NDP voting against.

The man accused of killing a &lt;a href="w%3ALaval%2C%20Quebec"&gt;Laval, Quebec&lt;/a&gt; police officer on March 2, 2007 was released Tuesday on a CA$200,000 bail.

Basil Parasiris has been charged with several offences stemming from a drug raid carried out by police in the early morning hours of March 2. Among the alleged offences are a first-degree murder charge in the shooting death of Constable Daniel Tessier, attempted murder in the wounding of Tessier's partner, Stephane Forbes, and several weapons offences. Parasiris will remain free on bail pending a preliminary hearing to be held in August of this year.

For his part, Parasiris has not denied that the shooting took place, and has apologized to Tessier's family. He claims that he was acting in self defence, as he didn't know that it was police entering his house in a planned raid, and instead believed intruders had broken in. "I'm really, really sorry (about) what happened. My condolences to the Tessier family," Parasiris told &lt;a href="w%3ACTV%20National%20News"&gt;CTV News&lt;/a&gt;. "I honestly thought there was a home invasion or something."

The judge overseeing the bail proceedings, ruled that Parasiris would not pose an immediate threat to society, but did place strict conditions on his release. While awaiting trial, Parasiris, 41, will have to live with his father, obey a curfew, and not travel outside Canada.

In what is believed to be the first ruling of its kind in Canada, releasing on bail a defendant charged with killing a policeman, the judge criticized some of the police tactics used during the raid. Justice Jean-Guy Boilard of the &lt;a href="w%3AQuebec%20Superior%20Court"&gt;Quebec Superior Court&lt;/a&gt; noted that the police didn't use a "knock notice" before entering Parasiris' house, but rather used a battering ram to break down the door. When serving a warrant under normal conditions, police are to knock at the door and identify themselves. Jacques Larochelle, Parasiris' lawyer, indicated that he will contest the warrant's legality.

The prosecution argued that, even if it was not clear to Parasiris that police were entering his home, he should not have been so reckless with a gun.

During the fatal raid on the Parasiris home in March, police collected four loaded handguns, as well as a small amount of drugs and cash. According to reports, the 357-magnum handgun allegedly used by Parasiris to shoot the officers was legally registered.

&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;ns and &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealanders&lt;/a&gt; throughout the world turned out in huge numbers for their national war memorial day in remembrance of the failed &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20and%20New%20Zealand%20Army%20Corps"&gt;Australian and New Zealand Army Corps&lt;/a&gt; (ANZAC) &lt;a href="w%3ABattle%20of%20Gallipoli"&gt;attack on Gallipoli&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt; that began on 25 April 1915.

The fateful attack was designed to end the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20War%20I"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt; quicker by creating a supply line to &lt;a href="w%3AImperial%20Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;. A hundred thousand died in the battle, remembered every year as &lt;a href="w%3AANZAC%20Day"&gt;ANZAC Day&lt;/a&gt; by both nations. The &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt;-directed battle of Gallipoli is often seen as a defining moment in the 'birth' of Australia and New Zealand.

This is the 92nd anniversary of the attack.

Around 5,000 people turned out at the dawn service at Gallipoli, and around 7,000 attended the 11.00 a.m. service.

Meanwhile dawn services have been held throughout New Zealand. The numbers of veterans may be dwindling, but the numbers of those who come to pay their respects is not.

In Auckland a record number of people, thought to be over 5,000, attended the dawn service at the &lt;a href="w%3AAuckland%20War%20Memorial%20Museum"&gt;Auckland War Memorial Museum&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href="w%3AWellington"&gt;Wellington&lt;/a&gt;, over 1,000 people gathered at the &lt;a href="w%3ACenotaph"&gt;Cenotaph&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Parliament%20Buildings"&gt;Parliament buildings&lt;/a&gt;.

New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters called for greater effort towards the peaceful resolution of conflict.

"In remembering the suffering and loss on both sides, let us commit ourselves to working for a world where differences between nations can be resolved without resorting to war," Mr Peters said.

"That is the way that we can best honour the men who fought and died here."

In Australia there were record numbers at every state war memorial with around 20,000 people attending the service in Sydney. 200 people marched a different route though in recognition of the Aboriginal soldiers. In Perth, there were over 30,000 attendees at the dawn service war memorial in Kings Park.

In other countries around the world many visited the Australian and New Zealand war memorials. In London, as many as 2,500 Australian and New Zealanders turned up to the dawn services at the Hyde Park war memorials.

Australia and New Zealand commemorate the ANZAC Day public holiday on the 25th of April every year to honour the bravery and sacrifice of the members of the ANZAC's and of all those who served their country.

The carillion war memorial in &lt;a href="w%3ABathurst%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Bathurst&lt;/a&gt; in Central Western NSW was vandalised just hours before a dawn &lt;a href="w%3AANZAC%20day"&gt;ANZAC day&lt;/a&gt; service. Police allege that five teenage girls aged 15 and 16 were involved.

'&lt;a href="w%3ADigger%20%28soldier%29"&gt;Diggers&lt;/a&gt;' who had been looking forward to the dawn service said they were bought to tears after they learned that statements saying "ANZAC murderers" and "Aussies don't fight" were painted on the war memorial.

Police say they were called to the memorial after reports that a group of vandals had covered the shrine with offensive graffiti. Sergent Andrew Holand from Bathurst police said "Police arrived a short time later and observed that they had painted approximately one metre high, [beige coloured] slogans all the way around the exteriors of the war memorial using words such as "ANZAC murderers" and "Aussies don't fight" along with peace symbols".

"They've then taken the remnants of the four-litre paint cans and splashed these on the doors and external steps of the war memorial," he said.

When police located the group of five teenagers some were still covered in paint. All were taken to Bathurst Police Station where the 16 year-old girl was charged with maliciously damaging a shrine or war memorial and malicious damage to police property. It is alleged after she was arrested she damaged a police cell.

The four other girls involved, all aged 15 will be cautioned under the state's Youth Offenders Act.

Jim McFerran from the Bathurst &lt;a href="w%3AReturned%20and%20Services%20League%20of%20Australia"&gt;Returned and Services League of Australia&lt;/a&gt; (RSL) said he was humbled by efforts to clean up the graffiti. He said an effort involving RSL members, local army personnel, council workers, volunteer firefighters and a group of young men on their way home after a night out.

"We had about a dozen young fellas that were going home from the pub, they sort of stopped and said: 'What's going on here?'," said Mr McFerran.

"When they got told, they sort of walked over, bloody downed their things, grabbed ... pads and rags and starting getting in there with the rest of us."

NSW Premier &lt;a href="w%3AMorris%20Iemma"&gt;Morris Iemma&lt;/a&gt; condemned the vandalism, saying "They need a history lesson and a good kick up the backside as well."

An unnamed &lt;a href="Poland"&gt;Polish&lt;/a&gt; man, 35, is being treated at a hospital in &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; after he cut off his &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Apenis"&gt;penis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with a knife at Zizzi's pizza restaurant on &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStrand%2C%20London"&gt;Strand Street&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the city of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACity%20of%20Westminster"&gt;Westminster&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

"We were called at 9.00 p.m. on Sunday to a restaurant on the Strand to reports of a man in possession of a knife. Officers attended to discover a man believed to be 30-40 years old suffering from an injury. He was taken to a south London hospital in a stable condition. No one else was injured and his injuries are believed to be self inflicted," said a &lt;a href="Scotland%20Yard"&gt;Scotland Yard&lt;/a&gt; spokesperson.

Police had to use &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACS%20gas"&gt;CS tear gas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on the victim in order to subdue him to get him to the hospital to receive medical attention.

Witnesses say that the man came into the restaurant, picked a knife up off the floor of the kitchen and then got onto a table and cut off his penis.

"At around 9 p.m. on Sunday, a man walked into the Zizzi restaurant on The Strand, down the stairs to the basement restaurant area and tried to enter a kitchen. Members of staff stopped him, at which he ran into a second kitchen area. The man then picked up a kitchen knife and slashed himself across the wrist and groin areas before running back into the restaurant, where he continued to stab himself," said a spokesperson for the restaurant.

Surgeons are attempting to reattach his organ in what doctors call the first time this kind of surgery has been performed in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;. It is not yet known if the operation was successful.

"If it doesn't take, then you would have to re-amputate it. Attaching the penis is a very long, complex and painstaking operation," said Francis Chinegwundoh, a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aurologist"&gt;urologist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at St Bartholomew's Hospital which is located in London. Chinegwundoh also said that that the victim will not feel his penis and it will not be possible for him to maintain an erection unless he uses a special machine, even if the operation were a success.

"This astonishing footage captures of one of the world’s most elusive creatures. Tremendous progress has been made in recent years to secure the rhino’s habitat but so much more needs to be done considering this species may very well disappear in the next 10 years," said President and CEO of the World Wildlife Fund in a press release, Carter Roberts.

In the video, the rhino comes out of the jungle brush and then proceeds to sniff the camera and equipment surrounding it. The video also shows the rhino getting a bite to eat.

It is estimated that there are only 25 to 50 of the rhinos alive on the planet, and they can only be found in the jungles of Sabah, or better known as the "Heart of Borneo." For the past 20 years, the rhino has not been reported anywhere else in Sabah and researchers say that it is likely "extinct" in the rest of &lt;a href="w%3AMalaysia"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;.

Researchers say that poaching to use the rhino's horn in medicine and encroachment into their habitats are causing them to decline. Researchers also say that because the rhino is so isolated from the rest of Malaysia, that they are rarely able to breed together.

"The rhino is very sensitive to the presence of human beings. Till now, we can still see the rhino, but if we cannot develop any kind of protection method, I think the rhinos will survive less than 10 years," said a project manager for the WWF for elephants and rhinos in the Borneo region, Raymond Alfred.

In 2006, the first ever still image was captured of the rhino.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia%20national%20cricket%20team"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; have beaten &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Africa%20national%20cricket%20team"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; by 7 wickets in the second Semi-Final match in the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Cricket%20World%20Cup"&gt;World Cup&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3ABeausejour%20Stadium"&gt;Beausejour Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGros%20Islet%20Quarter"&gt;Gros Islet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASaint%20Lucia"&gt;Saint Lucia&lt;/a&gt;.

Australia progress to the Final to play yesterday's winners &lt;a href="w%3ASri%20Lanka%20national%20cricket%20team"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt; with a chance to win their third consecutive title.

After winning the toss, South Africa decided to bat. They lost captain &lt;a href="w%3AGraeme%20Smith"&gt;Smith&lt;/a&gt; in the second over followed by the rest of the top-middle order collapse - including &lt;a href="w%3AGlenn%20McGrath"&gt;McGrath&lt;/a&gt; taking the wickets of &lt;a href="w%3AAshwell%20Prince"&gt;Ashwell Prince&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Boucher"&gt;Mark Boucher&lt;/a&gt; in successive balls. He almost claimed his first World Cup hat-trick but the third ball sailed inches wide of &lt;a href="w%3AJustin%20Kemp"&gt;Justin Kemp's&lt;/a&gt; off stump. 149 is the worst batting performance in this World Cup for South Africa.

Despite losing &lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20Gilchrist"&gt;Adam Gilchrist&lt;/a&gt; in the 2nd over, Australia never really struggled. Helped by another 40 from this year's top scorer &lt;a href="w%3AMatthew%20Hayden"&gt;Matthew Hayden&lt;/a&gt; (who is now only 52 runs behind &lt;a href="w%3ASachin%20Tendulkar"&gt;Sachin Tendulkar's&lt;/a&gt; record of 673 runs in a single World Cup, achieved in 2003) and 60* from &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Clarke%20%28cricketer%29"&gt;Michael Clarke&lt;/a&gt; they eased towards their place in the final inside 32 overs.

<h3>Kryptonite found by geologists</h3>

Geologists in &lt;a href="w%3ASerbia"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt; have found a mineral which matches with &lt;a href="w%3AKryptonite"&gt;Kryptonite&lt;/a&gt;, a fictional rock in the famous ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASuperman"&gt;Superman&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ series. &lt;a href="w%3ANatural%20History%20Museum"&gt;Natural History Museum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%2C%20England"&gt;London, England&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Research%20Council"&gt;National Research Council&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; are calling it a new mineral after tests were done by scientists. The rock is white and powdery and it does not have fluorine and is non-radioactive.

The chemical formula of Kryptonite is sodium lithium boron silicate hydroxide, which British mineralogist Dr. Chris Stanley matched with the rock being held in London's &lt;a href="w%3ANatural%20History%20Museum"&gt;Natural History Museum&lt;/a&gt; after searching on the internet. More information about the new mineral can be found at the Natural History Museum's website.

"I was amazed to discover that same scientific name written on a case of rock containing kryptonite stolen by &lt;a href="w%3ALex%20Luthor"&gt;Lex Luthor&lt;/a&gt; from a museum in the film ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASuperman%20Returns"&gt;Superman Returns&lt;/a&gt;♡❤," he said.

<h3>Parts of Canada's new environment plan revealed</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3AEnvironment"&gt;Environment&lt;/a&gt; Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Baird%20%28Canadian%20politician%29"&gt;John Baird&lt;/a&gt; announced some details today that the Canadian government will reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020. Industrial pollution will be reduced in three to five years and air pollution would be split by 2015.

Baird was expected make his formal announcement on Thursday until, accidentally, the &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Conservative&lt;/a&gt; governments' documents were faxed to the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt;, Canada's main &lt;a href="w%3AOpposition%20%28parliamentary%29"&gt;opposition party&lt;/a&gt;.

This is the second time the Conservative government has made an alternative plan to &lt;a href="w%3AKyoto_Protocol%23Canada"&gt;Kyoto&lt;/a&gt; since 2006. The first one entitled the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AClean%20Air%20Act"&gt;Clean Air Act&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, proposed by former Environment Minister &lt;a href="w%3ARona%20Ambrose"&gt;Rona Ambrose&lt;/a&gt;, was rejected by the two other main opposition parties. The new one is entitled ♡❤Turning the Corner♡❤.

<h3>Rosie O'Donnell to leave ♡❤The View♡❤</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3ARosie%20O%27Donnell"&gt;Rosie O'Donnell&lt;/a&gt; has been ordered to quit &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Broadcasting%20Company"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt;'s ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20View"&gt;The View&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ for not agreeing to her contract. ABC stated they wanted her for three more years but O'Donnell declined saying she wanted only one more year. She will officially leave the popular morning show in June, when her contract agreement ends.

O'Donnell's position has had ups and downs since she started. O'Donnell just this year had two feuds with famous American entrepreneur &lt;a href="w%3ADonald%20Trump"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; and claimed producer and co-host &lt;a href="w%3ABarbara%20Walters"&gt;Barbara Walters&lt;/a&gt; did not come to her side.

She makes a total of US$3 million for co-hosting the show.

"Just didn't dovetail with what ABC was able to offer me. To all the viewers out there, I just want to say thank you for opening up your hearts and your homes to me this past year," O'Donnell said in a formal announcement.

The pentacle was added to the list of 38 emblems allowed on &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; government-issued headstones for soldiers, according to a settlement announced Monday April 23. 

The settlement was in response to a lawsuit brought on behalf of nine families by the advocacy groups &lt;a href="w%3AACLU"&gt;ACLU&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAmericans%20United%20for%20Separation%20of%20Church%20and%20State"&gt;Americans United for Separation of Church and State&lt;/a&gt; (AUSCS). One of these was the family of Sgt. Patrick Stewart, 34, who was killed in Afghanistan, who was posthumously awarded the &lt;a href="w%3ABronze%20Star"&gt;Bronze Star&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APurple%20Heart"&gt;Purple Heart&lt;/a&gt;. His wife Roberta Stewart said in the year prior to the settlement "This is discrimination against our religion".

The Rev. Barry W. Lynn of the AUSCS said: "This settlement has forced the Bush Administration into acknowledging that there are no second class religions in America, including among our nation's veterans."

Wicca is a nature-based religion. Many Wiccans, though not all, include themselves in &lt;a href="w%3ANeopagans"&gt;Paganism&lt;/a&gt; or Neopaganism. There are an estimated one million Neopagans in the world today.

&lt;a href="Thailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;'s draft constitution has come under fire from &lt;a href="w%3ABuddhism"&gt;Buddhist&lt;/a&gt; monks and supporters for not having a clause declaring a national religion for the country. The coup-appointed Prime Minister, &lt;a href="Surayud%20Chulanont"&gt;Surayud Chulanont&lt;/a&gt;, noted that the issue could cause problems with the upcoming referendum to ratify the proposed constitution.

According to the &lt;a href="w%3ABangkok%20Post"&gt;Bangkok Post&lt;/a&gt; 20,000 protesters gathered outside the parliament building in &lt;a href="w%3ABangkok"&gt;Bangkok&lt;/a&gt;, and a procession of nine elephants joined the protest with Senator Sawet Thinnakul riding one of them.

It would appear that the government has carefully worded the draft constitution to avoid favouring one religion over another. Tensions and violence in the predominantly Malay Muslim south of the country have led to over 2,000 deaths; having a clause that recognised Buddhism as the country's official religion may further inflame tensions in the region.

<h3>Anarchist youths attack police station in Athens</h3>

A group of around 30 or 40 anarchists launched an attack against a &lt;a href="w%3Apolice"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; station in Exarchia, a busy district in central &lt;a href="w%3AAthens"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href="w%3AGreece"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, another 70 hooded individuals launched other attacks. They set fire to vehicles, politician’s offices at the &lt;a href="w%3AKolonaki"&gt;Kolonaki&lt;/a&gt; area and various bank departments in Exarhia. &lt;a href="w%3AGreek"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; Riot police responded with tear gas, while the fight between &lt;a href="w%3Aanarchism"&gt;anarchists&lt;/a&gt; and the police still takes place in streets around the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Athens"&gt;University of Athens&lt;/a&gt;. It is believed that the youths launched the attack in order to demonstrate their support to prisoners who started an uprising in three major prisons. Another demonstration takes place in &lt;a href="w%3AThessaloniki"&gt;Thessaloniki&lt;/a&gt;, but without any clashes, so far.

<h3>US Senate bill includes withdrawal date from Iraq</h3>

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;United States Senate&lt;/a&gt; today passed a spending bill that sets a target date of March 31, 2008 for a complete pull-out of &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; forces from &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; has already passed a similar measure. The bill also includes US$100 billion for the continuing operations in Iraq and &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;.

US President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; "will veto this legislation," said &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; spokesperson &lt;a href="w%3ADana%20Perino"&gt;Dana Perino&lt;/a&gt;. "The president is determined to win in Iraq. The bill they sent us today is mission defeated."

<h3>Colombia hit by nationwide power-outage</h3>

&lt;a href="Colombia"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt; was faced with a nationwide electricity outage at 10:15 a.m. local time today. Traffic chaos and people trapped in elevators has been reported. Hospitals and airports continued operations, using their own backup generators.

Speaking on local radio, President &lt;a href="w%3AAlvaro%20Uribe"&gt;Alvaro Uribe&lt;/a&gt; said, "It appears to have affected all of the country."

"The blackout was caused by a failure at an energy substation in northern Bogota. We do not know what type of failure it was," Manuel Maiguashca, vice minister of energy and mines, told reporters. Speculation that the outage was caused by left wing rebels was dismissed by officials.

She told reporters she was fortunate to have been given the opportunity to represent South Australia in the senate and to have seen the Australian government from a number of perspectives. "To have experienced such a range of portfolios and therefore to see the Australian government from so many different perspectives has made the last 10 years an even richer experience," she said.

She declined to comment on rumours that she would be given a diplomatic post to &lt;a href="w%3ARome"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt;, claiming that such decisions are not in her hands.

Earlier today, foreign affairs minister &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Downer"&gt;Alexander Downer&lt;/a&gt; giving no indication of the announcement he was to make this evening, said that Ms Vanstone was a colourful character and her presence on the political scene will be missed. "She's had an impressive political career and has been a good colleague over a long period of time, " said Mr Downer

"She's also been a colourful character in politics, and politics certainly needs its characters."

"Her presence on the political scene will be missed by many Australians."

Other &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt; politicians also paid tribute to Ms Vanstone.

Christopher Pyne, Federal Ageing Minister, said Ms Vanstone was one of the most popular figures in the government.
"I think she's one of the most loved figures in the Howard Government amongst the public," he said

Australian immigration minister &lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Andrews"&gt;Kevin Andrews&lt;/a&gt;, who replaced Ms Vanstone on the front bench in January said Ms Vanstone has made a large contribution to Australia. "We regret that Amanda has resigned, she's made a very significant contribution to Australian life, an enormous contribution through the Parliament and the Senate in particular," he said.

"She's been one of the few women who have ever risen to the rank of Cabinet minister in Australia, that's a major contribution and I wish her the very best in the future."

Alexander Downer this evening confirmed reports that Ms Vanstone will receive a posting in Rome. In a statement he said "Ms Vanstone may take up the position in Rome when the current ambassador's term ends in late June".

Mr Downer said Ms Vanstone would be a valuable asset in Italy. "Amanda Vanstone's long and varied experience as a member of parliament and minister in a range of portfolios will enable her effectively to promote Australia's interests in Italy," he said.

"She will begin pre-posting preparations and consultations as soon as possible."

Two airline pilots said they witnessed &lt;a href="UFO"&gt;UFO&lt;/a&gt;s off the coast of &lt;a href="w%3AAlderney"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt; on Monday. 

Ray Bowyer, 50, a captain with &lt;a href="w%3AAurigny%20Air%20Services"&gt;Aurigny Air Services&lt;/a&gt;, said that during his flight from &lt;a href="w%3ASouthampton"&gt;Southampton, England&lt;/a&gt;, at 3 p.m., he saw a bright-yellow light 10 miles west of Alderney in England. His craft at the time was 30 miles away from the island and had an elevation of 4,000ft.
As Bowyer approached Alderney, he noticed another object identical to the first one.

Bowyer, who has been flying commercial aircrafts for about 20 years, said that he did file a report on the incident and did contact air traffic controllers during the incident.

Paul Kelly, 31, who was the &lt;a href="w%3AJersey%20Airport"&gt;Jersey Airport&lt;/a&gt; air traffic controller on duty during the incident, said that the airport received simultaneous reports from the Aurigny and Blue Island pilot and that the Blue Island pilot had reported a UFO approximately 1,500ft underneath his plane. Kelly noted that the airport was unable to detect the object on their radar.
John Spencer, deputy chairman of the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20UFO%20Research%20Association"&gt;British UFO Research Association&lt;/a&gt;, said: "These types of sightings have been reported by pilots - generally accepted to be reliable and sensible observers - since the 1940s and they have excited attention to this day. Such light effects are often popularly thought to represent alien visitors but many UFO researchers believe they more likely represent natural atmospheric phenomena not yet fully understood by science. However, a similar encounter in 1978 over the Bass Straits in Australia, where the pilot was in radio contact with the ground throughout, resulted in the pilot never being heard from again, so these phenomena are important to study." 

&lt;a href="w%3ANick%20Pope"&gt;Nick Pope&lt;/a&gt;, who previously worked for the &lt;a href="w%3AMinistry%20of%20Defence%20%28United%20Kingdom%29"&gt;United Kingdom Ministry of Defence&lt;/a&gt;, said: "While no witnesses are infallible, pilots are trained observers and less likely than most people to misidentify something mundane. The MoD's UFO case files contain several reports from civil and military pilots, some of which were correlated by radar. This is the sort of sighting that is taken seriously and should be investigated thoroughly. While most UFOs can be explained as misidentifications of aircraft, weather balloons, satellites and suchlike, a small percentage are more difficult to explain. This is one of the most intriguing sightings I've heard about in recent years." 

The current spokesperson for the UK Ministry of Defence said that they would not be investigating this incident.

Congressman &lt;a href="w%3ADennis%20Kucinich"&gt;Dennis Kucinich&lt;/a&gt; (D-Ohio) has submitted a resolution for the &lt;a href="w%3AImpeachment"&gt;impeachment&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; Vice President &lt;a href="w%3ADick%20Cheney"&gt;Dick Cheney.&lt;/a&gt;

Resolution HR 333 contains three articles, the first two holding Cheney responsible for manipulating intelligence to fabricate a threat of &lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20and%20weapons%20of%20mass%20destruction"&gt;Iraqi weapons of mass destruction&lt;/a&gt; and allege a relationship between &lt;a href="w%3ASaddam%20Hussein%20and%20al-Qaeda"&gt;Iraq and al Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;, in order to justify the use of the United States Armed Forces against &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;.

The third article alleges that Cheney has threatened aggression against &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; despite the absence of any real threat from Iran, thus undermining the national security of the US. 

On April 17, Kucinich had sent a letter to his Democratic colleagues saying that he planned to file impeachment proceedings against Cheney, without specifying the charges to be brought. 

Kucinich planned to introduce the impeachment articles on April 24, 2007, but in light of Cheney's surprise doctor's visit to inspect a blood clot, Kucinich decided to postpone the scheduled press conference "until the vice president's condition is clarified."

&lt;a href="w%3AImpeachment%20in%20the%20United%20States"&gt;Impeachment in the United States&lt;/a&gt; may be undertaken only for "treason, bribery and other high crimes and misdemeanors." Congress traditionally regards impeachment as a power to be used only in extreme cases; the House of Representatives has initiated impeachment proceedings only 62 times since 1789. Two cases, including that of former President &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Nixon"&gt;Richard Nixon&lt;/a&gt;, did not come to trial because the individuals had left office.

Actual impeachments of federal officers have taken place only seventeen times.

&lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20McNeil"&gt;Stephen McNeil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMember%20of%20the%20Legislative%20Assembly"&gt;Member of the Legislative Assembly&lt;/a&gt; (MLA) for &lt;a href="w%3AAnnapolis%20%28provincial%20electoral%20district%29"&gt;Annapolis County, Nova Scotia&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, is now the head of an even bigger family.

McNeil, the 12th of 17 children, was voted the new leader of the &lt;a href="w%3ANova%20Scotia%20Liberal%20Party"&gt;Nova Scotia Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3ANova%20Scotia%20Liberal%20Party%20leadership%20election%2C%202007"&gt;leadership convention&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday.

"For the people who said Liberalism in Nova Scotia is on life support, I say look at this room," said McNeil. "The Tory [Conservative] government in Nova Scotia is on life support."

"We know with your support we can be the next government of Nova Scotia," he said.

Just under 1400 delegates came out to the &lt;a href="w%3ADartmouth%20Sportsplex"&gt;Dartmouth, Nova Scotia Sportsplex&lt;/a&gt; to vote for the new leader of the party. McNeil won the leadership on the second ballot, receiving 718 votes. 

The second ballot came down to just McNeil and &lt;a href="w%3ADiana%20Whalen"&gt;Diana Whalen&lt;/a&gt;, MLA for &lt;a href="w%3AHalifax-West"&gt;Halifax-West Clayton Park&lt;/a&gt;. Whalen finished with 650 votes.

McNeil is taking over from interim leader &lt;a href="w%3AMichel%20Samson"&gt;Michel Samson&lt;/a&gt;, who held the position after former leader &lt;a href="w%3AFrancis%20MacKenzie"&gt;Francis MacKenzie&lt;/a&gt; resigned after the dismal 2006 provincial election that left the Liberals with only nine seats. MacKenzie had been leader of the party since 2004.

McNeil has a lofty task before him. The Nova Scotia Liberals have been stuck as a third party for the past eight years. The party has also struggled to fine unity and direction —this was the third Liberal leadership convention since 2002.

"I understand the awesome responsibility I asked for," said McNeil. "This has truly been a great campaign and a rebirth of our party."

The first ballot required a majority of 699 votes to win. McNeil received 571 votes, &lt;a href="w%3AKenzie%20MacKinnon"&gt;Kenzie MacKinnon&lt;/a&gt; 169, &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Smith"&gt;Mike Smith&lt;/a&gt; 255 and Whalen 402.

After the results of the first ballot, fourth-place candidate MacKinnon marched his cheering supporters to the other side of the stadium to lend his support to Whalen. 

There was a dramatic pause as delegates waited to see if Smith would stick around for the second ballot or free his delegates. 

McNeil supporters stood in front on Smith's section and tossed Smith supporters McNeil t-shirts in hopes of gaining their support. Whalen's supporters cheered on the other side.

Then, in a move that surprised many of Smith's supporters, he hugged Whalen and offered her his support.

However, unlike the MacKinnon supporters who waved both "Kenzie" and McNeil placards, Smith's supporters were seen waving Smith/McNeil and Smith/Whalen signs. Support was split. But by the end of the first ballot, McNeil only needed just over a third of the bottom two candidates' supporter's votes to win.

McNeil thanked his competitors after the win, and said he hoped to see Smith and MacKinnon in the legislature after the next election. He also thanked his mother —the woman he credited with introducing him to Liberalism, and his constituency.

"To the people of Annapolis—look how far you've taken this country boy," said McNeil. 

During his campaign, McNeil also promised to hold a youth summit within 30 days on winning the leadership and a presidents' summit within 90 days. He said tomorrow—after his son's confirmation, he would begin work on these two events.

The leadership convention was hosted by the Nova Scotia Federal Liberal Caucus.

After three vote recounts it has been confirmed today for the third time that &lt;a href="w%3AVaughan%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Vaughan, Ontario&lt;/a&gt; mayor &lt;a href="w%3ALinda%20Jackson%20%28politician%29"&gt;Linda Jackson&lt;/a&gt; was elected on the November 13, 2006 election.

A request for a recount was made by former mayor &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Di%20Biase"&gt;Michael Di Biase&lt;/a&gt; after Jackson was elected short of 94 votes. He then requested another one with the city council and received the same result. Di Biase said the electronic voting machines could have made an error. He then declared the votes illegal and void to the &lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20Superior%20Court%20of%20Justice"&gt;Ontario Superior Court&lt;/a&gt; on April 2. The judge just recently requested the third recount. The hand recount, which was done today, came up with the same result.

The recount results are 28,358 votes for Di Biase, 28,448 for Jackson, and 49 disputed.

"This has been very stressful for my family, the staff and the residents of Vaughan," said Jackson. "We're very pleased, we can finally move on."

"I'd like to move forward. I'm glad it's over," Di Biase told reporters.

American actor &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Gere"&gt;Richard Gere&lt;/a&gt;, 51, kissed &lt;a href="India"&gt;Indian&lt;/a&gt; actress &lt;a href="w%3AShilpa%20Shetty"&gt;Shilpa Shetty&lt;/a&gt;, 31, on the cheek several times during an &lt;a href="w%3AAIDS"&gt;AIDS&lt;/a&gt; awareness event in &lt;a href="w%3ADelhi%2C%20India"&gt;Delhi, India&lt;/a&gt;. A court has issued an arrest warrant for both Gere and Shetty for public obscenity.

Gere, who starred in an American remake of the original Japanese version ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AShall%20We%20Dance"&gt;Shall We Dance&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, was doing a &lt;a href="w%3Aballroom"&gt;ballroom&lt;/a&gt; dancing act with Shetty.

"He especially told me to tell the media that he didn't want to hurt any Indian sensibilities," Shetty said.

The act came to issue when a local lawyer complained to a court in &lt;a href="w%3AJaipur%2C%20Rajasthan"&gt;Jaipur, Rajasthan&lt;/a&gt;. It is being called "an obscene act" by the court in Jaipur, Rajasthan. In India, showing affection in public is frowned upon. People in India protested against the act saying it went against their culture.

Gere appeared in an interview with &lt;a href="w%3AJon%20Stewart"&gt;Jon Stewart&lt;/a&gt; on ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Daily%20Show"&gt;The Daily Show&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ last night. "Me kissing the girl on the cheek was nothing," he said. "To be honest, this recent media storm has taken me by complete surprise. End the circus around this episode."
They are scheduled to appear in court on May 5. If convicted, Gere could be fined or sent to jail for three months.

According to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Geological%20Survey"&gt;United States Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3ARichter%20magnitude%20scale"&gt;magnitude&lt;/a&gt; 6.3 earthquake has been recorded in northern &lt;a href="w%3ASumatra"&gt;Sumatra, Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; at 3:02 p.m. local time [08:02 (UTC)].

The &lt;a href="w%3Aepicenter"&gt;epicenter&lt;/a&gt; was approximately 83 kilometers [51 miles] &lt;a href="w%3ACompass%20points"&gt;WSW&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ABanda%20Aceh"&gt;Banda Aceh&lt;/a&gt;, Sumatra, at a depth of 30 kilometers [18.6 miles].

There are no reports of damages, injuries or deaths, according to the Jakarta geophysics agency, but the USGS does report that there is a potential for "light to moderate damage" on the northwest end of the island. 

No tsunami warning has been issued, and according to the &lt;a href="w%3AJakarta"&gt;Jakarta&lt;/a&gt; geophysics agency, no tsunami warning will be issued because the quake did not meet the magnitude 6.5 requirement. Despite there being no tsunami threat, residents started to panic and began to leave their businesses and homes.

In 2004, a massive &lt;a href="w%3Atsunami"&gt;tsunami&lt;/a&gt; struck the island after a magnitude 9.2 quake rattled the region killing over 200,000 people.

One man was killed and 44 hurt in clashes between demonstrators and police in Tallinn, &lt;a href="Estonia"&gt;Estonia&lt;/a&gt; last night after authorities removed a controversial Soviet monument.

The &lt;a href="w%3ABronze%20Soldier%20of%20Tallinn"&gt;Bronze Soldier of Tallinn&lt;/a&gt; is seen as a reminder of Soviet occupation by Estonian nationalists, while veterans and Russian-speaking Estonians view the monument as a symbol of the liberation of Eastern &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3ANazism"&gt;Nazism&lt;/a&gt;. Police special units were used to force away the pro-monument protesters, screaming "Disgrace to Estonia!". 

Police clashed with protesters during the night riots, some cars were burnt, and store front windows in the center of Tallinn were broken by the demonstrators.

&lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; authorities, who often supported the monument as a symbol of victory over fascism, denounced Estonian police actions and the monument removal. &lt;a href="w%3ASergey%20Mironov"&gt;Sergey Mironov&lt;/a&gt;, Russia's parliament speaker, threatened to break the diplomatic relations with Estonia.

According to Russian radio station &lt;a href="w%3AEcho%20of%20Moscow"&gt;♡❤Echo of Moscow♡❤&lt;/a&gt; the number of casualties has increased to three.

<h3>Stephen Hawking goes weightless</h3>

65-year-old scientist &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Hawking"&gt;Stephen Hawking&lt;/a&gt; took a ride on the "&lt;a href="w%3AVomit%20Comet"&gt;Vomit Comet&lt;/a&gt;", an airplane producing weightlessness by following a parabolic flight path. He did this to show awareness for space exploration. The flight took off and landed at the &lt;a href="w%3AKennedy%20Space%20Center"&gt;Kennedy Space Center&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;.

Hawking, who is confined to a wheelchair due to a degenerative disease, was unstrapped from it while the plane made eight free-fall maneuvers that simulate zero-gravity to those on-board. Hawking told reporters he enjoyed the zero-gravity part of his flight and other people with him said he "didn't want to come back".

Hawking made the flight to draw attention to the importance of space exploration. "I believe the human race has no future if it doesn't go into space," he said.

<h3>Saudi Arabia arrests 172 militants</h3>

&lt;a href="Saudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi&lt;/a&gt; police have arrested 172 militants planning to attack Saudi Arabia's oil fields. They also planned to free inmates and use an aircraft.

"They had the personnel, the money, the arms. Almost all the elements for terror attacks were complete except for setting the zero hour for the attacks," said Brig. Mansour al-Turki, a &lt;a href="w%3AInterior%20minister"&gt;Ministry of Interior&lt;/a&gt; spokesperson. "They had reached an advanced stage of readiness and what remained only was to set the zero hour for their attacks."

<h3>Abdullah Gül does not get presidency in first round</h3>
&lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;'s Foreign Minister &lt;a href="w%3AAbdullah%20G%C3%BCl"&gt;Abdullah Gül&lt;/a&gt; failed the first round of voting in parliament on Friday. He received 357 votes; 367 votes are required to win. Opposition parties asked the Constitutional Court to stop the voting. If the Constitutional Court rules in favor, a general election could be called.

A second round will be on May 2. If Gül doesn't pick up the additional ten votes then, the process will move on to a third and if necessary a fourth round. During those rounds, only a simple majority is needed so Gül seems assured of getting the presidency.

<h3>Chinese cat reportedly gives birth to 'poodle'</h3>
A &lt;a href="w%3Acat"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AZhengzhou%2C%20China"&gt;Zhengzhou&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; gave birth to four kittens of which one reportedly looks like a white &lt;a href="w%3Apoodle"&gt;poodle&lt;/a&gt;, says owner Zhang Qiming. People from around the city are making visits to the house where the cat gave birth.

"It looks very different from the other kittens, and its mouth, nose and paws are all dog-like," said owner Zhang Qiming. "Also, its tail is one centimetre shorter than that of the other three kittens."

There appears to be no proof other than the owner's statements that "kitten" is a dog or that the cat in fact gave birth to it.

<h3>Top al-Qaeda operative reported in US custody</h3>

Bryan Whitman, a spokesperson for the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense"&gt;US Department of Defense&lt;/a&gt;, said today that the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; has captured &lt;a href="w%3AAbdul%20Hadi%20al%20Iraqi"&gt;Abdul Hadi al-Iraqi&lt;/a&gt;, whom it says has worked directly with the &lt;a href="w%3ATaliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;.

Whitman said al-Iraqi was captured when trying to enter &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, presumably for the purposes of taking over &lt;a href="w%3AAl-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; operations there. He was taken to &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20Bay%20detention%20camp"&gt;Guantanamo Bay&lt;/a&gt; about a week ago.

A &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20State"&gt;US State Department&lt;/a&gt; website described al-Iraqi as "being a skilled, intelligent, and experienced commander and is an extremely well-respected al-Qaeda leader."

Canadian Heritage Minister &lt;a href="w%3ABev%20Oda"&gt;Bev Oda&lt;/a&gt; has appointed &lt;a href="w%3ATimothy%20Casgrain"&gt;Timothy W. Casgrain&lt;/a&gt; as the new chairman of the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation"&gt;Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)&lt;/a&gt;.

"Mr. Casgrain's credentials will bring strong leadership to the CBC," said Oda. "I am confident that his experience and sound judgement will greatly benefit the CBC."

Casgrain was born in &lt;a href="w%3AMontreal%2C%20Quebec"&gt;Montreal, Quebec&lt;/a&gt; and studied at &lt;a href="w%3AMcGill%20University"&gt;McGill University&lt;/a&gt;. In 1969, he served as a teacher in a small &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;African&lt;/a&gt; town in &lt;a href="w%3AChad"&gt;Chad&lt;/a&gt; for two years. Some years later, he became an accountant. In 1976, he was chairperson of &lt;a href="w%3ASkyservice%20Investments"&gt;Skyservice Investments Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, a Canadian aviation company and was Executive Vice President of the &lt;a href="w%3ABrascan%20Financial%20Corporation"&gt;Brascan Financial Corp&lt;/a&gt;. In 1988, he was President and Chief Executive Officer of &lt;a href="w%3ANBS%20Technologies"&gt;NBS Technologies&lt;/a&gt;.

Since then, Casgrain has served many other positions and has many other honours in his name. Casgrain has been a member of the &lt;a href="w%3AOrder%20of%20Chartered%20Accountants%20of%20Quebec"&gt;Order of Chartered Accountants of Quebec&lt;/a&gt; since 1976 and is the president of the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Sports%20Hall%20of%20Fame"&gt;Canadian Sports Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Former CBC chairman controversy</h2>
This appointment comes after former CBC chairman &lt;a href="w%3AGuy%20Fournier"&gt;Guy Fournier&lt;/a&gt; resigned after making an "offensive" comment about defecation being more pleasurable than sexual intercourse on a French-language &lt;a href="w%3AToronto%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Toronto, Ontario&lt;/a&gt; radio show.

"As you grow older, you continue to go poop once a day if you are in good health, while it is not easy to make love every day. So finally, the pleasure is longer-lasting and more frequent than the other. It is just as heretical as if you read the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Post"&gt;National Post&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ while making love. It is not to be recommended," Fournier said in the interview.

In the 9 September issue of ♡❤7 Jours♡❤, Fournier wrote:

Fournier defended his comment on the &lt;a href="w%3AT%C3%A9l%C3%A9vision%20de%20Radio-Canada"&gt;Radio-Canada&lt;/a&gt; program, ♡❤Tout le monde en parle♡❤.

Fournier resigned over it and the president of the CBC, &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Rabinovitch"&gt;Robert Rabinovitch&lt;/a&gt;, has been serving as chairman ever since.

♡❤San Jose leads series 1-0 (Best of Seven)♡❤

The San Jose Sharks silenced the fans at Joe Louis Arena while stunning the Detroit Red Wings with goals 24 seconds apart.

Matt Carle and Mike Grier scored midway through the first period and Evgeni Nabokov made 34 saves to lead San Jose to a 2-0 victory Thursday night in Game 1 of the Western Conference semifinals.

"We got the crowd right out of the game," said Joe Thornton, who had an assist on the first goal. "That was huge."

Nabokov's shutout was his first this postseason and the fifth of his career in the playoffs. He was tied for second in the NHL with seven during the regular season.

The stellar goaltender said it was important that the Sharks maintained their two-goal lead for the final 2 1/2 periods.

"I guarantee if we would've given up one goal, they would come hard and get the momentum," Nabokov said.

Dominik Hasek had to make just 17 saves because the Sharks played very conservatively after taking the lead, possessing the puck on offense and blocking shots on defense.

"We probably could've pushed a little bit more, but we feel comfortable with 2-0 leads," Thornton said.

Game 2 is Saturday in Detroit.

"You know they're going to certainly bounce back and throw some new wrinkles at us and have a lot more energy in the next game," San Jose coach Ron Wilson said.

Entering the series, home ice was regarded as perhaps the only advantage the top-seeded Red Wings had against the fifth-seeded Sharks.

San Jose quickly took that edge away.

Carle's goal at 9:45 of the first period was set up by a fantastic series of passes around the perimeter, ending with Thornton's cross-crease pass from the corner.

"It was just bing, bang, boom and it was in the back of the net," Thornton said.

The Red Wings put San Jose's powerful power play on the ice for the first goal and lost the puck in their zone to set up the second.

Grier was in the right place when the puck trickled into the slot and he wheeled around and beat Hasek with a slap shot.

"I don't think he knew what he was doing," Hasek said. "He just shot the puck and hit the post and it went in. It was maybe a lucky goal, but if you make a turnover, bad things can happen."

It was a much different start for Detroit after taking 2-0 leads midway through the first period in each of its first two games in the first round against Calgary. The Red Wings won the series in Game 6 after winning all three games at home.

"We would've liked to have a better start, but we made a couple of mistakes and the puck was in the net," Red Wings coach Mike Babcock said.

The Sharks seemed right at home in Detroit, perhaps because they won a league-high and franchise-record 26 games on the road this season and won twice more in Nashville, including the series-winning victory in Game 5 last week.

The Red Wings had three power plays in the second period -- while San Jose didn't have one -- but they took just four shots.

San Jose's swarming defense had a lot to do with that, though Detroit did seem to miss Tomas Holmstrom standing in front of the crease to redirect and shield shots.

"We thought they had four blocked shots on our first power play when we had people in front of the net and the puck never got through," Babcock said.

San Jose blocked 13 shots and took 13 shots through two periods, and finished with 18 blocked shots.

Holmstrom missed the game with an eye injury and the Red Wings were also without defenseman Brett Lebda because of an ankle injury and concussion. With stitches around his left eye, Holmstrom said he hoped to play in the series, but didn't know if he would be ready for Game 2.

Even at full strength, however, Detroit doesn't seem to match up well with the Sharks' combination of depth, size, speed and skill. That appeared to be the case Thursday night and during the regular season, when San Jose won three of four meetings.

The &lt;a href="w%3AMinnesota%20Twins"&gt;Minnesota Twins&lt;/a&gt; faced the &lt;a href="w%3ADetroit%20Tigers"&gt;Detroit Tigers&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3AComerica%20Park"&gt;Comerica Park&lt;/a&gt; Friday in a AL Central Division match-up. Twins starting pitcher &lt;a href="w%3ARamon%20Ortiz"&gt;Ramon Ortiz&lt;/a&gt; gave up five hits and two runs in the six innings he pitched. Tigers starter &lt;a href="w%3ANate%20Robertson"&gt;Nate Robertson&lt;/a&gt; allowed one run in seven innings, but was charged with the two runners that scored for the Twins in the eighth inning.

The Tigers pounced in the third inning; &lt;a href="w%3ACarlos%20Guillen"&gt;Carlos Guillen&lt;/a&gt; singled scoring the veteran &lt;a href="w%3AGary%20Sheffield"&gt;Gary Sheffield&lt;/a&gt;. The Tigers would add one in the sixth with a &lt;a href="w%3ACraig%20Monroe"&gt;Craig Monroe&lt;/a&gt; double, scoring &lt;a href="w%3ASean%20Casey"&gt;Sean Casey&lt;/a&gt;. The Twins would get on the board in the seventh inning, with the lead off hitter &lt;a href="w%3AJustin%20Morneau"&gt;Justin Morneau&lt;/a&gt; sending his first pitch over the left field fence.

But the Twins would rally with a four-run eighth inning, which started with a &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Redmond"&gt;Mike Redmond&lt;/a&gt; single, driving in two runs to tie the game at 3-3. &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Mauer"&gt;Joe Mauer&lt;/a&gt;, who wasn't scheduled to play, pinch hit in the DH spot and brought in the go-ahead run, plus one, giving the Twins a two-run lead. &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Nathan"&gt;Joe Nathan&lt;/a&gt; picked up the save, his seventh of the season.

The middle game of this three-game series will be played tomorrow at noon in Detroit. Starting for Detroit will be &lt;a href="w%3AJustin%20Verlander"&gt;Justin Verlander&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ACarlos%20Silva"&gt;Carlos Silva&lt;/a&gt; will start for Minnesota.

The online news agency ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20NewStandard"&gt;The NewStandard&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ (TNS), a &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt;-based daily dispatch service, ceased publications on Friday, April 27. The not for profit media organization run by the ♡❤PeoplesNetWorks Collective♡❤ out of &lt;a href="w%3ASyracuse%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Syracuse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; was begun in 2004. The 5 staffers that run the collective said that the reason for closure was a "lack of support". 

An announcement made earlier this week on Monday said, 

A Friday email to subscribers again announced that it would be the last daily dispatch, in what the publication called "our unusual endeavor", where ♡❤unusual♡❤ meant because it did not accept advertising revenue for any of its online page content. All ♡❤TNS♡❤ publications were ad free. Premium donors, those who donated &lt;a href="w%3ADollar"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;$10 or more each month, and contributions made by its readership and other organizations, funded the news agency during its 3 and a half year life. In this way, donations were the revenue substitute for advertising dollars. 

♡❤TNS♡❤ came close to shutting down once before, over a year ago. Readers were warned of the pending end, and the publication managed to survive with financial support given by both large donors and small. The publication never took off according to an &lt;a href="w%3AAlexa%20Internet"&gt;Alexa&lt;/a&gt; web traffic ranking result shown in a graph in the 'External links' section below. In comparison to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Washington%20Post"&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, where the line on top in that graph represents their ranking, ♡❤TNS♡❤ was barely on the radar screen. 

The content of the online publication was derived from original and featured article reports written by contributors to the publication who were paid between $125 &amp;mdash; 100 per article. $50 &amp;mdash; $25 was paid to suppliers of news briefs derived mainly from other news agencies, and $25 to cartoonists for their published submissions. Contributors came from all areas of the United States, along with some international.

Cartoonist Daryl Cagle, of CagleCartoons.com, who recently starting posting blog content on emails sent to subscribers of his featured cartoon of the day, blogged Wednesday this week in what he titled, ♡❤ Newspapers and Cartoonists Wandering Blindly♡❤:
Cagle, currently employed by ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMSNBC"&gt;MSNBC.com&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and formerly &lt;a href="w%3ASlate%20%28magazine%29"&gt;Slate&lt;/a&gt;, also remarked that, "I still make my living selling cartoons that are printed in ink on paper from traditional clients who actually pay." He said ♡❤The Washington Post♡❤ is one of the most visited online media outlets to grow out of the newsprint era.

"When The Washington Post Company bought my old employer Slate.com from Microsoft, the negotiations focused on ♡❤Slate♡❤ continuing to receive a huge audience flow from promotions on MSN.com. The Post understands the Web where traffic flows like a river - the river has to keep flowing or the lake will dry up." Cagle said.

The staffers that run ♡❤TNS♡❤ are in the process of wrapping things up and promise to archive as much of the site as possible for future reference, and give a fuller explanation for the site’s closure in this coming week.

A woman by the name of Jeane Palfrey, who worked for ♡❤Pamela Martin♡❤ recently revealed to the media a list of people who are allegedly customers of the call girl company. One of the names on the list is Tobias', according to ABC News.

<h3>McGill University students records made public</h3>

Records at &lt;a href="w%3AMontreal%2C%20Quebec"&gt;Montreal, Quebec&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AMcGill%20University"&gt;McGill University&lt;/a&gt; were made public because of a glitch in their new computer search system, CBC reports.

At a single search of a student, one could find all their transcripts and their marks. Several students that were interviewed by the CBC said they could find transcripts and other students' marks.

CBC contacted the University and they responded quickly.

"As soon as we discovered the breach, we immediately addressed it," deputy provost Morton Mendelson said. "We removed the files, corrected the breach and we are moving forward. We'll take precautions to ensure that analogous problems do not occur again."

<h3>Newfoundland premier in conflict with Prime Minister</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3ANewfoundland%20and%20Labrador"&gt;Newfoundland and Labrador&lt;/a&gt; premier &lt;a href="w%3ADanny%20Williams%20%28politician%29"&gt;Danny Williams&lt;/a&gt; says Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt;'s attitude of &lt;a href="w%3AAtlantic%20Canada"&gt;Atlantic Canada&lt;/a&gt; is that they are a "culture of defeat".

The remarks were in response to Harper's recent comment about the province of Newfoundland and Labrador's budget.

"It sounds like a good Conservative budget to me," Harper said on Tuesday's &lt;a href="w%3AQuestion%20Period"&gt;Question Period&lt;/a&gt;. "It also sounds like Atlantic Canada is having awful rough treatment and it wants it to continue."

"His buddy [U.S. President] &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George Bush&lt;/a&gt; calls him 'Steve', so, you know, I can call him 'Steve'. I'm not a buddy of his," Williams told reporters. "By the same token, I have to basically treat him with the same disdain that he's treating Newfoundlanders and Labradorians."

<h3>Environmentalist David Suzuki says gov't needs to meet Kyoto targets on time</h3>
Environmentalist &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Suzuki"&gt;David Suzuki&lt;/a&gt; said Environment Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Baird"&gt;John Baird&lt;/a&gt;'s new environmental plan, entitled ♡❤Turning the Corner♡❤, an alternative plan to &lt;a href="w%3AKyoto%20Protocol%23Canada"&gt;Kyoto&lt;/a&gt;, needs to meet its requirements on time. The Conservatives say the new environmental plan will miss the deadline by years.
"Mr. Baird, you are the minister of the environment, not the minister of finance," Suzuki said. "Your job is to protect the environment."

Baird said it will still work out even if it will miss the Kyoto deadline. He also blames the Liberals for not having a plan before the Conservatives were elected.

Baird just recently unveiled the new plan on Thursday. He also unveiled some details on Wednesday about the plan before making his formal announcement on Thursday, after the Conservative governments' documents were accidentally faxed to the Liberal Party.

&lt;a href="w%3ASaint%20Paul%2C%20Minnesota"&gt;Saint Paul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Minnesota"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; Mayor &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Coleman%20%28politician%29"&gt;Chris Coleman&lt;/a&gt; had a close encounter with a drunk driver Thursday evening when he was rear-ended. The car wasn't traveling much faster than 10 miles per hour, but the driver registered with a 0.26 blood alcohol level, over twice the legal limit.

Mayor Coleman was traveling in a city vehicle and accompanied by a police escort when they stopped at a red light at Victoria and Summit Avenues. At approximately 8:40pm, it was struck by the vehicle of Abbie Raymond, a 22-year-old St. Paul student, who was arrested at the scene. She was booked into the &lt;a href="w%3ARamsey%20County%2C%20Minnesota"&gt;Ramsey County&lt;/a&gt; Jail under gross misdemeanor charges of driving while intoxicated. Raymond is a student at the William Mitchell School of Law. She was traveling with a passenger, another woman in her early 20s who may have also been intoxicated. They had been coming from a nearby bar or restaurant.

"The mayor is pleased there were no injuries," said Bob Hume, a spokesman for the mayor. Both vehicles suffered only minor damage.

<h1>Australia defeats Sri Lanka in 2007 Cricket World Cup Final</h1>

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia%20national%20cricket%20team"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; have defeated &lt;a href="w%3ASri%20Lanka%20national%20cricket%20team"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt; by 53 runs (&lt;a href="w%3ADuckworth-Lewis%20method"&gt;DL method&lt;/a&gt;) in the Final of the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Cricket%20World%20Cup"&gt;World Cup&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AKensington%20Oval"&gt;Kensington Oval&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABridgetown"&gt;Bridgetown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABarbados"&gt;Barbados&lt;/a&gt;, giving them their third successive title.

&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; progressed to the final without losing a single match - their smallest victory was still by a reasonable 83 runs against &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Africa%20national%20cricket%20team"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; in the group stages.

&lt;a href="Sri%20Lanka"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt; lost twice on their way to the final, first against South Africa in their first game of the Super 8s, made famous due to &lt;a href="w%3ALasith%20Malinga"&gt;Lasith Malinga's&lt;/a&gt; 4 wickets in 4 balls, though Sri Lanka went on to lose by 1 wicket anyway. Their other loss came against today's opponents Australia, however they rested 2 of their main bowlers (Muttiah Muralitharan and Charminda Vaas), as well as strike bowler Lasith Malinga being out injured at the time. All 3 bowlers are expected to be in the squad today, giving Australia a different challenge today.

This is a repeat of the &lt;a href="w%3A1996%20Cricket%20World%20Cup"&gt;1996 World Cup Final&lt;/a&gt; which Sri Lanka won - however Australia have won both World Cups since, in 1999 and 2003, and have beaten Sri Lanka in every other World Cup match they have faced.

&lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20Gilchrist"&gt;Gilchrist&lt;/a&gt; played an incredible innings of 149 - the highest for any batsman in a World Cup final - to give Australia an imposing total going in at to break. Hayden fell for 38, leaving him just 14 runs short of &lt;a href="w%3ASachin%20Tendulkar"&gt;Sachin Tendulkar's&lt;/a&gt; record of 673 in a single World Cup, set in 2003.

The match almost concluded in confusing circumstances: the game had run on late, having been reduced to 38 overs a side initially and later 36 overs for Sri Lanka, and bad light ended up stopping play with Sri Lanka's agreement, despite having 3 wickets left in hand and 18 balls left to bowl.

The Australians began to celebrate the win before the match officials informed them, incorrectly, that the remaining three overs still had to be bowled. If light conditions were not good enough for play to resume then they would have to wait for the next day to complete the match. Eventually the Sri Lankan captain sent his batsmen back out to play in near-complete darkness, the Australian captain agreeing to only allow spinners to bowl for the safety of the batsmen.

The final 3 overs were eventually bowled but nothing really changed: Malinga was stumped and sent on his way by Man of the Match Gilchrist but the balls slowly ran out and Australia stormed home to win the tournament.

According to the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Geological%20Survey"&gt;Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt;, an earthquake of magnitude 4.7 struck at 07:18:11 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt; (08:18:11 local time) in &lt;a href="w%3AKent"&gt;Kent&lt;/a&gt; located in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. However, the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Geological%20Survey"&gt;British Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt; reports the quake at a magnitude of 4.3, and ♡❤Sky News♡❤ reports that the quake had a magnitude of 5.0.

The &lt;a href="w%3Aepicenter"&gt;epicenter&lt;/a&gt; was located 25 km [15 miles] south of &lt;a href="w%3ACanterbury"&gt;Canterbury&lt;/a&gt; and was at a depth of 10 km [6.2 miles].

The earthquake occurred close to the entrance of the &lt;a href="w%3AChannel%20Tunnel"&gt;Channel Tunnel&lt;/a&gt; at Folkestone, although there are no reports of damage to the tunnel. A spokesman for &lt;a href="w%3AEurostar"&gt;Eurostar&lt;/a&gt;, the high-speed train service running through the undersea tunnel, said the quake has had no effect on their services. 

&lt;a href="w%3AKent%20Fire%20and%20Rescue%20Service"&gt;Kent Fire and Rescue Service&lt;/a&gt; claimed to have received calls from residents who say electricity and telephones are out of service. Some residents report cracks in homes and collapsed chimneys. Residents have been evacuated from their homes and businesses, and officials have shut off some natural gas and electric supplies as a precaution.

"We have had calls from people saying their chimneys have fallen down, large cracks in people's houses," said a spokesman for the Kent Fire and Rescue Services, but ♡❤The Daily Star♡❤ reports that the quake caused "widespread damage" to homes and businesses.

It has been reported that at least one person has required hospital treatment.

According to BBC News Online more than 300 people were detained and at least 10 hurt after a second night of riots in &lt;a href="Estonia"&gt;Estonia&lt;/a&gt;'s capital, Tallinn. 

Clashes began last night after Estonian authorities removed a controversial Soviet monument, the &lt;a href="w%3ABronze%20Soldier%20of%20Tallinn"&gt;Bronze Soldier of Tallinn&lt;/a&gt;, which Russian-speaking Estonians see as a symbol of the liberation of Eastern Europe from Nazism, while Estonian nationalists view it as a reminder of Soviet occupation.

&lt;a href="w%3AGrammy%20Award"&gt;Grammy Award&lt;/a&gt;-winning rock band &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20White%20Stripes"&gt;The White Stripes&lt;/a&gt; announced on Wednesday the Canadian leg of a tour in support of their soon-to-be-released album, &lt;a href="w%3AIcky%20Thump"&gt;♡❤Icky Thump♡❤&lt;/a&gt;. The tour, which would be the first cross-Canada excursion for The White Stripes, will see the band play dates in all provinces and territories.

The latest tour for The White Stripes will kick off June 1 in &lt;a href="w%3AN%C3%BCrburgring"&gt;Nürburgring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; and will play several dates in Europe before starting off in &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; on June 24, in &lt;a href="w%3ABurnaby%2C%20British%20Columbia"&gt;Burnaby&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Columbia"&gt;British Columbia&lt;/a&gt;. Canadian dates will include stops in northern locales such as &lt;a href="w%3AWhitehorse%2C%20Yukon"&gt;Whitehorse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AYellowknife%2C%20Northwest%20Territories"&gt;Yellowknife&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AIqaluit"&gt;Iqaluit&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href="w%3ABaffin%20Island"&gt;Baffin Island&lt;/a&gt;.

The White Stripes, made up of guitarist/singer &lt;a href="w%3AJack%20White"&gt;Jack White&lt;/a&gt; and drummer &lt;a href="w%3AMeg%20White"&gt;Meg White&lt;/a&gt;, have developed a significant worldwide following with their blend of punk and blues, guitar-oriented rock. The band had expressed interest in playing cities they had not yet visited. "Having never done a full tour of Canada, Meg and I thought it was high time to go whole hog," said Jack White on The White Stripes website. "We want to take this tour to the far reaches of the Canadian landscape. From the ocean to the permafrost." The band's website referred to Canada by its nickname, the 'Great White North'.

The White Stripes have played to thousands in large outdoor festival settings, but will have to deal with different logistics while setting up in a northern location, such as Iqaluit.

Some 500 tickets for the Iqaluit show are to be sold, with an admission fee of approximately CA$40. Mike Bozzer, the city of Iqaluit's economic development officer, told &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation"&gt;♡❤CBC News♡❤&lt;/a&gt; that talks have taken place with The White Stripes' publicist regarding equipment, technicians, security and other such details. "It's definitely going to have some economic impact, and they'll come back home with positive stories of the city," said Bozzer.

The band's ten-year anniversary will be reached at a point during the Canadian leg of the tour, which will be commemorated. "Another special moment of this tour is the show which will occur in &lt;a href="w%3AGlace%20Bay%2C%20Nova%20Scotia"&gt;Glace Bay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANova%20Scotia"&gt;Nova Scotia&lt;/a&gt; on July 14th, The White Stripes’ Tenth Anniversary," said Jack White.

Following the Canadian dates, The White Stripes will embark on a tour in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, which will reach some 16 states they have not yet visited during their career, among other repeat locations.

&lt;a href="Azerbaijan"&gt;Azerbaijan&lt;/a&gt;-born &lt;a href="w%3Acellist"&gt;cellist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AConducting"&gt;conductor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMstislav%20Rostropovich"&gt;Mstislav Rostropovich&lt;/a&gt; (nicknamed ♡❤Slava♡❤, &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n for glory) has passed yesterday at age 80, after having been admitted to a &lt;a href="w%3AMoscow"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt; hospital in February this year, allegedly for intestinal cancer. The exact cause of death however has not been released. His coffin has been put in the Moscow Conservatory today, and many prominent and thousands of other Russians came to salute him. The cello player only died four days after his friend &lt;a href="Boris%20Yeltsin"&gt;Boris Yeltsin&lt;/a&gt;.

Rostropovich was not only considered to be one of the best cellists in the world, but he also was a symbol of the resistance to the &lt;a href="w%3ASoviet%20Union"&gt;Soviet regime&lt;/a&gt;. In 1970, he provided shelter to &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Solzhenitsyn"&gt;Alexander Solzhenitsyn&lt;/a&gt;, whose writings alerted the world to the &lt;a href="w%3AGulag"&gt;Gulag&lt;/a&gt; system of forced labour camps in the Soviet Union. Because of his support for dissidents, Rostropovich fell in disgrace and lost his citizenship in 1978. He was restored during the &lt;a href="w%3APerestroika"&gt;perestroika&lt;/a&gt; reforms.

Rostropovich conducted the &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Symphony%20Orchestra%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;National Symphony Orchestra&lt;/a&gt; from 1977 to 1994. In February, Russian President &lt;a href="Vladimir%20Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; offered him the First Degree in the Order of Service to the Fatherland for his "outstanding contribution to the development of world music and many years of creative activity."

President Putin, Alexander Solzhenitsyn, French PM &lt;a href="w%3ADominique%20de%20Villepin"&gt;Dominique de Villepin&lt;/a&gt; and others have already expressed their regrets about the loss of Rostropovich. De Villepin brought to memory Rostropovich's performance at the &lt;a href="w%3ABerlin%20Wall"&gt;Berlin Wall&lt;/a&gt; during it's fall, an image globally broadcasted which earned him international fame.

<h1>Canadian inspectors to test food ingredients from China</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Canadian%20inspectors%20to%20test%20food%20ingredients%20from%20China&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Food%20Inspection%20Agency"&gt;Canadian Food Inspection Agency&lt;/a&gt; (CFIA) has issued border alerts for specific protein ingredients, imported from &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, that may be incorporated into products destined for human consumption.

Inspectors from the &lt;a href="w%3ACanada%20Border%20Services%20Agency"&gt;Canada Border Services Agency&lt;/a&gt; (CBSA) will hold products, such as wheat and corn gluten, as well as soy and rice proteins until they can be tested for &lt;a href="w%3AMelamine"&gt;melamine&lt;/a&gt;, the contaminant found to have sickened pets through its use in pet food. If determined to be free of melamine, the ingredients will be released to the intended recipient. Materials such as glutens and protein powders are used commonly in many forms of food products.

The CFIA said it was not acting on specific information, but rather taking a cautious approach to human protection. "That's why we have the border lookout for the ingredient, so that we can proactively assess any potential that the product is contaminated," Paul Mayers of the CFIA told &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation"&gt;♡❤CBC News♡❤&lt;/a&gt;.

Since the border alert for melamine is a new procedure, the government can't be sure if the contaminant made it into the food chain previously. The CFIA acknowledged that the same Chinese company under suspicion in the tainted pet food affair had shipped wheat gluten to a Canadian company, which in turn used it in food for fish farms. Although the fish were subsequently eaten by people, the CFIA believes the health risk from such consumption would be low.

In related news, Canadian researchers at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Guelph"&gt;University of Guelph&lt;/a&gt; believe they may have determined the mechanism of how melamine caused illness in cats and dogs.

Both &lt;a href="w%3ACyanuric%20acid"&gt;cyanuric acid&lt;/a&gt; and melamine were found in urine samples from pets that died after consuming contaminated pet food. The two compounds react with one another to form crystals that may block kidney function, researchers at the university said. The researchers observed crystals formed in cat urine by the addition of melamine and cyanuric acid. The composition of these crystals matches those found in the urine of affected pets when compared by &lt;a href="w%3AInfrared%20spectroscopy"&gt;infrared spectroscopy&lt;/a&gt; (FTIR).

"You wouldn't normally expect to find those compounds in pet food, and hence nobody was really looking for it," said John Melichercik, director of analytical laboratory services. "It's just another piece of the puzzle along the way in this particular pet-food issue."

&lt;a href="Belgium"&gt;Belgian&lt;/a&gt; Federal prosecutor Johan Delmulle has said in an interview published in the &lt;a href="w%3AFlanders"&gt;Flemish&lt;/a&gt; newspaper &lt;a href="w%3ADe%20Tijd"&gt;♡❤De Tijd♡❤&lt;/a&gt; today that the Federal police are investigating a possible &lt;a href="w%3Aterrorism"&gt;terrorist&lt;/a&gt; group that recruits Belgians to commit &lt;a href="w%3ASuicide%20attack"&gt;suicide attacks&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;.

According to Delmulle, the Federal police started a record 106 new terrorism inquiries last year, compared to 89 in 2005, and 134 between 2004 and 2002. The trend also confirms itself in 26 cases that were handed over to the courts in 2006, compared to 14 the year before. The majority, ♡❤i.e.♡❤ 17 of those cases, concerned terrorist cells that were located in the capital city of &lt;a href="w%3ABrussels"&gt;Brussels&lt;/a&gt;.

The cases drew from 318 messages of possible terrorist activities that were received in 2006. Every single case was reviewed carefully, according to Delmulle: "We treat every report as if a real terrorist attack was pending. The margin of error has to be zero." In an interview with TV-station &lt;a href="w%3AVlaamse%20Televisie%20Maatschappij"&gt;VTM&lt;/a&gt;, Delmulle attributed the increasing reports on terrorism to the increased attention for the phenomenon, and not to an increased terror threat.

The federal prosecutor told ♡❤De Tijd♡❤ that Belgium mostly has to deal with "sleeping &lt;a href="w%3ACovert%20cell"&gt;terrorist cell&lt;/a&gt;s":

Delmulle told VTM he wanted the next Justice Minister to deal with the fact that the names of investigators are mentioned in judicial files. According to the prosecutor, people in the terrorist environment are trying to get a hold on names and locations of inspectors, information about their families and so on, which in turn leads to actual threats. Delmulle himself has been under police protection for the last 5 months because he is the prosecutor in the case of Ferye Erdal and other members of the &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt; resistance group DHKPC.

&lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;i Federal Interior Minister &lt;a href="w%3AAftab%20Ahmad%20Khan%20Sherpao"&gt;Aftab Ahmad Khan Sherpao&lt;/a&gt; narrowly escaped a suicide bomb attack today. Sherpao was speaking at a rally in his home village in &lt;a href="w%3ACharsadda%20District"&gt;Charsadda District&lt;/a&gt; when the suicide bomber struck, killing 25 people and injuring dozens more at last count.

NWFP Inspector General of Police Sharif Virk said five policemen were among the 25 dead. 

According to the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ADaily%20Times%20%28Pakistan%29"&gt;Daily Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤: “Sherpao was going towards his vehicle after finishing his speech and people also rushed towards him for hand-shakes and during this moment I heard a big bang,” said Ayub, who was injured in the blast, from his hospital bed. “It was a big explosion sending a thick cloud of dust to the air,” Wajid Khan, another witness, told ♡❤Daily Times♡❤ by phone from Charsadda. 

Sherpao in a statement afterwards issued a statement condemning the attack calling it a "targeted kill".

According to news reports, intelligence services had only recently beefed up security on the Interior Minister due to intelligence reports about an imminent attack.

Approval has been given to the BBC (&lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Broadcasting%20Corporation"&gt;British Broadcasting Corporation&lt;/a&gt;) by the &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20Trust"&gt;BBC Trust&lt;/a&gt; to go ahead with a proposal that would allow satellite TV to be "subscription free."

♡❤Freesat♡❤ will have no monthly subscription fee, and according to the BBC, the new system would "require a one-off payment for reception equipment."

"Envisaged as a joint venture, Freesat will ensure the public remain in control of how they access the BBC's television channels and radio networks for which they have already paid. It is guaranteed to remain subscription free, ensuring that the benefits of digital television do not equal 'pay television'," said Chitra Bharucha, the acting Chairman of the BBC Trust.

The service will be offered to anyone who is unable to watch digital TV from the current provider, ♡❤Freeview,♡❤ which is not available to at least 25% of people in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; who watch or have a TV.

"Its [Freesat's] primary purpose is to drive digital take-up in analogue homes, particularly in those areas which are out of digital terrestrial coverage," said &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Thompson"&gt;Mark Thompson&lt;/a&gt;, the Director-General of the BBC.

♡❤Freesat♡❤ will also be jointly operated by &lt;a href="w%3AITV"&gt;ITV&lt;/a&gt;. It is expected to launch in 2008 and is scheduled to be completed in 2012. The service will be installed "region by region," according to the BBC.

The Governor of the state of &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Eliot%20Spitzer"&gt;Eliot Spitzer&lt;/a&gt;, is proposing a bill that would make same-sex marriages legal in the state.

"This legislation would create equal legal protection and responsibilities for all individuals who seek to marry or have their marriage protected in the state of New York. Strong, stable families are the cornerstones of our society. The responsibilities inherent in the institution of marriage benefit those individuals and society as a whole," said Spitzer in a statement he issued to the press.

Although Spitzer said that the time to propose the bill "is right," he doubts that it will pass the state legislature.

"I do not think there is a realistic shot that it gets passed, but I will submit it because it's a statement of principle that I believe in and I want to begin that dynamic," added Spitzer.

The bill states that it would "establish equal responsibilities, recognition, benefits and protections for all married couples [and] would additionally stipulate that no clergy member or religious institution should be compelled to perform any same-sex marriage ceremony."

Currently, same-sex marriages are only legal in the state of &lt;a href="Massachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACivil%20union"&gt;Civil unions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , are only legal in &lt;a href="Connecticut"&gt;Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20Jersey"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Vermont"&gt;Vermont&lt;/a&gt; and domestic partnerships are currently only legal in the states of &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Maine"&gt;Maine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Washington%20%28state%29"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href="New%20York%2C%20New%20York"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Washington%20D.C."&gt;Washington D.C.&lt;/a&gt;, domestic partnerships are also legal.

&lt;a href="w%3ATelecom%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Telecom New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; has apologised to Gay Hamilton after her &lt;a href="w%3Ae-mail"&gt;e-mail&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href="w%3ABounce%20message"&gt;bounced&lt;/a&gt; because it contained the word &lt;a href="w%3Agay"&gt;gay&lt;/a&gt; eight times. The automatic reply Ms Hamilton received stated that the e-mail was not suited for "business-like communication".

Website designer and lesbian, Gay Hamilton had sent the largest public company in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; a message to their help desk via e-mail, asking if she was able to receive their broadband services in her Nelson suburb.

Lenska Papich, spokesperson for Telecom, has said that e-mails are usually only monitored internally, and the words are blocked to help reduce harassment cases by threatening disciplinary action. "Our systems internally detect a number of words, including both the words gay and heterosexual, that could be deemed as inappropriate for use at work." Telecom refused to list the other words that are blocked.

Ms Hamilton has said that she is worried about the amount of time and effort Telecom must have put into deciding that gay was an inappropriate word in e-mail communication. "If they do have to put content filters on, then maybe they should ensure that it only gets genuinely abusive words."

Ms Hamilton has been apologised to by Lenska Papich, who said that she was very good about it all.

At least 45 people are reported to have eaten &lt;a href="w%3Apork"&gt;pork&lt;/a&gt; which came from a hog farm in &lt;a href="w%3ACeres%2C%20California"&gt;Ceres, California&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, where pigs from the farm were fed pet food which was recalled because it was contaminated with the chemical &lt;a href="w%3Amelamine"&gt;melamine&lt;/a&gt;.

So far none of the individuals have experienced signs of illnesses, but it is not known what effect the chemical, when ingested, has on humans because no major study has taken place on melamine.

On April 21, at least seven urine samples taken from pigs at hog farm, were tested and the results came back positive for the chemical melamine. At least three samples from the feed used to feed the pigs were tested and those results also came back positive for melamine.

Yesterday, the United States &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration"&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; or FDA, said in a statement that "we have no evidence of harm to humans associated with the processed pork product" and that "no recall of meat products processed from these animals is being issued."

Despite the consumption of pork by humans, the FDA states that the risk to human health is minimal.

"The assessment that, if there were to be harm to human health, it would be very low, is based on a number of factors, including the dilution of the contaminating melamine and melamine-related compounds from the original rice protein concentrate as it moves through the food system. First it is a partial ingredient in the pet food; second, it is only part of the total feed given to the hogs; third, it is not known to accumulate in the hogs and the hogs excrete melamine in their urine; fourth, even if present in pork, pork is only a small part of the average American diet. Neither FDA nor USDA has uncovered any evidence of harm to the swine from the contaminated feed," added the statement.

On March 19, the manufacturer of the food, Menu Foods, which is based in &lt;a href="w%3AMississauga%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Mississauga, Ontario&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, recalled all of its dog and cat food which totaled over 60 million items. On April 28, Canadian officials announced that they will hold products, such as wheat and corn gluten, as well as soy and rice proteins that have been imported from &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; until they can be tested for melamine.

It is not known how extensive the outbreak is.

A &lt;a href="w%3Atanker%20truck"&gt;tanker truck&lt;/a&gt; carrying approximately 8,600 gallons of &lt;a href="w%3Aunleaded%20gasoline"&gt;unleaded gasoline&lt;/a&gt; caught on fire on the Interstate &lt;a href="w%3AI-80"&gt;80&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="w%3AI-880"&gt;880&lt;/a&gt; interchange in &lt;a href="w%3AOakland%2C%20California"&gt;Oakland, California&lt;/a&gt; early Sunday morning around 3:40 AM. The fire resulted in the collapse of at least two sections of bridges at the interchange, including one carrying I-580. The multi-level freeway interchange known as the &lt;a href="w%3AMacArthur%20Maze"&gt;MacArthur Maze&lt;/a&gt; connects the Bay Bridge (Interstate 80) to Interstates 580, 880, and 980 and California State Highway 24, and as such it connects several major cities in California, including San Francisco, Oakland, and Berkeley.

The driver, James Mosqueda, 51, of &lt;a href="w%3AWoodland%2C%20California"&gt;Woodland, California&lt;/a&gt;, escaped from his truck before the fire. He was the only person reported to be hurt, suffering second-degree burns. No other vehicles were involved in the crash.

The driver was believed to be speeding, resulting in a loss of control of the truck, causing it to flip over and subsequently burst into flames. As the truck was traveling on the interchange of I-80 eastbound to I-880 southbound near the San Francisco Bay Bridge, it is speculated to have hit a guard rail or column during a turn. Shortly thereafter, it exploded into a fire that lasted several hours.

&lt;a href="w%3ACaltrans"&gt;Caltrans&lt;/a&gt; officials have announced that repairs will be fast-tracked, but will still take several weeks. Public transit has responded with plans to increase service and re-route buses that used the destroyed interchange.

&lt;a href="w%3AArnold%20Schwarzenegger"&gt;Gov. Schwarzenegger&lt;/a&gt; has declared a state of emergency that in addition to expediting repairs will suspend restrictions on truck traffic hours and provide free use of area public transportation on Monday, April 30.

<h1>Protests in Turkey over Presidential candidate</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Protests%20in%20Turkey%20over%20Presidential%20candidate&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Hundreds of thousands of &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turks&lt;/a&gt; rallied again in Turkey's largest city, &lt;a href="w%3AIstanbul"&gt;Istanbul&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday to protest &lt;a href="w%3AAbdullah%20G%C3%BCl"&gt;Abdullah Gül's&lt;/a&gt; presidential candidacy, which they fear would threaten Turkey's separation between religious and state affairs.

The "&lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20Protests"&gt;Çağlayan Demonstration for the Republic&lt;/a&gt;" was centered around the Çağlayan Square. While security forces estimated the number of demonstrators at 700 000, estimates around 1 million and more are reported in the Turkish media.

The scene of the previous "Protect your Republic" demonstration in Turkey's capital &lt;a href="w%3AAnkara"&gt;Ankara&lt;/a&gt; was repeated, with uncountable Turkish flags and many posters of &lt;a href="w%3AMustafa%20Kemal%20Atat%C3%BCrk"&gt;Atatürk&lt;/a&gt;, founder of the modern Turkish state. The protesters shouted slogans like: "Turkey is secular and will remain secular!".

The demonstrators fear that current Foreign Minister Abdullah Gül, the presidential candidate of the ruling AK Party of Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ARecep%20Tayyip%20Erdo%C4%9Fan"&gt;Erdoğan&lt;/a&gt;, will allow Islamic influences in Turkey to become more powerful. The party officially denies having such a hidden agenda.

The army, traditionally loyal to the Turkish pro-secular side, accused the government on Friday of tolerating radical &lt;a href="Islam"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;. But Gül replied: "It is out of the question to withdraw my candidacy." In 1997 the democratically elected Islamic-oriented President &lt;a href="w%3ANecmettin%20Erbakan"&gt;Necmettin Erbakan&lt;/a&gt; was removed from office by the army, with public support.

In Turkey, the president is elected directly by the parliament, and Gül failed to get elected in the first round of the elections, when opposition lawmakers boycotted the vote. The opposition also appealed to the Constitutional Court to declare the process unlawful. A second round is to be held on Wednesday, and a third one on May 9.

Gül's wife Hayrunisa wears a head scarf and has appealed to the European Court of Human Rights to be allowed to wear it at a university. But secular Turks want to keep the current ban on wearing such scarves in public places.

<h2>Reactions</h2>

Prime Minister Erdoğan in a national television address on Monday called for national unity: "Unity, togetherness, solidarity, these are the things we need most. We can overcome many problems so long as we treat each other with love."

"Even four and a half years ago, this country was riven by serious problems, which thank goodness have been overcome one by one," the Prime Minister said, referring to the many reforms his government has implemented since it came into power. He also pointed out Turkey's steady growth rate during the last years. To maintain this, he asked the nation for stability: "At this point, it's enough that we protect the environment of stability, it's enough that we protect the environment of peace. Enough that we don't harm the environment of confidence we have worked so hard to attain."

In reaction to the ongoing uncertainty, the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;E.U.&lt;/a&gt; enlargement commissioner warned the Turkish Army about interfering: “It is important that the military leaves the remit of democracy to the democratically-elected government and this is the test case if the Turkish armed forces respect democratic secularism and the democratic arrangement of civil-military relations,” commissioner Olli Rehn said. Erdoğan and Gül support Turkey's efforts to join the European Union.

The Turkish stock market lost 4,01 per cent on Monday, which analysts attribute to the current political crisis.

<h1>Justin Trudeau wins Liberal Party nomination</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Justin%20Trudeau%20wins%20Liberal%20Party%20nomination&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3AJustin%20Trudeau"&gt;Justin Trudeau&lt;/a&gt;, son of the late Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3APierre%20Trudeau"&gt;Pierre Trudeau&lt;/a&gt;, has won his &lt;a href="w%3ARiding%23Canada"&gt;riding&lt;/a&gt; nomination for the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Liberal Party of Canada&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3APapineau%20%28electoral%20district%29"&gt;Papineau, Montreal, Quebec&lt;/a&gt;. To win he needed 634 votes. He received 690.

This is his first attempt at running for politics. His father was &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Canada"&gt;Prime Minister of Canada&lt;/a&gt; from the 1960s until the mid-1980s.

His two other competitors for the nomination were natives from the town; &lt;a href="w%3AMary%20Deros"&gt;Mary Deros&lt;/a&gt;, a city councillor and &lt;a href="w%3ABasilio%20Giordano"&gt;Basilio Giordano&lt;/a&gt;, a former city councillor and journalist for a local Italian newspaper. Competitors for the other federal party's have not yet been chosen. According to reports Deros received 350 votes and Basilio Giordano received 220.

Trudeau will run in the &lt;a href="w%3A40th%20Canadian%20federal%20election"&gt;40th Canadian federal election&lt;/a&gt;, which must be called no later than February 13, 2011.

"I'm a teacher; I'm a convenor; I'm a gatherer; I'm someone who reaches out to people and is deeply interested in what they have to say," Trudeau said. "And people see that I'm not faking it. I'm actually genuinely committed to this dialogue that we're opening up, and this understanding that needs to happen in order to be an effective MP."

Trudeau does not live in Papineau. It is the poorest riding in Canada and the smallest. It consists of blue-collar residents.

The riding has a long history of Liberal MPs. In the 1949 federal election an Independent MP held the riding. Liberal &lt;a href="w%3AAdrien%20Meunier"&gt;Adrien Meunier&lt;/a&gt; was re-elected three times holding the riding from 1949 to 1962. Liberal &lt;a href="w%3AGuy%20Favreau"&gt;Guy Favreau&lt;/a&gt; was re-elected once holding the riding from 1963 to 1965. Liberal &lt;a href="w%3AAndr%C3%A9%20Ouellet"&gt;André Ouellet&lt;/a&gt; was re-elected six times holding the riding from 1967 to 1984. Liberal &lt;a href="w%3APierre%20Pettigrew"&gt;Pierre Pettigrew&lt;/a&gt; was elected in 2004, he came in second to current &lt;a href="w%3ABloc%20Qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois"&gt;Bloc Québécois&lt;/a&gt; MP &lt;a href="w%3AVivian%20Barbot"&gt;Vivian Barbot&lt;/a&gt;, who won by 17,775 votes.

Trudeau, 35, is the second child born to a Prime Minister during his term in office to Canada's first, &lt;a href="w%3ASir%20John%20A.%20Macdonald"&gt;Sir John A. Macdonald&lt;/a&gt;, who had a his daughter Margaret Mary Macdonald during his time in office. He has a Bachelor of Arts of English literature from &lt;a href="w%3AMontreal%2C%20Quebec"&gt;Montreal&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AMcGill%20University"&gt;McGill University&lt;/a&gt; and the Bachelor of Education from the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20British%20Columbia"&gt;University of British Columbia&lt;/a&gt;. He eventually became a teacher there.

He married French-Canadian television personality &lt;a href="w%3ASophie%20Gr%C3%A9goire"&gt;Sophie Grégoire&lt;/a&gt; on March 18, 2005. In April this year they announced they are expecting their first child. Since his youngest sibling &lt;a href="w%3AMichel%20Trudeau"&gt;Michel Trudeau&lt;/a&gt; died in an avalanche in 1998, Trudeau has been an active campaigner for winter sports safety. His younger brother &lt;a href="w%3AAlexandre%20Trudeau"&gt;Alexandre Trudeau&lt;/a&gt; is a journalist.

His father died on 28 September 2000 at the age of 80. During the &lt;a href="w%3Astate%20funeral"&gt;state funeral&lt;/a&gt;, Trudeau, then 28, delivered an emotional speech which led to speculation in the media that a career in politics could be his future. He has also openly stated that he opposes Quebec nationalism. Trudeau put his support behind Liberal leadership candidate &lt;a href="w%3AGerard%20Kennedy"&gt;Gerard Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada%20leadership%20convention%2C%202006"&gt;2006 Liberal Party of Canada leadership convention&lt;/a&gt;. Kennedy dropped out of the second ballot of voting and both he and Trudeau went on to support now leader &lt;a href="w%3ASt%C3%A9phane%20Dion"&gt;Stéphane Dion&lt;/a&gt;.

Pitcher &lt;a href="w%3AJosh%20Hancock"&gt;Josh Hancock&lt;/a&gt; passed away early Sunday after crashing his car into a tow truck. The accident occurred on &lt;a href="w%3AInterstate%2064"&gt;Interstate 64&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Louis"&gt;St. Louis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Missouri"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt; at about 12:30am, and was pronounced dead at the scene. He was 29 years old.

Josh Hancock was drafted by the &lt;a href="w%3ABoston%20Red%20Sox"&gt;Boston Red Sox&lt;/a&gt; in 1998 and made his &lt;a href="w%3AMajor%20League"&gt;Major League&lt;/a&gt; debut in 2002. He was later traded to the &lt;a href="w%3APhiladelphia%20Phillies"&gt;Philadelphia Phillies&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ACincinnati%20Reds"&gt;Cincinnati Reds&lt;/a&gt; before being signed by the &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Louis%20Cardinals"&gt;St. Louis Cardinals&lt;/a&gt; in 2006. He was part of the 2006 World Series Cardinals team, and a current member of the Cardinals roster. He had just played in Saturday afternoon's game against the &lt;a href="w%3AChicago%20Cubs"&gt;Chicago Cubs&lt;/a&gt;, pitching three solid innings.

Hancock was mourned around the league. The Cleveland Indians held a moment of silence before their game, displaying Hancock's picture on the scoreboard. Bud Selig, Commissioner of Major League Baseball, said "All of baseball today mourns the tragic and untimely death of St. Louis pitcher Josh Hancock. He was a fine young pitcher who played an important role on last year's World Series championship team."

This is the second time in recent years that a Cardinals pitcher has died during the regular season. In 2002, &lt;a href="w%3ADarryl%20Kile"&gt;Darryl Kile&lt;/a&gt; was found dead in his room at the team's hotel during a series against the Cubs in &lt;a href="w%3AChicago%2C%20Illinois"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Illinois"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt;. The final game of the Cardinals-Cubs series, scheduled for 7:00pm tonight, has been postponed because of the tragedy.

A gunman killed three people and wounded two others Sunday after a shooting occurred at the &lt;a href="w%3AWard%20Parkway"&gt;Ward Parkway&lt;/a&gt; shopping center in &lt;a href="w%3AKansas%20City%2C%20Missouri"&gt;Kansas City, Missouri&lt;/a&gt;. The shooting took place at around 4 p.m. local time (2200 UTC). The gunman fired shots from the parking lot, then entered the mall and continued shooting. He himself was then shot, presumably by local police.

&lt;a href="w%3AStatoil"&gt;Statoil ASA&lt;/a&gt; (Statoil), a &lt;a href="Norway"&gt;Norwegian&lt;/a&gt; state-owned oil company, entered into an agreement Friday to purchase all outstanding common shares of the privately held Canadian firm, North American Oil Sands Corporation (NAOSC). The deal is reported to be worth CAD2.2 billion in an all-cash transaction.

NAOSC is an Alberta-based oil company founded in 2001. It manages 1,110 square kilometres of &lt;a href="w%3ATar%20sands"&gt;oil sands&lt;/a&gt; leases located in northern &lt;a href="Alberta"&gt;Alberta&lt;/a&gt;. It is estimated that the NOASC oil sands hold approximately 2.2 billion barrels of oil reserves. The company is planning to develop an extraction project and an upgrading facility. When the project is completed, NAOSC expects it to produce over 200,000 barrels of &lt;a href="w%3ABitumen"&gt;bitumen&lt;/a&gt; per day. The upgrading facility would then process the bitumen into synthetic crude oil.

The NAOSC board of directors has approved the bid from Statoil unanimously, and has recommended that its shareholders accept the offer. One of the largest shareholders of NAOSC currently is Paramount Resources Ltd. (TSX:POU). Paramount announced Friday that it had entered into a lock-up agreement with Statoil, which calls for Paramount to sell its 30.9% interest in NAOSC to Statoil ASA for a cash deal worth approximately $682 million.

"We are impressed by the performance and competence held by the employees in NAOSC,” said Helge Lund, chief executive of Statoil. “Combined with Statoil’s experience and commitment to prudent operations, we are well-positioned to develop the resources in a sustainable manner, creating value for Statoil and its shareholders."

Statoil suggests that the development plans for the NAOSC oil sands includes an application of &lt;a href="w%3ASteam%20assisted%20gravity%20drainage"&gt;Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage&lt;/a&gt; (SAGD) technology, which, according to the company, leaves a smaller environmental footprint than strip mining. Statoil admits, however, that heavy oil production, such as is required in the oil sands, is "energy intensive and challenging in an environmental perspective." The company said it intends to &lt;a href="w%3ACarbon%20capture%20and%20storage"&gt;capture the carbon dioxide&lt;/a&gt; (CO2) emissions from its oil sands production and store it underground.

Under new environmental regulations announced Thursday by Canadian Environment Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Baird%20%28Canadian%20politician%29"&gt;John Baird&lt;/a&gt;, companies that can't meet new intensity targets for CO2 emission reductions will be able to purchase offset credits or contribute to a technology fund, at an initial cost of $15 per tonne of emissions. New plants would have three years before they were obligated to begin reducing their emissions.

However, Julia Langer, director of the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Wide%20Fund%20for%20Nature"&gt;World Wildlife Fund's&lt;/a&gt; global threats program, told the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Globe%20and%20Mail"&gt;Globe and Mail&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that the initial exemptions for new plants and the technology fund contributions would undermine the government's new environmental plan. "This is a regulatory plan that is geared to business as usual for the tar sands sector," said Langer.

The Statoil-NAOSC transaction is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2007.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=No%20un-Islamic%20hairdo%2C%20makeup%2C%20or%20ties%20for%20Iranian%20men&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

New reports have emerged detailing the extent of the efforts by the &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;ian government to purge Western cultural influence in Iran that is deemed un-Islamic. Based on Iran's Islamic &lt;a href="w%3ASharia"&gt;Sharia&lt;/a&gt; law, non-compliance results in legal punishment because the state sees itself responsible in executing punishment for Islamic theological sins.

Newspaper headlines such as "Western hairstyles ... have been banned" re-iterated the legal status of Western hairstyles; barbers who offer to what officials consider un-Islamic hairdos, provide make-up services, and pluck eyebrows have been warned that they can face month-long suspension or revocation of their licenses. Barber clients who violate government policies will be subject to lashes, fines and imprisonment. Iranian male youth are not supposed to sport outlandish hairstyles or use gel to make their hair stand.

Additionally, the ban on neckties remains in place. This ban evades the attention of those outside Iran albeit attentive observers realize that, for example, not one of non-clerical members of the Iranian government wears a necktie. &lt;a href="w%3AMorality%20police"&gt;Vice squad police&lt;/a&gt; are in place to bring non-compliant individuals to &lt;a href="w%3AJustice%20in%20the%20Qur%27an"&gt;Islamic justice&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="Mahmoud%20Ahmadinejad"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt; has called for moderation and consideration for Iran's image worldwide emphasizing the need for a "cultural rather than disciplinary approach." Hard-line &lt;a href="w%3AUlema"&gt;clerics&lt;/a&gt; stress that both approaches are needed. Many Iranian women have appeared on state television whereon they praised Islamic dress code effusively and advocated the arrest of offenders. 

The Supreme Cultural Revolution Council, created during the &lt;a href="w%3AIslamic%20Cultural%20Revolution"&gt;Islamic Cultural Revolution&lt;/a&gt;, indicated that it would filter immoral video and audio messages sent using cellular phones. According to Iranian television statement, "In order to prevent possible misuse of &lt;a href="w%3AMultimedia%20Messaging%20Service"&gt;MMS&lt;/a&gt;, immoral actions and social problems, the Telecommunications Ministry will filter immoral MMS." No details of how immoral messages would be filtered such naming the type of software to be used were divulged. 

Grand Ayatollah &lt;a href="Ali%20Khamenei"&gt;Ali Khamenei&lt;/a&gt; explicitly delineated the threats Iran faces on the cultural front,

Following the Islamic Revolution, the Revolutionary Guards is reported to have cut women’s lips with razors because the women were wearing lipstick. This was done in public view to deter others.

Former &lt;a href="w%3ADirector%20of%20the%20Central%20Intelligence%20Agency"&gt;Director of the Central Intelligence Agency&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Tenet"&gt;George Tenet&lt;/a&gt; has released his &lt;a href="w%3Amemoir"&gt;memoir&lt;/a&gt;, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAt%20the%20Center%20of%20the%20Storm%3A%20My%20Years%20at%20the%20CIA"&gt;At the Center of the Storm: My Years at the CIA&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

The book outlines Tenet's version of &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%2C%202001%20attacks"&gt;9/11&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AWar%20on%20Terrorism"&gt;War on Terrorism&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AWar%20in%20Afghanistan%20%282001%E2%80%93present%29"&gt;2001 War in Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, the run-up to the &lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20war"&gt;2003 Iraq war&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Arough%20interrogation"&gt;rough interrogation&lt;/a&gt; and other events.

Tenet spoke about his memoir on &lt;a href="w%3A60%20Minutes%20II"&gt;♡❤60 Minutes♡❤&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, outlining the contents of his book including allegations that are contrary to the &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush%20administration"&gt;George W. Bush administration&lt;/a&gt; positions.

Tenet faced accusations of hypocrisy from former &lt;a href="w%3Aespionage"&gt;espionage&lt;/a&gt; officials on the book's release date, for not speaking out earlier against the &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;'s push to invade &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;.

An error was found in the book where a key conversation with then &lt;a href="w%3APentagon"&gt;Pentagon&lt;/a&gt; advisor &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Perle"&gt;Richard Perle&lt;/a&gt; on September 12, 2001, in which Tenet claims Perle told him that "Iraq had to pay for the attack" could not have occurred as Perle was stranded in Paris and didn't return to &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; until three days later.

&lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;i cricket coach &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Woolmer"&gt;Bob Woolmer&lt;/a&gt;, who was found dead in his hotel room after the shock loss of the Pakistani cricket team to lowly-ranked Ireland during the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Cricket%20World%20Cup"&gt;Cricket World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, was poisoned before being strangled, according to a TV report due to be broadcast on the BBC News programme ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3APanorama%20%28TV%20series%29"&gt;Panorama&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

According to the programme, a toxicology report prepared after Woolmer's death indicates that he had a substance in his bloodstream which would have incapacitated him, leaving him helpless. This would explain how Woolmer, a large man over six feet tall, was strangled with little sign of a struggle.

Speculation has been rife in the cricketing community that Woolmer's death is connected to &lt;a href="w%3Amatch%20fixing"&gt;match fixing&lt;/a&gt;, a practice which rocked the sport in the late 1990s. &lt;a href="Jamaica"&gt;Jamaica&lt;/a&gt;n police, however, have consistently refused to comment as to whether they have any leads on the case.

&lt;a href="Microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; has finally released its long awaited "&lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20Silverlight"&gt;Silverlight&lt;/a&gt;" into &lt;a href="w%3ASoftware%20testing%23Test%20levels"&gt;Alpha Testing&lt;/a&gt; for the general public. "It's the biggest challenge for Microsoft right now," said Brent Thill, an analyst from &lt;a href="w%3ACitigroup"&gt;Citigroup&lt;/a&gt;. This is the most direct threat to date, that Microsoft has posed to &lt;a href="w%3AAdobe%20Systems"&gt;Adobe&lt;/a&gt; (makers of the popular &lt;a href="w%3AAdobe%20Flash%20Player"&gt;Flash&lt;/a&gt; platform).

The creators of Silverlight have been promising a single plug-in which will work across all browsers and operating systems and will offer a rich video and interactive media experience which can be embedded within Web sites.

Microsoft has also promised to make some of the Silverlight technologies open source. This has been a popular decision among the computing industry, and has been a step away from the usual protection of their products.

While at MIX07, Microsoft also discussed its new package called &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20Expression%20Studio"&gt;Expression&lt;/a&gt;, which is set to be released in June, and will be an alternative to &lt;a href="w%3AAdobe%20Creative%20Suite"&gt;Adobe Creative Suite 3&lt;/a&gt; (CS3).

The Georgetown branch of the &lt;a href="w%3ADistrict%20of%20Columbia%20library"&gt;District of Columbia library&lt;/a&gt; is currently on fire in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; capital of &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20DC"&gt;Washington, DC&lt;/a&gt;.

In addition to books, the Georgetown Public Library has a large collection of historic documents and paintings that are part of the Peabody Collection. Firefighters are attempting to salvage some of these items.

DC Fire and Emergency Services (EMS) dispatched units at approximately 12:30 p.m. on April 30, 2007 to a report of smoke in the building. The first arriving fire fighters reported heavy smoke and began an initial attack. Fire fighters were soon pulled out of the building because of fears that the building might collapse.

The fire has been upgraded to a 3rd alarm fire with numerous fire apparatus responding. The fire has been largely knocked down as of 1:45 p.m., though many units remain on the scene. 

Traffic on Wisconsin Avenue and other area streets is being detoured around the fire area.

The final round of the &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20European%20Law%20Students%27%20Association"&gt;ELSA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMoot%20Court"&gt;Moot Court&lt;/a&gt; Competition on &lt;a href="WTO"&gt;WTO&lt;/a&gt; Law is taking place in &lt;a href="Geneva"&gt;Geneva&lt;/a&gt; this week. Eighteen teams from &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="North%20America"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALatin%20America"&gt;Latin America&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAsia-Pacific"&gt;Asia-Pacific&lt;/a&gt; have made it to the finals to contest one of the key issues underpinning WTO trade negotiations – commitment to public health. 

The &lt;a href="w%3ADoha%20Declaration"&gt;2001 WTO Doha Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health&lt;/a&gt; was a vital step in increasing access to medicines in health emergencies. It permits governments to temporarily set aside patents on specific medicines to protect the health of their people.

Many of the key arguments of the WTO negotiations on this matter as well as the issues surrounding free trade agreements (FTAs) between WTO members will be used by the students as they debate the issues at hand. Students will play out a dispute between two WTO members – one setting aside a pharmaceutical patent, the other challenging this on behalf of its industry – in front of a distinguished panel of judges, including many WTO luminaries.

Giorgio Sacerdoti, Chairman, WTO Appellate Body, said: "The WTO dispute settlement system fulfills at least two important systemic functions in today world society: (1) "ensure the respect of treaty based rights and obligations in a multilateral setting by providing the speedy resolution of disputes in an impartial way, based on the rule of law", (2) "by collective monitoring ensure implementation of those decisions". Lawyers are called to play an increasing role in this mechanism. ELSA has to be commended for preparing students to this challenge and opportunity on a worldwide basis."

&lt;a href="w%3ADell"&gt;Dell Inc.&lt;/a&gt; (Dell) announced Tuesday that, due to public demand, they will be offering an alternative to &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20Windows"&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt; on a selection of their desktop and laptop computers. Dell will partner with &lt;a href="w%3ACanonical%20Ltd."&gt;Canonical Ltd.&lt;/a&gt; to pre-install the recently released &lt;a href="w%3AUbuntu%20%28Linux%20distribution%29"&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt; 7.04 distribution of the Linux operating system.

Until recently, Linux distributions have not been adopted by mainstream computer makers due to concerns over ease-of-use. Newer distributions, such as Ubuntu 7.04, have become much more user-friendly, with features such as automatic updates and software installation.

Ubuntu director of business development Chris Kenyon told the &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;♡❤BBC♡❤&lt;/a&gt; that one of the reasons Ubuntu was selected was its support features and hardware compatibility. "Dell are going to work with us to make sure Ubuntu works fully on its hardware," said Kenyon. A Dell representative suggested that the Ubuntu distribution was chosen due to public demand as expressed on a Dell-run forum website, ♡❤IdeaStorm♡❤. "It was overwhelming, the response we got to the survey," said Jeremy Bolen, a Dell spokesman. 

Tuesday's announcement was not the first for Dell's Linux offerings. They have offered servers and workstations with an optional enterprise version of &lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Hat%20Enterprise%20Linux"&gt;Red Hat Linux&lt;/a&gt; for some time now. The chairman and CEO of Dell, &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Dell"&gt;Michael Dell&lt;/a&gt;, is reported to have Ubuntu installed on his own laptop. 

Perry Donham, an analyst with Aberdeen Group of Boston, suggested that the Dell-Ubuntu partnership will benefit Ubuntu more than it will Dell. "It's going to be a small part of [Dell's] market," said Donham. "But it's a great win for Ubuntu and for Linux in general."

Dell indicated that the Ubuntu-based computers would be available in the next few weeks, from Dell USA only for the time being. The pricing structure has not been revealed, or when such computers would be available in countries other than the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>Taliban resurgent in Pakistan on enforcement of Sharia law/Interview archive</h1>
♡❤♡What is the current situation in the NWFP?♡❤♡

The Pashtun people are or were renowned for their hospitality. Many westerners commented on it. Some with suspicion NOT willing to believe some people so poor could be so generous. It was almost a character flaw. One could travel with out fear of personal danger as long as you followed local protocols. (I would urge you to read Kiplings "East is East &amp; West is West." one more time, know this time that it is written about the Pashtun people.) 

That was the sort of mind set among the people. An ageless paradigm of self satisfaction: This is enshrined in the code of the Pashtuns way of life (see James Spain "The Way of the Pathans") - called Pashtunwali- in Pashto hospitality is referred to as "maelmastiya".

The Islamic radicalism is in reality nothing but the Taliban movement. As I said earlier not all Pashtuns are Taliban (obviously) but most Taliban are Pashtun. Of these most belong to the &lt;a href="w%3AFederally%20Administered%20Tribal%20Areas"&gt;FATA&lt;/a&gt;. Of these, most were affected by their cousins from Afghanistan coming over. Mingled with them were Arab-Afghans. Uzbeks and some Tajiks and even Chechens. Some of these married within the tribes and formed a bond with the locals. Marriage bonds go back in history. Again remember the mindset of the people here. Always keep that in mind. To them the scripture in the written word of God, and that includes the Old Testament (called Torat (Torah) and (Injeel = Bible less St. Pauls contributions). 

This Talibanization shows itself in the content of the Friday sermons at the mosque. Now it shows in the popularity of growing beards, especially since the &lt;a href="w%3AMuttahida%20Majlis-e-Amal"&gt;MMA&lt;/a&gt; - the coalition of religious political party's - won power. More recently in their showdown with the Pakistan army in N and S Waziristan - where according to my sources, people prefer going to the Taliban for justice rather than the older system of Maliks and Political Agents. The latter are known as corrupt. In Pakistan in general people are sick of the amount of corruption. 

And now in &lt;a href="w%3ABannu"&gt;Bannu&lt;/a&gt;, from where hails the Chief Minister of the NWFP, Mr Durrani, is in Taliban control in the sense that there is a parallel government that they have established and which is functioning quite well and is popular among the people.

♡❤♡Justice in tribal areas of Pakistan has been handled by elders, following a mixture of tribal tradition and Islamic law. Would you say that Taliban influence has caused a stricter intrepretation of Islamic law in the NWFP?

Yes. The Maliks, or tribal elders who consider themselves quite conservatively religious, even so had a laid back attitude towards enforcement of religious doctrine. That is where the difference comes. My opinion is that this is the reason that the Maliks supported the government of Pakistan in South Waziristan, which has recently been in the news having kicked out the militant Uzbek who came as guests in the post-soviet era and started mischief of their own but am not sure what their agenda was to begin with, and I myself have questions about their presence as to why they were not reported earlier, since reporting the presence of any foreigner(s) in the FATA is job one of the Pakistani Political Agents (PA). Why is the presence of the Uzbeks and the Chechen in the area just coming to light? Remember there are seven of these PA's - one for each FATA. The Taliban emulated the Saudi system of having a department concerned with citizens’ morals, even the name is the same, the department for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, and this department has – as in Saudi Arabia, an enforcement police, called mutawwa'in, a morals law-enforcement agency. 

♡❤♡Has there been a shift from tribal elders to clerics, as the main interpreters of law?♡❤♡

Yes there has been a movement in that direction but it has started a power struggle between the clerics who traditionally have been at the lowest strata of the social structure, to now when they have seen a bigger role for themselves first from the Taliban in Afghanistan – but also the government of the MMA in the NWFP who are nothing more than glorified clerics themselves, only a little smarter in exploiting religion politically, and the MMA is largely non-Pashtun which is a source of discontent in that they stand in the way of Pashtun nationalism, such as it is, because it only rears its head when non-Pashtuns start to usurp power over what the Pashtun consider their turf.

♡❤♡The deal made between Pakistani central government and the North and South Waziristan provinces, where tribal leadership was given the pivotal role in dealing with militants and the Taliban, has been criticized as a failure. What caused an initiative by tribal authority to fail?♡❤♡ 

First off, I don't agree with the premise of the question, that the "deal" is a "failure" - for the following reasons: 

<ol>
BULLET::::1. In the first place the Pakistan army (govt - same difference) did not have many options. This was the least worst option they had.
BULLET::::2. And most importantly, I have said this before, this area is literally in a time warp - which means they proceed at (what seems to us in the west) a glacial pace. I will give an example from the folklore:&lt;blockquote&gt;♡❤The story goes that a Pashtun had to repay (badal) an enemy for a crime against his family and he waited patiently for 20 years (some say 50 years), after this time, he exacted his revenge - but soon after was depressed because he wondered "Did I act too hastily?"♡❤&lt;/Blockquote&gt;So one part of Pashtunwali is to "pay back" - (Badal: literally to exchange) which most people translate as revenge. Yes that is the form that is most visible, but badal is also played out in the exchange of gifts at wedding and other celebrations, and in the exchange of favors like in politics. The rules can be arcane, unwritten and hard to follow -- who did what to whom, when, and so on, and what is the proper recompense -- this same give and take would occur in a peace process pursued by the Tribal Maliks, who rule by consensus (see Olaf Caroe) and there is no actual leader in the western sense, because all the Maliks, in fact all the others are de facto, so many co-equals (The Way of the Pathans/ People of the Khyber - James Spain pp 129 on.) - it is a mind set, a paradigm foreign to the uninitiated, as is the concept of consensual gay sex to the Wazir in Waziristan.
BULLET::::3. I wish someone would read the history of this area, it would help in dealing with our expectations and possibly much more. For instance there are two major tribe in N and S Waziristan, the Wazir, and the Mahsud - in the news you hear about the sub tribes; The most famour character of North Waziristan, the equivalent of a Jesse James, was leader called the "Faqir of Ippi" - he died in 1960, the Pakistan govt never was able to capture him, even though he set up a govt of Independent Pashtunistan in cahoots with Kabul. The great uprising of India of 1897 had its roots in Waziristan, as did the Treaty of Razmak. Of all the Pashtun, the Wazir are the most independent minded and the least to be cowed by military action.
BULLET::::4. So what options did Pakistan have, more military action? It had already lost hundred of their "privates" in action. Allow the US forces to come in, as a matter of fact the ISAF do cross into the Pakistani territory, we just don't know how deep they go -- the rules of engagement, as I understand them are, that if they (the US Army of Marines) are in "hot pursuit" then they cross into Pakistan. In reality they do it more often then that, just that there is no proof of it, who will report it, the Wazir? Or the Pakistan army?
BULLET::::5. The last part of your question, there are many assumptions, all wrong. The initiative was not from the tribals. There is no single authority amongst the tribal, they would convene a Jirga and decide on a course of action, such as this, to my knowledge no such jirga was called. To save face the Pakistan government might claim it was a tribal initiative, but it seems highly unlikely. The Pak troop's casualties were so high, and there was talk of hostages being held as well -- I tend to believe, that the Governor of the NWFP initiated the talks and the agreement, because he sure as hell is taking all the heat for its "failure".
BULLET::::6. That brings me to the last issue, the agreement has not failed, because it has not been given enough time, in Wazir time reference, not American time presidential election cycle controlled. I do not have a crystal ball, but if I did, I would see NATO troops in Afghanistan long after Iraq is over. Afghanistan can be a success ONLY if we accept one thing, the time warp these people live in -- by my reckoning its still 1700 CE over there.

♡❤♡If the Talibanization of Pakistan is partly due to a perception of corruption among the older system of Maliks and Political Agents, and Musharraf has critics lining up, who can the U.S. turn to in dispensing with $10 billion in aid monies?♡❤♡ 

Talibanization has nothing to do with your premise there. Zilch. Nada. The corruption is in the &lt;a href="w%3AInter-Services%20Intelligence"&gt;ISI&lt;/a&gt;, the Pak army and the Pak system of Political Agents (PA) assigned to these tribal zones (&lt;a href="w%3AFederally%20Administered%20Tribal%20Areas"&gt;FATA&lt;/a&gt; &amp; PATA). These PA have budgets that are much like the &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Intelligence%20Agency"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; in that they are a single line item in the national budget, there is no accountability of where or how the PA spends the money. If one followed the IRS rules and looked at the lifestyles of the PA and compared them with their income, you would soon understand what was going on. Musharraf critics are a larger issue. For eons, Republicans have coddled Pakistan with the belief that "as long as they are pro America" - democracy in Pakistan will come in due course. Democrats have, I think, insisted Democracy first, and then we can discuss the other issues later. For example, pre 9/11, compare how Carter's administration treated Gen Zia and how Reagan's administration treated him. 

The Talibanization of Pakistan has more to do with graduates of "&lt;a href="w%3ARaiwind"&gt;Raiwind&lt;/a&gt;" a place near Lahore where the "Tablighi Jamaat" conducts brainwashing camps. It was graduates of this place, in my opinion, that are responsible for Britain's &lt;a href="w%3A7%20July%202005%20London%20bombings"&gt;7/7 attacks&lt;/a&gt; as an example. For the Talibanization of the FATA, see &lt;a href="w%3AAhmed%20Rashid"&gt;Ahmed Rashid's&lt;/a&gt; classic study on the subject wrt to Afghanistan but applicable to Pashtuns in the NWFP equally, in a sense.

Corruption amongst the Maliks is self limiting because of the egalitarian society they live &amp; because of Pashtunwali (see Charles Lindholm, Oxford press). 

Who can the US turn to? This is a tough one. The Pakistani national psyche has not progressed the way the Indians have. There are still very much remnants of the Raj visible and present and invisible but Pakistani behavior gives it away - in the way they treat household help, in the way company bosses treat their employees, in the way the government officers often act above the law. For example the NWFP is supposed to be dry - yet the governemt employees consume copious amounts of liquor. There are some that even moonshine at home. (I have pictures I could share taken at "dance" party, more like a stag party.)

I think this last question is best answered in who has been reliable in the past, and assume the past to be an indicator of future behavior.

We know the Pak army will siphon large amounts towards its Nuclear program and the upkeep of its generals.

We know that Nawaz Sharif left the national treasury almost bankrupt when Musharraf took over.

We know that Benazir husband took 10% of all government deals. I believe he has an Interpol warrant for his arrest, although I can't vouch for it, it does come out in the news, even though it's puzzling why Interpol has trouble executing the warrant. Now I hear they are withdrawn. 

So who does that leave? 

The next generation of Politicians who are not beholden to anyone. 

In my opinion, the US should insist on the scheduled elections but accede to some genuine Pakistani concerns: 

Nawaz Sharif and Benazir Bhutto ought to be ineligible to run, BUT other members of the respective party PML (N) and PPP (B) can do so.

Prohibit allocation of emblems to the religious party which they can &amp; have misused. 

For example in the last election they asked for and got the symbol of a book, they then went on to advertise the symbol represented the Qur'an and a vote for the book was a vote for the Qur'an - not the candidate but the Qur'an. Well the ploy worked only too well. Imagine a similar vote here where a vote is asked for as a vote for the Bible! You can imagine the results. 

♡❤♡What is your take on the Musharraf suspending the judge &lt;a href="Protests%20in%20Pakistan%20as%20Chief%20Justice%20appears%20before%20judges%27%20panel"&gt;Iftikhar Chaudhry&lt;/a&gt;?♡❤♡ 

My take:

I believe, and this is widely held belief, that Musharraf has no constituency of his own for his power base. He wanted legitimization from the Supreme Court, and from Mr Choudhry as Chief Justice (their system is not like ours) would not give it. 

So Musharraf has had to hang on to his Army Chief of Staff position to get his power from the Army. If some one else were Chief of Staff, that person could refuse to support Musharraf.

The Justice favorable to the general is Justice Iqbal, who was not the next in line for Chief Justice. The next in line is a Hindu. That presented problems of its own for Musharraf. So when the Hindu judge went for a trip to India, Iqbal became the "available" senior most Supreme Court judge, and hence the haste and lack of decorum with which Justice Chaudhry was removed.

Now we have to wait for the other shoe to fall --- will Iqbal issue a Judicial ruling which would make it easy for Musharraf to stay on as Chief of Staff - in the meantime, the US has asked him to relinquish this army position.

Needless to say, it was very badly handled, high handed, and the TV was present -- the country saw what was being done to the highest member of the court of law, and in their mind, as in mine, the law in Pakistan was being manhandled, handcuffed and sent off packing to jail, so to speak. Something we long suspected, but was confirmed on TV and in the Newspapers. Overseas organizations taking up Chaudhry's cause, might lead one to belive that Musharraf's days are numbered, and they would be wrong, because America needs Musharraf - for the time being, anyway - because Iraq has scared America, just as in the post Vietnam era, there is now a fear regarding Muslim countries - the fear of the alternative, will democracy in Muslim country give us more of Ahmedinejad or Al-Maliki, or can we find some Hamid Karzais'? We just don't know.

♡❤♡Can you tell us what the prevailing sentiment in the region regarding the Pakistani government effort in the provinces and the international effort in Afghanistan to combat Taliban and affiliated militants?♡❤♡ 

In my dealings and inquires, ♡❤one♡❤ thing stood out like a sore thumb - the conspiracy theories vis-à-vis anything having to do with America. I mentioned to one of my close friends that events that were previously ascribed as acts of God were now considered acts of the &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Intelligence%20Agency"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt;. Some even believed that the Earthquake in the northern areas was because of some sort of underground secret "bomb" used by the CIA. Lack of evidence is further proof that the CIA did it. I was flabbergasted, and started to give this kind of thinking as an example in speaking to "educated" Pakistani's - and among these, those that did agree that the earthquake was NOT the work of the CIA, they would start giving other examples, notably the Blow up of the plane carrying Zia ul Haq an ex President of Pakistan, in which the US Ambassador also perished. When I would point this out, the response would be that that is the sort of thing they do to take away suspicion from themselves.

In a nutshell, the impression I came away with is, there is NO war of civilizations going on, what is going on is a war between literacy and illiteracy. I use the latter term in the widest connotation.

Pakistan government efforts: While on the one hand people would decry that the government is not doing enough, in the same breath they would state the government is a puppet of the US and only does what the US tells it to do. In this sense there is very little awareness among the people about what the Pakistani army is doing in the FATA or for that matter in &lt;a href="w%3ABalochistan%20%28Pakistan%29"&gt;Balochistan&lt;/a&gt;. The local newspapers are censored, and if not censored they do not allocate much space to the topics. "Dawn," which is the highest circulation English language paper, carries more stories about the US than about the local stories, that might appear say in "Newsweek." 

The international effort in Afghanistan is not considered international at all, only American. You could speak till you are blue in the face, and you would not change anyone's mind. In my case they would simply turn quiet, not wishing to offend a "guest" (see Pashtunwali). 

It is commonly agreed that some thing has to be done to curb the religious extremism that has taken root here, while historically these people (Pashtun) are a moderate people (see Olaf Caroe "The Pathans"). In fact some of the reasons the extremism has crept in is that many of the cultural practices were not in accordance with Saudi based "Salafiism" more popularly known as Wahabism. But Mr Wahab dates to the period of Lawrence of Arabia - Salafism dates further back, and is one of the six or seven schools of "Fiqh" or jurisprudence, but the latter fiqh has morphed into a cult like sect. 

Taliban are not visible in the areas I visited, but the militants handiwork clearly is - as elsewhere, the common criminals are taking advantage of this situation, and crime is up significantly. One new crime is Cell phone "snatching" - it's easy and nobody wants to pursue it. If some one is using a Razr phone, he can expect to be hit soon, if he uses it in public. So people have two cell phone (Called mobiles here) one fancy to show off, one for use in public places. 

In so far as "foreign" militants are captured and identified, that is to say non-Pashtun (including non Afghan Pashtun or Pak Pashtun) - then the people are obviously in agreement with the government that these people don't belong here and need to go. 

The problem is this: 

The foreigners are usually in the FATA and have been there since the Soviet war times. Many of them have taken local wives and now have a family. The local have accepted them into their family. Now for the Pak govt to ask them to kick them out, the locals are thinking what am I doing to my grandchildren's father, etc. Again the edicts of Pashtunwali also play a role.

♡❤♡What kind of support is there in the area for the positions advocated by the Taliban on matters such as Sharia law, women's education, role in public affairs, its proscriptions on entertainment such as movies, music ..etc?♡❤♡ 

In the areas that I visited and the people that I spoke to, which by definition is a very non-random sample, the people are TOTALLY opposed to the Taliban. I do have one nephew who seems to have come under the influence of the Salafi's but that is a different story. I can address that separately and you can decide if it belongs with this story - not my nephew's story but the way the Salafi's have woven themselves into this area --- which is historically a "Hanafi" fiqh area, which is much more moderate. Like I said this may be tangential to the main story. 

In general, people will say Yes we are Muslim and we are for the Sharia, but in general most people do not know what that entails. 

In their mind it entails a more just system, a less corrupt government. 

But if you ask them if they want a system like the Taliban the answer is an unequivocal NO. 

Women's education is quite the norm in the non FATA parts of the NWFP. When I visited the earthquake area which is also mostly in the NWFP, (I have photo's and video) the girl schools were some of the first to spring up. I remember being pleasantly surprised by this at the time. 

As far as a role in Public, it gets complicated. Women are in general expected to be docile and compliant, and the same expectation foloows through into Public affairs. But this point of view is not limited to the NWFP - it is the same all over Pakistan, excluding the large cities of Lahore, Karachi, Islamabad etc. yet still applicable to Peshawar. 

In Peshawar you do get to see more girls getting jobs as tellers in a bank and some other non traditional jobs, whereas previously the only jobs were either teachers to young kids, teachers to older girls, nurses and doctors - for the most part. 

Movies in the NWFP in the Theaters are for the lower socio economic men only. The reason is other than Talibanization. The easy availability of pirated, good quality DVD's of Indian and Hollywood movies (From China thru the land route over the Karakorum Highway) - it cost Rs120 ($2/-) for the whole family to watch a movie in the comfort of their home. Travelling to a theater might cost that much in gas. The inconvience. The crowds. The men gawking at the women and last but definitely not least, some bombs exploding in the theater some years back, put a comllete stop to the middle class from going out to see movies. 

Paashtuns love music. So even though I hear that some bus drivers have been fined for playing their cassettes, I doubt this is going to stop them from playing their music. Some thing far worse has to happen - I think the drivers may start carrying guns and having it out with who ever is tring to stop them from their favorite music. 

What is not being reported and what the Taliban could do effectively is to cut up cable tv cables. Most cable companies string their cable ABOVE ground to save cost and take it along the electric poles, below the electricity wires. Since these are exposed there have been many (several) instances of the cables being cut up. Luckiliy there is no market for coaxial cable, or more cable would be lost to druggies doing the cutting. The latter is a serious problem that you don't hear about. One person that I knew told me that he was building his house and had poured conrete and reinforcements for the pillars. The next day he found the reinforcement bars to have been cut up flush with the ground slab leaving him to figure out how to do the rebar of the rest of the pillar.

♡❤♡To what degree does this support stem from fear and intimidation?♡❤♡ 

The Taliban are Pashtun, and the populace is Pashtun. The Pashtun do not scare easy. They are not intimidated easily. They might comply for the moment and then come back with a vengeance, so to speak. The women folk are more susceptible to intimidation, as was evidenced by the closure of the schools, because the mothers decided that they were not going to take a chance that their kids might get injured.

♡❤♡How about the "political positions" of the insurgent movement - resistance to foreign troops, and the &lt;a href="w%3AHamid%20Karzai"&gt;Karzai&lt;/a&gt; government? Is there a separatist or nationalist component to the movement?♡❤♡ 

Karzai is not popular among the Pashtun's who are loyal to Pakistan in the NWFP, those are the one I met mostly. They think that Karzai is opportunistic in that he is fleecing the government of the US whereas he himself is little more than the mayor of Kabul. They point to his American bodyguards as proof that he is disliked by his own people, that the moment the American leave Karzai is a dead man. 

I can not speak to the separatist movement. I have seen no evidence of it. There is widespread resentment that the Federal government refuses to give a name to the province, a name of the people's liking - there have been recently articles in Dawn about this, I will try and find them for you.

Nationalism is alive and well on the other hand, all over Pakistan - in all its four provinces. Everybody hates the Punjabi's - almost to the man. 

It is my opinion that were it not for US aid, Pakistan will go the route of Yugoslavia. With lots of bloodshed. 

Resistance to foreign troops is like the national pastime among the Pashtun. Even today they collect in the evenings and will tell tales, vastly glorified of the way their grandfather fought against the British.

In other parts of the NWFP, like Charsadda and Mardan where Abdul Ghaffar Khan (the frontier Gandhi) was popular you have old "khudai khidmatgars" telling their stories of how they kicked out the British.

The only thing that Unites the Pashtun, are foreign troops on their soil. Other than that "Pashtun Unity" is almost an oxymoron.

♡❤♡What do you think the U.S., the international community and Pakistan should do to ease the problems in the region?♡❤♡

In my opinion, based on my conversations with individuals in positions to know these things, plus a little bit of plain common sense, plus knowing the history of the people and of the area: The ONE thing that will NOT work is direct military action. We know this from history. We know that the Pashtuns love to fight. We know that the Talibanization has brought the Jihadi's into the picture, who like nothing better than to be martyred. So we need to keep this in mind, of what NOT to do. Having said that, what I am going to say next may appear like a paradox. 

Because the Pashtun do not like to deal with what they believe are wus or weak people, we do need to have a strong PRESENCE there, and a strong "show of force" - invite a "Jirga" to like a demonstration of what the US air force is capable of doing - just to show them, - the reason is that their paradigm is the 14th century, if you simply told them that we can do this to you, they will simply think you are lying, because that is what they do, they lie to show off. 

But if you drop a daisy cutter and tell them before hand what it is capable of, or a stealth bomber, these technologies are outsides their mind-set; we have to get them to believe that we have these capabilities, like the Drone. Or spy satellites. 

From this position of strength, and always reminding them that we are raring to use our forces in that like them we also love to shoot our guns at every opportunity, but then not actually do it ( in this sense we had achieved all out objectives with Saddam prior to invading Iraq IMHO invading Iraq was redundant) - so the next step would be:

<ol>
BULLET::::1. Education
BULLET::::2. Development meaning providing a means of livelihood so they do not have to become military mercenaries to make a living.
BULLET::::3. Gradually replacing their madrassas with our own madrassas, except in the latter, the Mullah is an educated individual who knows comparative religion, and they teach other subjects including Biology, anthropology, measuring the age of the earth by carbon dating etc. and astronomy to learn the age of the Universe, black holes, quasars Relativity concepts, quantum mechanic concepts (not the mathematics, the simple concepts behind them, and how these ideas are behind some of today's everyday electronic devices)
BULLET::::4. Leisure activity, starting with traditional leisure activity, i.e. not TV and cable and Internet, but ultimately making these available
BULLET::::5. Introduce these "NEW" technologies through a religious mode. Transmit a Qur'anic recital competition to begin with, as an example instead of beginning with MTV.
BULLET::::6. Making water available. Drinking water is an everyday necessity, for cooking etc, and not available in most of the FATA.
BULLET::::7. Food grain. Wheat flour etc, keep the prices the same as in Peshawar - these people are not traders, they are easily exploited, and like porn they couldn't tell you what exploitation is, but they can tell you when they see it.

</ol>
♡❤♡What makes the North-West Frontier Province competent to administer any monies?♡❤♡

This is the central question. Much like California has taken a separate initiative on stem cell research – as an analogy – the NWFP is central to the war on terror, not Pakistan. 

The NWFP was central to the fight and aid to the Afghans during the Soviet occupation, not Pakistan. 

This small distinction is lost on Washington, and it is the main reason, in my opinion, why so much of the Aid was "lost in transit was because the Punjabi army officers could not bring themselves to dispense such large sums to an ethnic group which it considers anti-Pakistani (You would have to read the history of the Indian partition, in particular that the NWFP was a “Indian Congress Party” controlled province where as the "Muslim League" of Jinnah was trying to show the Brits that all the area was FOR the creation of Pakistan). 

All the FATA is contiguous to the NWFP. The Taliban and Al-Qaeda are holed up somewhere either in the FATA, or across the Durand Line in Afghanistan, the Durand Line has never been recognized by the locals as an international boundary. Even today, the Pashtun travel from Peshawar to Kabul by road with out a passport or visa, and it has been like that for eons.

The present governor of the NWFP belongs to the Orakzai tribe (he spells his name Aorakzai) and it is my opinion that that he was picked partly because he belongs to one of the FATA as well as he is a retired General of the Pak Army. 

The Frontier Constabulary (FC) is a force which primarily recruits from the FATA. All or most of its forces are from the various tribes. In the eyes of the tribes this is a bona fide force and service with the FC is considered an honorable thing. The US has already allocated some funds for increasing recruitment, but far less than what it would take to counter the Taliban and far less than what the economic need is. [The US] spends a thousand times more on a battalions sent to monitor activity over there. Plus why endanger the lives of our troops and spread our forces thin when a more effective job can be done by the FC. The FC has over history shown that they will attack and use force against the tribes that create trouble. There have been no instances of insubordination or mutiny.

Even the US Embassy is protected by a contingent of the FC! That goes to show their trustworthiness &amp; discipline. 

My second proposal is that there is a common phenomenon for Pashtun men to go to the Gulf States for jobs.

The "tribal" Pashtuns ( All Pashtuns are tribal, in that Pashtun form the largest tribal society in the world in terms of numbers) wrt the FATA are not educated or trained and hence not employable right now. I propose that we fund directly the Director of Emigrants (Mr Azhar Arbab) in Islamabad to set up training facilities in Concrete laying, iron work, pipe work, welding etc, which would then qualify these tribesmen to obtain jobs in the Gulf. As such we would remove them from the scene altogether. They would not be available in the labor pool to the Taliban or anyone else. I might add here, that a number of these individuals have very high innate intelligence, which is one reason they make formidable foes. 

Now the central reason why the NWFP ought to do this is because they are themselves most affected by the scourge of Talibanization. They are highly motivated in carrying out these policies because it is to their own benefit. 

One has to be convinced on this last point, and for that I urge you research the sentiments amongst the people of the province, such as I am willing to provide, and which you can corroborate from other sources as well. 

For instance, after Malik Saad was murdered, there were people, whom I heard myself, that expressed the feeling (admittedly stunned with grief) "If this is Islam then fuck such Islam" (I paraphrase, obviously, the Pashto is not directly translatable) – moreover, Mr Saad’s posters are competing with Osama’s in the Bazaar’s as a spontaneous gesture from the public. We can’t afford to let this good-will to be lost.

♡❤♡An ♡❤Associated Press♡❤ report on ♡❤MSNBC♡❤ dated March 15, 2007 and headlined "Arrest of al-Qaida’s 'best' reflects changing role" stated, ♡❤"A senior Western diplomat in Islamabad, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said the Taliban resurgence had not necessarily led to the re-emergence of al-Qaida training camps in Pakistan - a key U.S. ally in the war on terror - but had "created the environment for whatever is left of al-Qaida to feel more comfortable."♡❤ What does that mean?♡❤♡

A senior western diplomat usually means a Political Officer in the US Embassy, which most people know is a CIA agent, OR it could be some other Embassy official - 

First there is a big difference between Al Qaeda and the Taliban. 

Al Qaeda is mostly composed of Arabs, they do not trust any one else. While they might use others as couriers or in lowly position as servants, for second rate Al Qaeda officials, the Top guys ONLY deal with Arabs and are served by Arabs. 

The Taliban are mostly Pashtun tribesmen. Mostly they are graduates of madrassa's. 

Mostly illiterate by any world standards. The better educated among them will know how to speak a few words of English, such as their Information minister. There might be one or two notable exception of which I am not aware, I had heard Yale had admitted a Taliban, but never followed up on the story. 

However while Al Qaeda does not trust the Taliban, the Taliban look up to Al Qaeda top leadership. We saw this situation in Iraq where initially Al Zarqawi had no direct link with Qaeda but was keen to form one. It would be conjecture on my part to state that in the end he did indeed succeed in forming that connection. In the press at least that impression was prevalent.

So the lines of interest proceed ONE way, like one way traffic. Extremist want to be affiliated with Qaeda, IMHO, while the latter does not, again, in my opinion want to - so as to maintain its hideout. 

Now we come to the statement below: 

The Taliban resurgence is not connected directly to the Qaeda.
The Qaeda supply lines are hampered, new recruits would have to be Arabs, and they would have to travel a long way through tight Pakistani security to reach here, or suffer hardship over a long and arduous land route through Balochistan and the Tribal area's - NOT all of which are accommodating. 

So as is becoming clear, Qaeda is having trouble replacing people they loose meaning those that were captured or died. They only trust Arabs, and that also a certain type of Arabs, (not all Arabs are the same, not all Arabic is the same - for example they would never trust a Syrian, in fact Qaeda folks consider Syrian brand of Islam an apostasy - but that is another story). 

Okay so now we can understand the statement, that whatever remains of the Qaeda, are not in a position to set up training camps, since they are in a survival mode. The Taliban resurgence helps them get a little warm and fuzzy in this survival mode, since they feel a little bit more secure with their partners-in-arms doing some evil stuff, blowing up people and causing mayhem.

♡❤♡How many men does the FC field currently?♡❤♡

The FC currently has about 23000 men in total.

♡❤♡How much do they get paid?♡❤♡

They are paid the equivalent of $60 per month per person -Pak Rupees 3665, where Rs61= $1. 
They do have some fringe benefits but life is very spartan for these soldiers.

What the US could get in return is a huge bang for a buck, no pun intended. 

I think we ought to double the number of these soldiers with one proviso that the FC maintains its high standards of recruits.

Compare this with our costs in the War against Terror; just Halliburton’s bills will have you reeling. I think that it would be foolish, NOT to do this.

Again to reinforce the reasons:

The Frontier Constabulary is an Institution with a long and glorious history within the Frontier Province.

The recruits come strictly from the tribes of the various FATA and so they are very familiar with the people, the bad guys the terrain etc.

They speak the Pashto dialect of the locals. The Pashto language has many dialects, and you can tell where someone is from based on which dialect he speaks. So if you do not speak the correct dialect, you are immediately identified as an outsider. This is one reason why these tribes are impossible to penetrate, there are other reasons as well, that are beyond the scope of the current discussion.

♡❤♡How can the FC help prevent attacks like the suicide bombing attempt on &lt;a href="w%3AAftab%20Ahmad%20Khan%20Sherpao"&gt;Sherpao&lt;/a&gt; in Charsadda last weekend?♡❤♡

In essence your question is how can ♡❤anyone♡❤ prevent a suicide attack? 
And frankly if I knew the answer to that I think the US military - and several other groups - would be knocking on my door. I think the Israeli Army has had the most experience with this sort of thing. The suicide bombing as a tactical weapon was invented by the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka, and even today in terms of statistics they use it in far greater numbers.

So to summarize neither the FC nor anyone else can prevent a suicide bombing. We could attempt to improve our intelligence to find out about an imminent attack, but so far these have not been very successful in Pakistan. 
In the Lal Masjid Case the government avoided a suicide killing by negotiating with those two Mullah brothers - but I don't know if that counts. But it does make for an interesting story. Both Washington, DC and Islamabad now have Madams threatening to publish the list of their clients unless they are given protection. Who would have thunk?
Going back to your question:
In my opinion what ought to be done is to make a ♡❤♡Policy♡❤♡ change, and address the issues that are producing these suicide bombers, that is the only way to stop this phenomenon.
In this part of the world this is relatively new because prior to 9/11, suicide bombing was unheard of. Moreover it is not the FC's job to provide security to the Minister of the Interior, that is the job of the Police force, because this Ministry is equivalent to the Department of Homeland Security.
You don't expect Border patrol to provide body guard duty to the Secretary of the department of Homeland Security. 
I am making these analogies so the American readers would relate to what is happening, and understand the difference in nomenclature.-- 20:13, 3 May 2007 (UTC)

<h1>MLB: Yankees' Phil Hughes earns first win</h1>
♡❤♡May 2, 2007♡❤♡

20-year-old pitching phenom Phil Hughes cruised through hitters in just his second start for the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Yankees"&gt;New York Yankees&lt;/a&gt;, but the end result created even more frustration for the organization and fans everywhere.

Hughes retired 19 &lt;a href="w%3ATexas%20Rangers%20%28baseball%29"&gt;Texas Rangers&lt;/a&gt; without allowing a hit on Tuesday at the Rangers Ballpark in Arlington. Established big league stars such as Kenny Lofton, Mark Teixeira and Michael Young could not solve the youngster's blazing fastball or sharply biting curve. Hughes was on the verge of history. Even as his pitch count rose, the Yankees allowed him to keep firing. "He was fine," manager Joe Torre said of the 2004 first round draft pick. "We were going to allow him to go 100 pitches last time, so I didn't think that would be a problem." 

Just when the Yankees thought they found an answer to their early struggles, the organization was treated to an agonizing sight. After Teixeira fouled off an 0-2 pitch with one out in the sixth inning, Hughes grabbed his leg, having suffered a hamstring injury. His no-hit bid ended there (Texas would break up the no-hitter in the eighth inning off reliever Mike Myers), though he did earn his first big league win in a 10-1 Yankee romp over Texas. He walked off the mound under his own power, but will reportedly miss 4-6 weeks. 
Hughes voiced his frustration afterwards: "It's tough. It puts a damper on the whole thing." He added, "I'm at a point now where our rotation really needs it," referring to his presence on the New York pitching staff. Several Yankees have already voiced their excitement for the righthander's chances in the big leagues. For his part, Yankees star Jason Giambi compared him to Roger Clemens during Spring Training: "He looks like a young Rocket." 

The Yankees are currently just 10-14, thanks in large part to injuries that have befallen pitchers Chien-Ming Wang, Mike Mussina, Carl Pavano and Jeff Karstens. In a related story from today, the Yankees fired strength and conditioning coach Marty Miller. Reportedly, this was out of general manager Brian Cashman's concern for the alarming number of hamstring injuries so far this season.

<h1>Mercury astronaut Walter Schirra dies, aged 84</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Mercury%20astronaut%20Walter%20Schirra%20dies%2C%20aged%2084&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Schirra, who is best known for flying the &lt;a href="w%3AMercury-Atlas%208"&gt;Mercury-Atlas 8&lt;/a&gt; mission, launched on October 3, 1963, is believed to have died of natural causes on May 3, 2007.

"With the passing of Wally Schirra, we at NASA note with sorrow the loss of yet another of the pioneers of human spaceflight. As a Mercury astronaut, Wally was of a member of the first group of astronauts to be selected, often referred to as the Original Seven," said NASA Administrator Michael Griffin in a statement posted on NASA's website.

Schirra also flew on the mission, which was involved, along with &lt;a href="w%3AGemini%207"&gt;Gemini 7&lt;/a&gt;, in the first &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20rendezvous"&gt;rendezvous&lt;/a&gt; in orbit between two manned spacecraft. His third and final mission was the first manned &lt;a href="w%3AProject%20Apollo"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt; flight, &lt;a href="w%3AApollo%207"&gt;Apollo 7&lt;/a&gt;, during which he and two other astronauts tested the &lt;a href="w%3AApollo%20spacecraft"&gt;Apollo spacecraft&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3Alow%20Earth%20orbit"&gt;low Earth orbit&lt;/a&gt;, ahead of later &lt;a href="w%3AMoon"&gt;lunar&lt;/a&gt; flights.

He was the only astronaut to fly on &lt;a href="w%3AProject%20Mercury"&gt;Mercury&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AProject%20Gemini"&gt;Gemini&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AProject%20Apollo"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt; flights. Following his death, only two of the Mercury Seven, &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Glenn"&gt;John Glenn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AScott%20Carpenter"&gt;Scott Carpenter&lt;/a&gt; remain alive.
