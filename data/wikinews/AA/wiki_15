Striking &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; transit workers will return to their jobs in 12-24 hours under an agreement reached today. While no final contract agreement has been reached, transit work will resume as negotiations continue. At 2:40 pm EST, the &lt;a href="w%3ATransit%20Workers%20Union"&gt;TWU&lt;/a&gt; board voted to end the strike. By 3:00 pm, the TWU Local 100 website had posted a notice to workers to return to work.

Mediator Richard Curreri announced the union is "taking steps" to immediately restore transportation to the city. "We have requested the leadership of the TWU to take the actions necessary to direct its membership to immediately return to work and they have agreed to take such actions," Mr. Curreri told reporters.

Thirty-four thousand &lt;a href="w%3ATransport%20Workers%20Union"&gt;Transport Workers Union&lt;/a&gt; Local 100 members walked off the job December 20 after working months without a contract when negotiations broke down over disagreements concerning pensions, health benefits, and pay. Agreement had nearly been reached, but just a few hours before a strike deadline, the Metropolitan Transport Authority's chairman, Peter S. Kalikow, made an unexpected demand, requiring that all new transit workers increase the contribution to pensions from the present 2 percent of their wages to 6 percent, which upset the union members. Roger Toussaint, president of Transport Workers Union Local 100, stated "Were it not for the pension piece we would not be on strike." and summed up the whole conflict as "a fight over dignity and respect on the job, a concept that is very alien to the MTA. Transit workers are tired of being underappreciated and disrespected."

The strike has affected an estimated 7 million commuters in the city over three days, which is about 21 million person-days in total. New York's 34,000 bus and subway workers are affected by the difficulty of their everyday working conditions and health standards for a total of about 10 million person-days per year.

Two Australian men have been charged with entering a building with the intent of committing an indictable offence and malicious damage by fire, as a result of the &lt;a href="w%3A2005%20Sydney%20race%20riots"&gt;2005 Sydney race riots&lt;/a&gt;. Police have alleged that one of the men, a 17-year-old from &lt;a href="w%3AHurstville"&gt;Hurstville&lt;/a&gt;, climbed a telegraph pole in Brighton-le-Sands and took the flag from the RSL club. With the assistance of the second man, a 24-year-old from &lt;a href="w%3APenshurst"&gt;Penshurst&lt;/a&gt;, he set the flag alight. 

The man from Hurstville will appear in Bidura Children's Court, and the man from Penshurst will appear in Sutherland Local Court.

Private David Cosgrove, 22, the son of celebrated former defence chief General Peter Cosgrove will be discharged from the Army after going Absent Without Official Leave (&lt;a href="w%3AAWOL"&gt;AWOL&lt;/a&gt;) and breaching standing orders. 

David Cosgrove was placed in Holsworthy military prison in October, 2005 for up to 14 days after going AWOL from his Singleton barracks. When released he is alleged to have breached "unit standing orders" and was administratively warned he was "unsuitable for service". It is believed that he will leave the Army by March, 2006.

David Cosgrove's indiscretions have upset the military at the senior level. Senior army figures were furious with The Australian newspaper for reporting the incident.

It is also thought to be an embarrassment for General Cosgrove who led a much celebrated 40-year military career before retiring to become an executive at &lt;a href="w%3AQantas"&gt;Qantas&lt;/a&gt;.

It has also been learned that another of General Cosgrove's sons, Phillip, will be voluntarily leaving the Army following service in Iraq where he was injured.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales%20Police"&gt;New South Wales Police&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have begun their holiday Operation Safe Arrival holiday road safety campaign overnight. The campaign runs from 12:01AM December 23, 2005 until 11:59PM January 2, 2006.

In an attempt to keep the number of deaths on NSW roads at a minimum police will target speeding, seatbelt, helmet and drunk driving offences. According to the &lt;a href="New%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; Roads and Traffic Authority, 495 people have died on NSW roads between January 1 and December 11. This figure will surely climb over the holiday period.

The RTA has also begun double demerit points for speeding, seatbelt and helmet offences. The double demerit points will run for the same 11 day period as Operation Safe Arrival. The minimum penalty for any double demerit offence is 6 points. Provisional drivers need to be particularly mindful of these as P1 license holders (those who have had a license 12 months or less) can only incur 3 points. P2 license holders (those who have held a license for 12 to 36 months) have 6 and unrestricted license holders have 12.

According to the RTA, 23,624 drivers in the 2003/4 holiday season were issued with fines carrying double demerits and 2,150 motorists had their licenses suspended due to speeding or exceeding their demerit point limit.

The RTA introduced double demerits in 1997 in an attempt to force drivers to be more mindful of speeding, wearing seatbelts and motorcycle helmets. Double demerit points are now introduced over each major holiday period when a large proportion of road-related deaths occur.

Other jurisdictions in &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; which have double demerit points over holiday periods are &lt;a href="South%20Australia"&gt;South Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Western%20Australia"&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="Australian%20Capital%20Territory"&gt;Australian Capital Territory&lt;/a&gt;.

On Thursday the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Commission"&gt;European Commission&lt;/a&gt; threatened to fine &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; €2 Million per day if the corporation does not comply with a ruling made in March 2004, stating that Microsoft must provide interoperability with its protocols and other competing services. Microsoft has until January 25, 2006 to respond to the charges, and may also be fined for days after December 15, 2005 as well.

The European Commission says Microsoft has failed to comply with an order to supply competitors with "interoperability information" for the protocols implemented in &lt;a href="w%3AWindows"&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt; Server operating systems. These include those used to "deliver file
and print services and group and user administration services, including the Windows
Domain Controller services, &lt;a href="w%3AActive%20Directory"&gt;Active Directory&lt;/a&gt; services and Group Policy services" according to page 299 of the European Commission's decision. 

Microsoft argues that to do this breaches its intellectual property rights as it would be opening Windows Server up for cloning. It has previously appealed to the European Court of First Instance, a bid which failed and where Microsoft was given until December 15, 2005 to comply with the original decision. Microsoft has launched a second appeal attempt.

The decision in March 2004 also forced Microsoft to provide a version of &lt;a href="w%3AWindows%20XP"&gt;Windows XP&lt;/a&gt; without the eponymous &lt;a href="w%3AWindows%20Media%20Player"&gt;Windows Media Player&lt;/a&gt; and to pay fines of €497 million (US$586 million).

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Conservative Party of Canada&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; leader &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; today made bold claims about the &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AArctic"&gt;Arctic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; region at a campaign stop in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWinnipeg"&gt;Winnipeg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , "The single most important duty of the federal government is to protect and defend our national &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Asovereignty"&gt;sovereignty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ." . The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Canada"&gt;prime minister&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -hopeful stated, "There are new and disturbing reports of American &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Anuclear%20submarines"&gt;nuclear submarines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; passing though Canadian waters without obtaining the permission of &amp;mdash;or even notifying &amp;mdash; the Canadian government."

Harper promised a significant increase in military presence in the Canadian region, which has had notable soveriegnty disputes with the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADenmark"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANorway"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .
"You don't defend national sovereignty with flags," Harper said. "You need forces on the ground, ships in the sea, and proper surveillance."

Among other promises, Harper stated he would station three armed naval heavy ice breakers in the area of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIqaluit"&gt;Iqaluit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with 500 regular force personnel, recruit 500 more Canadian rangers, and build a new army training center in the area of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACambridge%20Bay"&gt;Cambridge Bay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANorthwest%20Passage"&gt;Northwest Passage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

"As prime minister, I will make it clear to foreign governments &amp;mdash; including the United States &amp;mdash; that naval vessels traveling in Canadian territorial waters will require the consent of the government of Canada," Harper stated.

The Conservative Party Website states this "“Canada First” Northern Strategy will increase surveillance, navy, army and air force presence".

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Liberal Party of Canada&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the Conservatives' most powerful rival in the election, quickly posted a rebuttal on their website. They claim Stephen Harpers stated defense budget of $5.3(&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20dollar"&gt;CAD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) billion over 5 years is not enough to afford the two polar icebreakers, which the Liberal party claims will cost $3(CAD) billion with the party estimating an upkeep of $150(CAD) million per year. "Where does Mr. Harper plan to find another $1 billion?" the party asked in their rebuttal.

The Arctic may be an important issue in the future for Canadians, as scientists expect the fabled Northwest Passage of the Arctic to open up for year round shipping by 2050 as a result of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aglobal%20warming"&gt;global warming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . According to the online encyclopedia &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , trade routes from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEurope"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFar%20East"&gt;Far East&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; could save 4000 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKilometre"&gt;km&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; through the passage, as compared to the current routes through the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APanama%20Canal"&gt;Panama Canal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Canada last flexed its muscle in the Arctic in 2004 in its most massive Arctic exercise ever, with six hundred personnel from the three services (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Forces%20Land%20Force%20Command"&gt;army&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Forces%20Air%20Command"&gt;air force&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Forces%20Maritime%20Command"&gt;navy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) involved in a large exercise in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABaffin%20Islands"&gt;Baffin Islands&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Canadians are scheduled to go to the polls on January 23, 2006 in an early election as a result of a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ano%20confidence"&gt;non-confidence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; motion in parliament against the former ruling Liberal party.

On &lt;a href="w%3ADebember%2022"&gt;December 22&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3A2005"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt; the special prosecutors of the Roman Magistrate's service announced that they were considering charging U.S. soldier &lt;a href="w%3AMario%20Lozano"&gt;Mario Lozano&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="w%3Amanslaughter"&gt;manslaughter&lt;/a&gt;. 

Lozano shot and killed &lt;a href="w%3AMajor%20General"&gt;Major General&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ANicola%20Calipari"&gt;Nicola Calipari&lt;/a&gt; during a disputed incident at BP 541, a blocking position for a mobile roadblock located behind a ninety-degree turn on the ramp that joined Route Vernon to &lt;a href="w%3ARoute%20Irish"&gt;Route Irish&lt;/a&gt; (the road between the heavily fortified &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Zone"&gt;Green Zone&lt;/a&gt; and the Baghdad International Airport). Some international observers claim that if Lozano is charged, relations between the &lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; government and the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; government will deteriorate, because the US government prefers to have immunity from criminal prosecution for its soldiers carrying out military actions around the world.

An Azerbaijan passenger plane has crashed after taking off from the country's capital, Baku, officials say. There was no immediate confirmation of casualties, but the plane is thought to have been carrying at least 18 people. The Azerbaijan Airlines (Azal) aircraft was heading to Aktau in Kazakhstan, according to Russian news sources.

The Ria news agency said the plane took off at 2119 (1819 GMT) but disappeared from radar screens 20 minutes later as it flew along the Caspian Sea coast. It is reported to have come down near the village of Kyurdakhany, about 15km (10 miles) from Baku, Ria said. An interior ministry official told the AFP news agency that the plane had crashed with 23 people on board. 

The Associated Press news agency described the plane as an An-140 twin engine turboprop. A police spokesman, who gave his name as Kadykov, told Reuters news agency: "The plane has crashed, 23 people on board are dead. An operations centre was set up near the Caspian coastline some 20km (13 miles) north of Baku, AP reported. A doctor at a hospital in Baku said that two bodies were recovered from the suspected crash site. Baku and Akmau are centres of the Caspian Sea oil industry.

The &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;National&lt;/a&gt; party &lt;a href="w%3ACoalition%20%28Australia%29"&gt;coalition&lt;/a&gt; has gained support in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; the latest Newspoll says.

Primary support for the coalition rose five points to 43 percent, while the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;ALP&lt;/a&gt;'s support fell four points to 34 percent. On a two-party preferred basis (where the minor parties are excluded from the polling) coalition support is at 52 percent.

The results are the lowest for the ALP in twelve months and the first time the coalition has polled ahead of the ALP since the departure of &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20carr"&gt;Bob Carr&lt;/a&gt; as premier. 

&lt;a href="w%3AMorris%20Iemma"&gt;Morris Iemma&lt;/a&gt; remains the more popular choice for premier with 40 percent support to &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Debnam"&gt;Peter Debnam&lt;/a&gt;'s 18.

The results indicate voter backlash over a series of errors made by the &lt;a href="w%3AMorris%20Iemma"&gt;Iemma&lt;/a&gt; government. These include anger over secret dealings with the &lt;a href="w%3ACross%20City%20Tunnel"&gt;Cross City Tunnel&lt;/a&gt;, plans for a desalination plant, a sharp decline in public services and budget blunders.

The next state election is due to be held in 2007.

<h1>Tolls may be needed for NSW Pacific Highway upgrade</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Tolls%20may%20be%20needed%20for%20NSW%20Pacific%20Highway%20upgrade&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

In a joint statement Friday by &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; federal Roads Minister Jim Lloyd and his &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; counterpart Joe Tripodi said that tolls were being considered to fast track upgrades of the &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Highway%20%28Australia%29"&gt;Pacific Highway&lt;/a&gt;. Over Half of the highway between the &lt;a href="w%3ASydney%20Newcastle%20Freeway"&gt;F3 freeway&lt;/a&gt; terminus at Beresfield on &lt;a href="w%3ANewcastle%2C%20Australia"&gt;Newcastle&lt;/a&gt; and the Queensland border is still single carriageway.

Despite the New England Highway being the "national" highway from the F3 to Brisbane, traffic along the Pacific Highway is almost three times heavier on most sections &lt;a href="http%3A//www.rta.nsw.gov.au/trafficinformation/downloads/aadt_data_files/aadtnorthern2004_i.pdf"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. By 2021, traffic on the Pacific Highway is expected to rise by 35 percent.

The New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority estimates that to complete the dual carriageway "North Coast Motorway" (Pacific Highway upgrade) by 2016 would cost $AU8 Billion. Since the major upgrades began in 1996, $AU2.2 Billion has been spent. Around 40 to 50 people die on the Pacific Highway every year.

Mr Lloyd said "If there are sections of the Pacific Highway where you can get private sector involvement, get it built quickly, provide value for money for those who wish to use it and alternative routes for those who choose not to, then I think let's go for it". The proposal could introduce tolls on some sections of the highway with other sections (that are completely publically funded) remaining toll free.
The plans have drawn mixed results from transport groups. A spokesperson for the NRMA, the largest motorist's organisation in NSW said that tolls should only be considered as a "last resort". He further added that if the only way the road could be upgraded was by use of tolls then the NRMA would agree with conditions. He said that any toll should not exceed $AU20.

Tourism and transport lobby group TTF Australia welcomed the move but warned that NSW north coast communities should not be disadvantaged through the introduction of a toll. Managing director Chris Brown said "We don't expect north coast communities to pay 10 bucks to go and get a bottle of milk".

<h2>Key facts</h2>

<ul>
BULLET::::- Within NSW Pacific Highway extends from the &lt;a href="w%3ABradfield%20Highway"&gt;Bradfield Highway&lt;/a&gt; in Sydney and runs approximately 900 km to the NSW/Queensland border.
BULLET::::- Approximately 140 km of the Pacific Highway was superseeded from Sydney to Newcastle by the F3 (Sydney - Newcastle) Freeway. The F3 opened in sections from 1963 to 1993.
BULLET::::- The section of highway being focused on by the two governments is between Hexham and the NSW/QLD Border. This runs parallel to the NSW North Coast. It is around 730 km in length. Since 1996, less than half of the highway has been duplicated.
BULLET::::- At present there is no direct link between the F3 freeway and Pacific Highway.
BULLET::::- When the Pacific Highway is upgraded, there will be around 910 km of continuous motorway between Wahroonga in Sydney's North and Brisbane.
BULLET::::- The National Highway (utilising the F3 and New England Highway) between Wahroonga and Brisbane is around 930Km in length

&lt;a href="Egypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;ian opposition leader and former candidate in presidential election Ayman Nour has been sentenced today for 5 years imprisonment, as it was reported by both officials and Nour's lawyer. According to the court, he and his liberal democratic party, Ghad, falsified signatures required to register a political party in January 2005. Both Nour's punishment and his imprisonment have been condemned by the international community.

Nour, who stood as a candidate in the recent presidential election, held on September 7 2005, claims that there was political pressure on the judgement and he'll take it to the court of cassation. The leader's lawyer, Amir Salim, said that the verdict would be annulled by the appeal court, as Associated Press reports.

Groups of Nour's supporters, organized mainly by his wife Gameela Ismail, protested against the decision and the style of government of current president &lt;a href="Hosni%20Mubarak"&gt;Hosni Mubarak&lt;/a&gt;, shouting "Down with Mubarak, Down with the regime."

Ayman Nour was arrested in January, 2005 and then imprisoned. He was released when the presidential campaign started.

&lt;a href="w%3AEvo%20Morales"&gt;Evo Morales&lt;/a&gt;, newly elected President of &lt;a href="w%3ABolivia"&gt;Bolivia&lt;/a&gt;, requested that the European Union fund a study to track &lt;a href="w%3ACoca"&gt;coca&lt;/a&gt;. The study will focus on what happens to the coca and how much of it makes its way into the drug trade. According to Angel Gutiérrez, the EU has agreed and will donate US $499,800 for the study, but will not participate in its implementation. Morales has requested similar studies in the past, prior to being elected.

Morales himself owns a coca farm and his Socialist Movement Party got its birth in the union of coca farmers. Although the coca leaf is also used to make &lt;a href="w%3ACocaine"&gt;cocaine&lt;/a&gt;, Morales and his union have fought attempts to eradicate growth of the crop. It is also used by indigenous in religious ceremonies and to chew (to fight fatigue).

The first round of the &lt;a href="w%3AHaitian%20elections%2C%202006"&gt;presidential elections&lt;/a&gt;, currently scheduled for January 8, 2006, might have to be delayed, according to some members of the electoral council. This would mark the 4th time the presidential elections have been moved, and the 5th time for all elections.

The chairman of the council, Max Mathurin, expressed concern over political unrest that could occur if conditions were not adequate to ensure fair elections. He said, "If certain major technical problems are not solved, elections on Jan. 8 could be a catastrophe." The problems related to the current possible postponement involve distribution of voter identification cards, a lack of poll centers, and recruitment of poll center workers. According to Reuters, only 500,000 of the 3.5 million voter identification cards have been handed out and few of the 40,000 needed poll workers have been recruited.

Rosemond Pradel, Secretary-General of the electoral council, told reporters that sometime between January 22 and January 29 would likely be the new dates of the elections are indeed rescheduled. However one council member, Patrick Fequiere, suggested that several months might be needed to guarantee fair elections. Pradel blames the delays, in part, on the Organization of American States (OAS). He is quoted as saying, "Our decision to set the January 8th deadline for the first round was based on OAS' commitment that voting cards distribution would have been completed by December 25."

However the OAS struck back in Friday saying that "Ninety per cent of the cards are already in the electoral centres, waiting for people to pick them up," and "Our problem is that most voters have stopped coming to the centres," according to OAS spokeperson Louise Brunet. Denneth Modeste, OAS ambassador to Haiti, says that people are not coming to the centres to pick up their cards because they don't believe the elections will take place as scheduled. She said that "the Provisional Electoral Council should be the leading agency inciting people to collect their cards, instead of spreading doubts."

One presidential candidate, Evans Paul, complained about the problems saying "I've never seen elections so poorly organized," and "it's not acceptable that people have to struggle for hours in line to register, they have to do the same to get the voting cards, and now they have to walk six hours to reach a place to cast their ballot."

Max Mathurin says that they should know by next week whether or not the current date of January 8, 2006 is a realistic target for holding the first round of the presidential elections. Juan Gabriel Valdes of the UN's peacekeeping missions says that his people are completely ready for elections if they are to take place on January 8th.

Sixteen people were injured on Friday when a homemade bomb exploded in a crowded &lt;a href="w%3AS%C3%A3o%20Paulo"&gt;São Paulo&lt;/a&gt; street in Brazil. The blast took place on March 25 Street where it was crowded with Christmas shoppers. According to the police the bomb was left in a trash can. One police official Patricia Fernandes said, "apparently (the bomb) was an amateur device but we haven't completed the examination."

One woman remains hospitalized in serious condition. According to police the other victims did not suffer life-threatening injuries. The local media is saying that a pregnant woman and a 5 year old girl were also injured, but police did not confirm this.

The bombing is believed to be related to police raids on counterfeit dealers in the area. Fernandes stated that "One line of investigation is that this was a reprisal for for [♡❤sic♡❤] police actions in the area."

The U.S. task force on &lt;a href="w%3APuerto%20Rico"&gt;Puerto Rico's&lt;/a&gt; status has requested that the U.S. Congress set a date for a plebiscite in Puerto Rico whereby the people would be able to decide if the commonwealth would like to change its status. 

The first vote would consist of a simple "yes" or "no" vote on changing the current commonwealth status. From there, if the vote went in favor of changing status, Congress could then set another date for a vote on whether the people favor independence or statehood. Co-chair Ruben Barrales said, "We hope that Congress will take a look at the recommendations and hopefully move the question forward."

In past plebiscites, Puerto Ricans are divided relatively evenly between statehood and commonwealth status. Those who favor independence are in a small minority. Currently Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens and receive many of the benefits that the federal government offers, but cannot vote in national elections and do not pay federal taxes. If Puerto Rico were to become a state of the U.S., it could mean a shift in the balance of power in Congress and in presidential elections.

The press release including the question and answer section can be viewed . The recommendation calls for 2 polls, one on whether to remain at the status quo and the second to decide between independence and statehood. This could create some controversy. In the past there has been a 1 single poll with all options included. There is also the issue on "free association" which falls somewhere between commonwealth status and independence. Some in Puerto Rico might argue that these options are too narrow and stacked against a commonwealth status.

On Devember 24, 2005, two Massachusetts newspapers reported that a University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth student has admitted to falsely claiming a visit from the U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security over a library book. The student has since revealed that his story was a hoax.

The story was first reported in the New Bedford Standard-Times on December 17, 2005. This hoax was widely disseminated by other news and opinion outlets, including Wikinews. The student has not revealed his motivation for the hoax; however, he was taking a class on totalitarianism at the time, and a possible extension of the U.S. &lt;a href="w%3APatriot%20Act"&gt;Patriot Act&lt;/a&gt; was being debated in congress.

&lt;a href="w%3AChad"&gt;Chad&lt;/a&gt; has declared their border with &lt;a href="w%3ASudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt; a "military operations zone" and has also declared a "state of belligerance" exists between Chad and Sudan. Chadian President &lt;a href="w%3AIdriss%20Deby"&gt;Idriss Deby&lt;/a&gt; described Sudanese President &lt;a href="w%3AOmar%20Hassan%20al-Bashir"&gt;Omar Hassan al-Bashir&lt;/a&gt; as an "enemy of Chad." The government also called on its citizens to "mobilize against this Sudanese aggression." This comes at the heels of increased aggression between the two nations, namely the December 18 attacks against the border town of Adre.

While the Chadian government fell short of declaring war against Sudan, this is the toughest statement President Idriss Deby has made so far. &lt;nowiki&gt;[cited]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;a href="http%3A//edition.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/africa/12/23/chad.sudan.reut/"&gt;link title&lt;/a&gt;

A group of Australian entertainers have sacrificed Christmas at home to spread some Christmas cheer among 450 troops deployed in Iraq. The show was put on for troops in the Al Muthanna Task group at a base near the town of As Samawah.

Performer Little Pattie (Patricia Thompson), who entertained Australian and allied troops during the Vietnam War at the age of 17, led the entertainment. She was joined by Beccy Cole, Angry Anderson, Hayley Jensen, Bessie Bardot, Geoff Barker and Lehmo.

"I feel I'm here to continue a time-honoured tradition which is of Australian performers performing for Australian forces no matter where they are in the world," Little Pattie said.

"It's a thing as a country we need to constantly be reminded of that they represent us as a nation around the world" said Angry Anderson.

The Christmas spirit also reached HMAS Parramatta, which is deployed to protect Iraq's oil infrastructure in the Persian Gulf. The HMAS Parramatta sailors received a surprise visit from Santa Claus who handed out presents.

Hrant Dink, Arat Dink, Serkis Seropyan and Aydın Engin, all employees of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAgos"&gt;Agos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , an &lt;a href="Armenia"&gt;Armenian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Anewspaper"&gt;newspaper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; published in &lt;a href="%C4%B0stanbul"&gt;İstanbul&lt;/a&gt;, have each been charged with "attempting to affect legal proceedings" by the Sisli 2nd First Instance Court for their alleged attempts to tamper with Hrant Dink's trial earlier this year. The four &lt;a href="journalism"&gt;journalists&lt;/a&gt; will be tried under the 288th article of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATurkish%20Penal%20Code"&gt;Turkish Penal Code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and face a possible 6 months to 3 years in jail if found guilty.

In his &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aindictment"&gt;indictment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the public prosecutor claimed that the defendants attempted to influence the result of Hrant Dink's earlier trial by way of articles published in Agos, of which Dink is the editor. In response to the indictment, Hrant Dink said, "It is impossible for a man not to be puzzled. I am the defendant at the same time. It is a basic right for a defendant to attempt to affect the legal proceedings. If a defendant is not trying to affect the legal proceedings, then he would do this? We would go, face the court and see the results."

Hrant Dink was found guilty in October of insulting &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;'s national identity, a conviction for which he received a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Asuspended%20sentence"&gt;suspended sentence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of 6 months imprisonment. He claims he will appeal this decision.

According to the Scotsman newspaper, the directors of the &lt;a href="w%3A2012%20Summer%20Olympics"&gt;2012 London Olympics&lt;/a&gt; have insisted that the city won the right to host the games "fairly and squarely" after claims were touted by an Israeli official that a "potentially decisive vote was cast in error by an International Olympic Committee (IOC) official"

The Israeli official, Alex Gilady, claims that in the third round of voting, Greek delegate Lambis Nikolaou may have accidentally voted for Paris rather than Madrid, resulting in eliminating Madrid rather than Paris from the final round. 

London spokesmen and bid leaders have dismissed the claims as "folklore stories", "totally irrelevant" and "tittle-tattle", while the CEO of the Madrid bid told the London Times, "We were very close to winning. We can never know if the Greek vote would have been decisive, but it is lamentable for one human error to have ruined all our hard work."

The &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Wheat%20Board"&gt;Australian Wheat Board&lt;/a&gt; (AWB), the primary economic authority for Australian wheat export is set to lose its long-standing trade contract with Iraq worth $270m/annum to United States exporters after a deal was struck with Iraqi Wheat Board for a majority share of the $500m wheat market.

Aggressive lobbying by United States trade diplomats used the imminent uncovering of AWB involvement in the &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_for_food%23Oil_for_wheat"&gt;Oil for Wheat&lt;/a&gt; incident as fodder in their recent negotiations. The AWB's previous arrangement saw the use of &lt;a href="w%3AAeroLinea%20Internacional%20di%20Aruba"&gt;Alia&lt;/a&gt;, a Jordanian based transport corporation owned by the wealthy &lt;a href="w%3AAl-Khawam"&gt;Al-Khawam&lt;/a&gt; family, to transport their wheat to Umm Qasr, a southern sea port in Iraq.

"There has been obvious corruption in procurement and there were illegal and illegitimate transfers of huge funds abroad, outside the control of the Iraqi state," said Iraq's finance minister, &lt;a href="w%3AAli%20Adbul-Amir%20Allawi"&gt;Ali Allawi&lt;/a&gt;.

The UN report headed by &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Volcker"&gt;Paul Volcker&lt;/a&gt; (former Chairman of the United States Federal Reserve), released in October 2005, noted that the AWB was aware the Iraqi Government used Alia as a backdoor for obtaining $310m in kickbacks under the guise as 'transport costs' and adjusted their price for the wheat accordingly which was noticeably higher than their trading price with importers in other regions.

"Numerous aspects of the AWB-Alia relationship suggest that some employees of AWB were placed on notice of facts strongly suggesting that AWB's payments were in whole or part for the benefit of the government of Iraq." said Vockler.

&lt;a href="w%3ASheik%20Hussein%20al-Khawam"&gt;Sheik Hussein al-Khawam&lt;/a&gt; head of the Shiite &lt;a href="w%3AAl-Kahawam"&gt;Al-Kahawam&lt;/a&gt; influential family business operation including &lt;a href="w%3ATeebah"&gt;Teebah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAeroLinea%20Internacional%20di%20Aruba"&gt;Alia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Huda%20International%20Trading%20Company"&gt;Al Huda International Trading Company&lt;/a&gt; recently assumed its control on the newly established Iraqi Airlines in alliance with the new Iraqi Government, has been under heavy scrutiny from some influential US political analysts, including Volcker and which accuse the family of corruption due to dealings with &lt;a href="w%3ASaddam%20Hussien"&gt;Saddam Hussien&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Background</h2>

Recently the AWB has scrutinised the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Agriculture"&gt;United States Department of Agriculture&lt;/a&gt; (USDA) for suspending the AWB from participating in a USDA credit-export scheme &lt;a href="http%3A//awb.com.au/aboutawb/media/mediareleases/USDAActionsUnjustified.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

The famous &lt;a href="w%3AGreek"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; lawyers, Sakis Kechagioglou and George Nikolakopoulos have been imprisoned in the &lt;a href="w%3AAthens"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt;' jail of Korydallus, as they were found guilty of graft and corruption. As a result of this, a big scandal within the Greek legal community has been raised through the exposure of illegal actions that judges, lawyers, solicitors and attorneys have done during the previous years. A few weeks ago, after the information published by the journalist Makis Triantafylopoulos in his popular Television show "Zoungla" in Alpha TV, the member of Parliament and lawyer, Petros Mantouvalos was abdicated as members of his office had been involved in illegal graft and corruption. Moreover, top judge Evangelos Kalousis is imprisoned as he found guilty of corruption and degenerate behaviour.

Except from journalists' research about scandals in the legal Community of Greece, accusations from well-known lawyers and attorneys such as the famous Athens' lawyer Alexis Kougias, against colleagues have as a result a greater dialogue and discussion in the country upon this important issue.

Native Americans are petitioning Congress to investigate the elite &lt;a href="w%3ASkull%20and%20Bones"&gt;Skull and Bones&lt;/a&gt; group and return what they believe are the remains of Apache warrior Geronimo for reburial. 

The petition alleges that Geronimo's grave was robbed in 1918 by members of the society, including &lt;a href="w%3APrescott%20Bush"&gt;Prescott Bush&lt;/a&gt;, President George W. Bush's grandfather. The alleged graverobbers stole Geronimo's head and his prized silver bridle, which had been buried with him. These allegations are also within a book by Yale graduate, Alexandra Robbins, titled; "Secrets of the Tomb". Robbins suggests that the reason these men robbed graves is; "Bones as a society is preoccupied with death; skulls, skeletons, and artwork depicting death are prevalent in the tomb. When Bonesmen steal things they use the euphemism that they are taking 'gifts to the goddess' whom they honor within the tomb." 

Robbins also said; "I think it's ridiculous that Bonesmen's sense of entitlement is broad enough to include items that allegedly don't belong to them. The items they supposedly steal as a prank or competition may be valuable and meaningful to the actual owners. It's appalling that proper authorities have not forced their way into the tomb to retrieve the items that don't belong in there."

An economics professor at Clark College, James Craven, suggests that; "In the near future, there will finally be large groups of Natives showing up in front of 'the tomb' to protest this ugly racism and grave robbing by the Bones, and they will not be leaving until that skull and any other Native artifacts have been returned...[The theft] is a metaphor for something much bigger and even uglier. It is the ugly racism and hubris of the in-bred power elites who seek to infiltrate positions of power."

In her book, Robbins also reports that Apaches met with Skull and Bones representatives following their admission by letter that they did in fact have a skull they called "Geronimo". The Apaches were offered some bones, but refused to accept them at that time because, according to the petition; "It was obviously not the skull seen in the smuggled photograph."

Endicott Davison, an attorney for Skull and Bones, denied that Geronimo's skull is in the possession of the group.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia's&lt;/a&gt; most experienced state leader - &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Beattie"&gt;Peter Beattie&lt;/a&gt; has given his strongest indication for a move to federal politics.

Beattie, who has been the Premier of &lt;a href="w%3AQueensland"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt; for seven-and-a-half years indicated that he only wishes to stay on for another term in state parliament and that he would never say no to federal politics. He further added "I'd love to see the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Labor Party&lt;/a&gt; govern federally and you never rule out federal aspirations".

"But frankly, from my point of view, it's more important to deliver on all the things I promised we would deliver on" said Beattie. Beattie will be working over the holiday period to repair the crises that have engulfed his government this year. His government is yet to recover from a slump in two-party preferred polls following the &lt;a href="w%3AJayant%20Patel"&gt;Doctor Death&lt;/a&gt; scandal, which exposed major problems in Queensland's health system.

Mr Beattie said he would lead his party to victory in 2007 and serve out another term as premier, but indicated he would consider his "exit strategy" ahead of the 2010 state election. "I'm not someone who wants to stay forever" said Mr Beattie.

Mr Beattie has been grooming his successor, Deputy Premier Anna Bligh and plans to make her Treasurer if Labor wins the next election.

Mr Beattie said his agenda for next year in Queensland included implementing health reforms, furthering his Smart State strategy and kick-starting a multi-billion-dollar plan for infrastructure projects.

The man had several wounds, a police spokesperson said. He was pronounced dead at a hospital. No arrests have been made. Police are continuing to investigate.

&lt;a href="w%3ALawrence%20Wilkerson"&gt;Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson&lt;/a&gt;, who was Colin Powell's chief-of-staff, is attracting news headlines around the globe &lt;a href="http%3A//news.search.yahoo.com/news/search%3Fp%3Dcheney%2Bwilkerson%26amp%3Bsm%3DYahoo%2521%2BSearch%26amp%3Btoggle%3D1%26amp%3Bei%3DUTF-8%26amp%3Bfr%3DFP-tab-web-t"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by publicly accusing members of the Bush administration. He said in a speech at the New America Foundation: "What I saw was a cabal between the Vice President of the United States, Richard Cheney, and the Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, on critical issues that made decisions that the bureaucracy did not know were being made."

Regarding Karen Hughes's attempts to improve the country's image abroad? "It's hard to sell [manure]," Wilkerson said. "If you're unilaterally declaring &lt;a href="w%3AKyoto%20Protocol"&gt;Kyoto&lt;/a&gt; dead, if you're declaring the &lt;a href="w%3AGeneva%20Conventions"&gt;Geneva Conventions&lt;/a&gt; not operative, if you're doing a host of things that the world doesn't agree with you on and you're doing it blatantly and in their face, without grace, then you've got to pay the consequences" said the man who was chief of staff at the State Department until early 2005.

Wilkerson also described President Bush's behavior as "cowboyism" and Condoleezza Rice as "extremely weak."

The colonel described Colin Powell as "the world's most loyal soldier," but said he felt his loyalty belongs not to the administration, but to the country.

An email allegedly from Powell told Wilkerson: "Don't characterize my loyalty."

A new medal has been created for &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealanders"&gt;New Zealanders&lt;/a&gt; who helped in recovery efforts after the &lt;a href="w%3ABoxing%20Day%20Tsunami"&gt;Boxing Day Tsunami&lt;/a&gt;.

Called the New Zealand Special Service Medal (Asian Tsunami) it recognises the work of New Zealanders who went to the region after the tsunami; locating the missing, identifying the dead, and assisting those left behind. Defence Minister &lt;a href="w%3APhil%20Goff"&gt;Phil Goff&lt;/a&gt; says New Zealanders who served in the devastated areas in the first two months after the tsunami, are to receive the medal. 

In a provisional list; which was released today; 163 New Zealanders are honoured in which 37 are non-military or police personnel (including aid workers).

Also, forty-seven police officers will receive the honour for their work identifying bodies in &lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;. 

Prime Minister &lt;a href="Helen%20Clark"&gt;Helen Clark&lt;/a&gt; said the medal recognised "the special service of those New Zealanders who undertook often harrowing tasks in dangerous conditions".

In &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;'s second largest city, &lt;a href="Saint%20Petersburg%2C%20Russia"&gt;St. Petersburg&lt;/a&gt;, four gas attacks left more than 70 people ill. Devices with wires, timers, and glass vials of a gas determined on scene to be &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Amethyl%20mercaptan"&gt;methyl mercaptan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; were found in outlets of Makisdom, a home improvement chain store. The chemical is both naturally occurring and manufactured and is used as an oderant for detection of propane or natural gas leaks.

Store officials have said that they had received threats that sales would be disrupted before New Year's. Russians traditionally give gifts on the holiday. Police officials said they believed a commercial dispute or a prank not terrorism.

The local emergency hospital was overflowed from the influx of ill people from the attacks. Valentina Matviyenko, Governer of St. Petersburg, said that those who sought medical help were not suffering any further medical problems.

A custodian at one of the stores found the devices and alerted police. The devices were found at another store with their vials broken. The devices in the two other stores were carried outside by employees and covered with buckets. The police explosives experts defused them.

According to the El Tiempo newspaper, &lt;a href="Colombia"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;n drug lords and rebels maintain at least 42 aircraft. The fleet includes five light Cessna planes, four reconnaissance helicopters and a helicopter set up as an air ambulance. They are also used to transport people and drugs.

The country's biggest guerrilla group, the left-wing FARC, operates between 15 and 20 aircraft, most acquired in the early 90's from defunct drug cartels.

Right-wing fighters operating in eastern and south-eastern Colombia run seven aircraft, while drug traffickers in the southeastern Valle province have between 15 and 20 aircraft.

According to a captured terrorist, the head of fighters in Meta, in central Colombia, has a Bell helicopter and a Cessna airplane for his personal use. Additionally, a drug lord in Valle province owns a private plane large enough for 14 passengers.

After the &lt;a href="w%3ABattle%20of%20Adre"&gt;Battle of Ardre&lt;/a&gt;, many civilians and military officers of both &lt;a href="w%3AChad"&gt;Chadian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASudan"&gt;Sudanese&lt;/a&gt; origin were killed. After this, Chad declared (according to some translations) a "&lt;a href="w%3Astate%20of%20war"&gt;a state of war&lt;/a&gt;" against Sudan, and encouraged all of its people to honor that declaration. There have been many conflicting reports of the number of deaths, but a good estimate would be that both sides have lost around 400-600 people. 

These battles and declarations is just a continuation of the &lt;a href="w%3ADarfur%20Conflict"&gt;Darfur&lt;/a&gt; that has ravaged this region for several years past. As tensions between the two nations get more fierce, we can only imagine what might come next.

A neighbor of the &lt;a href="w%3AColombian%20President"&gt;Colombian President&lt;/a&gt; called police when they found a bag near the road close to President &lt;a href="w%3AAlvaro%20Uribe"&gt;Alvaro Uribe's&lt;/a&gt; farm. Soldiers who then inspected the bag found 11 pounds (5 kilograms) of &lt;a href="w%3AC4%20explosives"&gt;C4 explosives&lt;/a&gt;, detonator cords, and other material needed to assemble an explosive device. The President's spokeperson said, "They found all the elements of a bomb but it had not been assembled and it was not ready to be detonated."

Uribe then left the farm and went to stay on another of his farms, this one in his home province Antioquia, for the remainder of the holidays.

Uribe has been the target of multiple assassination attempts, usually by marxist guerillas. He was, for example, the target of assassination attempts while he was campaigning and then again on his inauguration in 2002. His father was assassinated by marxist guerillas. The administration blames the rebel group Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia for most of the attempts on the president's life.

On Friday &lt;a href="w%3AWarner%20Music%20Group"&gt;Warner Music Group&lt;/a&gt; announced that it had been subpoenaed by the office of New York Attorney-General &lt;a href="w%3AEliot%20Spitzer"&gt;Eliot Spitzer&lt;/a&gt; to provide information about digital music download pricing. It has been reported that Sony BMG Music Entertainment and Vivendi Universal have also received subpoenas.

The subpoenas are thought to be connected to an antitrust investigation being carried out by New York Attorney-General Eliot Spitzer. The investigation is believed to be looking at whether Warner, Sony BMG, EMG and Universal have colluded to set wholesale song download pricing. 

Will Tanous, speaking on behalf of Warner Music group said "As part of an industrywide investigation concerning pricing of digital music downloads, we received a subpoena from Attorney General Spitzer's office as disclosed in our public filings. We are cooperating fully with the inquiry."

It is also thought that the investigation may be due to the music industry wishing to renegotiate pricing with Apple over its iTunes online store. The record companies have indicated that they wish to begin variable pricing on music downloads. Apple currently sells songs for $US0.99 each.

In September, Warner CEO Edgar Bronfman told an investor conference that "not all songs are created equal ... There are some songs for which consumers would be willing to pay more and some we'd be willing to sell for less".

The Nine Network has announced the death of one of &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia's&lt;/a&gt; richest men, &lt;a href="w%3AKerry%20Packer"&gt;Kerry Packer&lt;/a&gt;, aged 68.

Announcer Richard Wilkins said on the Today Show that he had just been handed official confirmation of Mr Packer's death at 68.

He said a statement from Tony Ritchie, Nine head of news, said: "Mrs Kerry Packer and her children James and Gretel sadly report the passing last evening of her husband and their father Kerry. He died peacefully at home with his family at his bedside".

Packer was the major shareholder in &lt;a href="w%3APublishing%20and%20Broadcasting%20Limited"&gt;Publishing and Broadcasting Limited&lt;/a&gt; (PBL) which owns the Nine television network and &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Consolidated%20Press"&gt;Australian Consolidated Press&lt;/a&gt;, the producer of many Australian and New Zealand magazines.

Packer was also involved in the gambling and tourism industries and owned the &lt;a href="w%3ACrown%20Casino"&gt;Crown Casino&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;.

In the &lt;a href="w%3A1970s"&gt;1970s&lt;/a&gt;, his &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Series%20Cricket"&gt;World Series Cricket&lt;/a&gt; revolutionised &lt;a href="w%3Acricket"&gt;cricket&lt;/a&gt;, bringing &lt;a href="w%3AOne-day%20cricket"&gt;One-day cricket&lt;/a&gt; to the fore by introducing things such as coloured uniforms, white balls &amp; day/night matches.

&lt;a href="w%3ABusiness%20Review%20Weekly"&gt;Business Review Weekly&lt;/a&gt; magazine estimated Packer's net worth at AU$6.5 billion in 2004. Another famous rich Australian media magnate, who may have lost his Australian nationality, is &lt;a href="w%3ARupert%20Murdoch"&gt;Rupert Murdoch&lt;/a&gt;.

The well-known character actor, &lt;a href="w%3AVincent%20Schiavelli"&gt;Vincent Schiavelli&lt;/a&gt; has died at his home in Polizzi Generosa, Sicily. He was 57.

Schiavelli appeared in more than 120 films and television shows including the movie "Ghost" where he played opposite Patrick Swayze. He was selected in 1997 by Vanity Fair as one of the best character actors in the United States.

Vincent Schiavelli could do with a glance what many actors work a lifetime to perfect. Schiavelli had the countenance of one of Dali's melting clocks, the hooded eyes of a mobster and the smile of someone who might be light years off his meds.

It was a look that launched his career. By the time Schiavelli died at age 57, he had starred in 150 television shows and movies. He had a name people couldn't remember and a face people couldn't forget.

Japan's population declined by 19,000 in 2005 according to the government census, marking the first time it has shrunk since 1899, when it began keeping records. The decline is caused by the low birth rate of 1.29 children per woman. The declining birth rate has been a concern for the island nation for the last few decades as it supports a larger elderly population; 20% of Japan's population is 65 or older. As of October 1, the population was recorded at 127,757,000.

Blue Springs, Missouri police say a woman they thought had tried to swallow her cell phone may have been the victim of assault. The cell phone was caught in the woman's throat when police arrived. Her boyfriend claimed she had swallowed it to keep it away from him.

Melinda Abell required emergency surgery to remove the phone from her throat. Police have now charged the boyfriend, Marlon Brandon Gill, 23, with assault.

Police Sgt. Allen Kintz told the Associated Press that "Our initial press release was that she had swallowed a cell phone. Subsequent investigation found that she didn't swallow the cell phone voluntarily. That was what we were told initially."

The &lt;a href="w%3A%20United%20States%20Naval%20Observatory"&gt;U.S. Naval Observatory&lt;/a&gt; in Washington D.C. will adjust &lt;a href="w%3A%20Atomic%20clock"&gt;atomic clocks&lt;/a&gt; by pausing (adding) a second, and thus let time pass without counting it for the &lt;a href="w%3A%20Coordinated%20Universal%20Time"&gt;Coordinated Universal Time&lt;/a&gt; or UTC on December 31st. The mark-time will occur on the last tick prior to the 2006 new year.

The accuracy of atomic clocks is based upon the resonance of caesium 133, which was used to define (in 1958) the second as the length of time for 9,192,631,770 cycles of vibration as they pass through a magnetic field. The resonate constancy of &lt;a href="w%3Acaesium"&gt;caesium&lt;/a&gt; exceeds the accuracy of the Earth’s rotation around the Sun.

Because the Earth’s spin will fluctuate due to lunar tides and atmospheric winds, the &lt;a href="w%3A%20International%20Earth%20Rotation%20and%20Reference%20Systems%20Service"&gt;International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service&lt;/a&gt; has had to request 22 'leap seconds' since 1972. The last adjustment made to the UTC was in 1998.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; Federal &lt;a href="w%3AGovernment%20of%20Australia"&gt;Government&lt;/a&gt; has indicated that it will overhaul copyright law in 2006. The changes will legalise the recording of television shows and the right to transfer CDs to portable music devices.

The reforms, instigated by Attorney-General &lt;a href="w%3APhillip%20Ruddock"&gt;Phillip Ruddock&lt;/a&gt; aim to add "fair use" clauses for personal use.

A spokeswoman for Mr Ruddock said the Government was close to finalising draft laws which would allow people to copy music from CDs legitimately to their own portable music devices and tape television to watch later.

At present both "time shifting" (recording a television show to watch later) and "format shifting" (copying a legally owned CD to another format such as MP3 for play on a portable device) are illegal in Australia. While the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Federal%20Police"&gt;Australian Federal Police&lt;/a&gt; do not pursue offenders, it still must act upon every complaint.

It is unknown whether the new laws will force a levy on blank CDs and portable music devices as they did when the laws were introduced in &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;.

Former Spanish PM &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AJose%20Maria%20Aznar"&gt;Jose Maria Aznar&lt;/a&gt; has described the &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ANATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; alliance as a zombie organization that needs to reform or is going to die. He said that in order to fight the “dark forces” of islamic terrorism NATO needs to take in like-minded nations such as &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; and create a strategic association with regional powers such as &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AColombia"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;.

NATO is structured in such a way that U.S. generals have operational and tactical control. There are two commands, one for transformation and one for operations; each with a Supreme Allied Commander being the highest ranking military officer.

Allied Command Operations (ACO) is in Belgium and is headed by the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) who is always an American four star general with the dual role of heading U.S. European Command as well. The Allied Command Transformation (ACT) is in Virginia,USA. It is headed by the Supreme Allied Commander Transformation (SACT) who is always a U.S. admiral with the dual role of commander U.S. Joint Forces Command (COMUSJFCOM).

A tentative contract agreement has been struck, five days after &lt;a href="New%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; was ground to a halt in a transit strike. The executive board of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATransport%20Workers%20Union"&gt;Transport Workers Union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (TWU) Local 100 and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMetropolitan%20Transportation%20Authority%20%28New%20York%29"&gt;Metropolitan Transportation Agency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (MTA) had been negotiating under a media blackout, but terms of the agreement have started to come to light: A 3% increase in salary the first year, 4% increase the second year, and a 3.5% increase in their third year. There will be no changes in the employees' pension plan and the retirement age remains at 55 in exchange for employees contribution of 1.5% of their paycheck.

The new contract still must be approved by the state-run authority's board, whose next regular meeting is on January 25, 2006. There is no word yet if a special meeting will be called. 

The Union's workers will vote by mail, a process which may take weeks to complete.

Union members probably will ratify the contract because it would be "near suicidal" to strike again, says Gary Chaison, professor of labour relations at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AClark%20University"&gt;Clark University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWorcester%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Worcester&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Massachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;.

<h3>Background</h3>

Thirty-four thousand &lt;a href="w%3ATransport%20Workers%20Union"&gt;Transport Workers Union&lt;/a&gt; members walked off the job on December 20, when negotiations broke down over disagreements concerning pensions, health benefits, and pay. The strike, which lasted three days, affected an estimated 7 million commuters daily.

The Chicago Tribune is reporting that five U.S. defense contractor lobbying groups have held back on passing legislation that would ban contractors from involvement in human trafficking for forced prostitution and labor. The congressional mandate was a response to a variety of abuses around the world including labor conditions imposed upon some Iraqis working with contractors in Iraq and a sex slave ring operated by Dyncorp employees during the Bosnian conflict in the 90's.

Congress ordered the Pentagon to implement regulations barring such practices two years ago; and the Pentagon drafted the necessary regulations in the summer of 2005. However, defense contractors such as &lt;a href="w%3ADynCorp%20International"&gt;DynCorp&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AHalliburton"&gt;Halliburton&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AKBR"&gt;KBR&lt;/a&gt; claim that key portions of the defense department's proposal are unrealistic.

Black American women living in communities with high poverty rates are significantly less likely to be screened for cervical cancer, a study finds. 

The Harvard School of Public Health's Geetanjali Dabral Datta investigated the relationship between individual characteristics and larger socioeconomic factors and cervical cancer screening rates. The Febreuary 1 issue of ♡❤Cancer♡❤ carries the study. More than 40,000 black women from across the United States participated in the Black Women's Health Study.

"African-American women have twice the mortality rate from cervical cancer as white women," said Elizabeth Ward, the director of the American Cancer Society. "Researchers need to investigate how those differences are related to socioeconomic status. One of the big factors that may account for this finding is access to high-quality medical care. Often communities that have high poverty rates either lack access to good quality care, or people have to travel longer distances to obtain high-quality care."

David L. Katz at Yale University's School of Medicine said; "While this finding is not surprising, it is noteworthy just the same. No one should die of cervical cancer, because a simple screening test reliably finds the condition in its earliest stages when cure is almost universally achievable. Yet, several thousand deaths from this cancer occur each year in the U.S."

Jürgen Chrobog, former &lt;a href="w%3ASecretary%20of%20State%23Germany"&gt;Secretary of State&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AForeign%20Office%20%28Germany%29"&gt;German Foreign Office&lt;/a&gt;, was abducted today in eastern &lt;a href="w%3AYemen"&gt;Yemen&lt;/a&gt;, along with his wife, their three children, and three locals.

The family was travelling as part of a large group in the country when their vehicle went missing around 460 km east of the capital &lt;a href="w%3ASana%C3%A1"&gt;Sanaá&lt;/a&gt;. According the Yemeni interior ministry they were abducted by a tribal group.

&lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt; named the captors as members of the ♡❤Al-Abdullah♡❤ tribe who told the news agency by phone that the life of the family is not in danger and that they are their "guests". They are reportedly demanding that the Yemeni government release member of their tribe from prison.

A spokesperson for the German Foreign Office said it is unknown whether Chrobog was singled out or if it was just a coincidence that he and his family were taken.

Chrobog had been the German ambassador to the United States from 1994 till 2001 when he transferred to the Foreign Office, where he himself negotiated the release of Germans held abroad.

This incident is the fourth time this year that foreigners were abducted in the country to blackmail the Yemeni government.

A shooting at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Institute%20of%20Science"&gt;Indian Institute of Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , at &lt;a href="Bangalore"&gt;Bangalore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, left a professor dead. 

The shooting occurred during a dinner being hosted in honour of a conference which was attended by academicians across the country. Indiscriminate firing by unidentified assailants led to a number of scientists and technicians getting injured, including a professor from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Institute%20of%20Technology"&gt;Indian Institute of Technology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at New Delhi, who later died of his injuries. Police believe an automatic weapon was used. The assailants, who reportedly drove in unchallenged through the main gates, have not yet been apprehended, and Bangalore is currently in a state of lockdown, with a red alert being declared by the government. No terrorist outfits have claimed responsibility yet. 

The name of the Professor who was killed in the attack was M.C.Puri a retired professor of mathematics in IIT, Delhi.

In &lt;a href="w%3AVista%20Hermosa"&gt;Vista Hermosa&lt;/a&gt;, more than 200 km south &lt;a href="w%3ABogota"&gt;Bogota&lt;/a&gt;, soldiers were guarding &lt;a href="w%3Acoca%20eradication"&gt;coca eradication&lt;/a&gt; workers when they were assaulted by a rebel group, believed to be the &lt;a href="w%3ARevolutionary%20Armed%20Forces%20of%20Colombia"&gt;Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia&lt;/a&gt; or FARC rebel group who operates near the area of the attack. Reports are varying between 24 and 28 Colombian soldiers were killed in the attack. The Army first reported that 24 soldiers had been killed, but the defense minister later placed the death toll at 28.

&lt;a href="w%3ANarcotrafficking"&gt;Narcotrafficking&lt;/a&gt; is a key source of funding for the rebel group, and is likely a reason for the attack. &lt;a href="w%3A%C3%81lvaro%20Uribe"&gt;President Uribe&lt;/a&gt; is expected to strike back as a result of this attack. According to Reuters, President Uribe is up for reelection in May and this attack could be related to that. Uribe has negotiated peace agreements with some rebel groups, such as the marxist National Liberation Army, but FARC has refused to speak with the Uribe administration. This attack is the worst that has happened since Uribe came into office in 2002. Uribe's father was killed in a kidnapping attempt by FARC in 1983.

&lt;a href="w%3AN%C3%A9stor%20Kirchner"&gt;President Kirchner&lt;/a&gt; says that &lt;a href="w%3AArgentina"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt; will be able to pay off its &lt;a href="w%3AIMF"&gt;IMF&lt;/a&gt; debt of US$9.8 billion dollars next week following the New Year weekend. The announcement has come with great applause at home, but according to &lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; it has led to a temporary decrease of the value of the &lt;a href="w%3AArgentine%20peso"&gt;Argentine peso&lt;/a&gt; in international markets. Payment was originally scheduled for 2008, and paying off the debt early will save Argentina around $1 billion dollars. The payment is made out of the Central Bank foreign currency reports, which according to CNN total $28 billion.

The &lt;a href="w%3AArgentine%20economic%20crisis%20%281999-2002%29"&gt;economic crisis in Argentina&lt;/a&gt; started with a recession in 1999. People began to withdraw money from their accounts, which resulted in the government freezing bank accounts. Eventually the country would have to default on a large part of their public debt. The crisis led to the increase of the income gap between the rich and the poor, but policies in recent years have brought that back down to previous levels. Argentina had previously renegotiated private debt earlier this year of $100 billion which reduced the amount owed by 75% according to &lt;a href="w%3AABC%20News"&gt;ABC News&lt;/a&gt;.

The rebellion at the Urso Branco (White Bear) State Prison in &lt;a href="w%3APorto%20Velho"&gt;Porto Velho&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of the Brazilian state of &lt;a href="w%3ARondonia"&gt;Rondonia&lt;/a&gt;, has ended.

The rebelling prisoners entered into an agreement with the Brazilian authorities. The Secretary of Public Security of Rondônia, Renato Eduardo de Souza, said that the police officers are ready to enter the prison, examine the prisoners and to place them into the cells, and to free the hostages.

Informations from the prison indicated the death of at least 16 persons during the rebellion. However the deaths have not been confirmed and some prisoners have affirmed that the deaths were faked.

The rebellion at the prison began on Sunday. More than 200 people were held hostage and the prisoners were demanding the return of their leader: Ednildo Paula Souza, aka Birrinha, from another prison.

The authorities agreed and said that Birrinha will be transferred to Urso Branco.

The Australian Centre for Languages, a company which has a multi-million dollar contract with the &lt;a href="w%3AGovernment%20of%20Australia"&gt;Australian government&lt;/a&gt; to provide refugee services, has been accused of breaching its duty of care following the death of a chronically ill child and allegations of failing to provide three women in their care with food.

<h2>Richard Niyonsaba</h2>
A two-and-a-half year old child, Richard Niyonsaba, died less than 24 hours after arriving in &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;.

In November, Richard and his family came to Australia after spending time in a refugee camp in &lt;a href="w%3ATanzania"&gt;Tanzania&lt;/a&gt;. Richard suffered from chronic &lt;a href="w%3ASickle-cell%20disease"&gt;sickle-cell anaemia&lt;/a&gt;.

The boy's father, Protais Ntiranyi had been in the country just 18 hours when he woke, at 4am on November 5 to find his son convulsing. Mr Ntiranyi who was alone with his family in a Fairfield flat was frightened and confused as he did not know what to do to help his son.

The family's case worker, from a company called the Australian Centre for Languages (ACL), had earlier shown them a telephone in the flat and allegedly told them to dial 000 in case of emergency. Mr Ntiranyi had never used a telephone and could not speak English.

Mr Ntiranyi, roamed the neighbourhood screaming for help in his native language. The only attention Mr Ntiranyi got was that of a Sudanese refugee, who couldn't understand what he was saying but knew he was clearly distressed and in need of help. By the time he brought the neighbour to his flat his son had died.

<h2>Denial of food</h2>
Two sisters and another woman from Africa, considered refugees have made claims that they were not provided with food by ACL.

Princess and Yeah Yeah Gbdeah arrived in Sydney on November 4, 2005 and were relocated to Newcastle. The sisters allege that when they arrived in Newcastle, a case worker from ACL presented them with a 12-month lease to sign. They claim that when they refused to sign the lease as they were afraid and unfamiliar with the area that the case worker told them they would not be given any food vouchers.

A third woman, Caroline Nykango, was with the sisters and signed the lease. She was given a $50 food voucher, but did not know how to use it as she had never used a supermarket.

According to the women the only food in the house was an apple, a packet of rice and some oil. The women went without food for 5 days before walking out and meeting a man on the street who took them to a church for assistance.

Princess said "There was no food to eat, she didn't show us how to use the stove, we were sick, we were afraid". "We were told a case worker would come to see us but no case worker came. We told her we didn't want that home, we don't want to sign and she said, 'We will not give you the vouchers unless you sign, we will not give you the food'".

Jenny Witmarsh from ACL said the circumstances described by the women "are not the facts as I understand them".

The two sisters are now living in a house in Hamilton, organised with the help of local citizens.

The matter had been referred to an independent inquiry, which should be completed in early February.

<h2>Background and Criticisms</h2>
In October the federal government awarded a multi-million dollar contract to ACL for the care and resettlement of refugees - work that was previously carried out by non-profit and volunteer organisations.

It is believed that only days before Richard's death doctors at the Newcastle Refugee Health Clinic had written to the Immigration Department warning the government that problems relating to the health of new arrivals in Australia had emerged in the Hunter Valley. ACL also had the contract for the care of refugees in the Hunter Valley.

Organisations which formerly provided care to refugees have strongly criticised ACL saying that they can not provide the level of care that these people require.

The family of Richard Niyonsaba have called on the federal government to review its policy of outsourcing refugee services. The federal government is unlikely to hold an inquiry with the Minister for Multicultural Affairs and Citizenship, John Cobb disagreeing with the family's version of events.

Greg Barnes from Rights Australia is calling for a review saying "We have a child who comes in to Australia who's obviously extremely ill and his parents are really, on the face of it, given very little or no support at all".

A 69 year old woman and her 39 year old son from southern Australia have been charged with drug offenses following their arrest last week. Evelyn Harvey, a pensioner from &lt;a href="w%3APerth"&gt;Perth&lt;/a&gt;, and her son Johnny Harvey, from Prospect have been charged with "(possessing) a prohibited drug with intent" in &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20Australia"&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt;.

West Australian police arrested the pair last week after police intercepted a package sent via road courier, allegedly from the son in South Australia to his mother in Perth. The package containted 3.16kg of compressed &lt;a href="w%3Acannabis"&gt;cannabis&lt;/a&gt; head with a street value of AU$40,700.

Police allege that Mrs. Harvey was knowingly receiving the drugs and distributing them to dealers in Perth.

Detective Senior Saregent Dockery said "If convicted we will apply to the court to have both of them declared drug traffickers". Under Western Australia's crime legislation, the pair's property could be confiscated by the state.

According to police, $5000 in cash was also seized from the pensioner's housing commission unit.

Consumer confidence rose in December to levels closer to those before huricane &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Katrina&lt;/a&gt; according to the Conference Board Consumer Research Center's &lt;a href="w%3AIndex%20of%20Consumer%20Confidence"&gt;consumer confidence index&lt;/a&gt;. The index was at 105.5 before the huricane hit the port of New Orleans disrupting oil production and trade for a large part of the country. The index was at 102.7 in December last year.

The index rose to 103.6 from a revised 98.3 for November. The index was expected to only rise to 102.5. 

"Consumer confidence continues to bounce back and is now at its highest level since Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast" said Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board Consumer Research Center.

Most of the change is attributed to falling gas prices and an improved job outlook.

"The resiliency of the economy, recent declines in prices at the pump, and job growth have consumers feeling more confident at year-end than they felt at the start of 2005," Franco said. "Even though all of the improvement over the past twelve months has been in consumers' assessment of current conditions, and expectations remain below earlier levels, consumers are confident that the economy will continue to expand in 2006."

Police arrived at &lt;a href="w%3AAugusto%20Pinochet"&gt;Augusto Pinochet's&lt;/a&gt; home this morning in the &lt;a href="w%3AChile"&gt;Chilean&lt;/a&gt; capital of &lt;a href="w%3ASantiago%2C%20Chile"&gt;Santiago&lt;/a&gt; to fingerprint the 90 year old man and take a mugshot, in an incident his lawyer called an insult. His lawyer, Pablo Rodriguez, said, "This is insulting but what pains us the most is not that a police record has been made for a former president but that there are no legal grounds to do so," and "this is an arbitrary procedure by the judge." 

Judge Victor Montiglio ordered the mugshots and fingerprints to create a file on Pinochet. He has been under house arrest since November 2005.

Pinochet is being charged in relation to &lt;a href="w%3AOperation%20Colombo"&gt;Operation Colombo&lt;/a&gt;, where 119 political dissidents disappeared during his reign in the mid-1970s. Pinochet's regime claims that they all died in clashes with various opposition groups. A government spokesperson said, "Once more in Chile we can happily affirm that there is equality before the law and that the courts of justice are functioning impeccably."

Pinochet is also in other legal trouble. In November he was indicted for tax fraud and other crimes related to some $27 million in foreign bank accounts, according to &lt;a href="http%3A//today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx%3Ftype%3DworldNews%26amp%3BstoryID%3D2005-12-28T201604Z_01_FOR872931_RTRUKOC_0_US-CHILE-PINOCHET.xml%26amp%3Barchived%3DFalse"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;. And also on Monday he was ruled fit to stand trial for the disappearances in Operation Colombo. This comes as a change of court rulings, previously cases have been dismissed because of medical reasons.

&lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;n prosecutors plan to begin sending legal notices such as indictments and fines via &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AShort%20message%20service"&gt;SMS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInstant%20messaging"&gt;text messaging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The move was prompted by the high percentage of the population carrying mobile phones, as well as the cost and slow delivery of paper notices.

A South Korean official, Lee Young-pyo, said, "Most people in South Korea have mobile phones, and since the notices don't reach them immediately by regular mail, this is a more definite way for the individuals to know they have received a legal notice."

Mr. Lee also emphasized that SMS notices did not replace existing paper notification, and people must apply for the service.

About 70 percent of the South Korean population use mobile phones, according to ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20World%20Factbook"&gt;The World Factbook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤.

A German businessman who had his camera stolen at a restaurant found and made a purchase for the same camera model on &lt;a href="w%3AeBay"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt;. To his surprise, it was his own stolen camera. 

The reason he wanted the same model was because he had matching accessories. The seller was from his hometown, making it even more suspicious. Police on Thursday were questioning a 34-year old vendor. His statement "claims he got the camera at a flea market, but was also offering other cameras on the Internet."

It was reported a month ago on ♡❤The Prague Post♡❤ that two Czech programmers, Dr. Marian Kechlibar and Jiří Šatánek, have developed ♡❤SMS007♡❤, which is a program that advertises that no third party would be able to read text messages sent with this method. "We felt that there is too much phone tapping going on in this country," Šatánek said. "Everyone has a right to their privacy."

The two are working on a version, set for release next northern hemisphere summer (June-August 2006), that will encode phone calls made from cell phones as well. Their Prague company, Circle Tech, is offering a 1 million Korona reward ($40,270 U.S.) to anyone who can crack their code.

The program took about a year to develop and uses AES, a symmetric cipher. There are two keys to their code, one on the sender end and one on the recipient end. The keys to the code are not generated until after a person installs the software on his or her mobile phone.

Dr. Kechlibar is a mathematics professor at the Charles University in Prague.

The Greek newspaper &lt;a href="w%3AProto%20Thema"&gt;Proto Thema&lt;/a&gt; is reporting a member of the British embassy staff in Athens, Nicholas Langman, was involved in the abduction, interrogation and torture of 28 Pakistani-born immigrants to Greece. The alleged victims were detained in connection with the 7 July bombings in London.

The disclosure of British MI6 agents acting openly in Greece has precipitated an uproar in the &lt;a href="w%3AVouli%20ton%20Ellinon"&gt;Vouli ton Ellinon&lt;/a&gt;, with the opposition uniformly calling for the matter to be discussed in the parliament.

"Such a thing never happened, does not happen and won't happen," said Giorgos Voulgarakis, the Greek Minister of Public Order, in early December when the detainees went public with their charges. Jack Straw, British Foreign Minister, has likewise denied the charges.

Nearly 15,000 people turned up to Olympic Stadium Melbourne to see the home side &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne%20Victory"&gt;Melbourne Victory&lt;/a&gt; being held to a draw by the visiting &lt;a href="w%3APerth%20Glory"&gt;Perth Glory&lt;/a&gt; in their round 16 A-League match last night.

Victory where without captain &lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Muscat"&gt;Kevin Muscat&lt;/a&gt; who was out serving a ban from Victory's previous game against Sydney FC. &lt;a href="w%3AArchie%20Thompson"&gt;Archie Thompson&lt;/a&gt; wore the captain's armband for the night for Victory.

In the first game under &lt;a href="w%3AAlan%20Vest"&gt;Alan Vest&lt;/a&gt;, Perth's Glory came in strong and held long to pull the tie from the Victory.

The lead goal came from &lt;a href="w%3ADamian%20Mori"&gt;Damian Mori&lt;/a&gt; for the Glory 5 minutes in, answered by Thompson and &lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Allsop"&gt;Daniel Allsop&lt;/a&gt; to give Victory a lead 2-1 at half. &lt;a href="w%3ABoby%20Despotovski"&gt;Boby Despotovski's&lt;/a&gt; equaliser in the second kept the Glory in the top four.

<h1>Mario Draghi succeeds Antonio Fazio as Bank of Italy governor</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Mario%20Draghi%20succeeds%20Antonio%20Fazio%20as%20Bank%20of%20Italy%20governor&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3AAntonio%20Fazio"&gt;Fazio&lt;/a&gt; has stepped down after an investigation into his role in a controversial bank takeover. &lt;a href="w%3AMario%20Draghi"&gt;Mario Draghi&lt;/a&gt; is to fill his shoes. Draghi's former job was managing director of the investment bank &lt;a href="w%3AGoldman%20Sachs"&gt;Goldman Sachs&lt;/a&gt;. Draghi will serve a six year term under a new law that set term limits for the Central banks governor passed last week.

Draghi, who is 58, has had senior government positions in the past including director general of the Italian treasury. He was born in Rome and earned a doctorate in economics from &lt;a href="w%3AMIT"&gt;MIT&lt;/a&gt; in 1976. After earning his degree he taught at the University of Florence until 1991. During this time Draghi was an Executive Director of the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Bank"&gt;World Bank&lt;/a&gt;. During his tenure as director general of the treasury he carried out extensive privatisation and was appointed chairman of the Italian Committee for Privatisations. Analysts say he has a good reputation but "Draghi has a tough job to restore the &lt;a href="w%3ABanca%20d%27Italia"&gt;Bank of Italy&lt;/a&gt;'s credibility, but he is appreciated internationally and has done a lot of jobs and done them well," said Luigi Speranza, an economist with BNP Paribas.

Lorenzo Codogno, an economist with &lt;a href="w%3ABank%20of%20America"&gt;Bank of America&lt;/a&gt;, looks forward to Draghi's tenure as the governor of the central bank "His appointment should lead to a more open Italian bank market which will, in the end, mean Italians have to pay less for their bank services."

On &lt;a href="w%3ADecember%2015"&gt;December 15&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3A2005"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt;, a computing effort of the Central Missouri State University (CMSU), led by Curtis Cooper and Steven Boone, as part of the &lt;a href="w%3Adistributed%20computing"&gt;distributed computing&lt;/a&gt; project known as the &lt;a href="w%3AGreat%20Internet%20Mersenne%20Prime%20Search"&gt;Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search&lt;/a&gt; (GIMPS), discovered the largest known &lt;a href="w%3Aprime%20number"&gt;prime number&lt;/a&gt;, divisible only by the number 1 and itself: 2-1. 

The discovery, which marks the 43rd known &lt;a href="w%3AMersenne%20prime"&gt;Mersenne prime&lt;/a&gt; and the 9th discovered by GIMPS, was made by running a free downloadable program called &lt;a href="w%3APrime95"&gt;Prime95&lt;/a&gt;. The CMSU team is currently the highest-ranked contributor to GIMPS with over 700 computers running Prime95.

Posters produced and printed by the art project ♡❤♡25peaces♡❤♡, in Austria have caused huge public outcry and debate. The posters depict Britain's Queen Elizabeth, having sexual intercourse with US president George W. Bush, and French President Jacques Chirac. A number of public figures including Wolfgang Schuessel, the Austrian Chancellor, have publicly denounced the posters.

Its creator, artist Carlos Aires, says he had no desire to offend anyone, "♡❤I suddenly had this image of three decision makers who are having an orgy while everything around them collapses♡❤".

Alex Tew, a student in &lt;a href="w%3AEngland"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;, has almost reached his target of one million dollars on his website: &lt;a href="w%3AMillion%20Dollar%20Homepage"&gt;Million Dollar Homepage&lt;/a&gt;. He came up with the idea after jotting down ideas before he went to bed on how to become a &lt;a href="w%3Amillionaire"&gt;millionaire&lt;/a&gt; before he went to &lt;a href="w%3Auniversity"&gt;university&lt;/a&gt;. Then he came up with the million-dollar idea: selling &lt;a href="w%3Apixels"&gt;pixels&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3AUSD"&gt;USD&lt;/a&gt; $1 each on a web page. Alex currently believes he can make his goal by the end of &lt;a href="w%3ADecember%2031"&gt;31st December&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3A2005"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AAdvertising"&gt;Advertising&lt;/a&gt; companies especially appreciate the website, as they wish to "make &lt;a href="w%3AInternet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt; history" on the Million Dollar Homepage. In fact as of writing, he has already made USD $999,000. The student says advertisers get to keep their ads for a period of five years from purchase and he says he will use the money he has made to guarantee it. Alex has said he has already got numerous job offers from companies aiming to secure his money making talent.

Tew is undergoing a &lt;a href="w%3Abusiness%20management"&gt;business management&lt;/a&gt; course at &lt;a href="w%3ANottingham"&gt;Nottingham&lt;/a&gt; and needed &lt;a href="w%3AGBP"&gt;GBP&lt;/a&gt; £7000 a year to complete his studies. He is understandably overwhelmed by the success he has achieved: "It's just nuts. I'm in a state of disbelief. It's like &lt;a href="w%3AMonopoly"&gt;Monopoly&lt;/a&gt; money but then I look at my bank account and there's a lot of cash in it." The &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20National%20Union%20of%20Students"&gt;British National Union of Students&lt;/a&gt; claim that 90% of students are in &lt;a href="w%3Adebt"&gt;debt&lt;/a&gt;. However, what only worries him is how he's going to spend his money. He has already spent some of his money on a car for himself, as he thinks of what to do with his new fortune.

His website's method is simple; his website is made up of one page divided into 10,000 boxes, each 100 pixels in size. Companies can buy one or more boxes for USD $100 each and cover it with a logo, which, when clicked on, transports web users to the customers' own site.
The figures add up with the site now carrying over 240 advertisements and has 30,000 hits a day. Even the actor &lt;a href="w%3AJack%20Black"&gt;Jack Black&lt;/a&gt;, star of "♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASchool%20of%20Rock"&gt;School of Rock&lt;/a&gt;♡❤" and "♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AShallow%20Hal"&gt;Shallow Hal&lt;/a&gt;♡❤", is using the site to advertise his band &lt;a href="w%3ATenacious%20D"&gt;Tenacious D&lt;/a&gt;.

Bolivia's new president-elect &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AEvo%20Morales"&gt;Evo Morales&lt;/a&gt; has branded &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; a "terrorist", and has referred to &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ACondoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; as "Mrs Condolences" in an exclusive interview for Qatar's News Channel &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AAl-Jazeera"&gt;Al-Jazeera&lt;/a&gt;.

Before departing for an official visit to &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ACuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;, Morales denounced what he calls a "dirty war" undertaken by Bush against him and said that "♡❤Bush was the only terrorist because he is the only one who militarily interferes in the domestic affairs of other countries. That's state terrorism, but those who claim their rights are not terrorists♡❤", he reiterated in what has been regarded as an escalation of his anti-&lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AWashington"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; rhetoric.

At the same time, he said in &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AChapare"&gt;Chapare&lt;/a&gt; during the celebration of his victory, that the plan "zero coca" carried out by the US to &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3Acoca%20eradication"&gt;eradicate coca&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ABolivia"&gt;Bolivia&lt;/a&gt; is terminated. "♡❤We are winning the green battle, coca is defeating the American dollar♡❤" he said.

&lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AVenezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AHugo%20Ch%C3%A1vez"&gt;Hugo Chavez&lt;/a&gt; is another head of state who has previously labeled George W. Bush a "terrorist".

The legality of the spying has been questioned.

&lt;a href="w%3A%20James%20Robertson%20%28judge%29"&gt;James Robertson&lt;/a&gt;, a former panel judge member of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Foreign%20Intelligence%20Surveillance%20Court"&gt;Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court&lt;/a&gt;, resigned in protest over the murky question of the constitutionality of the NSA eavesdropping on international telephone calls and e-mail, which bypassed the jurisprudence of that court.

&lt;a href="w%3AFarris%20Hassan"&gt;Farris Hassan&lt;/a&gt;, a 16 year old high school student from &lt;a href="w%3AFlorida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, decided to visit &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; and left for the country on December 11, 2005 alone and without having informed his parents.

After catching a connecting flight in Amsterdam, he arrived in &lt;a href="w%3AKuwait%20City"&gt;Kuwait City&lt;/a&gt; on December 13. He called his parents on the telephone and informed them of where he was and his intention to visit Iraq. This was the first time his parents learned of his plans. He then attempted to cross the Kuwait-Iraq border by taxi, but because of tight security for the upcoming elections he was unable to pass through, and spent a week in &lt;a href="w%3ABeirut"&gt;Beirut&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;, interviewing minority Christians. Then on December 25, he flew in to &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt; International Airport. Relatives picked him up from the airport and put him at a hotel known to frequently house American citizens.

He financed the trip and made all the arrangements himself with money that he had saved up.

The inspiration for his journey was the result of a segment of his English class on 'immersion journalism' at his school, &lt;a href="w%3APine%20Crest%20School"&gt;Pine Crest School&lt;/a&gt;. He was working on an assignment on the war in Iraq and he wished to experience his subject matter first-hand.

Hassan contacted the Associated Press to announce that he was in Iraq to do research and humanitarian work. They were shocked to see an American teenager walking around unaccompanied. They in turn immediately contacted the US Embassy, who had been contacted by his parents and were on the lookout for him. Hassan's parents were born in Iraq, but he does not speak any Arabic, making him easily stand out as a foreigner in Iraq, where kidnappings of Americans and violence are an everyday occurrence. His parents planned to take him to see Iraq once the war was over.

U.S. Consul General Richard Hermann reiterated the U.S. Embassy's strong warning to U.S. citizens against traveling to Iraq as he announced that Hassan was with American troops and was on his way home.

He turned in his assignment via email and is due back home over the New Years Day weekend.

&lt;a href="w%3AAl-Qaeda"&gt;Al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; has released video of &lt;a href="w%3ASudanese"&gt;Sudanese&lt;/a&gt; hostages that members of the organization have kidnapped last week.

The video indicates that the militants intend to kill five kidnapped employees of the Sudanese Embassy in &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt; in two days unless the Sudanese government removes its diplomatic mission from Iraq. Sudan has announced that it will abandon its embassy today, apparently in a bid to free the hostages.

The &lt;a href="w%3AColorado%20College"&gt;Colorado College&lt;/a&gt; Tigers beat the Spartans of &lt;a href="w%3AMichigan%20State%20University"&gt;Michigan State University&lt;/a&gt; in men's ice hockey on Friday, for the title of champions of the 41st annual &lt;a href="w%3AGreat%20Lakes%20Invitational"&gt;Great Lakes Invitational&lt;/a&gt; ice hockey tournament at &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Louis%20Arena"&gt;Joe Louis Arena&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ADetroit%2C%20Michigan"&gt;Detroit&lt;/a&gt;.

The Tigers, the team chosen to be invited into the tournament and appearing for the first time since 1965 in the tournament, led with a 5-0 lead during the second period, after which Michigan State switched goalies. The Spartans put freshmen Jeff Lerg into net, replacing Dominic Vicari, who was earlier given a penalty for his contact with a member of Colorado's team in front of the net. Michigan State junior Tyler Howells scored two goals during the second period, and Colorado student Brett Sterling made the Tiger's final goal for the night.

Colorado College took first place in the invitational, and Michigan State ended in second place, after their previous win over Michigan Tech at a score of 3-2. The Tigers previously beat the University of Michigan on Thursday, at a score of 6-1.

Meanwhile, the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Michigan"&gt;University of Michigan&lt;/a&gt; beat GLI co-sponsor &lt;a href="w%3AMichigan%20Technological%20University"&gt;Michigan Tech University&lt;/a&gt; with a score of 5-3 for a third place finish in the invitational earlier in the day.

With 2 minutes remaining in the &lt;a href="w%3AIce%20hockey%23Periods%20and%20overtime"&gt;third period&lt;/a&gt;, the University of Michigan went one up over Michigan Tech, breaking the 3-3 tie. Michigan Tech pulled their goalie with one minute remaining to gain a man advantage, but the strategy failed and allowed the University of Michigan to get another goal resulting in the final 5-3 score.

The game secured the third place position in the invitational for University of Michigan, and fourth place for Michigan Tech.

&lt;a href="w%3AJ%C3%BCrgen%20Chrobog"&gt;Jürgen Chrobog&lt;/a&gt;, former state secretary in the German Foreign Office, his wife and their three sons have been freed, German foreign minister &lt;a href="w%3AFrank-Walter%20Steinmeier"&gt;Frank-Walter Steinmeier&lt;/a&gt; confirmed at a press conference.

Steinmeier said the family was doing well. They were abducted on Wednesday in the east of the country while being on a tourism trip on the invitation of the Yemeni government. The captors were demanding the release of five tribesmen held by the government. The Yemeni defense minister was apparently the one who was able to negotiate the release.

Monthly donors to the Greenpeace in the UK have received a shock recently, as their specified amounts were multiplied by 100. Thus, a "direct debt donation" of £2 monthly would have come out at £200, and donations of £50 became £5000.

The environmental charity says that they will reimburse donors by January 3, and also pay any extra bank charges incurred.

John Sauven, a director at the NGO said "We are still trying to find out how this glitch happened but for some reason two noughts seem to have been added, or the computer has converted pence into pounds. Our IT specialists are trying to work it out and rectify it to make sure it doesn't happen again. The only people who will be out of pocket are us."

One supporter told The Herald that she'd no longer let Greenpeace access her bank account. 

Over 221,000 Brits support the organization; the number of those affected was unknown.

Millions of people celebrated the arrival of the new year as the clock struck midnight on December 31, 2005, throughout the world's time zones.

<h3>Sydney</h3>
&lt;a href="w%3ASydney%2C%20Australia"&gt;Sydney, Australia&lt;/a&gt; led the way with red lights on the &lt;a href="w%3ASydney%20Harbour%20Bridge"&gt;Harbour Bridge&lt;/a&gt; and over 80,000 fireworks over the water. Over 1.2 million people were reported to have attended this celebration, making it one of the largest in the world.

<h3>New York City</h3>
Hundreds of thousands of people gathered in &lt;a href="w%3ATimes%20Square"&gt;Times Square&lt;/a&gt; to see the historic lowering of the &lt;a href="w%3Awaterford%20crystal"&gt;Waterford crystal&lt;/a&gt; ball, a tradition began in 1906.

<h3>London</h3>
London celebrated the New Year at midnight GMT with a ten minute firework display featuring fireworks launched by and from the London Eye observation wheel. The countdown to midnight was marked by a laser lightshow and with photos of olympic heroes projected onto a nearby building. An estimated 200,000 people watched the firework display, up on the previous year, despite a tube strike which closed many Underground stations.

<h3>Toronto</h3>
Among other notable celebrations across the world was Toronto, which celebrated the new year in Nathan Philips Square. It is the first time the annual event was broadcast to all of Canada.

The Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2005 that amends &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20nationality%20law"&gt;New Zealands nationality law&lt;/a&gt; comes into effect today.

As of today babies will only acquire &lt;a href="w%3Acitizenship"&gt;citizenship&lt;/a&gt; at birth if at least one of their parents is a citizen in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; or its dependencies. Babies born to parents who are in New Zealand or its dependencies on holiday will no longer become citizens, as was the case until the end of 2005.

The &lt;a href="http%3A//www.citizenship.govt.nz"&gt;Department of Internal Affairs website&lt;/a&gt; says the changes have been brought in to ensure the benefits of New Zealand citizenship only go to those with a genuine and on-going link to the country.

A massive bushfire that was threatening West &lt;a href="w%3AVictoria"&gt;Victorian&lt;/a&gt; towns of Great Western, Armstrong, Moyston, Pomonal, Halls Gap and Ararat has stopped spreading due to heavy rainfall giving firefighters their first relief in two days. Meanwhile, two major fires have broken out on the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; Central Coast, North of &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; with another in Sydney.

The Victorian fire has destroyed 5 homes in the Stawell and two people have been injured when they fell down a mineshaft while fighting the blaze. Reports claim that the fire front was up to 30Km in length. Earlier today the fire was burning out of control, being fanned by strong winds. This afternoon a weather change came, dumping heavy rain over the region.

Five major fires have been reported on the NSW Central coast in the Woy Woy and Mount White regions. 50 homes are believed to be under direct threat. Residents in affected parts of Woy Woy, Umina and Pearl beaches, and Patonga, have been taken to makeshift evacuation centres at the Gosford Leagues Club and Woy Woy Bowling Club.

The &lt;a href="w%3ASydney-Newcastle%20Freeway"&gt;Sydney Newcastle (F3 freeway)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Highway"&gt;Pacific Highway&lt;/a&gt; have been closed. Motorists which had been standed on the southbound carriageway of the F3 freeway were allowed through at around 6PM AEDT following fears of a wind change which could have put them in danger of the fire. Police say that the backlog was let through and the freeway remains closed.

Intercity train services North of Sydney have also been affected with the railway line closed at Berowra.

Dozens of fire crews and four water bombing aircraft were battling the blazes, according to bushfire volunteer Michael Wood, with changeable wind conditions starting spot fires nearby. Strong north-westerly wind gusts and temperatures of up to 44 degrees posed extremely dangerous fire conditions, the Rural Fire Service said.

The Woy Woy fire front was expected to make a run to Umina and Pearl Beach in the coming hours. 300 firefighters are working to contain the flames.

Cameron Wade, a spokesman for the NSW Rural Fire Service said firefighters were battling flames up to 30 metres in height, destroying several homes. A Fire Station near Woy Woy was also destroyed along with several fire trucks and volunteers cars.

Mr Wade also said that crews were being called in from Sydney and the &lt;a href="w%3AHunter%20Valley"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt; to assist local fire crews. Six aircraft and a sky crane are also being used.

It is believed that winds in the Central Coast region are gusting at up to 60 km/h.

Another fire in the Sydney suburb of Belrose is expected to cause problems in the next few hours.

In Merimbula, on the NSW far south coast residents are being evacuated, after a fire broke containment lines.

Phill Koperberg, Commissioner of the NSW Rural Fire Service said there were fires concern at Junee and Cootamundra in southern NSW and at Appin and Bulli south of Sydney.

According to an RFS spokesman, a house in Junee was destoyed and a farmer was hospitalised after receiving burns to 60 percent of his body. A total of five homes in the Junee area have been confirmed lost.

About 100 people have been evacuated from Junee's outskirts amid fears that southerly winds could reach 100 kph, drastically worsening the fire situation.

Three homes on the Central Coast and three in Junee have been lost.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Tropical%20Storm%20Zeta%20becomes%20second%20cross-season%20tropical%20storm%20in%20history&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Tropical Storm Zeta has become the first storm of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season"&gt;2006 Atlantic hurricane season&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; after crossing over from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2005%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season"&gt;2005 Atlantic hurricane season&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as that seasons 27th storm, breaking the record set by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Epsilon"&gt;Hurricane Epsilon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; earlier in December. This makes Zeta the second tropical storm in history to cross over into another season; the first time this occurred was in 1954-55 with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Alice"&gt;Hurricane Alice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Zeta currently has a top sustained wind speed of 50mph (85 km/h). It is currently about 1,085 miles (1745 km) southwest of the Azores and is proceeding west-southwest at 2mph (4 km/h). Forecasters say it is not expected to become a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ahurricane"&gt;hurricane&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; or threaten land.

Zeta formed on December 30, 2005, after the official end of the destructive and record-breaking 2005 Atlantic hurricane season, which ended on November 30, 2005. The 2005 season was notable for the record number of storms it produced (including Zeta), and was the first time storm names used &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AV"&gt;V&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AW"&gt;W&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGreek%20letters"&gt;Greek letters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the second time the letters &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AR"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AS"&gt;S&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AT"&gt;T&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; were used. The season also had the highest-ever number of storms forming in the month of July, and had the highest number of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACategory%205%20hurricanes"&gt;Category 5 hurricanes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with a total of three, including &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Wilma"&gt;Hurricane Wilma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the most intense hurricane ever in the Atlantic basin.

The most notable of the three Category 5 hurricanes was &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Katrina caused over $100 billion (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUSD"&gt;USD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) in damage and 1,383 deaths, especially along &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMississippi"&gt;Mississippi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAlabama"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; coastlines which suffered catastrophic damage. The storm also caused levees to break in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Orleans"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; leading to the flooding of the city which is located below sea-level. The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20government"&gt;United States government&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the city government of New Orleans, and the government of the State of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALouisiana"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; were all &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACriticism%20of%20government%20response%20to%20Hurricane%20Katrina"&gt;severely criticized&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for their handling of the storms aftermath. Hurricane Katrina, although not yet certified, is most likely the costliest hurricane in U.S. history. 

Forecasters are predicting that hurricane seasons are going to be more active than usual for about another decade.

<h1>Russia cuts off gas supplies to Ukraine</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Russia%20cuts%20off%20gas%20supplies%20to%20Ukraine&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; has ended exports of &lt;a href="w%3Anatural%20gas"&gt;natural gas&lt;/a&gt; to neighbouring &lt;a href="Ukraine"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; following a failure to reach a compromise over prices. &lt;a href="w%3AGazprom"&gt;Gazprom&lt;/a&gt;, Russia's natural gas behemoth, began cutting off supplies at 7:00 a.m. UTC Sunday, January 1. 

Gazprom claims to have taken this action because Ukraine refuses to pay the market rate for natural gas which is approximately four times higher than the price previously agreed upon by the two. Ukraine has stated that they are not averse to higher prices but believe they ought to be introduced sequentially. Additionally, Russia does not want to honor its contract to supply gas at $50 per 1000 cubic meters until 2008. By comparison, gas produced by OPEC costs $11.4 per 1000 cubic feet (December 28, 2005)&lt;a href="http%3A//www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5612507/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, equivalent to $402.6 per 1000 cubic meters, an 8-fold rebate.

Gazprom spokesman Sergei Kupriyanov said enough gas was still being piped via Ukraine to maintain deliveries to other countries, and if they were not getting all their gas, it meant Ukraine was tapping into it. Eighty percent of Russian gas exports to Western Europe pass through Ukraine. 

"We have information from the ground that shows Ukraine has started illegally siphoning off Russian gas destined for European consumers," Kupriyanov said. 

Ukraine is of the position that since Russia will not live up to the agreement to sell at $50 per 1000 cubic meters until 2008, Ukraine as a transiting country, has the right to offset the illegal cost increase with seizure of Russian assets - namely the gas going through the pipelines in Ukraine.

Sergei Kupriyanov, press secretary to Gazprom's chief executive, said "Negotiations reach a deadlock when it comes to discussing actual figures ... They have called on us to use price parameters that probably existed in the late 1990s in 2006, which is impossible ... The price of gas and other energy resources has risen considerably over the past few years."

The dispute is also tied to the political situation between the two countries. Although a private business, the largest individual shareholder in Gazprom is the Russian government which owns slightly less than 40%. The dispute was further politicized by the personal intervention of &lt;a href="w%3AVladimir%20Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; who offered Ukraine the chance to delay paying market prices for a further three months. Critics of the current Russian government have argued that Gazprom's action has been an attempt to punish Ukraine for forging closer links with the West following the &lt;a href="w%3AOrange%20Revolution"&gt;Orange Revolution&lt;/a&gt;. Putin's advocates, however, have argued that the status quo is akin to a budgetary transfer between the two governments and costs Russia about US$4.5 billion per year. 
Special European commission has already counted gas independently,and confirmed its loss. But Ukraine disagrees,saing,that it is unjust.German Kanzler Angela Merkel hopes,that the conflict will end soon. 
And a recent poll conducted by &lt;a href="w%3AVCIOM"&gt;VTSIOM&lt;/a&gt; suggests that 80% of Russian citizens support the move by Gazprom. Ukraine has threatened to retaliate by raising the rent that Russia's navy pays to use the Ukrainian port of Sevastopol as headquarters for its Black Sea fleet, and refusing to repair Russian rockets, which can be repaired only there.

Wildfires are burning homes in &lt;a href="w%3AOklahoma%20City%2C%20Oklahoma"&gt;Oklahoma City&lt;/a&gt;. Winds in excess of 40 mph have grounded helicopters and tanker planes, the high winds are also driving the fires. Firefighters have ordered an evacuation of several neighborhoods. At least three homes have burned. 200 homes have been evacuated. The area has had only a quarter-inch of rain since October with no relief in sight.

The &lt;a href="w%3APittsburgh%20Steelers"&gt;Pittsbugh Steelers&lt;/a&gt; defeated the &lt;a href="w%3ADetroit%20Lions"&gt;Detroit Lions&lt;/a&gt; 35-21 at &lt;a href="w%3AHeinz%20Field"&gt;Heinz Field&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3APittsburgh%2C%20Pennsylvania"&gt;Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt;. The victory earns the Steelers the final spot for an &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Football%20Conference"&gt;AFC&lt;/a&gt; team in the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Football%20League"&gt;NFL&lt;/a&gt; playoffs.

The Steelers, who had a 10-5 record heading into the game, were strong favorites against the Lions, who were 5-10. Pittsburgh took an early lead on an 81 yard Antwaan Randle El punt return less than two minutes into the game. However, the Lions fought back, with quarterback &lt;a href="w%3AJoey%20Harrington"&gt;Joey Harrington&lt;/a&gt; throwing scoring passes on two consecutive drives in the first quarter to put Detroit up 14-7.

Veteran Steelers running back &lt;a href="w%3AJerome%20Bettis"&gt;Jerome Bettis&lt;/a&gt; scored the next three touchdowns, matching a career high. His third touchdown resulted in a standing ovation from the crowd of 63,794. This will likely be the last home game for Bettis, as he is expected to retire at the end of this season.

The Steelers (11-5) go on to play the &lt;a href="w%3ACincinnati%20Bengals"&gt;Bengals&lt;/a&gt; (11-5) in Cincinnati next Sunday at 4:00pm in the wildcard round. The Steelers split their season series with the Bengals winning 27-13 on October 23 in Cincinnati, but losing 38-31 at home on December 4.

"We play [the Bengals] twice a year and we know them," said Steelers receiver &lt;a href="w%3AHines%20Ward"&gt;Hines Ward&lt;/a&gt;. "It's not going to be easy, but we're more comfortable with them."

The other AFC wildcard game has the &lt;a href="w%3AJacksonville%20Jaguars"&gt;Jacksonville Jaguars&lt;/a&gt; (12-4) visiting the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20England%20Patroits"&gt;New England Patroits&lt;/a&gt; (10-6). The winners of the wild card round will face the &lt;a href="w%3AIndianapolis%20Colts"&gt;Indianapolis Colts&lt;/a&gt; (14-2) or the &lt;a href="w%3ADenver%20Broncos"&gt;Denver Broncos&lt;/a&gt; (13-3) in the divisonal round.

In San Luis de La Balsa, Costa Rica a tourist bus carrying foreign tourist flipped over in the highway about 55 miles Northeast of the capital of San Jose. At least a dozen people were injured. One man, Dan McHugh, is a Canadian who is among the people hurt.

McHugh says that the roads were slick which caused the bus to slide into a ditch and roll onto its side. He says that he was only cut by shattered glass while other passengers were pinned under the bus.

The nationalities of the other passengers is not immediately known, though McHugh said that there were Australians on the bus and the U.S. Embassy confirmed that there were citizens of the United States also.

One woman with serious injuries was air-lifted to a hospital in San Jose while others were taken to local hospitals in nearby towns.

&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand's&lt;/a&gt; warm sunny New Year's weather has come to a sudden end as gale force winds and rain assault southern New Zealand.

In parts of the &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Island"&gt;South Island&lt;/a&gt; New Year campers have finished their holiday early as winds averaging 120km/h (75 m/h), gusting at times up to 180km/h (112 m/h), have blown in.

Power went out to 1300 homes in the capital city &lt;a href="w%3AWellington"&gt;Wellington&lt;/a&gt;; flights were grounded at the airport, with incoming flights diverted to &lt;a href="w%3APalmerston%20North"&gt;Palmerston North&lt;/a&gt; airport. 

“The &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Island"&gt;North Island&lt;/a&gt; will also be affected by the low,” says &lt;a href="w%3AMetService"&gt;MetService&lt;/a&gt; forecaster Michael Short, “with heavy rain around the &lt;a href="w%3ATararua%20Ranges"&gt;Tararua Ranges&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMt%20Taranaki"&gt;Mt Taranaki&lt;/a&gt;.”

The MetService has issued severe weather warnings for most of the South Island and the southern portion of the North Island; bad weather is also forecasted throughout the rest of the country. 

The MetService says to expect bad weather for the next 10 days as a deepening low moves south of Stewart Island, but a flow of westerly winds is expected to stay put all week.

Holiday makers have been asked by MetService to review their holiday plans and keep up to date with the latest weather.

A 17-year-old girl was reportedly raped and murdered in &lt;a href="Ciudad%20Ju%C3%A1rez"&gt;Ciudad Juárez&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Mexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;'s fifth largest city, on Christmas Eve, and now 3 have been arrested in the incident. According to spokeswoman Claudia Elena Banuelos of the &lt;a href="Chihuahua"&gt;Chihuahua&lt;/a&gt; Attorney General's office, the 3 men were drinking with the victim when one proposed having sex with her. When the victim refused the sex, the attackers raped her, according to the spokeswoman. One of the attackers then allegedly hit her in the head with a blunt object several times, and ran away when he saw she was unconscious. The 3 attackers were identified as Mario Loya Aguirre, Eleazar Pena Navarro and Jorge Armando Sifuentes Martinez. 

This was the 32nd murder of a woman in Ciudad Juárez in 2005 &amp;mdash; police have reportedly solved 26 of these murders.

More than 350 women have been murdered in Juárez since 1993, according to federal investigators. A report from &lt;a href="Amnesty%20International"&gt;Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt; indicates that as many as 400 women may be missing. At least a third of these killings followed a similar pattern in that young women were assaulted, strangled, and dumped in the desert. Police incompetence, cover-ups, and even involvement in the murders have been alleged over the years.

The &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20Redskins"&gt;Washington Redskins&lt;/a&gt; defeated the &lt;a href="w%3APhiladelphia%20Eagles"&gt;Philadelphia Eagles&lt;/a&gt; 31-20 at &lt;a href="w%3ALincoln%20Financial%20Field"&gt;Lincoln Financial Field&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3APhiladelphia%2C%20Pennsylvania"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;. With the win, the Redskins advance to the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Football%20League"&gt;NFL&lt;/a&gt; playoffs for the first time in six years.

The Redskins pulled ahead in the first quarter, but the Eagles answered with &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20McMahon"&gt;Mike McMahon&lt;/a&gt; throwing two touchdowns to rookie wide receiver &lt;a href="w%3AReggie%20Brown"&gt;Reggie Brown&lt;/a&gt;.

Washington evened the score at 17 on the opening drive of the third quarter, thanks to a 54-yard pass to wide receivcer &lt;a href="w%3ASantana%20Moss"&gt;Santana Moss&lt;/a&gt; and a 6-yard running play by running back &lt;a href="w%3AClinton%20Portis"&gt;Clinton Portis&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Akers"&gt;David Akers&lt;/a&gt; put the Eagles in the lead again with a 35-yard field goal on the next drive.

McMahon then made a crucial mistake, when a bad pass was intercepted by line backer &lt;a href="w%3ALemar%20Mashall"&gt;Lemar Mashall&lt;/a&gt; at the Philadelphia 22 yard line. Portis ran the ball up the sidelines on the next play for his second touchdown of the game, putting Washington ahead 24-20. Free safety &lt;a href="w%3ASean%20Taylor"&gt;Sean Taylor&lt;/a&gt; clinched the victory for the Redskins with a 39-yard fumble return.

Portis ran for a total of 112 yards in the game and set a franchise rushing record of 1,432 yards. This is the fifth win in a row for the Redskins, who finish the regular season with a 10-6 record.

"Looking back to 5-6, we talked at that time that if we lost another game we'd be out," said Washington head coach &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Gibbs"&gt;Joe Gibbs&lt;/a&gt;. "Trying to win five straight is a tough deal, but our guys seemed to understand what it would take. We went back to the basics."

The Redskins go on to play the &lt;a href="w%3ATampa%20Bay%20Buccaneers"&gt;Buccaneers&lt;/a&gt; (11-5) in Tampa Bay next Saturday at 4:30pm in the wildcard round. The other &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Football%20Conference"&gt;NFC&lt;/a&gt; wild game has the &lt;a href="w%3ACarolina%20Panthers"&gt;Carolina Panthers&lt;/a&gt; (11-5) visiting the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Giants"&gt;New York Giants&lt;/a&gt; (11-5). The winners of the wild card round will face the &lt;a href="w%3ASeattle%20Seahawks"&gt;Seattle Seahawks&lt;/a&gt; (13-3) or the &lt;a href="w%3AChicago%20Bears"&gt;Chicago Bears&lt;/a&gt; (11-5) in the divisional round.

Firefighters in the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; state of &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; continue to battle bushfires across the state.

Rural Fire Service Commissioner Phill Koperberg said that there are still three fires on the Central Coast, while another fire in Junee is moving north and is now spread over 35,000 hectares.

He added that it could take up to four days to contain the fires due to rain and strong winds. A southerly change blew through the state last night, easing temperatures and reducing the fire threat. No homes are believed to be under direct threat at this time.

It is feared that the weather which helped the fires take hold may return on the weekend.

Fires on the Central Coast fires continue to affect road and rail transport between Sydney and Newcastle.

The Sydney-Newcastle Freeway and the Pacific Highway have been reopened, although there is heavy traffic on the freeway at Brooklyn and Cowan. Drivers have been advised to exercise caution due to thick smoke. Trains travelling between the Central Coast and Newcastle to Sydney are heavily delayed.

Only one person has been killed by the fires, a 65 year old man who suffered a heart attack while helping residents evacuate on the Central Coast.

27 fires are reported to be burning across New South Wales.

<h1>Row over Australian flag at Bondi Pavilion</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Row%20over%20Australian%20flag%20at%20Bondi%20Pavilion&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

New South Wales Premier &lt;a href="w%3AMorris%20Iemma"&gt;Morris Iemma&lt;/a&gt; has prompted controversy following recent race-riots, when he urged the &lt;a href="w%3AWaverley%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Waverley Council&lt;/a&gt; to reconsider its decision not to fly the Australian flag over The &lt;a href="w%3ABondi%20Beach%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Bondi&lt;/a&gt; (Beach) Pavilion Community Cultural Centre.

"There is no problem with the flag and as for council banning the flag, it's absolute nonsense," responded Waverley deputy mayor George Newhouse. He said that the Premier, who described the council's decision as divisive and disgraceful, did not understand the facts.

"We already fly the flag at Bondi, we proudly fly the flag at Bondi and this decision has absolutely nothing to do with racism or Cronulla. It has everything to do with practical common sense," Mr Newhouse said. 

"The Pavilion is a heritage-listed building and it will cost thousands of dollars to perform a heritage study and then erect the poles, which don't exist. We already have the flag, we love the flag, there is no problem with the flag and as for council banning the flag, it's absolute nonsense," said Mr Newhouse.

Riots took place in December at Cronulla, another Sydney beach, with many of the proponents and commentators blaming inter-ethnic tensions for the outbreak.

Premier Iemma last week presented a new flag to the Brighton-le-Sands RSL Club after its symbol was burnt during the December 11 riots.

Of the Waverly Council decision, Premier Iemma said, "Our flag is a symbol of national unity and the council decision is just ridiculous. They want to reconsider it immediately."

The Council first voted against installing the flag in March 2005 because of a lengthy and expensive permit process. It is the second time in a year the council has rejected the motion. Mayor of Waverley, Mora Main, says there are already number of Australian flags flying in the Bondi Beach area. She said their primary concern was cost - not just $150 for each flagpole, but more than $15,000 because of the need to do a heritage study and consult the community. 

"It's an iconic heritage building. Anything that's done to the pavilion needs to go through a rigorous heritage process," Cr Main said. 

Before imposing the ban, the Council recently rejected an offer from Federal MP &lt;a href="w%3AMalcolm%20Turnbull"&gt;Malcolm Turnbull&lt;/a&gt; to pay for an Australian and Aboriginal flag. 

However, Mayor Mora Main says the Council would now have a rethink. 

"I have called on the Premier and Mr Turnbull to meet with me to discuss the appropriateness of putting flags on the pavilion and also how it can be funded," she said. "It's great to hear this discussion about the flags and I look forward to hearing everyone's ideas when we consult with the community."

<h1>Microsoft Windows metafiles are a vector for computer viruses</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Microsoft%20Windows%20metafiles%20are%20a%20vector%20for%20computer%20viruses&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3AWindows%20Metafile"&gt;Microsoft Windows metafiles&lt;/a&gt; have been discovered to be a vector for computer viruses, as they are treated as image files, but can execute machine code. Windows metafiles often use the extension .wmf files, but they may also execute if their extension is .jpeg, .png or any other common image extension.
This vulnerability affects any Windows software which displays images, including instant messenger software, email clients, and web browsers. Firefox reduces the vulnerability by asking a user before executing Windows metafiles, but metafiles masquerading as another format will still be executed automatically by the operating system.

Microsoft has not yet issued a patch for the vulnerability, prompting &lt;a href="w%3AIlfak%20Guilfanov"&gt;Ilfak Guilfanov&lt;/a&gt; to release an &lt;a href="http%3A//www.hexblog.com/2005/12/wmf_vuln.html%23more"&gt;unofficial patch&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft's security advisory recommends unregistering shimgvw.dll to disable handling of Windows MetaFiles. Critics point out that shimgvw.dll could become re-registered by malicious processes or other installations. They also suggest that malicious Windows Metafiles could merely remain "dormant" until shimgvw.dll is re-registered.

The exploit has been used to attack online forums which allow embedding of image files via &amp;lt;img&amp;gt; tags, prompting some gaming forums to disable &amp;lt;img&amp;gt; tags &lt;a href="http%3A//www.ga-forum.com/announcement.php%3Ff%3D2%26amp%3Bannouncementid%3D23"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Any site accepting image media upload, such as &lt;a href="w%3Aavatar%20%28virtual%20reality%29"&gt;avatars&lt;/a&gt;, will also be vulnerable if this site accepts .wmf files, possibly masquerading as another media file format. 

The exploit has also been used by an instant messaging worm, which appears to provide a backdoor for later exploitation via an &lt;a href="w%3AIRC%20bot"&gt;IRC bot&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http%3A//www.viruslist.com/en/weblog%3Fdiscuss%3D176892530%26amp%3Breturn%3D1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3AMcAfee"&gt;McAfee&lt;/a&gt; antivirus company said the WMF vulnerability is being exploited to drop over 30 variants of the &lt;a href="w%3ABifrose%20%28trojan%20horse%29"&gt;Bifrose&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Abackdoor"&gt;backdoor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Atrojan%20horse%20%28computing%29"&gt;trojan horse&lt;/a&gt;, and exploitation by other &lt;a href="w%3Amalware"&gt;malware&lt;/a&gt; is likely. McAfee estimates the first generation of such exploits had infected more than 6% of their customer base by 31 December 2005. 

"The WMF vulnerability probably affects more computers than any other security vulnerability, ever," said Mikko of F-Secure. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/archive-012006.html%2300000761"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

So more staff can be hired for &lt;a href="w%3ABolivia"&gt;Bolivia's&lt;/a&gt; education, health and social programs, President Elect &lt;a href="w%3AEvo%20Morales"&gt;Evo Morales&lt;/a&gt; announced that he and his cabinet will take a 50% pay cut. The 46-year-old leader slashed his future salary of about $3600 a month to $1800.

Raising Bolivia from its situation as one of the poorest countries in the world is a primary intention of the president elect. "It's a question of sharing the country's situation among us all." said Morales. "This is a democratic revolution and we will answer the Bolivian people's call."

Cabinet ministers and all 157 members of Morales' party that were elected to Congress will also take a 50% pay cut, Morales said. The salaries of 157 substitute congressmen will be eliminated.

Morales, who is known across the country as "Evo", is Bolivia's first native Indian president. Growing up in poverty has marked his politics. He often says, "For a handful of people there is money, for the others, repression." Evo will soon move from his rented single room of a shared house to Bolivia's presidential palace.

Morales also met with business and civic leaders on Tuesday in a conciliatory meeting. Morales said his government would create a stable legal and economic environment to attract investment and create jobs which was applauded by the Bolivian elite.

"I do not have a professional education, but it is important that we co-operate. You have the professional capacity, I have the social consciousness".

At approximately 6-6:30 am &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20American%20Eastern%20Standard%20Time%20Zone"&gt;EST&lt;/a&gt;, the Sago coal mine, near &lt;a href="w%3ABuckhannon%2C%20West%20Virginia"&gt;Buckhannon&lt;/a&gt;, experienced an explosion.

6 miners escaped shortly after the explosion, but 13 miners are still trapped in the mine, almost one mile underground, where methane gas is accumulating, making rescue efforts difficult.

Nearby homes have been evacuated due to the high levels of methane gas, and fans are being used to help disperse the gas.

At this time it is unclear what has caused this explosion.

The mine is owned by &lt;a href="http%3A//www.intlcoal.com/"&gt;International Coal Group Inc.&lt;/a&gt;

Following 8 months of deliberations,a Switzerland court has decided to extradite Evgeny Adamov to Russia, rather than the United States, where he will face corruption charges. The US warrant for the arrest accused Adamov, a former nuclear energy minister, of diverting $9 million slated to improve Russia's nuclear security to private projects in the US and Russia. He was arrested while visiting Switzerland to help his daughter who had had her bank account frozen.

Mikhail Kamynin, a spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, said "We are plased with the Federal Court's decision, although we are talking about an independent court. Therefore, we assume that all the formalities will be fulfilled in the shortest time ."

Adamov has defended himself, admitting that he put US money into his private accounts, but claiming that this was common practice in Russia and was necessary to shield the money from hyperinflation and instability in the banking system.

An amendment of the US Fair Trade Agreement insisted by the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;opposition&lt;/a&gt; may be dropped after lobbying by the US Pharmaceutical Industry.

Mark Latham, former opposition leader negotiated the "evergreening" amendment to ensure that drug companies could not extend patents to fight off cheaper generic versions of their medicines. Companies caught doing so may receive multi-million dollar fines. The US Pharmaceutical Industry claims that the provisions are harming investment.

Acting Prime Minister, Mark Vaile said "We will have a look at it, if (the evergreening issue) is raised by the Americans".

"(But) the US will have to prove that Labor's evergreening amendment is commercially detrimental, not just philosophically detrimental."

A Health Department secretary will travel to Washington on January 13 to discuss the issue before a formal review of the FTA in March.

For several weeks, a group of local residents has kept Francesca's Café on 34 &lt;a href="w%3ABroadway%20Market"&gt;Broadway Market&lt;/a&gt;, Hackney, East &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; occupied day and night to prevent its demolition and conversion into luxury flats by property developer Dr Roger Wratten.

The occupation was evicted on 21st December by police and bailiffs, and workmen began a partial demolition, but a new group of supporters re-occupied the building on 26th December and have begun rebuilding it including new walls and a replacement roof.

The café was bought by Dr. Wratten from &lt;a href="w%3AHackney"&gt;Hackney&lt;/a&gt; Council as part of a number of sales in the street, now surrounded by controversy, and was run by Tony Platia who had worked there for over 30 years. Hundreds of people have attended the café in the past few weeks to show support.

President &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AAlvaro%20Uribe"&gt;Alvaro Uribe&lt;/a&gt; signed, on December 30, 2005, a law that ratifies a &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AFTA"&gt;FTA&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AMercosur"&gt;Mercosur&lt;/a&gt; and gives &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AColombia"&gt;Colombian&lt;/a&gt; products preferential access to a market of 230 million people. Colombian entrepreneurs will also be able to import materials and capital goods from Mercosur at lower costs due to reduced tariffs resulting from the agreement.

The agreement’s asymmetry clauses favor Colombia because it allows the gradual and progressive reduction of tariffs and likewise gives Colombia the opportunity to gradually reform its production system to adapt it to the requirements of future negotiations within the scheme of Mercosur and the &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ASouth%20American%20Community%20of%20Nations"&gt;South American Community of Nations&lt;/a&gt;

This agreement along with previous treaties signed with the &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AAndean%20Community"&gt;Andean Community&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AMexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AChile"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt; and the FTA with the &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; currently under negotiation, highlight the geographic position of Colombia as a center for investment.

<h1>OCTranspo's &quot;new year&quot; of efficiencies?</h1>

Anyone riding the &lt;a href="w%3AOC%20Transpo"&gt;OC Transpo&lt;/a&gt; Ottawa municipal bus service's express bus routes this morning and this afternoon, in the &lt;a href="w%3AOttawa"&gt;Ottawa&lt;/a&gt; area, was probably greeted with an empty bus, and inherently, a "fast and efficient" ride. This is in part because most government workers where off from work still celebrating their Christmas holidays and buses were operating on a "holiday schedule;" a lack of planning on behalf of OC Transpo.

Though, according to OC Transpo, the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.octranspo.com/Xmas/xmas_calendar_menuE.htm"&gt;"Holiday Schedule"&lt;/a&gt; means buses this week shall be running a little less often, in reality there isn't that much difference than the regular schedule. To be more precise, from 05h48 until 07h20, on the express 27 route there will be 5 less buses during the "Holiday Schedule" compared to the "Regular Schedule." 

"This is probably going to be fine for the rest of this week, when government employees start coming back to work", said Yves Roy, an OC Transpo driver, "but today was a holiday and it appears that express routes only had an average of about 2 to 4 passengers." 

"On my ride in to work, at around 6:10 a.m. this morning, nobody else got on the bus. It was like having a personal stretch limo to myself," said Patrick Roy, a guard for the commissionaires. Also, at around 4:15 p.m. another OC Transpo bus driver, whom wished to remain anonymous, stated, "You are the first person I picked up today." He had been working since the morning doing express runs. He then added, "This is a waste of tax payers money." 

&lt;a href="http%3A//www.lightrailnow.org/myths/m_otw001.htm"&gt;Ottawa's BRT "Transitway,"&lt;/a&gt; has indicated that it cost approximately 42.58$ CAN per hour to run a diesel bus. It is estimated that 729 express buses ran today for approximatelly 7 hours costing approximatelly 217,287$ CAN. The cost of operating OC Transpo is split between transit fares collected and the tax base (mostly municipal, with some federal and provincial contributions.)

"We then continued to talk about waste of fuel, employee pay, insurance liability issues and even went into details about such hot political items as the &lt;a href="w%3AKyoto%20Agreement"&gt;Kyoto Agreement&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aconservatism"&gt;conservatism&lt;/a&gt;," said Patrick. "Once the driver reached &lt;a href="w%3APlace%20d%27Orleans"&gt;Place d'Orleans&lt;/a&gt; the second passenger joined in the conversation. The driver then took a faster alternate route and dropped us off not far from our homes."

According to Peter Dickson, editor at &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Ottawa%20Citizen"&gt;The Ottawa Citizen&lt;/a&gt;, last year OC Transpo buses followed a 'reduced' Sunday schedule and this created havoc on the system. Peter asked, if "perhaps this year they where trying to compensate for this inefficiency?" 

Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU), OC Transpo's union representative has indicated, "At current fleet levels, Ottawa's roads would be choked with about 40,000 more cars each rush hour if not for OC Transpo."&lt;a href="http%3A//www.atu588.com/members/misc_ms.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ATU suggests 70 per cent of trips in Ottawa are now made by car. However, seemingly, due to returning vacationers and other reasons, today may have created an increase in the use of cars and influenced this statistic. According to city councillor Clive Doucet's web page "Currently, 17% of all trips residents make in Ottawa are on public transit, up from 15% in the mid-nineties. As a comparison, Paris’ modal split is 40% or higher taking public transit while Los Angeles’ modal split is around 2% for public transit." Analysing ridership on a large scale seems to be an important element for the city.

According to Ottawa Mayor Bob Chiarelli, "We used to be able to plan a transit system for up to 12 years ahead, with assured funding." This of course is in reference to provincial government funding.
"It would make me happier if we took all of the (fuel taxes) and put them into the transportation infrastructure," Mr. Hunt, president of the Canadian Automobile Association says. "But we don't have a plan." 

"Usually OC Transpo bus drivers have two 4 months bookings, for the fall and the winter and two 2 months booking for the spring and for the summer," said Yves Roy. "For the first time in March 2005, there was a special 1 week booking for the March break that rearranged and redistributed drivers of certain high school bus runs. During previous march breaks, drivers would show up usually waiting 30 or more minutes in an "idling" bus." 

Is there such thing as to much efficiency? Today is an example of buses and drivers being very efficient. On the other hand, it may be a lack of efficiency within OC Transpo's booking department, upper management and the governments.

13 American coal miners were trapped 2 miles (3 kilometers) inside the Sago coal mine in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; state of &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Virginia"&gt;West Virginia&lt;/a&gt;. They were trapped since 6:40 am Eastern, Monday, January 2 following a methane gas explosion which caused the shaft to collapse. Rescue operations have commenced and at last report they were 1,400 feet from the location of the miners.

Two activists convicted for painting the words "NO WAR" in five-metre-high red letters on the highest sail of &lt;a href="w%3ASydney%20Opera%20House"&gt;Sydney Opera House&lt;/a&gt; in March 2003, are facing court action again to prevent them from auctioning the equipment used to paint the controversial sign. 

Dr Will Saunders and David Burgess were sentenced to nine months periodic detention and ordered to pay the Opera House Trust $151,000 for malicious damage to the building on March 18, 2003.

The pair spent six months in jail for painting the slogan on one of the sails of the Opera House on the eve of the &lt;a href="w%3A2003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq"&gt;invasion of Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. The protesters say they wish to auction the equipment for humanitarian causes in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;.

Police confiscated the paint can and two brushes used in the incident and have now applied for a court order to have the can and brushes destroyed. They are saying such an auction would contravene proceeds of crime laws.

Saunders said they wanted to auction the can and send the proceeds to humanitarian causes in Iraq. According to The Australian newspaper, Mr Saunders said the auction could be conducted by a registered charity to raise money for the Mother and Child Hospital in Basra. 

He said the can should also be preserved as an important piece of Sydney history. 

"We want to give the surplus money that we've raised, and anything extra we can make from an auction – not only the paint pot ... I think we can raise many many thousands of dollars," he said. "We'd be happy to come to any reasonable arrangement with the police about how this auction takes place ... it's just mean beyond belief, petty-minded just to destroy it."

The matter will go before a Sydney court on January 16. 

Meanwhile, the world-famous Sydney Opera House is one of 21 international landmarks short-listed to become the new Seven Wonders of the World. The list includes modern landmarks such as Paris' Eiffel Tower and older candidates like the Colosseum in Rome and China's Great Wall.

Three miners have escaped uninjured after being trapped underground by a mineshaft fire on &lt;a href="Tasmania"&gt;Tasmania&lt;/a&gt;'s west coast. The men took shelter in a chamber more than a kilometre underground. A worker noticed smoke coming from a shaft at Avebury nickel mine on Trial Harbour Road near &lt;a href="w%3AZeehan%2C%20Tasmania"&gt;Zeehan&lt;/a&gt; at 7.45am. 

The blaze started after a truck working 400 metres underground toppled and caught fire. It took nearly five hours for rescue teams to bring the blaze under control, move the burning truck and reach the trapped miners.

Allegiance Mining chairman Tony Howland-Rose said the workers were safe. "The emergency response procedures in place at Avebury were activated and resulted in the vehicle fire being extinguished and the safe rescue of the miners," Mr Howland-Rose said.

Ambulance crews say the men appear to be in good health. Queenstown Police Inspector Mark Beech-Jones says rescue workers reached the men just before midday.

"We've dispatched a number of ambulance service personnel there just to give them a check up but from our initial discussions with them, they are fine," he said.

The Avebury nickel mine is a new project for the Sydney-based company - Allegiance Mining. Allegiance suspended trading on the stock exchange this morning. Mr Howland-Rose said the suspension of trading would be in place until it became clear what had happened at the mine. 

The mine is undergoing a $60 million redevelopment and was due to resume mining later this year.

The international environmental organisation, &lt;a href="w%3AGreenpeace"&gt;Greenpeace&lt;/a&gt;, have been shadowing a Japanese &lt;a href="w%3AWhaling"&gt;whaling&lt;/a&gt; fleet currently operating in the &lt;a href="w%3ASouthern%20Ocean"&gt;Southern Ocean&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Antarctic%20Territory"&gt;Australian Antarctic Territory&lt;/a&gt;. They claim a minor victory against the six-vessel fleet, saying no whales have been killed since Christmas Eve. However they expect a resumption of whaling and protest activity soon.

Greenpeace has two ships, MV Esperanza and MV Arctic Sunrise, active near &lt;a href="w%3AAntarctica"&gt;Antarctica&lt;/a&gt;, in an effort to disrupt the whalers, who intend on slaughtering over 900 &lt;a href="w%3AMinke%20whales"&gt;Minke whales&lt;/a&gt; and 10 &lt;a href="w%3AFin%20Whale"&gt;Fin whales&lt;/a&gt; in the region this summer. The activists aim to stop the Japanese whaling fleet as it tries to catch nearly 1000 whales for what is claimed to be scientific research.

Greenpeace chief Steve Shallhorn states that the protesters have chased the six-ship fleet northwards, with the vessels now away from the designated whaling zone. Greenpeace plan to maintain their efforts to keep the whalers in the public eye.

"What the fleet is doing is trying to outrun Greenpeace so that it can sneak back into the whaling grounds and resume the kill," he said. "And for that very reason, we're doing our very best and are succeeding in keeping up with the factory whaling ship. We are certain that they do not want any further publicity."

He said Greenpeace will continue its high-speed tailing for as long as it takes. "We're capable of staying out there for many more weeks," he said. "The [Japanese] fleet is clearly embarrassed by having their actions exposed to the world, since the spotlight on their activities shows what it really is - commercial whaling with a very thin disguise."

The whalers have been unable to kill any whales since Christmas Eve due to poor weather and harassment by Greenpeace vessels, and the Washington-based Sea Shepherd ship, &lt;a href="w%3AFarley%20Mowat%20%28Sea%20Shepherd%20vessel%29"&gt;RV Farley Mowat&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="w%3ASea%20Shepherd"&gt;Sea Shepherd&lt;/a&gt; is operating independently of Greenpeace but say they are working towards a common objective – "the shutting down of illegal whaling in the Southern Ocean."

Greenpeace expedition leader Shane Rattenbury says the whalers have a season of about 100 days. "Their quota is 945 whales. If you lose, say, 10 per cent of those through bad weather, they've got an average they need to catch of 10 a day and it's gone 10 days now without having any whales," he said. "That starts to add up pretty quickly. They're under a bit of pressure to get on with the business."

&lt;a href="w%3AInstitute%20of%20Cetacean%20Research"&gt;Japan's Institute for Cetacean Research&lt;/a&gt; have rejected the claims made by Sea Shepherd, that Japanese warship was being sent to Antarctica to protect the fleet against the activists. 

The Japanese institute spokesman condemned Sea Shepherd over the claim by Farley Mowat captain &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Watson"&gt;Paul Watson&lt;/a&gt;, who called on the Australian Government to keep the peace. 

Sea Shepherd had requested the presence of the Australian navy to monitor events in the Southern Ocean. However, Australia's environment minister, &lt;a href="w%3ASenator%20Ian%20Campbell"&gt;Senator Ian Campbell&lt;/a&gt;, said that Sea Shepherd's threats to attack the fleet "risk setting back the cause of whale conservation many years".

Capt Watson said yesterday: "Stop threatening us, Mr Campbell, and charge us if you believe we are acting unlawfully. Stop posing for the Japanese [who] are in blatant violation of international conservation laws."

Japan's Fisheries Agency, which conducts the whaling, said the claim was a tactic by Sea Shepherd to try to raise the stakes for extra publicity.

"This is why the environmentalists' campaign in the Antarctic is a PR stunt: every time they get some media coverage there's always some member not too far away asking the public for money," an agency spokesman said in a statement. "Only this time, it completely backfired and now people will question what these groups say."

The spokesman had no response to Greenpeace's claim that another vessel had joined the whaling fleet and was refuelling the ships within the boundary of the Antarctic Treaty's nature reserve.

Mr Rattenbury said the 57 activists and crew aboard the Greenpeace ships were in good health following a quiet New Year's Day celebration on deck under a midnight sun.
He said his ships were not in contact with the Farley Mowat, which is believed to be closer to the Antarctic ice shelf. The Farley Mowat's weblog quoted ship captain Paul Watson as saying the Sea Shepherd group had no conflict with Greenpeace, despite earlier British media assertions.

"As far as I am concerned both Sea Shepherd and Greenpeace are working towards a common objective – the shutting down of illegal whaling in the Southern Ocean," said Paul Watson.

Greenpeace believes the fleet killed at least 25 whales from the time it contacted the whalers just before Christmas.

Three home made bombs exploded during the night in &lt;a href="w%3AAthens"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt;, Greece. One of the bombs destroyed a Finnish diplomat's car. No one was injured in the bombings and a Greek group claiming to be &lt;a href="w%3AAnarchism"&gt;anarchists&lt;/a&gt; has told local media that it committed the bombings as retaliation for the jailing of fellow anarchists. The Finnish Foreign Ministry has said that it believes it was an accident that Finnish diplomatic property was damaged - as all the evidence points to this -, and Finnish diplomats in Athens are said to be calm.

A survey to test whether exposure to alcohol advertisements affects alcohol consumption by young people found that advertising does contribute to increased drinking, including among underage drinkers.

Researchers from the University of Connecticut surveyed 15 to 26 year olds, who reported their alcohol consumption over the previous month. The research then correlated this with the respondent's exposure to advertisement, and the money spent by companies on alcohol ads. The alcohol industry's measured media expenditure is roughly $1.8 billion per year. 

The study found that those youngsters exposed to more ads also drank more, and that markets with greater alcohol advertising expenditures also had greater alcohol consumption. These findings also oheld for drinking by those younger than the legal drinking age of 21 years. 

Alcohol use by the youth has been a matter of public concern, as it has been linked with lowered educational performance, risky sexual activity, motor accidents and addiction. Other surveys have found that underage drinkers account for 20% of alcohol consumption. Alcohol advertising is not subject to federal legislation, the industry follows a voluntary code of conduct. 

While many studies have found an association between alcohol advertising and use, the question of whether the link is a causal one is still unanswered. The present survey uses market-level measures of advertising to address criticism of previous studies that relying on self-reported exposure to advertisements might be biased as those who drink may be more likely to pay attention to, and remember the ads. 

The study found greater ad-spending in a market was related to both higher levels of youth drinking and steeper increases in drinking over time, which continued until respondents were in their mid-twenties. The link also held the other way: less alcohol advertising associated with less drinking, more modest increases in consumption over time during the respondents' early twenties and a steady decline in consumption after this period. The results are consistent with findings from studies of advertising bans. 

The study was funded by the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism

The industries voluntary guidelines specify that 70 percent of the audience for its advertising be at least 21 years old, the legal drinking age. Industry groups have claimed that its advertising affects only those older than the legal drinking age and that advertising at best causes brand switching. Reacting to the study, representatives of the alcohol industry in the UK, which has one of the highest youth drinking rates in Europe, said that there was a strict system in place controlling advertising. But studies have found that there is often greater concentrations of alcohol advertisements in media aimed at youth than at adults.

Former senator and former police chief Dany Toussaint was arrested by United Nations troops on alleged possession of illegal weapons. According to police sources Toussaint was arrested by Chilean troops when they found the weapons on him in Cap-Haitien. Toussaint was driving through a police checkpoint when the troops spotted the weapons and arrested him.

One police official said, "Dany Toussaint was carrying several weapons for which he has no valid authorization."

Among the alleged weapons are those obtained from parliament when Toussaint became a senator, but they were to be returned when his term as senator ended. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration has suspected Toussaint of drug trafficking in the past. Toussaint was also the suspect in the 2000 murder of a radio journalist, Jean Dominique. Currently Toussaint runs a private security company.

A powerful &lt;a href="w%3Aearthquake"&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt; measuring 7.1 on the Richter scale has struck in the &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Ocean"&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt; off the coast of &lt;a href="w%3AFiji"&gt;Fiji&lt;/a&gt; on Monday at 22:13 (10:13PM) (UTC).

The quake hit 579 kilometers below the Earth's surface about 100 kilometers North East of Ndoi, the US Geological Survey said.

No damage or injuries have been reported following the quake and the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said they did not expect it to trigger a &lt;a href="w%3ATsunami"&gt;tsunami&lt;/a&gt; as the quake happened far below the Earth's surface.

Lasarusa Veutibau, a seismologist at Fiji's Mines and Resources Department, said the quake was too deep to have been felt anywhere in the Fiji Islands.

&lt;a href="Jack%20Abramoff"&gt;Jack Abramoff&lt;/a&gt; pled guilty today to charges of mail fraud, tax evasion, and conspiracy charges stemming from the &lt;a href="w%3AJack%20Abramoff%23Indian%20tribes%20grand%20jury%20investigations"&gt;Indian Tribes&lt;/a&gt; investigation.

Abramoff, founder and former chairman of the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Freedom%20Foundation"&gt;International Freedom Foundation&lt;/a&gt; and former member of the Board of Directors of the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Center%20for%20Public%20Policy%20Research"&gt;National Center for Public Policy Research&lt;/a&gt;, reportedly agreed to cooperate in the prosecutor's case against Abramoff's former business partners, who are subjects of the &lt;a href="w%3AJack%20Abramoff%23SunCruz%20Casinos%20fraud%20indictment"&gt;SunCruz Casinos fraud&lt;/a&gt; investigation. Part of the three-count indictment charged Abramoff with influence-peddling a &lt;a href="US%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House Representative&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="Scotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; golf trip with US$50,000. The money in question was solicited from an Indian Tribe in Texas by Abramoff, and is rumoured to have gone to Representative &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Ney"&gt;Bob Ney&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="Ohio"&gt;OH&lt;/a&gt;).

In exchange for his testimony, Mr. Abramoff is expected to be sentenced to a maximum of 10 years imprisonment, and will be allowed to serve sentences concurrently. He is due in a &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; court on Wednesday in regards to the &lt;a href="w%3AJack%20Abramoff%23SunCruz%20Casinos%20fraud%20indictment"&gt;SunCruz&lt;/a&gt; case.

On the morning of Monday, January 2, 2006, the 117th Tournament of Roses &lt;a href="w%3ARose%20Parade"&gt;Rose Parade&lt;/a&gt; marched through &lt;a href="w%3APasadena%2C%20California"&gt;Pasadena, California&lt;/a&gt; in only the tenth occurrence of rain on the morning of the parade. Fifty mile-an-hour winds buffeted the crowds of spectators for hours before and during the festivities.

Many spectators had purchased grandstand tickets for $50 or more only to find the aluminum benches cold and exposed to the winds. Umbrellas were ubiquitus though difficult to use effectively in the storm-like conditions. Virtually anyone present for more than an hour had a poncho of some sort. Those who partook in the traditional campout to claim free seating on the street often left only a single person to stoically wait out the storm until morning, most preferring to sleep in dryer conditions. Crowds were smaller than normal.

Vendors fared somewhat differently, depending on what they sold. Sales of hot food and drinks, umbrellas, ponchos, and tarps were up while sales of pre-packaged snacks and programs were down. Many street vendors left once sales or inventory dried up (figuritively speaking).

&lt;a href="w%3AJohnson%20and%20Johnson"&gt;Johnson and Johnson&lt;/a&gt; has released information that two patients have died after taking the company's heart drug &lt;a href="w%3ANatrecor"&gt;Natrecor&lt;/a&gt;. The deaths were not included in a report of a study the company released in October, and the company says they did not know of the two deaths when the original report was released. The company intends to reanalyze the data to see if these two deaths are of statistical significance to the drug's risk.

Natrecor is a drug used to treat acute heart failure and has been approved by the &lt;a href="w%3AFood%20and%20Drug%20Administration"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt; since 2001. The FDA told the company a year ago to further explore the mortality data, in which the company said to have not found a statistically significant difference for mortality between the drug and a placebo.

A new report is said to be available in March about the possible health effects of the drug.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia%20First%20Party"&gt;Australia First Party&lt;/a&gt; is writing to its supporters requesting that they become members in order to re-register as a political party in &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;. Australia First is seen as a far-right wing party with nationalist ideals.

The party was founded in 1996 by Graeme Campbell a Member of the House of Representatives and the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Australian Labor Party&lt;/a&gt;. In 2001, Graeme Campbell, &lt;a href="w%3AOne%20Nation"&gt;One Nation&lt;/a&gt; offered to endorse him as a senate candidate in &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20Australia"&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt;. He failed to be elected in the October 2001 election and has remained within the One Nation Party. 

The party was de-registered by the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Electoral%20Commission"&gt;Australian Electoral Commission&lt;/a&gt; in 2004 for not nominating a single federal election candidate for four years.

Recently it has been alleged that the Australia First Party and its offspring the Patriotic Youth League had been involved in organising the racial violence in &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; in December last year. The party denies this claiming "There is no way a small group of young nationalists could organise 10,000 people to gather at Cronulla Beach". However the party's website does claim that "Australian Youth And Families Should Support The Cronulla Mass Mobilisation On December 11".

Once the party has been re-registered with the Australian Electoral Commission it intends to contest local government elections in the Sutherland Shire, Marrickville, Coffs Harbour and Newcastle before running for federal parliament in 2007.

The party's NSW Secretary, Jim Saleam said "What's being done in Australia now is a situation where the European identity is being deprecated further, to the point where Europeans will disappear next century".

"Under certain circumstances that would be called a genocide, but it's not, it's called progress."

Mr Saleam was jailed for three-and-a-half years in 1991 for possessing a firearm and organising a shotgun attack on the home of the African National Congress Australian representative, Eddie Funde.

The party needs 500 correctly completed membership applications to apply to the AEC for re-registration. The registration process will then take up to 12 weeks.

<h1>BASF makes $4.9 billion hostile bid for Engelhard</h1>

&lt;a href="w%3ABASF"&gt;BASF&lt;/a&gt; has made a $4.9 billion &lt;a href="w%3Atakeover"&gt;hostile&lt;/a&gt; bid for &lt;a href="w%3AEngelhard"&gt;Engelhard Corp&lt;/a&gt;. Engelhard is a US based supplier of pollution control devices such as &lt;a href="w%3Acatalytic%20converters"&gt;catalytic converters&lt;/a&gt;, which it invented. Engelhard holds 35% of the world market on such pollution control devices. The bid is $37 a share in cash and may be increased by $1 a share. 

BASF has over $4.79 billion for acquisitions after it sold Basell NV plastics in August. 

If the acquisition goes through it will be the biggest ever hostile takeover of a US company by a European firm according to &lt;a href="w%3ABloomberg%20Television"&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;.

Engelhard shares have surged above the offer price on the news to about $38 a share. Some speculate &lt;a href="w%3ADow%20Chemical"&gt;Dow Chemical Co.&lt;/a&gt;, the largest US chemical maker, will make a competing offer. 

"Dow has an automotive materials business like BASF, and is diversified like BASF so that it could use all the pieces" said John Roberts, a Buckingham Research analyst.

US regulations going into effect in 2007 are tighter on emmissions. This will increase the demand for Engelhard's catalytic converters. Limits are getting tighter in the EU and Japan as well.

Dow Chemical declined to comment on the bid or the possibility of the corporation making a bid, stating "it's Dow's policy not to comment on speculation regarding possible investment opportunities".

&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; has officially recorded its warmest year on record. According to the &lt;a href="w%3ABureau%20of%20Meteorology"&gt;Bureau of Meteorology, (BOM)&lt;/a&gt; 2005 was the hottest year since reliable, widespread temperature observations became available in 1910. Data collected by the Bureau show Australia's annual mean temperature for 2005 was 1.09°C above the standard 1961-90 average.

The Bureau of Meteorology says the result is more evidence of climate change. 

The Bureau's Blair Trewin said: "We've seen things like the general retreat of the winter snow line. We've seen a marked decrease in the frequency of frost, especially in inland &lt;a href="Queensland"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt;," Dr Trewin said. "We've seen an increase in the number of extreme hot days."

And the warming trend is likely to continue. "All the projections we have from climate models we would expect to see continued warming through the 21st century," he said. "Numbers like this ... are another piece of evidence that climate change is real and it's a real issue."

Despite unseasonably cool weather in the &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20West%20region%20of%20Western%20Australia"&gt;South West of Western Australia&lt;/a&gt;, 2005 was a hot year over most of the nation, with the &lt;a href="Northern%20Territory%2C%20Australia"&gt;Northern Territory (NT)&lt;/a&gt; bearing the brunt. The NT area-average maximum temperature was 1.45°C above the long-term mean, the largest anomaly of any state or territory. 

The previous record of +0.84°C was set in 1998. The Bureau says that while these temperature departures may seem relatively small, a 1°C increase in mean temperatures is equivalent to many southern Australian towns shifting northward by about 100km.

All States and Territories, apart from &lt;a href="Victoria%2C%20Australia"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Tasmania"&gt;Tasmania&lt;/a&gt;, recorded 2005 mean temperatures amongst their top two warmest years on record. The only region recording a cooler than normal year was a coastal strip of &lt;a href="Western%20Australia"&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt; extending from &lt;a href="w%3ACape%20Leeuwin"&gt;Cape Leeuwin&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3ACarnarvon"&gt;Carnarvon&lt;/a&gt;.

Australia's previous warmest years on record were influenced by significant &lt;a href="w%3AEl%20Ni%C3%B1o"&gt;El Niño&lt;/a&gt; events, say the Bureau. However, no such event occurred in 2005, making the record warmth even more unusual. Since 1979, all but four years have been warmer than average in Australia.

Australian temperatures have increased by approximately 0.9ºC since 1910 - consistent with global warming trends. Scientific studies have linked global and Australian temperature increases to the enhanced greenhouse effect. 

The early months of 2005 were also very dry over much of Australia with the January-May period being the 2nd driest on record. Australia's area-averaged rainfall is calculated from a network of around 5000 rainfall stations. Observations from this network reveal that, when compared to historical records, Tasmania was the wettest State in 2005, while Queensland and Western Australia were the driest. 

Over the New Year bushfires have caused havoc in many parts of Australia, with houses, farm stock devastated. Thousands of hectares of bushland and farmland have been burnt out.

Environmentalists say the weather is a precursor of things to come: "2005 gave us a little taste of what life will be like if we fail to tackle climate change," &lt;a href="Greenpeace"&gt;Greenpeace&lt;/a&gt;'s Catherine Fitzpatrick said. "The extreme heat and bushfires of New Year's Day 2006 showed that it isn't going to be fun. If action isn't taken soon to avoid catastrophic climate change, Australians will have &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; to blame for failing to act when he had the chance."

Ms Fitzpatrick said the &lt;a href="w%3AGovernment%20of%20Australia"&gt;Federal Government&lt;/a&gt; was as beholden to the coal and aluminium industries as the &lt;a href="w%3AJapanese%20government"&gt;Japanese government&lt;/a&gt; was to &lt;a href="w%3Awhaling"&gt;whaling&lt;/a&gt; companies, and with far more devastating impacts. "Today's figures should spur our Environment Minister ... to real action – ratify Kyoto, quit coal and move towards clean, renewable energy," Ms Fitzpatrick said.

The Howard government claims it is taking appropriate action. &lt;a href="w%3AIan%20Campbell"&gt;Federal Environment Minister Ian Campbell&lt;/a&gt; said he recognised climate change was the biggest modern-day environmental challenge. "I think that climate change is alarming," he said on ABC radio. "I regard climate change as the number one environmental challenge ... It is a huge and serious challenge. These figures add to the weight of evidence that climate change is real and it's a problem that the world needs to work together to seek to solve."

Australia and the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; are the only developed nations to have refused to sign the &lt;a href="w%3AKyoto%20Protocol"&gt;Kyoto Protocol&lt;/a&gt;, which calls on countries to cut greenhouse emissions by 5.2 per cent below 1990 levels by 2012.

The Government argues Kyoto will not work because it does not commit developing nations to reducing emissions. "Kyoto excludes most of the emissions in the world. It only covers just over a third of the countries of the world and ... we need something that includes all countries of the world," said Senator Campbell.

Many regions across the globe also reported an exceptionally warm year. According to a preliminary estimate released by the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Meteorological%20Organization"&gt;World Meteorological Organization (WMO)&lt;/a&gt;, the global mean temperature for 2005 was about 0.48°C above normal, putting 2005 amongst the four warmest years globally since records commenced in 1861.

According to many news sources including ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AUSA%20Today"&gt;USA Today&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, reports indicate that 12 coal miners have been found dead in the mine in &lt;a href="w%3ASago%2C%20West%20Virginia"&gt;Sago, West Virginia&lt;/a&gt; and only one has survived, reversing reports three hours earlier that 12 had been found alive -- a report that had caused celebration amongst family members and friends. 

The family members of the dead miners were notified of the deaths by Ben Hatfield, CEO of the International Coal Groi[, at the Sago Baptist Church. Hatfield blamed the reversal on "bad information" and "miscommunication." 

"What happened is that through stray cell phone conversations it appears that this miscommunication from the rescue team underground to the command center was picked up by various people that simply overheard the conversation that was relayed over cell phone communications without our ever having made a [public news] release," explained Hatfield.

Family members walked out of the church saying that the CEO of the mining company had "lied to them". The surviving miner, Randal McCloy, is currently in critical condition at Ruby Memorial Hospital in Morgantown, West Virginia.

The United States Mine Safety and Health Administration issued the mine 208 citations last year, an increase from 68 reported in 2004. Federal regulations cover concerns over accumulations of combustible materials, including methane gas and coal dust from loose coal, in addition to other safety issues. The agency has announced that it plans launch a in-depth investigation into the incident at Sago. The investigation will examine the mine's compliance with health and safety standards and how emergency information was communicated.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AChristmas"&gt;Christmas&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Year"&gt;New Year&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aroad%20toll"&gt;road toll&lt;/a&gt; has climbed to 9 more than the 11 deaths in the entire period last year, after a Korean man became the 20th victim when his car ended up in a canal.

The official Christmas-New Year road toll runs between 4pm on 24th December and 6am on 4th January.

The final tally still needs to be officially confirmed by the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Police"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt;; this should happen in the next 1 to 2 months. Police National Road Safety Manager, Inspector John Kelly, says “the final toll may fluctuate, depending on the outcome of investigations into the crashes that took place."

The fatalities are: eight passengers, seven drivers, three motorcyclists and two pedestrians. 

"The toll is one of the highest” says Andy Knackstedt, from LTNZ, “it's certainly nearly double the number that died on the roads [in the holiday period] last year”. 

In 2005, for the full year, 404 people died on New Zealand roads, which is 31 less than the previous year.

NORMAN, Okla. – National Weather Service officials are warning of continued fire dangers throughout Oklahoma and Texas due to serious drought conditions.

More than 220 homes and businesses have been destroyed by fire in Oklahoma since Nov. 1, according to the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management. Wildfires in 29 of the state’s 77 counties have claimed more than 360,000 acres. Meanwhile, officials in Texas say 238 homes and 254,555 acres have been lost to wildfires in that state since Dec. 26.

Unseasonably warm weather and wind gusts of up to 40 mph have combined to make an already dangerous situation worse across the Southern Plains, which also include parts of Kansas, Colorado and New Mexico, said Jason Levit of the National Storm Prediction Center in Norman.

“The region also continues to remain in a severe to extreme drought situation,” Levit said. “Dry surface vegetation will continue to serve as an excellent fuel for any fires that develop.”

Some dry areas, such as the Rocky Mountains and Great Lakes, may soon see some much-needed rain. Levit says the already fire-ravaged Southern Plains will have no such luck, however, and people should be aware of the severe danger that will continue to threaten the region.

In Oklahoma, state authorities and the National Guard have established a command post in Shawnee, about 40 miles east of Oklahoma City, where they have been joined by officials from the U.S. Forest Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the National Weather Service.

The state was granted access to relief from the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Dec. 28, said Gov. Brad Henry. The Governor requested fire management grants to help cover expenses related to the wildfires that began the previous day. FEMA’s approval means funds are now available to local governments and volunteer fire departments that responded to the blazes in Hughes and Seminole counties. Requests involving nine other counties were approved in the days that followed.

Fires hit the northeastern part of Oklahoma City, the state’s capital and largest city, on Sunday. Fires were said to have destroyed 20 homes over the weekend.

A National Guard helicopter and firefighters from North Carolina were sent to battle a blaze near the town of Davis, in south-central Oklahoma, on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the BIA sent two airplanes to help fight a fire near Eufaula, in eastern Oklahoma. Three other BIA aircraft aided crews fighting fires near Wewoka, in central Oklahoma, and additional fires were reported near Knowles, Oklahoma City, Ponca City and Tishmingo.

Authorities said additional National Guard helicopters and Forest Service planes are available to battle other fires as they break out.
In addition to teams from North Carolina, other firefighters from Alabama, Florida, and Tennessee have arrived and are being stationed throughout the state.

The Oklahoma State Medical Examiner’s Office said one man has died from injuries sustained from recent wildfires. A 68-year-old Hughes County man died Dec. 28 from thermal burns and smoke inhalation. The death is in addition to that of a 68-year-old Carter County woman who died last month while trying to use a garden hose to save her home from being consumed by flames.

The governor’s office said the state continues to await word on a request for a federal disaster declaration made Friday. A disaster declaration by President George W. Bush would qualify Oklahoma for federal funds to place firefighters ahead of where blazes are burning, and would provide temporary housing assistance and low-interest loans for those whose homes or businesses have been destroyed.

Texas authorities say they have 92 aircraft and 650 state workers working to fight fires, and have been joined by crews from Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Tennessee, and Wisconsin. The U.S. Forest Service is also helping the state to handle the emergency.

Despite efforts, wildfires on Monday claimed nearly the entire town of Ringgold, destroying 45 buildings that comprised about 80 percent of the town.

The official mourning period will last for 40 days, during which all UAE flags will fly at half mast. Ministries and government organisations will be closed for seven days, starting Wednesday. 

Local stock markets in Abu Dhabi and Dubai shed 1.8% and 3.3%, respectively, in early trading.

The Dubai Shopping Festival, the largest business &amp; cultural event in Dubai's calendar, has been postponed until further notice, in a statement by CEO Saeed Al Nabouda.

&lt;a href="w%3AMohammed%20bin%20Rashid%20Al%20Maktoum"&gt;Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum&lt;/a&gt; has been named the new ruler of Dubai, in an accession process that officials described as being automatic.

The Russian concern &lt;a href="w%3AGazprom"&gt;Gazprom&lt;/a&gt; stopped supplying gas to &lt;a href="w%3AMoldova"&gt;Moldova&lt;/a&gt; on January 1, as the latter did not sign a gas supply contract, which stipulates a price of 160 dollars per 1,000 cubic metres for the next three months, according to officials of Chisinau and Russian concern Gazprom.

In connection with this situation, &lt;a href="w%3AVladimir%20Voronin"&gt;Vladimir Voronin&lt;/a&gt;, current president of Moldova, cancelled his winter vacation and created on Monday, 2 January, an anti-crisis group, composed of the representatives of the cabinet and SA Moldova-Gaz.

At the moment, Moldova is ensured gas from &lt;a href="w%3AUkraine"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;, in proportion of 50%, according to an agreement between Voronin and his Ukrainian counterpart &lt;a href="w%3AViktor%20Yushchenko"&gt;Viktor Yushchenko&lt;/a&gt;.

The head of the Moldovan state stated that, theoretically, he agrees to accept the market prices of gas, but, pursuant to him, these must be "logical and not illusory”. 

Moldova will continue negotiations with Gazprom. An operative staff on energy security headed by Minister Vladimir Antosii was created for this purpose.

Chisinau officials say that an agreement on transit of Russian gas through Moldova should be signed on January 3, and an agreement on new prices was expected to be signed later. The situation in Moldova, which does not have other gas sources, is unique, as 15 percent of the natural gas supplies of Russia are transited to the West through Moldova's territory. Negotiators have recently agreed in Moscow on a transit price of 2.5 dollars for transportation of 1,000 cubic metres on a distance of 100 kilometres.

This is an excerpt translation of a text found on the German wikipedia site, with an update. 

Bad Reichenhall, Germany.
The roof over the local ice and tennis court crashed shortly after the end of the official skating time on 2 Jan 05, at about 16.50 hrs. At the time, there were about 50 people inside, mostly families with children. By 10 pm, five had been found dead, one child among them. 20 to 25 people have been injured, just as many are missing. 

The reason for the cave-in of the roof was most likely massive snowfalls. Earlier that afternoon, measurements had been taken to determine its stability. Icehockey training had been cancelled for that day. Continuing snowfalls hinder the rescue efforts. 

Update on 4 January, 15:42 GMT: So far, 14 bodies have been found.

The men, ages 21 and 19, were both hit. One of the individuals was killed, and the other is in good condition at a nearby hospital. Although there has been some speculation that the missionaries were shot because they may have witnessed a crime, no specific details are available at this time. The gunman, described as a 5'10" black male, escaped on foot.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has approximately 56,000 young men and women performing full-time missionary work throughout the world. Missionary work is done on a volunteer basis, and young men are expected to serve a mission shortly after their 19th birthday. Male missionaries remain in the field for two years unless there are extenuating circumstances.

The murder was Chesapeake's first such crime of 2006. There were 15 murders in the city in 2005.

The old European Union countries have asked the US to put back its biometric passport deadline for another year, as biometric data inclusion issues still needed to be resolved. 

In the meantime, the new eastern EU countries are more preoccupied with less sophisticated issues relating to passports, namely the uniform colour required for all EU states.

In former USSR states such as the Baltic state of &lt;a href="w%3ALithuania"&gt;Lithuania&lt;/a&gt; this new Burgundy-colored document may remind many of the Soviet-era dark red passports.

Mr P. Austrevicius, former Chief Negotiator of the Lithuania - EU Entrance Team said to Lithuania's newspaper &lt;a href="http%3A//www.atgimimas.lt"&gt;Atgimimas&lt;/a&gt;: “If we decline Europe's unifying stuff, such as a common passport, how else can we join Europe? I don't see any association with the Soviet Union”

But according to journalist Indrė Makaraitytė, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.delfi.lt/news/daily/comments/article.php%3Fid%3D8417262%28Atgimimas%29"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; an unnamed diplomat stated: “We already have had a red colored passport and it can be a sensitive case in our society. We should take this into account".

Two years on from the raids that signalled the start of what is generally accepted to be a separatist campaign in the south of &lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;, military forces in the area remain on alert for a repeat of the daring raid that saw four soldiers killed and over 400 guns stolen.

The raid on Ratchanakharin army camp in &lt;a href="w%3ANarathiwat%20Province"&gt;Narathiwat Province&lt;/a&gt; announced the most recent expression of nationalistic beliefs in the predominantly Muslim provinces that once made up the Malay Sultinate of Pattani, insurgency action since that time has seen over 1,000 killed, mainly through attacks allegedly made by insurgents. One of the most significant aspects of the raid was that it provided arms for the insurgency movement. According to the government of Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AThaksin%20Shinawatra"&gt;Thaksin Shinawatra&lt;/a&gt;, the movement is home-grown and does not include foreign fighters. This significant supply of arms and ammunition has allowed a considerable number of attacks such as drive-by shootings, and efforts to recover the stolen weapons have had minimal success with only ten or less of the guns reportedly recovered.

Despite the majority of casualties having been caused by the insurgents, inexperience in handling a modern guerilla campaign have seen actions of Thai security forces the cause of casualties, most notable being the Tak Bai incident where 78 men died in custody. This has not helped in convincing the local community that the government has their best interests in mind.

&lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israeli&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20minister"&gt;prime minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAriel%20Sharon"&gt;Ariel Sharon&lt;/a&gt; (born Ariel Sheinerman), 77, has been admitted to &lt;a href="w%3AHadassah"&gt;Hadassah&lt;/a&gt; hospital in &lt;a href="w%3AJerusalem"&gt;Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt;, after suffering what doctors said was a "massive" &lt;a href="w%3Astroke"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt;.

According to reports from Hadassah Ein Karem hospital in &lt;a href="w%3AJerusalem"&gt;Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt;, the Prime Minister was put under an anesthetic prior to surgery to address a massive cerebral hemorrhage. He has increased intracranial pressure due to the bleeding.

&lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; press secretary Scott McClellan said in Thursday's press briefing that its "thoughts and prayers" are with the Prime Minister, and that the White House will "continue to stay in touch with the government of Israel."

With Sharon in the hospital, control of Israel has now been transferred to his deputy, vice-premier &lt;a href="w%3AEhud%20Olmert"&gt;Ehud Olmert&lt;/a&gt;.

Dr. Shlomo Mor-Yosef, director of Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem said that Sharon suffered "a significant stroke" and that he was "under anesthetic and receiving breathing assistance." Minutes later, Mor-Yosef said that initial tests showed Sharon suffered a cerebral hemorrhage and that he was suffering "massive bleeding and was being transferred to an operating theater."

After over 6 hours of surgery Sharon received another &lt;a href="CT%20scan"&gt;CT scan&lt;/a&gt; which revealed further bleeding. Sharon was returned to the operating room for additional surgery that is expected to last several hours.

According to &lt;a href="Wikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, "A stroke or cerebrovascular accident (CVA) occurs when the blood supply to a part of the brain is suddenly interrupted" and many news sources are reporting this situation is life threatening.

Last month on December 18th, Sharon suffered a minor stroke and was admitted to the Hadassah Ein Kerem hospital after feeling unwell driving home and having difficulties with his speech. During his treatment, he was found to have a minor hole in his heart and was scheduled for surgery on January 5th. Sharon was treated and released December 20th.

Sharon's notorious overeating was a significant risk factor for the health complications he has experienced. Prior to his first stroke, he consumed a meal consisting of hamburgers, lamb, kebabs, steak in chimchurri sauce, and salad. Since that stroke Sharon had lost weight, though he had been known to have his security detail smuggle him pita filled with greasy meat during previous efforts. 

On January 6th, in a front-page &lt;a href="http%3A//www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/TPStory/LAC/20060106/SHARONMEDIC06/TPInternational"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Globe%20and%20Mail"&gt;The Globe and Mail&lt;/a&gt; newspaper, Canadian medical experts questioned the anticoagulent that Sharon had been receiving before his massive stroke, noting that the decision to use it may have cost him his life, and that he would have been unlikely to receive that treatment in Canada. They also noted that his prognosis for recovery is extremely poor.

The &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Supreme%20Court"&gt;U.S. Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; ordered Wednesday that accused "enemy combatant" &lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9%20Padilla%20%28alleged%20terrorist%29"&gt;José Padilla&lt;/a&gt;, a U.S. citizen, be transferred from military to civilian custody, in order to face charges of supporting terrorism. This latest move comes after much criticism from civil rights groups, several court rulings, and a request from the &lt;a href="w%3ABush%20administration"&gt;Bush administration&lt;/a&gt;.

Reportedly a former Chicago gang member, Padilla was arrested in 2002 as an "enemy combatant", on accusations of taking part in a plot to &lt;a href="w%3Adirty%20bomb"&gt;dirty-bomb&lt;/a&gt; apartment buildings, and has been held for the past three years without charge and denied legal rights applied to other U.S. citizens.

The charges he is presently facing are apparently unrelated, instead concerning his alleged aid in financing and recruiting terrorists.

The Supreme Court's ruling contradicts the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals' decision made only last month.

The Labor Party of Australia has today launched "Our Drowning Neighbours", a Pacific Climate Change strategy. The strategy was announced at 11am today, at Parliament House, Canberra, by Bob Sercombe MP (Shadow Minister for Pacific Island Affairs and Overseas Aid) and &lt;a href="Anthony%20Albanese"&gt;Anthony Albanese&lt;/a&gt; MP (Shadow Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Water).

Senator Bob Brown of the Australian Greens party welcomed aspects of the statement but suggested that the policy as stated was weak and pointed out that Labor had voted against Greens Senator Christine Milne's motion calling for recognition of Pacific climate change refugees just two months previously.

&lt;a href="w%3AJapan%20Post"&gt;Japan Post&lt;/a&gt; apologized yesterday after an eighteen year old school student, employed part-time to deliver &lt;a href="w%3AJapanese%20New%20Year%23New%20Year.27s%20Day%20Postcard"&gt;New Year postcards&lt;/a&gt; (known as ♡❤nengajō♡❤), had instead discarded 430 of them along with 170 other postal documents in the snow.

The papers, letters, and postcards -- many hand-written -- were damaged as a result. He had also reportedly considered hiding the cards at his house or taking them to a vacant lot.

"Since there were too many and it seemed a tiresome [job] for me, I hid them", said the boy to his bosses at &lt;a href="w%3AObanazawa%2C%20Yamagata"&gt;Obanazawa-city&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AYamagata%20Prefecture"&gt;Yamagata Prefecture&lt;/a&gt; Post Office, who enforced disciplinary penalties and said they will pursue legal charges.

The issue started on January 1st when dozens of local residents started complaining to the Obanazawa &lt;a href="w%3Apost%20office"&gt;Post Office&lt;/a&gt; that they hadn't received their traditional and regular New Year cards. Yesterday, the post office released their apology to citizens and the media after discovering that the boy had hidden more than 600 postal documents, including 429 New Year postcards, which weren't delivered to their intended recipients.

A 14 year old Turkish male has died from &lt;a href="avian%20influenza"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;. According to the &lt;a href="World%20Health%20Organization"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WHO), it is most likely the teenager died from the deadly &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; strain of the virus.

The teenager's sister has also been infected with another sibling also suspected to have the virus. Eight other people, mostly from the same family have been hospitalized in the city of Van, Turkey with flu-like symptoms.

The children were from Dogu Beyazit, a farming town in eastern Turkey. It is believed that the children raised poultry on a small farm and may have been in contact with sick birds. The family also ate diseased poultry.

The young male was originally thought to have died from a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Apnuemonia"&gt;pnuemonia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; related infection. Later tests revealed that the male had in fact died from bird flu.

According to Huseyin Avni Sahin, the head doctor of the hospital in Van where the teenager was treated, "(The boy) died of the H5N1 strain of bird flu". Turkish Health Minister Recep Akdag gave no specific details and said samples had been sent to the WHO and Britain for more tests.

If the teenager is confirmed to have had H5N1, it would be the first death from H5N1 in &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;.

Huseyin Avni Sahin has requested more ventilators to treat the ill people.

While H5N1 remains difficult for humans to contract, authorities fear it may mutate into a form that is passable among humans. Such a mutation could kill millions of people around the globe.

Figures issued by the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade show that in the twelve months to October, 2005 exports from &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; fell by 4.7 per cent while imports from the US rose 5.7 per cent. Australia and the US entered into a free trade agreement which began in January, 2005.

During the drafting of the agreement it drew heavy criticism for only opening parts of the US market to Australia.

The &lt;a href="w%3AGovernment%20of%20Australia"&gt;Australian Government&lt;/a&gt; insists that the results are due to a stronger Australian Dollar and increased competition from Asia. Acting prime minister, Mark Vaile said while exports to the US slowed, Australia was exporting to other markets "At the same time, there have been buoyant and robust economies operating in north Asia that have been very attractive for our exporters to go into those markets, so you can't just look at 12 months in isolation."

Critics of the Free Trade Agreement are calling on the government to use its escape clause. "Our argument is that we should be looking seriously at the provision in the agreement (under which) the Government can give six months notice to end the agreement" said Public Interest Advocacy Centre policy officer Patricia Ranald.

Mark Vaile has also indicated that he wishes to lobby the US to include sugar in the free trade agreement. This has received strong opposition from sugar farmers in the US.

The news comes just days after Mark Vaile announced that the government were considering dropping an amendment to the FTA to protect generic medicines.

&lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Texas%20at%20Austin"&gt;The University of Texas&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATexas%20Longhorn%20Athletics"&gt;Longhorns&lt;/a&gt; won the &lt;a href="w%3ARose%20Bowl%20Game"&gt;Rose Bowl&lt;/a&gt; and the 2005 &lt;a href="w%3ANCAA%20Division%20I-A%20national%20football%20championship"&gt;National Championship&lt;/a&gt; with a 41-38 victory over the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Southern%20California"&gt;University of Southern California&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUSC%20Trojans%20football"&gt;Trojans&lt;/a&gt;.

Texas quarterback and &lt;a href="w%3AHeisman%20Trophy"&gt;Heisman Trophy&lt;/a&gt; candidate &lt;a href="w%3AVince%20Young"&gt;Vince Young&lt;/a&gt; sealed the win with an 8 yard run on fourth down with 5 yards to go and 19 seconds remaining. The Longhorns followed the play with a successful &lt;a href="w%3Atwo-point%20conversion"&gt;two-point conversion&lt;/a&gt;.

Young rushed for 200 yards and passed for 267 yards in the game; his combined 467 total yards of offense set a Rose Bowl record. 

The victory by the Longhorns ended USC's 34-game winning streak &amp;mdash; then the longest in the nation. With the win, the Longhorns now control the longest streak at 20 wins. The Trojans, coached by Pete Carroll, came into the game ranked no. 1 in both the BCS and AP polls. Considering USC's streak and the Longhorns no. 2 ranking, the Texas victory was considered an upset.

The morning of the victory President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; called Texas coach &lt;a href="w%3AMack%20Brown"&gt;Mack Brown&lt;/a&gt; to congratulate the Longhorns and their victory.

<h1>Deaths on South African roads at 1215 for December 2005</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Deaths%20on%20South%20African%20roads%20at%201215%20for%20December%202005&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
According to the &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Africa"&gt;South African&lt;/a&gt; government's Department of Transport, the number of fatalities on the country's roads during December 2005 was 1,215. This is compared with 1,234 the previous year, where the total number of deaths in traffic accidents was 10,530.

Department of Transport spokeswoman, Collen Msibi, stated that 512 of the fatalities were pedestrians, 414 passengers, and 289 drivers. 2005 saw the number of vehicles on South Africa's roads rise by nearly half a million to just under eight million with 779,000 new drivers adding to the dangers on the country's roads.

"To deal with this high level of unsafety, traffic authorities will increase the number of patrol vehicles on the road, law enforcement officers and unmarked vehicles to do more spot checks and roadblocks," Msibi said.

"Our analysis has revealed that most accidents are preceded by offences such as ignoring road signs, driving drunk, speeding, vehicles cutting in front of others, driving defective vehicles and fatigue."

The road toll in South Africa is similar to that of &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;. However, except for South Korea these countries have significantly larger populations.

The worst country in the world for deaths in road traffic accidents, is currently accepted to be China. Figures released for 2002 reveal that 250,007 people were killed in that year.

The South African government has acknowledged the problem since 2001. At that time they launched their "Arrive Alive" campaign, targeting vehicle condition, driver fitness, speeding and drunk driving.

A hostel collapsed in &lt;a href="w%3AMecca"&gt;Mecca&lt;/a&gt;, the holy city of &lt;a href="w%3AIslam"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt; at about 10 o'clock this morning local time. The building housed a number of pilgrims who came to visit the holy city at the eve of hajj pilgrimage. The hostel's guests were mostly citizens of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Arab%20Emirates"&gt;United Arab Emirates&lt;/a&gt;. The death toll is at least 15, a figure which is expected to rise. The building was situated very close to the holy mosque &lt;a href="w%3AMasjid%20al%20Haram"&gt;Masjid al Haram&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>VP Cheney role surfaces in U.S. domestic spying</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=VP%20Cheney%20role%20surfaces%20in%20U.S.%20domestic%20spying&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; Vice President &lt;a href="Dick%20Cheney"&gt;Dick Cheney&lt;/a&gt;, in a speech to the &lt;a href="w%3AHeritage%20Foundation"&gt;Heritage Foundation&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday, admitted to a key role in the domestic spying program. In a ringing defense of the warrantless eavesdropping authorized by President Bush, Cheney said he had "personally presided" over most briefings of selected Capitol Hill lawmakers about the program, which was begun in response to the 9/11 attacks and after Congress passed a September 2001 resolution authorizing the use of force to combat terrorism.

The &lt;a href="National%20Security%20Agency"&gt;National Security Agency&lt;/a&gt; (NSA) has been monitoring certain domestic telephone calls and emails, under the condition that the other end of the message is to or from a foreign location, the White House has admitted. In addition, the ♡❤New York Times♡❤ has reported that the agency has been conducting a widespread data-mining operation of such messages, hoping to identify patterns that might tip off the U.S. government to terrorist operations. Bush quickly backed up the decision by &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Hayden"&gt;Michael Hayden&lt;/a&gt;, then NSA chief and now deputy national intelligence director, repeatedly authorizing the NSA to conduct warrantless searches, according to published reports.

Cheney vigorously defended the program, arguing that it could have prevented the 9/11 attacks, though a ♡❤Washington Post♡❤ report of his speech notes flaws in his reasoning. Cheney avoided mention of words such as "warrantless" and gave no explanation of why the secretive &lt;a href="w%3AForeign%20Intelligence%20Surveillance%20Act"&gt;Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act&lt;/a&gt; court, which normally issues national security warrants, needed to be bypassed. He asserted however that "the civil liberties of the American people are unimpeded" by the "wartime measure."

Cheney may face pressure by some in Congress, such as Republican Senator Arlen Specter, who has pledged to investigate the eavesdropping program, to testify on Capitol Hill, though Cheney is known to be a major proponent of executive privilege and may well resist.
The vice president, anticipating a "spirited debate" on the necessity of the program, said the leak of "highly classified" data to the ♡❤NYTimes♡❤ had been a "clear detriment to our national security."

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice"&gt;Justice Department&lt;/a&gt; launched a probe last week to seek the source of leaked information about the secretive program. No report has emerged that the Justice Department is making a formal inquiry into possible illegalities that might have occurred on the part of the NSA or White House. Many in Congress are interested in this point, as some see this surveillance of U.S. citizens as a violation of their &lt;a href="w%3AFourth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution"&gt;Fourth Amendment&lt;/a&gt; right guarding against unreasonable searches.

The Justice Department head and former White House counsel, &lt;a href="Alberto%20Gonzales"&gt;Alberto Gonzales&lt;/a&gt;, has defended the NSA program as legal and constitutional.

In a recent ZNet Commentary, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHoward%20Zinn"&gt;Howard Zinn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wrote that a group of people, including &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGino%20Strada"&gt;Gino Strada&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Farmer"&gt;Paul Farmer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKurt%20Vonnegut"&gt;Kurt Vonnegut&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANadine%20Gordimer"&gt;Nadine Gordimer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEduardo%20Galeano"&gt;Eduardo Galeano&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , are promoting the creation of worldwide gatherings to renounce war. Their intention, according to Zinn, is to make worldwide renunciation of war so popular that halting existing wars and preventing the beginning of new wars is politically irresistible.

In his article, ♡❤After This War♡❤, Zinn asks, "should we not think beyond this war? Should we begin to think, even before this shameful war is over, about ending our addiction to massive violence, and using the enormous wealth of our country for human needs?" He goes on to talk of ending not just "this war or that war but war itself. Perhaps the time has come to bring an end to war, and turn the human race onto a path of health and healing."

The five people have been actively involved in global issues for many years and have a solid track record of accomplishments on the world stage.

Dr. Gino Strada is a war surgeon and the founder of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEmergency%20%28NGO%29"&gt;Emergency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a nonprofit, humanitarian organization dedicated to providing assistance to civilian victims of war. His recent book ♡❤Green Parrots: A War Surgeon's Diary♡❤ helped persuade &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to abandon the use and manufacture of a flying anti-personnel mine.

Dr. Paul Farmer is a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHarvard%20University"&gt;Harvard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; professor and practicing physician. In 1987, he helped found the worldwide health organization &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APartners%20in%20Health"&gt;Partners in Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which treats some of the poorest people on Earth. Dr. Paul Farmer has received a "genius" award from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMacArthur%20Foundation"&gt;MacArthur Foundation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . 

Kurt Vonnegut is an &lt;a href="US"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; writer and humanist, currently serving as Honorary President of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Humanist%20Association"&gt;American Humanist Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . As a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWWII"&gt;WWII&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; prisoner of war in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADresden%2C%20Germany"&gt;Dresden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Kurt witnessed the fire bombing of Dresden. This event formed the core of his book ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASlaughterhouse-Five"&gt;Slaughterhouse-Five&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤. In a column for ♡❤In These Times♡❤, he began "... our leaders are power-drunk chimpanzees ... the morale of our soldiers fighting and dying in the Middle East ... like so many bodies, is already shot to pieces. They are being treated, as I never was, like toys a rich kid got for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChristmas"&gt;Christmas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ."

Nadine Gordimer from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; received the 1991 &lt;a href="Nobel%20Prize"&gt;Nobel Prize&lt;/a&gt; in literature and 1974 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABooker%20Prize"&gt;Booker Prize&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . She received worldwide praise for her leadership for South Africa to re-examine and replace its long held racist policy of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aapartheid"&gt;apartheid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Eduardo Galeano's books combine history, political analysis, journalism and fiction. "I'm a writer obsessed with remembering, with remembering the past of America ... condemned to amnesia. ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Open%20Veins%20of%20Latin%20America"&gt;The Open Veins of Latin America&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ is one of Galeano's works covering the exploitation of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALatin%20America"&gt;Latin America&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by foreign powers from the 15th century onwards.

Both Nadine and Eduardo's books are recognized by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGreat%20Books%20Foundation"&gt;Great Books Foundation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as among the top 40 books in Citizens of the World: Readings in Human Rights. ♡❤We Say No♡❤ by Eduardo Galeano and ♡❤Comrades♡❤ by Nadine Gordimer are listed there along with the ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEmancipation%20Proclamation"&gt;Emancipation Proclamation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAbraham%20Lincoln"&gt;Abraham Lincoln&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , ♡❤Independence♡❤ by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMahatma%20Gandhi"&gt;Mahatma Gandhi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUniversal%20Declaration%20of%20Human%20Rights"&gt;Universal Declaration of Human Rights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤, and ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALetter%20from%20Birmingham%20Jail"&gt;Letter from Birmingham Jail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20Luther%20King%20Jr."&gt;Martin Luther King Jr.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 

Howard Zinn is a U.S. historian, political scientist and author of fifteen books. Howard writes, "In a world of clashing interests—war against peace, nationalism against internationalism, equality against greed, and democracy against elitism—- it seems to me both impossible and undesirable to be neutral in those conflicts. I do not claim to be neutral, nor do I want to be... . I will try to be fair to opposing ideas by accurately representing them."

A 15 year old female has been the second person to die in &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="avian%20influenza"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt;. The news follows the death of her brother on Sunday. Six people from another Turkish province are also thought to be infected, bringing the total number of suspected cases in Turkey to 18.

It has been revealed by Turkish officials that samples from the boy tested positive to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; strain of bird flu.

The deaths are the first from H5N1 outside of Asia. Around 70 people have died from the virus in the last two years. Of those infected, over half have died.

In an attempt to stop the virus from spreading, the Turkish government have placed five areas of eastern Turkey near Dogubayazit, the affected village, under quarantine. The sale and movement of animals in the region has been banned, livestock is to be kept in enclosed areas, and a hunting ban is also in place in the east.

The Turkish government will make 7m lire (US$5.2m, €4.3m, £3m) available to farmers who surrender their poultry for culling to prevent the virus spreading further.

The &lt;a href="World%20Health%20Organisation"&gt;World Health Organisation&lt;/a&gt; are sending a team of experts to Turkey to determine how best to deal with the outbreak.

Authorities are urging people not to panic and reasssuring them that the outbreak does not mean a pandemic. At this stage, the virus is only transferred to humans from close contact with infected fowl.

Breaking with the scheduled &lt;a href="w%3APatch%20Tuesday"&gt;Patch Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; cycle of bugfix releases, &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; has released an emergency &lt;a href="w%3APatch%20%28computing%29"&gt;patch&lt;/a&gt; to correct the &lt;a href="w%3AWindows%20Metafile%20vulnerability"&gt;Windows Metafile vulnerability&lt;/a&gt; that allows a remote compromise of a computer.

Microsoft has made available patches for all currently supported versions of their Windows operating system. However, the Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, and Windows Millennium Edition versions have not &amp;ndash; at this time &amp;ndash; had patches issued for this vulnerability. According to Microsoft, these versions contain the vulnerable software component but, "the vulnerability is not critical because an exploitable attack vector has not been identified that would yield a Critical severity rating for these versions."

Current versions of Windows, including &lt;a href="w%3AWindows%20XP"&gt;Windows XP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AWindows%20Server%202003"&gt;Windows Server 2003&lt;/a&gt;, depending on configuration, may prompt users to download or install this update automatically for those computers currently connected to the &lt;a href="w%3AInternet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt;. This is the preferred method of protecting your computer from this vulnerability.

Other users are advised to visit &lt;a href="http%3A//www.windowsupdate.com/"&gt;Microsoft Windows Update&lt;/a&gt; to obtain this security patch, if they are unable to obtain the patch or are unsure whether they have it.

Previous methods of protection included unregistering shimgvw.dll to disable handling of Windows MetaFiles, as per Microsoft's security advisory. Since it does not correct the underlying problem, it is unlikely that this method is recommended any longer.

Other methods included &lt;a href="w%3AIlfak%20Guilfanov"&gt;Ilfak Guilfanov&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="http%3A//www.hexblog.com/2005/12/wmf_vuln.html%23more"&gt;unofficial patch&lt;/a&gt;, which was not advised by Microsoft, but served as a measure to mitigate the immediate effects until an official patch was released. Guilfanov has now noted that the patch &lt;a href="http%3A//www.hexblog.com/index.html"&gt;is no longer needed&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>Bill Sweetenham cleared of bullying allegations</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Bill%20Sweetenham%20cleared%20of%20bullying%20allegations&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Australian coach &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Sweetenham"&gt;Bill Sweetenham&lt;/a&gt; has been cleared by an independent inquiry of bullying allegations made last year by former &lt;a href="w%3ABritain"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; table tennis player Matthew Syed. Syed had accused Sweetenham of damaging British swimming and causing the retirement of 13 senior British swimmers.

Sweetenham has been the performance director for British swimming since November 2000, when he took over from Deryk Snelling. His contract, which was recently renewed, runs up till the &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20Olympics"&gt;2008 Olympics&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ABeijing"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;.

Syed's claims had been denied by Sweetenham, British Swimming and many of the swimmers involved. Despite this and the result of the inquiry some of the swimmers maintain that the inquiry was not thorough enough.

The inquiry will be published later in the month when Sweetenham returns from &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;.

The humble beginnings of many popular Web services, such as &lt;a href="Google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALiveJournal"&gt;LiveJournal&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Yahoo%21"&gt;Yahoo!&lt;/a&gt;, are well-documented and available on their websites, and frequently recounted in news stories about the firms. These websites are also scrutinized for any perceived violations of users' privacy or other basic rights.

However, until recently, no investigation had been done into &lt;a href="MySpace"&gt;MySpace&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Facebook"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, two new "social networking" sites of explosive popularity among teenagers and college students. American bloggers, using Google and financial records, have begun investigations into the origins and policies of these sites, making some claims that the site owners explicitly deny.
<h2>Facebook</h2>
Facebook was founded by &lt;a href="Mark%20Zuckerberg"&gt;Mark Zuckerberg&lt;/a&gt;, an individual web developer looking to make friends at &lt;a href="w%3AHarvard%20University"&gt;Harvard University&lt;/a&gt;. Although Facebook has been sued by ConnectU.com for allegedly copying its concept and data, Facebook is actually the first worldwide college network on the Internet. As one of the most popular college websites, Facebook is notable for its lack of prominent advertising. It quickly accumulated $50,000 in debt in 2004, and it took nearly a year for it to begin turning a profit, so clearly it needed a large amount of venture capital.

In August 2005, independent blogger Josh Smith theorized that Facebook could actually be a data-gathering operation. He determined that Facebook received its initial funding from &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Thiel"&gt;Peter Thiel&lt;/a&gt;, which he named as co-author of the book "The Diversity Myth", which argues that "multiculturalism" is used to promote social intolerance on American college campuses. Smith also found that Facebook also received $13 million in funding from "Accel Partners", a firm whose manager James Breyer formerly served as the chairman of In-Q-Tel, a venture capital firm operated by the United States &lt;a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency"&gt;Central Intelligence Agency&lt;/a&gt;.

However, both Accel Partners and Peter Thiel have invested in many dot-com companies. Peter Thiel is the co-founder of &lt;a href="PayPal"&gt;PayPal&lt;/a&gt;, and James Breyer has done extensive work in Silicon Valley. Investigating a firm's sources of venture capital has not often led to breakthrough exposes in the past.

More importantly, Smith discovered clauses in Facebook's current Privacy Policy which state that they "may share your information with third parties, including responsible companies with which we have a relationship". The Privacy Policy also warns that "Facebook also collects information about you from other sources, such as newspapers and instant messaging services. This information is gathered regardless of your use of the Web Site." Other bloggers have also called attention to this ambiguous statement, which seems to point towards a Facebook conspiracy theory. User "timg" at the &lt;a href="w%3AReddit"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; news website noted that "these sites provide possibly the most accurate and easiest to use resource for mining information about groups of people."

According to Chris Hughes, spokesperson for Facebook,

The main issue surrounding Facebook is one of trust. Privacy advocates on the Web are always wary of any website that asks for detailed personal information, and Facebook takes this to the extreme by displaying entire social networks. However, most Facebook users seem to trust it deeply, providing full friends lists, phone numbers, and personal photo albums.

<h2>MySpace</h2>
Trent Lapinski, another blogger, began an investigation into MySpace in July 2005, when it was acquired by &lt;a href="w%3ARupert%20Murdoch"&gt;Rupert Murdoch&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ANews%20Corporation"&gt;News Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, parent company of &lt;a href="w%3AFOX%20News"&gt;FOX News&lt;/a&gt;. MySpace does not often receive criticism about privacy issues, as its users typically do not give out last names or other personal information, but its company history is more interesting. Lapinski was threatened with a lawsuit by MySpace's legal team when he let them know about his investigation, but on January 4, he decided to come forward with the details anyway.

MySpace expressed interest in commenting on this Wikinews article but did not respond by press time.

MySpace's CEO Chris DeWolfe and its most prominent spokesperson Tom Anderson first met in 1999 at Xdrive Technologies, a dot-com startup which gave away free storage space to Internet users. DeWolfe and Anderson went on to work together at ResponseBase, LLC., which was acquired by eUniverse, Inc., which later became Intermix Media. The relationship between these three companies is tangled indeed, and involves the MySpace name itself.
According to Chris DeWolfe, "the general MySpace site" was launched in September 2003. Tom Anderson claims that "MySpace was a creative idea before it was a business." However, long before MySpace became a social networking website, the name MySpace and the domain myspace.com had been used by ResponseBase for their profitable newsletter about "Freebies, Deals, &amp; Discounts", and a free disk space host similar to Xdrive. Newsgroup archives show multiple messages linking to copyrighted files hosted on MySpace. In 2001, MySpace's spokesperson was quoted in an article about "warez". The &lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20Archive"&gt;Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt; has backups of MySpace.com going back to 1999, but these cannot be accessed because MySpace's current owners have blocked the Internet Archive specifically from accessing the site.

One newsgroup message from 2001 documents the transition from MySpace to ResponseBase:

Actually, MySpace had simply shut down and become ResponseBase-- as evidenced by the "Freebies" newsletter above. ResponseBase also used a list of 8 million e-mail addresses purchased from Xdrive for their newsletters. In 2002, ResponseBase was booted from their ISP as an illicit spam organization-- with Tom Anderson himself listed as their billing contact. And later still, ResponseBase would be renamed to MySpace.

In 2002, DeWolfe went on to become a director of "Fog Cutter Capital Group", whose CEO, Andrew Wiederhorn, was convicted of income tax and pension felonies and sentenced to prison. Fog Cutter continued to pay Wiederhorn a salary of $350,000 per month for 18 months while he sat in jail. Wiederhorn's wife, Tiffany Wiederhorn, is on the board of directors at MySpace's parent company Intermix Media.

Intermix Media itself has a tangled history. In 2004, Intermix (then operating as eUniverse) was named as a spammer organization on USENET. It purchased ResponseBase, shut down its operations, and reformed it as MySpace. On April 28, 2005, Intermix was sued by the State of New York for installing malicious spyware over the Internet. According to their press release:

Just before the adware investigation was announced, Intermix's primary investors sold $25,000,000 worth of Intermix stock at roughly $8 per share. When the attorney general announced the investigation, Intermix stock fell to $4 per share. Intermix's former CEO, Brad Greenspan, has accused Intermix investors of insider trading.

Soon afterwards, the spyware issue was settled out of court; Intermix paid $7.5 million to the State of New York.

According to ♡❤The Economist♡❤, "As an internet business, MySpace.com considers itself to be an entirely new breed ... The community has grown virally, with no advertising." However, this leaves one crucial question unanswered: without advertising, how did the site become popular in the first place?

Retired NHL referee Bruce Hood says his high profile may be the reason why he isn’t in the &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AHockey%20Hall%20of%20Fame"&gt;Hockey Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt;.

Speaking Wednesday in an exclusive with HockeyRefs.com, he said: "I was honoured to just be nominated. I have been put on the outside of things because of my speaking out on things I believed in."

Hood officiated in the NHL for 21 seasons before retiring in 1984. His career included 1,033 regular season and 157 Stanley Cup playoff games, three All-Star Games, and three Canada Cups. 

A group of Hall of Fame members headlined by former players Bobby Hall and the late Maurice Richard nominated Hood in 1994, but the effort was unsuccessful. 

Despite that, the former NHLer says he isn’t upset about not being part of the club. 

Hood also discussed the four-official system, the sport’s evolution over the years, and recent controversies involving the NHL Officiating Department. 

"I never liked the two-referee system," he added. "It is absolutely ridiculous for referees to be skating backwards into the zone all the time."

The new &lt;a href="w%3ACBS%20Corporation"&gt;CBS Corporation&lt;/a&gt; began trading on the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Stock%20Exchange"&gt;New York Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt; once again on January 3 after officially finishing its split with &lt;a href="w%3AViacom"&gt;Viacom&lt;/a&gt; two days earlier. The split had been in the works since around March 2005 when Viacom announced it was breaking into two publicly traded companies due to stock price stagnation. 

In June 2005, Viacom's board approved the split and saying the CBS Corporation name would be revived for one of those companies. One of these units would receive most of Viacom's broadcasting and mass-media portion of subsidiaries (CBS, &lt;a href="w%3AUPN"&gt;UPN&lt;/a&gt;, Infinity Broadcasting, now &lt;a href="w%3ACBS%20Radio"&gt;CBS Radio&lt;/a&gt;) along with Viacom Outdoor (now CBS Outdoor), Showtime Networks, and Paramount's television studio and a few other operations and announced long-time excutive &lt;a href="w%3ALeslie%20Moonves"&gt;Leslie Moonves&lt;/a&gt; would head that new company.

The split is filled with twists and turns. &lt;a href="w%3A%20Viacom%20%281971-2005%29"&gt;Viacom&lt;/a&gt; was founded in 1971 as CBS' television syndication division and was spun off in 1973. &lt;a href="w%3AWestinghouse%20Electric%20Corporation"&gt;Westinghouse Electric Corporation&lt;/a&gt; bought CBS and changed its name to CBS Corporation. In a ironic twist, Viacom accquired their parent company in 1999 and CBS' stock symbol was de-listed as it became a division of Viacom. Ironically, the new CBS Corporation is actually the original Viacom. A new Viacom was founded and spun off containing &lt;a href="w%3AMTV%20Networks"&gt;MTV Networks&lt;/a&gt; (which contains &lt;a href="w%3ACMT"&gt;CMT&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASpike%20TV"&gt;Spike TV&lt;/a&gt;, two cable networks originally owned by CBS) along with &lt;a href="w%3ABET"&gt;BET&lt;/a&gt;, Paramount's film studio and home entertainment divisions, online virtual pet game &lt;a href="w%3ANeopets"&gt;Neopets&lt;/a&gt;, and a music publisher. It also partially owns Sega of America along with the Sonic the Hedgehog trademarks and is currently in the process of acquiring DreamWorks.

CBS unveiled its logo, the iconic CBS eye, and launched the corporation's official wesbite, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.cbscorporation.com/"&gt;cbscorporation.com&lt;/a&gt;

<h1>Comedian Jon Stewart to host 78th Academy Awards</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Comedian%20Jon%20Stewart%20to%20host%2078th%20Academy%20Awards&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
American comedian and ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Daily%20Show"&gt;Daily Show&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ anchor &lt;a href="w%3AJon%20Stewart"&gt;Jon Stewart&lt;/a&gt; has been chosen to host the 78th Annual Academy Awards. This is not Stewart's first time hosting an awards show as he hosted the &lt;a href="w%3AGrammys"&gt;Grammys&lt;/a&gt; in 2001 and 2002.

His choice by the &lt;a href="w%3AAcademy%20of%20Motion%20Picture%20Arts%20and%20Sciences"&gt;Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences&lt;/a&gt; shows their continuing attempt to target a younger viewing audience. Last year's host was &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Rock"&gt;Chris Rock&lt;/a&gt;, also a comedian who is popular with young adults, whose performance and jokes at the expense of celebrities irked some Academy members. The Academy has also been seeking an Oscar host with the appeal of popular hosts such as &lt;a href="w%3ABilly%20Crystal"&gt;Billy Crystal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJohnny%20Carson"&gt;Johnny Carson&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Hope"&gt;Bob Hope&lt;/a&gt;.

The choice further demonstrates Stewart's transformation from the host of a cult TV show into a mainstream performer. Stewart is host of ♡❤The Daily Show♡❤, a &lt;a href="w%3Asatire"&gt;satirical&lt;/a&gt; show aired on &lt;a href="w%3AComedy%20Central"&gt;Comedy Central&lt;/a&gt; that parodies network and cable news shows. The show started in 1996, anchored by Stewart's predecessor Craig Kilborn, who left in 1999 to host ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Late%20Late%20Show%20with%20Craig%20Kilborn"&gt;The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. ♡❤The Daily Show♡❤ draws in about 1.4 million viewers nightly. While not a groundbreaking number, sixty-five percent of those viewers are in the 18 to 49 age group, which is the group most coveted by television advertisers.

♡❤The Daily Show♡❤ has become influental in politics and pop culture. Stewart has interviewed many guests from both sides of the political spectrum, including 2004 presidential candidate &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Kerry"&gt;John Kerry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20O%27Reilly"&gt;Bill O'Reilly&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Clinton"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Jimmy%20Carter"&gt;Jimmy Carter&lt;/a&gt;, and has asked for &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; to come on the show, going so far as publish an invitation in a full page newspaper ad during the &lt;a href="w%3A2004%20Republican%20National%20Convention"&gt;2004 Republican National Convention&lt;/a&gt;.

Stewart has interviewed celebrities like &lt;a href="w%3ABruce%20Willis"&gt;Bruce Willis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIce%20Cube"&gt;Ice Cube&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Rock"&gt;The Rock&lt;/a&gt;, and recently interviewed the band &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20White%20Stripes"&gt;The White Stripes&lt;/a&gt; who then did a live studio performance. 

Although ♡❤The Daily Show♡❤ is steeped in satire, its emphasis on political coverage and current events has led to many of its younger viewers regard it as their daily news source, especially during the &lt;a href="w%3A2004%20presidential%20election"&gt;2004 presidential election&lt;/a&gt;. Stewart was even considered as a possible replacement for Dan Rather on the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACBS%20Evening%20News"&gt;CBS Evening News&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ by CBS executive &lt;a href="w%3ALeslie%20Moonves"&gt;Leslie Moonves&lt;/a&gt;, which owned Comedy Central before splitting into two companies just a few days ago.

Although a comedian, Stewart can be serious at times. Notable was his appearance on the &lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; show ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACrossfire"&gt;Crossfire&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ in which he got into a debate with host &lt;a href="w%3ATucker%20Carlson"&gt;Tucker Carlson&lt;/a&gt; over the state of television journalism. He accused ♡❤Crossfire♡❤ of polarizing politics and that it was hurting America, saying "It's not so much that it's bad, as it's hurting America [...] Stop, stop, stop, stop hurting America." He referred to Carlson and co-host &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Begala"&gt;Paul Begala&lt;/a&gt; as "partisan hacks", and said that Carlson was "as big a dick on [his] show as [he is] on any show". Many believe this highly publicized criticizm led to the cancellation of ♡❤Crossfire♡❤.

♡❤The Daily Show♡❤ has won seven &lt;a href="w%3AEmmys"&gt;Emmys&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="w%3APeabody%20Award"&gt;Peabody Award&lt;/a&gt; for their coverage of the 2000 presidential election.

The Academy Awards ceremony will be held on &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Broadcasting%20Company"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt; this year on &lt;a href="w%3AMarch%205"&gt;March 5th&lt;/a&gt;.

For the second time in a row, Team Canada has won the gold medal IIHF World Junior Hockey Championship. In an upset 5&amp;mdash;0 win over Russia the team clinched the title in Vancouver, BC.

Canada was undefeated this year posting a 6 wins and 0 losses record. Going into the competition the United States and Russia were favored for the gold and silver, but a disappointing tie with Switzerland and a loss to Canada during the round-robin knocked the U.S. team from the running

The back-to-back wins are the first since the 1996-1997 wins for team Canada.

Russia won the silver, and Finland won the bronze in an even more surprising and hard fought game against the U.S.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMaori%20King%20Movement"&gt;Maori Queen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATe%20Atairangi%20Kaahu"&gt;Te Arikinui Dame Te Atairangikaahu&lt;/a&gt; is undergoing &lt;a href="w%3Adialysis"&gt;dialysis&lt;/a&gt; treatment the &lt;a href="w%3ATainui"&gt;Tainui Tribe&lt;/a&gt; confirmed today.

The Queen's condition is not believed to be critical, and plans for the celebration in &lt;a href="w%3AMay"&gt;May&lt;/a&gt; of her fortieth &lt;a href="w%3Acoronation"&gt;coronation&lt;/a&gt; anniversary continue.
Taini Rutene; &lt;a href="w%3ATe%20Atairangi%20Kaahu"&gt;Te Arikinui Dame Te Atairangikaahu&lt;/a&gt; private secretary says "Dame Te Ata is undergoing medical treatment for a long-standing illness. There is no immediate concern." 

According to &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, dialysis is a method for removing waste such as &lt;a href="w%3Aurea"&gt;urea&lt;/a&gt; from the blood when the kidneys are incapable of this.

The Maori Queen holds no constitutional function in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href="w%3ATe%20Atairangi%20Kaahu"&gt;Te Arikinui Dame Te Atairangikaahu&lt;/a&gt; is an avid supporter of cultural and sporting events.

<h1>English Wikipedia reaches one million articles</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=English%20Wikipedia%20reaches%20one%20million%20articles&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Today, at 23:09 UTC, the internet encyclopedia &lt;a href="Wikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; reached the point of having over written in English. In comparison, the largest traditional English-language encyclopedia, ♡❤Encyclopædia Britannica♡❤, has 120,000 articles. This milestone marks an important point in Wikipedia's short history.

There was minor confusion over the millionth article; it was first held to be &lt;a href="w%3AJordanhill_railway_station"&gt;Jordanhill Railway Station&lt;/a&gt;, then a brief biography of baseball player &lt;a href="w%3AAaron%20Ledesma"&gt;Aaron Ledesma&lt;/a&gt;. The millionth article was later confirmed to be the former, started by Wikipedia contributor &lt;a href="w%3AUser%3ANach0king"&gt;Nach0king&lt;/a&gt; (Ewan Macdonald). "While I am, of course, delighted at being the one to hit this milestone, I must confess, along with many others I timed my contributions tonight to give me a chance at being the lucky one," he wrote on his Wikipedia user page.

&lt;a href="w%3AJimmy%20Wales"&gt;Jimmy Wales&lt;/a&gt; commented that "We are thrilled that our millionth article in English is about the Jordanhill railway station. This is not something which would appear in a traditional encyclopedia, and it shows how Wikipedia reflects the needs and interests of people everywhere, and not just the dictates of what academics and cultural mavens claim is worthy of an encyclopedia."

<h3>Celebrations</h3>
The milestone was celebrated by a party on the &lt;a href="w%3AFreenode"&gt;Freenode&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AIRC"&gt;IRC&lt;/a&gt; network, where &lt;a href="w%3AWikimedia"&gt;Wikimedia&lt;/a&gt;'s official IRC channels can be found. The milestone was preceded by an announcement to all 30,000 Freenode users, that a separate channel, &lt;a href="irc%3A//irc.freenode.net/wikipedia-countdown"&gt;#wikipedia-countdown&lt;/a&gt;, was being set aside for a celebration. In that channel, an IRC script, ran by &lt;a href="w%3AUser%3AEms2"&gt;Wikipedian ems&lt;/a&gt;, called off the article numbers as they passed by. A total of 733 different people joined the channel over the course of the afternoon. The tension was high when the millionth article was reached; in the first 40 seconds afterwards, chatting was briefly enabled in the channel, and over 3,000 lines of celebratory chat filled the room; chatting had to be disabled until everyone had calmed down.

<h3>About Wikipedia</h3>
Wikipedia was founded in 2001 by Jimmy Wales, the CEO and co-founder of &lt;a href="w%3ABomis"&gt;Bomis, Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ALarry%20Sanger"&gt;Larry Sanger&lt;/a&gt;, an employee of Bomis. Wikipedia began as a complementary project to &lt;a href="w%3ANupedia"&gt;Nupedia&lt;/a&gt;, which was created by Wales to be a free internet encyclopedia. Nupedia was open like Wikipedia but had a much more complex editing system. One day, Sanger made a proposal on the Nupedia mailing list exploring the possibility of a Wiki-based encyclopedia. Out of this proposal, Wikipedia was born. Sanger was appointed editor-in-chief of Wikipedia by Wales, and the project was underwritten by Bomis. Nupedia was eventually scrapped.

Wikipedia has grown immensely in five short years and is no longer under the control of Bomis. The success of Wikipedia and some of the earlier sister projects lead Wales to create a non-profit organization to run them, called the &lt;a href="w%3AWikimedia%20Foundation"&gt;Wikimedia Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. Wikipedia has a user base of around one million registered users and contains over three million pages altogether. It has become one of the world's top 25 websites, as ranked by &lt;a href="w%3AAlexa%20Internet"&gt;Alexa Internet&lt;/a&gt;, and has come to the attention of the media worldwide.

A source of negative publicity for Wikipedia in November 2005 was the John Seigenthaler Sr. &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Seigenthaler%20Sr.%20Wikipedia%20biography%20controversy"&gt;controversy&lt;/a&gt;, in which a then-unknown vandal created a biographical article about Seigenthaler on Wikipedia that contained numerous false and defamatory statements. This article went unnoticed for several months until it was discovered by Victor S. Johnson, Jr., a friend of Seigenthaler's, who brought it to his attention. Another friend corrected the erroneous information. Seigenthaler contacted Wales about the problem and later wrote an op-ed column for ♡❤&lt;a href="USA%20Today"&gt;USA Today&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ about the incident, which led to much unfavorable coverage of Wikipedia. However Wikipedia also experienced some of its strongest growth in usage shortly after his op-ed.

In December 2005, a more positive story about Wikipedia appeared in &lt;a href="w%3ANature%20%28magazine%29"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt; magazine, describing a study that reported Wikipedia's science articles to be slightly less accurate as those in the Encyclopaedia Britannica. 

Since many Wikipedia pages are not articles, the number of articles in Wikipedia depends on how an article is defined. To be counted as an article, a Wikipedia page must be in the article namespace and contain at least one internal link. This definition will include some &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia%3AStub"&gt;stub&lt;/a&gt; articles. The number of articles would be about 8% smaller under the alternative definition that an article must also contain at least 200 characters of text.

The next largest Wikipedia is the German version, which contains over 350,000 articles. Currently there are Wikipedias in 125 different languages, containing 3.3 million articles in total.

&lt;a href="w%3AVirginia"&gt;Virginia’s&lt;/a&gt; outgoing governor and possible 2008 presidential contender &lt;a href="w%3A%20Mark%20Warner"&gt;Mark Warner&lt;/a&gt; ordered on Thursday that &lt;a href="w%3A%20DNA"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt; testing should be performed on &lt;a href="w%3ARoger%20Keith%20Coleman"&gt;Roger Keith Coleman&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3A%20Grundy%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Grundy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AVirginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; man executed in May 1992 for the rape and murder in 1981 of Wanda Fay McCoy. 

The &lt;a href="w%3A%20Capital%20punishment%20in%20the%20United%20States"&gt;death penalty&lt;/a&gt; was re-instated in the United States after a Supreme Court ruling in 1976, reversing its brief suspension from 1973. A total of 1,004 prisoners have been executed since then, but none yet have been posthumously exonerated. That could change if the more precise DNA testing methods available today find Coleman innocent.

Coleman, 33, maintained his innocence to the end, saying "An innocent man is going to be murdered tonight. When my innocence is proven, I hope America will realize the injustice of the death penalty as all other civilized countries have," as his final words before being strapped into the electric chair. 

Governor Warner said regarding the Coleman case, "[that] technology has advanced significantly and can be applied in the case of someone who consistently maintained his innocence until execution… My prayers are with the family of Wanda McCoy as we take this extraordinary step." Coleman's resolute insistence on his innocence drew national attention when he was pictured on the cover of ♡❤TIME♡❤ magazine, focusing attention on capital punishment.

The victim was a 19-year-old housewife and Coleman’s sister-in-law. DNA work done on sperm evidence during the 1990’s found that Coleman was within 2% of the possible population of people who could have committed the crime. Coleman’s execution was allowed to proceed by then governor &lt;a href="w%3ADouglas%20Wilder"&gt;Douglas Wilder&lt;/a&gt;.

The biological evidence used during Coleman's post-conviction appeal process has been under negotiation for months to agree on a proper method to have it re-tested. Four Virginia newspapers and the Centurion Ministries, a &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Jersey"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; organization, asked for the re-testing. The request was denied by the Virginia Supreme Court. With negotiations over the biological evidence successfully concluded, and with a new appeal from the Centurion Ministries to Governor Warner, the testing has begun and may conclude before the end of Warner’s governorship on January 14.

The sperm has been kept frozen at a California laboratory for 15 years. Dr. Blake, the head of the lab, submitted an affidavit attesting to the integrity of the samples. The first set of samples was sent to the &lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20Centre%20of%20Forensic%20Sciences"&gt;Ontario Centre of Forensic Sciences&lt;/a&gt; lab in Toronto on December 15. A second delivery currently is underway.

"We have found that the latest DNA technology&amp;mdash;in certain instances where the other facts of a case support it&amp;mdash;has provided a definitive result not available at the time of trial or post-conviction testing," said Governor Warner.

&lt;a href="w%3AChristian"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt; televangelist &lt;a href="w%3APat%20Robertson"&gt;Pat Robertson&lt;/a&gt; has come under fire for recent comments he made, suggesting that &lt;a href="w%3AIsraeli%20Prime%20Minister"&gt;Israeli Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAriel%20Sharon"&gt;Ariel Sharon&lt;/a&gt;'s recent stroke was "&lt;a href="w%3Adivine%20retribution"&gt;divine retribution&lt;/a&gt;" for pulling Israelis out of the &lt;a href="w%3AGaza%20Strip"&gt;Gaza Strip&lt;/a&gt;. Robertson made the comments on his show, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20700%20Club"&gt;The 700 Club&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, which is produced by Robertson's &lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20Broadcasting%20Network"&gt;Christian Broadcasting Network&lt;/a&gt;.

"God considers this land [Israel] to be His. When you read the Bible, He said 'This is my land.' For any Prime Minister of Israel who decides he will carve it up and give it away, God said, 'No, this is Mine,'" said Robertson. "I would say woe to any prime minister of Israel who takes a similar course to appease the EU, the United Nations, or the United States of America."

Robertson tempered his comments, adding that Sharon is "a very tender-hearted man and a good friend" and that he has prayed alongside the former prime minister. A spokesperson for Robertson said he "expresses his deep sadness over Ariel Sharon’s life threatening stroke and concern for Israel’s future security."

&lt;a href="w%3ABarry%20W.%20Lynn"&gt;Reverend Barry W. Lynn&lt;/a&gt;, director of &lt;a href="w%3AAmericans%20United%20for%20Separation%20of%20Church%20and%20State"&gt;Americans United for Separation of Church and State&lt;/a&gt; didn't agree with Robertson's comment.

"[A religious leader] should not be making callous political points while a man is struggling for his life," said Lynn. "Pat Robertson has a political agenda for the entire world, and he seems to think God is ready to take out any world leader who stands in the way of that agenda."

The &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; immediately distanced itself from Robertson's comments.

"Those comments are wholly inappropriate and offensive and really don't have a place in this or any other debate," said Deputy Press Secretary Trent Duffy during a media gaggle aboard Air Force One.
Angell Watts, a spokesperson for Robertson, who is an ordained minister and bible teacher, said that "Robertson is simply reminding his viewers what the Bible has to say about efforts made to divide the land of Israel."

This isn't the first time Robertson has created rifts among conservatives. In late 2005, he called for the assassination of &lt;a href="w%3AVenezuelan%20President"&gt;Venezuelan President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AHugo%20Ch%C3%A1vez"&gt;Hugo Chávez&lt;/a&gt;. Since this incident, &lt;a href="w%3AABC%20Family"&gt;ABC Family&lt;/a&gt;, which airs ♡❤The 700 Club♡❤ because of a contractual clause, due to the fact the network was part of Robertson's media empire at one time; has began airing a disclaimer before, during and after the program stating, "The views and opinions expressed by ♡❤The 700 Club♡❤ and CBN do not reflect the views of ABC Family." He also has made charged comments regarding the residents of &lt;a href="w%3ADover%2C%20Pennsylvania"&gt;Dover, Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; after a proposal to teach &lt;a href="w%3Aintelligent%20design"&gt;intelligent design&lt;/a&gt; in public schools was defeated.

Robertson says he is a &lt;a href="w%3ASouthern%20Baptist"&gt;Southern Baptist&lt;/a&gt;. He is also a former nominee for the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; party presidential candidate in 1988.

Less than one week out from the inaugural Asia-Pacific Clean Development and Climate Partnership meeting in &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; government has claimed that technology could be used to cut emissions three times more than the &lt;a href="w%3AKyoto%20Protocol"&gt;Kyoto Protocol&lt;/a&gt;.

Ian Macfarlane, Minister for Industry said that the six countries at next week's meeting will discuss ways to cut greenhouse gas emissions while continuing to produce large amounts of energy.

"While Kyoto puddles on, to put it nicely, the real reductions will come from technology" Mr Macfarlane said. "This is not a diplomatic love-in. It's a hard-edged business plan with targets and reporting duties."

The members of the partnership - Australia, the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt; produce around half of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. Of the world's developed nations only Australia and the United States have refused to ratify Kyoto.

The pact will not set binding targets upon its members, but will monitor its results.

It is believed that the meeting will discuss &lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20energy"&gt;nuclear energy&lt;/a&gt; generation, &lt;a href="w%3AGeothermal%20energy"&gt;geothermal energy&lt;/a&gt; and capturing and storing gases underground.

The federal opposition is calling on the Australian government to ratify Kyoto. Environment spokesman, &lt;a href="Anthony%20Albanese"&gt;Anthony Albanese&lt;/a&gt;, said "The Kyoto Protocol is the main game, with mandatory fixed targets for greenhouse gas emission reductions over an extended timetable, with economic instruments driving the policy outcomes".

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Hurricane%20Center"&gt;National Hurricane Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; tonight have announced that the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2005%20Atlantic%20Hurricane%20Season"&gt;2005 Atlantic Hurricane Season&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has ended with the dissipation of Tropical Storm Zeta which became the 27th recorded storm in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAtlantic%20Ocean"&gt;Atlantic Ocean&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the 2005 Atlantic Hurricane Season.

In their final public advisory for the storm, which had weakened to a tropical depression, the National Hurricane Center posted, 

"ZETA AND THE RECORD-BREAKING 2005 ATLANTIC HURRICANE SEASON FINALLY COME TO AN END"&lt;a href="http%3A//www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/prb/al302005.prblty.030.shtml%3F"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The 2005 Atlantic Hurricane Season has proved to be the most active hurricane season ever recorded with 27 storms. A number of records were broken during the season. For example:

<ul>
BULLET::::- Hurricane Dennis became the strongest recorded storm to form in the Atlantic before August.
BULLET::::- Hurricane Emily surpasses Hurricane Dennis as the strongest recorded storm in the Atlantic before August.
BULLET::::- Hurricane Katrina became one of the most costly hurricanes in United States history; however, this is unconfirmed.
BULLET::::- Hurricane Vince became the first tropical cyclone to make landfall in Spain.
BULLET::::- Hurricane Wilma became the most intense hurricane ever recorded.
BULLET::::- Tropical Storm Alpha broke the record for the most recorded storms in once hurricane season. It beat the 1933 hurricane season, which had held the record for 72 years. The National Hurricane Center had used all names available for tropical storms and as a result used the Greek alphabet.
BULLET::::- Hurricane Beta broke the record for the most hurricanes recorded in a season beating the 1969 record of 12 hurricanes.
BULLET::::- Hurricane Epsilon became the first storm since Hurricane Lili in 1984 to reach hurricane strength after the official end of a season.
BULLET::::- Tropical Storm Zeta became the second ever storm to exist in two calendar years.

</ul>
Forecasters are predicting that other hurricane seasons in the future will be just as active or possibly even more active.

Thirty-four &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesian&lt;/a&gt; fisherman have been jailed in &lt;a href="w%3ABroome"&gt;Broome&lt;/a&gt; in northern Western &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; (WA) for illegal fishing offences. Seven of the 34 have been jailed in Australia before for previous fishing offences. 

Their vessels were found hiding in mangroves off the Kimberley coast. The fisherman were found in possession of nearly two tonnes of trochus shell, a shell valued for fashioning into high quality buttons, beads and trinkets. They face jail terms up to a year.

The WA Fisheries Department says the jail terms reflect the seriousness with which the offence is being viewed. Department officer Chris Mitchell says the fishermen had traversed 200 miles of Commonwealth waters and were inside the three nautical mile state limit when they were caught.

He says their actions are a serious breach of fisheries laws. "In the early days, the courts would have given a good behaviour bond for a first offender," he said. "That was more specifically for the traditional sail-powered vessels, not these motorised vessels that are coming down and because these are in state waters it is far more serious."

On Thursday, skippers of 11 Indonesian fishing boats were fined by a Perth court. Three of the men, who had previous convictions, were fined $15,000 each, with 100 days to pay. The remaining eight were fined $9000 each and given 60 days to pay. 

The captains were fined between $9,000 and $15,000 for fishing and taking trochus shell from Australian waters off the north-west coast last month. Three of the captains have been caught fishing in Australian waters before between 1997 and 2004.

Legal Aid lawyer David McKenzie, says the fishermen were very poor and it was highly unlikely they would be able to pay the fines. 

The magistrate ordered that they spend between 60 and 100 days in jail in Western Australia if the fines were not paid.

13 sailors have been reported killed and others missing or injured after suspected Tamil Tiger guerrillas attacked a naval vessel off northeastern Sri Lanka early Saturday. Sri Lankan military say it was one of the worst attacks by the sea Tigers of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).

According to defence officials, the Sri Lankan Navy fast attack craft was sunk in the early hours of Saturday by a heavy explosion carried out by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels.
The Sri Lankan sailors were on patrol when a boat rigged with explosives rammed their vessel off the port of Trincomalee. 

Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC) said two of the injured sailors had been recovered, who were believed to have been thrown out by the power of the explosion.

The LTTE has stepped up attacks against security forces in northern and eastern Sri Lanka since President Mahinda Rajapakse was elected on November 17th and invited the rebels to renew negotiations with the government.

With Saturday's blast, over 65 security personnel and police officers have been killed in rebel attacks since the election.

The attack follows LTTE reports of army abuses and killings. The government is investigating one such incident after five Tamil youths, whom the army said were blown up by their own grenade, were found shot dead.

The Tigers say they want a political solution to the conflict, which has killed more than 64,000 people and displaced hundreds of thousands since 1983. 

A similar attack on the navy in Trincomalee harbour killed 12 sailors and led to the collapse of a previous ceasefire in 1995. 

In December, 39 military personnel were killed in a string of mine attacks, the deadliest month since a 2002 ceasefire that some say is strained to breaking point.

Millions may starve in &lt;a href="w%3AKenya"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASomalia"&gt;Somalia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AEthiopia"&gt;Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ADjibouti"&gt;Djibouti&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Africa"&gt;East Africa&lt;/a&gt;, because of extreme &lt;a href="w%3Adrought"&gt;drought&lt;/a&gt;, combined with inequalities built into mechanisms for distributing food, according to the analysis made by &lt;a href="w%3AAmartya%20Sen"&gt;Amartya Sen&lt;/a&gt;, who was awarded the &lt;a href="w%3ABank%20of%20Sweden%20Prize%20in%20Economic%20Sciences%20in%20Memory%20of%20Alfred%20Nobel"&gt;Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences&lt;/a&gt; in 1998. &lt;a href="w%3AWar"&gt;War&lt;/a&gt; in parts of the region is an extra exacerbating factor.

The countries need immediate food, water, seeds and any other agricultural product, according to the Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), which reports that millions of people are on the brink of starvation due to the recent severe droughts that have been devastating the area.

"The whole area is affected," FAO representative Shukri Ahmed said. "The situation is deteriorating." Local newspaper reports gave an official death toll at 30 famine-related deaths, said Mr Ahmed.

Many had not expected that the area's dry season would be as severe as it has been, and did not anticipate the effects.

Others, such as &lt;a href="w%3AYves%20Engler"&gt;Yves Engler&lt;/a&gt;, expect famines and massive starvation to continue in the region as long as the &lt;a href="w%3AIMF"&gt;IMF&lt;/a&gt; continues to influence economic policies in the region. Yves Engler has claimed, consistently with Amartya Sen's analysis, that the IMF is responsible for worsening or actually creating &lt;a href="w%3Afamine"&gt;famine&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AMalawi"&gt;Malawi&lt;/a&gt; (2002), &lt;a href="w%3AEthiopia"&gt;Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt; (2003) and &lt;a href="w%3ANiger"&gt;Niger&lt;/a&gt; (2005).

The present drought has been said to be getting worse by the day, and the total figure for those who need food from the World Food Program could rise from today's 1.2 million, to exceed 2.5 million people, according to United Nations (UN) spokesman Stephane Dujarric at the organisation's New York headquarters.

The FAO had called for domestic food purchases in areas where harvests were expected to be favorable, coupled with food aid imports elsewhere, the UN's Mr Dujarric said.

Crops have failed, and local attempts at distributing supplies have been blamed on poor infrastructure and a lack of supplies. What makes the region's situation even more grave, is that the rainy season failed to aid in the production of much needed crops.

Nearly one-fifth of the population of Djibouti were said to be facing food shortages and wide-spread starvation. Nearly $40 million is said to be needed to offset the famine. 64,000 tons of food are needed by the World Food Program, but only 16,700 were known to be available. 

The World Food program was trying to assess the worst hit areas.

A woman in &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; has been killed in a shark attack. The attack occurred at 5pm (Local Time) just off Amity Point, &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Stradbroke%20Island"&gt;North Stradbroke Island&lt;/a&gt;, south-east of &lt;a href="w%3ABrisbane"&gt;Brisbane&lt;/a&gt;.

The woman, described as 21, had lost both arms up to the elbow and sustained severe wounds to her torso and legs. She was carried to shore by friends and was then flown by rescue helicopter to the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Brisbane. Surgeons were unable to save her.

The woman was holidaying from Brisbane with a church camp and attempts to contact her family have been made.

Emergency Services Rescue Helicopter crew officer Rod Morgan said the woman had suffered massive blood loss. 

"She was very pale" he said, "We were diverted right away and were able to be on the scene within minutes and were able to have the patient at hospital within an hour of the attack."

"She had life threatening injuries she had lost significant amounts of blood and the patient had what we would call an altered level of consciousness where it wasn't able to communicate directly with the patient" said Queensland Ambulance paramedic Lachlan Parker. 

There were many witnesses at the scene and they are now being interviewed by Police at Amity Point. They are described as being distraught.

One witness, who asks to not be identified, described that the victim was swimming in the sea with her Border Collie. When the attack happened, the dog ran home to raise the alarm.

"I was across the road from where she was staying and I saw the dog come flying up the road all wet and shivering and whimpering," she said, "Then a little boy came running up and said the girl had lost her leg and her arm and everyone ran out of the house towards the beach. It was just a little black-and-white dog but he was crazy so I locked him under the house."

Other reports claim that the woman had been scuba diving in murky shallow water approximately 15 metres from the shore.

The woman is believed to be from McDowall in Brisbane, but her name has not yet been released.

A resident of Amity Point for 20 years, Brad Ross, said tourists visiting the area have been warned of potential attacks; "The shore just falls away into 30m of water and there are plenty of &lt;a href="w%3Abull%20shark"&gt;bull sharks&lt;/a&gt; out there. People know when they enter the water there they're stepping into a shark habitat." 

Other beaches on the island are protected by drum lines.

Queensland state police inspector Peter Harding believes from the severity of the woman's injuries that she was attacked by a group of bull sharks, a species known for aggressive behavior this time of year. Water police will search for the sharks today and as a result, beaches on the east and west of Amity Point have been closed.

This is the first attack in the area since August 1972.

Local wisdom cautions against allowing dogs in the water at swimming beaches, because of a fear that they attract sharks, perhaps because of residue accumulated from fleas which live on the dog's blood.

At least 20 people were injured when a covered stand collapsed during a main parade in the &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ACarnival%20of%20Blacks%20and%20Whites"&gt;Carnival of Blacks and Whites&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AColombia"&gt;Colombian&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3APasto"&gt;Pasto&lt;/a&gt;.

According to the police, the stands were designed to support 500 people, but there were 700 on them. The intense rains might have also contributed to the collapse as the tents had become too heavy.

The &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ARed%20Cross"&gt;Red Cross&lt;/a&gt; immediately helped all those affected. Most people presented minor injures although 3 people had to be referred to medical assistance centers.

Despite the incident the parade continued along the main streets of the city.

Two companies have pleaded guilty to breaching health and safety laws after the stage of The Alexandra Theatre in &lt;a href="w%3ABirmingham"&gt;Birmingham&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; collapsed resulting in injuries ranging from bruises to bone fractures in 30 people.

The two companies, Sing Along Productions and Clear Channel, said that the collapse occurred after a communications breakdown between them.

During the production of Sing-Along-A-Sound-of-Music, members of the audience in costume had climbed onto the stage to participate in a song when the stage fell into the orchestra pit 20 feet below.

The case has been sent to Birmingham Crown Court for sentencing. The case was brought to Birmingham Magistrates Court by Birmingham City Council under health and safety legislation.

Just two weeks after a join statement by &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; federal roads minister Jim Lloyd and his &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; counterpart Joe Tripoldi that tolls may be used to fast track upgrades of the &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Highway%20%28Australia%29"&gt;Pacific Highway&lt;/a&gt;, acting Prime Minister Mark Vaile suggested that truck operators could pay up to a $70 toll.

Mr Vaile claims that industry sources claim that it is $400 less for a B-double semi trailer to drive from Sydney to Brisbane via the Pacific Highway than the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20England%20Highway"&gt;New England Highway&lt;/a&gt; (which is the national highway) because of the upgrades carried out over the past 10 years.

Mr Valie claims the transport industry would accept a $70 toll. "Anything we do is going to enhance their efficiency". "Therefore the transport industry would be prepared to pay a toll - not just a $5 or $7 or $10 toll. For Sydney to Brisbane, who knows, (they could pay) a $50 to $70 toll, because these efficiencies are so significant now in running that sector."

The federal and state governments have committed to converting the highway to dual carriageway between &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APort%20Macquarie"&gt;Port Macquarie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABrisbane"&gt;Brisbane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AByron%20Bay"&gt;Byron Bay&lt;/a&gt; within three years. The remainder of the highway (with the exception of the section replaced by the &lt;a href="w%3ASydney-Newcastle%20Freeway"&gt;Sydney - Newcastle Freeway&lt;/a&gt; was scheduled to be completed by 2016.

Mr Vaile said that the New South Wales government should look at using public-private partnerships to fund upgrades between Port Macquarie and Byron Bay. He further hinted that regular motorists would still pay tolls, although they would be variable depending on the length of highway used.

Kathy and Greg Campbell who lost Greg's mother and their daughters Becky, 9, and Jessy, 8, when a truck slammed into their car head on south of Buladelah said the number of trucks which use the single carriageway section is an outrage. Ms Campbell said that the federal government received AU$14 billion a year in fuel excise from motorists and the estimated cost to complete the highway upgrade was AU$8 billion.

Martin Dinnes, the owner of Dinnes Memorial Veterinary Hospital, alleges that &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Jackson"&gt;Michael Jackson&lt;/a&gt; owes him over $91,602 in veterinary bills.

The pop star's exotic animals were looked after by the veterinarian at the Neverland ranch, where Jackson has not lived in since the last &lt;a href="w%3A2005%20trial%20of%20Michael%20Jackson"&gt;child molestation trial in June 2005.&lt;/a&gt;

Dinnes helped Michael acquire animals for his zoo which include flamingoes, giraffes, elephants and orangutans.

His lawyer, Brenton Horner, stated that Dinnes filed this lawsuit with great reluctance. "He has a lot of admiration for Michael. This is just a business matter."

A hearing was set for May 2.

The paper "Guidelines for a space propulsion device based on Heim's quantum theory" by &lt;a href="w%3AWalter%20Dr%C3%B6scher"&gt;Walter Dröscher&lt;/a&gt; (Austrian patent officer; retired) and &lt;a href="w%3AJochen%20H%C3%A4user"&gt;Jochem Häuser&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Applied%20Sciences%20in%20Salzgitter%2C%20Germany"&gt;University of Applied Sciences in Salzgitter, Germany&lt;/a&gt;; Physicist &amp; Professor of Computer Science) has won an &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Institute%20of%20Aeronautics%20and%20Astronautics"&gt;American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA)&lt;/a&gt; annual award for the best papers presented at its conferences (nuclear and future flight category).

The paper proposes experiments aimed at using intense magnetic fields to produce a gravitational field, which then propels a space craft. The work is based upon ideas developed by &lt;a href="w%3ABurkhard%20Heim"&gt;Burkhard Heim&lt;/a&gt; in the 1950s. &lt;a href="w%3AHeim%20theory"&gt;Heim's theories&lt;/a&gt; are not widely accepted in the physics community. They do, however, pass many experimental tests, such as accurately predicting masses of fundamental particles within current experimental limits. 

Dröscher says Heim's theories predict two additional forces, one is a repulsive anti-gravity consistent with the &lt;a href="w%3Adark%20energy"&gt;dark energy&lt;/a&gt; that appears to be causing the universe's expansion to accelerate, and one capable of producing acceleration of a spacecraft without expending mass, i.e. rocket fuel. &lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; has investigated possible anti-gravity applications of Heim's theories before, but Dröscher &amp; Häuser say their proposed experiments differ significantly.

The &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Air%20Force"&gt;U.S. Air Force&lt;/a&gt; has expressed interest in the idea. Experiments are expected to proceed if the idea survives further scrutiny in the physics community.

&lt;a href="w%3APat%20Robertson"&gt;Pat Robertson&lt;/a&gt;, founder of the &lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20Broadcasting%20Network"&gt;Christian Broadcasting Network&lt;/a&gt; and outspoken &lt;a href="w%3Atelevangelist"&gt;televangelist&lt;/a&gt;, has once again created political waves after saying that Israeli Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AAriel%20Sharon"&gt;Ariel Sharon&lt;/a&gt; suffered a massive &lt;a href="w%3Astroke"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt; because he tried to "divide God’s land."

The comment was made during Robertson’s &lt;a href="w%3A700%20Club"&gt;700 Club&lt;/a&gt; program last week. Robertson said that Sharon’s stroke was a punishment from God. 

&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20White%20House"&gt;The White House&lt;/a&gt; quickly blasted the comment, and distanced itself from Robertson. 

"I think [Robertson’s] comments were wholly inappropriate and offensive, and really don't have a place in this or any other debate," said Deputy Press Secretary &lt;a href="w%3ATrent%20Duffy"&gt;Trent Duffy&lt;/a&gt; during a press gaggle aboard &lt;a href="w%3AAir%20Force%20One"&gt;Air Force One&lt;/a&gt; on Friday.

Duffy also said that President Bush continues to pray for the Israeli leader, who many say is the region’s best chance for peace. 

"The President spoke about him yesterday and what a historic figure he is, as far as bringing peace to the Middle Eastern region. And our thoughts and prayers continue to be with him," said Duffy. 

Numerous religious figures around the world spoke out against Robertson’s comments, saying that the comments are not consistent with Christian beliefs. 

Former US Presidential Candidate &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Kerry"&gt;John Kerry&lt;/a&gt; also criticized Robertson, saying that the commentator ignored the risks Sharon took to bring peace to Israel. 

"It is beyond shocking to think that as Prime Minister Sharon fights for his life, Pat Robertson would attack his character," said Kerry. "Perhaps we shouldn't be surprised to hear such venom from someone who claimed Hurricane Katrina was punishment for the people of New Orleans."

&lt;a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Tom%20DeLay"&gt;Tom DeLay&lt;/a&gt;, representative from the 22nd Congressional District of &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, announced on Saturday that he will not attempt to reclaim his &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMajority%20Leader%20of%20the%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;majority leader&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; position in the &lt;a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;United States House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;. Fellow Republicans, spear-headed by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJeff%20Flake"&gt;Jeff Flake&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="Arizona"&gt;AZ&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href="w%3A%20Melissa%20Hart"&gt;Melissa Hart&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="Pennsylvania"&gt;PA&lt;/a&gt;), began circulating a petition last week urging to elect a new majority speaker, thus setting the stage for House leadership elections.

In a letter written and addressed to fellow House Republicans on Saturday, DeLay said, "During my time in Congress, I have always acted in an ethical manner within the rules of our body and the laws of our land."

He asked &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASpeaker%20of%20the%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;Speaker of the House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADennis%20Hastert"&gt;Dennis Hastert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to convene a body to elect a new majority leader. "I cannot allow our adversaries to divide and distract our attention," wrote DeLay.

The 58-year-old DeLay held the leadership post for 3 years, until he was forced to relinquish it in late 2005 after he became involved in an ethics scandal. He stepped down after a Texas jury indicted him for money laundering and conspiracy, but initially planned to re-seek the majority speaker post if he was acquitted.

On Sunday, an earthquake rocked the country of &lt;a href="w%3AGreece"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt; early in the afternoon. 

Seismographs have recorded the earthquake as a 6.7 (estimated) on the &lt;a href="w%3ARichter%20Scale"&gt;Richter Scale&lt;/a&gt;. There are only reports of minor damage at the island of Kythira, including 3 injuries. 

The earthquake took place at 1:34 pm local time (1134 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;) and was felt, according to locals, throughout Greece and as far away as Cairo, Egypt, and the coasts of Jordan. This is unusual, as previous major quakes in the highly-seismic Mediterranean country have been limited to a relatively small region. 

The quake's epicenter was located about 200 kilometers (125 miles) south of Athens near Kythira, the US Geological Survey institute said. Amending its previous report of a magnitude of 6.4, the USGS, based in Colorado, and the National Earthquake Information Center in Denver gave a preliminary magnitude of 6.7, However, the Thessaloniki Aristotelion University's Seismology Laboratory and the Patras seismic monitoring station have recorded the quake at a magnitude 6.9. 

Aftershocks have been recorded near the epicentre, however were not as powerful as the original earthquake.

A witness in Athens at the time of the quake described the general mood as calm.

More than 100 people died following an earthquake in Athens, Greece, in 1999.

Birmingham Central Mosque in the Highgate area of &lt;a href="w%3ABirmingham"&gt;Birmingham&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; was burgled and set on fire early Saturday morning.

Emergency services arrived within a matter of minutes after smoke was reported billowing from the building. The mosque was empty at the time, resulting in no injuries.

Damage is said to be confined to an office. &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Midlands%20Police"&gt;West Midlands Police&lt;/a&gt; say an investigation is now being coordinated.

The 55 year old Samuel Alito has served as a federal appeals court judge for 15 years, and previously served as a lawyer for the Reagan administration.

His lengthy track record of more than 700 judicial opinions includes several writings on abortion-rights, among other issues, including states’ rights, first amendment rights, police rights, and the separation of church and state.

The Brazilian General &lt;a href="w%3AUrano%20Teixeira%20da%20Matta%20Bacellar"&gt;Urano Teixeira da Matta Bacellar&lt;/a&gt;, military chief of the &lt;a href="w%3AMINUSTAH"&gt;United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti&lt;/a&gt; (MINUSTAH) died in the morning of January 7, in his &lt;a href="w%3APort-au-Prince"&gt;Port-au-Prince&lt;/a&gt; hotel room. 

Early speculations that the commander had committed suicide were supported both by a recently published UN report, and by a separate Brazilian police investigation. Bacellar had been placed in charge of the mission in August 2005, replacing General Augusto Heleno Ribeiro Pereira.

Since Bacellar's death, the post was run by a Chilean general. Carlos dos Santos, the director of the UN Information Center in Brazil, told Agência Brasil that a new commander is presumed to be named no later than next week.

The UN Department of Peace Operations, along with Kofi Annan and advisors, are evaluating which of the two nominees are best suited to the position.

The first &lt;a href="w%3ATropical%20cyclone"&gt;tropical cyclone&lt;/a&gt; of the 2006 Southern Hemisphere cyclone season is off the coast of &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20Australia"&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt; and is predicted to cross land around 9:00PM West Australian Time (1:00PM UTC).

Cyclone Clare has been upgraded to a category three storm by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. Earlier today it was feared that Claire could be become a category four storm as it gets closer to land. The Bureau of Meteorology warned that if it became category four it could bring winds up to 240 km/h.

Current warnings are for "very destructive winds with gusts to 195 kilometres per hour are expected in the Dampier, Karratha and Mardie areas this evening", according to the Bureau of Meteorology.

Warnings for 150 km/h winds are current inland to Pannawonica.

A number of communties along the coastline are already being battered by strong winds. Neil Bennet, senior forecaster for the Bureau of Meteorology said "We've been looking at gusts around the 80-knot mark, which is roughly 150 to 160 kilometres an hour, being reported from the Dampier area".

At 6:00PM West Australian Time (10:00AM UTC), the cyclone was 65 km North of Karratha and moving South-East at 18 km/h. 

Forecasters predict that Clare will hit the &lt;a href="w%3APilbara"&gt;Pilbara&lt;/a&gt; region between Dampier and Mardie.

Around 1,500 people in low lying areas of Karratha, Dampier, Roebourne, Wickham and Point Samson have been evacuated by State Emergency Service personnel.

"We are asking people ... to basically put an emergency kit of essential items together with them, things like food and water to last 48 hours, medicines, clothes and then just important personal documents, such as passports, wills and any other really essential items" said SES spokesperson Nita Gill.

"Most people who are on higher ground, so long as their home's prepared and sturdy and they're ready, they often will just wait out the cyclone in their home" Ms Gill said.

Australia's two largest ports - Dampier and Port Hedland have been closed. The ports export more than 200 million tonnes of iron ore and liquefied natural gas each year.

Major industries in the area have also closed.

The Bureau of Meteorology warns residents of Karratha and Dampier that a dangerous &lt;a href="w%3AStorm%20surge"&gt;storm surge&lt;/a&gt; may occur causing damaging waves and flooding as the cyclone crosses land. Widespread heavy rain and flooding is likely in the Pilbara and Gascoyne over the next few days.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHonda"&gt;Honda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHonda%20Civic"&gt;Civic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and Ridgeline truck won the North American Car and Truck of the Year awards at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Auto%20Show"&gt;International Auto Show&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADetroit"&gt;Detroit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . This is the first time a company has won both awards in the same year. The finalists were the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHonda%20Ridgeline"&gt;Ridgeline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFord"&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFord%20Explorer"&gt;Explorer SUV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANissan"&gt;Nissan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANissan%20Xterra"&gt;Xterra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The awards are intended to recognize vehicles for their innovation, design, safety, handling, driver satisfaction, and value. &lt;span style="display:none"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Honda also unveiled its latest model the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHonda%20Fit"&gt;Fit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a US version of the Honda Jazz sold in nonUS markets. The Fit comes with a 109 horsepower engine, antilock brakes, six air bags, fold flat seats, full &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AiPod"&gt;iPod&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; connectivity, 90.1 cubic feet of passenger and cargo space, and 33 mpg for the city 38 mpg for the highway. A sport package will also include Honda's first steering wheel mounted paddle shifters. The car will go against another two new Japanese subcompacts, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AToyota"&gt;Toyota&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AToyota%20Yaris"&gt;Yaris&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Nissan &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANissan%20Versa"&gt;Versa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and will have to wrestle away sales from the category's current top seller &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChevrolet"&gt;Chevrolet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChevrolet%20Aveo"&gt;Aveo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . 

The car will start selling in April for around $13,000 to $14,000 as a 2007 model. The company plans to sell 33,000 units of the hatchback in 2006.

Many automakers expect industry wide sales in the US to be between 16 and 17 million units. Honda, which is Japan's third largest automaker, hopes to gain US market share with the redesigned Civic and the Fit. Honda hopes that the company's auto sales will rise 4% this year. The fuel-efficient Civic helped increase US market share to 8.6 percent last year, some of those sales were taken from Ford as gas prices rocketed to $3 a gallon. The US market is extremely important for Honda as it receives 64% of its operating profit from the US.

&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; electricity generator and retailer &lt;a href="w%3ATrustPower"&gt;TrustPower&lt;/a&gt; said today that it is considering a &lt;a href="w%3AWind%20farm"&gt;wind farm&lt;/a&gt; development at &lt;a href="w%3ALake%20Mahinerangi"&gt;Lake Mahinerangi&lt;/a&gt;, south of &lt;a href="w%3ADunedin"&gt;Dunedin&lt;/a&gt;, in the lower &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Island"&gt;South Island&lt;/a&gt; of New Zealand. In a development which could be worth up to NZ$500 million (US$347 million), to the Otago region according to TrustPower chief executive, Keith Tempest.

TrustPower said in a statement that the 300 megawatts wind farm, built in three 100 megawatts installments, could eventually provide enough electricity to power 150,000 homes and that it will be a world class installation that will guarantee security of electricity for the region.

According to Tempest "A windfarm development at Mahinerangi would enable us to better utilise the hydro storage available behind our Waipori scheme," Lake Mahinerangi is also the site of TrustPower's largest hydro lake.

TrustPower expects to apply for environmental consents under &lt;a href="w%3AResource%20Management%20Act"&gt;Resource Management Act&lt;/a&gt; later in the year if engineering reports prove the site satisfactory. 
After the announcement TrustPower’s shares remained unchanged at NZ$6.16. (US$4.26)

Currently the largest windfarm in New Zealand is operating at &lt;a href="w%3ATe%20Apiti"&gt;Te Apiti&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AManawatu"&gt;Manawatu&lt;/a&gt;; producing 90 megawatts of electricity. NZ Power companies are seeking to have resource consent procedures simplified for smaller-scale windfarms.

Doctors are awakening Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon out of a drug induced coma to asess the damage to his brain from a major stroke. Doctors reported that he has started to move some limbs and is breathing spontaneously on his own, but say that he is still on a respirator and still in critical condition. "In a test of (his reaction) to pain, we noticed that Prime Minister Ariel Sharon slightly moved his right arm and right leg," said Dr. Shlomo Mor-Yosef, director of Jerusalem's Hadassah hospital. "The process of waking him out of the coma could take anywhere from several hours to several days" said Mor-Yosef.

Sharon's blood pressure rose slightly during stimulation which doctors call "a postive sign". Dr Felix Umansky, the chief neurosurgeon treating Sharon, said “Once he talks to us ... and there are no other infections I will be willing to say that he is completely out of danger."

Although he is moving and breathing spontaneously on his own, this does not give any indication as to his other physical or mental capacities.

Sharon was rushed to the hospital on Wednesday after "feeling unwell". Doctors later determined that he had a major stroke.

According to city transport officials, a vagrant had left a coat on the bus and an investigation by police had revealed this not to be a threat.

The evacuation, it was stressed, was purely a precautionary measure.

Two suspects, believed to be responsible for a killing spree that started on New Year's day in the &lt;a href="w%3ARichmond%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Richmond&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AVirginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; area, were apprehended in &lt;a href="w%3APhiladelphia%2C%20Pennsylvania"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APennsylvania"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday where they were held on charges of conspiracy to commit murder and auto theft. The two declined to fight extradition to Virginia and were flown into the Richmond International Airport Monday afternoon.

Police believe the total of seven victims from two different crime scenes were linked, as both groups were bound with duct tape prior to their being brutally murdered. The suspects, both 28-year-olds, are Ray Joseph Dandridge and Ricky Gevon "Cooley" Gray.

The initial incident took place on New Year's day when all four members of the Harvey family were discovered in their basement bound by tape and with their throats slit. &lt;a href="w%3AJohnny%20Hott"&gt;Johnny Hott&lt;/a&gt;, a family friend, had discovered a fire at the Harvey's home as he arrived for a 2pm family and friends chili party gathering to ring in the new year that Sunday. Emergency crews responded to a 911 call and put out the fire, which at that point had only caused moderate damage, and then discovered Bryan Harvey, 49, his wife Kathryn, 39, and their two children Stella, 9, and Ruby, 4. Harvey was a musician who achieved some airplay while in the 1980s duo &lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20of%20Freaks"&gt;House of Freaks&lt;/a&gt;, and his wife was a well-known Richmond toy store owner who also happened to be the half sister of &lt;a href="w%3ASteven%20Culp"&gt;Steven Culp&lt;/a&gt; who played &lt;a href="w%3ARex%20Van%20De%20Kamp"&gt;Rex Van De Kamp&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="w%3ADesperate%20Housewives"&gt;Desperate Housewives&lt;/a&gt;. 

Police initially believed the Harvey family murders were committed by someone close to the family. But as later events unfolded in nearby &lt;a href="w%3AChesterfield%20County%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Chesterfield County&lt;/a&gt;, a more random picture emerged. 

A witness reported that a white van was parked outside the Harvey residence where a woman identified as 21-year-old Ashley Baskerville was said to be inside it at the time of the murders. 

Then two days later, on Tuesday at the Goolsby residence, a relative speaking for the shaken victims of a separate home-invasion robbery said that the Baskerville woman was with two men who forced their way into the home and robbed them of a computer, television, DVD player and money.

Ultimately, Ashley Baskerville was found dead on Friday, bound with duct tape and murdered at her parent’s residence along with her mother Mary Tucker, 47 and step-father Percyell Tucker, 55. That residence is located no more than 3 miles from the Harvey residence.
The white van believed to have been the one spotted in front of the Harvey residence was recovered at the Tucker home. A green Chevrolet Blazer was taken by Dandridge and Gray to travel to west Philadelphia where they arrived some time on Friday afternoon at the home of Dandridge's father. The two were arrested there by a &lt;a href="w%3ASWAT"&gt;SWAT&lt;/a&gt; team.

Police are also interested in any possible connection the two might have with the murder of Gray’s wife. The body of Treva Gray was found on November 5 southwest of Pittsburgh, in the town of Washington, Pennsylvania. Her murder occurred less than two weeks after Dandridge's release of from prison. 

Dandridge was released from &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20River%20Correctional%20Center"&gt;James River Correctional Center&lt;/a&gt; November 2005 after serving a ten year prison sentence for robbery. Gray is Dandridge's uncle, and believed to be from Arlington, in &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Virginia"&gt;Northern Virginia&lt;/a&gt;.

Lower &lt;a href="w%3Aoil"&gt;oil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Anatural%20gas"&gt;natural gas&lt;/a&gt; prices and a &lt;a href="w%3AGeneral%20Motors"&gt;General Motors&lt;/a&gt; (GM) upgrade sent the &lt;a href="w%3ADow%20Jones%20Industrial"&gt;Dow Jones Industrial&lt;/a&gt; above the 11,000 mark for the first time since before September 11, 2001. The last time the Dow was above eleven thousand was June 13, 2001 when it closed at 11,012.40 before retreating slightly. The Dow's alltime record was set back on January 14, 2000 when it closed at 11,722.98.

The impact of the Dow even getting to 11,000 is "psychological and hard to measure, but clearly you can't dismiss it," said Hugh Johnson, chairman of asset management company Johnson Illington Advisors. "If it wakes up investors then it is of some value."

General Motors (up $1.09 to $21.89) was the Dow's biggest gainer, up five percent, after &lt;a href="w%3AGoldman%20Sachs"&gt;Goldman Sachs&lt;/a&gt; raised its rating on the automaker.

&lt;a href="w%3ASirius%20Radio"&gt;Sirius Radio&lt;/a&gt; also added to the Dow's gain, up nearly 2 percent (to $6.65) as &lt;a href="w%3AHoward%20Stern"&gt;Howard Stern&lt;/a&gt; made his debut on the satellite waves.

Oil prices, although still high, fell $1.21 to $63.05 a barrel.

<h1>Cyclone Clare batters Western Australia</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Cyclone%20Clare%20batters%20Western%20Australia&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The eye of Cyclone Clare, a category three storm hit the &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20Australia"&gt;Western Australian&lt;/a&gt; coastline at 11PM AWST on Monday (3PM Monday UTC).

Cyclone Clare crossed the coast 100Km north of &lt;a href="w%3AKarratha%2C%20Western%20Australia"&gt;Karratha&lt;/a&gt;, battering the &lt;a href="w%3A%20Pilbara%20region%20of%20Western%20Australia"&gt;Pilbara region&lt;/a&gt; with winds up to 195 km/h.

Initially it was predicted that the storm would hit the coast at around 9PM local time, but the storm slowed from 18 to 12 km/h delaying its arrival for two hours.

A large storm surge had been predicted, but forecasters say it is unlikely to eventuate. The sea is predicted to swell by only two to three metres.

Reports from the area advise that electricity supply has failed, but there has been no major structural damage to buildings and no injuries. Crews are assessing damage in Karratha and &lt;a href="w%3ADampier%2C%20Western%20Australia"&gt;Dampier&lt;/a&gt; following Clare. Work teams are in the process of restoring electricity and telephone services.

Earlier today residents of Karratha and Dampier were advised to stay indoors due to flying debris caused by strong winds and the possibility of power lines being down. This advisory has since been lifted. The Bureau of Meteorology has advised residents to "proceed with caution".

As the storm moves inland it continues to lose strength, being downgraded to a category two storm earlier today (10:00AM AWST) when it neared the town of &lt;a href="w%3APannawonica%2C%20Western%20Australia"&gt;Pannawonica&lt;/a&gt;. Winds were up to 140 km/h. The storm has since been downgraded again, to a category one storm.

The main concern now is for flooding due to heavy rain.

Lynne Nanini from Main Roads's Pilbara office said the rain that follows may be more troublesome than the cyclone itself.

"We're mainly concerned about any rainfall that may eventuate out of Tropical Cyclone Clare and as in the past, a few cyclones that we've had, most of our damage is actually caused by flooding." she said.

President Bush signed legislation last Thursday that disallows the posting or e-mailing of messages intended to annoy people without having included your true identity. The law, ♡❤Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005♡❤, contained this as a rider. The relevant portion of the law is as follows:

&lt;a href="Clinton%20Fein"&gt;Clinton Fein&lt;/a&gt;, owner of ♡❤Annoy.com♡❤ &lt;a href="http%3A//annoy.com/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which allows people to send anonymous annoying messages, reported to CNET that "I'm certainly not going to close the site down. I would fight it on First Amendment grounds." Previous Supreme Court precedent does allow for anonymous, written annoyance.

The self-proclaimed "King of All Media", "shock jock" &lt;a href="w%3AHoward%20Stern"&gt;Howard Stern&lt;/a&gt; made his debut on &lt;a href="w%3ASirius%20Satellite%20Radio"&gt;Sirius Satellite Radio&lt;/a&gt;, being introduced by the new official announcer, actor &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Takei"&gt;George Takei&lt;/a&gt;. yesterday with liberal use of profanity. Stern made the deal last year to jump to Sirius after increasing pressure from the government, due to fallout after the &lt;a href="w%3ASuper%20Bowl%20XXXVIII%20halftime%20controversy"&gt;Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime controversy&lt;/a&gt;.

Stern said, "I don't compete on terrestrial radio anymore." Satellite radio is not regulated by the United States government as it is a subscriber service.

In his deal with Sirius, Stern gets two channels, "&lt;a href="w%3AHoward%20100"&gt;Howard 100&lt;/a&gt;" and "Howard 101". The channels launched in October 2005 under the names "Douche 100" and "Douche 101," filled with mostly dead air. However, due to his contract to former employer, Infinity Broadcasting (now &lt;a href="w%3ACBS%20Radio"&gt;CBS Radio&lt;/a&gt;), at the time he could not broadcast on them, so he filled up the time with 24-hour marathons of Wack Pack members until his contract expired on New Year's Day. That day, Stern did a commercial free segment on his two stations, playing clips from his days as a child, to working at WTBU (Boston University college radio), WCCC, W4, WWDC, WNBC, and WXRK. Then on January 3 and 5, Stern and his team did live test broadcasts, listeners did call in during the tests, Stern told them that these were test broadcasts and that debut show would be on January 9.

Stern began his career in his family's basement, making tapes of fictional radio programs. He then moved into real broadcasting when he began a show at WTBU, Boston University's college radio station. He then moved on to Hartford's WCCC, followed by WWWW (W4), before landing a job at DC-101, WWDC, there his morning show became a big hit but was fired for criticizing the station. A notable incident happened the day after the crash of Air Florida Flight 90. He called Air Florida asking how much a one-way trip from the Washington National Airport to the 14th Street Bridge would cost. He then moved to New York's WNBC-AM were he had an overnight program (since Don Imus had the morning show). WNBC management attemepted to control Stern but not to much success he was eventually fired before WXRK "K-Rock" picked him up and where history was made from then on.

With the departure of Stern, K-Rock and some other stations have switched to a francished format know as Free FM. CBS Radio also replaced Stern with &lt;a href="w%3AVan%20Halen"&gt;Van Halen&lt;/a&gt; guitarist &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Lee%20Roth"&gt;David Lee Roth&lt;/a&gt; on the East Coast, comedic radio personality &lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20Corrolla"&gt;Adam Corrolla&lt;/a&gt; on the West Coast and a lesser-known DJ know as Rover.

Archbishop &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWilliam%20Joseph%20Levada"&gt;William Joseph Levada&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who was the &lt;a href="Roman%20Catholicism"&gt;Roman Catholic&lt;/a&gt; Archbishop of &lt;a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Oregon"&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt; from 1986 to 1995, was deposed in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on January 9. Levada was questioned by the plaintiffs in a lawsuit seeking damages from the Archdiocese of Portland for sexual abuse allegedly performed by priests in the archdiocese. The archdiocese filed for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Abankruptcy"&gt;bankruptcy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; protection days before the trial was set to begin.

Levada, one of the highest ranking Americans in the &lt;a href="Vatican"&gt;Vatican&lt;/a&gt;, was the Archbishop of San Francisco from 1995 to 2005, when he was appointed to succeed &lt;a href="Pope%20Benedict%20XVI"&gt;Pope Benedict XVI&lt;/a&gt; as Prefect of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACongregation%20for%20the%20Doctrine%20of%20the%20Faith"&gt;Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Levada was served with a subponea to testify in this case last August, immediately before leaving the United States to assume his new duties in Rome. When Levada arrived at the deposition, he was served another subponea, to testify in an abuse case involving the Archdiocese of San Francisco. 

Michael Morey, an attorney for the plaintiffs, stated, "We expect to find out what he knows and when he knew it." The plaintiffs are seeking over $150 million in damages. Kelly Clark, another plaintiff attorney, stated, "We are trying to prove that the Archdiocese of Portland, over the last 40 years, had a policy and practice of responding to child abuse claims in a less-than-appropriate manner." Judge Elizabeth Perris barred attorneys from asking Levada about his current position, or his activities when serving at the Congration during the late 1970s and early 1980s.

A federal bankruptcy judge ruled on December 30 that parish and school assests of the Portland Archdiocese can be used to pay claims and other debts of the archdiocese. The archdiocese had argued that the assets were not under its control, and therefore not available to settle the claims.

Early Monday morning, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVice%20President"&gt;Vice President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADick%20Cheney"&gt;Dick Cheney&lt;/a&gt; was taken to George Washington University Hospital after he reported having shortness of breath. 

Tests on the Vice President indicated that his symptoms weren't related to his extensive history of heart disase, a White House spokesperson said. Doctors eventually determined that he was "retaining fluid as a result of anti-inflammatory medication he has been taking for a foot problem," and was prescribed a &lt;a href="w%3Adiuretic"&gt;diuretic&lt;/a&gt;. He was released from the hospital around 7:30am, and returned to work on Monday afternoon after resting at his home.

Doctors say that an anti-inflammatory prescribed to him for an operation on his foot may have played a role in the health scare. He was seen Friday using a cane. 

Cheney has had a history of heart-related issues for several years and recently had a pacemaker implanted.

Early media reports got it wrong in the case of a &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Mexico"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt; man's house that burnt down after he tried to destroy a mouse he caught by burning it in a trash fire behind his home.

The wacky story was picked up by news agencies reporting that the burning mouse escaped the fire and scurried back into the home of Luciano Mares, aged 81, of &lt;a href="w%3AFort%20Sumner%2C%20New%20Mexico"&gt;Fort Sumner&lt;/a&gt;. The mouse allegedly caused a window curtain to ignite, and the fire spread to engulf the entire home. 

Mares later indicated this was untrue. However, the bonfire did spread to the wooden house, which was completely destroyed as a result, according to local fire officials.

In December 2005, MySpace members discovered that mentions and links to content hosted by rival video-swapping site &lt;a href="w%3AYouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; were disabled. Debate concerning this issue was apparently even stifled on the site's message boards. Regardless, member unrest grew, culminating in a campaign led by 600 MySpace members to boycott and relocate to rival sites such as &lt;a href="w%3AFriendster"&gt;Friendster&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALinkedIn"&gt;LinkedIn (linkedin.com)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARevver"&gt;Revver&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AFacebook"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. Subsequently, MySpace reenabled the YouTube links and content in late December. However, it appears that MySpace also closed down a blog forum where members were complaining about this issue. 

MySpace was also apparently banning &lt;a href="w%3ARevver"&gt;Revver&lt;/a&gt;, another video swapping site, but had relented as of early January. To this, Revver co-founder Oliver Luckett responded, "References to his service were banned because MySpace saw it as competition".

Overall, the blocking of video stored on &lt;a href="w%3AYouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; and other sites or embedded in user profiles has led to accusations of censorship from MySpace members. Chris DeWolfe, MySpace's chief executive denies any this, as well as any connection between recent events and the advent of MySpace's own video-sharing service, stating that blocking links or entire sites are sometimes necessary when MySpace investigates complaints of pornography or racism.

There has been concern among groups of bloggers operating out of MySpace that News Corp would monitor or censor their activities, ever since they purchased Intermix, then MySpace's parent company. Ellis Yu told the &lt;a href="w%3ABlog%20Herald"&gt;Blog Herald&lt;/a&gt; that "their CEO said nothing like that would happen. Well, now it has. MySpace was built on an open community and now they're trying to censor us, putting business interests above its members!"

A Florida college professor and his wife have been indicted on charges that they are illegal foreign agents and passed on non-classified information to Cuba.

Florida International University (FIU) education professor Carlos Alvarez, 61, and his wife Elsa, 55, were ordered to be held without bond or bail on Monday. The U.S. Magistrate Judge Andrea Simonton sided with federal prosecution arguments stating the couple would leave their five children and flee to Cuba if granted bail.

Neither of the two entered pleas in Miami Federal Court to the charge that they failed to register themselves as agents from a foreign government.

The couple are reported to have lived "low-profile lives" in the academic community. Despite strong criticism from friends and colleagues, federal agents say that the Alvarezes have been "secretly spying for the Cuban government for decades, using all their academic background as covers."

Citing university policy, FIU put the Alvarezes on administrative leave, with pay Monday, the first day of school for spring semester. Supervisors were asked to relay all questions to FIU's media relations director, Mark Riordan.

The Alvarezes were, however, not charged with the more serious crime of espionage, but the indictment does state that they were trained and equipped by Cuba's Directorate of Intelligence and recruited "young people of Cuban heritage" in the U.S. to be spies. 

The charge carries up to a 10-year prison term and fines up to $250,000.

In their first overtime game ever in the Ontario Hockey League, the Saginaw Spirit &lt;a href="w%3Aice%20hockey"&gt;ice hockey&lt;/a&gt; team won against Sarnia Sting. The Spirit were also victorious in the first ever shootout at the Dow Event Center.

The scoring began at 1:15 of the first period with Spirit forward Chris Chappell scoring on a pass from defenseman Steven Whitely.

The Sting would go on to tie the hockey game with Chad Painchaud and Jamie Fraser scoring at 15:59 and 17:31 respectively. The game was tied at 5 going into the overtime period. 

After a scoreless overtime, the first shootout in the history of the Dow Event Center began. Sarnia's Chad Painchaud and the Spirit's Michal Birner were the first to shoot. Neither scored. On their next shot, the Sting took a 1-0 shoouout lead on Tomas Pospisil's goal. The Spirit would respond as captain Patrick McNeill would score on the very next shot. Shooting next for the Sting, Harrison Reed did not score and neither did Zack Torquato for the Spirit. According to OHL rules, the game then proceeded into sudden death. The Sting shot first. Ryan McInerny's shot was saved by Ryan Daniels. The Spirit sent Ryan McDonough to attempt to win the game. His shot was also blocked by Parker Van Buskirk. Sarnia's next shot was off the stick of Jamie Fraser. It was blocked. The Spirit then sent out Jesse Gimblett, brother of Tyson, to take the Spirit's next shot. His goal won the game for the Spirit at 9:45 pm in front of a sold out crowd of 4,312.

The OHL Three Stars of the Game were Saginaw's Jesse Gimblett with no points, but the winning goal in the shootout, and Patrick McNeill with 1 goal and two assists and Sarnia's Chad Painchaud with 2 goals and 2 assists.

Freelance writer &lt;a href="w%3AJill%20Carroll"&gt;Jill Carroll&lt;/a&gt;, currently working for &lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20Science%20Monitor"&gt;The Christian Science Monitor&lt;/a&gt;, was kidnapped in western Baghdad Saturday morning. During the abduction, her Iraqi interpreter was fatally wounded, although her Iraqi driver escaped and was unharmed.

Carroll was attempting to gather direct and accurate views of political leaders when she entered western Baghdad's Adil area on Saturday morning.

Christian Science Monitor's editor Richard Bergenheim said, "Jill's ability to help others understand the issues facing all groups in Iraq has been invaluable. We are urgently seeking information about Ms. Carroll and are pursuing every avenue to secure her release."

At present, no one has claimed responsibility for her capture.

Two suspected robbers west of Kissimmee, Florida released one hostage after negotiating with sheriffs' deputies. Other hostages remain inside, authorities say. Police later shot and killed one bank robber and arrested a second on after a 10 hour stand-off with police. "A sniper shot the male suspect while the female was in custody", said Osceola County Sheriff Bob Hansell. Four hostages were not injured.

The suspects had escaped the Mercantile Bank, a mile west of &lt;a href="w%3A"&gt;Walt Disney World&lt;/a&gt;'s Wide World of Sports, with one hostage after authorities blasted through the rear door using an explosive device. But police soon cornered them in their getaway car, authorities said. The male suspect then "used the hostage again as a shield to get into another vehicle," Hansell said. "He tried to leave again and at that point he was taken down by one of our snipers."

Deputies had been using cell phones to negotiate with the suspects, who were wearing masks, wigs and coats.

Around 7:15 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20American%20Eastern%20Standard%20Time%20Zone"&gt;EST&lt;/a&gt;, police blasted through the bank's rear door. The suspects escaped with a female hostage and drove away in a bank employee's car, but they traveled less than a mile before street barricades stopped them. Shots were fired at deputies but nobody was hurt, police said. 

The suspects had been holed up in the bank since Tuesday morning. The first hostage was released when the robbers panicked when deputies arrived so quickly after the robbery, said sheriff's spokeswoman Twis Lizasuain. The second was freed in exchange for cigarettes and the third after deputies agreed to back their vehicles a few feet farther away from the bank, Lizasuain said.

Police did not release the names the hostages, but the suspects were identified Wednesday as a 50-year-old male, Gaetano Alessandrello, and a 26-year old woman, Amanda Lynn Moeller. It was not immediately clear whether the suspects ever got any money. Tourists near the bank, in hotels, were confined to them for hours as police asked them "to stay indoors".
The hostages said they were treated well and were not threatened with violence, Hansell said.

The same bank was robbed just 2 months ago on November 16, 2005. It is unclear if the two robberies are connected or not.

A school bus overturned Tuesday morning in &lt;a href="w%3ACharlotte%2C%20North%20Carolina"&gt;Charlotte&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Carolina"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; causing minor injuries to two children and two adults. The driver reportedly swerved to avoid a log in the road. The bus rolled down an embankment and came to rest on its roof. 

The children on the bus were 3 and 4 year-olds from the Bethlehem Center Head Start program. The bus was carrying 18 children, all strapped into safety seats in accordance with North Carolina law. The uninjured were transferred to a second bus and taken to school.

&lt;a href="w%3AWhole%20Foods%20Market"&gt;Whole Foods Market&lt;/a&gt;, a natural food grocery chain based in Austin, Texas, announced that it intends to use wind energy for all of its electrical needs. This will make the company the largest business to use renewable energy in the United States.

"It's a sales driver rather than a cost," Michael Besancon, a regional president for the company, said. "All of those things we do related to our core values: help drive sales, help convince a customer to drive past three or four other supermarkets on the way to Whole Foods."

Since utility companies send power directly to the national utility grid, Whole Foods will purchase energy credits equivalent to 100% of the energy they use, a total of 458,000 megawatt-hours of wind energy credits per year from Renewable Choice Energy. That's enough electricity to power 44,000 homes for a year.

&lt;a href="w%3ARuss%20Tice"&gt;Russell "Russ" Tice&lt;/a&gt;, a former employee of the &lt;a href="National%20Security%20Agency"&gt;National Security Agency&lt;/a&gt; (NSA) who specialized in "special access programs," has admitted to ABC News that he was one of the sources the New York Times used in its December 2005 investigation into the NSA's spy activity against Americans.

He alleges that some of NSA and the Department of Defense's secret intelligence operations were run in violation of the law and has agreed to testify before Congress about their legality.

President Bush admitted ordering the NSA to monitor a small number of Americans without the use of warrants, but Tice believes it goes beyond that. If the full extent of NSA programs is being taken advantage of, he said, the number of Americans under surveillance could be in the millions. The ability exists, Tice stated, to track every domestic and international phone call as they are switched through centers and to monitor them for key words.

"If you picked the word 'jihad' out of a conversation, the technology exists that you focus in on that conversation, and you pull it out of the system for processing."

Tice's security clearance was revoked in May of 2005 based upon "psychological concerns" and the NSA later dismissed him.

The New York Times has not confirmed that Tice was one of their sources, nor have they revealed the identities of any unnamed sources cited in their article.

The iMac and the new MacBook Pro - a notebook computer replacing the PowerBook - are said to be up to four times faster than their predecessors (up to two times faster in the iMac, four times for the MacBook.)

These new lines of computers have been set up to support the newest collection of Mac software entitled &lt;a href="w%3AiLife"&gt;iLife&lt;/a&gt;, which has added internet publication software to its high-end graphics, video, and sound tools.

<h1>Chinese block of Wikimedia enters tenth week</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Chinese%20block%20of%20Wikimedia%20enters%20tenth%20week&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3ABlocking%20of%20Wikipedia%20in%20mainland%20China"&gt;blocking&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AWikimedia"&gt;Wikimedia&lt;/a&gt; project by government agencies of the &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; has entered its tenth week. The Wikimedia project includes Wikinews as well as other popular sites such as &lt;a href="w%3Awikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;.

First instituted on October 19, this is the third such block in China, upsetting students and researchers who say that it is having a significant impact on their ability to conduct research, and even pass civil service exams. It is unclear why they are using Wikipedia as a sole source for research in the first place.

There is little indication of whether the block is temporary or permanent. As with all Internet blocks instituted by the PRC, government agencies have not commented. Wikimedia has been blocked twice in the past and Wikipedia users have speculated that the two previous blocks, both in 2004, were due to articles on banned subjects &amp;ndash; such as &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwanese%20independence"&gt;Taiwanese independence&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ATiananmen%20Square%20protests%20of%201989"&gt;Tiananmen Square Protests of 1989&lt;/a&gt;. 

Many users in China have been using &lt;a href="w%3Aproxy%20servers"&gt;proxy servers&lt;/a&gt; and other means to circumvent the block. Hopes that the block would be quickly lifted, like the previous two times, faded as weeks turned into months. 

On October 21st, a prominent Chinese Wikipedia administrator posted, ♡❤"If nothing goes wrong, the block should be lifted within one week."♡❤ He followed up on the 24th by saying, ♡❤"The block will be lifted by Wednesday [October 26]. According to procedure (the details of which are unknown), after the appeal is submitted, a reply will come within 3 business days, and my appeal has already been submitted by the &lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20service%20provider"&gt;ISP&lt;/a&gt; on Friday. My ISP has said that so far they haven't encountered a case where an appeal has failed. This should be good news, but it's still impossible to know the reason for the block."♡❤ Since then, there has been no reported response from government agencies.

During the first block in 2004, users of the project petitioned their ISPs, one of which is thought to have had a role in restoring access. The second block, slightly later in the year, was only temporary, lasting four days. 

The Chinese government has an active policy of blocking websites they consider harmful. Sites that have been blocked include foreign news sites (&lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20News%20Online"&gt;BBC News&lt;/a&gt; as an example), information about Tibetan independence, the &lt;a href="w%3AFalun%20Gong"&gt;Falun Gong&lt;/a&gt; and some websites based in Taiwan.

Wikimedia Foundation maintains a group of non-profit websites dedicated to open content information that any user can edit. It includes an encyclopedia, news, quote archives, and other information.

The &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; Food and Agriculture Organization has asked countries neighbouring &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;, specifically mentioning &lt;a href="Armenia"&gt;Armenia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Azerbaijan"&gt;Azerbaijan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Georgia%20%28country%29"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;, to be cautious and take measures to prevent the &lt;a href="avian%20flu"&gt;avian flu&lt;/a&gt;, H5N1, from spreading. The UN also warned that civilians in these countries should be given more information about the disease. 

Two people have died in Turkey so far, possibly a third, and more hospitalized, after contracting the flu virus. All 15 confirmed cases in Turkey had close contact with birds. As of now, the H5N1 virus strain does not pass easily to humans and does not spread at all between humans.

A spokeswoman for &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABritish%20Transport%20Police"&gt;London Transport police&lt;/a&gt; said firefighters had checked reports of smoke coming from the Bakerloo line, but the incident was not threatening. Fire services were sent to Oxford Circus and Piccadilly Circus.

The &lt;a href="Ukraine"&gt;Ukrainian&lt;/a&gt; Parliament voted to oust the Prime Minister and his cabinet Tuesday after the handling of the countries gas crisis with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; last week.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AViktor%20Yushchenko"&gt;Viktor Yushchenko&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; called the vote "incomprehensible, illogical, and wrong".

Although Russia and Ukraine have solved the crisis, for the time being, when the two countries agreed to new gas prices last week, the parliament described the deal as "traitorous," reports The Independent of London, and ousted Prime Minister Yuri Yekhanurov's government in response.

Both Members of Parliament and even opposition groups, said they were unhappy with the governments response to the crisis, and began to accuse it of "selling out to Russia and betraying national interests".

The motion to oust the government, which both shocked and surprised many MP's was backed by 250 of the 450 members of Parliament. Mr Yushchenko's former ally and one-time prime minister, Julia Tymoshenko, was among those who voted against the government.

Yushchenko is calling the no-confidence vote politically motivated.

It is expected, however, that the government will remain in place until parliamentary elections are held, which are scheduled to occur in March.

The debate, at the moment, is whether the standing parliament has the authority to dismiss the prime minister. While the constitutional amendments allowing such an action were adopted Jan. 1, Yushchenko and Yekhanurov claim that only the parliament set to be elected in March will have such an ability.

However, there are some that believe that the parliament's move was more about gaining "political leverage" than responding to the gas crisis, reported the Los Angeles Times.

Yushchenko also accused Ukraine's parliament on Wednesday of "destabilizing the country by sacking his government," a move which sent the local currency plumitting to its lowest point in nearly nine months.

Yushchenko met &lt;a href="Vladimir%20Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; for the first time since the Russian president ordered gas taps to be turned off to his ex-Soviet neighbor at the new year in a bitter dispute over prices that briefly disrupted supplies to the rest of Europe.

Last week &lt;a href="Moscow"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt; agreed to a new contract, which Ukraine would pay nearly two times the amount it did before. The two leaders barely touched on the energy issue in comments to reporters after their meeting, instead focusing on the positive side of their strained relations.

"Ukraine and Russia have entered an excellent phase in bilateral relations, a phase of personal friendship, which allows us to discuss wonderful prospects," Russia's Interfax news agency quoted Yushchenko as saying.

Stardust, a &lt;a href="NASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; space capsule carrying precious comet samples from deep space, is scheduled to return to earth January 15, 2006. 

Scientists hope to discover new meaning to the beginning of our solar system.

Stardust's 2.9 billion mile round-trip mission took it halfway to Jupiter to catch particles from &lt;a href="w%3A81P/Wild"&gt;Comet Wild 2&lt;/a&gt; two years ago. Its journey will have lasted a total of just over seven years when it lands in the Utah desert.

On Sunday, the ship will remain in space while a 100-pound (45 kg) capsule loaded with comet dust returns to earth and lands at the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Air%20Force"&gt;U.S. Air Force&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUtah%20Test%20and%20Training%20Range"&gt;Utah Test and Training Range&lt;/a&gt; at 3:12 a.m. local time (5:12 a.m. EST or 1012 GMT). If the skies are all clear on January 15, then people from Northern &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Oregon"&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Nevada"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt; could get quite a show as the capsule enters Earth's atmosphere. The show will be quick, but should prove impressive.

Comets are thought to be remnants from the process of planet formation, and scientists said the dust collected by Stardust will give them their first opportunity to study pristine samples of materials formed billions of years ago. The particles from the comet were captured using a tennis-racket-sized space probe containing ice-cube sized compartments lined with &lt;a href="w%3AAerogel"&gt;aerogel&lt;/a&gt;, a porous substance that is 99.9 percent air. It is the first time since 1972 that any solid extraterrestrial material has been collected and brought back to Earth, and the first time ever for comet particles.

During its descent over the desert, the capsule is scheduled to deploy two parachutes, though NASA officials said they have prepared for the possibility of a hard landing. A NASA probe called Genesis crashed to Earth in 2004 when its parachute failed to open. That craft had been on a three-year mission to collect solar wind ions, which were recovered by scientists even though the spacecraft was destroyed.

Stardust's project manager, Tom Duxbury, said that "after the Genesis incident and the Columbia shuttle disaster, the mission's team spent six months testing and reviewing the spacecraft's design to make sure there were no errors". Once the craft is recovered, it will be whisked away to the Johnson Space Center in Houston. Only after it is in a secure lab, free of potential contamination, will the probe be pried open to reveal its payload.

"We are at the end of a fantastic voyage," Don Brownlee, the lead scientist for the mission known as Stardust, recently told reporters at a media briefing. "We will learn a phenomenal amount… from the most primitive materials in our solar system. It is a real thrilling time." Now, near the end of its long voyage home, the probe is set to plunge back to Earth in the predawn hours on Sunday.

A 7-year old &lt;a href="w%3ATennessee"&gt;Tennessee&lt;/a&gt; boy who was eager to get his driver's license got an early education when he decided to take his parents pick-up truck for a joyride.

The boy, whose name was not released, remembered to wear his seatbelt and even used his turn signal when he was supposed to.

Police chasing the boy initially thought they were chasing a drunk driver. "He was weaving all over the road. He couldn't stay in his lane," Officer Josh Laverette said.

But when the truck came to a stop in front of a house, police saw that it was a boy, a second grader, barely 4 feet tall, behind the wheel. "He was so short he had to sit up close to the steering wheel," Laverette said. "Whenever he would brake, he would pick himself up with his left foot and stomp on the brake with his right."

The boy had barely avoided several collisions, authorities said.

When police began to talk to the boy, who managed to park in front of his own home, "He said the reason he took the vehicle was because he wanted to get his license," said Laverette.

"There were like probably five city cars and three county cars and a state trooper" all of which were chasing the pickup, said Susan Daniel, a witness to the incident. "It blew my mind because we actually watched him put on his turn signal and turn, and we could see when he went past that he had seat belts on," Daniel said. "Then to come find out it was a child, I was really shocked."

The boy was charged with driving without a license, eluding police and leaving the scene of an accident. He is expected to appear in juvenile court next week.

An internal audit of the &lt;a href="w%3AIRS"&gt;IRS&lt;/a&gt; has found that the IRS has improperly identified hundreds of thousands of taxpayers as potential cheats and frozen refunds. Many of the taxpayers are unaware their refunds are frozen because the IRS does not notify taxpayers of their investigations. The audit found that 80% of a sample of cases flaged as potential cheats were actually legitimate refunds.

Many of the frozen refunds were from the poor. The median gross income from the sample was $13,300 with a median refund of $3,519. The median delay was 8 1/2 months. 

Republican Senator &lt;a href="Charles%20Grassley"&gt;Charles E. Grassley&lt;/a&gt;, Chairman of the &lt;a href="w%3ASenate%20Finance%20Committee"&gt;Senate Finance Committee&lt;/a&gt;, said "Refunds have been a source of abuse recently, but we need to make sure taxpayers have proper due process when the IRS decides to freeze a refund." he noted that taxpayers "can't effectively challenge the IRS' actions."

Democrat Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMax%20Baucus"&gt;Max Baucus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said the IRS was after fraud "at the expense of honest taxpayers who need these refunds for food, medicine, home heating and other basic needs."

<h1>World's biggest polluters won't cut back on fossil fuel</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=World%27s%20biggest%20polluters%20won%27t%20cut%20back%20on%20fossil%20fuel&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Six of the world's major polluters, who participated in this week's &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Asia%20Pacific%20Partnership%20on%20Clean%20Development%20and%20Climate"&gt;Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate (AP6 or APPCDC)&lt;/a&gt;, have launched a multi-million dollar fund to develop clean-energy, but stressed they will be heavily reliant on polluting fossil-fuels for generations to come. 

Green groups, labelling the talks a sham, have condemned the climate talks which were held in &lt;a href="w%3ASydney%2C%20Australia"&gt;Sydney, Australia&lt;/a&gt; as a "coal and nuclear pact" between the big polluters and fossil-fuel firms. Australian climate change observers have attacked the AP6 outcomes as grossly irresponsible, saying the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Government"&gt;Federal Government&lt;/a&gt; is willing to accept the reality of runaway climate change.

A communique released by the AP6 states: "We recognise that fossil fuels underpin our economies, and will be an enduring reality for our lifetimes and beyond" - the document said. Green groups say the pact has missed a vital opportunity to commit to renewable energy sources. They say the two-day meeting failed to make any serious commitments in combatting global warming. 

Combined, the United States, China, Japan, India, South Korea and Australia, account for around half the globe's greenhouse gases. The six countries set up the summit as an ulterior method of tackling global warming outside the &lt;a href="w%3AKyoto%20Protocol"&gt;Kyoto Protocol&lt;/a&gt; by, they say, focussing on "clean-energy technology."

&lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20power"&gt;Nuclear Power&lt;/a&gt;, clean coal technologies, &lt;a href="w%3ACarbon%20dioxide%20sink"&gt;geosequestration&lt;/a&gt; and industry-driven environment funds were some of the proposals raised at the summit. Unlike the Kyoto Protocol the six nations have not set any targets to cut &lt;a href="w%3AGreenhouse%20gases"&gt;greenhouse gases&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AClimate%20change"&gt;Climate change&lt;/a&gt; observers have broadly criticised the AP6 as a waste of time. &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Climate%20Institute"&gt;Australian Climate Institute's&lt;/a&gt; Clive Hamilton says the meeting did little to cut greenhouse gas emissions. "I think really this conference is about trying to protect the long-term future of the coal industry," he said. "If you look at the sort of business people who have a seat at the table at the conference in Sydney, they overwhelmingly represent the polluting industries rather than those that will at some time in the future replace them - the renewable energy and energy efficiency industries."

&lt;a href="w%3ACSIRO"&gt;CSIRO&lt;/a&gt; chief scientist Dr David Brockway says the technology required to reduce greenhouse emissions is not viable for industry. 

"It has to be borne in mind that anything we are going to do to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and intensity from the Australian economy will come at a cost," he said. "What we are doing at the moment is doing research to try and reduce the size of that additional cost. I would say in a five to 10 year timeframe a number of these technologies will become viable."

An AP6 communique issued at the end of the conference said reductions in greenhouse gases must be achieved without hindering economic growth - "the partnership aims to mobilise domestic and foreign investment into clean and low-emission technology by fostering the best possible enabling environments," it states. Some of the world's big mining and energy firms attended the talks and pledged to improve efficiency.

Green groups, who were left out of the conference, say the talks were aimed at subverting Kyoto - which obligates some 40 developed countries to cut greenhouse emissions by 5 percent below 1990 levels during 2008-2012. "Basically, they haven't agreed to do anything in terms of serious commitment," said Monash University climate change expert Professor Amanda Lynch. The United States and Australia refuse to sign Kyoto claiming its mandatory greenhouse gas cuts would threaten economic growth. 

&lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20John%20Howard"&gt;Australian Prime Minister John Howard&lt;/a&gt; said, "experience has taught us that seeking arbitrary targets doesn't result in achieving practical solutions to global climate change." Mr Howard stressed the importance of maintaining economic growth to alleviate poverty, while cutting greenhouse emissions.

He said the summit had injected "an overdue dose of realism into the debate about climate change. We believe it is possible to tackle issues of greenhouse gas emissions and the challenge of climate change without reducing living standards," he said. "The world will go on using fossil fuels for many years into the future because it's more economic to do so. So therefore it's elementary commonsense that you should try and make the use of fossil fuels more greenhouse gas sensitive, you should try and clean up the use of fossil fuel," he said.

The &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Wildlife%20Fund"&gt;World Wildlife Fund (WWF)&lt;/a&gt; have dismissed Mr Howard's comments as misleading and irresponsible. The WWF's chief executive Greg Bourne said, "in my whole business career, I have never seen a more misleading public statement as that... If the statements made today become a reality, this will lock us in to a four-degree rise in global average temperatures, when two-degrees is considered extremely dangerous," he said. "There couldn't be anything more irresponsible than to knowingly embark on a path towards massive increases in emissions and runaway global warming."

The AP6 nations said in the final communique that the eight public/private partnership taskforces created at the conference, will draw up action plans by the middle of 2006 on issues including renewable energy, power generation, cleaner fossil fuels and coal mining.

Environmentalists said the Sydney pact was doomed to fail because it did not impose targets on its members which comprise nearly half of humanity. The New South Wales Nature Conservation Council said the group's voluntary approach was a "licence for government and business to do nothing". "Without any incentives or penalties there is no reason for industry to move away from burning polluting coal and oil," said the council's Cate Faehrmann.

The AP6 countries encompass: 49 per cent of world GDP; 48 per cent of the world energy consumption; 48 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions; and 45 per cent of the world's population. 

Many scientists say global warming is melting glaciers, raising sea levels and will cause more intense storms, droughts and floods. Current levels of carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere are higher now than at any time in the past 650,000 years, research from Antarctic ice cores shows.

&lt;a href="w%3AMehmet%20Ali%20Agca"&gt;Mehmet Ali Agca&lt;/a&gt;, jailed in 1981 for shooting and injuring former &lt;a href="w%3APope%20John%20Paul%20II"&gt;Pope John Paul II&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ARome"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt; has been released from Turkish prison. A Turkish court had determined that he had already completed his sentence with time served.

Agca shot the Pope as he rode around St Peter's Square in a open-topped car. Agca was a Turkish militant who was a member of the nationalist &lt;a href="w%3AGrey%20Wolves"&gt;Grey Wolves&lt;/a&gt;; however, his motives for the shooting remain unclear.

Agca was sentenced to life in prison in Italy, before being pardoned by former &lt;a href="w%3APope"&gt;Pope John Paul II&lt;/a&gt; in 2000 and extradited to Turkey to serve jail time for the murder of Abdi Ipekci, a journalist. Turkish citizens were outraged that he served only four and a half years for murder.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Strategy%20Group"&gt;Alexander Strategy Group&lt;/a&gt; (ASG), one of &lt;a href="Washington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;'s top lobbying operations, plans to shut down at the end of January. 

&lt;a href="w%3AEdwin%20A.%20Buckham"&gt;Edwin A. Buckham&lt;/a&gt;, the company's owner and former top DeLay aide, said Monday that the company had been fatally damaged by the publicity surrounding the federal investigation of the lobbyist &lt;a href="Jack%20Abramoff"&gt;Jack Abramoff&lt;/a&gt; and former &lt;a href="US%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House&lt;/a&gt; majority leader &lt;a href="Tom%20DeLay"&gt;Tom DeLay&lt;/a&gt; (R-TX).

The company was founded in 1981 and has thrived due to its connections to Tom DeLay.

&lt;a href="w%3AHospitality%20Club"&gt;The Hospitality Club&lt;/a&gt; became the first &lt;a href="w%3Ahospitality%20service"&gt;hospitality exchange&lt;/a&gt; network to pass the 100,000 members milestone on January 11, 2006. Its closest competitors, &lt;a href="w%3ACouchSurfing"&gt;CouchSurfing&lt;/a&gt; and GlobalFreeLoaders, have 40,000 and 30,000 members.

Hospitality exchange organisations are dedicated to putting travellers in contact with locals offering to host them in their house for free, or simply offer them a tour of their city or share a meal with them. Besides the obvious financial advantage, the Hospitality Club believes that "bringing people together and fostering international friendships will increase intercultural understanding and strengthen peace."

&lt;a href="w%3AServas%20Open%20Doors"&gt;Servas Open Doors&lt;/a&gt;, the oldest network, in fact formally views itself as a peace initiative, and there are also a number of smaller hospitality exchange networks which focus on specialized audiences, such as &lt;a href="w%3AAgritourism"&gt;Agritourism&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AVeit%20K%C3%BChne"&gt;w:Veit Kühne&lt;/a&gt; from Dreseden, Germany, who founded the Hospitality Club in 2000 while he was still a student, believes that "one day, everyone will have the opportunity to visit any country knowing that someone will be waiting to receive them with open arms. People will travel in a different way, meet each other and build intercultural understanding through personal contact."

"There will be many members in places like Israel and Palestine, Northern Ireland, the Balkans, Chechnya, Rwanda, or Timor who will exchange hospitality with each other, and in small steps the Hospitality Club will have helped making peace a lasting vision for our wonderful planet," he adds.

Hospitality Club was the first online organisation to offer on a major scale the possibility for travellers to find and contact locals open to cultural exchange. The whole system is entirely free, and hosting fees are supported by Google advertisements. The safe and efficient operation of the 30+ languages website and its database, forum, and chatroom depends on the work of hundreds of volunteers from around the world.

Anybody can become a member, but they must provide their full name and address, for security reasons. All members have a profile they can fill with information about themselves and their preferences, to help prospective visitors contact the person most likely to welcome them.

The most often mentioned drawback of the system is lack of security. The main difference between hospitality exchange networks and other social networking platforms such as Orkut or LiveJournal is that the former's ultimate objective is to allow for face-to-face meetings. Users should realise that there is a risk involved, although according to Frenchman Jean-Yves Hégron, main software developer of the Hospitality Club, "By using the Club you have the same level of risk as the one you face whenever you get out from your home."

Discussion about strategic or security issues is not allowed on the website's forum, hence critics often mention lack of transparency in how they perceive decisions are taken by volunteers in Hospitality Club. Another point of critique is the fact that there is no legal organisation behind Hospitality Club, and the domain name is registered to the founder of the Club himself. Messages containing links to other hospitality exchange networks were at some point deleted without further notice though this policy has since then been reverted. Exponential growth of the network has also caused server failures alike to those observed in Wikipedia until recently.

The idea of free hospitality exchange is not new. Servas was the first organisation to develop it, right after World War II. It still exists to this day, with over 15,000 members, and is represented as an NGO in the United Nations. Because democratic, paper-based Servas is perceived as bureaucratic by some, Hospex was created as the first online network in 1991.

Hospitality Club succeeded to Hospex in August 2000, introducing innovative security features ranging from spam protection to passport control and a sophisticated feedback system, thus making online hospitality exchange available to travellers with higher safety concerns. From 1000 members in July 2002 to 10,000 in February 2004, it quickly grew to 100,000 on 11 January 2006 and is expected to reach the million in about two years.

Gen. Miller declined to testify during the court-martial trial involving two dog-handlers who are accused of detainee abuse. An attorney for one of the accused is seeking to question Miller on whether he ordered the use of dogs to frighten detainees during interrogations. 

Gen. Miller's lawyer has stated that the decision to decline testifying was taken as Miller has been repeatedly interviewed over the last several years, and that he stands by his previous statements made to Congress, Army Investigators and lawyers.

<h1>Hundreds dead in Hajj stampede</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Hundreds%20dead%20in%20Hajj%20stampede&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

According to the Saudi Interior Ministry over 345 &lt;a href="w%3AMuslim"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; pilgrims have been killed in a &lt;a href="w%3Astampede"&gt;stampede&lt;/a&gt; during the annual &lt;a href="w%3AHajj"&gt;Hajj&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Apilgrimage"&gt;pilgrimage&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href="w%3AMecca"&gt;Mecca&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASaudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt;. 

The stampede at Islam's most holy site happened at Jamarat Bridge, during an event where pebbles are thrown at a pillar to represent the stoning of Satan as part of the final rites of the Hajj. The stampede began when luggage from a bus tripped pilgrims at the eastern end of the wall, causing a bottleneck. Those who were tripped were then crushed by the wave of people behind them.

Muslims are required to make a pilgrimage to Mecca during their lifetimes, if physically or financially possible, as it is one of the five pillars of the Islamic faith. Saudi officials had already provided safeguards by installing an oval wall with padded edges to protect pilgrams from a crush, installed security cameras and placed over 60,000 security personnel in the area.

This is not the first time deadly stampedes have taken place during the Hajj, with the deadliest stampede during the 1991 Hajj, in which 1,426 pilgrims were trampled.

Last week, at least 76 people were killed when the Al Ghaza Hotel near the &lt;a href="w%3AMasjid%20Al%20Haram"&gt;Masjid Al Haram&lt;/a&gt; (Grand Mosque) collasped, the cause of which is unknown.

President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; made a stop over in two of the worst hit cities by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; today. His stops included &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Orleans%2C%20Louisiana"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Louisiana"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABay%20St.%20Louis%2C%20Mississippi"&gt;Bay St. Louis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Mississippi"&gt;Mississippi&lt;/a&gt;.

The president made small speeches in both cities, with references to the many problems that still exist due to a lack of housing, the slow pace of Small Business Administration Loans, problems with homeowners insurance payments and the urgent need for bridge rebuilding.

"People in faraway places like &lt;a href="Washington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;, still hear you and care about you," Bush said standing in a gymnasium at St. Stanislaus College in Bay St. Louis. "I recognize there's some rough spots. We're going to work to make them as smooth as possible."

Bush also recognized and promised that his administration is learning the lessons of its "all-to-slow" and "much-criticized" response to Katrina. "Obviously the federal response in parts of this devastated area could have been a lot better. We want to know how to make them better. We want to make sure that when there is a catastrophe of any kind, this government, at the federal level, is capable of dealing with it in conjunction with the state and local governments.We want to know how to make it better," Bush said during his speech. "I just want to assure you, we are, we are."

Bush went on to praise the city's success in getting the essential utilities, such as, water and electric "mostly" on-line. He also said that federal tax incentives will encourage businesses to create jobs and promised that the new levy system will make the city "both safer and more attractive for investment." He also added that all those things will help New Orleans and the rest of the Gulf, back into a "shining part of the South." He also said "New Orleans is a great place to have a convention" and a "heck of a place to bring your family."

Bush promises that the federal government has allocated 85 billion dollars for reconstruction efforts, $25 billion of which has already been spent on mostly the effort to clean up the debris and provide temporary housing for citizens.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; struck the south central U.S. on late August 29, 2005. 

Katrina first made landfall in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMiami%2C%20Florida"&gt;Miami&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; on August 25, 2005 as a category one hurricane resulting in dozens of deaths in South Florida and spawning several tornadoes. 

Katrina then passed over &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; and headed into the &lt;a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico"&gt;Gulf of Mexico&lt;/a&gt; where it strengthened into a massive category 5 storm.

She then made her second landfall on the morning of August 29, 2005, near &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABuras-Triumph%2C%20Louisiana"&gt;Buras-Triumph&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Louisiana with winds at 125 MPH and a central pressure of 920 mbar, a strong Category 3 storm.

Katrina is quite possibly the strongest hurricane on record ever, but estimating the size of storms from before the 1960s (the pre-satellite era) is difficult to near impossible.

As of January 4, 2006, the confirmed death toll from Katrina stands at 1,386.

Demographers estimate of New Orleans' 400,000 residents prior to Katrina only 25% have returned.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHeisman%20Trophy"&gt;Heisman Trophy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; winner is the favorite to be the top pick in the draft, in which case he would play for the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHouston%20Texans"&gt;Houston Texans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . 

Bush rushed for 1,740 yards during his final college season, and led the Trojans to the Rose Bowl. Quarterbacks &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMarcus%20Vick"&gt;Marcus Vick&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHokies"&gt;Virginia Tech Hokies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVince%20Young"&gt;Vince Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATexas%20Longhorns"&gt;Texas Longhorns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are also likely to among the top draft picks this year.

But Vick, who was kicked off the Hokies team for repeated brushes with the law off the field, had his chances in the draft further reduced by his latest misdemeanor arrest Sunday for brandishing a firearm at a man he believed made a comment about the young woman he was with.

New &lt;a href="w%3ADNA"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt; tests done on &lt;a href="w%3ARoger%20Keith%20Coleman"&gt;Roger Keith Coleman&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AVirginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; man executed in May 1992 for rape and murder, find him guilty of committing the crime.

The results were announced by Governor &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Warner"&gt;Mark Warner&lt;/a&gt; during a Thursday afternoon news conference. "The confirmation that Roger Keith Coleman’s DNA was present [at the crime scene] reaffirms the verdict and the sanction," Warner said. 

The tests end more than a decade of debate by &lt;a href="w%3A%20Capital%20punishment%20in%20the%20United%20States"&gt;death penalty&lt;/a&gt; advocates on both side of the Coleman issue. More than 1,000 have been put to death in the United States since the penalty was re-introduced in 1976. Coleman maintained his innocence in the 1981 crime up until the time of his execution, and never admitted guilt.

The Coleman tests, if he were exonerated, would have been the first time a person who was executed would later be found innocent. A report issued with announcement states that testing standards performed today on the DNA evidence could only share a profile similar to another’s DNA in 1 out of 19 million people, a level of precision not possible at the time of his conviction.

The order for the re-test is one of the last official acts performed by Governor Warner, who will step down as governor on Saturday. The testing was done in &lt;a href="w%3AToronto%2C%20Canada"&gt;Toronto, Canada&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20Centre%20of%20Forensic%20Sciences"&gt;Ontario Centre of Forensic Sciences&lt;/a&gt;, whose findings report that Coleman could not be ruled out as the source of a sperm samples found from the crime scene. 

The attorney for Coleman argued that his client did not have time to commit the crime, and that tests showed semen from two different men was found inside the rape victim, Wanda Fay McCoy . The attorney also said that another man bragged that he murdered her. 

The governor at the time, &lt;a href="w%3ADouglas%20Wilder"&gt;Douglas Wilder&lt;/a&gt;, allowed the sanction to proceed against Coleman after he failed a lie-detector test administered shortly before the execution was carried out.

<h1>Turkish teens died of mutated strain of bird flu</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Turkish%20teens%20died%20of%20mutated%20strain%20of%20bird%20flu&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Scientists have confirmed that the H5N1 virus found in the DNA taken from one of two &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt; victims, who died from the disease, has mutated and they now believe that Turkey is now a locale for endemic &lt;a href="Avian%20flu"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt;.

However, the &lt;a href="World%20Health%20Organization"&gt;WHO&lt;/a&gt;, stressed that it is too early to tell if the mutation is important.

"We assume this could be one small step in the virus' attempt to adapt to humans," said Mike Perdue, a WHO virologist. "But it's only seen in one isolate and it's difficult to make sweeping conclusions. We just have to wait and see what the rest of the viruses from Turkey look like."

Health officials had raised the number of deaths from the H5N1 virus from 15 to 18 after after it turned up in preliminary tests on two people hospitalised in south-eastern Turkey, and in a girl's lungs after she died in the same area. It also has confirmed 147 human cases of the H5N1 virus worldwide and 78 deaths, though this includes only four infections and two deaths in Turkey.

All victims are thought to have had close contact with poultry.

Health officials suggest the virus can now attach itself more easily to human cells than before. 

The mutation has been found in a mutated version of a key protein, haemagglutinin, which controls the way it binds to cells. This, scientists theorize, may be the key in making it more dangerous to people. The mutation makes the virus more capable of attaching itself to human cells before infecting them. But experts said the mutation had been seen before without severe consequences.

Maria Cheng, a spokeswoman for the World Health Organisation, says, "It doesn’t look as if it has significance regarding transmissibility or pathogenicity because it is not borne out by epidemiological evidence we have so far."

The &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt; government has come under fire from officials in Dogubayazit, where three siblings died from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; strain of &lt;a href="Avian%20influenza"&gt;Bird Flu&lt;/a&gt;, for not sending enough resources and not responding quickly enough in the region.

The mayor of Dogubayazit, Mukkades Kubilay, claims that the Turkish government sent only three doctors and that there were not enough workers to destroy poultry.

The government has been accused of doing too little, too late. H5N1 was discovered in Turkish poultry in December, 2005.

Agriculture Minister Mehdi Eker dismissed the claim, saying that culling of infected poultry began immediately following the discovery of H5N1 on December 15, 2005.

Questions about whether the government acted aggressively enough early in the outbreak emerged as officials tried to contain the disease, which Eker said had been confirmed in 11 of Turkey's 81 provinces and was suspected in 14 others.

The number of confirmed human cases of H5N1 in Turkey is 18. Three of those have died from the virus.

Several others with the virus have shown few symptoms or are in a stable condition. Authorities suggest that the strain may not be as deadly as first thought. Of those who contracted the virus in &lt;a href="Asia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;, half died.

An eight-year-old child who became infected after playing with dying chickens has been released from hospital.

Nationwide, 355,000 birds have been slaughtered in an attempt to slow the outbreak.

The Agricultural ministry is complaining that it has only 24 workers in Dogubayazit, a city of 56,000, and culling could take up to a month to complete.

Experts are still warning of a possible pandemic, prompting the world bank to release US$500 million in aid to assist countries combat H5N1.

<h1>Interview with Brazilian blogger Ricardo Serran Lobo</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Interview%20with%20Brazilian%20blogger%20Ricardo%20Serran%20Lobo&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Ricardo Serran Lobo is a Brazilian blogger who writes about his famous neighbor, the politician &lt;a href="w%3ARoberto%20Jefferson"&gt;Roberto Jefferson&lt;/a&gt;, head of the Brazilian Labor Party in the Brazilian Congress of Deputies. Jefferson has become a major figure in the ongoing Brazilian &lt;a href="w%3Amensal%C3%A3o%20scandal"&gt;mensalão scandal&lt;/a&gt; revolving around corruption and bribery.

♡❤♡Vizinho do Jefferson♡❤♡ &lt;a href="http%3A//www.vizinhodojefferson.blogger.com.br/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; quickly became very popular among Brazilians, describing the routine of Jefferson, while providing information about politics and fresh news about the scandal. Lobo's blog got third place in the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.thebobs.com/thebobs05/bob.php%3Fsite%3Dallsuggestions_log%26amp%3Btsrid%3D417"&gt;Best Of Blogs&lt;/a&gt; contest run by Deutsche Welle International.

Lobo gets an intimate look at the center of Brazilian politics by living in &lt;a href="w%3ABrasilia"&gt;Brasilia&lt;/a&gt;, near residences of parliamentarians (including Roberto Jefferson), public buildings and the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies. Or, as he says in his blog: "near the eye of the hurricane," a reference to the recent political crisis. 

At first, Lobo began describing the daily activities of his famous neighbor deputy Roberto Jefferson. As the crisis moved on, he began to describe the political events regarding it. His writings evolved to not only what is going on with Jefferson, but what is going on in Brazilian Congress, and has interviewed politicians, including Roberto Jefferson himself.

The blog tries to be informative, with a lot of humour (common with Brazilians), and some protests against the bad habits of Brazilian politics in general.

&lt;a href="http%3A//www.vizinhodojefferson.blogger.com.br/"&gt;♡❤♡Jefferson's neighbor, the blog,♡❤♡&lt;/a&gt; is an example of citizen journalism and it shows that ordinary people can compete with professional media.

Senior Iranian diplomats still hope for a diplomatic solution to the current stand off between the United Nations and the resumption of its nuclear development program to enrich uranium. The National Security Council spokesman for Iran, Hossein Entezami, said Thursday on a national broadcast that "Iran still believes diplomacy could be productive."

The UN Secretary-General, &lt;a href="Kofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt; said after a Thursday telephone conversation with Ali Larijani, Iran's top nuclear negotiator, that they "are interested in serious and constructive negotiation but within a time frame."

On the one hand, the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20of%20America"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AEurope"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; have grown increasingly concerned over &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; and its decision to resume full nuclear research. 

On the other hand, the concerns about the failure of the nuclear weapons states such as &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUSA"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AUK"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; to progress in nuclear weapons disarmament as is required by Article VI of the &lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20Non-Proliferation%20Treaty"&gt;Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty&lt;/a&gt;, which were summarised at the Non-Proliferation Treaty conference, June 2005 by the &lt;a href="w%3AMalaysia"&gt;Malaysian&lt;/a&gt; representative, Rastam Mohd Isa, have not been addressed.

Talks between Europe and Iran stalled late yesterday to a near standstill and the E.U. joined with the U.S. in its decision to refer Iran to the UN for possible sanctions.

"Our talks with Iran have reached a dead end," the German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, said at a news conference in &lt;a href="w%3ABerlin%2C%20Germany"&gt;Berlin Germany&lt;/a&gt;. "From our point of view, the time has come for the UN Security Council to become involved." &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; is a state alleged by the &lt;a href="w%3ANon-Aligned%20Movement"&gt;Non-Aligned Movement&lt;/a&gt; to be in violation of Articles I and II of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty due to &lt;a href="w%3Anuclear%20sharing"&gt;nuclear sharing&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;a href="w%3ACondoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt;, the U.S. Secretary of State, said that "Iran's actions have shattered the basis for negotiation."

When asked if military force was an option (in Iran) Rice said "The president of the United States never takes any of his options off the table and nobody would want the president to do that... We are on a diplomatic track and it's not on the agenda at this point to move from that diplomatic track." 

Rice's comments have added to speculation that if all diplomatic negotions with Iran fail, that attacks on facilities in Iran using &lt;a href="w%3Amini-nuke"&gt;mini-nukes&lt;/a&gt; might be a possibility.

Despite the criticism from America, Europe, and quite possibly &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, to get Iran to reverse its current course, some diplomats and experts say that the process of getting Iran near that step may take a long time, and may never even work. During the Non-Proliferation Treaty conference, June 2005, it was said that getting USA, France and the UK to disarm according to their obligations under the NPT may also take a long time, and may never even work.

Iran's government continues to insist that its nuclear path is for "peaceful purposes." In a noted turn from Iran's use of aggressive language in defining their position on politically sensitive issue, Entezami said, "Iran pursues its nuclear research activities in the framework of the International Atomic Energy Agency regulations and under the supervision of the agency. So there is no reason for challenging Iran's rights in the field of nuclear fuel."

<h1>Australia accused of bullying East Timor over oil field treaty</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Australia%20accused%20of%20bullying%20East%20Timor%20over%20oil%20field%20treaty&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The Australian Federal Government has been accused of bullying and short-changing the tiny nation of &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Timor"&gt;East Timor (Timor-Leste)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; and East Timor have signed a treaty to share revenue from the Greater Sunrise energy field located in the &lt;a href="w%3ATimor%20Sea"&gt;Timor Sea&lt;/a&gt;. The treaty means each country gets half the revenue from the area - but any further negotiations on maritime boundaries will be postponed for up to 50 years. 

The treaty, signed in Sydney on January 12th was attended by Australian Prime Minister John Howard and his East Timorese counterpart Mari Alkatiri. The treaty is the culmination of long-running negotiations and bitter disputes between the two countries on how to split the $40 billion resource.

East Timorese Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AMar%C3%AD%20Alkatiri"&gt;Dr Mari Alkatiri&lt;/a&gt; said the landmark agreement would provide a major boost to the nation's revenues - while protecting its territorial sovereignty. "I am confident this is for the benefit of the people," he said. Dr Alkatiri anticipated production may be up to 10 years away.

However, an Australian lobby group has vehemently attacked the failure to address, what they say, the bigger and more important issue of permanent maritime boundaries. Timor Sea Justice Campaign (TSJC) spokesman Tom Clarke says the Australia government did not respect conventional maritime boundaries. He says the postponed decision on maritime boundaries means East Timor will not be able to gain control of their territory. 

"The Australian Government has basically bullied the poorest country in Asia into postponing its claim to sovereignty," said Mr Clarke. "So a permanent maritime boundary will not be established under this deal - they're basically leaving that issue for future generations to negotiate." 

Other &lt;a href="w%3ANon-governmental%20organization"&gt;non-government organisations (NGO's)&lt;/a&gt; have protested about Australia's exploitation in the disputed area. A communiqué signed by 12 East Timor NGO's stated that the maritime frontier with Australia should have been established first, before the exploration of resources began. 

Australian energy giant &lt;a href="w%3AWoodside%20Petroleum"&gt;Woodside Petroleum&lt;/a&gt;, operator of the Greater Sunrise project, has given no indication as to when the development might go ahead. Company spokesman Roger Martin said there were still a few steps to go before the Greater Sunrise joint venture partners would be making any decisions on how to proceed.

&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;Prime Minister John Howard&lt;/a&gt; believes the deal is a fair and just outcome and will strengthen relations between the two countries. "It means that the very close relationship between our two countries can not only continue but become even closer," he said.

But Tom Clarke (TSJC) has described the deal as a "stop gap, band-aid solution" - because nothing had been settled on the issue of maritime boundaries. "It simply postpones the real issues of sovereignty for half a century," he said. Mr Clarke said East Timor clearly had more claim over the energy field than Australia. 

"The Australian Government has continually and blatantly refused to abide by International Law. Instead, it has bullied the poorest country in Asia into a series of dodgy resource sharing deals, to take billions of dollars that simply do not belong to us," he said.

The campaigners claim the deal marks another sad chapter of Australian foreign policy betrayal, saying the Howard Government is determined to increase Australia's reputation as a bully in the region. "This really should have been a very simple matter of just drawing a line half way between two coastlines, but once again the greed and self-interest of our, the Australian Government, has brought shame to all Australians who believe in a fair go," Mr Clarke said.

&lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; is awaiting the arrival of very precious cargo from space.

The Stardust Spacecraft is scheduled to land at around 5:12am (eastern time) on Sunday January 15, 2006. Onboard are dust particles that have been collected from the comet Wild 2. 

When the capsule gets to Earth and enters the atmosphere, at about 5am (eastern time), it is expected to put on quite a light show for folks in Northern &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AOregon"&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANevada"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AUtah"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt;. The capsule will look much like a shooting star going across the sky. The capsule will be traveling at about 12.8 km or 8 miles per second, fast enough to go from San Francisco to Los Angeles in one minute. Stardust will set a new all-time record for being the fastest spacecraft to return to Earth, breaking the previous record set in May of 1969 during the return of the &lt;a href="w%3AApollo%20X"&gt;Apollo X&lt;/a&gt; command module. “It will move over the west coast of northern California and will light the sky from California through central Oregon and on through Nevada and Idaho and into Utah,” Tom Duxbury, Stardust's project manager said.

The capsule will then release a parachute approximately 32 km (105,000 feet) and descend into the Salt Flats of Utah. If weather is permitting, it will be recovered by helicopter teams and taken to a cleanroom at the Michael Army Air Field, Dugway Proving Ground, for initial processing.

The capsule itself, only weighs 45.7 kilograms (101 pounds) and resembles a mini Apollo capsule.

Not only will it break the record for the fastest spacecraft to return to earth, Stardust Principal Investigator Don Brownlee of the University of Washington, Seattle, says “We are nearing the end of quite a fantastic voyage – our spacecraft has traveled further than anything from Earth ever has – and come back. He also added that “We went half-way to Jupiter to meet the comet and collect samples from it. But the comet actually came in from the outer edge of the solar system, out beyond the orbit of Neptune, out by Pluto."

If the capsule makes it safely back to earth, scientists hope to unlock many secrets about the formation of our universe. 

"Locked within the cometary particles is unique chemical and physical information that could be the record of the formation of the planets and the materials from which they were made," said Dr. Don Brownlee, Stardust principal investigator at the University of Washington, Seattle.

"Comets are some of the most informative occupants of the solar system. The more we can learn from science exploration missions like Stardust, the more we can prepare for human exploration to the moon, Mars and beyond," said Dr. Mary Cleave, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate.

Stardust is bringing back the first samples of contemporary interstellar dust ever collected, and is also the first mission to return samples from a comet, as well as the first sample return mission from the Galaxy. Not one grain of contemporary interstellar dust grain has ever been examined in a laboratory before.

"We think a significant fraction of comets will be stardust particles actually older than Earth and older than the Sun, and for drama the stars, and the way you identify those is by their isotopic ratios," Stardust Principal Investigator Don Brownlee said. "There are fabulous tools now to analyze these and a very anxious group of scientists waiting for these samples."

Stardust's main mission was to capture dust particles from comet Wild 2, but it is also believed to have captured dust from distant stars, perhaps created in supernova explosions less than 10 million years ago.

The dust can only be found using using a high-magnification microscope with a field of view smaller than a grain of salt. 

But now they have the difficult task of trying to find all these millions of particles, which takes more time and man power that NASA has. That's where NASA decided to try &lt;a href="w%3ADistributed%20Computing"&gt;Distributed Computing&lt;/a&gt;.

Distributed computing has been a huge success. Most of the credit of the success of distributed computing, can be given to the scientists at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley"&gt;University of California, Berkeley&lt;/a&gt;. Scientists there have had and continue to have huge success with a program they created called &lt;a href="w%3ASETI%40home"&gt;SETI@home&lt;/a&gt;, which now uses the distributing platform &lt;a href="w%3ABOINC"&gt;BOINC&lt;/a&gt;.

With the success of BOINC and other distributed computing platforms, NASA hopes to achieve its goal in half the time with the public's help by creating the project &lt;a href="w%3AStardust%40home"&gt;Stardust@home&lt;/a&gt;

"Like SETI@home, which is the world's largest computer, we hope Stardust@home will also be a large computer, though more of a neural network, using brains together to find these grains," said Bryan Mendez of the Center for Science Education at the Space Sciences Laboratory. 

But, the project is not for everyone. First, you will go through a web-based training session and then you must pass a test to qualify to register and participate. In the test, the volunteer is asked to find the track in a few test samples. To judge the reliability of the user, they also plan to throw in some ringers with and without tracks. 

If at least two of the four volunteers viewing each image report a track, that image will be fed to 100 more volunteers for verification. If at least 20 of these report a track, UC Berkeley undergraduates who are expert at spotting dust grain tracks will confirm the identification.

After passing the test and registering, you will be able to download a virtual microscope (VM). The VM will automatically connect to their server and download so-called "focus movies" -- stacks of images that we will collect from the Stardust Interstellar Dust Collector using an automated microscope at the Cosmic Dust Lab at Johnson Space Center. The VM will work on your computer, under your control. You will search each field for interstellar dust impacts by focusing up and down with a focus control.

The other neat thing is that there are no limitations and the more images you examine, the better chance you have at finding an interstellar dust grain.

Any interstellar dust particles that you find, then you will appear as a co-author on any scientific paper by the Stardust@home collaboration announcing the discovery of the particle.

Currently the project is only accepting pre-registration and will be available to the public in mid-March, even before all the scans have been completed in a cleanroom at Houston's Johnson Space Center. In all the project is expected to need at least 30,000 person hours, to go through all the images, at least 4 times by 4 different participants.

Berkeley will host and maintain the project, but it is unlcear as to whether or not the project will use the BOINC platform.

The virtual microscope was developed by computer scientist David Anderson, director of the SETI@home project, along with physics graduate student Joshua Von Korff.

The Stardust spacecraft was launched on February 7, 1999, from &lt;a href="w%3ACape%20Canaveral"&gt;Cape Canaveral&lt;/a&gt; Air Station, Florida, aboard a Delta II rocket. 

The Stardust project is expected to cost $170-million-dollars with a journey that will have lasted over 7 years and actually went around the Sun three times, and "back in time to 4.5 billion years in time to gather these primitive samples that just were released from a comet’s nucleus," Duxbury later added.

The &lt;a href="w%3ABundesnachrichtendienst"&gt;Bundesnachrichtendienst&lt;/a&gt; (BND) helped the U.S. military during the &lt;a href="w%3A2003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq"&gt;2003 invasion of Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, the daily ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AS%C3%BCddeutsche%20Zeitung"&gt;Süddeutsche Zeitung&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, &lt;a href="w%3AARD%20%28TV%29"&gt;ARD&lt;/a&gt;'s ♡❤Panorama♡❤ magazine and the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20Times"&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ concordantly reported on Thursday.

According to their information, two agents of the BND stayed in Baghdad during the war even after the German embassy was evacuated on March 17, 2003. A former "high-ranking official" in the U.S. Department of Defense told ♡❤Panorama♡❤ that the agents helped to track down targets throughout the Iraqi capital for the U.S. &lt;a href="w%3ADefense%20Intelligence%20Agency"&gt;Defense Intelligence Agency&lt;/a&gt; (DIA) as they didn't have enough reliable sources in Baghdad. A BND official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, told the ♡❤Süddeutsche Zeitung♡❤ that there was "no dumbness between the BND and DIA" during that time and that it was part of the BND's "job" in Iraq to identify "non targets" like hospitals or embassies. He said this was authorized by the chancellor's office.

The Pentagon informant of ♡❤Panorama♡❤ however said that the German agents were much more involved. A common saying during the war was supposedly: "Do we have anything from the Germans?" According to him, they drove to a restaurant in Mansur district of Baghdad on April 6th where Saddam Hussein was assumed to be dining. The BND agents reported back to the DIA that many Mercedes cars were parking there. As those cars were presumed to be of Saddam Hussein, the U.S. military conducted an air strike on the location. Hussein escaped, but twelve civilians were killed.

The BND confirmed that two of its agents operated in Iraq during the war but denied all other reports. A spokesperson told ♡❤Panorama♡❤ that it's agency "did not provide target information or target coordinates to the warfaring parties." The intelligence committee of the &lt;a href="w%3ABundestag"&gt;Bundestag&lt;/a&gt; exculpated the BND. Its chair &lt;a href="w%3ANorbert%20R%C3%B6ttgen"&gt;Norbert Röttgen&lt;/a&gt; said that the in secret sitting committee, controlled by government parties, concluded with two-third majority that there are no indications that the agents aided the U.S. in selecting targets.

German foreign minister &lt;a href="w%3AFrank-Walter%20Steinmeier"&gt;Frank-Walter Steinmeier&lt;/a&gt; called the accusations "schizophrenic" while opposition parties are demanding an parliamentary investigation committee. And during a visit of German chancellor &lt;a href="w%3AAngela%20Merkel"&gt;Merkel&lt;/a&gt; to the White House, U.S. president &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush&lt;/a&gt; said in a response to a reporter's question whether he knew anything about the allegations: "The truth of the matter is, the Chancellor brought this up this morning. I had no idea what she was talking about. The first I heard of it was this morning, truthfully".

Prominent &lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thai&lt;/a&gt; civil rights lawyer, Somchai Neelapaichit, is now presumed dead, according to an admission by the country's Prime Minister, &lt;a href="w%3AThaksin%20Shinawatra"&gt;Thaksin Shinawatra&lt;/a&gt;.

Somchai rose to prominence as a lawyer defending Muslim people accused of involvement in the troubles in the predominantly Muslim provinces of southern Thailand. According to the information provided by the PM, evidence has been provided to the Department of Special Investigations that leads them to believe the lawyer is now dead. This is not considered news by the journalist's family, according to his wife the country's Prime Minister admitted to her last year that her husband was dead, and gave assurances that action would be taken against those responsible.

Thailand's DSI became involved with the disappearance of Somchai in July 2005 when allegations were made that police were involved with the lawyer vanishing. His involvement in cases related to the southern insurgency was suspected to have been behind his disappearance. Somchai had lodged appeals with the Bangkok Criminal Court on behalf of five suspects accused of being involved in a raid on a &lt;a href="w%3ANarathiwat%20Province"&gt;Narathiwat&lt;/a&gt; armoury where weapons were seized and soldiers killed, alleging that they had not been given fair treatment during their prosecution.

The admission follows on from the conviction of Police Major, Nguen Thongsuk, who was prosecuted for illegally detaining the lawyer in 2004. Following that he was last seen in public in March 2004. In the case against the police four other officers were acquitted.

A &lt;a href="w%3AUnites%20States%20of%20America"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; military air strike on a &lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistani&lt;/a&gt; village on Friday killed at least 18 people, including women and children. 
U.S. media reports claim that leading &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; member was a target, and that the strike took place in the village of Damadola in the Bajaur &lt;a href="w%3AFederally%20Administered%20Tribal%20Areas%2C%20Pakistan"&gt;tribal area of northwestern Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;. 

The Pentagon has denied any involvement, leading to speculations that the &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Intelligence%20Agency"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; was responsible for the strike. Such speculations have been confirmed by an unnamed American intelligence official; although no official statement has been issued.

Pakistani intelligence officials have contradicted U.S. claims that Ayman al-Zawahiri was in the area at the time of the strike and suggested that the U.S. intelligence information placing him there was incorrect. A Pakistani intelligence officer claimed that Zawahiri was invited to a dinner in the village where the strike took place, but he "did not show up." According to Pakistani army representatives, Ayman al-Zawahiri was not among the dead. &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Arabiya"&gt;Al Arabiya&lt;/a&gt; satellite television network has reported that "a source with contacts with al Qaeda reiterated to Arabiya that Zawahiri is alive."

&lt;a href="w%3AEgypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;, who has Zawahiri's brother in prison, has provided the United States with a DNA sample, which would allow officials to positively identify the fugitive al-Qaeda leader. It is also reported that the DNA has already been used to run tests at the &lt;a href="w%3AFBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20DC"&gt;Washington DC&lt;/a&gt;.

Pakistan condemned the U.S. air strike, summoned the United States ambassador, and said that the country "does not allow U.S. forces to cross the border in pursuit of &lt;a href="Afghan%20Taliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt; and al-Qaeda fighters." Pakistan's information minister &lt;a href="w%3ASheikh%20Rashid%20Ahmad"&gt;Sheik Rashid Ahmed&lt;/a&gt; said that Pakistan wants "to assure the people we will not allow such incidents to reoccur."

However, Foreign Office spokeswoman Tasnim Aslam said that "according to preliminary investigations there was foreign presence in the area and that in all probability was targeted from across the border in Afghanistan."

The Foreign Office issued a statement Saturday saying it lodged a formal complaint with the United States embassy in &lt;a href="w%3AIslamabad"&gt;Islamabad&lt;/a&gt;, where it will be hand delivered by Foreign Secretary Riaz Khan.

Pakistani Intelligence officials are looking into reports that suggest at least seven foreign militants had been killed and their bodies removed by local supporters. 

This complaint is the second lodged by Pakistan against the U.S. in less than a week. The earlier protest was prompted by U.S. missile attack that killed eight people from a village in the &lt;a href="w%3AWaziristan"&gt;North Waziristan&lt;/a&gt; tribal region. According to local officials, none of the victims were terrorist suspects. As a result of the strikes, protests broke out in different parts of the country.

Former &lt;a href="w%3AOregon"&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt; Governor &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Kitzhaber"&gt;John Kitzhaber&lt;/a&gt; announced today that he will not enter the 2006 Gubernatiorial Race. The Democrat stated that he felt he could do more by pushing for reforms in the United States health care system through a grass roots campaign. 

Kitzhaber served two terms as governor of Oregon from 1995 through 2003 and was succeeded by Governor &lt;a href="w%3ATed%20Kulongoski"&gt;Ted Kulongoski&lt;/a&gt;. Kulongoski, who is also a Democrat, has received mixed reviews during his first term as governor. Some had been urging Kitzhaber to enter the race to reenergize Democrats who have become unsatisified with the current administration. 

During a speech at a homeless shelter, Kitzhaber said, ""At least at this point in time, I can make the greatest entrance not by entering a campaign for Governor but by launching a campaign to change the American health care system and by offering people an opportunity to engage around an idea, not just a candidate."

<h1>Huge star cluster discovered in neighbourhood of Milky Way</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Huge%20star%20cluster%20discovered%20in%20neighbourhood%20of%20Milky%20Way&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Astronomers at &lt;a href="w%3ASloan%20Digital%20Sky%20Survey"&gt;Sloan Digital Sky Survey&lt;/a&gt; have announced the discovery of a huge star cluster, the &lt;a href="w%3AVirgo%20super%20star%20cluster"&gt;Virgo super star cluster&lt;/a&gt; 10 kiloparsecs (32,600 &lt;a href="w%3Alight%20year"&gt;light year&lt;/a&gt;s) away from the solar system (roughly the same distance as the galactic centre), in the constellation of &lt;a href="w%3AVirgo"&gt;Virgo&lt;/a&gt;. Many of the stars have been known to astronomers for centuries, but only now have they realized the existence of the cluster.

In a presentation to the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Astronomical%20Society"&gt;American Astronomical Society&lt;/a&gt;, Princeton University graduate student Mario Juric, the principal author of the findings, explained: "Some of the stars in this Milky Way companion have been seen with telescopes for centuries, but because the galaxy is so close, its stars are spread over a huge swath of the sky, and they always used to be lost in the sea of more numerous Milky Way stars. This galaxy is so big, we couldn't see it before."

The large overpopulation of stars was discovered by researchers analyzing SDSS-I and SDSS-II data. SDSS has, to date, imaged roughly one-quarter of the northern sky. The method used was the &lt;a href="w%3Aphotometric%20parallax%20method"&gt;photometric parallax method&lt;/a&gt;. "We used the SDSS data to measure distances to 48 million stars and build a 3-d map of the Milky Way." explained Zeljko Ivezic of the University of Washington, a co-author of the study.

This discovery is one in a series of such discoveries made within the last decade by a new generation of sky surveys. The Saggitarius dwarf galaxy was discovered in 1994 using photographic sky images. Since then, analysis of photographs by large digital cameras has identified several streams and clumps of stars, some of which (astronomers believe) are Milky Way companions and others of which are shreds of the Saggitarius dwarf or other dwarf galaxies that are also dissolving into the Milky Way. An earlier SDSS discovery was the &lt;a href="w%3ACanis%20Major%20Dwarf%20Galaxy"&gt;Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy&lt;/a&gt;. "With so much irregular structure in the outer Galaxy, it looks as though the Milky Way is still growing, by cannibalizing smaller galaxies that fall into it," said Juric.

The first indication that the Virgo super star cluster existed was in 2001, when the &lt;a href="w%3AQuasar%20Equatorial%20Survey%20Team"&gt;Quasar Equatorial Survey Team&lt;/a&gt; (QUEST) survey, using a 1-metre telescope in &lt;a href="w%3ALlano%20del%20Hato%20National%20Astronomical%20Observatory"&gt;Llano del Hato National Astronomical Observatory&lt;/a&gt; in Venezuela, found a clump of five &lt;a href="w%3ARR%20Lyrae%20variable"&gt;RR Lyrae variable&lt;/a&gt; stars, which astronomers speculated might belong to a small galaxy being canibalized by the Milky Way. Kathy Vivas of the &lt;a href="w%3ACentro%20de%20Investigaciones%20de%20Astronomia"&gt;Centro de Investigaciones de Astronomia&lt;/a&gt; in Venezuela, the author of the QUEST paper on the discovery, commented that "In light of the new SDSS results, it appears that the stellar stream we detected is itself part of the larger structure identified by Juric and collaborators."

In a letter to the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAstrophysical%20Journal"&gt;Astrophysical Journal&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ the QUEST has presented further evidence for Vivas' interpretation, by measuring the motions and chemical compositions of stars in the region.

&lt;a href="w%3AAugustine%20Volcano"&gt;Augustine Volcano&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AAlaska"&gt;Alaska&lt;/a&gt; erupted five times on January 13. Friday's activity follows two eruptions on January 11. The Alaska Volcano Observatory predicts the increased activity at Augustine Volcano will continue for several days, possibly for two to three weeks. The volcano last erupted in 1986 and 1976. The AVO expects the current activity to be similar to those two eruptions.

The eruptions have prompted Alaska Airlines to cancel 28 flights into and out of the Alaskan cities of Anchorage, Juneau, Kodiak, and Fairbanks. Ash from the eruptions is likely to spread throughout the &lt;a href="w%3ACook%20Inlet"&gt;Cook Inlet&lt;/a&gt; and surrounding areas.

Augustine Volcano has recently seen an increased rate of seismic activity, beginning in May, 2005. Earthquakes on the island increased from a "normal" rate of 1-2 a day to about 15 a day in mid-December. The volcano also experienced up to two inches of uplift prior to the eruptions.

In a communique issued by the Embassy of the Bolivarian Republic of &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AVenezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AMadrid"&gt;Madrid&lt;/a&gt; as response to the barring of Spain's sale of military planes to Venezuela, and then made public by the chancellor’s office, Venezuela has claimed that the reason why the United States government vetoes the selling of &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ASpanish"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; planes to Venezuela is because &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AWashington"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; wants to continue imposing the flight of American anti-drug patrols dean nations. If the US did so it would violate Venezuela's sovereignty he said.

&lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ASpain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; says it will keep its promise and will equip the planes using &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AEurope"&gt;European&lt;/a&gt; parts to bypass the US licenses.

Venezuela wants to buy 12 planes with a combined value of 2 billion U.S. dollars to carry out its own anti-drug surveillance and interception flights.

Venezuela is also attempting to buy planes from &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;, but this move has also been vetoed by the US government under the grounds that Brazilian planes use US technology.

&lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;ian president &lt;a href="Mahmoud%20Ahmadinejad"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt; spoke out in a rare news conference on Saturday against statements made by &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, saying that if any country refers it to the &lt;a href="U.N.%20Security%20Council"&gt;U.N. Security Council&lt;/a&gt; over its nuclear program, that it will end their voluntary compliance with surprise inspections and other nuclear cooperation with the &lt;a href="U.N."&gt;U.N.&lt;/a&gt; nuclear watchdog, the &lt;a href="IAEA"&gt;IAEA&lt;/a&gt;. He also warned that Europe will lose the chance of reconciliation if it pursues sanctions.

President Ahmadinejad said that even if Iran is referred to the Security Council for possible sanctions, the action would still not stop its nuclear program. "They keep on threatening us that we have to either accept what they say or they will send us to the Security Council," President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said during a news conference in the Iranian capital of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATehran"&gt;Tehran&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Iran's statements came as Europe and the U.S. began to build support for reporting Iran to the U.N. Security Council. However, &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; has been cautious and has warned the move could only escalate the confrontation.

Meanwhile, President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;, and Chancellor &lt;a href="Angela%20Merkel"&gt;Angela Merkel&lt;/a&gt;, urged U.N. intervention. "The world needs to send a common message to Iran that their behavior...is unacceptable," Bush said.

The U.S. and Europe continue to have growing concerns that Iran is trying to produce nuclear weapons.

On Tuesday, Britain, France and Germany issued a statement declaring that 2 1/2 years of tense negotiations with Tehran were a "dead end" and urged the U.N. Security Council to intervene.

Iranian Foreign Minister, Manoucher Mouttaki, said to the press yesterday that "the West will bear the consequences if Iran is sent to the Council. Iran does not need to have permission from any country. It is our legal right to have nuclear energy."

In response the Bush administration, along with Chancellor Angela Merkel, said that they "cannot allow countries such as Iran to blackmail peace-loving countries like themselves."

Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said that his "country does not need nuclear weapons. They are needed only by people who want to solve everything through the use of force." He then went on to say, "Leaders who believe they can create peace for themselves by creating war for others are mistaken."

Tehran has always said it has the right under Article VI of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Anuclear%20Non-Proliferation%20Treaty"&gt;nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;mdash; which the nation has signed but not ratified &amp;mdash; to research nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.

Israeli Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AAriel%20Sharon"&gt;Ariel Sharon&lt;/a&gt; remains in a coma after 10 days.

Medical experts on the outside say that Sharon's failure to regain consciousness does not look well for his recovery.

On Wednesday, doctors began reducing the level of sedatives with the intent of drawing Sharon out of an induced coma. Hospital officials say that Sharon remains "lightly sedated", but are not sure when he will wake up once they stop giving him the sedatives.

New reports say an EEG has shown that Sharon has activity on both sides of his brain and doctors say that's the most "promising" signs they have had since they started to bring him out of the coma. Doctors also say that activity in both lobes doesn't indicate anything about the extent of the brain damage. "It is another piece of information that on its own means nothing," said Dr. Gal Ifergan, a neurologist at Soroka Medical Center in Beer Sheva, who is not treating Sharon. 

Although he has activity on both sides of his brain, Sharon could still have extensive brain damage, Ifergan said. He also said that it's "very worrisome that he hasn't woken from his coma", yet.

There are 2 major types of stroke, and Sharon has had both. The first was a mild &lt;a href="w%3Astroke%23Ischemic%20stroke"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt; Dec. 18 caused by a blood clot that lodged in an artery in the brain, cutting off blood flow and causing minor damage. The second occurred just one day before he was scheduled to undergo surgery to repair a hole in his heart. This one was a severe &lt;a href="w%3ACerebral%20hemorrhage"&gt;cerebral hemorrhage&lt;/a&gt;

"After nine days he has had very slow progress and that indicates more permanent injury to a level where his quality of life is affected," Dr. Demetrius Lopes, a Rush University Medical Center neurosurgeon said. "And then decisions will have to be made," he added.

Sharon's condition is still critical but stable.

The chief judge in &lt;a href="w%3ASaddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein's&lt;/a&gt; trial submitted his resignation yesterday. The reasons for his resignation are still unknown, and it is unknown at this time whether his resignation will be accepted.

&lt;a href="w%3ARizgar%20Mohammed%20Amin"&gt;Rizgar Mohammed Amin&lt;/a&gt;&amp;ndash;one of a five tribunal judges overseeing Hussein's case&amp;ndash;offered to resign, a court official told the press. Prosecutor Jaafar al-Mousawi, told the media that Amin's resignation, if accepted, would not affect the proceedings because he can be quickly and easily replaced.

Since the trial opened on Oct. 19, two defense lawyers have been assassinated, and a third fled the country. Police also uncovered a plot to fire rockets at the courtroom in late November 2005.

Another court official, who wished for his name not to be released, due to the sensitivity of the case, said Amin offered to resign, but efforts were under way to get him to reverse the decision.

At least two judges on the case earlier in the week said that the remarks that Amin was going to resign were "untrue."

Actress &lt;a href="w%3AShelley%20Winters"&gt;Shelly Winters&lt;/a&gt; died of heart failure today at The Rehabilitation Centre of Beverly Hills, her publicist, Dale Olson said. She was 85. 

Winters was hospitalized in October after suffering a heart attack.

Winters was the daughter of a tailor's cutter and her mother was a former opera singer. She made her impromptu singing appearance at a St. Louis amateur night when she was only 4 years old.

She started her career as a nightclub chorus girl, and advanced to supporting roles in New York plays, then became famous as a Hollywood sexpot.

Winters is probably best known for her appearance in the movie ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Poseidon%20Adventure"&gt;The Poseidon Adventure&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. She made several appearances on Roseanne as Roseanne's grandmother.

The &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;i ministry of tourism is reconsidering cutting ties with &lt;a href="w%3AChristian"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATelevangelist"&gt;televangelist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APat%20Robertson"&gt;Pat Robertson&lt;/a&gt; over the construction of a Christian heritage, pilgrimage and tourism site near the &lt;a href="w%3ASea%20of%20Galilee"&gt;Sea of Galilee&lt;/a&gt;. The Christian Heritage Center which would stretch over 125 acres is placed where, according to Christian tradition, Jesus taught and lived in the Galilee region. Robertson was one of the people at the heart of the project which was supported by many other evangelicals who worked to raise $50 million (USD).

Israeli tourism minister, Avraham Hirchson, and Robertson were just about to sign an agreement that the Israeli government would set aside land and infrastructure for the site, when Robertson made comments on his daily show, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20700%20Club"&gt;The 700 Club&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, claiming that &lt;a href="w%3AIsraeli%20Prime%20Minister"&gt;Israeli Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAriel%20Sharon"&gt;Ariel Sharon's&lt;/a&gt; stroke was "&lt;a href="w%3ADivine%20retribution"&gt;Divine retribution&lt;/a&gt;" for withdrawing from the Gaza Strip. Robertson said, "'This is my land,' and for any prime minister of Israel who decides he is going to carve it up and give it away, God says, 'No, this is mine.'" Many evangelicals considered the withdrawal as retreating from biblical prophecy of Jewish sovereignty over the Holy Land.

Robertson's comments earned him a harsh backlash from many different groups, including the White House and former Presidential candidate, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;Senator&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Kerry"&gt;John Kerry&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;. A spokesperson for Robertson said the comments were taken out of context.

On Wednesday, Robertson sent a letter addressed to Sharon's son Omri apologizing for his comments. In the letter, Robertson said Sharon is "kind, gracious, and gentle man" who was "carrying an almost insurmountable burden of making decisions for his nation." The letter further added, "My concern for the future safety of your nation led me to make remarks which I can now view in retrospect as inappropriate and insensitive in light of a national grief." Robertson wrote, "I ask your forgiveness and the forgiveness of the people of Israel." According to the Israeli Ambassador to the United States, Israel accepts the apology.

However, despite the apology by Robertson, it was doubtful that he would be brought back into the plan. Hirchson said on Wednesday that "Robertson's help was no longer welcome." 

Ironically, Robertson helped make television ministries what they are today, and the Heritiage Center would contain studios and satellite uplinks for live broadcasts. The groundbreaking for the project is slated to begin later in the year.

In his weekly open-air version of the popular ♡❤Thailand Weekly♡❤ show, outspoken Government critic and founder of Manager Media, Sondhi Limthongkul launched another series of stinging attacks against the country's Prime Minister.

&lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thai&lt;/a&gt; PM &lt;a href="w%3AThaksin%20Shinawatra"&gt;Thaksin Shinawatra&lt;/a&gt; was accused of planning a cabinet reshuffle in an effort to deflect public attention away from allegations of wrongdoing and corruption. Sondhi alleged that politicians with poor public images would be recruited into the cabinet, and that such was a scheme to overshadow accusations of corruption that have been levelled at the Prime Minister &amp;ndash; mainly by Sondhi himself.

Sondhi vowed to continue pursuing Thaksin for answers to questions raised on the ♡❤Thailand Weekly♡❤ show about government corruption.

Sondhi went on to make further allegations against the Prime Minister, claiming that free trade agreements made with &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; were aimed at benefitting Thaksin's family business interests. Sondhi claims the agreement with Australia would hit local dairy farmer and liquor producers as imports from Australia would be allowed without tariffs. Garlic and onion farmers were claimed to be impacted by the agreement with China whilst the Thaksin family telecom businesses could tap into the Chinese market.

Sondhi's show finished off with a protest march to Government House. The media tycoon led a 3,000 stong crowd with former senator Pratin Santiprapop. By 11pm the number of demonstrators outside Government house was said to be 11,000. Pratin addressed the crowd calling for the resignation of the Prime Minister over a comment he claimed was disrespectful to the King.

Symantec, owner of the security software Norton SystemWorks admits the existence of a security flaw that can be exploited by malwares. The flaw is of the "rootkit" type.

A "rootkit" is a set of tools capable of concealing processes, files and other information preventing the detection of malwares such as virus, spywares and invasion programs. 

In Norton, the "rootkit" works as the following: a folder named NProtect keeps all the files deleted by the user. It allows files to be undeleted. The problem is that Norton (as a "rootkit") hides the folder not only from the user but also from the operating system. It prevents antivirus and security tools from scanning the folder creating a hiding place for malwares. Symantec said that it was to "ensure that a user would not accidentally delete the files in the directory". They also claim to have no knowledge of any attempt to use this flaw and the problem can be easily solved by a normal software update.

British Chancellor &lt;a href="w%3AGordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt; today used a speech addressed to a conference of the &lt;a href="w%3AFabian%20Society"&gt;Fabian Society&lt;/a&gt; to outline his plans for a possible national day for Britain. With the focus of the speech on promoting 'Britishness', Mr Brown asked whether there could be a celebratory day to help develop 'the ties that bind [British] people more closely together'. 

"What is the British equivalent of the US 4th of July, or even the French 14th of July for that matter? What is our equivalent for a national celebration of who we are and what we stand for? Perhaps Armistice Day and Remembrance Sunday are the nearest we have come to a British day that is – in every corner of our country – commemorative, unifying, and an expression of British ideas of standing firm in the world in the name of liberty responsibility and fairness?"

Former Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Major"&gt;John Major&lt;/a&gt; spoke to the BBC Today programme and agreed that the chancellor was "absolutely right" to promote the concept of Britishness, but added "he seems not to mention that many of the actions of the present Government have ruptured Britishness by their own legislation." 

A spokeperson for the Commission for Racial equality welcomed the speech, saying "it is important to talk about and identify our shared common values and discuss ideas and find ways to celebrate being British".

Gordon Brown also argued that the British Union Jack flag should be reclaimed from far-right groups such as the BNP, saying "the flag should be a symbol of unity, part of a modern expression of patriotism".

The speech was released in advance to the media on the Labour Party website.

Meeting yesterday at &lt;a href="w%3AItamaraty"&gt;Itamaraty&lt;/a&gt;, Brazil's Foreign Ministry, Bolivian President-elect &lt;a href="w%3AEvo%20Morales"&gt;Evo Morales&lt;/a&gt; and Brazilian President &lt;a href="w%3ALuiz%20In%C3%A1cio%20Lula%20da%20Silva"&gt;Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva&lt;/a&gt; outlined plans for broad cooperation between the two countries during Morales' upcoming term in office, which begins on the 22nd of this month. Lula's special assistant for International Issues, Marco Aurélio Garcia, mentioned in particular that Bolivia might be interested in development of its petroleum resources with the help of Brazil's Petrobras, as well as in increasing social programs and seeking to deepen its relationship with other governments.

According to Garcia, there are plans to form a bilateral commission to guide cooperation between the two nations in the coming years.

Public statements from the two leaders have characterized the meeting in glowing terms. After the talks, Morales described a "relationship of brotherhood," saying that he looks forward to the help of Brazil, whom Morales says, "leads the region." Asked about whether the close bonds between the growing number of leftist governments in Latin America constitued the development of an anti-United States counterweight in the region, Morales responded, "We are for a culture of dialogue...We are not going to create a bloc against the U.S."

19-year-old Canadian citizen &lt;a href="w%3AOmar%20Khadr"&gt;Omar Ahmed Khadr&lt;/a&gt; attended a pre-trial hearing on Wednesday, January 11, in front of a military tribunal at the U.S. naval base in &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20Bay"&gt;Guantánamo Bay&lt;/a&gt; in his case involving charges of murder, attempted murder and aiding the enemy.

Khadr was 15 when on July 27, 2002, following the &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20invasion%20of%20Afghanistan"&gt;U.S. invasion of Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, he was present in a compound near &lt;a href="w%3AKhost"&gt;Khost&lt;/a&gt; which was surrounded by US soldiers. After a fierce firefight and U.S. bombings of the compound, U.S. special operations forces Sgt. &lt;a href="w%3AChristopher%20J.%20Speer"&gt;Christopher Speer&lt;/a&gt;, who has training as a &lt;a href="w%3Amedic"&gt;medic&lt;/a&gt;, led a group of US soldiers searching the compound in the belief that everybody inside had been killed. According to U.S. army reports, Omar Khadr, who was wounded by the bombings and the only survivor in the compound, fired his pistol and threw a grenade which killed Christopher Speer and wounded three others. In response, Khadr was engaged by U.S. forces and shot three times, which left him nearly blind in one eye.

While still 15 years old, Khadr was transferred to the U.S. detention facility at Guantánamo Bay, where he was kept together with adult detainees, separate from other children who received better treatment and some formal education. Now Khadr is 19 and is facing the tribunal operated exclusively by the US military. 

The tribunal is referred to by different media organizations as a "&lt;a href="w%3Awar%20crime"&gt;war crimes&lt;/a&gt; court", a "military commission" or a "&lt;a href="w%3Amilitary%20tribunal"&gt;military tribunal&lt;/a&gt;". Its legality is presently under dispute. The &lt;a href="w%3AUSA"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt; has not ratified the international &lt;a href="w%3Atreaty"&gt;treaty&lt;/a&gt; creating the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Criminal%20Court"&gt;International Criminal Court&lt;/a&gt;, so the nature of the tribunal under &lt;a href="w%3Ainternational%20law"&gt;international law&lt;/a&gt; is unclear. The &lt;a href="w%3AMiami%20Herald"&gt;Miami Herald&lt;/a&gt; reports that "military defense lawyers and legal observers &lt;nowiki&gt;[condemn]&lt;/nowiki&gt; the so-called military commissions as stacked against the defendants", but that the chief Pentagon prosecutor, Air Force Col. Morris "Moe" Davis defended the tribunal, stating that the purpose of the tribunals is to provide a fair trial while addressing an enemy whose actions had not been anticipated under the &lt;a href="w%3AGeneva%20Convention"&gt;Geneva Conventions&lt;/a&gt;. "We have nothing to be ashamed of, and I'm proud of everybody involved in the process," he said.

The &lt;a href="w%3ASupreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; of the US is expected to decide on the constitutionality of this type of military tribunal in the next few months, with oral arguments in March, to consider charges that the "tribunals" violate US obligations under the &lt;a href="w%3AGeneva%20Convention"&gt;Geneva Conventions&lt;/a&gt;. 

Khadr has requested an upgrade to his legal team. The military defense lawyer appointed to him by the tribunal is a 31-year-old army captain, who has never before handled a trial defense and just recently returned from his tour of duty in Iraq.

The &lt;a href="w%3ASaginaw%20Spirit"&gt;Saginaw Spirit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AOttawa%2067%27s"&gt;Ottawa 67's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20Hockey%20League"&gt;Ontario Hockey League&lt;/a&gt; teams faced off in a high-scoring competition Saturday night at &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Dow%20Event%20Center"&gt;The Dow Event Center&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASaginaw%2C%20Michigan"&gt;Saginaw, Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, with the Spirit topping the 67's at a score of 7-5.

The Spirit made their mark in the first period, scoring three goals. Tim Priamo scored the first goal of the night, followed by Tom Craig, who scored his first ever OHL goal. Ryan McDonough rounded out the period with the Spirit's third goal.

The second period continued a lead for the Spirit, with Patrick Asselin scoring another goal for the Spirit, making the score 4-0 before the 67's responded when Julian Talbot shot two goals in the period, making the score 4-2. 

Saginaw's Tyson Gimblett and Ottawa's Joe Grimaldi held a fistfight on the ice during second period, with Gimblett drawing a two minute instigator penalty, along with a five minute fighting penalty and a ten minute misconduct during the incident. Grimaldi was charged with a five minute penalty for fighting. Another fight late in the period between the 67's Elgin Reid and the Spirit's Jamie Klie had both in the penalty box for five minutes.

Third period goals, separated only by seconds, from Ottawa's Chris Hulit and Jamie McGinn took lead of the game for the 67's, upping the Spirit by one. The Spirit responded with two of their own from Patrick McNeil and Matt Corrente, regaining the lead for Saginaw, 6-5.

With only minutes remaining, Ottawa pulled their goalie from net to gain a man advantage. Saginaw's last goal of the game was scored by Michael Birner, making the final score of the game 7-5.

The Spirit team maintains second position for their West division, behind the &lt;a href="w%3APlymouth%20Whalers"&gt;Plymouth Whalers&lt;/a&gt;. The 67's are currently fourth in the East division.

&lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistani&lt;/a&gt; tribesmen numbering in the thousands protested and some set fire to the office of a U.S. related agency as the people and government of Pakistan for the second consecutive day on Sunday expressed their anger over U.S. attacks on Pakistani civilians along the frontier.

Many major cities in Pakistan were affected by the protests. In the largest city of &lt;a href="w%3AKarachi"&gt;Karachi&lt;/a&gt;, the crowd was estimated at 10,000, with chants of "Death to America" and "Stop bombing against innocent people." Riot police were deployed, but there were no reports of violence.

In a nationally broadcasted speech on Sunday by President &lt;a href="w%3A%20Pervez%20Musharraf"&gt;Pervez Musharraf&lt;/a&gt;, he made no reference to the Friday air strike. "If we keep sheltering foreign terrorists here ... our future will not be good. Remember what I say," he said.

Pakistan's Information Minister, Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, said the attack was "highly condemnable" and that his government wanted "to assure the people we will not allow such incidents to reoccur."

Liaqat Baluch, a lawmaker from Mutahida Majlis-e-Amal, said "We demand that Pervez Musharraf resign and American troops vacate all parts of Pakistan and go out of Afghanistan and Iraq." Sahibzada Haroon ur Rashid, a lawmaker from a hardline Islamic party, called the attack "open terrorism."

Protests opposing the government's participation in the U.S.-led war on terror, and the recent series of U.S. attacks along the frontier that killed civilians were held nationwide. Shahid Shamsi, a spokesman for the anti-American religious coalition that organized the rallies announced more and bigger protests in the days to come. He said "Pakistani civilians, including children, were killed," and explained that "principles cannot be broken in the name of (fighting) terrorism."

Unnamed sources in the United States indicate that the missile strikes were intended to assassinate specific Al-Queda members.

The Pakistani Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3A%20Shaukat%20Aziz"&gt;Shaukat Aziz&lt;/a&gt; of the ruling &lt;a href="w%3A%20Pakistan%20Muslim%20League%20%28Q%29"&gt;Muslim League (Q)&lt;/a&gt; party demanded an apology from the United States on Monday. He also said his scheduled trip to the United States will proceed as planned. He will leave Tuesday for talks there on security issues, and meet with business leaders to garner foreign investment.

"All stations, we have touchdown," an announcer declared.

&lt;a href="w%3AStardust%20%28spacecraft%29"&gt;Stardust&lt;/a&gt;, a capsule carrying dust from &lt;a href="w%3A81P/Wild"&gt;Comet Wild 2&lt;/a&gt;, has landed safely in the &lt;a href="w%3AUtah"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt; desert. It also is the first time in history that a space mission has brought back such material.

"The tiny particles that the Stardust mission is bringing back are the most scientifically exciting and technically challenging material that we have ever had the opportunity to study," said Monica Grady of the Planetary and Space Science Research Institute (PSSRI).

When the landing was complete, it drew cheers from excited scientists. 

"It's an absolutely fantastic end to the mission," said Carlton Allen of NASA's Johnson Space Center.

"Everything worked so well. What an exciting moment," said Allan Cheuvront, Stardust spacecraft engineer at &lt;a href="w%3ALockheed%20Martin%20Space%20Systems"&gt;Lockheed Martin Space Systems&lt;/a&gt;. 

Many reports are stating from skywatchers, that sighted the speeding capsule as it shot across the sky over the western United States. "We saw it in the sky…it was great," said Paula Nicholson, Public Affairs Officer at the U.S. Army &lt;a href="w%3ADugway%20Proving%20Ground"&gt;Dugway Proving Ground&lt;/a&gt;.

In 2004, another collector capsule from another spacecraft, &lt;a href="w%3AGenesis%20%28spacecraft%29"&gt;Genesis&lt;/a&gt;, which collected solar wind particles crashed into the Utah desert, however, the samples did not survive.

After the capsule landed, it activated its locator beacon and helicopter recovery crews successfully located the capsule in the dark. The capsule is reportedly intact from the helicopter observations, and the unofficial touch down time was 5:10 a.m. EST. It will be transferred to a "cleanroom" and is expected to be flown to &lt;a href="w%3ALyndon%20B.%20Johnson%20Space%20Center"&gt;Johnson Space Center&lt;/a&gt; early next week where the capsule will be unlocked for the first time since it landed.

When opened, scientists will find the microscopic dust particles trapped in a porous, pale-blue smokelike material known as &lt;a href="w%3Aaerogel"&gt;aerogel&lt;/a&gt; made up of 99.8 percent air that was used to snag the dust in space. 

The dust then will be looked at under a microscope to be examined and because this comet is nearly 5 billion years old, they hope it will unlock some of the secrets to the formation of our galaxy and universe.

The capsules speed when it was going through Earth's atmosphere was a record breaking 29,000 mph, making it the fastest man-made probe to return to Earth. Its first parachute opened at nearly 100,000 feet from the ground where it was then guided to a 10-MPH landing in the desert.

The capsule also brought back with it 72 black-and-white pictures showing broad mesas, craters, pinnacles and canyons with flat floors on the surface of Wild 2, which was a staggering 500 million miles from Earth at the time Stardust was launched.

Stardust was launched in 1999 and its trip lasted over 7 years. Stardust traveled about 4.5 billion kilometers (2.88 billion miles), and went around the sun 3 times. In the end, a magnificent achievement for NASA and science in general.

Many Pakistanis took to the streets Saturday to demonstrate against the U.S. air strike of a village on the border of Afghanistan. The main demonstration took place in the city of &lt;a href="w%3AKarachi"&gt;Karachi&lt;/a&gt;, where protestors shouted "Death to American Aggression" and "Stop bombing innocent people", a BBC report claims. Riot police were deployed to keep order.

A rally also took place in the town of &lt;a href="w%3ASamarbagh"&gt;Samarbagh&lt;/a&gt;, where over 600 people came out to protest, according to the Aljazeera news network. Speaking at the rally, Aizaz-ul Mulk Afkari, a leader from the Hezb-ul Mujahidin group, is reported to have claimed that Washington was targeting Pakistan because of its nuclear weapons.

The previous day, around 8000 tribesmen are reported to have staged a rally in the town of &lt;a href="w%3AInayat%20Qala"&gt;Inayat Qala&lt;/a&gt;. The US has not yet commented on the attack.

&lt;a href="w%3AAriel%20Sharon"&gt;Ariel Sharon&lt;/a&gt;, 77, is scheduled to undergo a tracheotomy today, which is expected to help wean him off a respirator, which is helping him to breathe, a hospital statement said.

A tracheotomy is a procedure where an incision in the windpipe is made to create a temporary or permanent opening. It will allow for the removal of the breathing tube now inserted in Sharon's throat. Sharon suffered a major stroke on January 4, 2006. Last week, doctors said the plastic tube connecting his windpipe with the respirator would start to cause him damage if left in for too long.

Tracheotomies are routinely performed on stroke victims to reduce the risk of infection posed by intubation.

"The prime minister's condition continues to remain critical but stable," said a statement issued by Jerusalem's Hadassah hospital where doctors have been trying, unsuccessfully, to wake Sharon from a medically induced coma. "This evening the prime minister will undergo a CT test after which he will undergo a tracheotomy. The surgery is aimed at helping to wean him off a respirator machine. It will be conducted in the operating room under general anaesthesia."

Today, a controversial decision was taken by referee Chris Foy in a recent match between &lt;a href="w%3ASunderland%20A.F.C."&gt;Sunderland Association Football Club&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AChelsea%20F.C."&gt;Chelsea Football Club&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;U.K.&lt;/a&gt; to send off Chelsea's Robben after "excessive celebrations". The decision was taken after Robben proceeded to embrace fans beyond the barriers of the club, which was seen by the referee to be a breach of safety regulations, as well as &lt;a href="w%3AFIFA"&gt;FIFA&lt;/a&gt; policy.

As consensus, ex-match officials watching the game agreed the decision was thought to lack common sense. However, the policy of restricting player celebrations was introduced into FIFA policy last year after safety concerns from various match officials. FIFA rules state several situations in which celebrations may lead to booking;
<ul>
BULLET::::- If, In the opinion of the referee, a player makes gestures which are provocative, derisory or inflammatory.
BULLET::::- If the player climbs on to a perimeter fence to celebrate a goal being scored.
BULLET::::- If the player removes his shirt over his head or covers his head with his shirt.

</ul>
However, the rule which &lt;a href="w%3ABSkyB"&gt;BSkyB&lt;/a&gt; stated in the pre match commentary was more relevant, because the aforementioned rules were not in any way broken; referring to the fact that perimeter fences were only common in Spanish football. The guideline stated that "♡❤leaving the field to celebrate a goal is not a cautionable offense in itself but it is essential that players return to the field as soon as possible♡❤".

Despite the justification of the referee's call, both Robben himself, and commentator Andy Gray questioned the common sense nature of the decision, noting that quick thinking and spontaneous decision should be something a referee focuses on, rather than the implicit enforcement of minor rules.

In response to the decision, Andy Gray noted;

♡❤♡Helsinki, Finland♡❤♡ - The second round of &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20Finland"&gt;presidential elections&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Finland"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt; have concluded, with incumbent &lt;a href="w%3ATarja%20Halonen"&gt;Tarja Halonen&lt;/a&gt; of left wing parties gaining 51,8% of the vote (with 100% of all votes tallied), and former finance minister, &lt;a href="w%3ASauli%20Niinist%C3%B6"&gt;Sauli Niinistö&lt;/a&gt; of the national coalition party gaining 48,2%. Pre-election studies indicated a close match with both candidates gaining approximately 50% support in polls. Halonen got 53,9% of the advance votes, while Niinistö got 46,1%. Both candidates got close to 50% of election-day votes (January 29). The total turnout in the end was 74,0%, or 3,163,096 voters. These results are to be confirmed by Wednesday.
In Comparison, Halonen won the second round against &lt;a href="w%3AEsko%20Aho"&gt;Esko Aho&lt;/a&gt; in the year 2000, with approximately the same percentage. Total turnout then was 80,2%. 

Halonen failed to win an outright majority in the first round, resulting in a second round against Niinistö, the runner-up in the first round.

A major talking-point in the elections was the possibility of Finland becoming a member of the (NATO). Halonen upholds the current Finnish policy of non-alignment and a reliable, independent defensive force, but does not outrule the possibility of Finland becoming a member sometime in the future. Co-operation with NATO will continue and be expanded on, despite the fact that the majority of Finns oppose outright membership.

Halonen will be inaugurated on March 1 for her second term, becoming the 19th president of Finland.

♡❤♡Helsinki, Finland♡❤♡ - The first round the presidential elections were held today. With all (100%) of the votes counted, no candidate reached more than the number of votes necessary to win. The top two candidates, the social-democrat incumbent, &lt;a href="w%3ATarja%20Halonen"&gt;Tarja Halonen&lt;/a&gt; with 46,4% and the conservative, &lt;a href="w%3ASauli%20Niinist%C3%B6"&gt;Sauli Niinistö&lt;/a&gt; with 24,1 %, will go the next round in two weeks time, on the 29th. Finland has its presidential election every 6 years and it decided on the &lt;a href="w%3AInstant-runoff%20voting"&gt;alternative vote&lt;/a&gt; system of 50%+1.

Finland is a &lt;a href="w%3ANordic"&gt;Nordic&lt;/a&gt; country with semi-presidential system of government, in which both &lt;a href="w%3Apresident"&gt;president&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aprime%20minister"&gt;prime minister&lt;/a&gt; are heads of government. The role of president of Finland has become smaller the past years due to changes in the &lt;a href="w%3AConstitution%20of%20Finland"&gt;constitution&lt;/a&gt;, though president is still head of foreign policy and the commender-in-chief of the &lt;a href="w%3AFinnish%20Defence%20Forces"&gt;Finnish Defence Forces&lt;/a&gt;. 

One of the main issues in this election is Finland's relation to &lt;a href="w%3ANATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt;. Some candidates like Halonen and the &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20League"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt; candidate &lt;a href="w%3AHeidi%20Hautala"&gt;Heidi Hautala&lt;/a&gt; oppose and some candidates like Niinistö and &lt;a href="w%3AHenrik%20Lax"&gt;Henrik Lax&lt;/a&gt; support joining NATO. Though president is not in a position to decide about this, it is considered by some as a signal from the voters if they support NATO supporting or NATO resisting candidates.

<h1>US Justice Department sues American Airlines on behalf of reservists</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=US%20Justice%20Department%20sues%20American%20Airlines%20on%20behalf%20of%20reservists&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The US government has filed a lawsuit against &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Airlines"&gt;American Airlines&lt;/a&gt; on behalf of three pilots. The pilots were employed by the company while serving in the &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Naval%20Reserve"&gt;Naval Reserve&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Air%20National%20Guard"&gt;Air National Guard&lt;/a&gt;. 

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice"&gt;US Department of Justice&lt;/a&gt; alleges that when the pilots were called into active duty by the US military, American Airlines denied them employment benefits. The Department of Justice said in a complaint filed in the US District Court in Dallas that American Airlines conducted an audit of leave taken for military service by pilots in 2001. The Justice Department charges that based on that audit American Airlines then cut the employment benefits of pilots who had taken military leave while not cuting benefits of pilots who had taken non-military leave.

Justice Department Assistant Attorney General Wan Kim said "This nation depends on our reservists to faithfully carry out their duty. No reservists, indeed no members of the armed forces, should ever be punished or discriminated against for answering the call of duty."

This is the first class action lawsuit under the 1994 &lt;a href="w%3AUniformed%20Services%20Employment%20and%20Reemployment%20Rights%20Act"&gt;Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>US Senators, EU voice support for Iran sanctions</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=US%20Senators%2C%20EU%20voice%20support%20for%20Iran%20sanctions&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

At least 15 &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="US%20Senate"&gt;senators&lt;/a&gt; from both the Democratic and Republican parties voiced strong support for sanctions against &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; unless it halts its nuclear program completely, and at least one senator has hinted that military action is a possibility in the future. 

Senator &lt;a href="John%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt; (R-&lt;a href="Arizona"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;), said on CBS that "The United States should press for sanctions even if that led to higher oil prices." He also added that "this is the most grave situation that we have faced since the end of the Cold War, absent the whole war on terror."

Another Republican Senator, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALindsey%20Graham"&gt;Lindsey Graham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;a href="South%20Carolina"&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, speaking on the Fox News Channel, said there should be "tougher measures." He also stated that "all options should be kept open," which could imply the use of military force. However, Senator Graham also said that "we need to work together with our &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;an allies."

The most well-known military action by the US against an elected government in Iran was the Anglo-American covert &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOperation%20Ajax"&gt;Operation Ajax&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 1953 in which Prime Minister &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMohammed%20Mossadegh"&gt;Mohammed Mossadegh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was overthrown and the exiled &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AShah%20Mohammed%20Reza%20Pahlavi"&gt;Shah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was restored to the throne as a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Adictator"&gt;dictator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADianne%20Feinstein"&gt;Dianne Feinstein&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (D-&lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;), said she "agrees with McCain's assessment of the extent of Iran's threat. Iran has much more opportunity to create devastation in the &lt;a href="Middle%20East"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt; than &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; at this time," she said. "I think it's a very serious threat." Regarding the need for continued international cooperation, Feinstein stated that the issue is a "major test of the international community."

On Thursday, &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="UK"&gt;Great Britain&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; officially declared an end to negotiations with Iran, a move endorsed by The United States.

On Friday, &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; renewed its call for Iran to resume cooperation with the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Atomic%20Energy%20Agency"&gt;International Atomic Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (IAEA). 

"We again call on Iran to reconsider its decisions and return to the state of moratorium and implement full and transparent cooperation with the IAEA, as is foreseen in the appropriate resolutions of the agency's board," Foreign Ministry spokesman Mikhail Kamynin said in a statement to the press.

Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov said "all efforts must be made to ensure the peaceful resolution of the crisis and that diplomatic methods had not been exhausted." He then added that Russia's "proposal" to move the final phase of Iran's enrichment program to Russian territory is "still on the table for discussion."

&lt;a href="Mohamed%20ElBaradei"&gt;Mohamed ElBaradei&lt;/a&gt;, Chief of the IAEA, said in a press release today that he is so far unable to confirm whether Iran's controversial nuclear program is peaceful. "For the last three years we have been doing intensive verification in Iran, and even after three years I am not yet in a position to make a judgment on the peaceful nature of the (nuclear) program." He also added that Iran would only be a "few months from building a nuclear bomb if it has nuclear material at the same time as a weaponization program."

"We still need to assure ourselves through access to documents, individuals and locations, that we have seen all that we ought to see and that there is nothing fishy, if you like, about the (nuclear) program," ElBaradei said.

Iranian Finance Minister Davood Danesh Jafari said on an Iranian radio station today that "any Western sanction placed on Iran, in response to its nuclear development program could raise global oil prices... sanctions on Iran, could possibly, by disturbing Iran's political and economic situation, raise oil prices beyond levels the West expects," he told state radio.

On Saturday, the Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said during a rare press conference to address the European Union that Iran will "consider using its control over oil prices as retalliation for potential sanctions on Iran." Today he said, "only diplomacy, not threats to refer it to the &lt;a href="U.N."&gt;U.N.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="UN%20Security%20Council"&gt;Security Council&lt;/a&gt;, could defuse a standoff."

In a press conference on Friday, &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; Secretary General &lt;a href="Kofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt; said that he had spoken to the Iranian representative in the IAEA in Vienna, Ali Laridziani, who said "Iran is interested in serious and constructive negotiations, but without time constraints."

The United States and the E.U. harshly criticized Annan's "spin" on the Iranian response, stating that because diplomatic talks have reached their limit, the matter should be deferred to the Security Council.

Iran continues to insist that its nuclear energy is to be used to provide electricity for an "energy-needy economy, not to build (atom) bombs."

Iran announced on January 10, 2006, that it was going to "resume full nuclear research."

At 21:30 local time (00:30 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt; of Monday), Bachelet has said: 

Ms. Bachelet supporters are reportedly celebrating her victory.

They show that &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; was spying on the communications of &lt;a href="w%3AArgentina"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASoviet%20Union"&gt;the Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Germany"&gt;East Germany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AEgypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AVietnam"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALaos"&gt;Laos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APhilippines"&gt;the Philippines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFiji"&gt;Fiji&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATonga"&gt;Tonga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASolomon%20Islands"&gt;the Solomon Islands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;the United Nations&lt;/a&gt; diplomatic cables.

The leak came when a copy of the &lt;a href="w%3AGovernment%20Communications%20Security%20Bureau"&gt;Government Communications Security Bureau's&lt;/a&gt; (GCSB) 1985-1986 annual report was found among the personal papers of former &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Prime%20Minister"&gt;New Zealand Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Lange"&gt;David Lange&lt;/a&gt;. After &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Cabinet"&gt;Cabinet&lt;/a&gt; signed off, they were released by &lt;a href="w%3AArchives%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Archives New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;. 

According to intelligence expert &lt;a href="w%3ANicky%20Hager"&gt;Nicky Hager&lt;/a&gt;, "This is the most secret report and most revealing one ever to come to the public."

Duty Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Anderton"&gt;Jim Anderton&lt;/a&gt; says the report should have been returned to the GCSB after David Lange had read it. "There'll be some investigation by officials as to how the report was not returned and was just left in the archive like this for people to stumble over... I think there'll be some concern about that."

The report also shows that the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; threatened to spy on New Zealand if New Zealand didn't back down on its anti-nuclear legislation.

In 1984 after the New Zealand government passed laws that stop &lt;a href="w%3Anuclear-powered"&gt;nuclear-powered&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3Anuclear-armed"&gt;nuclear-armed&lt;/a&gt; ships from using New Zealand ports, the United States announced that it was stripping New Zealand of allied status until &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Navy"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt; ships were re-admitted to New Zealand ports.

Two moderate earthquakes occurred off the island of Nias, on the west Coast of Sumatra. The first earthquake at 5:47 am on Saturday was a 5.0 magnitude centered 30 km below the ocean floor. Twelve hours later the same magnitude quake occurred in the same area.

Neither quake caused any panic on the island that is located in an area of the Pacific Ocean known as "The Ring Of Fire"; panic wouldn't be unexpected because Indonesia was the scene of the Boxing Day 2004 tsumni. 

The area of the pacific ocean is referred to as "The Ring of Fire" because of several unstable fault lines located there, and any one is expected to cause a major quake bringing massive tidal waves to the coastlines encircling the pacific.

Nearly a month into the Winter season, much of Arizona has still not received rain or snow. Drought conditions have affected the state to varying degrees for the past 11 years, but 2006 looks to be the worst yet.

Rain and snowfall are typically most prevalent during January and February, but a high-pressure system has been keeping storms away from Arizona. Both are needed to refill the water reservoirs and keep forests healthy; if they continue to dry out under the current warm weather, it could cause an earlier fire season than usual.

The lack of rain will also increase farmers' demand on the water supply earlier in the year than usual and may cause problems if the summer monsoons also fail to arrive.

A peaceful protest in Sarajevo, lasting for several weeks so far, was ignited by a post on an online discussion board, Sarajevo-X. In a post named "Patriotism" one user, with nickname Stolac92, expressed his dissatisfaction with Bosnia today, writing among other things on December 22: "My heart hurts. It hurts because of all injustice, recklessness, theft... But what hurts the most is that we are quiet, we are tolerating, forgiving instead of doing something about it."

After receiving support from other forum members, the user proposed gathering in front of the Assembly building every day, starting from 5pm. The protests started the same weekend, and had been lasting since, with couple to several dozen people attending.

Forum members decided they will not support any particular political party, but to work for Bosnia and Herzegovina without political ethnic entities and to support policies which are fair to all citizens and punish criminals. They decided to use an open palm with a Bosnian map on it for their symbol, with word ♡❤Dosta♡❤ (Enough) as their slogan.

Bosnia and Herzegovina has been divided in two ethnic ethnities since the end of the war, the Serbian Republic and Federation of Bosniaks and Croats. Economic progress has been slow and created disparity between people.

Israeli media is reporting that Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AAriel%20Sharon"&gt;Ariel Sharon&lt;/a&gt; opened his eyes for the first time since he suffered a major stroke on January 4, 2006.

However, hospital officials said the reports were generated by the Sharon family's "impression of eyelid movement, whose medical significance is unclear."

"He was listening to a tape of his grandson and you could see tears in his eyes for a matter of seconds before he closed them again," a doctor treating Sharon told AFP news agency on condition of anonymity.

Army Radio, citing unidentified close associates of Sharon, say the Prime Minister could "recognize people around him." 

However, hospital officials state that it is "too early to tell whether the development represented a significant improvement or was just a temporary reflex."

Sharon had undergone a tracheotomy on Sunday to help with his breathing and to help prevent infection from his respirator tube.

&lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20Australia"&gt;Western Australian&lt;/a&gt; Premier, Dr &lt;a href="w%3AGeoff%20Gallop"&gt;Geoff Gallop&lt;/a&gt;, has resigned his post, to treat depression. 
Dr Gallop says the "debilitating" illness forced him to seek expert help last week. The 54-year-old became State Premier in 2001 and was re-elected in February last year.

In a media statement today, he said: 

♡❤"It is my difficult duty to inform you today that I am currently being treated for depression. Living with depression is a very debilitating experience, which affects different people in different ways. It has certainly affected many aspects of my life. So much so, that I sought expert help last week. My doctors advised me that with treatment, time and rest this illness is very curable. However, I cannot be certain how long I will need. So in the interests of my health and my family I have decided to rethink my career."♡❤

Dr Gallop says he will not do any further media interviews in the near future. The WA parliamentary Labor Party will decide on his successor. State Treasurer and Acting Premier, Eric Ripper, has cancelled his scheduled leave to act as Premier in the interim.

Dr Gallop was first elected to Parliament as the Member for Victoria Park in 1986. In today's statement he said: "In fact, what has made this announcement all the more difficult today is that I love being premier, I love the work, I love the state and I love its people.

Australian Federal Opposition Leader, &lt;a href="w%3AKim%20Beazley"&gt;Kim Beazley&lt;/a&gt; says Dr Gallop is a brilliant and innovative leader, who leaves Western Australia a far better place than he found it. He says Dr Gallop will be remembered for his decisions relating to WA's environment and education system, along with his vigorous pursuit of minerals development.

Federal deputy Labor leader &lt;a href="w%3AJenny%20Macklin"&gt;Jenny Macklin&lt;/a&gt; says Dr Gallop's departure is devastating. "For me, he's always been the most brilliant man, an extraordinary politician, a very lively and entertaining character," she said. "I think he's made an enormous contribution both to Western Australia but also to broader Australian politics."

Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; says all Australians will wish Dr Gallop and his family well for the future. "He worked very hard for the people of Western Australia as Premier," Mr Howard said in a statement. "Despite our political differences I always found it possible to work constructively with him."

The president of the WA branch of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Paul Skerrit, says he was shocked to hear of Dr Gallop's resignation. He says it shows depression can strike people in all kinds of jobs.

"Depression is a thing that smites people when they're in their prime and doing very well," he said.
"People think that you've got to have something wrong with you to get this illness but it's not the case at all."

Miami police officer Manny Gomez is in stable condition after falling from his horse during the Three Kings Parade. Gomez landed headfirst on the ground after the stallion lunged forward as he mounted it.

A veteran of the Miami Police Department for twenty years, Gomez is days away from retirement.

It is unknown at this time if he has any permanent spinal or back injuries.

&lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; has "barred" Time Warner Inc.'s, &lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;, from working in the country "until further notice" due to mistranslating comments made by Iran's President, &lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud%20Ahmadinejad"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt; during a press conference Saturday January 14, 2006.

In his speech Saturday, Ahmadinejad defended Iran's right to continue nuclear research.

State Media complained to CNN that they had used the translation "nuclear weapons" instead of "nuclear technology".

The ban by the Culture and Islamic Guidance Ministry was read in a statement on state-run television saying, "due to mistranslation of the words of Ahmadinejad during his press conference, activities of the American CNN in Tehran are banned until further notice," the statement said. "CNN quoted Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as saying that Iran has the right to build nuclear weapons," the network said in its report of the ban. "In fact he said that Iran has the right to nuclear energy." He then adds, "a nation that has civilization does not need nuclear weapons, and our nation does not need them."

CNN has acknowledged that they had made the mistake.

The network then went on to say, "CNN apologized on all its platforms which included the translation error, including CNN International, CNNUSA and CNN.com, and also expressed its regrets to the Iranian Government and the Iranian ambassador to the UN."

Mohammad Hossein Khoshvaght, director of foreign media at the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.ershad.gov.ir/barnameh.html"&gt;Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance&lt;/a&gt;, said on state television that he welcomed CNN's apology, but that "so far it's not clear whether it was something pre-planned or a mistake. Therefore, we will ban its activities (in Iran) for the time being. CNN's right to work in Iran would depend on an assessment of the broadcaster's future coverage of the Islamic state."

CNN has told its viewers that it has not yet been officially notified of the ban.

The &lt;a href="w%3AFree%20Software%20Foundation"&gt;Free Software Foundation&lt;/a&gt; released the first draft for the next version of the &lt;a href="w%3AGNU%20General%20Public%20License"&gt;GNU General Public License&lt;/a&gt; at the International Public Conference for GPLv3 in &lt;a href="w%3ACambridge%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Cambridge, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;, USA, today. The revisions mark the first changes to the GPL since the second version was released in 1991.

According to &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20M.%20Stallman"&gt;Richard M. Stallman&lt;/a&gt;, the president of the Free Software Foundation, the most significant change to the license are changes to allow GPLv3 to be compatible with other popular free software licenses, notably the Apache Software License 2.0 and the Eclipse license. A second significant change, according to Stallman, is the addition of a clause prohibiting the use of GPL software for &lt;a href="w%3ADigital%20rights%20management"&gt;Digital rights management&lt;/a&gt; (DRM), "something for which there can never be toleration."

As of noon EST today, the license is &lt;a href="http%3A//gplv3.fsf.org/draft"&gt;available in draft form&lt;/a&gt; on the Free Software Foundation's website. The &lt;a href="http%3A//web.mit.edu/conferences/www/software/sf_info.html"&gt;conference&lt;/a&gt; about the license, which continues now and into Tuesday, is being held in Building 10, Room 250, on the campus of the &lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology"&gt;Massachusetts Institute of Technology&lt;/a&gt;. Approximately 200 people attended the morning session of the conference, during which &lt;a href="w%3AEben%20Moglen"&gt;Eben Moglen&lt;/a&gt; gave what he called a "quick" 90 minute overview of the license changes.

While Moglen's presentation covered a great deal of legal detail, it was not without levity. When the cell phone of Dave Turner, an FSF staff member sitting in the front row, rang during Moglen's speech, Stallman broke in, requesting of the audience, "If you have brought in a portable tracking and surveillance device, you should turn it off," before making other remarks about the police.

The crowd at the conference included a large number of free software celebrities, including &lt;a href="w%3ABruce%20Perens"&gt;Bruce Perens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAndrew%20Tridgell"&gt;Andrew Tridgell&lt;/a&gt;, and Chris diBona. According to Wikinews reporter Brandon Stafford, it seemed that IBM and Sun were the corporations with the most employees present. Representing the companies were Bob Sutor, Craig Cook, and Mark Brown from IBM and Simon Phipps and Doug Johnson from Sun. Also in attendance were representatives from Intel, Redhat, MySQL AB, Hitachi, and Qualcomm, among others.

Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf has been inaugurated as &lt;a href="w%3ALiberia"&gt;Liberia's&lt;/a&gt; first &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AList%20of%20Female%20Presidents"&gt;elected female President&lt;/a&gt;, and also the first elected female head of state in Africa.

Her Vice President, also sworn in, is &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AJoseph%20Boakai"&gt;Joseph Boakai&lt;/a&gt;.

The inauguration took place in the country's capital, Monrovia and was attended by several key figures in world politics. The inauguration was attended by US Secretary of State &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ACondoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt;, US First Lady &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ALaura%20Bush"&gt;Laura Bush&lt;/a&gt;, and South African President &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AThabo%20Mbeki"&gt;Thabo Mbeki&lt;/a&gt;.

The inauguration was held out doors, as Liberia lacks any proper buildings for the event to have taken place in, including their capitol building which stood nearby. The BBC reports that guests sat on plastic patio chairs, and were shielded from the sun by palm matting.

Johnson-Sirleaf's address said "We know that your vote was a vote for change, a vote for peace, security and we have heard you loudly." She asked for a moment of silence for the thousands who died in Liberia's civil war.

Her victory was formally announced by the Liberian elections commission on 23rd November 2005 following the &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ALiberian%20elections%2C%202005"&gt;2005 election&lt;/a&gt;. In the second round of votes, her Unity Party received 59.4% of the vote, versus the 40.6% received for &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AGeorge%20Weah"&gt;George Weah&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ACongress%20for%20Democratic%20Change"&gt;Congress for Democratic Change&lt;/a&gt;.

Twenty one parties ran candidates in the election, with one independent also running. Voter turnout to the 2005 election was 74.9% in the first round, and 61.0% for the second.

Former United States President &lt;a href="w%3AGerald%20Ford"&gt;Gerald Ford&lt;/a&gt; has been hospitalized with pneumonia, an official announced today. Ford was admitted to the Eisenhower Medical Center in &lt;a href="w%3ARancho%20Mirage%2C%20California"&gt;Rancho Mirage, California&lt;/a&gt;, USA.

Ford's chief of staff, Penny Circle, said in a press release, "He is doing well and resting comfortably." She added that there would be no further announcements until 11 AM on Tuesday.

Ford visited the hospital last month for a routine test, which he goes for every December. Circle said he had "a horrible cold." Ford last visited the hospital in January 2005 for a follow-up on his annual December checkup.

Ford, 92, was the nation's 38th president. After the death of &lt;a href="w%3ARonald%20Regan"&gt;Ronald Regan&lt;/a&gt; in 2004, he became the oldest American president alive.

According to Norwegian and British newspaper sources, Jon Sudbø, a cancer researcher at the Norwegian Radium Hospital, fabricated at least 900 patient records in his research on NSAID drugs published in October of 2005 (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APubMed%20Identifier"&gt;PMID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https%3A//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez%3Fcmd%3Dretrieve%26db%3Dpubmed%26list_uids%3D16226613%26dopt%3DAbstract"&gt;16226613&lt;/a&gt; ). According to the now-discredited research, the class of drugs, commonly used for pain management, was found to decrease the risk of oral cancer but increase the risk of heart disease.

This field of research is important for the future use of Cox-2 drugs and was received with great interest by the United States Food and Drug Administration and other organizations involved in drug safety and efficacy.

Several other scientists put their name to the article in the Lancet but claim they were misled by Sudbø. The Lancet is publishing a retraction in its upcoming edition. Probes are underway both to investigate how this article passed peer review, and whether previous research by Sudbø was fraudulent.

Andrzej Marek, a &lt;a href="journalism"&gt;journalist&lt;/a&gt; working in the north-western town of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APolice%2C%20Poland"&gt;Police&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;a href="Poland"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;, began a three-month jail sentence on January 15 2006.

Marek is the editor of a regional weekly newspaper, the ♡❤Wiesci Polickie♡❤ (♡❤news from the town of Police♡❤). In February 2001, he published an article alleging that a local municipal employee, who privately ran an &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aadvertising"&gt;advertising&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; agency, had a conflict of interest in which he profited from his position to obtain business for his agency.

In November 2002, Marek was found guilty of defamation. Upon appeal in November 2003, he had the three-month prison sentence suspended on the condition that he apologise to the libellee. Marek refused to apologise and applied for a presidential pardon in March 2004. This was eventually refused. On March 23, 2004, a court in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASzczecin"&gt;Szczecin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; suspended the application of the sentence by six months due to problems with Marek's wife's pregnancy.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AReporters%20sans%20fronti%C3%A8res"&gt;Reporters sans frontières&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; claims that Poland is the only &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; country in which prison sentences are imposed for "offences of opinion" and that this is the first such occurrence in the EU. On July 18, 2003, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADorota%20Nieznalska"&gt;Dorota Nieznalska&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was sentenced to six months of community service for displaying a work of art that showed a penis on a cross. On January 5, 2005, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJerzy%20Urban"&gt;Jerzy Urban&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was fined 20,000 złoty (about 5000 euros) for having insulted &lt;a href="Pope%20John%20Paul%20II"&gt;Pope John Paul II&lt;/a&gt;, who qualified for legal protection against insults due to his role as a visiting &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ahead%20of%20state"&gt;head of state&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Neither of these penalties were prison sentences.

Polish websites are calling for appeals to the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHigh%20Commissioner%20for%20Human%20Rights"&gt;High Commissioner for Human Rights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; protesting the prison sentence.

The debate over whether Australians should be required to have a national identity card has been reignited following an announcement by Attorney-General Phillip Ruddock yesterday that a study will be conducted.

The concept is not new, being first floated by &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Hawke"&gt;Bob Hawke&lt;/a&gt; in 1986. The idea was abandoned after being defeated in the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Senate"&gt;Australian Senate&lt;/a&gt; and due to strong criticism.

The government cites terrorism and fraud protection as needs for a universal national identity system.

The opposition remains neutral on the proposal, saying only that cost and privacy would be major issues.

Defence Minister Robert Hill is cautious of such a plan, saying "I don't believe governments are entitled to any more information about you than is absolutely necessary".

The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which represents big business in Australia has voiced its opposition to the plan claiming the system could cost $750 per person to introduce, most of which would be borne by big business.

A male and a female took 3 people hostage at a law firm in &lt;a href="w%3AStatesboro%2C%20Georgia"&gt;Statesboro, Georgia&lt;/a&gt;. Police blocked off a part of this rural town on Monday. Two suspects , a man and a woman, took a lawyer hostage and claimed that they had explosives.

The suspects, Robert Eugene Brower, 43, a former client of the lawyer, and the female whose name was not released, gave up after demands for cigarettes and food were met and they spoke with a family member.

The standoff lasted for 24 hours and ended, "peacefully," at around 10AM said Larry Schnall, a spokesman for the Georgia State Patrol. 

The last of the 3 hostages to be released was identified as Michael Hostilo. He and the other two hostages were not injured. There is no word on the names of the other hostages.

Earlier reports stated that there had been a "loud boom" coming from the scene at about six o'clock this morning. Authorities have not stated what the booms were.

Police are now inside the building to locate and defuse the explosive device that the suspects claimed to have had.

Initially when police arrived, there were 3 hostages, but 2 had been recently released and were unharmed, said Maggie Fitzgerald, a city spokeswoman. "They are upset with some legal issues within the recent past and want to get those issues resolved. We are doing everything possible to end this situation without anyone being hurt."

In a news conference Monday night, Police Chief Stan York said Brower was angry about "having been convicted in a criminal case", in which the lawyer was his court-appointed attorney. York did not elaborate on the demands of the hostage-takers, other than saying, "they only wanted to call attention to the case."

Georgia State Trooper Larry Schnall, a spokesman for the Georgia State Patrol, said a SWAT team was sent to the scene. 

This morning authorities convinced the two suspects to give-up, but "incidents leading to an escalation resulted in some gunfire," Stan York in a press conference just moments ago. No one was hurt in the brief eruption of gunfire. 

Police later said when the suspects tried to surrender they became apprehensive and made a threatening gesture prompting authorities to draw their guns and open fire.

The standoff began at around 9AM on Monday.

A U.S. F-15 fighter aircraft crashed into the ocean early Tuesday approximately 45 miles off the coast of Ikeijima island, part of the Okinawa chain. The aircraft was stationed at the Kadena air base.

The pilot, whose name was not released, ejected safely and was rescued.

The cause of the crash is under investigation.

An Australian terrorism expert says he has evidence, which could show &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Qaeda"&gt;Al Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href="w%3AOsama%20bin%20Laden"&gt;Osama bin Laden&lt;/a&gt; is either seriously ill or dead. 

Professor Clive Williams, director of terrorism studies at the Australian National University, says he has been provided with evidence, by an Indian colleague, to support the theory that bin Laden died of massive organ failure in April last year.

Professor Williams says &lt;a href="w%3AAyman%20al%20Zawahiri"&gt;Ayman al Zawahiri&lt;/a&gt;, bin Laden's deputy, has been making all statements on behalf of Al Qaeda for around a year. 

Al Zawahiri is believed to have been the target of a strike in Pakistan last week which killed at least 18 people in a remote Pakistani tribal village, the second such unexplained attack near the volatile Afghan border within a week.

However, Professor Williams says it may be impossible to ever prove if Osama bin Laden, accused of plotting the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon building in the U.S., is alive or dead. 

"It's hard to prove or disprove these things because there hasn't really been anything that allows you to make a judgement one way or the other," he said. "But it does seem strange that Dr Zawahiri has been making all of the statements since then, and nothing's been heard from Bin Laden since I think the December of the year before."

He says even if bin Laden was dead, it would not make much difference - as people would continue to fight for the things they believe he stood for. He has also recommended against confirming his death or otherwise.

Professor Williams, the Visiting Fellow at the Australian National University's Strategic and Defence Studies Centre said the information, which came from a former Indian intelligence officer whom he would not identify, was credible but impossible to confirm. 

"It does seem reasonably convincing based on the evidence that I've been provided with that he's certainly either severely incapacitated or dead at this stage," Dr Williams said. 

But he said, "Even if he's dead, it will be almost impossible for Western authorities to prove it. It may simply be that we don't hear much about Bin Laden again ... [or] he may pop up again in six months' time and make a new statement, at which case, of course, we will go back to Square1."

Al-Qaeda in Iraq leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's actions in targeting Shi'ites in Iraq were another factor raising doubt that bin Laden was still leading al-Qaeda. Bin Laden had promoted a pan-Islamic vision and had tried, unsuccessfully, to attract Shi'a Muslims to al-Qaeda.

"From what I have read, Zarqawi had a great deal of respect for bin Laden, so it would seem unlikely that he would be doing that if bin Laden was still around," said Williams. There was also the question of how long an ill man like bin Laden, who walked with a cane and suffered from a kidney disease, would survive in the tribal areas of Pakistan, where he was thought to be hiding.

However, the United States believes Bin Laden still alive. Osama Bin Laden and his deputy are thought to be living in the area of a missile strike apparently aimed at Ayman al-Zawahiri, said US counter-terrorism ambassador Henry Crumpton. He said the al-Qaeda leader and his number two were believed to be in the Pakistan-Afghanistan border region.

The US has not commented on the attack on a Pakistan village on Friday that killed 18 civilians. US media said the attack was carried out by the CIA. Thousands of Pakistanis later staged anti-American demonstrations.

&lt;a href="w%3AManchester%20United"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt; manager &lt;a href="w%3AAlex%20Ferguson"&gt;Alex Ferguson&lt;/a&gt; and striker &lt;a href="w%3AWayne%20Rooney"&gt;Wayne Rooney&lt;/a&gt; will face an inquiry from the &lt;a href="w%3AFootball%20Association"&gt;Football Association&lt;/a&gt; after they were witnessed by over 40 fans, including TV crews, swearing at referee Alan Bennett. After a string of decisions (which the red half of Manchester perceived to be unfair) being given in &lt;a href="w%3AManchester%20City"&gt;City&lt;/a&gt;'s favour, and with the untimely booking of &lt;a href="w%3AChristiano%20Ronaldo"&gt;Ronaldo&lt;/a&gt;, both Ferguson and Rooney were pushed to their limits of patience, swearing out loud in disbelief.

Rooney was first to be heard mouthing off after the decision was taken to give Ronaldo his marching orders. He was observed swearing at the referee at half time, and then continuing the tirade throughout the game as a string of bad decisions were taken which stripped United of their fluidity in the game. Despite the language from Rooney being far from usual, a barrage of assaults were thrown to and from the referee and the striker right through the game.

After the decision was given to take off Christiano Ronaldo, Ferguson's temper boiled and he was heard by many sitting around him to call the referee a "f*cking tw*t" as well as calling his decisions a "f*cking disgrace". This later led on to Ferguson launching threats at the referee during half time, and accusing the referee of not being able to handle under the pressure of a premiership game as well as questioning his judgement of the offside rule.

Ferguson himself admitted that Ronaldo's tackle was rash, and also noted that the side seemed to get better after he had been sent off, saying that they were playing better with 10 men. He still maintained that the side defended well, despite the fact that new signing &lt;a href="w%3APatrice%20Evra"&gt;Patrice Evra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMikael%20Silvestre"&gt;Mikael Silvestre&lt;/a&gt; afforded City easy opportunities to slip goals in.

The fine that both Ferguson and Rooney will receive is unknown, although it is thought to be similar to the ban he received in 2003, in which he received a 3 match touchline-ban, and a £100,000 after swearing at &lt;a href="w%3AJeff%20Winter"&gt;Jeffery Winter&lt;/a&gt;.

Reports from Pakistan say that at least four or five terrorists were killed in last Friday's airstrike. The attack took place in the village of Damadola in the semi-autonomous agency of &lt;a href="w%3ABajur"&gt;Bujar&lt;/a&gt;, a tribal region bordering &lt;a href="w%3AAfghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;.

According to unnamed Pakistani intelligence officials, top Al-Queda operative &lt;a href="w%3AAyman%20al-Zawahiri"&gt;Ayman al-Zawahiri&lt;/a&gt; was invited to a dinner in the village at the time of the strike, but failed to show up.

"According to the available information at least 4 to 5 foreign elements had also been killed in the incident," the Political Agent Fahim Wazir of Bujar said Tuesday. He added that 10 to 12 foreign extremists had been invited to dinner at the compound that Zawahiri was supposed to attend, but did not show up and that the "dead bodies have been taken away by their companions to hide the real reason of the attack." 

This is the first official statement by Pakistani authorities indicating that foreign militants were killed in the attack, which officials have said also killed innocent civilians. Women and children were among the 18 people that were killed in the airstrike. "It is regrettable that 18 local people lost their lives in the attack, but this fact also cannot be denied, that 10 - 12 foreign extremists had been invited on a dinner," the statement also said.

There has been no announcement regarding the names of those terrorists killed and DNA tests are still being done on the victims to make a final decision. Media reports say that most if not all of the terrorists were Egyptian.

U.S. news networks have reported that, according to unidentified intelligence officials, the attack was carried out by unmanned drone aircraft which launched missiles at the target location.

In the wake of two days of protests that erupted across Pakistan after the strike, the ruling party demanded an apology from the United States. 
The protesters are opposing the government participation in the U.S.-led war on terror, and the recent series of U.S. attacks along the frontier that killed civilians. Shahid Shamsi, a spokesman for the anti-American religious coalition that organized the rallies announced more and bigger protests in the days to come. He said "Pakistani civilians, including children, were killed," and explained that "principles cannot be broken in the name of (fighting) terrorism."

Yesterday the President of &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud%20Ahmadinejad"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt;, stated in a letter to the Cultural Ministry, the country was banning all work of &lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; (Cable News Network), which is owned by &lt;a href="w%3ATime%20Warner%20Inc."&gt;Time Warner Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, for making a translation error during a press conference on Saturday.

However, today Ahmadinejad announced that Iran was lifting the ban. Apparently late Monday, Ahmadinejad had asked the Cultural Ministry to lift the ban after CNN apologized for their error.

"I want the channel to be allowed to resume its work owing to the apology it made," Ahmadinejad said in a letter sent to the Culture Ministry.

"Following a request from President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the ban on the activities of CNN's stringer in Iran was lifted," Mohammad Hossein Khoshvaght, director of foreign media at Iran's Culture Ministry, told the media.

Less than 24 hours ago Iran had banned CNN from the country for misquoting the president as speaking of "nuclear weapons" when he actually spoke of "nuclear technology" during Saturdays press conference.

&lt;a href="w%3AClarence%20Ray%20Allen"&gt;Clarence Ray Allen&lt;/a&gt;, convicted of ordering a hit in 1980 that resulted in the deaths of the target and two bystanders, was executed just after his 76th birthday, making him the second-oldest man in U.S. history to be executed. He had been in prison for ordering the murder of his son's girlfriend when he ordered the hit that resulted in the death penalty conviction. However, appeals caused him to remain on death row for 23 years. 

His lawyers had attempted to make the case that it would be cruel and unusual to execute the man, attempting to save his life under the &lt;a href="w%3AEighth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution"&gt;Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution&lt;/a&gt;. However, the courts rejected the appeal, and the Supreme Court refused to hear the case, upholding the death penalty conviction.

Anti-whaling protesters have joined forces across &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.A&lt;/a&gt; calling for an end to the killing of whales for meat by &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;. Greenpeace organised the international day of action as it continued its efforts to disrupt the hunting of minke whales by the Japanese whaling fleet currently in the &lt;a href="Southern%20Ocean"&gt;Southern Ocean&lt;/a&gt;. 

The day of action was being marked to protest the actions of the fleet which protesters believe violate the 1986 &lt;a href="International%20Whaling%20Commission"&gt;International Whaling Commission&lt;/a&gt; (IWC) global ban on commercial whaling. Japan's JARPA Japanese Whale Research Program was allowed to operate under a Special Permit in the Antarctic according to Article VIII of the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling. In its JARPA-2 plan, Japan plans to double its annual scientific research catch of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMinke%20whales"&gt;Minke whales&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to 935, and to add 10 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFin%20whales"&gt;Fin whales&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to its quota. The &lt;a href="International%20Fund%20for%20Animal%20Welfare"&gt;International Fund for Animal Welfare&lt;/a&gt; states that over the next two years, Japan plans to kill 50 endangered &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHumpback%20whales"&gt;Humpback whales&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and an additional 40 fin whales.

<h2>International Anti-Whaling Protesters' Day of Action</h2>

Numerous reports of actions taken in Australia and New Zealand focused on public awareness of the Japanese whaling efforts and collecting signatures of people opposed to whaling.

<h3>Australia</h3>

At Sydney's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABondi%20Beach"&gt;Bondi Beach&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , anti-whaling campaigners asked bathers to sign a dozen metre-high cardboard whale tails placed in the sand and called for an end to whaling in the Southern Ocean. Signatures from a Sydney petition would be added to tens of thousands collected elsewhere in the country. They will be handed to the Australian government and Japanese consulate in June.

Waverley mayor Mora Main urged Japanese tourists who enjoyed whale watching in Australia to pressure their government to end whaling.

In Melbourne, protesters collected hundreds of signatures on a seven metre long fabric whale to take to the Japanese consulate. Campaigner Simon Bradshaw said up to 300 people signed the whale within 15 minutes at Flinders Street station.

"Australia is pretty much unequivocally opposed to the whaling hunt on environmental grounds as well as animal rights grounds," Mr Bradshaw said. "People have been rather disturbed and horrified (by the whaling), so I think they're grateful to be given even a small thing they can do to express their opposition to it."

Signatures were also collected in Brisbane and Hobart. In the Tasmanian capital, about 50 people were applauded by bystanders as they marched through the city centre, chanting slogans and waving placards against whaling. Protest organiser Jessica Sheldrick says it is part of a national day of action in four capital cities to educate people about whaling in Australia's Southern Oceans.

"Basically, we're here to support our activists that are down there endangering their lives, just to save our marine mammals," Ms Sheldrick said. "People are, on the whole, totally in support of Greenpeace's stance in whaling in the Southern Oceans. They don't believe it should be happening."

<h3>New Zealand</h3>

In New Zealand, whaling has been condemned at an Auckland beach protest. A mock graveyard of black minke whale tails, symbolic of those killed in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary, was displayed on an Auckland beach. 

Greenpeace New Zealand say the tails represent the more than 900 whales killed by Japan this season. More than 100 people turned up at Mission Bay beach to mark the International Day of Action against Whaling. Around 250 wooden whale tails were placed in the sand and a giant whale tail of sand was made on the beach by children and their parents. 

The New Zealand Greens Party say diplomatic measures have failed to stop the whaling and the government should explore legal options, including the Antarctic Treaty which allows observers to inspect research ships.

<h2>Whaling conflict in the Southern Ocean</h2>

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASouthern%20Ocean%20Sanctuary"&gt;Southern Ocean Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was designated by the IWC as a sanctuary for whales in 1994.

Japan abandoned &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWhaling%20in%20Japan"&gt;commercial whaling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 1986, in line with an international moratorium, yet resumed whaling the following year for what it says is "scientific research". Japan's whaling program includes fin and humpback whales, both of which are on the &lt;a href="World%20Conservation%20Union"&gt;World Conservation Union&lt;/a&gt;'s list of threatened species.

Japan's &lt;a href="Institute%20of%20Cetacean%20Research"&gt;Institute of Cetacean Research&lt;/a&gt; says its whaling is legal and scientifically necessary for sustainable resource management.

International Whaling Commission rules permit the research hunt, but Australia and other anti-whaling countries say it is commercial whaling in disguise as the meat collected from the "research" is later sold in Japan. Critics say Japan is off-loading whale meat for consumption in restaurants and supermarkets.

<h3>International views of whaling today</h3>

Meanwhile, Australia, Britain, Brazil, France and Germany were among 17 countries calling on Japan this week, to halt to its Antarctic whaling program. "The fact that 17 countries supported this representation, shows how important this issue is, and the depth of feeling around the world," British fisheries minister Ben Bradshaw said in a statement.

The statement calls on Japan to "cease all its lethal scientific research on whales," and was delivered to Japan's foreign and farm ministries.

"We urge Japan to reconsider its positions and end this unjustified and unnecessary slaughter which is regarded by many countries as a means to by-pass the IWC (International Whaling Commission) moratorium," Bradshaw said.

Other signatories of the statement were Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Mexico, New Zealand, Portugal, Spain and Sweden.

<h3>Japans view of the issues</h3>
Japan opposes a ban on whaling, insisting it is part of the country's traditional culture, and has continued to hunt whales for scientific research since the International Whaling Commission introduced a moratorium on commercial whaling in 1986.

More than 6,800 Antarctic Minke Whales have already been killed in Antarctic waters since Japan began its Whale Research Program 18 years ago. Meat from whales killed for research is later consumed at Japanese restaurants. 

The Japanese government has defended its whaling activities, saying that whales are caught for research purposes only. They have also said that they are not breaking international law, in a statement issued by Chief Cabinet Secretary &lt;a href="Shinzo%20Abe"&gt;Shinzo Abe&lt;/a&gt;.

"I understand that Japan's research whaling follows international rules and is done for the purpose of research on whales' ecosystem," Chief Cabinet Secretary Shinzo Abe, the government spokesman, told reporters.

The Japanese whaling industry's Institute of Cetacean Research (ICR) claim serious violations of maritime laws during the recent anti-whaling actions. "Already, there are serious violations that provide reasons for concern in terms of safety and international maritime law," ICR director-general Dr Hiroshi Hatanaka said in a statement.

The ICR said Greenpeace had not stopped the whaling fleet from conducting its research. "The issue of sound management and sustainability of whale stocks are far too important to be sidetracked by a D grade public relations campaign," Dr Hatanaka said.

Gavin Carter, an adviser to the ICR, a nonprofit Japanese research organisation, said Japanese quotas for whale kills are well below the mammals' reproductive rates.
"The purpose of this research," said Mr Carter, "is to create a knowledge bank, which the government can then use to facilitate a regulated whaling industry." Mr Carter urged critics of commercial whaling to be sensitive to other nations' cultural differences, noting that Japanese have "used whales for centuries. They eat the whole thing. They use every part. Who are we to tell them what to eat, or what not to kill?" he asked.
<h3>Green Peace's actions</h3>
The &lt;a href="Greenpeace"&gt;Greenpeace&lt;/a&gt; vessel Arctic Sunrise has been shadowing the Japanese whaling fleet for several weeks in a bid to disrupt Japan's annual whale hunt, prompting many heated exchanges. Canadian activist Texas Constantine was thrown out of a small inflatable boat that had been manoeuvring between a harpooner and a minke whale. He spent several minutes in the icy waters before being hauled back on board. 

The harpoon killed the minke whale and its tow rope threw into the water Greenpeace activist Joe Constantine, who was able to climb back aboard the boat to safety, the environmental watchdog said.

"We were out defending the whales. We had been out there for about an hour. I was driving our boat and we were in a good position and the whaler fired its harpoon," Constantine said in a statement. "All of a sudden the harpoon line came down on us trapping us between the whale and the catcher," he said. "The line came tight at that point and threw me from the boat into the water. It was a few minutes before our boat was able to come over and pick me up out of the water."

The Institute of Cetacean Research in Tokyo accused Greenpeace of taking increasing risks in harassing the whaling fleet. "The fact that the rope fell onto their inflatable and one of the activists fell into the water is entirely their fault," the institute's director general Hiroshi Hatanaka said Sunday.

Currently, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AArsenal%20F.C."&gt;Arsenal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AManchester%20United"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChelsea%20F.C."&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have put in bids for the player, although he admits that he wants to transfer to his childhood dream-club, Arsenal.

Walcott and his family are keen to take his current skills to an even higher plataeu, and feel that only this kind of skill could be achieved with Arsenal, despite the fact that other clubs have offered to outbid Arsenal. He is likely to make the move to Arsenal's squad when his current contract runs out on his 17th Birthday. 

Arsenal manager &lt;a href="Arsene%20Wenger"&gt;Arsene Wenger&lt;/a&gt; is as happy about the move as Walcott himself is. Despite the fact Southampton has released no details of the proceedings, Wenger let slip that the deal was almost done, after revealing he was buying "two and a half" players; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEmmanuel%20Abedayor"&gt;Emmanuel Abedayor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAbo%20Daiby"&gt;Abo Daiby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;mdash; Walcott being referred to has the "half". When interviewed on his interest in the striker, he revealed that he had been watching him and was a big admirer

The abductors of American journalist &lt;a href="w%3AJill%20Carroll"&gt;Jill Carroll&lt;/a&gt; released today a silent 20-second video of the abducted journalist on &lt;a href="w%3AAl-Jazeera"&gt;Al-Jazeera&lt;/a&gt; television news channel. Along with the video came a statement demanding the United States release all female prisoners in Iraq within 72 hours or they will kill her. Al-Jazeera has not revealed where the video was sent from.

In the video, Carroll is seated in front of a white background, apparently speaking, although the tape contained no sound. She appears pale and tired with long brown hair parted in the middle and pulled back from her face.

Carroll is a 28-year old freelance reporter working for the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20Science%20Monitor"&gt;Christian Science Monitor&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ newspaper in Iraq since October 2003. She was kidnapped on January 7 in one of Baghdad's most dangerous neighborhoods. Just after leaving the office of a &lt;a href="w%3ASunni%20Arab"&gt;Sunni Arab&lt;/a&gt; politician, Adnan al-Dulaimi, her car was ambushed by gunmen who killed her Iraqi translator. The driver got away unharmed as he was pulled from the car by the gunmen who then drove away with the vehicle.

Carroll's family has issued a statement pleading for mercy. Both Al-Jazeera and the editors of the Boston, Massachusetts-based paper have also called for her safe release. 

According to &lt;a href="w%3AReporters%20Without%20Borders"&gt;Reporters Sans Frontieres&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3AParis%2C%20France"&gt;Paris, France&lt;/a&gt;-based advocacy group, Carroll is the latest of 31 journalists to be abducted in Iraq since the war began in March 2003. Six journalists have been killed by abductors, according to the &lt;a href="w%3ACommittee%20to%20Protect%20Journalists"&gt;Committee to Protect Journalists&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="Australian%20Senate"&gt;Australian Senate&lt;/a&gt; has been flooded with submissions into an inquiry about the possible use of the abortion drug &lt;a href="Mifepristone"&gt;Mifepristone&lt;/a&gt; (known as RU486) in &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;.

The senate committee is to consider a private members bill, introduced by a group of female senators and MPs to strip the Australian health minister of his control over the drug. If successful, the drug would then have to be approved by the Threrapeutic Goods Administration before it would be allowed to be used in Australia.

Senator Fiona Nash of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;Nationals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; argues that the bill is not about abortion but about process. She said "What's been put forward here is who is best able to judge the quality, safety and efficacy of this particular drug and who is best able to judge whether it should be used in Australia".

Ms Nash believes that the TGA should be responsible for allowing or denying the use of drugs in Australia, not the health minister.

Lyn Elisson, leader of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Democrats"&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said that only around 2,000 of the submissions would be considered as the remainder do not meet the senate's terms of reference. She also said "This bill is not about the morality or legality of abortion.

"It's really about whether the Minister for Health should have the power of veto over an alternative to legal surgical abortion."

National's senator Barnaby Joyce argues that all opinions should be taken into account and that the enquiry should be conducted for at least a week.

Peter Slipper, MP for the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;Liberal party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; claims that the proposed legislation can not be separated from the RU486 issue. He told ABC radio "I believe it would be a negation of our responsibility if we were to flick the decision to an unelected body, an unaccountable body, such as the TGA."

It is believed that only 100 submissions are from those supporting the use of RU486.

The inquiry has received international attention with submissions from the US, New Zealand and Austria.
This pill has been available for use in France since 1988, in Switzerland since 1999.

More than 40 asylum seekers are missing after fleeing the Indonesian province of Papua, bound for Australia. Coastwatch is searching the Torres Strait for the 25m boat. Four children are among the 43 people believed to be on board. The 25-metre traditional boat is believed to have left the port of Merauke, Papua, on Friday headed for Australia's Cape York peninsula.

Convenor of the Australia West Papua Association Louise Byrne says the group included some of Papua's leading independence advocates. She said they were forced to undertake the journey by boat because the usual means of escaping Papua – crossing the border into Papua New Guinea – had become increasingly difficult. 

"The border has tightened up a lot in recent times," she said on ABC radio. Ms Byrne said sheer desperation had forced the group to flee Papua. "Although it hasn't been announced, I think the Indonesian Government has changed its policy and is now realising that ... autonomy isn't working and I think they're about to implement a military solution," she said.

Ms Byrne could not say whether she believed Australian authorities should prepare for an influx of asylum seekers from the region. Ms Byrne was told of the group's escape from Papua in a phone call last week. She said fears were growing for the safety of those on board the boat, which was now three days overdue.

"They're not anywhere, so I'm concerned for where they are and that's why the National Search and Rescue have started looking this morning," Ms Byrne said. "We've been spending a rather frantic weekend looking for them because it's not far across the Torres Strait," she said. "It should have taken them a maximum of 15, 16 hours."

The Australian immigration department says surveillance flights in the Torres Strait have failed to locate the boat. A department spokesman says Coastwatch surveillance flights in the Torres Strait region have been adjusted to search for the boat but it has not been sighted. 

Australian Greens Senator Kerry Nettle has written to Foreign Minister Downer requesting that he make inquiries with the Indonesian Government to establish if they have intercepted the missing asylum seekers. 

"I am concerned that the boat carrying West Papuan asylum seekers could have been intercepted by Indonesian authorities en route to Australia," said Senator Nettle. "If the Indonesians have intercepted this boat it would be a relief that they have not sunk at sea, but I am concerned about their fate at the hands of Indonesian authorities given recent arrests of West Papuan activists and ongoing human rights abuses. 

Aboriginal communities in Cape York are being put on alert. Federal and Queensland Government authorities are monitoring the situation.

In a forceful speech Monday, former Vice President &lt;a href="Al%20Gore"&gt;Al Gore&lt;/a&gt; criticized the use of unwarranted domestic &lt;a href="w%3Awiretaps"&gt;wiretaps&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href="National%20Security%20Agency"&gt;National Security Agency&lt;/a&gt;.

Gore called the wiretapping program, which the &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; insists is vital to the defense of America, "a threat to the very structure of our government" and urged the &lt;a href="Alberto%20Gonzales"&gt;Attorney General&lt;/a&gt; to appoint a special counsel for investigation into the matter. He additionally recommended Congress to hold comprehensive hearings and for telecommunications companies who are assisting in the program to stop doing so, and suggested the administration is using the threat of terrorism as a means to amass power in the executive branch.
"Is America in more danger now than when we faced worldwide fascism on the march - when our fathers fought and won two World Wars simultaneously?" He added, "Once violated, the rule of law is in danger. Unless stopped, lawlessness grows. The greater the power of the executive grows, the more difficult it becomes for the other branches to perform their constitutional roles."

The &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20National%20Committee"&gt;Republican National Committee&lt;/a&gt; responded to Gore's statements, saying, "Al Gore's incessant need to insert himself in the headline of the day is almost as glaring as his lack of understanding of the threats facing America." They continued, "While the president works to protect Americans from terrorists, Democrats deliver no solutions of their own, only diatribes laden with inaccuracies and anger."

On Tuesday, White House press secretary &lt;a href="w%3AScott%20McClellan"&gt;Scott McClellan&lt;/a&gt; also responded, saying that the &lt;a href="Bill%20Clinton"&gt;Clinton&lt;/a&gt; administration had authorized an &lt;a href="FBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; search of double agent &lt;a href="w%3AAldrich%20Ames"&gt;Aldrich Ames&lt;/a&gt; without a warrant. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales made similar remarks earlier. Regarding Gore, McClellan said, "I think his hypocrisy knows no bounds."

Opponents of the wiretapping program say this is an inaccurate comparison. On Monday's edition of Larry King Live, New York Times reporter James Risen said that "under the rules at that time the Attorney General could authorize a warrantless physical search of a house. After the Ames case," he added, "Congress changed that and closed that loophole and so that now that kind of search couldn't be done under the law."

Responding to the White House and Attorney General's comments, Gore said, "The Attorney General is making a political defense of the President without even addressing the substantive legal questions that have so troubled millions of Americans in both political parties. There are...problems with the Attorney General's effort to focus attention on the past instead of the present Administration's behavior. [As] others have thoroughly documented, his charges are factually wrong. Both before and after the &lt;a href="w%3AForeign%20Intelligence%20Surveillance%20Act"&gt;Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act&lt;/a&gt; was amended in 1995, the Clinton/Gore Administration complied fully and completely with the terms of the law."

An inquiry began this week in Sydney into whether Australian companies paid bribes to Saddam Hussein during the UN Oil-for-food programme. 

The inquiry was set up by Prime Minister John Howard, after allegations last year that the Australian Wheat Board paid US$220m in bribes to the Iraqi government. The terms of reference of the inquiry are restricted to the AWB and two other companies.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;'s coastwatch has found a missing boat which with more than 40 passengers after it had left &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3APapua%20%28Indonesian%20province%29"&gt;Papua&lt;/a&gt; province, reportedly bound for Australia. 

Initial reports say the vessel has been spotted off &lt;a href="w%3ACape%20York"&gt;Cape York&lt;/a&gt;, three days after it was reported missing. The Australia West Papua Association (AWPA) says the boat was carrying people who left for security reasons as a campaign against Indonesian rule of the Melanesian province continues. 

Any application for possible asylum can only be submitted to the Australian authorities if they reach the Australian mainland. Australia operates a detention centre in &lt;a href="w%3ANauru"&gt;Nauru&lt;/a&gt; to process people intercepted at sea while trying to reach Australia illegally.

The AWPA said the group had been forced to flee Papua by boat because the usual way of leaving the province — by crossing the eastern border into &lt;a href="w%3APapua%20New%20Guinea"&gt;Papua New Guinea&lt;/a&gt; — had been made more difficult by increased surveillance. "No one (has) come from West Papua in boats before like this, seeking political asylum," said a spokesperson for AWPA.

Fears for the safety of the asylum-seekers mounted over the weekend after the group failed to turn up on Australia's Cape York Peninsula after leaving Papua's Merauke port on Friday morning.

The group had reportedly been making the 250 kilometre journey across the Torres Strait in a 25-metre traditional boat. 

"A vessel fitting the information reported was located by Coastwatch at about 2pm at Cape York," an immigration department spokeswoman told AFP.

Customs and government officials were on their way to meet the boat, she added.

Heavy selling in internet firm &lt;a href="w%3Alivedoor"&gt;livedoor&lt;/a&gt; sparked a sharp selloff in Japanese stocks Wednesday. The exchange had to shorten the trading session as the number of transactions threatened to exceed the system capacity. The Tokyo stock exchange has a capacity to handle 4.5 million trades per day.

Wednesday's trading problems have added to recent woes with the trading system at the exchange. A glitch halted trading for almost a full day late last year. Tokyo stock exchange plans to offer its own shares for listing.

Prosecutors raided the Tokyo offices of livedoor on Monday, following allegations the company had violated Japanese securities laws.
livedoor has denied that the company broke market rules by giving misleading information to shareholders. Shares in the company dived on Tuesday, dragging the overall index lower. One of Japan's best known internet companies, livedoor has grown rapidly through a series of takeovers and stock splits before Tuesday's share price fall.
