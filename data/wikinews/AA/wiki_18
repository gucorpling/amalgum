&lt;a href="w%3ADana%20Reeve"&gt;Dana Reeve&lt;/a&gt;, the widow of &lt;a href="w%3AChristopher%20Reeve"&gt;Christopher Reeve&lt;/a&gt;, died of lung cancer late Monday. She was 44.

Reeve served as chairwoman of the Christopher Reeve Foundation and founded the Christopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis Resource Center. She and her late husband, famed for his movie acting role of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASuperman%3A%20The%20Movie"&gt;Superman&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, became advocates for &lt;a href="w%3Aparaplegia"&gt;paraplegics&lt;/a&gt; when he suffered a spinal injury in 1995 that left him paralyzed after falling off a horse. Christopher Reeve died in 2004.

Kathy Lewis, President and CEO of the foundation said in a statement to the media, "On behalf of the entire Board of Directors and staff of the Christopher Reeve Foundation, we are extremely saddened by the death of Dana Reeve, whose grace and courage under the most difficult of circumstances was a source of comfort and inspiration to all of us."

Reeve, who was not a smoker, announced in 2005 that she had lung cancer.

Reeve is survived by her 13-year-old son, Will; a step-daughter, Alexandra; a step-son, Matthew; her father, Dr. Charles Morosini; and sisters Deborah Morosini and Adrienne Morosini Heilman.

At least 15 people are feared dead and at least 60 others are wounded after three explosions in the &lt;a href="w%3AHindu"&gt;Hindu&lt;/a&gt; pilgrimage town of &lt;a href="w%3AVaranasi"&gt;Varanasi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;. 

At approximately 1230 UTC/0730 EST, the first explosion occurred outside the crowded Sankat Mochan temple. The second took place just minutes later at the Cantonment Railway Station, leaving a crater just outside the stationmaster's room, and the third occurred on the Shiv Ganga Express, which had been leaving for &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Delhi%2C%20India"&gt;New Delhi&lt;/a&gt;.

Officials say that the area has been cordoned off and the injured have been shifted to a hospital on the Benaras Hindu University campus. They also report that at least four unexploded bombs were found near a holy site by the &lt;a href="w%3AGanges%20River"&gt;Ganges River&lt;/a&gt;.

According to media advisor Sanjay Baru, Prime Minister Manmohan "has appealed for peace and calm. He is constantly monitoring the situation."

At least eight cars and a tanker have crashed on &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Route%2027"&gt;U.S. Route 27&lt;/a&gt; near West Palm Beach, &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;. At least five people have been injured and no fatalities were been reported.

A gasoline tanker was in an accident with a flat-bed semi when several vehicles collided with the tanker. At least one semi has burst into flames.

Fire Rescue Capt. Don DeLucia said that "Severe fog might have caused the accident and hampered crews from getting there."

Both lanes of traffic were shutdown for several hours.

After this weekend, Texas can celebrate not only bringing home the Big 12 Conference trophy but also having the All-Big 12 Player of the Year, P.J. Tucker, and the first recipient of the Defensive Player of the Year award, LaMarcus Aldridge.

Rival Kansas, who tied with Texas for the No. 1 slot in the conference but was denied the trophy, had coach Bill Self named Coach of the Year and Brandon Rush named Freshman of the Year. Michael Neal of Oklahoma was named Newcomer of the Year.

The All-Big 12 awards are selected by the league's head coaches, who are not allowed to vote for their own players. 

Tucker, a unanimous All-Big 12 First Team choice, is the first Longhorn to earn Big 12 Player of the Year recognition. He leads the team and ranks sixth overall in the conference in scoring (16.1), while leading the league in rebounding (9.0). He is also fourth in field goal percentage with a .531 mark. He has led UT in scoring seven times in league play and is second in the Big 12 overall with 10 double-doubles. 

Aldridge wins the first defensive honor awarded by the Big 12. He is first in the Big 12 with 59 blocks overall, including 27 in conference games. He has 81 defensive rebounds in 2005-06, ranking third in the league. Aldridge can score as well, leading the Big 12 with 13 double-doubles. 

Neal is the second-straight Sooner and fourth overall to win Newcomer of the Year. One of the top long-range threats in the Big 12, the junior college transfer ranks first in conference games in 3-point field goal percentage (.495) and 3-point field goals per game (3.86). He is also averaging a team-best 14.8 points in league action. He has shot 50.0 percent or better from beyond the arc 11 times this season. 

Rush is the first freshman in conference history to be named to the All-Big 12 First Team. The top scoring freshman in the conference with 15.1 points per game, Rush also ranks seventh with a 6.6 rebounding average. He is the fourth KU player to surpass 400 points (408) in his freshman season. The native of Kansas City, Mo. is the second Jayhawk to win freshman accolades (Jeff Boschee, 1998-99). 

Self wins his first Big 12 coaching honor and the third for a Jayhawk mentor. After returning just 21.2 percent of his scoring from a year ago, Self guided KU to a share of the Big 12 regular season championship, its sixth in league annals. Starting three freshmen and two sophomores, Kansas recorded its 18th straight season with at least 22 victories. 

The All-Big 12 First, Second, Third and Honorable Mention teams were also announced, while conference coaches also selected All-Defensive and All-Rookie Teams for the first time.

All across the Canadian province of Ontario, college teachers have gone on strike, leaving more than 150,000 students in 24 colleges without classes.

The Ontario Public Service Employees Union rejected the final offer from college management, after negotiations at the Delta Chelsea Hotel in downtown Toronto.

This strike comes just a month before many student's scheduled graduations. If courses are extended into the summer, to compensate for lost school time, students' ability to maintain jobs to pay for their education would be severely limited.

“A prolonged strike would not only affect college students, but also have a ripple affect on the Ontario economy and workforce. Potential employers are expecting 44,000 new graduates and 100,000 returning students to enter the workforce this May, families have made summer plans, and some seasonal businesses may experience a significant loss if the school year does not finish on time,” says Tyler Charlebois, Director of Advocacy for the College Student Alliance. “I hope for the sake of Ontario, the provincial government takes this situation as seriously as we are and takes action as necessary.”

OPSEU was asking for more teachers, smaller classes, and more faculty time for students. A strike vote was 80.4% in favour of action. Humber had the least support for the strike, with only 67.0%, followed by St. Lawrence with 67.7%. St. Clair, Boréal, Centennial, and Sault all had more than 90% support.

The &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20New%20Piper%20Aircraft"&gt;Piper&lt;/a&gt; model &lt;a href="w%3APiper%20Cherokee"&gt;PA-28-180&lt;/a&gt; aircraft crashed in the median during mid-afternoon local time, and slowed traffic when police and rescue teams were en route to the scene. According to local television station &lt;a href="w%3AWEYI-TV"&gt;WEYI-TV&lt;/a&gt;, two passengers were aboard the plane, and did not sustain any large injuries.

According to the FAA database, the plane was manufactured in 1968, and was issued a license in 1970. The most recent owner according to the database is a flying school in &lt;a href="w%3AColdwater%2C%20Ohio"&gt;Coldwater&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Ohio"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt;.

At least 250 members of &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;'s emergency services personnel in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; have been informed that they could die from exposure to fatal levels of &lt;a href="w%3AAsbestos"&gt;asbestos&lt;/a&gt; following emergency response training south of &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;.

Members of the Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) unit are thought to be at risk. They were told last week they may contract life-threatening illnesses following training on a demolition site at Holsworthy Army Barracks. The site was created to simulate rescues in the event of a terror attack or natural disaster. It has been regularly used by emergency services personnel since 2004.

Some of the emergency services personnel spent up to three weeks at a time crawling through the rubble.

Reports claim that when notified last week, senior personnel were left devastated. It can take decades for asbestos related illnesses to appear and can take up to 30 years before those exposed can be cleared of infection.

In addition to the emergency service personnel, doctors, nurses and hazardous material personnel could also be at a mild risk. Even &lt;a href="w%3AMorris%20Iemma"&gt;Morris Iemma&lt;/a&gt;, premier of New South Wales, who visited the site has been warned he could be at risk.

According to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Daily%20Telegraph%20%28Australia%29"&gt;The Daily Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, a repected Sydney newspaper, it has been established that "No proper tests were done at the site before it became a training ground for hundreds of top-level rescuers in 2004",
"Personnel were kept in the dark for up to a year about the asbestos before being told last week",
"NSW public officials and a host of ministers may have been exposed",
"Ambulance chief Greg Rochford and Mr Mullins have been at the site and must face a health clearance", and
"The Dust Diseases Tribunal is conducting an investigation into the long-term impact the mass exposure could have on emergency services in NSW."

The judge in the &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; federal death penalty trial against &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AZacarias%20Moussaoui"&gt;Zacarias Moussaoui&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ruled on Friday that prosecutors can seek replacement witnesses for seven &lt;a href="Federal%20Aviation%20Administration"&gt;Federal Aviation Administration&lt;/a&gt; (FAA) employees whose testimony was tainted, and therefore disallowed because of pre-trial coaching by a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATransportation%20Security%20Administration"&gt;Transportation Security Administration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (TSA) lawyer.

The 18-member jury (6 alternates) were sent home for a week while the court dealt with the revelation that government aviation security witness had been contacted prior to the trial by TSA lawyer &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACarla%20Martin"&gt;Carla J. Martin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , to help prepare their testimony in the case.

Martin, aged 51, is accused of misconduct by sending prosecution witnesses e-mail that included trial transcripts of another related case along with observations of her own that pertained to the Moussaoui case, including suggestions and talking points. She was recently suspended with pay by the TSA and retained Roscoe Howard to act as legal council in the face of legal actions that might arise against her. 

Judge &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALeonie%20Brinkema"&gt;Leonie M. Brinkema&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; initially ruled to prevent testimony from any aviation employees, but reversed her decision after the prosecution argued they would have little case left if their testimony remained inadmissible. FAA employee testimony is expected to take the form of what measures would have been taken by the agency to prevent against the &lt;a href="September%2011%2C%202001%20attacks"&gt;September 11, 2001&lt;/a&gt; airliner attacks in &lt;a href="New%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Washington%20D.C."&gt;Washington D.C.&lt;/a&gt; if Moussaoui had warned officials of the plan prior to the strikes. 

The connection to the Carla Martin involvement in the case was discovered in a separate trial involving liability law suits against two U.S. airline companies for losses as a result of the attacks. Family member lawyers of flight attendants drew attention to contacts by Martin to persons involved in the case. 

The jury will return Monday for the trial's resumption.

A U.S. federal public defender appointed to Moussaoui argued for the jury to spare his life during opening statements on Monday, March 6, in the trial that will determine his fate &amp;mdash; either life in prison or death by lethal injection.
Defense attorney Edward B. MacMahon said that Moussaoui "aspires to martyrdom," and called on jurors to deny the &lt;a href="Al-Qaeda"&gt;Al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; operative his wish to die. A wish that would result in him becoming "a smiling face on a recruiting poster for &lt;a href="Osama%20bin%20Laden"&gt;Osama bin Laden&lt;/a&gt;," MacMahon said.

Moussaoui is believed by some to be the missing member in the team of 19 other attackers that carried out the suicide airliner strikes in New York City and Washington D.C. Arrested in &lt;a href="Minnesota"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; on immigration charges three weeks prior to the attacks, Moussaoui could have warned officials of the pending attacks, but failed to do so, argued Assistant U.S. Attorney Rob Spencer for the prosecution in opening statements.

The second day of the trial both Moussaoui and juror's attention was riveted as a federal prosecutor read a radio transmission account of the exchange between a flight attendant on Flight 11 and ground controllers.

"We are flying low. We are flying very very low. We are flying way too low," Amy Sweeney told controllers, according to an Associated Press report. The plane crashed into the north tower of the World Trade Center at 8:44 a.m. after she said, "Oh my God, we are way too low!"

Moussaoui has claimed that he had no involvement with the 9/11 attacks when he pleaded guilty to:
<ol>
BULLET::::1. conspiracy to commit acts of terrorism transcending national boundaries
BULLET::::2. conspiracy to commit aircraft piracy
BULLET::::3. conspiracy to destroy aircraft
BULLET::::4. conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction
BULLET::::5. conspiracy to murder United States employees
BULLET::::6. conspiracy to destroy property
</ol>
He said that he was to play a role in another future attack on the White House using an aircraft. Four of the conspiracy charges each carry a maximum penalty of death.

Family members of the nearly 3,000 killed in the attacks were able to watch the &lt;a href="Alexandria%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Alexandria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Virginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; courtroom proceedings by closed-circuit television in six U.S. cities: New York, &lt;a href="Boston"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt;, Central Islip, &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;N.Y.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANewark%2C%20New%20Jersey"&gt;Newark&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="New%20Jersey"&gt;N.J.&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Philadelphia"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;.

Moussaoui has a history of disrupting previous trial proceedings with outbursts. He has disavowed his lawyers, and mostly ignored his mother who was present during the opening days of the trial because she had spoken to his defense lawyers.
Upon leaving the Tuesday, March 7 court session for a recess, Moussaoui pumped his right fist in the air and shouted, "Allah Akbar! God curse America! Bless Osama bin Laden!"

The outbursts have been timed to occur outside the earshot of Judge Brinkema and the jury as those persons filed out of the courtroom for recesses.
Moussaoui pleaded guilty in April last year to the conspiracy charges. Evidence linking him to the plot was discovered when his duffel bags were searched after the attacks.

Jerry Zuchlinski, a natural resources professor at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASault%20College"&gt;Sault College&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , is taking the side of the administration during the 2006 &lt;a href="Ontario"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; college teachers' strike.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASault%20Ste.%20Marie%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Sault Ste. Marie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Ontario professor disagrees with OPSEU's suggestions that staff is overworked and underpaid, while joining his colleagues on the picket lines. He told newspaper ♡❤Soo Today♡❤, "I don't feel that the faculty concern with being overworked is valid. I do the same job that they do."
While the rest of the faculty carried signs stating, "Faculty care about quality education," Professor Zuchlinski's read, "FACULTY LAZY GREEDY + STUPID."

The position is especially bold, as 92.2% of Sault's faculty support the strike, the fourth highest percentage overall. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASt%20Clair%20College"&gt;St Clair&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; voted overwhelmingly in favour, with 96.6%, while &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALoyalist%20College"&gt;Loyalist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was least supportive of the action, with 64.0%.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20Public%20Service%20Employees%20Union"&gt;Ontario Public Service Employees Union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; denied the final deal offered by the College Compensation and Appointments Council on Monday night. Faculty have been without contracts since 31 August 2005.

Zuchlinski said the faculty were offered a deal that would pay many as much as $95,000 per year, which, according to Sault College Campus News represents a 12.6% increase over four years.

The strike comes just a month before the end of the school year, which means courses may be extended into the spring and summer, making it difficult for students to find jobs to pay tuition.

Gordon Roger Alexander Buchannan Parks was born November 30, 1912, in &lt;a href="w%3AFort%20Scott%2C%20Kansas"&gt;Fort Scott&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Kansas"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt;, the youngest of 15 children. After his mother's death when he was 16, he moved to &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Paul%2C%20Minnesota"&gt;St. Paul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Minnesota"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;, where he attended high school. He dropped out in order to find work during increasingly hard times, traveling extensively in the North and Northwest looking for jobs. 

In 1938, he bought his first camera and experimented with both &lt;a href="w%3ADocumentary%20photography"&gt;documentary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Afashion%20photography"&gt;fashion photography&lt;/a&gt;. At age 30, he won a fellowship and traveled to &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;, where he worked as a photographer for the &lt;a href="w%3AFarm%20Security%20Administration"&gt;Farm Security Administration&lt;/a&gt; and later for the &lt;a href="w%3AOffice%20of%20War%20Information"&gt;Office of War Information&lt;/a&gt;.

During his time at the FSA, Parks composed photo-essays critical of the racial and social prejudices many faced. His work drew attention both to himself and to the poverty and social injustices of the time.

After the beginning of the war, Parks moved to Harlem, where he found a job as a fashion photographer for ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AVogue"&gt;Vogue&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and continued to take socially provocative photos of slum life in the city. It was these photos that convinced ♡❤Life♡❤♡s photography editor to hire him.

In 1962, Parks wrote ♡❤The Learning Tree♡❤, based on his Kansas childhood. The book was a success, and Parks later directed the film version, for which he also wrote the screenplay and the music. ♡❤The Learning Tree♡❤ was one of the first 25 films placed on the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Film%20Registry"&gt;National Film Registry&lt;/a&gt;. Parks next directed ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AShaft%20%281971%20film%29"&gt;Shaft&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and its successful sequel, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AShaft%27s%20Big%20Score"&gt;Shaft's Big Score&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, as well as a &lt;a href="w%3Ablaxploitation"&gt;blaxploitation&lt;/a&gt; comedy called ♡❤Supercops♡❤.

Parks' other artistic achievements include a ballet, written about &lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20Luther%20King%2C%20Jr."&gt;Martin Luther King, Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, four other memoirs, a collection of poetry, several original musical compositions and at least one other fictional, non-autobiographical novel. Collections and exhibits of his photography have traveled extensively within and beyond the United States.

He is survived by his three ex-wives, Sally Alvis, Elizabeth Campbell, and Ms. Young; his daughter, Toni Parks Parson, and his son, David, from his first marriage; and a daughter, Leslie Parks Harding, from his second marriage; five grandchildren; and five great grandchildren. A son, Gordon Parks Jr., died in 1979.

Due to the province-wide college strike, events at &lt;a href="w%3AHumber%20College"&gt;Humber College&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AEtobicoke%2C%20Ontario%2C%20Canada"&gt;Etobicoke, Ontario, Canada&lt;/a&gt; have been cancelled or delayed.

Latin Jazz Night, set to happen on Wednesday evening at 8:00 pm is cancelled, as is an Evening of Sketch Comedy, which was scheduled for Sunday, March 12 at 8:00 pm.

The Evening of Sketch Comedy is organized by students of the Humber School of Comedy. Humber is the only institution to offer comedy courses at a post-secondary or post-graduate level. The Evening is a part of students' marks.

Theatre Humber's production of ♡❤The Rover♡❤ has survived the axe. Set to play from Friday, March 31 – Saturday, April 8 at the Humber Theatre, it has been pre-emptively postponed.

Faculty of 24 colleges across the province went on strike as of Monday night, after no deal was made in continued collective bargaining.

The &lt;a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; voted Tuesday to reauthorize with small revisions several amendments to the &lt;a href="w%3APatriot%20Act"&gt;USA Patriot Act&lt;/a&gt;, clearing the way for the Patriot Act to be re-signed into law by &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush.&lt;/a&gt;

The bill, which passed the House with a vote of 280-138, will be sent to President Bush this week. Major provisions of the Patriot Act were approved earlier this year by both the House and the &lt;a href="United%20States%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt;. This bill offered slight revisions to past amendments to the overall act. The act itself was set to expire on March 16.

Representative &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Sensenbrenner"&gt;F. James Sensenbrenner&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Reublican%20Party"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href="Wisconsin"&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;), chairman of the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20House%20Committed%20on%20the%20Judiciary"&gt;House Judiciary Committee&lt;/a&gt;, introduced the Senate bill into the house for consideration and urged his colleagues to vote for its passage under a special suspension of the rules.

Sensenbrenner highlighted three revisions in arguing for the bill's passage. One change established a person's right to challenge legally any orders given to him or her under the &lt;a href="w%3AForeign%20Intelligence%20Surveillance%20Act"&gt;Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act&lt;/a&gt;. The bill also included multiple provisions allowing that anyone who is ordered by the &lt;a href="FBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; under a number of acts to produce evidence or testimony does not have to reveal the name of anyone from whom he or she sought legal advice. The amendment also contains a section that amends the original act to specify that libraries are not considered wire or electronic communication service providers.

The Senate passed the same measure last week by a vote of 89-10.

In &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; police have released photographs of up to 20 men who are of interest in connection with the race riots in the &lt;a href="Sydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; suburb of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACronulla%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Cronulla&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in December, 2005.

Strike Force Enoggera detectives have been vigourously investigating the riots over the past few months. Police have reportedly shown photographs at schools, pubs and clubs in an attempt to identify those who they are looking for.

Detective Superintendent Ken McKay told the media on February 23, 2006 that they wanted "people who were involved in assaults, throwing missiles and damaging vehicles at Cronulla on December 11 to come forward and hand themselves into police". He warned them that they would have around 10 days before the photos would be released publicly.

According to a statement on NSW Police's website, police have exhausted all other investigative angles and have released the photos "of excellent quality and predominantly from news organisations" in an attempt to gain information from the general public.

In addition to the photographs, police will release a video showing "a large number of Middle Eastern males and vehicles that police wish to identify in relation to their behaviour on the night of December 12." according to NSW Police. The videos have been supplied to police by witnesses. One was filmed at a service station in Cronulla and the other was filmed on the corner of The Kingsway in Cronulla. The vehicle was a hatchback with a rear P-plate.

Of late, two further arrests have been made in relation to the Cronulla riots. A 27-year-old man handed himself into police at Penrith, yesterday and was subsequently charged with two counts of riot and affray.

On February 27, 2006, police arrested a 23-year-old man at his home in Cronulla. He was charged with hinder police and police allege that he tried to prevent police from arresting another man during the Cronulla riots.

So far, 66 people have been arrested in connection with the riots. Police say "anyone who can assist the strikeforce in identifying these people or if they have any other information in regards to riots and revenge attacks at Cronulla, Maroubra and Brighton is urged to contact Crimestoppers on 1800 333 000..."

Eighteen men, ranging in ages from young to elderly, whose bodies were found bound and blindfolded in a minibus in &lt;a href="Baghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;, were hanged. "The medical report shows that all of them were hanged," a source at Baghdad's Yarmuk hospital said. "We found a rope round the neck of one of the victims."

A security patrol discovered the minibus just before midnight on the road between the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAmiriyah"&gt;Amiriyah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and Khadra districts. The victims, all men, had been handcuffed, blindfolded and either hanged or shot to death, police Lt. Maitham Abdul-Razzaq said.

Police say they have no clues to the victims' identities. The bodies were found near the Amriya district of western Baghdad &amp;mdash; one of the city's most dangerous sections, Abdul-Razzaq said.

Official figures suggest an increase in such killings since the destruction of a major &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AShiite"&gt;Shiite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; shrine in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASamarra"&gt;Samarra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; two weeks ago sparked reprisal attacks. Local people have accused the Shiite-led, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;-backed government's police and other security forces of abducting and killing Sunni civilians.

The dumping of bodies bearing signs of torture and killed execution-style has become a feature of &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;'s violence between armed factions. 

Meanwhile, the U.S. ambassador to Iraq &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AZalmay%20Khalilzad"&gt;Zalmay Khalilzad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; warned that the country is vulnerable to rebels’ attempts to exploit the political situation caused by the shrine attack. "There is a concerted effort to provoke civil war," he said.

Iraq's parliament is expected to sit on Sunday for the first time since the December elections.

The &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo"&gt;Congo's&lt;/a&gt; population of &lt;a href="w%3ABonobo"&gt;Bonobo&lt;/a&gt;, or Pygmy, Chimpanzee (♡❤Pan paniscus♡❤) is dwindling, according to researchers.

Dr. Ino Guabini, a primatologist with the World Wildlife Fund reports that only about 5,000 remain in Congo. In 1984, their numbers were estimated at 100,000.

It is illegal to hunt Bonobos, but their meat is considered tasty; and is a traditional food in the Congo. The meat is often sent to expensive &amp; secretive restaurants in Congolese cities.

The Bonobo is best-known for resolving squabbles through sex rather than violence. Rivals are greeted with genital handshakes and sensual body rubs. Fights are often settled with a "French kiss" and sex, either heterosexual or homosexual. Bonobo's communication is primarily vocal.

DNA evidence suggests that the Bonobo and Common Chimpanzee separated just 500,000 years after they diverged from the last common ancestor with humans, between four to seven million years ago. Chimpanzees are the closest living relatives to humans, and are an important research model in both biology and psychology.

On Wednesday March 8, &lt;a href="North%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt; launched two &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Asurface-to-air%20missile"&gt;surface-to-air missiles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , during military training exercises near the border with &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, according to ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKyodo%20News"&gt;Kyodo News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ which cited two military sources.

The sources, however, dispute where those missiles were launched. An "Asian security source" stated that the missiles may have been launched in the direction of China by mistake, and landed just inside the North Korean border. A "Western military source", however, claimed that they were launched to the east, in the direction of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASea%20of%20Japan"&gt;Sea of Japan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , but still says they landed in North Korean territory.

North Korea surprised the world when it launched a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aballistic%20missile"&gt;ballistic missile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; over northern &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; in 1998. Since then, it has conducted many missile tests, including a dense battery of land-to-ship missile tests in 2003 when tensions rose over its possible possession of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Anuclear%20weapon"&gt;nuclear weapons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . It is believed to be developing a ballistic missile that could reach &lt;a href="Alaska"&gt;Alaska&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Hawaii"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;, or even the continental &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="Toronto"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt;'s public utility, Toronto Hydro Telecom, will make &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;'s largest city into a huge &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHotspot%20%28wifi%29"&gt;wireless hotspot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

"This is both an exciting and very important initiative for the city of Toronto", said Toronto's mayor, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Miller"&gt;David Miller&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . "It puts us on the leading edge of the telecommunications industry nationwide and globally."

Toronto Hydro Telecom will offer customers free access for the first six months. After that, it will begin to charge for services.

"Wi-Fi technology is the new benchmark for urban living", stated Toronto Hydro president David Dobbin. "It's standard equipment in many electronic devices, from laptops to portable entertainment units."

Private telephone companies are questioning why a public utility needs to compete with the private sector.

Mike Lee of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARogers%20Communications"&gt;Rogers Communications Inc.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; questioned why the city of Toronto wanted to enter the internet access business.

"It will not be an easy business", Lee told the ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Post"&gt;National Post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤. "In this day and age, the focus should be on core operations more than anything. I was surprised to see they are looking to get into this business."

Brian Sharwood, a telecom analyst in Toronto, said the municipality will likely install the wireless transmitters and receivers on its lamp posts as a way to blanket the city, a process known as "&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Awireless%20mesh%20networking"&gt;wireless mesh networking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ".

As reported on ♡❤Wikinews♡❤, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AisoHunt"&gt;isoHunt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABittorrent"&gt;torrent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20Relay%20Chat"&gt;IRC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; search site frequented by a massive number of &lt;a href="Internet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt; users everyday, has recently been one of the targets of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMotion%20Picture%20Association%20of%20America"&gt;Motion Picture Association of America&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's anti-piracy campaign. Originally starting out as an IRC indexing site in January of 2003, isoHunt added torrent search later that year in July and has been steadily growing since. By December, isoHunt had 16,248 torrents available. Today that amount is around 250,000.

isoHunt has survived while many similar sites around it crumbled, yet was operating long before the others had even been thought of. In April of 2005, isoHunt also gained Torrentbox after its administrator gave it to Gary Fung of isoHunt.

♡❤Wikinews♡❤ interviewed Mr. Fung, the 22 year-old &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; administrator of the sites.

♡❤Why did you start your site?♡❤&lt;BR&gt;
For fun, and to learn web programming (PHP and Mysql). Also a web search engine for P2P networks has not been done, and would be useful.

♡❤I read on your site at the time, news of the MPAA's actions hit the news, that you had not been notified, how did you find out? How did you react?♡❤&lt;BR&gt;
I found out first from Mike at Slyck.com, who have received letters of the press release, along with other news outlets like CNET. Within a few hours, all the news sites posted about it.

♡❤Do you feel it is appropriate for the MPAA to publicly announce that they have commenced action against your sites and others before you even receive notification?♡❤&lt;BR&gt;
Yes, although not surprising. Factually speaking, industry associations like the MPAA often use the threat of pending lawsuits to intimidate to-be defendants, and it serves their purpose of spreading FUD to the public at large.

♡❤Have you ever received a takedown notice from any company in accordance with the DMCA?♡❤&lt;BR&gt;
At least once a day, often many times a day. I've lost count of how many takedown requests we've received now, it would be at least in the hundreds, if not a thousand. We have a thorough copyright policy outlining our stance, compliance and procedures: http://isohunt.com/dmca-copyright.php. Some of them come back and actually thank us with satisfaction for our prompt processing. For others, such as indie content producers for TV shows and movies, we actually talk to them about using BitTorrent to aid their distribution. And such partnerships are in the works.

♡❤How do you go about dealing with them?♡❤&lt;BR&gt;
We verify their authenticity, whether identified works are within their copyright, and disable them if found to be aiding in possible copyright infringement.

♡❤Do you think the service you provide is any different to that of major search engines such as Google and Yahoo?♡❤&lt;BR&gt;
No. We are all search engines, only designed for different markets. "Torrents" for example are metadata pointers that describe and link to resources on BitTorrent swarms. Google and isoHunt for example are different only in forms of links and types of data they index. Both serve the purpose of organizing information on open networks on the internet (WWW and P2P), making them useful and searchable.

According to the isoHunt website, Gary received official notification of the MPAA's lawsuit on February 28, 2006. Gary admits that he was impressed by the amount of research which was put into the suit. He said: "I have to say I am impressed by the depth of their legal research, evidently their lawyers have been watching us for at least a year, since we exchanged letters last year. However, their core accusation is false. We do NOT operate this search engine and other P2P services for the express object of infringing MPAA's copyrights, there are many other torrents of content we index that are not owned by the MPAA, copyrighted or non-copyrighted. We would comply with DMCA takedown requests, given sufficient identification. Which they did not."

&lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Chicago"&gt;University of Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Illinois"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt; biologists Dr. Benjamin Voight, Dr. Sridhar Kudaravalli, Dr. Xiaoquan Wen and Dr. Jonathan Pritchard have identified regions of human &lt;a href="w%3ADNA"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt; showing the strongest marks of natural selection within the last 5,000 to 15,000 years.

They found that many recent genetic changes are related to the development of agriculture. In particular, the genes for digestion of milk into adulthood occurred only after some level of domestication of animals. Most mammals drink milk only in infancy.

The work may shed light on the genetic factors involved in various human medical conditions, including high blood pressure and alcoholism.

The Chicago finding also contradicts the tacit assumption of much social science that human evolution "ground to a halt" in the distant past. Even evolutionary psychologists have tempered their claims based upon this assumption.

The study is based upon DNA changes found in three populations examined by the HapMap project: &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;ns, East Asians and &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;ans.

The study has been published in PLOS-Biology.

Bars and nightclubs in London, Manchester, and Newcastle, UK, now carry vending machines selling sex toys for about £5. These fuchsia-pink Tabooboo machines are usually located near toilets to render deliberating customers a modicum of privacy. However, some hairdressing salons are giving the machines "center stage". Products available from these unconventional vending machines include mini vibrators, "silicone ticklers", "lust fingers", and bottles of "love liquid" (an edible lubricant).

The Alphabet Bar in London's West End, host to the first sex toy vending machine in the U.K., claims many people visit especially for the machine, and describes it as a "great success". Alan Lucas, the managing director of the company behind this enterprise, Tabooboo, suggests that the success of the machines is due to younger people having a more liberal view of sex toys. He stated, "The most popular product is a vibrating rod ring which is something [the man] wears [on his penis]".

The machines are expected to begin appearing in the U.S. and Italy.

The magazine ♡❤&lt;a href="http%3A//www.secularhumanism.org/index.php%3Fsection%3Dfi%26amp%3Bpage%3Dindex"&gt;Free Inquiry&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, issued in &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt; and published by the Center for Inquiry, is to publish some of the Islam's Prophet Muhammad cartoons. These cartoons were originally published in the Danish newspaper ♡❤Jyllands-Posten♡❤, causing waves of violence and protests among Muslims worldwide.

Tom Flynn, editor of the secular magazine, said that he was only acting alongside several European papers that reprinted the cartoons "demonstrating a commitment to free expression and a free press." He commented further that "no religious teaching, community, or institution should be held immune from criticism simply because of its religious nature."

Three articles will be published alongside the cartoons. In the first, Flynn will trace the controversy and explain the magazine's decision to publish them. A second, by R. Joseph Hoffmann, director of the Council for Secular Humanism's Committee for the Scientific Examination of Religion, will present further commentary; the last will be on the history of the Prophet Muhammad.

Four of the original twelve cartoons are to be published: the image of Muhammad wearing a bomb with its fuse lit as a turban, another claimed to show horns coming out of the Prophet's turban, Muhammad [or an Imam] greeting suicide bombers in heaven, and one showing a male face on a Muslim with Islam's star and crescent. Flynn said this last cartoon "is included as an example of how the collection's less sharply focused entries fell flat."

Arif Desai, Imam of the Islamic Society of Niagara Frontier in &lt;a href="w%3AAmherst%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Amherst, New York&lt;/a&gt;, said that the Muslim community felt sorrow over the magazine's decision to publish the cartoons.

"We feel sorrow, we feel hurt and insulted as these are very disturbing, insulting cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad. Obviously, we know and believe in freedom of speech, but along with freedom of speech comes responsibility," said Desai.

The cartoons will be published next week on March 15, 2006.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
The Common Council of Buffalo voted on Tuesday to send the Elmwood Village Hotel proposal "to committee for further discussion", after citing the need for more public involvement.

The ♡❤Elmwood Village Hotel♡❤ is a development proposal by the Savarino Construction Services Corporation, a project designed by the architect Karl Frizlen of The Frizlen Group. The hotel would be placed on the southeast corner of Elmwood and Forest Avenues in Buffalo. 

To make way for the project, at least five buildings located at 1109 to 1121 Elmwood Ave would be demolished. At least two properties on Forest Avenue could also be demolished. The Elmwood properties, according to Eva Hassett, Vice President of Savarion Construction, are "under contract", but it is unclear if Savarino Construction actually owns the Elmwood properties. Hans Mobius, a former mayorial candidate, is still believed to be the current owner the properties. Mobius also owns 607 Forest Avenue.

<h3>Other properties could be effected</h3>
The properties 605 and 607 Forest Avenue could also be included in the proposal according to Hassett.

"We would use a Special Development Plan to rezone 1119-1121 Elmwood and 605 Forest to a C-2 zoning category," stated Hassett. It is possible that Savarino Construction may try to obtain a variance for 605 Forest, which would allow them to enforce &lt;a href="w%3Aeminent%20domain"&gt;eminent domain&lt;/a&gt;, should the hotel be allowed to go forward.

The building at 607 Forest was also discussed to be rezoned, but it is unclear what the plans would be for that property. During the February 28 Common Council meeting, Hassett stated that the properties 605 and 607 were "now off the agenda".

Pano Georgiadis, owner of Pano's Restaurant at 1081 Elmwood, owns the property at 605 Forest and attended Tuesday's Common Council meeting.

"Having a hotel is a bright idea. We all love the idea of a hotel, but the way that it is presented, is wishful thinking. This hotel does not fit. It's like putting two gallons of water in a gallon jug, it does not fit. At the last meeting, the architect admitted that they are planning to put the undergound parking lot and the hotel, right at the property line. If I open my window, I will be able to touch the wall, that goes fifty feet high", said Georgiadis. 

"There is a problem having a seventy-two room hotel and fifty-five parking spaces. That means that all the other cars will spill all over the neighborhood. The footprint is simply too small. If you have a bigger [parking] lot, and a smaller hotel, I will welcome a hotel. I have a parking lot at my own business, and I am chasing people all day long. Remember, the city says it has 'zero tolerance [for illegal parking]'. Try telling that to the guy from &lt;a href="w%3AAlbany%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Albany&lt;/a&gt; who came to see his kids, that are going to &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%20State%20College"&gt;Buffalo State&lt;/a&gt;, who would get tickets totaling over a hundred dollars", added Georgiadis.

The city's Planning Board is scheduled to meet on March 14, 2006 at 9:00 a.m. about the proposal. Although a discussion will take place, no vote is expected to be taken.

At the moment, none of the properties are zoned for a hotel. Savarino Construction plans on asking for a C2 zoning permit. If that does not work, they plan to implement a new zoning plan called a "special development plan" which would allow for only a hotel on the site. That zone would not be able to be changed.

<h3>Mobius accused of being a slumlord by local residents</h3>
"This [project] justifies Mobius's refusal to invest in any maitenance or improvements", on the properties said Clarence Carnahan, a local resident. "Where were the Council persons over the years? Where were the city inspectors over the years, to make sure that he maintained and improved his properties? The government was supposed to be protecting, not being preditorial. I see a predatorial issue here when it comes to this hotel. Over the years: Why has the local government been disfunctional when it came to Mobius's properties? Refusal to invest in improvements, doesn't that sound like a slumlord? Maybe I am missing a point here, but what kind of messages does this send to other slumlords that havn't been jailed or fined? It's [the hotel] trying to be pushed through."

Carnahan also presented signs for residents and or business owners who are opposed to the hotel, that could be placed in windows or on stakes in the yard. Some of the signs said, 'No tell hotel', 'Hans off, no hotel', 'It takes more than a hotel to make a village'. and 'Keep Elmwood free, no hotel'. Carnahan plans on making more signs for a protest to be held on Saturday March 18, at 2:00 p.m. (EST) on Elmwood and Forest. Some signs were given to individuals after the meeting.

"First things first, Hans is the problem, and I don't think it has been addressed. Let's roll back the clock on this project. What can we do with Hans? There is such thing as eminent domain, which could be of greater interest to the community, to seize the property at its lowest assessed value", said Nancy Pollina, co-owner of Don Apparel with Patty Morris at 1119 Elmwood. "There are so many ideas that have not been explored and we are about to give this parcel away, to a big developer."

Mobius has not returned any calls by ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ regarding the situation.

<h3>Mobius may be giving up</h3>

A freelance journalist writing for ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ has obtained a &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikinews.org/wiki/Image%3AHansLetter.jpg"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt;, exclusively, addressed to one of the five business owners from Hans Mobius stating:

♡❤There is a proposal to develop my property which you are currently renting. Because of opposition to this development, it does not look like it will happen. I will let you know if there any changes.♡❤

Despite the letter, there have been no plans or decisions made to end the proposal. 

To date, none of the business owners or residents of 1119-1121 Elmwood have received an eviction notice.

<h3>Business owners and residents not against 'facelift'</h3>
Business owners and residents gave an indication of what they would like to see happen at the corner; a project similar to one done locally last year. There, developers renovated two buildings on Auburn and Elmwood Avenues, merging the buildings into one thus allowing for more shop space. Among some of the shops to move in after the development were Cone Five Pottery, The Ruby Slipper, and Abraham's Jewelers. Prior to the renovation work, the left building in the picture was boarded up for several years. Many of the concerned locals would like to see a similar development on Forest and Elmwood.

Rocco Termini, a developer in Buffalo, proposed a &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikinews.org/wiki/Image%3ARocco38vc.jpg"&gt;similar design&lt;/a&gt; at the February 28 community meeting 

In an interview after the February 28 meeting, Termini stated, "I will be willing to take a look at this myself, or I would be more than happy to be partners with Sam, Sam Savarino", who is President and Chief Executive Officer of Savarino Construction Services Corp.

So far Savarino Construction has no plans to team up with Termini.

<h1>NFL owners agree to CBA extension, 30-2</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=NFL%20owners%20agree%20to%20CBA%20extension%2C%2030-2&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The owners of the teams of the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Football%20League"&gt;National Football League&lt;/a&gt; agreed Wednesday night at 7:35 p.m. EDT--25 minutes before a final deadline of 8:00 p.m. EDT--to a &lt;a href="w%3Acollective%20bargaining"&gt;collective bargaining agreement&lt;/a&gt; extension proposal put together by the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Football%20League%20Players%27%20Association"&gt;NFL Players Association&lt;/a&gt;. The final vote was 30-2, with &lt;a href="w%3ARalph%20C.%20Wilson%20Jr."&gt;Ralph Wilson&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%20Bills"&gt;Buffalo Bills&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Brown%20%28football%20team%20owner%29"&gt;Mike Brown&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3ACincinnati%20Bengals"&gt;Cincinnati Bengals&lt;/a&gt; voting no.

Faced with a severely limiting salary cap of &lt;a href="w%3AUS%24"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;94.5 million in 2006 and the total loss of the &lt;a href="w%3Asalary%20cap"&gt;salary cap&lt;/a&gt; in 2007, potentially ending the era of &lt;a href="w%3Aparity"&gt;parity&lt;/a&gt; in the NFL, the owners' final caveat was not with the NFLPA, but with themselves. They were arguing over the continuation of &lt;a href="w%3Arevenue%20sharing"&gt;revenue sharing&lt;/a&gt;, and how it should proceed through the CBA extension. In the end, owners agreed to a three-tiered revenue sharing system: The top five revenue teams would each pay the highest share into the revenue sharing pool, teams 6-10 would each pay the middle share, and teams 11-15 would each pay the lowest share. The lower 17 teams would then split the revenue sharing pool.

The CBA extension permits the salary cap to rise to $102 million for the 2006 season, and $109 million for 2007. It also extends the maximum proration period for &lt;a href="w%3Asigning%20bonus"&gt;signing bonuses&lt;/a&gt; to five years in 2006, then six years in 2007, before returning to five years in 2008.

The owners and the NFLPA have been working on a CBA extension for nearly two years. If the deadline had passed Wednesday night, then the current CBA would have ended after the 2007 season, with the owners fearing a strike and a possible challenge from another professional football league, like the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Football%20League"&gt;USFL&lt;/a&gt; in the mid-1980s. This fear is substantiated by the 2004-05 strike in the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Hockey%20League"&gt;NHL&lt;/a&gt;, during which an unsuccessful challenge was made by a re-formed &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Hockey%20Association%20%28proposed%29"&gt;World Hockey Association&lt;/a&gt;.

The man who took at least 22 people hostage in Colbert de Torcy High School near &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALe%20Mans"&gt;Le Mans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, most of whom were teenagers, surrendered without incident.

Reports indicated 20 of the hostages were students, and two others were adults, possibly school employees. This was higher than initial reports of 18 students and two adults. According to a school receptionist, Bernadette Mercier, the students ranged in age from 17 to 18 years old. The school holds up to 1,500 students. No one was harmed in the incident.

The situation began when the man, aged 33, walked into Colbert de Torcy High School at 1:00 PM GMT, Thursday afternoon and officials say he was suffering from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Adepression%20%28mood%29"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . "We knew him, so we simply let him in," Mercier said. "He seemed totally normal."

The hostage-taker was reported to be armed with a gun, which later turned out to be fake.

The man had lost his job as a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Asubstitute%20teacher"&gt;substitute teacher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at the school two years ago. He was quoted as saying he "wants to talk to the press about his employment problems." He's also asked to speak with &lt;a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Fillon"&gt;François Fillon&lt;/a&gt;, the local mayor and former French education minister. Mr. Fillon was the author of an education reform program.

Students were allowed to use their &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Amobile%20phone"&gt;mobile phones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to communicate with their families according to Jean Luc Prigent, head of security for the Le Mans region which includes the school. A special hotline was set up, along with a crisis center for parents of the students.

A hostage rescue team called the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGIGN"&gt;GIGN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , was dispatched to the scene, coming by helicopter from Villacoublay Military Airport just west of &lt;a href="Paris%2C%20France"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInterior%20Minister"&gt;Interior Minister&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="Nicolas%20Sarkozy"&gt;Nicolas Sarkozy&lt;/a&gt; said he was paying close attention to the situation.

The school is located in northwestern France in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASabl%C3%A9-sur-Sarthe"&gt;Sablé-sur-Sarthe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; near the city of Le Mans.

A small explosive device detonated this afternoon at a police guard post near to the residence of former Prime Minister General &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APrem%20Tinsulanonda"&gt;Prem Tinsulanonda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;a href="Bangkok"&gt;Bangkok&lt;/a&gt;. The device injured two tourists, one &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; and one &lt;a href="UK"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt;.

Prem was &lt;a href="Thailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;'s PM from 1980, dismissing parliament and resigning the position in 1988. He went on to join the country's Privy Council and now chairs it.

The explosion comes against the backdrop of political tension in the country, with all main opposition parties boycotting the April 2nd election called by &lt;a href="Thaksin%20Shinawatra"&gt;Thaksin Shinawatra&lt;/a&gt;. Protests against the PM now occur daily, with a proposed boycott of goods and services from companies associated with the PM or his family being put into place.

Three men have been arrested and a further six "positively identified" following the public release of photographs showing "persons of interest" to police in relation to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2005%20Sydney%20race%20riots"&gt;Sydney riots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; last year.

A 20-year-old man from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWarilla%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Warilla&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a suburb of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWollongong%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Wollongong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , handed himself into police yesterday after seeing his photograph in a newspaper. He was subsequently charged with riot and affray.

An 18-year-old man from Bella Vista was arrested in a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABaulkham%20Hills%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Baulkham Hills&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; hotel yesterday afternoon after he was identified by the public. A 33-year-old Miranda man was also charged after handing himself into police last night. He will appear in Sutherland Local Court today.

Following the release of the photographs on March 8, police have received information from the public identifying seven of those wanted in relation to the riots.

&lt;a href="New%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; police minister &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACarl%20Scully"&gt;Carl Scully&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; yesterday urged the others to turn themselves into police before being arrested. "I'd say to those people, save yourselves the embarrassment and turn up to a police station", he said.

Police and the police minister have also criticised &lt;a href="Sydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="middle%20east"&gt;middle east&lt;/a&gt;ern community for failing to assist in identifying men wanted for revenge attacks after the riots.

"Generally speaking, when Caucasians are put on the front pages of newsletters, they're identified", said Mr Scully.

"And unfortunately, when footage is presented of people of Middle Eastern background, we get zip."

A spokesman from the Lebanese Friendship Association said that the middle eastern community was being persecuted.
"We are sick and tired of people saying why aren't we doing enough", said Keysar Trad.

"If the beat police can't recognise them, then the chances of anyone recognising them are very, very slim."

Other &lt;a href="Muslim"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; leaders urged parents to question their children and hand them into police if they suspect they took part in the revenge attacks which occurred after the riot. Lebanese Muslim Association spokesman Abdul El Ayoubi said parents should have questioned their children when the events first occurred.

"If (their children) were involved then they have a duty to take them in", he said.

"What they have done now, might be nothing to what they could do next time."

The NSW Islamic Council has also backed Mr Ayouvi's calls.

Detective Superintendent Ken McKay, the head of strike force Enoggera which is investigating the riots, said he was confident of making many more arrests over coming days thanks to the assistance of the public. "It wouldn't surprise me if we had, within the next day or two, the majority of them." he said yesterday.

"I'm confident (of arresting all 20). If I was a betting man I'd be running at close to odds-on."

United States army officers stated that the &lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Ghraib%20prison"&gt;Abu Ghraib prison&lt;/a&gt; will be closed within months, and its prisoners moved to other prisons and camps in Iraq. Some of the 4500 detainees will be sent to the new &lt;a href="w%3ACamp%20Cropper"&gt;Camp Cropper&lt;/a&gt;, which is built for this special purpose. The operation of Abu Ghraib will be transferred to the government of Iraq. Lieutenant Colonel Keir-Kevin Curry said: "No precise dates have been set, but the plan is to accomplish this within the next two to three months."

Lt. Col. Barry Johnson, military spokesman, says "Clearly there's a lot of emotion attached to Abu Ghraib. For Iraqis, it dates back a lot further than abuses committed by American soldiers, and it makes it a magnet for attacks."

The prison complex was a widely feared center for torture and execution under &lt;a href="w%3ASaddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt;, and as many as 4,000 people were executed in the prison in 1984. The buildings at Abu Ghraib were originally built by British contractors in the 1960s.
&lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Ghraib%20prisoner%20abuse%20reports/Gallery"&gt;Pictures&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Ghraib%20torture%20and%20prisoner%20abuse"&gt;extensive detainee abuse&lt;/a&gt; in Abu Ghraib taken inside the prison in November 2003 had been released earlier this year. In January 2005, a United States Army court martial proceeding found Army Spc. Charles Graner guilty of abusing prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison. The jury sentenced Graner to ten years in prison. A total of nine other American soldiers were found guilty in allegations stemming from the Abu Ghraib prison abuse scandal.

Japanese entrepreneur &lt;a href="w%3ADaisuke%20Enomoto"&gt;Daisuke "Dice-K" Enomoto&lt;/a&gt;, 34, is set to become the fourth private citizen in space. The &lt;a href="w%3AArlington%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Arlington, Virginia&lt;/a&gt;-based company "Space Adventures", which specializes in spaceflight-related travel, announced on March 7 that Enomoto was approved by the Russian space agency as a flight candidate.

Enomoto has now passed the physical examinations necessary to be cleared for training, finished the medical preparation, and signed the contract for the flight. His training with the Russian Federal Space Agency will include physical and aeronautical preparation as well as Russian language instruction.

Enomoto will be the first Japanese person to fly to the International Space Station (ISS). His trip, to take place in a &lt;a href="w%3ASoyuz"&gt;Soyuz&lt;/a&gt; TMA-9 rocket, is scheduled for September, with a ticket price of US$20 million.

United States entrepreneur &lt;a href="w%3AGregory%20Olsen"&gt;Gregory Olsen&lt;/a&gt; returned from the ISS in October 2005; previous space vacationers were American &lt;a href="w%3ADennis%20Tito"&gt;Dennis Tito&lt;/a&gt; in 2001 and South African &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Shuttleworth"&gt;Mark Shuttleworth&lt;/a&gt; in 2002.

On February 8, the same day &lt;a href="w%3ASuper%20Size%20Me"&gt;Super Size Me&lt;/a&gt; opened in Prague, a Czech film company's volunteer known as Karel Gustav Bozan began a 1 month diet of Czech pub food and beer in a Czech version called "Super Spek Me"; which translates loosely as "Super Flab Me".

Zuzana Pudilova of Aerofilms described the volunteer at that time: "He is a well-built man between 45 and 50. He is almost 2 metres tall, he is not exactly thin but until now he has had quite a healthy lifestyle." 

Karel ate typical Czech pub food for an entire month with three rules: no vegetables or fresh fruit (unless they came with a meal) no exercise, and lots of beer.

Karel's menu consisted entirely of typical Czech dishes. Obesity therapist, Iva Malkova, had warned at the beginning of the project: "People in the Czech Republic eat much more fat, especially animal fat than is recommended." Pub meals in the Czech Republic often consist of such fatty items as goose with dumplings or sausages.

Yesterday the results were announced; Karel lost six kilos, his cholesterol went down and so did his liver enzymes, triglyceride and uric acid levels. His blood pressure did not change. At his interview with Radio Prague he said: "I feel good, great! The food was varied and there were even enough greens in the garnish. As for beer, I tried to alternate brands but I always settled it with Pilsner. I liked the experiment, it was all paid for by the distributor, Aerofilms. I would do it again, maybe they will propose it to me!" 

Zuzana Pudilova of Aerofilms said: "The result of the experiment is surprising - both for us and the experts who monitored it. The medical report says our volunteer has lost weight and his blood sugar has dropped. So we have come to the conclusion that fatty Czech pub grub is not all that bad for you - which I guess wasn't meant to be the result of the experiment at all."

A 73-year-old &lt;a href="w%3ABuddhism"&gt;Buddhist&lt;/a&gt; priest and temple nursery school director was arrested for soliciting a child prostitute, police reported on Friday.

Itsushi Ehara, chief priest of Komyoji Temple in Aki-ku, &lt;a href="w%3AHiroshima"&gt;Hiroshima&lt;/a&gt;, is alleged to have violated the Japanese Anti-Child Prostitution and Pornography Law.

Police state that Ehara admitted to the allegations during questioning, responding "I did it to alleviate my work stress." Police also claim that he confessed to membership in child prostitution clubs, and has paid several high school girls to have sex with him on more than 20 occasions.

Tokyo police allege that Ehara paid 80,000 yen to a 15-year-old girl, a first-year high school student, to have sex with him at a hotel in Shinjuku-ku, &lt;a href="Tokyo"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;, in August 2004.

After journeying seven months to reach its destination, the &lt;a href="w%3AMars%20Reconnaissance%20Orbiter"&gt;Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter&lt;/a&gt; entered the Martian orbit. The successful orbital maneuver garnered applause from NASA controllers at the &lt;a href="w%3AJet%20Propulsion%20Laboratory"&gt;Jet Propulsion Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; in Pasadena, California.

On Friday, the orbiter made a 27-minute engine burn. The maneuver slowed the orbiter down twenty percent to 27,000 kilometers (11,000 miles) per hour and put the satellite into an elliptical orbit set to bring it within 400 kilometers (250 miles) of the Martian surface.

As of now, the European Space Agency's Mars Express along with NASA's Mars Global Surveyor and &lt;a href="w%3AMars%20Odyssey"&gt;Mars Odyssey&lt;/a&gt; are orbiting the planet. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter will make it the fourth satellite monitoring Mars.

The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter was launched seven months ago on August 12, 2005. The orbiter was outfitted with the most powerful monitoring equipment ever sent to research the planet. The craft is equipped and designed to recover more data than all other previous missions combined.

&lt;a href="w%3AGale%20Norton"&gt;Gale Norton&lt;/a&gt; announced her resignation today as &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Interior"&gt;Secretary of the Interior&lt;/a&gt;, effective at the end of March. She stated that she was leaving for "personal reasons." The announcement came as the &lt;a href="US%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; Indian Affairs Committee investigates &lt;a href="Jack%20Abramoff"&gt;Jack Abramoff&lt;/a&gt;. E-mails seen by the Committee have suggested that there was a close relationship between Abramoff and Norton's former deputy, Steven Griles. According to &lt;a href="John%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt;, R-&lt;a href="Arizona"&gt;Ariz.&lt;/a&gt;, Abramoff gained access to Griles by promising donations from his clients to Italia Federici.

During her tenure in the Department of the Interior, Norton supported drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and opened other public land for drilling.

The President has nominated &lt;a href="w%3ADirk%20Kempthorne"&gt;Dirk Kempthorne&lt;/a&gt;, the current Governor of &lt;a href="Idaho"&gt;Idaho&lt;/a&gt; to replace her. By tradition this particular secretary comes from a &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20United%20States"&gt;western state&lt;/a&gt; or territory.

&lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Fox%20%28activist%29"&gt;Tom Fox&lt;/a&gt;, an American who was among four Christian activists kidnapped in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; in November last year, has been found dead, according to the U.S. State Department.

&lt;a href="w%3AFBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; spokesman Noel Clay reports that a body found Friday morning was Fox, 54, of &lt;a href="w%3AClear%20Brook%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Clear Brook, Virginia&lt;/a&gt;.

According to Iraqi officials, Fox's body had been found with gunshot wounds and his hands tied. Officials also say that he was beaten before his death.

According to Clay, further tests will be done in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;; the U.S. Embassy in &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad%2C%20Iraq"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt; is still investigating. Clay also said that "the State Department continues to call for the unconditional release of all other hostages".

Al-Jazeera aired video footage on Tuesday of the other three hostages, Canadians James Loney, 41, Harmeet Sooden, 32, and Norman Kember, 74, from Great Britain. The three had not been heard from since last year. The recent video release of them was filmed on February 28.

With three days until the start of the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Commonwealth%20Games"&gt;2006 Commonwealth Games&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne"&gt;Melbourne,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, organisers still have some 12,000 tickets yet unsold after mailing out some 150,000 invitations to buy tickets to the Games' opening ceremony. At least 40 invitations were sent to the families of 40 deceased people. Organisers have since apologised for this mistake.

Melbourne 2006 chief executive John Harnden says: “Opening ceremony sales are going well…We've sold about 4000 tickets over the last seven days, [and] those rates of sales are continuing... Overall, the rate of sales for tickets are fantastic ... it's an enormous number – bigger than any other Commonwealth Games ever sold." Tickets to the opening ceremony cost $590AUD. 

The XVIII Commonwealth Games will be held from March 15th through the 26th. The Opening Ceremony will be held Wednesday night. It will be opened officially by &lt;a href="w%3AQueen%20Elizabeth%20II"&gt;Queen Elizabeth II&lt;/a&gt;.

Former Yugoslavian president &lt;a href="w%3ASlobodan%20Milo%C5%A1evi%C4%87"&gt;Slobodan Milošević&lt;/a&gt;, 64, has died in the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Criminal%20Tribunal%20for%20the%20Former%20Yugoslavia"&gt;U.N. war crimes tribunal&lt;/a&gt; detention center in &lt;a href="w%3AHague"&gt;The Hague&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANetherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="w%3ASocialist%20Party%20of%20Serbia"&gt;Serbian Socialist party&lt;/a&gt; and UN officials confirmed his death, and Tribunal President &lt;a href="w%3AFausto%20Pocar"&gt;Fausto Pocar&lt;/a&gt; has ordered an inquiry, which will be done by the Dutch police and the Dutch coroner. A &lt;a href="w%3AToxicology"&gt;toxicological&lt;/a&gt; examination and a full &lt;a href="w%3AAutopsy"&gt;autopsy&lt;/a&gt; have also been ordered on Milošević. 

A statement said that Milošević "was found lifeless on his bed in his cell at the United Nations detention unit. The guard immediately alerted the detention unit officer in command and the medical officer. The latter confirmed that Slobodan Milošević was dead." 

French Foreign Minister &lt;a href="w%3APhilippe%20Douste-Blazy"&gt;Philippe Douste-Blazy&lt;/a&gt; said that Milošević died of natural causes. He had been suffering from chronic heart problems and &lt;a href="w%3AHypertension"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;.

March 3 blood samples from Mr. Milošević showed traces of &lt;a href="w%3ARifampicin"&gt;rifampicin&lt;/a&gt;, an antibiotic used to treat serious bacterial infections like &lt;a href="w%3ATuberculosis"&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALeprosy"&gt;leprosy&lt;/a&gt;. 

Zdenko Tomanović, his defence lawyer, quoted Mr. Milošević as saying, "I have never taken any antibiotic in five years." Mr. Milošević claimed the day before he died that people with an interest in silencing him were trying to poison him.

An adviser to the chief prosecutor reported "He has a proven track record of taking unprescribed medicine, of messing with his medication," and suggested the complete cause of death may never be known.

The trial against Milošević had been delayed 20 times due to health problems. In 2002 judges ordered a psychiatric review to determine the strain the trial was putting on him. In late February the Tribunal denied his petition for a transfer to a hospital in Russia.

Milošević was on trial and charged with more than 60 counts of &lt;a href="w%3Agenocide"&gt;genocide&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACrime%20against%20humanity"&gt;crimes against humanity&lt;/a&gt; for the role he played in the Balkan wars, which includes the massacre of 8,000 Muslims at &lt;a href="w%3ASrebrenica%20massacre"&gt;Srebrenica&lt;/a&gt; in 1995 and emanating from the Bosnian conflict. 

He was extradited to The Hague in 2001, and his trial began in 2002. He refused to be given a lawyer and was defending himself in court, pleading not guilty to all charges against him. He faced life in prison.

Milošević served as president of the &lt;a href="w%3ASerbia"&gt;Republic of Serbia&lt;/a&gt; from 1989 to 1997, and the president of &lt;a href="w%3ASerbia%20and%20Montenegro"&gt;Federal Republic of Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt; from 1997 to 2000.

The Associated Press has reported that the United States Department of Agriculture is currently investigating a possible case of &lt;a href="w%3Amad%20cow%20disease"&gt;mad cow disease&lt;/a&gt;. USDA official John Clifford said that a routine test indicated the possible presence of the disease.

The Agriculture Department says that the first test was inconclusive and that further tests are being conducted in the department's laboratory in &lt;a href="w%3AAmes%2C%20Iowa"&gt;Ames, Iowa&lt;/a&gt;; however, those test results for &lt;a href="w%3ABovine%20spongiform%20encephalopathy"&gt;bovine spongiform encephalopathy&lt;/a&gt; (BSE) will not be available for at least 4-7 days.

"This inconclusive result does not mean we have found a new case of BSE. Inconclusive results are a normal component of most screening tests, which are designed to be extremely sensitive," said Clifford. "We remain very confident in the safety of U.S. beef."

Clifford also stated that no parts of the cow have entered the human food or animal feed chain. 

At least 150 human deaths worldwide have been linked to the consumption of affected cattle, most in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. One case of the disease was reported in a human in the U.S., but the Centers for Disease Control believe that the individual got it while traveling in the U.K.

The U.S. has had a total of two previously confirmed cases of the disease. The most recent occurred in June when, for the first time, a calf born in the U.S. tested positive for the disease. The first case was in December 2003 when the disease was found in a cow born in Canada located at a &lt;a href="w%3AWashington"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; State farm.

On March 3, the EU confirmed &lt;a href="w%3ASweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;'s first case of mad cow disease. &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; reported its fourth case of mad cow disease in January.

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; has nominated &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20McCallum%2C%20Jr."&gt;Robert Davis McCallum, Jr.&lt;/a&gt; to be the new US Ambassador to &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;. The ambassadorship has been vacant for 12 months and 28 days.

McCallum is an associate attorney-general for the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice"&gt;Department of Justice&lt;/a&gt; and previously represented &lt;a href="w%3ABig%20Tobacco"&gt;big tobacco&lt;/a&gt; companies at an &lt;a href="w%3AAtlanta"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt; law firm. He also has a master's degree from &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Oxford"&gt;Oxford University&lt;/a&gt; and is a &lt;a href="w%3ARhodes%20Scholarship"&gt;Rhodes Scholar&lt;/a&gt; as well as having a bachelor's degree from &lt;a href="w%3AYale%20University"&gt;Yale&lt;/a&gt;.

Former deputy secretary of state, Richard Armitage, said earlier this month that the fact Australia was still without an ambassador might indicate a "lackadaisical attitude" to the region.

McCallum is one of the 15 &lt;a href="w%3ASkull%20and%20Bones"&gt;Skull and Bones&lt;/a&gt; members from the 1968 group, of which President Bush was also a member.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
When you mix a shopping cart, six team members, bar hopping and bonus points for schmoozing bar hostesses and sabotaging your enemies, you get the annual &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; Idiotarod race. On Saturday, this bizarre fund raising event, which originated in &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; 13 years ago, pitted teams of "sleds" together to race from bar to bar in Washington, D.C.'s fashionable &lt;a href="w%3ADupont_Circle"&gt;Dupont Circle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAdams%20Morgan"&gt;Adams Morgan&lt;/a&gt; neighborhoods. Each "sled" consists of a "borrowed" shopping cart and six human dogs to pull the cart. Points are given for originality, the best time and best sabotage of another sled.

The race is held to benefit the Arlington Food Assistance Center and is organized by Ellen Shortill and Kristen Heatherly. Their organization, called "&lt;a href="http%3A//smashed.geekpad.com"&gt;SMASHED&lt;/a&gt;" or "Society for Mature Adults Seeking to Help, Entertain and Donate", takes the position that donating small amounts many times ultimately benefits the smaller charities. Said Shortill, "Our goal is simply to have fun and raise money for those charities that don't really get any attention." 

The race this year consisted of &lt;a href="http%3A//smashed.geekpad.com/idiotarod/Race%2520Results.html"&gt;22 teams&lt;/a&gt;. Although team "Save NOLA" got to the last bar first, teams can win bonus points for (among other things) flirting with bar hosts and hostesses at any of the five bars along the route. The route is approximately 3 miles long, and each team is required to spend at least 20 minutes in each bar. Heatherly noted that "it doesn't matter who got here first, ultimately its the team with the most credits and the best time that wins." 

Unique among the participants are brothers Pete and Chris Magnuson who are attempting to get on the 10th edition of &lt;a href="w%3AAmazing%20Race"&gt;Amazing Race&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="w%3ACBS"&gt;CBS&lt;/a&gt;. Their team called &lt;a href="http%3A//www.pickpeteandchris.com"&gt;"Pick Pete and Chris"&lt;/a&gt; ran through the streets with t-shirts hawking their website and their fervent desire to be chosen for the next edition of the television show.

"Its not really about who wins, its that we get to have a blast and raise some money," said Shortill. The charity event raised about $500 and various canned goods for the food pantry.

Snow storms and strong winds have disrupted travel around much of Scotland, northern England and parts of Wales. The storms follow earlier unseasonal snow storms on &lt;a href="w%3AMarch%202"&gt;March 2&lt;/a&gt;. Snow is relatively unusual in March in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. As snow fell on a Sunday, schools have not been disrupted as they would be closed anyway, but many businesses have been forced to remain closed.

The man that took a woman and her newborn baby hostage has been arrested by the police. He made no demands, neither has it been confirmed whether he had a gun. Nobody suffered any injuries in the incident. The 32-year-old man was the woman's ex-boyfriend.

He entered the room in the hospital in &lt;a href="w%3AEschweiler"&gt;Eschweiler&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, where a woman and her new born child lay. He took them both hostage, no contact was achieved, and his eventual demands are not known. The smell of fuel was reported from the hospital, and part of the hospital was evacuated as police and fire department entered the building.

Jana Tylova, a 31-year-old Czech woman, came from behind to win the inaugural Sudoku world championships to become the top &lt;a href="w%3Asudoku"&gt;sudoku&lt;/a&gt; player in the world. Tylova works as an accountant for a construction company in the Czech city of Most, and she beat 85 players from 22 countries.

A graduate student from Harvard University, Thomas Snyder, who had been leading, came in second and Wei-Ha Huang, a 30-year-old Google software engineer in California, came third.

Tylova, the only woman in the top 18, finished only ninth after the first round before passing all the men to claim the championship. She is already being called "Queen Jana of Sudoku".

"There is no difference between men and women, and I tried to prove that even in logic, men and women are on the same level", said Tylova as people cheered loudly. Jana smiled shyly while accepting her trophy from Wayne Gould who came upon Sudoku in Japan and popularised the game worldwide.

Jana told reporters: "I find it very difficult to give advice at all, but I can advise people to practice every day and to follow websites where there are a lot of games available." Tylova revealed that before competitions she played sudoku two hours per day. "It will probably be more now", she said. She showjumps with her horse Impulse during the rest of her spare time.

Austria, Belgium, Britain, Czech Republic, Croatia, Denmark, France, Germany, Poland, Hungary, the Netherlands, India, Italy, Japan, Venezuela, Switzerland, the United States, the Philippines, Estonia, Slovakia and Turkey were the countries represented in the championship contest.

The &lt;a href="w%3AMars%20Reconnaissance%20Orbiter"&gt;Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter&lt;/a&gt;'s two-year mission is expected to gather more information about Mars than all 12 previous successful missions put together.

The MRO's tasks will include scouting for possible future landing sites, analyzing the planet's atmosphere, monitoring its weather, and searching for locations where there may have been water in the distant past. The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;450 million spacecraft is the most advanced probe so far sent to Mars, and can radio back 10 times more data to Earth than any previous probe. Cameras on the MRO can see objects on the planet the size of a card table.

After its seven-month journey toward the planet, reaching orbit was a critical step. Several previous probes have failed due to the difficulty of the precise timing needed to keep the spacecraft from being pulled in by the planet's gravity. Twenty-one of the thirty-three previous probes have failed for some reason to complete their missions.

Project manager Jim Graf, who described himself as "relieved" at the "picture perfect" completion of this step, expects the results to "rewrite the science textbooks on Mars." The next step is for the craft to begin "aerobraking" to slow down and change its orbit from elliptical to circular.

The total cost of the mission, including the spacecraft, launch, and support team, is US$720 million.

A &lt;a href="w%3AUN"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Commission%20on%20Human%20Rights"&gt;(UNCHR)&lt;/a&gt; committee on the &lt;a href="w%3AConvention%20on%20the%20Elimination%20of%20All%20Forms%20of%20Racial%20Discrimination"&gt;Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD)&lt;/a&gt; found the &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20government%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;the US government&lt;/a&gt; in violation of &lt;a href="w%3ANative%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States"&gt;Native Americans'&lt;/a&gt; land rights and the international anti-racism convention.
The committee of 18 independent experts said in a press release that it had received credible information alleging that Western &lt;a href="w%3AShoshone"&gt;Shoshone&lt;/a&gt; peoples were being denied their traditional right to land. The decision details US actions against the &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20Shoshone"&gt;Western Shoshone&lt;/a&gt; and calls upon the United States to immediately:

<ul>
BULLET::::- Respect and protect the human rights of the Western Shoshone peoples.
BULLET::::- Initiate a dialogue with the representatives of the Western Shoshone peoples in order to find a solution acceptable to them, and which complies with their rights.
BULLET::::- Adopt the following measures until a final decision or settlement is reached on the status, use and occupation of Western Shoshone ancestral lands in accordance with due process of law and US obligations under the Convention.
BULLET::::- Freeze all efforts to privatize Western Shoshone ancestral lands for transfer to multinational extractive industries and energy developers.
BULLET::::- Desist from all activities planned and/or conducted on Western Shoshone ancestral lands.
BULLET::::- Stop imposing grazing fees, livestock impoundments, and hunting, fishing and gathering restrictions; and rescind all notices already given.
</ul>
Bernice Lalo, Western Shoshone delegate, said, "The mines are polluting our waters, destroying hot springs and exploding sacred mountains&amp;mdash;our burials along with them&amp;mdash;attempting to erase our signature on the land. We are coerced and threatened by mining and Federal agencies when we seek to continue spiritual prayers for traditional food or medicine on Shoshone land." Mr. Lalo continued, "We feel the decision will be helpful by opening the door. We will continue this struggle to give our children a better chance."

Joe Kennedy, a Western Shoshone, said, "We have rights to protect our homelands and stop the destruction of our land, water, and air by the abuses of the United States government and the multinational corporations. He said, "The situation is outrageous, and we're glad the United Nations Committee agrees with us."

Laura Inouye, &lt;a href="w%3AOxfam"&gt;Oxfam&lt;/a&gt; America, said, "This is a tremendous victory for the Shoshone people; the UN decision acknowledges the U.S. government's violations of Shoshone civil, political, economic, and cultural rights." Inouye concluded, "Hopefully, they will now be granted the justice that the US government has denied them for years." Oxfam America is a human rights organizaition which has backed the Western Shoshone.

A UN official said, according to the AP, that the US mission to the UN in Geneva had no immediate response to the decision.

The Western Shoshones' rights to the land, 60 million acres stretching across &lt;a href="w%3ANevada"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIdaho"&gt;Idaho&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUtah"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;Califonia&lt;/a&gt;, were recognized by the US under the &lt;a href="w%3ATreaty%20of%20Ruby%20Valley%201863"&gt;1863 Treaty of Ruby Valley&lt;/a&gt;, which was signed by &lt;a href="w%3AUlysses%20S.%20Grant"&gt;President Ulysses S. Grant&lt;/a&gt; a few years later. 
It was questioned by &lt;a href="w%3ASupreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;the US Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt;, 1979; the land was labeled 'government trusteeship' and much was claimed as federal territory. &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; signed a bill in July 2004 that gave approval to distributing more than $145 million as compensation after the Shoshones voted to accept the distribution in a disputed election. 

Jim Manley, a spokesman for &lt;a href="w%3AHarry%20Reid"&gt;Sen. Harry Reid&lt;/a&gt; (D. Nevada) and a proponent of the bill, said "The tribe twice has voted decisively in favor of the distribution."

A ban against kite-flying during a traditional festival to welcome the onset of spring in the &lt;a href="w%3APunjab%20%28Pakistan%29"&gt;Punjab&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; has led to significant numbers of arrests. Conservative figures put the number arrested following the imposition of Thursday's ban at around 500, higher figures of 1,400 are given in Australian reports which describe events following the ban as a crackdown.

At issue is the use of glass coated or metal kite strings, and this leading towards serious injury or even death. In the 2004 celebration of the Basant festival up to nine people were killed including from electrocution when using metal strings.

&lt;a href="Elizabeth%20II%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom"&gt;Queen Elizabeth II&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APrince%20Philip%2C%20Duke%20of%20Edinburgh"&gt;Prince Phillip&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; arrived in &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; yesterday for a five-day tour which includes the opening of the 2006 &lt;a href="Commonwealth%20Games"&gt;Commonwealth Games&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Melbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, the Queen's 15th visit of her reign and her first since 2002.

Their tour began when they landed at Fairburn Air Force Base in &lt;a href="Canberra"&gt;Canberra&lt;/a&gt; where they received a state welcome, attended by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGovernor%20General%20of%20Australia"&gt;Governor-General&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Major General &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Jeffery"&gt;Michael Jeffery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and several hundred well-wishers. The couple accepted flowers and chatted with the crowd for a few minutes before being driven off in a black Rolls Royce.

The Queen and Prince Philip spent last night at Government House before beginning official duties in &lt;a href="Sydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; today. In Sydney, they will officially open the new colonnade of &lt;a href="Sydney%20Opera%20House"&gt;Sydney Opera House&lt;/a&gt; and receive a 21 gun salute.

Republican campaigners have used the occasion as an opportunity to reopen the republican debate.

"While the queen is held in great affection by the Australian people, many Australians recognize that it is no longer sensible for us to have a citizen of another country, who visits Australia only occasionally, as our head of state," said Allison Henry, national director of the Australian Republican Movement.

Mayra Ramirez, a 16 year old &lt;a href="w%3AChicago"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, USA student is blind. In order to graduate, she and dozens of other visually impaired students in Chicago schools are required to pass a written rules-of-the-road exam. "In other classes, you don't really feel different because you can do the work other people do," Ramirez said. "But in driver's ed, it does give us the feeling we're different. In a way, it brought me down, because it reminds me of something I can't do."

Michael Vaughn, a spokesman for Chicago schools said, "I can't explain why up to this point no one has raised the issue and suggested a better way for visually impaired students to opt out of driver's ed."

Blind students are typically told that they must take the class to graduate; although, by law, any parent can request a change in a disabled student's education plan. This law is rarely, if ever, disclosed to the students, according to the &lt;a href="w%3AChicago_Tribune"&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATamiflu"&gt;Tamiflu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (generic name: Oseltamivir) a common antiviral drug used in the treatment and prophylaxis of both Influenza virus A and Influenza virus B, will be marketed in a generic form in &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;. It is a prodrug, which is hydrolysed hepatically to the active metabolite, the free carboxylate of oseltamivir. It was developed by Gilead Sciences and is currently marketed by Hoffmann-La Roche (Roche) under the trade name Tamiflu.

Cipla received marketing approval from the drug controller-general of India and will launch a generic version of Oseltamivir, Anti-Flu, in the domestic market this month. The drug will be priced at about Rs 1,000 per strip of 10 75 mg tablets, which is less than half the current Tamiflu market price of $60. The required dosage is two tablets every day during five days.

The Alaska Wilderness League reports that there is "no confirmation" of the quantity of oil lost; but it points out that it is not only the oil that causes problems. The cleanup efforts will also have environmental impacts.

The &lt;a href="Associated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; first reported this spill on 2 March.

2006 was the deadliest Datona Beach Bike Week ever, with a total of 18 bikers being killed on Florida roads, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. This year's festivities brought in about 500,000 bikers to the Daytona area, and 14 of those killed were from Florida. Walter Fliss, 51, had recently bought his motorcycle before being killed when he drove into a construction site. Another biker rode into a guardrail, and others were killed on their way home.

If you thought &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle%20Maps"&gt;Google Maps&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle%20Earth"&gt;Google Earth&lt;/a&gt; and was enough, then meet Google Mars. 

Google officially launched the new Google Mars yesterday as another add-on to Google Maps. The service offers three different ways to view Mars: elevation, visible landscape, and infrared view. The images come from two different NASA missions, Mars Global Surveyor and 2001 Mars Odyssey, and the data was prepared in collaboration with NASA researchers at Arizona State University.

The color-coded elevation data is a shaded-relief map taken by the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) on NASA's Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft. The visible data is made from black and white images taken by the Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC), which is also located onboard the Mars Global Surveyor, and the infrared images were produced by the Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) on NASA's Mars Odyssey spacecraft. The THEMIS data is the sharpest map of Mars made so far, as it shows colder areas in darker colors and warmer regions in brighter colors, and as they are infrared images dust and clouds are transparent.

Google has added various bookmarks showing points of interest such as landings of spacecraft, locations of mountains, and craters. 

The data is not currently available through Google's Google Earth client.

Reports indicate that over 6,000 officers are involved in policing the event, but no trouble is anticipated. Police do not intend to prevent the protesters from marching to Government House.

This latest large-scale protest against the caretaker Prime Minister is likely the most significant since the February 26 protest, and with pro-Thaksin groups making their way to &lt;a href="w%3ABangkok"&gt;Bangkok&lt;/a&gt;, the bloody confrontation of 1992 has been brought up as a reminder. Free to air TV stations have broadcast coverage of the King's intercession in the '92 dispute, where a popular uprising had been met with a military crackdown. Panthep Puapongpant, a PAD representative, indicated that the protest for Tuesday morning would take heed of the advice and proceed peacefully. Concerns over a potential clash with pro-Thaksin groups have been averted as a result of the PM's supporters planning their rally for March 16.

With voters' choices in the upcoming April 2 election already severely restricted due to the three main opposition parties' boycott, the disqualification of candidates from minor parties further reduces the options open to those who don't boycott the election. Up to 200 may be disqualified for reasons such as holding party membership for less than 90 days or having membership in more than one party.

The U.S. Senate is debating the 2007 budget this week, dealing with, among many things, controversial issues such as the oil drilling in Alaska, raising the national debt ceiling, and an amendment that would fund $1.5 million dollars to veterans' health-care. The Senate is also considering budget measures over an amendment that would increase funding for local and state law enforcement to combat methamphetamine.

The national debt ceiling is supposed to prevent the U.S. public debt from growing to excessive amounts. If the national debt grows to reach beyond a previously budgeted ceiling level, branches of government are shut down and provide only limited services. The shut down force a reduction in spending. The measure is meant to prevent excessive amounts of national debt from occurring. Rather than letting the level of national debt approach that ceiling, it is typical practice within the U.S. Congress to raise the national debt ceiling annually.

The $781 billion increase asked for this year is the fourth hike request in the last five years. Bush administration budgets have pushed debt ceiling increase request to a level of 46% higher over five years, a $3 trillion increase.

Senator Judd Gregg, Budget Committee Chairman, argued in favor of increasing the ceiling, citing growths in the economy under the Bush administration. Kent Conrad, ranking Democrat member of the Budget Committee, rebutted that the economy has not been recovering as well as it has been after World War II and six other similar recovery periods, and that the economic period after World War II averaged 3.2% in growth.

A "PAYGO" amendment by Conrad Burns would have required offsetts for any new spending beyond the original resolution. It failed, needing 51 votes, but receiving 50. Lincoln Chafee's amendment would increase funding by $2 billion for the Americans with Disabilities Act.

The &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; National Development and Reform Commission approved today the plans by &lt;a href="w%3ANanjing%20Automobile%20Group"&gt;Nanjing Automobile Group&lt;/a&gt; to revive the &lt;a href="w%3AMG%20Rover%20Group"&gt;MG Rover&lt;/a&gt; brand. 

Nanjing Automobile are planning to annually produce 200,000 cars, 250,000 engines and 100,000 gearboxes on the assembly lines purchased from MG Rover.

The first MG produced in Pukou in &lt;a href="w%3ANanjing"&gt;Nanjing&lt;/a&gt; in the east of China will be the sedan version of &lt;a href="w%3ARover%2075"&gt;MG-75&lt;/a&gt;, in the first half of 2007.

The Internet group that once solicited complaints for a class action suit against &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; has shut up shop and revealed its roots. Claiming to have been prompted by the John Seigenthaler &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Seigenthaler%20Sr.%20Wikipedia%20biography%20controversy"&gt;Wikipedia biography controversy&lt;/a&gt;, the site http://www.wikipediaclassaction.org once sought parties to build a defamation suit against the wiki-based encyclopedia. Today, that site points to the &lt;a href="w%3AOfficialwire"&gt;Officialwire&lt;/a&gt; news service, known to be associated with &lt;a href="w%3AGreg%20Lloyd%20Smith"&gt;Greg Lloyd Smith&lt;/a&gt;. The long-standing Wikipedia-alleged association between Officialwire and the &lt;a href="w%3AQuakeAID"&gt;QuakeAID&lt;/a&gt; "charity" has also been confirmed due to that site being replaced with a similar redirection.

The class action website was initially registered to one &lt;a href="w%3AJennifer%20Monroe"&gt;Jennifer Monroe&lt;/a&gt; who is affiliated with QuakeAID, an organisation which Wikipedia editors have accused of being a scam following QuakeAID personnel having created their own article on Wikipedia last year. This came at the time of the &lt;a href="w%3A2005%20Indian%20Ocean%20earthquake"&gt;Indian Ocean earthquake&lt;/a&gt;, when Wikipedia user Baoutrust added QuakeAID to Wikipedia's &lt;a href="w%3ADonations%20for%20victims%20of%20the%202004%20Indian%20Ocean%20earthquake"&gt;victim donations&lt;/a&gt; page and sparked a dispute about the legitimacy of the organisation. Wikipedia editors did not acknowledge the tax-exempt status of the organisation which QuakeAID displayed on its home page; however, this can now only be seen via Google's cache. The 501(c) registration QuakeAID used to list is generally accepted as what defines an organisation as a charity with the United States. However, a number of groups removed QuakeAID from their public lists of charities following the Wikipedia dispute.

The dispute between QuakeAID and Wikipedia editors sparked a negative publicity campaign waged via Baou Trust's news service, OfficialWire. A number of articles which portray Wikipedia, or Wikipedians in a bad light have been published on the service. The site for the proposed class-action suit provides a link displaying results of a search of OfficialWire for stories about Wikipedia. This is not the first instance of the directors of Baou Trust using their newswire to run a smear campaign: a long-running campaign against former directors of the equity company IEQ was mounted following Greg Lloyd Smith's hostile takeover of the firm.

Smith is no stranger to controversy, having been the target of legal action by &lt;a href="w%3AAmazon.com"&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt; when he registered the Amazon.gr and Amazon.com.gr sites and set up an Amazon.com look-alike selling Greek-language books. Amazon initially filed suit in Greece, and later in the US where their complaint described initial communication from Smith as a "thinly-veiled shakedown" when he offered to sell a controlling interest in CITI to the company for $1.6 million. The Amazon suit sought triple damages under &lt;a href="w%3ARacketeer%20Influenced%20and%20Corrupt%20Organizations%20Act"&gt;RICO&lt;/a&gt; statutes stating, "Fraudulent acts of mail and wire fraud, extortion and criminal copyright infringement constitute a pattern of racketeering, and pose a threat to society."

John Clifford, Chief Veterinarian of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Agriculture"&gt;Department of Agriculture&lt;/a&gt;, confirms that tests done on a sample from a cow on a farm in &lt;a href="w%3AAlabama"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt; indicate &lt;a href="w%3ABovine%20spongiform%20encephalopathy"&gt;bovine spongiform encephalopathy&lt;/a&gt; or ♡❤mad cow disease♡❤. The original results were confirmed by a &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20blot"&gt;Western Blot Test&lt;/a&gt;. 

"We received a positive result on a Western blot confirmatory test conducted at the USDA laboratories in &lt;a href="w%3AAmes%2C%20Iowa"&gt;Ames, Iowa&lt;/a&gt;, on samples from an animal that had tested 'inconclusive' on a rapid screening test performed on Friday, March 10, 2006. In this instance, the inconclusive result from the contract lab in &lt;a href="w%3AGeorgia"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt; was confirmed through a second rapid test at the National Veterinary Services Laboratory. Now, the Western blot test has returned a positive result, and that is sufficient for us to confirm this animal to be positive for BSE, which is why we are making this announcement today," said Clifford.

"The samples were taken from a non-ambulatory animal on a farm in Alabama. A local private veterinarian euthanized and sampled the animal and sent the samples for further testing, which was conducted at one of our contract diagnostic laboratories at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Georgia"&gt;University of Georgia&lt;/a&gt;. The animal was buried on the farm, and it did not enter the animal or human food chains," he added.

Clifford also says the cow was at least ten years old, explaining, "While epidemiological work to determine the animal’s precise age is just getting under way and is ongoing, the attending veterinarian has indicated that, based on dentition, it was an older animal, quite possibly upwards of 10 years of age. This would indicate that this animal would have been born prior to the implementation of the Food and Drug Administration’s 1997 feed ban," and that they are still looking into where the cow could have been born and raised. The cow had only been on the Alabama farm for about a year. Clifford also confirmed that the cow was meant for producing beef.

"We will be working to locate animals from this cow’s birth cohort and any offspring," said Clifford. A birth cohort identifies animals born in the same herd within one year of the affected animal.

Clifford also adds that no part of the cow made it into the human food chain, saying, "I want to emphasize that human and animal health in the United States are protected by a system of interlocking safeguards, and that we remain very confident in the safety of U.S. beef. Again, this animal did not enter the human food or animal feed chains."

This is the third case of Mad Cow disease in the U.S. The first case turned up in December of 2003, when a cow from a &lt;a href="w%3AWashington"&gt;Washington State&lt;/a&gt; farm, born in &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, tested positive for the disease. 

The second cow to test positive for the disease, found last June, was born on a farm in &lt;a href="w%3ATexas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;.

On March 1, 2006, &lt;a href="w%3ASweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; announced its first possible case of Mad Cow disease, and on January 23, Canada announced its fourth case of the disease. 

Worldwide, at least 150 people have died from &lt;a href="w%3ACreutzfeldt-Jakob%20disease"&gt;variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease&lt;/a&gt;, which is linked to Mad Cow disease.

Britain announced Monday it will reduce its troop level in Iraq by 10 percent (about 800 troops) within the next two months. Defense Secretary John Reid said that Iraqi security forces are more capable of handling security in the country.

Reid told the House of Commons; "Our commitment to the coalition remains certain. This is a significant reduction which is based largely on the ability of the Iraqis themselves to participate and defend themselves against terrorism, but there is a long, long way to go."

During combat operations in the spring of 2003, Britain had 46,000 military personnel in Iraq. By May of 2004 the level had dropped to 18,000, and then to 8,500 by the end of 2005.

Mr Reid said that the reduction had not been prompted by escalating violence against British troops in Iraq.

U.S. military spokesman, Lt. Col. Barry Johnson, said it was "each nation's prerogative and decision on how to best support the coalition effort."

&lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; has announced that the &lt;a href="w%3ACassini"&gt;Cassini&lt;/a&gt; spacecraft has found what seem to be &lt;a href="w%3AGeyser"&gt;geysers&lt;/a&gt; spewing water on the moon &lt;a href="w%3AEnceladus%20%28moon%29"&gt;Enceladus&lt;/a&gt;. The find raises the possibility of life on other planets, as liquid water is believed to be a requirement for life. "This marks the first time that scientists have seen evidence of water in liquid form so close to the surface on another body beyond Earth," said Cassini scientist Torrence Johnson. Although life may be found on the moon, most scientists concede that if Enceladus does harbor life, it probably consists of &lt;a href="w%3AMicroorganism"&gt;microbes&lt;/a&gt; or other robust organisms capable of living in extreme conditions. This latest discovery shows that life in other parts of the universe may be more probable than previously thought.

"We realize that this is a radical conclusion &amp;mdash; that we may have evidence for liquid water within a body so small and so cold," said Dr. &lt;a href="w%3ACarolyn%20Porco"&gt;Carolyn Porco&lt;/a&gt;, Cassini imaging team leader at the Space Science Institute, &lt;a href="w%3ABoulder%2C%20Colorado"&gt;Boulder, Colorado&lt;/a&gt;. "However, if we are right, we have significantly broadened the diversity of solar system environments where we might possibly have conditions suitable for living organisms."

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Warmest%20Canadian%20winter%20on%20record&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;br style="clear:both;"&gt;

The winter of 2005/2006 has been the warmest winter in &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; since the beginning of the nationwide weather record in 1948, with average nationwide temperatures 3.9°C above the long-term average. Statistically, such a strong deviation from the average is expected to be observed only once in 100 years. 

While most of the country was experiencing temperatures of at least 2°C above normal, in most of &lt;a href="w%3AAlberta"&gt;Alberta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASaskatchewan"&gt;Saskatchewan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ANorthwest%20Territories"&gt;Northwest Territories&lt;/a&gt; the temperatures were 6°C above normal, with some regions averaging up to 8°C above normal.

For this statistic the months from December through February were counted as winter.

Lack of ice in eastern Canada will probably affect the annual &lt;a href="w%3Aharp%20seal"&gt;harp seal&lt;/a&gt; hunt, which typically starts around March 15. In February, so little ice had formed that Environment Canada reported that such poor ice conditions had never been seen before in recorded history. The last time conditions approached what we saw in February 2006 was in 1969. The year 1981 was the third lowest ice year in recorded history.

In 1981, a number of harp seal mothers, who normally whelp only on ice, went to the shores of Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia and gave birth on land. That year, due to the lack of ice, hundreds of thousands of seal pups drowned. The seals who were born on land faced both natural dangers such as death by exposure, and the danger of death at the hands of thousands of sealers, both licensed and unlicensed. These sealers took this rare "opportunity" to walk right up to a baby seal and kill it. Some of these seals were also attacked by domestic dogs.

New South Wales Police say a 21-year-old woman has been charged in relation to the riots at Sydney's Cronulla Beach last year. She is the first woman to be arrested over reprisals from the December 11 race-fuelled riot. The woman was charged with affray, assaulting police, resisting arrest and disobeying police direction. She was refused bail.

Police said the charges related to the violent and anti-social behaviour of a large number of people who gathered at Brighton-le-Sands on the night of the Cronulla riot. 

Three men have also been arrested in relation to the Cronulla riot. A 19-year-old man handed himself into police yesterday and is due to face Parramatta Local Court charged with riot and affray. 

A 21-year-old man from Cronulla also yesterday handed himself into detectives from Strike Force Enoggera, which was set up to investigate the racial unrest. The man was among the 20 whose photos were released to the media last week.

Another man, whose photo was release to the media, handed himself in to police last night. He was charged with riot and affray and given conditional bail to appear at Sutherland Local Court on April 6.

Police say Strike Force Enoggera has arrested 78 people to date, with 189 charges laid.

AFP and Reuters have reported that Israeli troops have stormed the Palestinian jail in Jericho in a bid to snatch a prisoner Israel claims is responsible for the assassination of an Israeli Minister five years ago. There are reports that one Palestinian has been killed and at least 18 prisoners and security officials have been wounded.

The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) demanded the handover of six prisoners, including Ahmed Saadat 
the alleged instigator of the 2001 assassination of Israeli Cabinet minister Rehavam Zeevi. 

Israeli military officials issued a warning that unless the Jericho prisoners gave themselves up they would be killed. 

The leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine Ahmed Saadat told Al-Jazeera television in a telephone interview from the jail, "We are not going to surrender. We are going to face our destiny with courage." Mr Saadat told the BBC's Arabic Service, "The occupation are planning a massacre in the Jericho complex. There is shelling from all angles and destroying the prison from all sides." 

Saadat also said two of his colleagues had been killed. 
The troops opened fire with small arms and stun grenades. Israeli soldiers blew up the outer wall of the Jericho prison compound and IDF helicopters fired missiles into the prison. It has been reported that US and British monitors stationed there withdrew before Israeli troops arrived. The Israeli army moved in, bulldozing parts of the prison's outer compound and demanding Saadat's surrender. President Abbas blamed the British and the Americans for the developing crisis. In recent weeks, Abbas signalled he was willing to release Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) leader, Ahmed Saadat.

Reuters reports that protests have surged across Palestinian territories, with most anger directed at Britain and the United States. Militants set fire to the British cultural centre and stormed the EU compound in Gaza. There have been threats to kidnap and kill foreigners.

"This operation was ordered by the Prime Minister in the fight against terrorism. We are committed to the murderers of minister Rehavam Zeevi remaining behind bars," Gideon Ezra, Israel's Public Security Minister, told public radio.

<h1>Chinese Wikimania 2006 to be held in Hong Kong</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Chinese%20Wikimania%202006%20to%20be%20held%20in%20Hong%20Kong&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AChinese%20Wikipedia"&gt;Chinese community&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, the free encyclopedia, is planning for a 2006 Chinese Wikimedia conference (2006中文維基年會), which is scheduled on the 26th and 27th of August this year. &lt;a href="w%3AHong%20Kong"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt; has been selected, from six candidate cities, to hold the event. 

During selection of the host city, the Chinese community favored Hong Kong mostly, while &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei"&gt;Taipei&lt;/a&gt; was the second, and &lt;a href="w%3AShanghai"&gt;Shanghai&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABeijing"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt; were tied for the third. The leader of the organzing committee, &lt;a href="w%3Azh%3AUser%3AKaurjmeb"&gt;Kaurjmeb&lt;/a&gt; from Taipei, Taiwan, said that "Comparing the advantages and disadvantages, Hong Kong is much better than Taipei," when she announced the result late March 14th at midnight. She said that Hong Kong Wikipedia users have been active, and other users agreed with that, so it led to success for Hong Kong in being selected as the host city.

Wikipedia is a multilingual Web-based free-content encyclopedia. It is written collaboratively by volunteers, allowing most articles to be changed by anyone with access to a web browser and an Internet connection. Wikipedia's policies guide most acticles to be acceptable to most people. Begun in 2001, Wikipedia has more than 2,500,000 articles in 212 languages. The Chinese version, which started on October 2002, reached nearly 60,000 acticles recently, and the number is increasing by more than 3,000 acticles every month. Its users are from Mainland China (PRC), Taiwan (ROC) and other places all over the world. 

Thirteen percent of the users of the Chinese Wikipedia are from Hong Kong, and more than 6,000 Hongkongers have contributed by editing acticles. Due to the efforts of Hong Kong's active users, there is a lot of information related to Hong Kong. The aim of the Chinese Wikipedia conference is to gather the Chinese Wikipedia's users and other people, in order to discuss issues related to intellectual property, open educational resources and media etc., by means of talks and seminars.

Holding the event in Hong Kong enables people from Mainland China and Taiwan to meet together. Hong Kong users, however, mainly worry about whether the resources for holding such an event are enough. Luckily, the Student Union of the &lt;a href="w%3AChinese%20University%20of%20Hong%20Kong"&gt;Chinese University of Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt; is willing to give a hand. Ben Cheng, previous vice-president, pointed out, "Issues about intellectual property and Wikipedia are ignored in Hong Kong." They hope that helping to organize such events can promote Wikimedia and its meaning to the citzens in Hong Kong. On the other hand, another student organization, the Hong Kong Secondary Sudents Union, also showed its interest in helping with the organizing work. Rock Li, the internal secretary, said that "If the event is held in Hong Kong, people from Hong Kong will be more aware of intellectual property."

With cold westerly winds from the North Atlantic expected this weekend (March 18-19), Stockholm is likely to record its coldest month of March since 1942, with an average temperature of -6,4°C, and the snowiest March since 1970.

Temperatures are expected to stay over 0°C this week, but past weeks have been very cold, making this month the coldest in many years.

Up to now, snow has covered Stockholm for 78 days in a row, limiting heat absorption from the sun by reflecting sun rays away.

Very low temperatures have been recorded in several areas around the capital, but the average for this winter is far above the winter average of -9,6°C recorded back in 1942.

If any records are to be set for this winter, it’s likely to be the lack of deviations from the long-term winter average. It’s likely to be the most nearly average winter since 1907, thus making it very unusual indeed.

This year will also be the snowiest since the winter of 1969-1970, when snow coverage in Stockholm lasted from November 23 to April 20.

The national meteorological institute SMHI expects the daily average temperature to rise above zero at the end of the month.

Hayes, an outspoken &lt;a href="w%3AChurch%20of%20Scientology"&gt;Scientologist&lt;/a&gt;, said "There is a place in this world for satire, but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins," in reference to the &lt;a href="w%3ATrapped_in_the_Closet_%2528South_Park%2529"&gt;"Trapped in the Closet"&lt;/a&gt; episode which mocked the Church of Scientology and several celebrity followers.

Matt Stone, a co-creator of South Park, told the Associated Press that "This is 100 percent having to do with his faith of Scientology... He has no problem — and he's cashed plenty of checks — with our show making fun of Christians."

Stone claimed that "[Hayes] wants a different standard for religions other than his own, and to me, that is where intolerance and bigotry begin."

Trey Parker had earlier explained that Hayes was the only reason Scientology had not been the subject of a South Park episode sooner. He said, "To be honest, what kept us from doing it before was Isaac Hayes. We knew he was a Scientologist and he's an awesome guy. We were like, 'Let's just avoid that for now.'"

Stone &amp; Parker decided to create the episode after hearing that comedian &lt;a href="w%3APenn%20Jillette"&gt;Penn Jillette&lt;/a&gt; had been barred from poking fun at the controversial religion on his cable show ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABullshit%21"&gt;Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

In January of 2006, Comedy Central's United Kingdom affiliate removed the episode Trapped in the Closet from its broadcast schedule, reportedly to avoid legal action by actor &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Cruise"&gt;Tom Cruise&lt;/a&gt;.

According to an article by Roger Friedman at Foxnews on March 20th, Hayes might not have quit South Park himself. Friedman questions the statement of Mr. Hayes, and points to the information that Mr. Hayes suffered from a minor stroke on January 17th, and may not have been alone in the decision.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — The property at 605 Forest in Buffalo was the center of attention at last night's public meeting held at the offices of Forever Elmwood on Elmwood Avenue in Buffalo. Eva Hassett, Vice President of Savarino Construction Services Corporation, confirmed last night that the company will be seeking a variance for the 605 Forest property. Originally, both the 605 and 607 Forest Avenue properties were going to have variances placed on them. As it stands, 607 Forest will not be directly affected by the proposal, should it go forward. Both 605 and 607 are currently occupied by residents.

During Monday night's meeting, Pano Georgiadis, owner of 605 Forest and owner of Pano's Resuraunt at 1081 Elmwood Avenue in Buffalo, threatened to "sue" Savarino Construction if they tried to obtain a variance on his property to build the Elmwood Village Hotel.

The Elmwood Village Hotel is a proposal by Savarino Construction that would be placed on the corner of Forest and Elmwood in Buffalo. In order for the project to move forward, at least five buildings (1119-1121 Elmwood) which include both residences and businesses will have to be demolished. The hotel was designed by architect Karl Frizlen of the Frizlen Group. Although the properties are "under contract," according to Hassett, it is unclear whether Savarino Construction owns the properties. Hans Mobius, a resident of Clarence, New York and former Buffalo Mayoral candidate, is still believed to own them.

Currently, none of the properties is zoned for a hotel.

A freelance journalist writing for ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ asked Hassett what kind of zoning permit they [Savarino] would be applying for and, if 605 Forest is included, what zone that would be.
"There is a 'special development plan' in front of the council, which changes only one thing about the zoning. It allows one permitted use for just a hotel. The rest of the zoning remains as it is under the current Elmwood Business District zoning. 605 and 607 Forest are not required for the project. They are not part of the footprint for the project. Let me answer this question again. This is on the record, in council: 605 needs to be rezoned in order to facilitate the project because of the sideyard requirement. Anything in C-2 is excluded besides the hotel. So we've taken the C-2 and included the hotel as a permitted use, and excluded everything else and everything else remains the same."

However, during the February 28 Common Council meeting, Hassett was quoted as saying that the two properties were "off the agenda."

"Now Karl said, at the last meeting, that they will build this hotel right on the borderline [property line]. If a wall forty-five to fifty feet high goes next to this house, of course it's not right. You really have to go with whatever the city code says, so you have to get back as many feet as the city code says," said Georgiadis.

"If you try to get a variance to change the code, I will sue you. This is my home, number one," added Georgiadis. "First of all I think we are all wasting our time here, you [Savarino], have already made up your mind, but if you go against city code, and you try to do the most rooms with a minimal amount of parking, again, I will sue you. If you build a hotel, in my idea its going to fail. It's doomed, ok. [If] it's going to be a home for the disabled, for the homeless, for recovery people, but that's another story. Then how is it going to be when we say, well I told you so? You will be over and done with. Its very hard to take a four story building [hotel] down."

Georgiadis stated last night that he was against the proposal and signed a petition to stop it, jokingly saying, "this isn't a paper to sign to build the hotel, is it? Don't make me sign the wrong thing."

Joseph Golombeck, district councilman, was at Monday's public meeting and said, "we also did request this and the reason we are doing this as a special business district is so that it has to be this specific plan. They [Savarino] can't go halfway through it and in six months decide that [the hotel] it's going to be three floors. They can't decide it's going to be five floors. It has to be, per law, exactly what it is that they brought to us [the public] so far, and then ultimately to the City of Buffalo Common Council when it's approved. So if it gets approved, it has to be this specific, exact project. They couldn't make it fifty parking spots, they couldn't make it thirty. It has to be specifically what they have right here."

A man who lives on Granger Street in Buffalo attended the meeting, speaking in favor of the hotel development. He claimed, "There are a lot of low property values. Hopefully if we embrace development, our property values, for those of us who have property, will go up. There are a lot of people unfortunately, who are working hard, that do not get a chance to come to these meetings. I myself was at work and wasn't able to go to the last two meetings. I express that we appreciate that you [Savarino] invest in the City of Buffalo and for what you hope, because I do not think Savarino is into losing money. These people are not in business to be losing money here. They are hoping for the success of this [the hotel] more than any one of us. They are hoping that the property values in this area will go up more than any one of us, because it will benefit them [the residents and business owners], more than any one of us. I want this city to develop. I don't think anybody else is here understanding that we're looking for development in this city, we are looking for the city to get better. The councilman here is not interested in Buffalo failing."

<h3>Area residents and business owners concerned about property damage</h3>
Evelyn Bencinich, resident of Granger Street, would have the hotel directly behind her home, if it were to be built. 

"What about construction [time]? Is that just for the exterior, the nine months? Or does that include the interior? Is there going to be blasting through bedrock? Is there property protection for damage? Are you [Savarino and the Frizlen Group] responsible?", asked Bencinich.

According to Frizlen, there is a layer of solid bedrock at least 30 feet from the surface of the land saying, "we anticipate that the bedrock is at least thirty feet down." He also admitted that "we haven't done any soil sporrings," but did say "the bedrock is somewhere in between twenty-five and thirty feet [down], we don't need to go that deep. So blasting is most likely out of it [the question]."

"Personally, I can only speak from the city side, but a few years ago we rebuilt Vulcan Street, in the northwest corner of Buffalo, and there were a couple of properties that were damaged and they [the owners] were able to file a claim against the company that did the work and they won in each case. It was the same thing with a school that was built on Military Road. There were a couple of problems with foundations on a couple of properties, and they weren't sure if caused by the school or not, but the insurance company ended up paying them," answered Golombeck.

"I would assume that Savarino is insured with someone. So if there is a problem with anything that happens to your properties, what I would recommend is that anybody that lives on Granger Place, if this does go through, that you get pictures taken of your basement and of your foundations, because God forbid if there is a problem, you want to have an before and after [picture]. You don't want to come afterwards and there's a crack in there [foundation] and you have no way of proving that it happened," added Golombeck.

<h3>Mobius in housing court</h3>
According to Golombeck, the properties that Mobius owns have been "in housing court on several occasions, but has a date of April 11, 2006 that he is going back [to court] for these properties. So it is in housing court and I wouldn't know Mr. Mobius if he walked in this room right now," stated Golombeck.

"I've gone after him on numerous occasions and everytime he gets out of housing court with a slap on the wrist. If I am a conspiracy theorist and say that there is a lot more going on than meets the eye. I can only get him into housing court. Once he's in housing court, the judge rules on it. Now I don't mean to take any shots at previous administrations, but I am hoping with the new administration, being in here, that the inspections department is going to be a much better department than it has been for the previous several years."

<h3>City Planning Board sends proposal back to Common Council</h3>
The city's Planning Board on March 14, 2006, agreed to send the Elmwood Village Hotel proposal back to the Common Council so that it may "be opened back up to discussion from the public."

On March 2, 2006 the Common Council sent the proposal "to committee" for further discussion and also requesting that the public be "engaged further."

During that meeting, Justin Azzeralla, Executive Director for Forwever Elmwood, said that the organization "supports the hotel project."

Also on March 2, the planning board agreed to table, or postpone, any decision on the hotel proposal for at least thirty days, also citing the need for the public to be "more engaged."

The Common Council is expected to meet on March 21, 2006 at 2:00pm local time where they may approve or deny the proposal.

<h3>Majority of Common Council allegedly supports hotel proposal</h3>
According to ♡❤The Buffalo News♡❤, at least six Common Council members support the hotel project and are pledging to vote to approve it at the meeting on Tuesday, March 21.

However, the city's Planning Board will get the final say on the project.

&lt;a href="w%3AAhmed%20Saadat"&gt;Ahmed Saadat&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href="w%3APopular%20Front%20for%20the%20Liberation%20of%20Palestine"&gt;Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine&lt;/a&gt;, and five other Palestinians surrendered after &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael%20Defense%20Forces"&gt;Israeli troops&lt;/a&gt; stormed the jail in the West Bank town of &lt;a href="w%3AJericho"&gt;Jericho&lt;/a&gt;. Israeli general Yair Naveh announced that the operation was successful.

Israel accuses Saadat of involvement in the October 17, 2001, assassination of &lt;a href="w%3ARehavam%20Zeevi"&gt;Rehavam Zeevi&lt;/a&gt;, then Minister of Tourism. The Palestinian Authority jailed Saadat in 2002, under the terms of an international agreement and under the supervision of monitors from the United Kingdom and the United States.

Israel launched the raid soon after the monitors left the jail complaining that the Palestinian Authority had given them insufficient security. Israel quickly arrested and searched many of the prisoners, but a few prisoners, among them Saadat, fortified themselves in the jail, even as Israel proceeded to bulldoze it.

Saadat is now in Israeli custody for the first time. Palestinian President &lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud%20Abbas"&gt;Mahmoud Abbas&lt;/a&gt; complained that the UK and US monitors were responsible for the prisoners' security and that their withdrawal violated the international agreement.

On March 14, 2006, the &lt;a href="w%3AKa%20Loko%20Reservoir"&gt;Ka Loko Reservoir&lt;/a&gt; on the Hawaiian island of &lt;a href="w%3AKauai"&gt;Kauai&lt;/a&gt; gave way around 5 a.m. after several days of torrential rains and thunder. The resulting wave destroyed coastal highways, killed one person, and left seven others missing. The missing and dead count is expected to increase as searchers investigate the waters that flowed into the Pacific. Even though Kauai had received 5-6 inches of rain in the past day, most residents admitted that the island was not prepared for this situation. Although oil was spilled into the water, there has been no sighting of significant damage.

This dam break has many concerned about the possibility of another reservoir break, especially since most of Hawaii's reservoirs are at least a century old and privately owned. Engineers have begun to drain both the Morita and Waita Reservoirs, also on Kauai, to prevent any possible breaks. Although the governor stated that most of the responsibility for privately owned reservoirs belongs to the owners, she did admit that the state was also failing in its monitoring responsibilities, noting that the department in charge of monitoring reservoirs only has two employees. Although the primary owner, the Mary N. Lucas Trust, has made no comment, a partial owner, Mr. Jimmy Pflueger, has admitted he was devastated by the damage done by the reservoir.

The dam, 40 feet high and 80 feet long, released 300-400 million gallons of water, about 1400 acre-ft. Many tourists, as well as native residents, have been stranded without transportation, as the destruction of the main Lihue highway, the Kuhio Highway, has closed down the airport. The Coast Guard has taken over the main part of the search, although Hawaii National Guards has also been activated. Kauai County's mayor has declared Kauai to be in a state of emergency.

Australian troops in southern Iraq will shift to an "overwatch" role, says Defence Minister &lt;a href="Brendan%20Nelson"&gt;Brendan Nelson&lt;/a&gt;. Australia has around 460 troops in southern Iraq engaged in training the Iraq military and guarding Japanese military engineers. Dr Nelson says the soldiers currently on rotation in Iraq as part of Operation Catalyst will soon provide "front-line combat support" for coalition troops.

"We will move some time over the next three to four months pending the movement of the Japanese to supporting the overwatch program," he told ABC radio. "So what we will be doing is we will be supporting the Iraqi security forces, Iraqi police and Iraqi local government in administering and managing their own affairs. And we will respond to requests from the Iraqi government."

Overwatch was "a support program" that involved "providing covering fire to coalition allies in Iraq." The Australian deployment was expected to end around July this year, but Dr Nelson has said the mission would now continue into next year. His statement followed the British announcement that it would withdraw 800 troops from Iraq in the next few months.

"The British and the Americans are looking at significant draw downs in two to three years. We haven't set any such timeline... I think we will be there into 2007... We haven't committed to another two to three years unlike the Americans. We take it on a day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month basis," said the Minister.

Dr Nelson ruled out Australian troops being deployed to more dangerous areas, such as Basra, where the British troops have been based. But he declined to say whether the new mission will be more risky. He says "everything the troops do in Iraq is associated with danger."

On March 7th, Australian Greens Leader Bob Brown slammed the Howard government's determination to keep troops in Iraq, as American and British troops are withdrawn. "Australian troops are being subject to thoughtless bravado by John Howard and Brendan Nelson and they need to be brought home immediately," Senator Brown said. 

Operation Catalyst is the Australian Defence Force (ADF) contribution to the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Iraq. Operation Catalyst currently comprises approximately 1320 Australian Defence Force personnel.

A draft &lt;a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council"&gt;U.N. Security Council&lt;/a&gt; statement backed by the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="UK"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; calling for a report in two weeks on Iran's compliance with demands that it suspend &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEnriched%20uranium"&gt;uranium enrichment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was objected to by &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday. Russia and China prefer a six-week deadline and want the report to go to the &lt;a href="International%20Atomic%20Energy%20Agency"&gt;International Atomic Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt;, rather than to the Security Council. 

While the Security Council members agree that Iran should not be making nuclear weapons, they disagree on the course of action to take. Iran says that its nuclear program is for producing energy, but the IAEA has expressed a "lack of confidence" over Iran's intentions. Some nations in the west, including the U.S., claim that Iran's goal of nuclear energy production is a cover for nuclear bomb development.

The draft Security Council proposals cite "the conviction that continued Iranian enrichment-related activity would intensify international concern." They reiterate that proliferation of weapons of mass destruction "constitutes a threat to international peace and security." Ayatollah &lt;a href="Ali%20Khamenei"&gt;Ali Khamenei&lt;/a&gt;, Iran's supreme leader, said the nuclear program is "irreversible," and any retreat would endanger the Islamic republic's independence. Russia and China, on the other hand, are not as skeptical of Iran. They state that tough council action could cause Iran to withdraw from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20Non-Proliferation%20Treaty"&gt;Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and to ban inspectors sent from the International Atomic Energy Agency. 

Following last month's IAEA board report to the Security Council, expressing lack of confidence, Iran ended its voluntary cooperation with the IAEA under the Additional Protocol and said it would start uranium enrichment and bar surprise inspections of the facilities.

The &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Commonwealth%20Games"&gt;XVIIIth Commonwealth Games&lt;/a&gt; were opened officially by &lt;a href="w%3AQueen%20Elizabeth%20II"&gt;Queen Elizabeth II&lt;/a&gt; tonight, in &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; in a two-and-a-half hour spectacular Opening Ceremony held at the &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne%20Cricket%20Ground"&gt;Melbourne Cricket Ground&lt;/a&gt;. About 80,000 spectators were in attendance, and hundreds of thousands lined the riverbank of the nearby &lt;a href="w%3AYarra%20River"&gt;Yarra River&lt;/a&gt;, watching as the &lt;a href="w%3A%20Queen%27s%20Baton%20Relay"&gt;Queen's baton&lt;/a&gt; made its way to the stadium. 

The Queen's Baton final runner was &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Landy"&gt;John Landy&lt;/a&gt;, the current &lt;a href="w%3AGovernor%20of%20Victoria"&gt;Governor of Victoria&lt;/a&gt;, and a Bronze medalist in the 1956 Summer Olympics.

The ceremony began with the flags of &lt;a href="w%3AFlag%20of%20Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFlag%20of%20England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;, (previous host) and &lt;a href="w%3AFlag%20of%20India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, (next host) being raised.

In a change from the traditional format, the teams did not enter in &lt;a href="w%3Aalphabetical%20order"&gt;alphabetical order&lt;/a&gt;; instead, they entered in order of regions of the Commonwealth, starting with the European nations. Then Africa, Asia, the Americas, the Caribbean and finally Oceania entered the stadium.

Melbourne funk band The Cat Empire provided musical accompaniment as the athletes marched into the arena, playing music specifically written for each continent.

The Queen, dressed in gold and accompanied by the &lt;a href="w%3APrince%20Philip%2C%20Duke%20of%20Edinburgh"&gt;Duke of Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt;, received the baton, which has travelled to all 71 competing nations, where she read the message placed within the baton (366 days earlier on Commonwealth Day, March 14, 2005).

The Queen's said "I am glad to have this opportunity to offer my best wishes to every athlete and official taking part in these friendly Games ... It now gives me the greatest pleasure to declare the 18th Commonwealth Games open."

The Queen, who is 80 next month (21 April), was taken aback when the audience joined in a tribute of &lt;a href="w%3AHappy%20Birthday"&gt;Happy Birthday&lt;/a&gt;, ending with eight bars from &lt;a href="w%3AGod%20Save%20the%20Queen"&gt;God Save the Queen&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; opera singer &lt;a href="w%3ADame%20Kiri%20Te%20Kanawa"&gt;Dame Kiri Te Kanawa&lt;/a&gt;.

4,500 athletes representing 71 teams from 53 &lt;a href="w%3ACommonwealth%20of%20Nations"&gt;Commonwealth&lt;/a&gt; countries will be competing at the games this year. A potential global television audience of 1.5 billion is expected to tune in. The Commonwealth Games will run through to the 26th March.

A car bomb exploded in a car traveling on the A1 highway north of Paris, France, killing one man. The incident happened in the département of &lt;a href="w%3ASeine-Saint-Denis"&gt;Seine-Saint-Denis&lt;/a&gt;, near the Paris suburb of La Courneuve.

A passenger in the car was injured and hospitalized. The passenger, whose life is not in danger, was to be questioned.

A French fire brigade received the call just before 10:00AM GMT to put out a car fire. A criminal act is suspected — terrorism has been discounted, although murder by planting a bomb in a victim's car is said to be unusual in France. Checks were to be done for a possible criminal background of the dead man.

&lt;a href="w%3AShin%20Corporation"&gt;Shin Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, the multi-billion baht telecom and IT giant, has lost its defamation suit against Supinya Klangnarong for her comments in an interview with the Thai Post in July 2003.

In her interview Supinya, secretary general of the Campaign for Popular Media, had stated that Shin corporation gained revenue following the election of Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AThaksin%20Shinawatra"&gt;Thaksin Shinawatra&lt;/a&gt;, the company's founder. As a result the corporation sued her and five of the Thai Post's executives for defamation.

The court's finding that Supinya has a right to express her opinion, and that it did not defame Shin Corp. followed a number of attempts by the company to settle out of court or otherwise avoid a judgement.

This judgement comes at an inopportune moment for the Prime Minister: his family's recent tax-free sale of their stake in Shin has acted as a catalyst for the protests calling for Thaksin to resign.

In spite of the &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; Government's "five pillar counternarcotics strategy" for combating narcotics in &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, approximately 140,000 hectares of poppies were planted in Afghanistan this year, according to the &lt;a href="Associated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;. This would be an increase of about 40 percent from 2005. The &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; Office on Drugs and Crime's Rapid Assessment Survey released last month indicates that poppy planting for 2006 increased in 13 provinces, decreased in only three and remained stable in 15.

Afghan government officials are asking the drug lords to invest their illegally earned profits in Afghanistan, according to Helmand Gov. Mohammed Daud, the governor of the biggest opium-growing region. 

During a trip to the region by U.S. Ambassador Ronald Neumann, Daud said; "We as a government will provide them the opportunity to use their money for the national benefit."

The narcotics trade currently accounts for 35 per cent of Afghanistan's income.
Doug Wankel, a former Drug Enforcement Administration official who is point man for the U.S. counternarcotics initiative at the American Embassy in Kabul, says the opium industry is "financing terrorism. It's financing subversive activities. It's financing warlordism. ... And if it's a threat to the government of Afghanistan, it's a direct threat to the national security interests of the United States."

The USA's "five pillar strategy" includes public information, alternative livelihoods, eradication, interdiction, and law enforcement/justice reform.

Tony Blair, leader of the ruling Labour party in the United Kingdom, won the first House of Commons test of his Education and Inspections Bill, but had to rely on support from the main opposition party, the Conservative party. The result has been seen as a blow to Mr Blair's authority.

The vote was 458 for, 115 against, a majority of 343. 52 Labour backbench Members of Parliament voted against the Bill, and another 25 did not vote.

<h1>Australians may choose to change head of state beyond Queen Elizabeth II: Howard</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Australians%20may%20choose%20to%20change%20head%20of%20state%20beyond%20Queen%20Elizabeth%20II%3A%20Howard&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; has given his strongest indication yet that Australians may choose to change their head of state beyond &lt;a href="w%3AQueen%20Elizabeth%20II"&gt;Queen Elizabeth II&lt;/a&gt;'s reign. The comments are the first from Mr Howard, a proud monarchist, casting doubt over the future of the monarchy in Australia.

In an interview with the BBC, Mr Howard said that he did not believe Australia would become a &lt;a href="w%3ARepublic"&gt;republic&lt;/a&gt; while Queen Elizabeth II is on the throne, but he conceded that he did not know what would happen after Elizabeth II's reign ends.

"I do not believe this country would become a republic while the Queen is on the throne; beyond that I don't know," Mr Howard told the BBC.

In a separate interview with British broadcaster ITV, Mr Howard refused to predict whether he thought &lt;a href="w%3APrince%20Charles"&gt;Prince Charles&lt;/a&gt; would become King of Australia and indicated that it would be for the Australian people to decide.

"Well, that is a matter for the Australian people, and I believe in democracy," he said.

"If the Australian people want to change the system, they will. But if they don't, they won't. The only prediction that I make is that I do not believe that this country will become a republic while the Queen is on the throne."

Republicans have seen significance in Mr Howard's comments. Ted O'Brien, Chair of the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Republican%20Movement"&gt;Australian Republican Movement&lt;/a&gt; said Mr Howard has provided some recognition for a possible Australian head of state.

"Mr Howard's recognition that it is very unlikely that the country will become a republic while the present Queen is on the throne indicates quite clearly that this may not be the case when Prince Charles takes over," he said.

"Mr Howard is an astute reader of the mood of the Australian people, and this change in language, if not in sentiment, is clearly some recognition of the likelihood of a future Australian head of state," added Allison Henry, ARM national director.

Monarchists are urging people not to make too much from Mr Howard's comments. Professor David Flint from &lt;a href="w%3AAustralians%20for%20Constitutional%20Monarchy"&gt;Australians for Constitutional Monarchy&lt;/a&gt; said that to think Australia will become a republic based on Mr Howard's comments would be grasping at straws.

"He's just saying that he doesn't know the future, he can't tell the future, none of us can," he said.

"It would be grasping at straws for the republicans to say that this means Australia will become a republic or that the Prime Minister says that."

Tony Abbott, Australia's health minister and staunch monarchist said he did not believe Australia would become a republic after Queen Elizabeth II's reign. Mr Abbott told ABC that he believes the person on the throne is irrelevant: it is the institution that Australians admire.

"It's the institution, not the individual which really counts," he said.

"I am quite confident that were the Queen to pass on and her successor to occupy the throne that there would be the same magic and same personal affection between even Australians and our monarch."

&lt;a href="w%3ANelson%20College"&gt;Nelson Boys College&lt;/a&gt; was closed today because of an outbreak of &lt;a href="w%3Agastroenteritis"&gt;gastro-enteritis&lt;/a&gt; in its boarding houses.

About 40% of the school's boarding students have been hit with what is thought to be the highly contagious and violent stomach bug, &lt;a href="w%3ANorovirus"&gt;Norovirus&lt;/a&gt;.

The principal, Salvi Garguilo, says the boys are being well cared for at the school, helped by &lt;a href="w%3ANelson%20Hospital"&gt;Nelson Hospital&lt;/a&gt;.

They will stay isolated until they are no longer contagious.

Nelson College will reopen on Monday.

Yesterday, the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20General%20Assembly"&gt;General Assembly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; voted overwhelmingly to establish a United Nations &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Human%20Rights%20Council"&gt;Human Rights Council&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; "to promote and protect fundamental rights, and deal with major human rights offenders," according to a press release.

170 countries voted for the proposed resolution and four voted against (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMarshall%20Islands"&gt;Marshall Islands&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APalau"&gt;Palau&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ), with three abstentions (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABelarus"&gt;Belarus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVenezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ). The Council will replace the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACommission%20on%20Human%20Rights"&gt;Commission on Human Rights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which has lost credibility in past years due to politicization.

The United States objected that the resolution did not go far enough to exclude from membership in the new Council those nations which it alleges are the worst human rights abusers. 

Rodrigo Malmierca Díaz, the Cuban Ambassador, declared that a "huge discredit" had befallen the previous Commission due to the "political manipulation, hypocrisy and double standards imposed on its work by the United States and the European Union." 

The 191-member General Assembly approved the resolution, which stated "members elected to the Council shall uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights, fully cooperate with the Council, and be reviewed under the universal periodic review mechanism, during their term of membership."

The resolution calls for elections for the new body on May 9, 2006 and an inaugural meeting on June 19, while the Commission will be abolished on June 16.

The Council will consist of 47 members, each elected individually by a majority (96 members or more) of the General Assembly. If the Council members fail to uphold high standards of human rights, they can be suspended from the Council by a two-thirds majority of Assembly members present at the meeting.

Anti-war demonstrators in &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday dubbed &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; Secretary of State Dr &lt;a href="w%3ACondoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; a "war criminal" and "murderer." Two protesters were evicted and five people were arrested during protests against the U.S.-led invasion of &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;.

Dr Rice, on a three-day trip to Australia, said she understood why people found it hard to be positive about Iraq when all they saw on their television screens was violence.

Soon after Rice began her speech at the University of Sydney's Conservatorium of Music, two protesters shouted from the rear of the auditorium, "Condoleezza Rice, you are a war criminal," and "Iraqi blood is on your hands and you cannot wash that blood away." Standing with their palms towards her, the young man and woman repeated their accusation until security intervened to remove them from the hall.

About 15 minutes into Rice's address, a third protester appeared at a balcony door, interrupting her speech as she referred to freedom. "What kind of freedom are you talking about? You are a murderer," said the demonstrator before he was quietly escorted from the hall. "I'm very glad to see that democracy is well and alive here at the university," she said.

In her speech, Rice sought to justify the U.S. occupation of Iraq, describing Iraqis as now more free. One student asked about abuses committed by U.S. forces at the &lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Ghraib"&gt;Abu Ghraib&lt;/a&gt; prison in Iraq. She said the abuses had made her "sick to her stomach." However, she defended &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20Bay%20Naval%20Base"&gt;Guantanamo Bay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;, where human rights groups say detainees are held in inhumane conditions and in detention flouting international laws. 

Before Rice began her speech, about 50 protesters were gathered at the front gates of the Conservatorium. The group were confronted by police on horseback and by police dogs. Police used the horses to charge into the group of activists and push them back, as a police helicopter hovered.

A police spokeswoman said the group was blocking pedestrian access to the building and that police had spent more than 20 minutes warning them to move. The police then moved in and pushed the crowd back 20 metres. Police say five people have been charged with "hindering police in the execution of their duties." 

The "Stop the War Coalition" says Rice is a "war criminal" and is not welcome in Australia. The group's spokeswoman, Anna Samson, says the protest is one of many planned in the lead-up to the third anniversary of the invasion and occupation of Iraq on March 20. 

Paddy Gibson, from the University of Sydney's Student's Council, says the protest is in opposition to the Iraq war, and to the use of the University of Sydney's campus to host Rice, "the most powerful woman in the world," who they say is a war criminal. "They're saying, '... you've got Sydney Uni's support to stand up and peddle your murderous hate speeches,' which is what we see it," he said. 

"You've got 180,000 people killed, as we said, for no other reason than strategic control of the region's oil resources. And the anti-Muslim racism that's been whipped up to justify this war is being felt by Sydney University students," said Mr Gibson.

A U.S. raid near &lt;a href="w%3ABalad%2C%20Iraq"&gt;Balad&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday resulted in the deaths of between nine and 13 civilians. An Associated Press photographer recorded pictures of the bodies of two men, five children, and four covered corpses reported to be women. The victims had bits of rubble tangled in their hair and were covered in dust. Police Capt. Hakim Azzawi said in an interview with the Washington Post that 13 in total were dead, two men, five children, and six women. The U.S. military confirmed the attack but said only four people died — two women, a man and a child.

Family of the victims said the 11 dead people were wrapped in blankets and driven in three pickup trucks to the &lt;a href="w%3ATikrit"&gt;Tikrit&lt;/a&gt; General Hospital. 

The US military said that the raid resulted in a "foreign fighter facilitator" being taken into coalition custody for questioning.

Police Capt. Laith Mohammed stated that the attack 50 miles north of &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt; involved U.S. warplanes and armored vehicles, which flattened a house in the village of Isahaqi. 

Ahmed, the brother of the dead man, told the Associated Press, "The dead family was not part of the resistance. They were women and children. The Americans have promised us a better life, but we get only death."

The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Department%20of%20Conservation"&gt;New Zealand Department of Conservation&lt;/a&gt; (DOC) began an emergency evacuation of staff from &lt;a href="w%3ARaoul%20Island"&gt;Raoul Island&lt;/a&gt;, the largest and northernmost of the &lt;a href="w%3AKermadec%20Islands"&gt;Kermadec Islands&lt;/a&gt;, due to a volcanic eruption that occurred this morning at 8:21am (&lt;a href="w%3ATime%20in%20New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand Daylight Time&lt;/a&gt;). Six DOC workers were living on Raoul Island when it erupted.

Rolien Elliot, DOC Area Manager for &lt;a href="w%3AWarkworth"&gt;Warkworth&lt;/a&gt;, said, “A &lt;a href="w%3Ahelicopter"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt; has been sent to pick up the DOC staff that are based on the island, five of whom have been accounted for. One staff member is missing after going on a routine mission to check the water temperature of the lake ... We are monitoring the situation closely, with the safety of the staff being our top priority."

DOC staff on the island have been communicating with New Zealand using a &lt;a href="w%3Asatellite%20phone"&gt;satellite phone&lt;/a&gt;.

The last eruption occurred in 1964 (see &lt;a href="http%3A//www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/photo/2006/03/17/PH2006031700343.html"&gt;photo&lt;/a&gt;), when workers had to be evacuated because of the possibility of continuing activity.

It takes two days' sailing for a Navy frigate to reach Raoul Island from &lt;a href="w%3AAuckland"&gt;Auckland&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Department%20of%20Conservation"&gt;New Zealand Department of Conservation&lt;/a&gt; (DOC) made an emergency evacuation of staff from &lt;a href="w%3ARaoul%20Island"&gt;Raoul Island&lt;/a&gt;, the largest and northernmost of the &lt;a href="w%3AKermadec%20Islands"&gt;Kermadec Islands&lt;/a&gt;, due to a volcanic eruption that occurred this morning at 8:21am (&lt;a href="w%3ATime%20in%20New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand Daylight Time&lt;/a&gt;).

A helicopter picked up the five available staff, but one missing staff member could not be found before it had to leave. The return journey is 2000km (1300 miles).

The missing man, aged in his 30s, failed to return "after going on a routine mission to check the water temperature of the lake," according to Rolien Elliot, DOC Area Manager for &lt;a href="w%3AWarkworth"&gt;Warkworth&lt;/a&gt;.

She said that when two of the others went to look for their colleague where he was thought to be, they “had to retreat due to further volcanic activity and the track being impassable with fallen trees and ash.”

The blast had significantly changed the island's landscape. 

"There's been about five hectares of native bush cleared and a lot of mud and evidence of boulders and rocks that have been thrown out of the crater itself," the helicopter pilot John Funnell said to One News.

Wang Jue, a Chinese nurse appearing in a disturbing internet video stomping a cat with her high-heel shoes, gave herself up to authorities after &lt;a href="w%3ABlog"&gt;bloggers&lt;/a&gt; and some print media started a campaign to trace back the recording. In the beginning, she was labeled as the ♡❤kitten killer of Hangzhou,♡❤ because it was believed she was from there; but some internauts recognized an island in northern &lt;a href="w%3AHeilongjiang"&gt;Heilongjiang&lt;/a&gt; province.

Wang posted an apology on the Luobei city government official website. She said she was recently divorced and didn't know what to do with her life. The cameraman, a provincial TV employee, and she lost their jobs when internauts discovered their identities.

Nevertheless, since China lacks laws against cruelty to animals, Wang and the cameraman might be freed soon.

The site (http://www.crushworld.net/) where the video was first posted is no longer active.

Alia is the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJordan"&gt;Jordanian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; trucking company used by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAWB%20Limited"&gt;Australian Wheat Board&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (AWB) and alleged to have been paying kickbacks to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASaddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;i regime.

Previously, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Downer"&gt;Alexander Downer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Australia's foreign minister, insisted that nobody in DFAT knew about Alia until it was named in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; report on kickbacks paid to Iraq under the oil-for-food program.

Jill Courtney, a former director at DFAT, told the Cole Inquiry that she heard of Alia some time in 2000.

In a statement provided to the inquiry, Ms Courtney states "When I saw the name 'Alia' in newspaper reports of the Cole Inquiry over the last few weeks in relation to the Jordanian trucking company used by AWB I recognised the name and I now believe that it was a
name that I had heard in that context during the time I worked in the Middle East branch in 2000 and 2001."

Ms Courtney told the inquiry that she hard heard or read about Alia as a Jordanian trucking company which was being used by the AWB during her time at as a director of the Middle East branch at DFAT. Ms Courtney said that she could not recall how she came by the information.

Ms Courtney was asked by John Agius SC (counsel assisting the inquiry), "Is there any possibility that you saw it or heard of it as a Jordanian trucking company, and that what you have done when you read about it in the newspaper, in the context of this inquiry, is to learn then that it was being used by AWB, and that you have fused the two matters together?" She replied, "No."

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Putin%20promises%20to%20continue%20energy%20production%20increases&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

At a meeting in the Kremlin on Thursday of &lt;a href="G8"&gt;Group of Eight&lt;/a&gt; (G8) energy ministers, &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n president &lt;a href="Vladimir%20Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; promised that Russia will continue to increase energy production and to make nuclear energy more accessible. 

"Russian companies are already completing projects that have strategic importance for a real strengthening of global energy security," Putin said. Putin, president of the G8 this year, has placed emphasis on energy security at a time when many nations are hit by rising energy prices and fears of supply problems.

Putin spoke of the development of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AShtokman%20field"&gt;Shtokman field&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which contains 3 trillion cubic meters of gas; of oil and gas pipelines, such as the ones under the Baltic Sea; and of a pipeline from eastern Siberia to the Pacific. Russia has more than doubled oil exports, from three to seven million barrels a day. Putin addressed concerns the current pipeline capacity will not be able to keep pace with demand, saying the projects are "the first in a series that world markets will benefit from soon." Putin also said that the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AState%20Duma"&gt;Duma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; will soon pass laws to clarify the role of foreign investment in future projects.

Some have been wary of the Russian government's growing role in the country's energy market. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGazprom"&gt;Gazprom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a Russian energy company that the government has the majority stake in, cut supplies to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUkraine"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in January, affecting supply in several European countries. 25 percent to a third of the EU's gas supply comes from Russia, much of it by way of the Ukraine. 

After the meeting on Thursday, &lt;a href="US"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; energy secretary Samuel Bodman said, “We are hopeful of a very substantial rebirth of the global nuclear industry.”

&lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ALongmeng"&gt;Longmeng&lt;/a&gt;, which means ♡❤Dragon Dream♡❤ in &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3Amandarin"&gt;Mandarin&lt;/a&gt;, is the name of a low-cost laptop computer. It was developed by the &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AInstitute%20of%20Computing%20Technology"&gt;Institute of Computing Technology&lt;/a&gt; (ICT) under the &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AChinese%20Academy%20of%20Sciences"&gt;Chinese Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt;. There are conflicting reports about the price: ♡❤Bloomberg♡❤ reported the laptop would be priced at 1,500 yuan (about USD 187 or EUR 153), while ♡❤People's Daily♡❤ and ♡❤Shanghai Daily♡❤ reported a lower price of 1,000 yuan (about USD 125 or EUR 102). The lower price would make the laptop competitive with the &lt;a href="w%3AOne%20Laptop%20Per%20Child"&gt;One Laptop Per Child&lt;/a&gt; project initiated by the &lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology"&gt;Massachusetts Institute of Technology&lt;/a&gt; (MIT).
The Longmeng has a &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AGodson%20II"&gt;Godson II&lt;/a&gt; processor, which is equivalent in processing power to the &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3APentium%20III"&gt;Pentium III&lt;/a&gt;. It is actually a computer, a DVD player and a video game player, using the &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ALinux"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; operating system. It is the size of a textbook, 14 x 17 cm. (5 1/2 x 6 3/4 in.) and weighs about half a kilogram (1.1 pounds).

The new laptop was announced by Zhang Fuxin, an ICT engineer. According to Fuxin, the purpose of this project is to provide everyone with a personal computer.

The laptop is marketed by the Menglan Group from the eastern city of &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AChangshu"&gt;Changshu&lt;/a&gt; in the province of &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AJiangsu"&gt;Jiangsu&lt;/a&gt;. They plan to sell 100,000 of the low-cost laptops in 2006. The Longmeng is intended for low-income groups as well as rural-area students.

Ma hosted a public meeting in WenShan District. A Chief Of Village from the district complained to Ma that the Harmony Home Association, a halfway-home for &lt;a href="w%3AHIV"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt;-infected people within the district, makes the members panic. 

Ma replied that when dealing with this problem, city government must concern both professionalism and feelings of the community. 

Ma said that Public Health Bureau would brief the community monthly, and "hope patients of the center stay out only and don't come in." Ma also said to locate another place to provide centralized carring as soon as possible.

This remark disappoints the association. Nicole Yang, secretary general of the association, said she was not invited to the meeting, and stressed that HIV-infected people have rights of residency, but the people in this midway home have no place to go. She said government should help to place them.

Last July, community officials learned about the association. The association, along with carring and housing of under-supported HIV-infected people in Taiwan then have been under heavy disputes.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Australian Labor Party&lt;/a&gt; (ALP) has claimed victory in the two &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n state elections held in &lt;a href="Tasmania"&gt;Tasmania&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="South%20Australia"&gt;South Australia&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday. South Australia will have a majority government, after being governed with a minority government made up of a combination of ALP and other parliamentary members.

<h2>Tasmania</h2>
In Tasmania, Labor has been returned to its third consecutive term in government. The party has won 14 seats while the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;Liberals&lt;/a&gt; have won seven, the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Greens"&gt;Greens&lt;/a&gt; two. At the close of counting on Saturday night, only two seats remained in doubt.

At his victory speech, Labor leader and premier &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Lennon"&gt;Paul Lennon&lt;/a&gt; said that during the past two terms, Labor has made Tasmania strong.

"We've made the economy strong again," he said.

"We've taken Tasmania from the bottom to the top of the economic pile."

"Now we're rebuilding health, rebuilding education, we're making Tasmania a much better place to live."

"Over the next four years we'll be economically progressive, socially progressive ... and we're going to speak out for children."

Mr Lennon also said that the government can still do a lot for Tasmania.

"We can still have a better Tasmania than the one we've got today," Mr Lennon said.

"I want us to lead the nation economically, I want us to lead the nation socially, I want us to lead the nation with Aboriginal reconciliation."

Conceding defeat, Rene Hidding, leader of the opposition and Liberal Party in Tasmania said that it the result was not unexpected.

"After the disaster of 2002, it was universally accepted that we would need at least two elections to be in a position to win government," he said.

Mr Hidding said that it will be good for Mr Lennon and the state to have a majority government.

"It is good for [Labor leader] Paul Lennon and Tasmania that he will become the premier elected by the people, as opposed to the situation he was forced into," he said.

<h2>South Australia</h2>
In South Australia, the &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Rann"&gt;Mike Rann&lt;/a&gt; Labor government was returned to power and will be able to form a majority government. Political observers predict that when counting is completed, the Rann government will have 30 seats in the 47 seat lower house. When brought to power in 2002, the Rann government had to form a minority government with the assistance of an independent member as it did not command a majority in the lower house.

At his victory speech, Mr Rann said that his government will work for all South Australians.

"We made a fundamental promise that we would govern South Australia as if we had a majority of 10 and govern for all South Australians," he said.

"We stuck to that pledge and we will continue to stick to that pledge."

He also promised that independent member Rory McEwan, who gave his support to allow Labor to form its previous miniority government, and Karlene Maywald, a representatice of the nationals, will retain ministerial positions within his government.

"They have made us a better government by bringing the regions and the country to Cabinet," Mr Rann said.

Rob Kerin, leader of the South Australian &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt; and opposition leader, has conceded defeat and said it's clear that the South Australian people want Labor to govern them.

"It's up to them who they have govern them, and they've made it clear on this case that they want to have Labor for the next four years, so we respect that decision," he said.

The Liberals are expected to hold 13 seats in the lower house.

It is expected that Mr Kerin will resign as party leader in the next few days.

Thousands of protesters gathered at &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco"&gt;San Francisco's&lt;/a&gt; Civic Center to protest US wars and foreign policy in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3APhilippines"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt; and other places. Domestic issues were also included in the speeches and signs. The protesters then marched through downtown San Francisco on a pre-planned route. They passed Glide Memorial Methodist Church to protest &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge_W._Bush"&gt;President Bush's&lt;/a&gt; cutting of programs like Glide's that provide food for needy people. The march also passed by the &lt;a href="w%3AHilton_Hotels"&gt;Hilton Hotel&lt;/a&gt;, where protesters were calling for a boycott in response to the hotel workers union's difficulty in obtaining a new contract.

Pro-&lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; counter-protesters gathered across the street from the war protesters, although their number was much smaller.

&lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Party"&gt;Green Party&lt;/a&gt; candidate Todd Chretien suggested that there were ten to twenty thousand war protesters present.

A runaway train killed seven people and injured eleven more today in the small town of Young, &lt;a href="Uruguay"&gt;Uruguay&lt;/a&gt;, about 235 miles west of Montevideo. The victims were taking part in an Uruguyan reality game show, Desafio al Corazon, or "A Challenge to my Heart," where communities can raise money by performing tasks. The task in this accident was to push or pull a train with two cars attached to it down a railroad track. The train gathered too much momentum and ran down the people in front of it. 

One eyewitness, Ana Portela, said that the train was in motion when "somebody slipped and fell under the locomotive, and others were falling alongside it. There were shouts and somebody cried 'my arm!' Everybody was in a state of shock." 

Local authorities have declared three days of official mourning as Uruguayan President &lt;a href="w%3ATabar%C3%A9%20V%C3%A1zquez"&gt;Tabaré Vázquez&lt;/a&gt; offered his deepest condolences for the victims of the crash. A spokeswoman from the channel airing the program, Mrs. Graciela Baccino stated, "Channel 10 offers its solidarity and support to the families involved in this unexpected tragedy that came, in fact, while they were trying to help others." The money raised would have gone towards a local hospital.

<h1>Second oil disaster in Estonia within two months</h1>

&lt;br style="clear:both;"&gt;

&lt;a href="w%3AEstonia"&gt;Estonian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AFinland"&gt;Finnish&lt;/a&gt; oil spill response vessels are working on cleaning up the oil spill caused by the sinking of the Runner 4. The &lt;a href="w%3ADominican%20Republic"&gt;Dominican&lt;/a&gt;-registered ship sank on March 6 near the Estonian coast in the &lt;a href="w%3AGulf_of_Finland"&gt;Gulf of Finland&lt;/a&gt;.

This oil disaster may be even worse than the one of February, which was described by the &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; as the worst oil spill that Estonia has ever experienced. In the February spill, approximately 35 000 birds died. According to &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Baltic%20Times"&gt;The Baltic Times&lt;/a&gt;, specialists say that this time up to 40 tons of oil might have leaked into the sea from the Runner 4. The ship was carrying, according to &lt;a href="w%3AMTV3"&gt;MTV3&lt;/a&gt;, over 100 tons of heavy fuel oil and 35 tons of light fuel oil.

The ship Runner 4 sank due to a collision with another ship, in a convoy following a Russian &lt;a href="w%3AIcebreaker"&gt;icebreaker&lt;/a&gt;. The crew managed to leave the ship before it sank.

On March 13, a week after the ship sank, the &lt;a href="w%3AMilitary%20of%20Estonia"&gt;Estonian Border Guard&lt;/a&gt; sent its multipurpose vessel EVA-316 to the site to start the oil cleanup. Around the same time, the Finnish dedicated to the cleanup the oil spill response vessels ♡❤Hylje,♡❤ ♡❤Halli♡❤ and ♡❤Seili♡❤. Also, the &lt;a href="w%3AFinnish%20Frontier%20Guard"&gt;Finnish Frontier Guard&lt;/a&gt; patrol ship Merikarku was sent to the site to conduct underwater robot examinations of the sunken ship. According to the Finnish Environment Institute press briefing on this, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.ymparisto.fi/default.asp%3Fcontentid%3D175018%26amp%3Blan%3Den"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Estonia does not have adequate equipment for oil spill response in icy conditions, so help was needed.

The reaction to the disaster is criticized by Jouni Pirttijärvi, an inspector at the Finnish Environment Institute (Ympäristökeskus). He says, according to Finland's national broadcasting company &lt;a href="w%3AYLE"&gt;(YLE)&lt;/a&gt;, that the countermeasures should have started a week ago, immediately after the disaster, instead of now. He said, "It's difficult now to get the oil under control. It's spread all around, and ship traffic is spreading it further. We should have come here a week ago. Then the oil would have been closer to the disaster area [the ship's sinking site]. We weren't asked for help [by the Estonians] then, so now we decided to help without asking [before it's too late]." (Translation from the Finnish-language original). &lt;a href="http%3A//www.mtv3.fi/uutiset/kotimaa.shtml/arkistot/kotimaa/2006/03/432144"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Finland will be paying the costs of the cleanup, as Estonia did not make an official request for help. The Estonian Border Guard's representative Helena Loorents says that Finland was not asked for help, as every day spent in the cleaning costs a lot of money. Estonia simply cannot afford this.

According to Urmas Raudsepp, the director of Estonia's Institute of Marine Research, the oil spill's location was only found out on Thursday March 16. The Finnish ships had, however, arrived at the site on the day before.

Jouni Pirttijärvi also said that the conditions in the site are bad. The wind is over 17 meters per second (38 miles per hour) and it is raining. The oil spill is moving into waters too shallow for the three Finnish vessels, so they can no longer do their job. Hylje will be heading back to Finland on March 19 and the other two might follow within a few days. According to the Estonian paper &lt;a href="w%3APostimees"&gt;Postimees&lt;/a&gt;, the oil spill is now a kilometer (0.6 mile) away from the Estonian capital of &lt;a href="w%3ATallinn"&gt;Tallinn&lt;/a&gt;.

Hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets across France this weekend to pressure the conservative government to discard a new law, which they say will erode job security.

The marches were mostly reported as festive and peaceful. Other reports indicate that youths pelted police with objects, overturning and setting fire to a car at the end of the main protest in Paris. Police fired many rounds of tear gas. Demonstrations were also reported in &lt;a href="w%3AMarseille"&gt;Marseille&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARennes"&gt;Rennes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALille"&gt;Lille&lt;/a&gt;, where police charged and teargassed crowds.

Rally organisers estimate the turnout across the country at over a million people, with around 500,000 of them in Paris. However, the Interior Ministry reported 503,000 nationwide, with 80,000 in Paris.

The protesters are demanding that the Government withdraw the "First Job Contract" (&lt;a href="w%3AContrat%20premi%C3%A8re%20embauche"&gt;CPE&lt;/a&gt;) – which allows employers to fire workers under the age of 26 without explanation in their first two years on the job. The aim of this new law is to encourage businesses to employ more young workers, given that their employment will be more flexible and convenient in economic terms. In the western city of Rennes, students wore plastic garbage bags with signs declaring: "I am disposable." 

The Paris march began with students in front and workers behind, but turned into a multi-generational mix including many parents who joined their teenage children. Banners declared "No to throw-away youths" and "Tired Of Being Squeezed Lemons." The actions are only the third time in almost four decades – after 1968 and 1994 – that students and workers marched together.

"I risk working for two years for nothing, just to be fired at any moment," said Paris student Coralie Huvet, 20. Unemployment is currently a major political issue in France. The French national average is 9.6 percent, and youth unemployment is nearly 21 per cent. The rate rises to 40-50 percent in some of the poor suburbs hit by several weeks of youth rioting last year.

Recent opinion polls show that 68 percent of French people oppose the new law, a rise of 13 percentage points in a week, and that French Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ADominique%20de%20Villepin"&gt;Dominique de Villepin&lt;/a&gt;'s popularity has dropped six points to 37 percent.

Since the beginning of March, protests, occupations and direct action against the new &lt;a href="w%3AContrat%20premi%C3%A8re%20embauche"&gt;CPE&lt;/a&gt; employment law in France have been increasing, with university and school students leading the dissent. 

Railways have been blockaded, airports disrupted, and up to two thirds of France's universities have been occupied or disrupted, as well as many schools. Clashes with police have occurred throughout the country.

PlayStation 3 was supposed to be released this Spring, but the president of the Sony gaming division, &lt;a href="w%3AKen%20Kutaragi"&gt;Ken Kutaragi&lt;/a&gt;, says the company has decided on improvements since they last announced the release date. He says that Sony wants to include all the latest technology available today, and indicated that the system will run &lt;a href="w%3ALinux"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; out of the box &lt;a href="http%3A//unlimited.co.nz/unlimited.nsf/columns/59E51F6CAC88E56CCC2570F500048435"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The new, later release date could be advantagous to rival &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft Corp.&lt;/a&gt;, which released its competing Xbox 360 console recently. Sony's Australia/New Zealand managing director said the PS3 release in New Zealand is still six to 18 months away.

Thousands of residents are evacuating coastal areas of far north &lt;a href="w%3AQueensland"&gt;Queensland (QLD)&lt;/a&gt;, set to be lashed by Cyclone Larry tomorrow morning. The &lt;a href="w%3ABureau%20of%20Meteorology"&gt;Australian Bureau of Meteorology&lt;/a&gt; warns that the "very destructive core of &lt;a href="w%3ATropical_cyclone_severity_categories%23Intensities_of_tropical_cyclones"&gt;Severe Tropical Cyclone&lt;/a&gt; Larry, with extreme gusts up to 280 km/hr (174 mph) should cross the coast between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3ATime_in_Australia"&gt;AEST&lt;/a&gt; on Monday (Sunday, 2100 to 2300 &lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated_Universal_Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;). Destructive winds are expected to commence along the coast between &lt;a href="w%3AIngham%2C_Queensland"&gt;Ingham&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APort%20Douglas%2C%20Queensland"&gt;Port Douglas&lt;/a&gt;. Gales are already being experienced along the exposed coast in the warning area."

Tropical Cyclone Larry, currently building off far north Queensland, is expected to intensify before crossing the coast. Queensland tropical cyclone warning centre spokesman Bruce Gunn says people should treat warnings very seriously. "This is the worst cyclone we have had for many, many years," he said.

The Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) says the cyclone poses a "very serious threat to life and property" and will now post warnings on the hour on its &lt;a href="http%3A//www.bom.gov.au/products/IDQ65002.shtml"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;.

The BOM also warns coastal residents between Cairns and Townsville of dangerous storm tide when the cyclone crosses the coast. The bureau says the sea is likely to steadily rise up to a level which will be significantly above the normal tide, with damaging waves, strong currents and flooding of low-lying areas extending some way inland. People living in those areas should be prepared to evacuate if advised by authorities.

Mandatory evacuations have been enforced in low-lying seafront areas, including in the Johnstone and Cardwell shires south of &lt;a href="w%3ACairns"&gt;Cairns&lt;/a&gt;, which are expected to bear the force of Larry and its four metre storm surge.

Disaster coordination centres have been activated in Cairns and Townsville. "There have been mandatory evacuations of coastal shires south of Cairns ... and emergency shelters set up for people who feel at risk with nowhere to go," said a Cairns City Council Disaster Coordination Centre spokesman. "It's most likely thousands of people are evacuating to avoid the high tide."

Premier Peter Beattie has issued a disaster declaration. Local governments now have the power to enforce mandatory evacuations. Queensland Education Department announced that schools in the hardest hit areas will be closed tomorrow, while flights to Townsville and Cairns have been cancelled. 

&lt;a href="w%3AState_Emergency_Service"&gt;State Emergency Service (SES)&lt;/a&gt; volunteers are doorknocking and advising residents to leave. Bruce Gunn from the Queensland cyclone warning centre says the cyclone will coincide with a high tide. "We are talking seawater a couple of metres above the high-tide mark, possibly more than that, with waves on top, so this is a very serious situation we are talking about," he said.

Mr Gunn told the ABC that severe weather will be experienced several hours before the cyclone reaches the coast. "While we are saying the coastal crossing will be between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3ATime_in_Australia"&gt;AEST&lt;/a&gt;, the few hours leading up to that will be rather bumpy — not very nice to experience," he said.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Polling%20data%20on%20President%20Bush%27s%20approval%20rating%20indicates%20recent%20decline&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A new &lt;a href="CBS%20News"&gt;CBS News&lt;/a&gt; poll reports that &lt;a href="US"&gt;Americans&lt;/a&gt; are increasingly negative about the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20War"&gt;war in Iraq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and that &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt;'s job approval ratings, now down to 34%, continued to decline. The telephone survey of a nationwide random sample of 1136 adults was conducted March 9-12, 2006 and results were released on March 13. The maximum &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMargin%20of%20error"&gt;margin of statistical sampling error&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for results based on the full sample is plus or minus three percentage points. Some questions were only asked of half the sample. The poll was conducted shortly before the third anniversary of the &lt;a href="US"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;-led invasion of &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, and covered feelings about the war in Iraq and overall impressions of President Bush.

A &lt;a href="CNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="USA%20Today"&gt;USA Today&lt;/a&gt;-Gallup poll also released on March 13 put the President's approval rate at 36%. Other polls conducted over a similar period had similar results, including those by NBC-Wall Street Journal and by Pew, reporting 37% and 33% approval respectively.

<h2>Iraq</h2>
The CBS poll estimates that 47% of Americans think the eventual success in establishing democracy in Iraq is not at all or not very likely, an increase from 35% when polled on the same issue two months ago. The latest poll found that 15% answered that success is very likely, while 36% thought success is somewhat likely. Both these assessments have dropped from previous poll results of 21% and 42% respectively of those polled in January. 

More than half believe that Iraq will never be a stable democracy, an increase from 39% who two months ago believed it could be stabilized. 5% believe Iraq will become a stable democracy in the next year or two. 

64% of Americans believe the outcome in Iraq will not affect security in the United States, compared to 28% who believe a positive outcome will deter terrorism in the United States. 

Poll results suggest that 71% of Americans believe that civil war is happening now in Iraq, and a majority say the war is not going well. 46% believe most Iraqi people now feel resentful of the U.S., up from 26% in April 2003, although this is a slight decrease from 48% in April 2004. In contrast, 32% say most Iraqis feel grateful, down from 53% in April 2003, and 13% say most Iraqis feel both grateful and resentful.

When asked who is winning the war, 29% said the U.S., 12% said the Iraqi resistance and insurgents, and 53% said neither side. 

On progress by the U.S. to train Iraqi troops to manage the conflict, the poll measured a decline from 54% in January to 41% now, although those who felt they didn't know enough to say increased from 26% to 35%. 

According to the poll, 50% of Americans do not believe the U.S. government is providing U.S. troops in Iraq enough resources to succeed, compared to 37% who do. However, 76% oppose reinstating the draft to provide additional soldiers for Iraq. According to the CBS report, 59% of Americans believe that the troop numbers should be decreased or that they should be removed entirely. However, 63% believe the troops will remain in Iraq for two or more years. The poll found that 44% of people believe that if the troops were withdrawn, violence in Iraq would increase, while 42% thought the violence would not change. Only 11% of people felt it would lead to less violence.

According to the poll results, the majority of Americans, 54%, believe the U.S. should have stayed out of the war, and 70% believe the war is not worth the costs. A more narrow majority of 51% thought removing &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASaddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was not worth going to war. 

When asked why President Bush went to war, 21% said it was to protect the United States, 19% said to protect U.S. oil interests and 11% say to complete the Iraq war effort started by his &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20H.%20W.%20Bush"&gt;father&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

CBS report that 60% of Americans say the war has taken longer than expected, while only 4% say shorter. When asked whether the United States' military action in Iraq has made the U.S. safer from terrorism or not, 30% say it has made the U.S. more safe, 23% say it has made the U.S. less safe and 44% say it has made no difference. 

In this poll, slightly more people say the war in Iraq is separate from the war on terrorism than say it is a major or a minor part of the war on terrorism. This is a reversal from the results in December 2005, when 43% of people said it was separate, while 53% said it was a major or minor part of the war on terror.

<h2>President Bush's Approval Ratings</h2>

The latest poll indicates that 57% of Americans now disapprove of President Bush's performance as president, an increase from 51% who disapproved of his performance two months ago, and a dramatic increase from disapproval ratings of 21% in April 2003. His job approval is now at 34%, down from 42% two months ago. In April 2003, just after the start of the war in Iraq, President Bush had a job approval rating of 73%. When broken down by party affiliation, CBS reports that his approval rating is now 74% among &lt;a href="Republican%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;Republicans&lt;/a&gt;, 6% among &lt;a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt; and 28% among Independents.

The poll also found that more people disapprove than approve of the way Congress is handling its job. The approval rating for the President's handling of the war in Iraq is 31% and for foreign policy in general is 30%. Foreign-policy approval ratings vary by party affiliation, with 64% of Republicans approving, compared to 6% of Democrats and 24% of Independents. Similarly, 73% Republicans approve of the President's handling of the economy, compared to 9% of Democrats and 28% of Independents. 

The poll indicates that nearly two-thirds of Americans believe President Bush says things are better in Iraq than they actually are, up to 66% from 58% in January, and less than one-fourth believe that President Bush describes things accurately. In comparison, 24% feel the media portray the situation in Iraq as better than it is. By contrast, 35% say the media description is accurate. 

CBS report that the war in Iraq is still seen as the nation's most significant problem. 41% of Americans see the Democratic Party as more likely to make the right decisions regarding Iraq, while 35% see the Republican Party as more likely. The poll results also indicated that a similar number of people approve and disapprove of the President's efforts against terrorism. In contrast, more people approved than disapproved of these efforts back in January, when 52% approved and 43% disapproved.

Based on the latest CBS poll, nearly two thirds of Americans believe the country is on the wrong track, as opposed to a little over a quarter who believe the United States is on the right track. When divided by party affiliation, perception of being on the right track varies from 62% by Republicans to 20% by Independents to 8% by Democrats. When asked about companies from foreign countries operating U.S. ports, 42% say it is never okay, 17% said it is okay if the country was an ally, and 36% said it depends on the country.

A 30 year old Egyptian woman has died from an infection with the &lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt; strain of the &lt;a href="w%3AAvian%20influenza"&gt;avian flu&lt;/a&gt;. The cause of death was confirmed by the Cairo-based US Naval Medical Research Unit (NAMRU). The woman was keeping birds in her home in violation of a government ban on the practice.
The Egyptian Health Ministry has also reported that initial tests of a 28 year old man indicate that his is the second case of human infection in Egypt. Both cases were from the same area in the country, and both people reportedly were treated with the drug &lt;a href="w%3AOseltamivir"&gt;Tamiflu&lt;/a&gt;. Doctors are expecting the man to survive.

Nearly 100 people worldwide have died from the H5N1 virus, according to the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organization"&gt;World Health Organization (WHO)&lt;/a&gt;.

A New York Times report tells of a shadowy military unit named Task Force 6-26 which, in early 2004, used a former Iraqi military base near Baghdad as a top-secret detention center. Inside, American soldiers made one of the former Iraqi government's torture chambers into one of their own, dubbing it the Black Room.

The Black Room was a garage-sized room, painted jet-black and with no windows. Inside, soldiers beat prisoners and abused them verbally. They used them for target practice with paintball guns in a nearby area. The intention was to gain information from the detainees as to the whereabouts of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a Salafi Islamist militant, a guerrilla leader, and the putative leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq.

The temporary detention site was part of Camp Narma, the headquarters of Task Force 6-26, and was the first stop for many insurgents before going to the Abu Ghraib prison, which was a few miles away.

Australia's major newspapers are highlighting the personal relationship between the U.S. President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George Bush&lt;/a&gt; and his newly nominated Australian ambassador, &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20McCallum%2C%20Jr."&gt;Robert McCallum&lt;/a&gt;. Australian reporters Phillip Hudson of ♡❤The Age♡❤, and Mark Coultan of the ♡❤Sydney Morning Herald♡❤, have written stories examining the Bush/McCallum friendship which allegedly dates back to 39 years ago when they were inducted into the &lt;a href="w%3ASkull%20and%20Bones"&gt;Skull and Bones&lt;/a&gt; society.

The Australian ambassadorship post had been vacant for 13 months, which former deputy prime minister &lt;a href="w%3ATim%20Fischer"&gt;Tim Fischer&lt;/a&gt; said was an "unforgivable" delay. The McCallum nomination on March 11 would replace the former ambassador &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Schieffer"&gt;Tom Schieffer&lt;/a&gt; who left the post in February 2005. United States &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; nominated McCallum on March 11th.,2006

McCallum is an associate attorney-general for the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice"&gt;Department of Justice&lt;/a&gt; and previously represented &lt;a href="w%3ABig%20Tobacco"&gt;big tobacco&lt;/a&gt; companies at an &lt;a href="w%3AAtlanta"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt; law firm. He also has a master's degree from &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Oxford"&gt;Oxford University&lt;/a&gt; and is a &lt;a href="w%3ARhodes%20Scholarship"&gt;Rhodes Scholar&lt;/a&gt; as well as having a bachelor's degree from &lt;a href="w%3AYale%20University"&gt;Yale&lt;/a&gt;.

The two Australian papers report on activities of Bush and McCallum in their younger years, and the ♡❤Sydney Morning Herald♡❤ alleges that personal connections were instrumental in the career advancements of both men. 

McCallum also made news last year when he overrode U.S. Justice Department lawyers who had been handling the government's tobacco racketeering trial for the past 5 years. McCallum ordered the lawyers to reduce the penalties sought at the close of the nine-month trial from $130 billion to $10 billion, angering some of the trial lawyers to the point where it is reported they threatened to quit their jobs. McCallum said the reduction was necessary as a matter of law.

David Carry and Euan Dale yesterday pulled off a remarkable feat for &lt;a href="w%3AScotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; — claiming both first and second place in the 400m &lt;a href="w%3AMedley%20swimming%23Individual_Medley"&gt;Individual Medley&lt;/a&gt; swimming race in &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;.

For Carry, who swam a 4:15.98, the gold was his second of the games and Scotland's forth gold medal in &lt;a href="w%3Aswimming"&gt;swimming&lt;/a&gt; until now. He becomes the first Scottish person to win two golds at the games in thirty-two years — &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Wilkie%20%28swimmer%29"&gt;David Wilkie&lt;/a&gt; being the last Scot to do so in 1974.

The games have presented several surprises thus far — most notably &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia's&lt;/a&gt; failure to win more than one gold medal in the men's events up to this point. Matthew John Cowdrey won the sole gold medal for Australia in the 50m freestyle on Saturday. By contrast, the Australian women have had an excellent start so far, with a medal haul of 21 out of a possible 37.

&lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; once again demonstrated its strength in men's freestyle swimming by winning the 4 x 100m freestyle relay in 3:14.97, beating the Australian by slightly over half a second. &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; claimed third place.

In the Six Nations Cup, Ireland beat England 28 points to 24, to win The Triple Crown. France, on the other hand, won the overall championship. Remember — The Rugby World Cup is only but eighteen months away! Looking at Irelands performance in the championship they are certainly a team that gel well together and are on the way up.Ireland have now beaten England on the last three occasions that these sides have met.

Australian actor &lt;a href="w%3ARussell%20Crowe"&gt;Russell Crowe&lt;/a&gt; and businessman Peter Holmes a Court have succeeded in their bid to take over the &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Sydney%20Rabbitohs"&gt;South Sydney Rabbitohs&lt;/a&gt;, an Australian National Rugby League (NRL) Club. The men required that 75% of the club's members vote yes on the $3 million takeover bid for it to pass; and it narrowly won, by just 32 votes (0.8%). Former Souths player and manager, George Piggins, has vowed never to attend another game of his former club.

Supporters of the bid have said it gives the Rabbitohs a chance to return to their glory days after last year's finish of 13th in the 15-team competition. The team has not won a Premiership in 35 years but still retains the record for most Premiership wins, with 20 on the record books. Those against the bid objected that the club is selling out 98 years of heritage.

It appears that &lt;a href="Alexander%20Lukashenko"&gt;Alexander Lukashenko&lt;/a&gt;, 51, has won the 2006 &lt;a href="Belarus"&gt;Belarus&lt;/a&gt; presidential election, and is heading for his third term in office. The official preliminary results are 82.6 percent for Lukashenko and six percent for the main opposition candidate &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Milinkevich"&gt;Alexander Milinkevich&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , says the BBC. The turnout for the elections was 92.6 percent of Belarus' seven million eligible voters. The final results will be available Monday morning.

Before the elections, the opposition candidates accused Lukashenko of plans for rigging the elections. Several opposition newspapers were closed down and journalists were arrested some weeks before the elections. Many foreign observers, including the Polish, Finnish and Danish delegations, were refused entry into the country before the elections.

Approximately 10 000 supporters of Milinkevich gathered in Oktyabrskaya Square in Belarus' capital, &lt;a href="Minsk"&gt;Minsk&lt;/a&gt;. According to the BBC, they shouted anti-Lukashenko slogans and waved flags that are banned under Lukashenko's regime. The protests have not involved violence so far. 

Lukashenko previously warned people against the start of uprisings similar to recent ones witnessed in the &lt;a href="Ukraine"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Georgia%20%28country%29"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;. He said that people attempting to stage a coup will be treated as terrorists and will be executed. The &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; have expressed their concerns over allegedly authoritarian rule in Belarus. The EU is planning to deny visas to Belarusian officials with alleged involvement in election rigging, as a response to the denial by Belarus of entry into the country to EU election observers.

Milinkevich demands new elections. According to the BBC, he said, "We demand new, honest elections. This was a complete farce... We will demand that this election be recognized as invalid, including by international organisations," Milinkevich said, according to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAgence%20France-Presse"&gt;AFP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . 

Milinkevich notes that the opposition candidates were restricted from the media, and opposition supporters were arrested. Lukashenko, in contrast, has control over Belarus' propaganda machine, including state television. According to the AFP, opposition candidate Milinkevich received in total one hour of TV air time for his campaign. Belarus officials reject his demands, and insist the elections were free and honest. 

Lukashenko denied being a dictator, saying "... it's impossible to have a dictator in Europe. Only stupid people would think that." He said the U.S. president George W. Bush is more of a dictator than he himself is.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Cuba%20and%20Japan%20to%20play%20in%20WBC%20final&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Today, at 9:00 PM EST, &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Cuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt; will face off in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Baseball%20Classic"&gt;World Baseball Classic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; final. The matchup will take place in PETCO Park, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Diego%2C%20California"&gt;San Diego&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;. Coaches Higinio Velez of Cuba and Sadaharu Oh of Japan highly praised both teams. "We know the Asians," Velez said. "We have played against the Asians, we know how the Asian teams play, and they're great players. They put everything into the field, great effort, very similar to Latin American players. They play hard, they have their tactics, they have their technique, and all I can say is that you will have a wonderful game [Monday]." Cuba has a record of 5-1 against Japan at the Summer Olympics.

Cuba defeated a MLB player-filled team from the Dominican Republic 3-1 to earn this berth to the finals. Vicyohandri Odelin has been rumored to be the starter for Cuba tonight. Cuba has no MLB players, whereas the Japanese team has two—Ichiro Suzuki and Akinori Otsuka. Cuba has earned a medal at each Olympiad, taking the gold in 1992, 1996, 2004 and the silver in 2000. Before the World Baseball Classic even began, Cuba was at risk of not being able to attend, due to tension between the US and Cuba. However, Cuba has gone all the way with a 5-2 record, knocking out &lt;a href="Panama"&gt;Panama&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Venezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Puerto%20Rico"&gt;Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="Dominican%20Republic"&gt;Dominican Republic&lt;/a&gt; in the semifinal.

Japan barely made it into the semifinals through a complicated tiebreaking process, and managed to defeat an undefeated &lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;n team that had beaten them twice before with a shutout, 6-0. A two-run homer by young Kosuke Fukodome sealed the game. Led by their powerful coach, Sadaharu Oh, Japan was favored as the major Asian power, but instead struggled through qualification with a 3-3 record. They ravaged &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Mexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, but failed to overcome the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; or Korea. Ichiro Suzuki has led this team into the finals with a .345 average, one homer, and four stolen bases.

Fr Eusebio Ferrao (60), of St Francis Church in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMacasana"&gt;Macasana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, was found murdered in the early hours of the morning on Saturday, March 18, in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="wikt%3Apresbytery"&gt;presbytery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the church. Three people from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUttar%20Pradesh"&gt;Uttar Pradesh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; who stayed with Fr Ferraro and had dinner with him Friday night are suspected of suffocating him with a pillow. The Archbishop has urged the authorities to find the culprits and bring them to justice. 

Fr Ferrao, a diocesan priest, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKonkan"&gt;Konknni&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; writer and the parish priest of Macasana Parish in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Goa"&gt;South Goa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , was found dead by parishoners on Saturday morning.

When he did not arrive to celebrate mass, parishoners went to check at the parish house and found him. His cook was found bound and gagged in the house.

The Macasana parish, dedicated to the patron saint of Goa, St Francis Xavier, was set up in 1809 and is situated in the southern subprovince of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASalcette"&gt;Salcette&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , India.

According to the last available records, it has a Catholic population of 3,200.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
On Saturday March 18, citizens in Buffalo demonstrated to make their voices be heard. The protest mounted by people opposed to the Elmwood Village Hotel proposal took place on the proposed site at Forest and Elmwood Avenues.

The Elmwood Village Hotel is a 72-room, seven-million-dollar hotel proposed by Savarino Construction Services Corporation. The hotel would require the demolition of at least five buildings (1109-1121 Elmwood), which house several shops and residents. Karl Frizlen, an architect with Frizlen Group, designed the hotel. Although the properties are "under contract," it is still unknown if Savarino Construction actually owns the buildings. It is believed that Hans Mobius, a resident of Clarence, New York and former Buffalo Mayorial candidate, is still the owner. The hotel is expected to be a franchise of the Wyndham Hotels group.

Despite the cold weather, at least 40 people showed up to walk the picket line for 2 two hours.
Clarence Carnahan, a Buffalo resident, supplied signs that citizens could use during the protest. Some of the signs said, 'No vacancy, No hotel,' 'No tell hotel,' 'Hans off' and 'Our neighborhood, our choice, no hotel.'

"The concern is they are going to tear down established businesses that have been here for years," said Charles Leist, a protester.

"We're fighting to the bitter end. We're hoping that we can squelch this. We don't think we can, but we're going down kicking and screaming," said Patty Morris, co-owner with Nancy Pollina of Don Apparel at 1119 Elmwood. Don Apparel is a vintage clothing and collectible shop and has been at the same location for nearly 14 years.

The city's Common Council is expected to vote on the proposal on Tuesday, March 21, 2006 at 2:00 PM in Council Chambers, on 13th floor in City Hall.

The Planning Board is expected to vote on the proposal on Tuesday, March 28, at 8:00 AM in room 902 on the 9th floor of City Hall.

Even if the Common Council approves the proposal, the Planning board will get the final say in the matter.

So far, no other protests are scheduled. Organizers say they will wait until the Common Council votes before organizing any more protests.

Scott David Dover, 45, a father of two young boys in &lt;a href="w%3ACedar%20City%2C%20Utah"&gt;Cedar City, Utah&lt;/a&gt;, was arrested on Thursday and charges against the father could be filed today.

Police say he used electric dog collars to discipline his children. Conviction could result in up to 15 years in prison. Dover is being held in Iron County Jail; bail was set at ten thousand dollars.

Police Sgt. Jerry Womack said that the boys, both about six years old, did not have any burns or marks on them and that it was not known whether the collars had ever been placed around their necks. He also said, however, that Dover admitted to using the collars on his sons.

"It sounds bad, but it actually administers a mild shock. He just felt that was an option for discipline. We disagree vehemently," said Womack.

Cedar City Police were contacted on Wednesday by the Department of Child and Family Services.

"The kids are OK. Try to always remember that this child needs guidance, protection and someone to show them the way. To us, discipline means guidance, working with children on their strengths or showing them that some things could be done differently," said Carol Sisco, spokeswoman for the Utah Department of Human Services.

The "shock-collars" emit small electrical currents and are used for training dogs.

So far, the mother has not been charged. Latest reports said the boys were still living with her. Police are still deciding whether to file charges against her.

The American &lt;a href="w%3ANBC"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt; journalist and &lt;a href="wikt%3AHollywood"&gt;Hollywood&lt;/a&gt; actress &lt;a href="w%3AMaria_Menounos"&gt;Maria Menounos&lt;/a&gt; gave her first official press conference in Greece, as a presenter of the semi-final and the final of the &lt;a href="w%3AEurovision_Song_Contest_2006"&gt;Eurovision Song Contest 2006&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http%3A//www.eurovision.tv/english/index.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which will take place in Athens on the 18th and 20th of &lt;a href="w%3AMay"&gt;May&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3A2006"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;.

Menounos, who is of Greek ancestry and speaks fluent Greek, arrived yesterday in Athens. Today, she talked about the presentation of the song contest and expressed her excitement about being in Greece. She will present the song contest along with the popular Greek pop star &lt;a href="w%3ASakis_Rouvas"&gt;Sakis Rouvas&lt;/a&gt;.

Before official confirmation by &lt;a href="w%3AElliniki_Radiophonia_Tileorassi"&gt;Greek National Television&lt;/a&gt; (ERT) of Menounos as the co-host of the contest, Greek media had reported the names of the famous actresses &lt;a href="w%3AJennifer_Aniston"&gt;Jennifer Aniston&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMonica_Bellucci"&gt;Monica Bellucci&lt;/a&gt; as possible presenters.

The Eurovision Song Contest 2006 final and semi-final will take place in the &lt;a href="w%3AAthens_Olympic_Sports_Complex%23Olympic_Indoor_Hall"&gt;Olympic Indoor Hall&lt;/a&gt; in Athens.

The &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFrench%20National%20Assembly"&gt;National Assembly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is to adopt a bill, known as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADADVSI"&gt;DADVSI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (♡❤« Droits d'Auteurs et Droits Voisins de la Société de l'Information »♡❤, "author's right and related rights in the information society"), tomorrow. This bill reforms the French code of intellectual property (CPI) and other laws, mostly in order to implement the 2001 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEU%20Copyright%20Directive"&gt;European directive on copyright&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The directive mandates legal protections of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADigital%20rights%20management"&gt;Digital rights management&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (DRM) measures against circumvention. DRMs are "digital locks" that prevent users from freely copying or playing contents, in order to enforce the copyright of the authors, artists, publishers and producers. The initial draft of the bill, proposed by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMinister%20of%20Culture%20%28France%29"&gt;Minister of Culture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARenaud%20Donnedieu%20de%20Vabres"&gt;Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , made circumvention of DRMs, or even facilitation thereof, a felony (♡❤délit♡❤), with a maximal penalty of 3 years in prison and/or a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A%E2%82%AC"&gt;€&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 300,000 fine as with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acounterfeiting"&gt;counterfeiting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Since DRMs, circumvention and facilitations were not legally defined, it was feared that the law would effectively prevent competitors from creating players, especially based on &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Afree%20software"&gt;free software&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , compatible with major systems such as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AApple%20Inc."&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AiPod"&gt;iPod&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWindows%20Media%20Player"&gt;Windows Media Player&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;mdash; or even to prevent the creation of any free software capable of loading files with DRM capabilities, that is, potentially most future text, audio or video &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Afile%20format"&gt;file formats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The initial draft also conserved the threat of a counterfeiting felony conviction for those exchanging copyrighted files on the Internet. This was judged to be unfairly repressive and unrealistic. In France, it is commonplace for Internet users to have broadband up to 16 megabits per second in cheaply priced (€30 a month or lower) &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AADSL"&gt;ADSL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; packages, often comprising &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVoIP"&gt;VoIP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; phone and television ; millions of users, especially the young, are believed to use &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Apeer-to-peer"&gt;peer-to-peer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; file sharing software. Lawmakers, from both the majority &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnion%20for%20a%20popular%20movement"&gt;UMP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; party and the opposition, found it unwise to turn millions of citizens into potential felons. As a consequence, the Minister proposed a "gradual" scheme where mere downloading of one file would be punishable by a €38 fine, which was adopted as an amendment. It remains to be seen how the law will be enforced.

With respects to DRMs, lawmakers from both the majority UMP party, the centrist &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnion%20for%20French%20democracy"&gt;Union for French democracy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the opposition adopted amendments that make it compulsory for publishers of DRM-encumbered content to give the specifications to whomever would like to implement a compatible player. This proposal was decried by some &lt;a href="US"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; news sources as targeting Apple Computer's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AiTunes"&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; system, tied to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AiPod"&gt;iPod&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; players. It is yet unknown, though, if these amendments would apply to companies that choose not to claim the new special protection awarded to DRMs by the law, which enable them to sue those who implement software meant to circumvent their protections.

Lawmakers also expressed concerns that the proposed law would weaken existing legal exceptions to copyright, especially the right for users to make copies of copyrighted files for private use (CPI L122-5).

The lawmaking process was quite a bumpy one. In December, lawmakers adopted a surprise amendment that would legalize peer-to-peer sharing as "private copy", much to the dismay of the Minister of Culture. The amendment, proposed by a bipartisan coalition of majority UMP and opposition lawmakers, was the first in a series that would have established a system known as the "global license" through which Internet users would have paid a flat fee in exchange for an authorization to use peer-to-peer services. The fees collected would be redistributed to authors and performers. In March, the Minister tried to withdraw article 1 of the law, which was the one that was amended to his dislike, but the next day he had to reintroduce it because withdrawing it may have been unconstitutional. The Assembly then voted the article down and adopted an Article 1 "bis", essentially an amended version of article 1 without the legalization of peer-to-peer sharing.

The law, initially presented as an uncontroversial, technical text, soon became a hot topic. Some lawmakers, both from the opposition and the majority, decried intense lobbying by the entertainment industry. Some amendments were nicknamed the "&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVivendi%20Universal"&gt;Vivendi Universal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; amendment", from the name of a major entertainment company that some lawmakers and commentators claim has inspired them. UMP lawmakers such as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABernard%20Carayon"&gt;Bernard Carayon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; denounced pressures and even blackmail from some powerful lobbies.

The Assembly will very probably adopt the bill on March 21, despite the opposition of some UMP, UDF and opposition lawmakers. The bill will then be sent to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFrench%20Senate"&gt;French Senate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for further amendment and approval. Since the government declared the bill to be urgent, it is probably that after examination by the Senate, the bill will be sent to a mixed Assembly/Senate commission for harmonization, then finally voted. Given that some UMP and opposition lawmakers have voiced concerns about the constitutionality of some episodes of the lawmaking process, it is likely that the bill will get sent to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AConstitutional%20Council%20of%20France"&gt;Constitutional Council&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for constitutional review. Finally, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20France"&gt;president&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="Jacques%20Chirac"&gt;Jacques Chirac&lt;/a&gt; is likely to sign it into law.

&lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Parker%20%28New%20Zealand%29"&gt;David Parker&lt;/a&gt; resigned today from Cabinet, a day after he resigned his position as Attorney-General and after publicity around his filing of an incorrect declaration with the Companies Office on behalf of Queens Park Mews Limited.

The declaration said that the three shareholders had unanimously agreed not to appoint an auditor for the company; but according to ♡❤Investigate Magazine♡❤, another shareholder, Russell Hyslop, had never been consulted about the matter.

Parker confesses to making a "mistake" over the returns. He says when Hyslop was declared &lt;a href="w%3Abankrupt"&gt;bankrupt&lt;/a&gt; in 1997, he cleared it with the &lt;a href="w%3AOfficial%20Assignee"&gt;Official Assignee&lt;/a&gt; for the first two years. He then forgot to clear on other years.

Parker was saying early this morning that he would persist in holding his other portfolios. 

Knowingly authorising a false statement is an offence under the Companies Act. The maximum penalty under section 373(4) for filing a false return is a fine of $200,000 or five years of imprisonment.

The &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20Nationals"&gt;Washington Nationals&lt;/a&gt;' biggest offseason acquisition, &lt;a href="w%3AAlfonso%20Soriano"&gt;Alfonso Soriano&lt;/a&gt;, refused Monday to take left field in the Nationals' spring training game against the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Nationals threatened Soriano with disqualification if he refuses to take the field Tuesday against the St. Louis Cardinals, which could result in the forfeiture of some or all of his 2006 salary, which is in the neighborhood of $10 million.

Soriano, normally a second baseman, has steadfastly refused to be moved to the outfield. He has also requested a trade if the Nationals do not intend to use him as their starting second baseman over Jose Vidro.

This issue has been hanging over the heads of the Nationals organization since Soriano was acquired in a trade from the Texas Rangers in December. However, as Soriano played with the Dominican Republic in the World Baseball Classic, Monday was the first day that he was scheduled to play for the Nationals during spring training.

After every earthquake, flood, or other disaster, the call goes out for pledges to fund emergency relief. Then a second round of begging tries to convert those pledges into actual payments. In the meantime, some relief is delayed, and people die. Money that does eventually come may not be in proportion to the need. For example, relief funding for the 26 December 2004 &lt;a href="w%3Atsunami"&gt;tsunami&lt;/a&gt; generally came rapidly and exceeded the amount requested, but famine relief for 3.5 million Kenyans suffering drought is now &lt;a href="http%3A//www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp%3FNewsID%3D17786%26amp%3BCr%3DKenya%26amp%3BCr1%3D"&gt;75% underfunded&lt;/a&gt;.

To help solve these problems, the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; this month created the Central Emergency Response Fund (&lt;a href="w%3ACERF"&gt;CERF&lt;/a&gt;) as a rainy-day savings account, to be dipped into when urgent needs require that money be spent within days--not in several months after aid pledges start being fulfilled. The Fund is about half way to the goal of half a billion dollars in deposits, which could be spent for either natural or man-made disasters.
"We meet to launch a fund that is proactive rather than reactive. The CERF will provide a ready pool of resources that better empower the United Nations in funding immediate relief efforts in the aftermath of disasters," said UN Secretary-General &lt;a href="w%3AKofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt; on March 9.

&lt;a href="w%3AJan%20Egeland%2C"&gt;Jan Egeland,&lt;/a&gt; the UN Emergency Relief Coordinator, will manage the Fund. "We are working on the two first allocations from the CERF...One is to the Horn of Africa and Kenya drought, the other one is to Cote d'Ivoire where humanitarian work and the civilian population is suffering so much," he said. "Too often, aid resembles a lottery in which a few win but most lose based on considerations other than need. We must move from lottery to predictability so all those who suffer receive aid."

The biggest donations paid so far are $41 million from Sweden and $30 million from Norway. The largest pledges are $70 million from the United Kingdom and $24 million from the Netherlands.

&lt;br&gt;

Today at around 6:00 a.m. UTC, Akinori Otsuka struck out Cuban star Youlieski Gourriel to give &lt;a href="w%3AJapan_national_baseball_team"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; a 10-6 victory over &lt;a href="w%3ACuba_national_baseball_team"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt; in the inaugural &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Baseball%20Classic"&gt;World Baseball Classic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3ADaisuke_Matsuzaka"&gt;Daisuke Matsuzaka&lt;/a&gt; recorded the win with a 1.38 ERA and was named the tournament's most valuable player. The game was played in PETCO Park before a crowd of 42,696.
The highly-touted Japanese team took a commanding lead in the first inning. Vicyohandry Odelin walked one man with the bases loaded, and hit another. The four-run first inning was capped off by Toshiake Imae's two-run single. Cuba used three pitchers in the inning, including starter Omari Romero and reliever Norberto Gonzalez.
Japan also added two more runs in the fifth inning, after three straight base hits to start the inning and Michihiro Ogasawara's sacrifice fly with one out. &lt;a href="w%3AIchiro%20Suzuki"&gt;Ichiro Suzuki&lt;/a&gt;'s one-out RBI single off of Adiel Palma in the ninth drove in Osmani Urrutia, which proved to be the winning run. After an intentional walk, Kosuke Fukudome put the game away with a base hit to left that scored two. Michihiro Ogaswara added a sacrifice fly.

Cuba's Eduardo Paret started the bottom of the first inning with a solo home run that landed in the first row of the left field stands.
Cuba mounted a rally in the ninth, when Ariel Pastano led off with a double. He was eventually driven in by Cuban shortstop Eduardo Peret's infield single, but Cuba was unable to score any more runs.
Cuba responded with four straight hits of their own in the bottom of the sixth, scoring two runs. Designated hitter Yoandy Garlobo grounded into an inning-ending double play, with men on first and third.
Frederich Cepeda's two-run home run in the bottom of the eighth inning off of Soichi Fujita cut the Japanese lead to 6-5, before the four-run Japanese ninth put the game away.

After 5 failed tries at the Olympics, Japan has finally capped it off with this gold-medal win at the Classic. "My players showed me a fantastic performance tonight," &lt;a href="w%3ASadaharu%20Oh"&gt;Sadaharu Oh&lt;/a&gt;, the team's coach, said through a translator after the game. "I know they did it for Japan." Most people agree that this victory has driven home the fact that baseball is now an international sport, not just an American sport. The team has stuck with the tournament, through bad calls and good alike, and the reward was the sterling silver trophy presented to them as champions of the World Baseball Classic. Even Ichiro Suzuki was amazed by their work, saying "To be honest, I never imagined we'd get there. We had a great team, the best. I hope we showed everyone what a great sport baseball is." 

Cuba's amazing run was stopped short, but beisbol was still at the top of Cuba's mind after the defeat. “Personally, I think we have shown the quality of Cuban players,” Cuba manager Higinio Velez said. “I told everybody to have patience. I said we are team of men, not names.” The Cuban team barreled through so many major leaguers, but today everything cracked, especially the pitching. However, they never gave up, rallying in the last inning, but just like Frederich Cepeda said, “We went and fought for this game just like every other game in this tournament, but Japan also went out and fought for this game. We tried to get back on top, but they played better than we did and they deserve the victory because they played better.” Due to the deal that allowed Cuba into the WBC, they are donating all their money to Hurricane Katrina Victims.

MLB commissioner and WBC organizer Bud Selig admitted, "The intensity in the stands as well as the intensity on the playing field was absolutely remarkable, and I'm not sure that going into it you could have felt that. I'm very confident that this will be the platform that we use to take this sport internationally to the dimension that I want to take it and believe that we will." Spikes worn by Oh, a jersey worn by Matsuzaka, a baseball cap worn by Nobuhiko Matsunaka, a helmet worn by Ichiro, and a warm-up jacket worn by Koji Uehara, will all be sent to Cooperstown's Baseball Hall of Fame to be displayed.

After every earthquake, flood, or other disaster, the call goes out for pledges to fund emergency relief. Then a second round of begging tries to convert those pledges into actual payments. In the meantime, some relief is delayed, and people die. Money that does eventually come may not be in proportion to the need. For example, relief funding for the 26 December 2004 &lt;a href="w%3Atsunami"&gt;tsunami&lt;/a&gt; generally came rapidly and exceeded the amount requested, but famine relief for 3.5 million Kenyans suffering drought is now &lt;a href="http%3A//www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp%3FNewsID%3D17786%26amp%3BCr%3DKenya%26amp%3BCr1%3D"&gt;75% underfunded&lt;/a&gt;. 

To help solve these problems, the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; this month created the Central Emergency Response Fund (&lt;a href="w%3ACERF"&gt;CERF&lt;/a&gt;) as a rainy-day savings account, to be dipped into when urgent needs require that money be spent within days--not in several months after aid pledges start being fulfilled. The Fund is about half way to the goal of half a billion dollars in deposits, which could be spent for either natural or man-made disasters.
"We meet to launch a fund that is proactive rather than reactive. The CERF will provide a ready pool of resources that better empower the United Nations in funding immediate relief efforts in the aftermath of disasters," said UN Secretary-General &lt;a href="w%3AKofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt; on March 9.

&lt;a href="w%3AJan%20Egeland"&gt;Jan Egeland&lt;/a&gt;, the UN Emergency Relief Coordinator, will manage the Fund. "We are working on the two first allocations from the CERF...One is to the Horn of Africa and Kenya drought, the other one is to Cote d'Ivoire where humanitarian work and the civilian population is suffering so much," he said. "Too often, aid resembles a lottery in which a few win but most lose based on considerations other than need. We must move from lottery to predictability so all those who suffer receive aid."

The biggest donations paid so far are $41 million from Sweden and $30 million from Norway. The largest pledges are $70 million from the United Kingdom and $24 million from the Netherlands.

Areas in far north Queensland remain without electricity, running water or sewerage after Category 5 Cyclone Larry hit the coast on Monday morning. Queensland Premier Peter Beattie has declared a state of emergency in Innisfail and says he is worried about the outbreak of diseases. Army engineers are among more than 1,000 people assisting in Queensland's cyclone relief effort.

Premier Beattie says it could be more than a week before power is restored in Innisfail. "The whole bloody place is blown apart... this is going to be a long, slow recovery," he said. 

Larry caused widespread damage as it crossed the coast south of Cairns, with winds of up to 290km/h (180 mph). Thousands of buildings were damaged and most of the Australia's banana crop has been destroyed. Thousands of kilometres of power lines were brought down. Many key roads are flooded.

State Emergency Service volunteers are putting tarpaulins on damaged homes. "Some homes will need complete rebuilding and that will take many months. But right now let's get the bandaids out and get people settled as much as we can and then start the serious rebuilding of the Innisfail area." said Kathryn Ryan, from the Disaster Management Group

Hospitals are unable to cope with the lack of clean running water and reliable power supplies. There are concerns about outbreaks of dengue fever and other mosquito-borne diseases. "Our main concern is with the quality of the drinking water, the quality of people's food supplies and any health risks from inundation by water," a health spokesman said.

Queensland Health Minister Jim Guthrie says there is no electricity in Innisfail, the hardest hit town in Cyclone Larry's path. "It's just too difficult to keep the hospital operating," he said. "There's no mains power but they're also having trouble with generators - there's a lack of fuel."

The region's banana, sugar cane and avocado farm industries will need rebuilding. Jan Davis, of fruit growers' group Growcom, says Cyclone Larry will have widespread effects on the fruit industry. 

Among supplies flowing in were nearly 10,500 gallons of water and 6,000 in-flight meals provided by Qantas. Troops also set up a water purification unit, and health authorities warned residents to boil their water. "There most certainly would be around 7,000 people … that are effectively homeless," Federal Minister Bob Katter told The Associated Press. "They're sitting in four walls but no roof." Some 17,000 homes were blacked out in Cairns.

Ergon Energy Regional services manager Geoff Bowes says generators have been sent to Innisfail to provide power for sewerage works and some supermarkets and extra staff have been flown in from Brisbane and Townsville. "Nothing could prepare us for this," he said. 

The Australian reports that building industry and government sources have estimated the cost of Larry as "one of Australia's most costly natural disasters, with a damage bill expected to exceed $1.5 billion."

So far there have been no deaths or major injuries reported. Forecasters have warned of more wild weather for Queensland, with a second cyclone expected to approach the coast later this week. The Bureau of Meteorology say Tropical Cyclone Wati is moving towards the west-northwest at 13 km per hour and should gradually intensify over the next 24 hours.

Charles Martin, 66, of Union Township, Ohio called 911 on Sunday saying, "I just killed a kid. I shot him with a goddamn .410 shotgun, twice. He's laying in the yard." 

Police say Martin shot and killed Larry Mugrage, 15, a high school freshman, for walking onto his lawn on Sunday. 

"I've been harassed by him and his parents for five years. Today just blew it up," Martin told dispatchers when he called 911.

Martin has been charged with murder.

On Monday, Judge James Shriver ordered that Martin be held without bail. A hearing is scheduled for Thursday.

Thousands of people around the world took to the streets in a "Global Day of Action" to mark the third anniversary of the US-led invasion of Iraq. The weekend rallies and demonstrations drew smaller crowds than earlier anti-war demonstrations, when millions gathered in 2003 and 2004. US President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;, with dwindling public support for the war, marked the occasion with a speech, outlining his commitment to democracy in the region. 

<h2>In the U.S.A.</h2>

Tens of thousands of protesters gathered this weekend across the United States to protest what they say is the continuing occupation of Iraq. Protestors called for accountability from the current administration. According to U.S. group, United for Peace and Justice, over 500 cities planned protests in all 50 U.S. states. 

In Portland Oregon, about 10,000 anti-war protesters took almost an hour to pass through downtown streets on Sunday 19th March. Some carried signs reading: "Impeach the Evildoer." On Saturday, more than 7,000 people marched through downtown Chicago. About 200 people gathered Sunday at Chalmette National Cemetery to protest the military conflict overseas. They say the war had hurt the country's ability to help New Orleans recover from hurricane disaster. Around 20 demonstrators were arrested in Washington, DC. About 200 joined a march Sunday along New York's Fifth Avenue. 

In Toronto, Canada some 1,000 protesters converged opposite the U.S. consulate. In Ottawa, dozens of demonstrators gathered two blocks from Parliament Hill and later at the National Gallery to protest the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Several hundred protesters marched through downtown Halifax. Protests in Montreal and Vancouver also attracted hundreds. 

In Seoul, 1,000 people demonstrated - urging the South Korean government to bring their troops home. South Korea has 3,200 troops in northern Iraq - the largest contingent of foreign troops after the US and Britain. In Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, about 600 people protested peacefully - in contrast to the 2005 gathering when police fired on demonstrators with water cannons. In Tokyo, about 800 demonstrators took to the streets, after some 2000 protested the day earlier.

About 1,000 protesters gathered near New York's Times Square at a rally where speakers denounced the Bush administration and the continuing US troop presence in Iraq. The demonstrations were organised by many diverse groups. 

<h2>Global Action</h2>

Many more thousands also gathered in cities around the globe, including in the Iraqi cities of Basra and Baghdad. In Rome tens of thousands took to the streets, with signs: "Stop the war in Iraq" and "No to the war for oil." Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, a supporter of US President George W. Bush, sent nearly 3,000 Italian soldiers to Iraq despite the objections of a majority of Italians.

In London, police estimated a crowd of at least 15,000 showed up for the anti-war march. The city's Mayor Ken Livingstone made an appearance at the event in Trafalgar Square which peace groups had organised to demand the immediate withdrawal of 8,000 British troops, the second largest military contingent after the United States in Iraq.

A turnout of several thousand people was reported in Denmark, Greece, Spain and Turkey. In Athens, nearly 2,000 protesters marched to the US embassy, led by Palestinian immigrants who chanted anti-American slogans, "Get the imperialists out of Iraq and Afghanistan" and "Bush is terrorist Number One". Protests were also held outside US facilities at Souda military base on the island of Crete and in Greece's second city of Salonika.

Demonstrators in Istanbul, led by leftist and Islamist groups, called for the American troops to pull out of Iraq with banners saying "United States, go home". Communist party officials in Portugal organised an anti-war rally in Lisbon, claiming solidarity with "the fight of the Iraqi people". In Copenhagen, some 3,000 people marched in the streets, organisers and police said, with banners reading "Bring back the troops now". Demonstrators rallied outside the US embassy before marching on to the British embassy. Police said one person was arrested.

Peace activists staged a peaceful march in Geneva where one of the anti-war organisers said that "there is even less legitimacy to the American presence in Iraq today than there was three years ago". In Stockholm where a few hundred people braved the cold and falling hail to gather at an outdoor rally in the Swedish capital, the mother of a British soldier killed in Iraq took the stage, putting the blame on the US and British leaders. In Barcelona, Spain, 2,000 people - according to police - joined a march protesting the war. 

<h2>Australia</h2>
In Australia actions drew around 1,000 people in both Sydney and Melbourne demonstrated, with smaller rallies in other cities. Reports in Perth indicate between 500 and 1000 people took part in a demonstration.

The government still has over 1,300 troops on duty in and around Iraq. In February, Prime minister John Howard announced an additional 450 ADF troops will be sent to Iraq, despite other countries withdrawing numbers. Mr Howard justified the reversal of policy as being in the "broader interests of democracy in the Middle East". 

Australia's oppostion Defence Spokesman Robert McClelland said it's a "question of resources". For instance, we've spent $1.2 billion on the war in Iraq to date, and that's more than we spend each year on the entire Australian Federal Police budget," he said. "Australian people are very concerned that we're going to be sucked along into a civil war situation in Iraq." 

"The truckloads of tortured, mutilated bodies, smashed infrastructure and cost of the Iraq war now approaching one trillion Australian dollars are outcomes of the Prime Minister's decision to back President Bush's invasion 3 years ago," Greens Leader Bob Brown said.

A Hawker Britton opinion poll suggests that almost two thirds of Australians want ADF troops to leave Iraq within the next couple months. Last week, visiting US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was heckled by campaigners in Sydney, who accused her of "war crimes" and having "blood on her hands".

<h2>US President maintains "reason for hope"</h2>
President Bush marked the third anniversary of the start of Operation Iraqi Freedom with a speech given in Cleveland, Ohio. Elaborating on the effort to build democracy in Iraq Mr Bush said, "We are implementing a strategy that will lead to victory... the United States will not abandon Iraq," he said. "Americans have never retreated in the face of thugs and assassins, and we will not begin now."

According to Bloomberg, President Bush is giving a series of speeches aimed at "rallying Americans behind his policies." The U.S. has 133,000 troops in Iraq. U.S. military deaths in Iraq have surpassed 2,300. Public support for the war is falling and the cost of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan rising to $9.8 billion a month. 

The President told the audience: "in the face of continued reports about killings and reprisals" he could "understand how some Americans have had their confidence shaken," he said. "Others look at the violence they see each night on their television screens, and they wonder how I can remain so optimistic about the prospects of success in Iraq. They wonder what I see that they don't." He alluded to the northern Iraqi city, Tal Afar. He said the city "was once a key base of operations for al Qaeda and is today a free city that gives reason for hope for a free Iraq."

Much of downtown Cleveland where Mr Bush spoke was barricaded off by Police. About 100 anti-war protesters chanted for the president to leave. The group held signs with peace messages and beat drums. 

Four polls published last week put Bush's approval ratings at an all-time low - somewhere between 33 and 36 per cent. A CNN/Gallup poll has his approval rating at 36 per cent. The Pew Centre's poll put approval at 33 - the lowest rating of his presidency.

U.S. Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld wrote in the Washington Post on Monday, arguing the Iraqi insurgency was failing. He wrote: "Turning our backs on post-war Iraq today would be the modern equivalent of handing post-war Germany back to the Nazis." Vice President Dick Cheney also "remains optimistic about the outcome of the US involvement."

<h2>Iraq Conflict continues</h2>
Three years on, with 2,300 Americans killed, 17,000 troops injured, somewhere between 30,000 and 100,000 Iraqis killed and the onset of "civil war," the US occupation of Iraq costs $200 million each day. 

Meanwhile the conflict continues in Iraq. On Tuesday around 100 Iraqi insurgent fighters, armed with automatic rifles and rocket-propelled grenades, stormed a jail near Baghdad, killing at least 17 policemen. Authorities said all 33 prisoners were freed and 10 attackers were killed. After burning the police station, the group detonated roadside bombs as they fled. At least 13 policemen and civilians and 15 gunmen were wounded in the attack. 

A recent wave of violence has left more than 1,000 Iraqis dead since the bombing last month of a Shiite Muslim shrine.

During the large demonstration against the impending so-called First Employment Contract law (in French: &lt;a href="w%3AContrat%20premi%C3%A8re%20embauche"&gt;Contrat de Première Embauche&lt;/a&gt; - CPE) on Saturday in Paris, one of the demonstrators was perilously injured in the head. Now, allegations have been brought against the French riot police &lt;a href="w%3ACompagnies%20R%C3%A9publicaines%20de%20S%C3%A9curit%C3%A9"&gt;Compagnies Républicaines de Sécurité&lt;/a&gt; (CRS). Eyewitnesses report that officers of the CRS kicked 39-year-old Cyril Ferez while he was lying on the ground. A report of a CRS-officer draws a different picture of the incident.

The incident happened during the evacuation of the &lt;a href="w%3Afr%3APlace%20de%20la%20Nation"&gt;Place de la Nation&lt;/a&gt; by the CRS at the end of the demonstration against the first employment contracts at about 8.30 p.m. Cyril Ferez works for the Orange telecommunication company in Torcy and is a member of the trade union &lt;a href="w%3Afr%3ASud-PTT"&gt;Sud-PTT&lt;/a&gt;, which represents workers at post offices and telecommunication companies. According to the photographer Bruno Stevens, Cyril Ferez was running away from the police, together with some other demonstrators. "He was slower. He was hit directly on the head. He collapsed like a sack. They hit him further while he was lying on the ground," the photographer told the French newspaper Libération. While he was hit by the police, he did not react in any hostile way towards them, said another photographer, Victor Tonelli. The police are said to have hit the demonstrator with night sticks and with their feet. The trade union Sud-PTT accuses the police of not having called for medical help for the injured person, despite having been called to do so. The trade union demands an official meeting with the home secretary on Wednesday afternoon and calls the behaviour of the police as not being worthy of the government of a democratic state. According to a report of the press association Reuters, the seriously injured person was immediately hospitalised. According to members of the government, referring to the treating doctors, Cyril Ferez was admitted to the hospital Henri-Mondor de Créteil with 2.7 grammes of alcohol in his blood. According to a report of a CRS-officer, with a copy of it on hand of the press association AFP and relying on statements of Cyril Ferez (before he fell into his coma), the injuries are not a result of a fight between CRS-officers and Cyril Ferez. According to this report, Cyril Ferez was attacked by other demonstrators. The report was given to the police audit. Members of the opposition party and the trade unions demand a complete clearing up of the incident.

On Sunday morning, Cyril Ferez fell into a coma. The police audit "Inspection générale des services" wants to investigate the incident. Therefore, the police audit would like to find out which witnesses were on site and which officers of the CRS were involved in the incident. Doctors assume that Cyril Ferez, if he survives, will suffer from neurological consequences. Directly after the demonstration, the police prefecture had claimed that 18 demonstrators had been injured, but that there was no seriously injured person among them.

French trade unions and student organisations have announced a general strike for 28 March. On Saturday, about 1.5 million people participated in the countrywide demonstrations against CPE.

Engineers at &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;'s Yellow Sheep River have developed a desktop computer, called a Municator, which costs only €123 ($150 US). The machine is designed to help bridge the &lt;a href="w%3Adigital%20divide"&gt;digital divide&lt;/a&gt; in China and to expand China's small domestic semiconductor industry. Its development has been heavily subsidized by local governments.

The Municator measures 14.5 x 18 x 3.7 cm. (5.7 x 7.1 x 1.5 in.), and weighs 0.65 kg. (1.4 pounds). It is expected to use an existing TV as a monitor. The operating system is a &lt;a href="w%3AGNU/Linux"&gt;GNU/Linux&lt;/a&gt; distribution, known as Thinix 3.0, which is developed by YellowSheepRiver Inc. itself and overseen by the Chinese government for security reasons. The Municator was shown last week at the 2006 &lt;a href="w%3ACeBIT"&gt;CeBIT Fair&lt;/a&gt; in Hannover, Germany.

Video coverage from CeBIT 2006 speculated that the Municator will include applications such as: &lt;a href="w%3AMozilla%20Firefox"&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; for web browsing, &lt;a href="w%3AMozilla%20Thunderbird"&gt;Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt; for e-mail, &lt;a href="w%3AGaim"&gt;Gaim&lt;/a&gt; for instant messaging, &lt;a href="Skype"&gt;Skype&lt;/a&gt; for VoIP, Red Office (99 percent compatible with Microsoft Office and based on Open Office) for Linux for word processing, and &lt;a href="w%3AMPlayer"&gt;MPlayer&lt;/a&gt; for audio/video playback. The Skype application for VoIP is currently only available from Skype on i386-32 processors under Linux, but CeBit's video briefly shows a beta version of Skype running on the Municator's screen.

The 64-bit &lt;a href="w%3AGodson%20II"&gt;Godson 2c&lt;/a&gt; 400-800 MHz CPU used in the machine has a MIPS-like instruction set, and is roughly as fast as a 500-mHz Pentium III. The Godson II is made exclusively in China, and consumes relatively little power for its speed in comparison to x86 Intel and compatible AMD chips. A similar Chinese laptop project called the &lt;a href="w%3ALongmeng"&gt;Longmeng&lt;/a&gt; also uses the Godson II.

No version of Microsoft Windows supports the Godson II, and due to the independent nature of the Chinese government, the Municator is unlikely to ever run Microsoft Windows or its applications. Banners at CeBIT 2006 proclaim "Say No To Wintel Try Now!"

The &lt;a href="w%3AMIT%20Media%20Lab"&gt;MIT Media Lab&lt;/a&gt; has a similar initiative to develop an inexpensive Linux machine, known as the &lt;a href="w%3A%24100%20laptop"&gt;$100 laptop&lt;/a&gt;, which seeks to begin production by the end of 2007.

According to &lt;a href="w%3AAthanasios%20Angelopoulos"&gt;Athanasios Angelopoulos&lt;/a&gt; — who, along with theology professor Athanasios Karathanasis and political science student Nicolaos Mottas, has the scientific diligence of the project — the personal correspondence of Iakovos contains important information about the national issues of &lt;a href="w%3AGreece"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;, such as the &lt;a href="w%3ACyprus"&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMacedonian"&gt;Macedonian&lt;/a&gt; and the northern &lt;a href="w%3AEpirus"&gt;Epirus&lt;/a&gt; issues.

A dynamic personality, the spiritual leader of the Greek Orthodox community in the United States from &lt;a href="w%3A1959"&gt;1959&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3A1996"&gt;1996&lt;/a&gt;, Iakovos, constructed relations with all the American presidents, from &lt;a href="w%3AHarry%20Truman"&gt;Harry Truman&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Clinton"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, and with various personalities from the Americas, such as minority leaders, with most famous being his friendship with &lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20Luther%20King%20Jr"&gt;Martin Luther King Jr&lt;/a&gt;. The personal correspondence of the Greek Orthodox leader contains letters between Iakovos and various United States presidents, including &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Fitzgerald%20Kennedy"&gt;John F. Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Nixon"&gt;Richard Nixon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARonald%20Reagan"&gt;Ronald Reagan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20H.%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George H. W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;, and with other political personalities — ministers, ambassadors, &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; officials and former Greek Prime Ministers, including &lt;a href="w%3AConstantine%20Caramanlis"&gt;Constantine Caramanlis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAndreas%20Papandreou"&gt;Andreas Papandreou&lt;/a&gt;. According to professor Angelopoulos, the two-volume publication will contain photocopies of the original correspondence documents and moreover a major text — written in by Angelopoulos in &lt;a href="w%3Agreek%20language"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; and translated into &lt;a href="w%3Aenglish%20language"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; by Nicolaos Mottas — which will summarize the essentians and meaning of Iakovos' correspondence, as well as its impact on the political, social and religious life of the Greek Orthodox Community in the United States of America and on Greek-American relations.

The supervisor of the project, professor Athanasios Angelopoulos, stated that Archbishop Iakovos' personal correspondence will be published in 2006. The publication, which will be prefaced by the Archbishop of &lt;a href="w%3AAthens"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt; and All Greece, Archbishop &lt;a href="w%3AChristodoulos"&gt;Christodoulos&lt;/a&gt;, will be presented in Thessaloniki, Athens, and possibly to the Greek Community in the United States.

During a press conference on Tuesday, &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; called on veteran White House reporter &lt;a href="w%3AHelen%20Thomas"&gt;Helen Thomas&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in three years. She asked, "... your decision to invade Iraq has caused the deaths of thousands of Americans and Iraqis, wounds of Americans and Iraqis for a lifetime. Every reason given, publicly at least, has turned out not to be true. My question is, why did you really want to go to war?"

Bush replied, "And when [Saddam Hussein] chose to deny inspectors, when he chose not to disclose, then I had the difficult decision to make to remove him. And we did, and the world is safer for it."

The exchange has provoked extreme responses in the blogosphere, with conservative commentators like &lt;a href="w%3AFred%20Barnes%20%28journalist%29"&gt;Fred Barnes&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AFox%20News"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt; portraying Helen Thomas as being "unprofessional" and "improper" in "accusing the President."

Barnes argued, "Reporters aren't supposed to fire accusations at the President or anybody else they're interrogating, and that was wrong." He pointed out that Helen Thomas is an outspoken critic of the war in Iraq and the Presidency of George W. Bush. Fox News reporter &lt;a href="w%3ABrit%20Hume"&gt;Brit Hume&lt;/a&gt; said of Thomas, "She has an agenda, period, and always has had an agenda of sorts." Conservative commentators mostly agreed that President Bush "got the better of the exchange."

Liberal commentators like &lt;a href="w%3AJosh%20Marshall"&gt;Josh Marshall&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3ATalking%20Points%20Memo"&gt;Talking Points Memo&lt;/a&gt; focused on the President's response, saying, "Of course, that's not what happened. [...] We got the resolution passed. Saddam called our bluff and allowed the inspectors in. President Bush pressed ahead with the invasion."
He added "His lies are so blatant that I must constantly check myself so as not to assume that he is simply delusional or has blocked out whole chains of events from the past."

&lt;a href="Time%20%28magazine%29"&gt;♡❤Time♡❤ magazine&lt;/a&gt; has reported that the &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; military is investigating allegations of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Marine%20Corps"&gt;United States Marines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; killing civilians in response to the death of a U.S. Marine. The Marine was killed when a roadside &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="wikt%3Aimprovised%20explosive%20device"&gt;improvised explosive device&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; detonated near his convoy. His fellow Marines are alleged to have entered homes in a western &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;i town and shot and killed fifteen members of two families in retaliation, including a three-year-old girl.

♡❤Time♡❤ claims to have a videotape showing the results of the Marines' assault, describing it as "graphic documentation," but has stated that the evidence is inconclusive; it does not prove the guilt of the Marines involved. The military's own reconstruction of events, as well as the eyewitness accounts of residents whom Time interviewed, portrays a violent response by a group of U.S. Marines who believed they were under fire and had lost one of their own.

Last week the U.S. military announced that &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANaval%20Criminal%20Investigative%20Service"&gt;Naval Criminal Investigative Service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (NCIS) has been handed the matter to determine whether the troops deliberately targeted civilians and broke the laws of war. Military Officials initially indicated that 15 Iraqi civilians had died when gunmen attacked a convoy with small arms fire, prompting the Marines to return fire. U.S. Marines have also claimed that the civilians were used as shields by insurgents and that the fault lies with the insurgents.

Relatives of the victims have been paid USD $2,500 for each of the 15 dead civilians by the United States.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
The city's Common Council met in Council Chambers today with a full agenda. Among the items in the agenda was the Elmwood Village Hotel proposal.

The Elmwood Village Hotel is a proposed hotel by Savarino Construction Services Corporation and is designed by architect Karl Frizlen of the Frizlen Group. It is to be placed on the corner of Elmwood and Forest Avenues in Buffalo and will require the demolition of at least five properties (1109-1121 Elmwood).

During the hour-and-a-half meeting, the Common Council approved the hotel proposal. The entire voting process for the proposal took less than two minutes, and the public was not allowed to speak. The Council voted unanimously in support of the proposal; however, the city's Planning Board must also approve the proposal. The Board will meet on Tuesday, March 28, 2006 at 8:00 a.m. on the 9th floor of City Hall, room 902.

The approval allows for the rezoning of all five properties, including 605 Forest, to a "special development plan," or a C-2 zone. 

"There is a 'special development plan' in front of the council, which changes only one thing about the zoning. It allows one permitted use &amp;mdash; for just a hotel. The rest of the zoning remains as it is under the current Elmwood Business District zoning. 605 and 607 Forest are not required for the project. They are not part of the footprint for the project. Let me answer this question again. This is on the record, in council: 605 needs to be rezoned in order to facilitate the project because of the sideyard requirement. Anything in C-2 is excluded besides the hotel. So we've taken the C-2 and included the hotel as a permitted use, and excluded everything else, and everything else remains the same," Eva Hassett, Vice President of Savarino Consrtruction, said to ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ during a public meeting on March 16, 2006.

However, during the same meeting, Pano Georgiadis, owner of 605 Forest and owner of Pano's Restaurant on Elmwood, threatened to "sue" Savarino Construction saying, "If you try to get a variance to change the code, I will sue you. This is my home, number one."

Savarino Construction hopes to break ground this Summer.

<h3>Residents and business owners will still fight</h3>
Despite the Council's approval, organizers have scheduled another protest that will be held this Saturday, March 25, 2006 at 2:00 p.m. on Forest and Elmwood.

Some citizens are even considering legal action and are considering an "injunction in State Supreme Court," going "&lt;a href="w%3Apro%20se"&gt;pro se&lt;/a&gt;, meaning I am going to present the case myself," said Clarence Carnahan, a concerned citizen and local business owner who is opposed to the hotel, to ♡❤Wikinews.♡❤

Carnahan wrote a "notice of cease and desist" which was also presented to the Council at today's meeting.

Patty Morris, co-owner of Don Apparel with Nancy Pollina, said, "We are going to fight the good fight to the bitter end, but we cannot afford it [legal action]. Now it's a legal matter, and it's in the hands of the law, and I know there are some people very interested in hiring a lawyer."

Nancy Pollina says that she is "looking into a defense fund" and is currently talking to lawyers.

An aiplane from the Patrulla Aerea (Air Patrol) crashed in Mosquera, &lt;a href="w%3ANari%C3%B1o%20Department"&gt;Nariño&lt;/a&gt;, a small and remote town in the south west part of &lt;a href="w%3AColombia"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;. Immediately after takeoff, the plane, a &lt;a href="w%3ACessna"&gt;Cessna&lt;/a&gt;, was pushed by heavy crosswind, and crashed into a house, killing a boy, his mother and a doctor on board. The pilot, Rafael Arenas, aged 42, who had been working for 10 years on the Air Patrol, survived with burns on 90% of his body, but died later in the Intensive Care unit of El Valle Universitary hospital.

The Air Patrol is a Colombian ONG, created and staffed by pilots and doctors to bring medical care to people in the most abandoned regions of the country.

Less than a week after it was first banned and then cleared for screening in the U.K., an Australian tourism ad featuring a bikini-clad girl asking prospective tourists "Where the Bloody Hell are you?" has been banned in Canada. Ironically, it wasn't the controversial question — a line described as "warm, friendly and inviting" — that got the ad banned, but its opening: "We've poured you a beer." This line was ruled unacceptable by the Canadian regulator, as it refers to an unbranded beer.

Australian Tourism Minister Fran Bailey was "quite astonished" by the move but has thanked the Canadian government for providing free publicity for the ad, saying, "As far as this particular Canadian regulator is concerned, I'd love him to come out here and I'll buy him a beer and say thank-you."

&lt;a href="Microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; plans to delay the consumer versions of its next &lt;a href="w%3Aoperating%20system"&gt;operating system&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AWindows%20Vista"&gt;Windows Vista&lt;/a&gt;. Originally due out by the end of 2006, Windows Vista Home Basic, Home Premium, and Ultimate editions now have a release target of January 2007. Business editions will continue to be released in November 2006. Two different reasons for this have been given in interviews; the first reason being a six-week delay in completing security related work on the operating system and the second reason is that, as a result of this delay, computer hardware manufacturers and resellers will generally not have enough time to prepare for a holiday 2006 launch. Analysts have said this could put some computer manufacturers into turmoil, though a number of the largest resellers of &lt;a href="w%3AWindows%20XP"&gt;Windows XP&lt;/a&gt; have made public statements supporting Microsoft's decision to delay the consumer release of Vista to January.

Currently, Windows XP has been the longest-current operating system from Microsoft, debuting in 2001.

At approximately 00:26 hrs, on Wednesday, March 22, the British Columbia ferry MV Queen of the North hit a rock near &lt;a href="w%3AGil%20Island"&gt;Gil Island&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AWright%20Sound"&gt;Wright Sound&lt;/a&gt;, off the coast of British Columbia, Canada, 75 from the start of ship's schedule journey from Prince Rupert to Port Hardy on the Northern tip of Vancouver Island&lt;a href="w%3APort%20Hardy"&gt;Port Hardy&lt;/a&gt;. The ship missed a course change and ran agroung off Gil Island. It took about an hour for the ferry to sink, giving passengers time to get out. The vessel was carrying 101 passengers and crew, and all but 2 were accounted for. Thanks to quick-response of nearby aboriginal fishing villager of Hartley Bay, and the CCGS Sir Wiflrid Laurier. Survivors were quickly fetched from the Queen of the North's lifeboat and brought to Hartley Bay and onboard the coast Guard ship, and eventually back to Prince Rupert onboard the Sir Wilfrid Laurier. &lt;a href="w%3AHartley%20Bay"&gt;Hartley Bay&lt;/a&gt;. 

The Queen of the North, is (apx) 9,000 gross ton, motor driven vessel, built in Germany in 1969. The Queen of the North had been on this 15 hrs, 274 nautical mile ferry run since late May 1980. In the summer and on relief work, her smaller sister ship, the Queen of Prince Rupert also performs that run.

EU Transport Commissioner Jacques Barrot on Wednesday banned 92 airlines, some planes of which he described as "flying coffins," from landing at European airports, declaring them unsafe by international standards. 

"This blacklist will keep dubious airlines out of Europe," Barrot said. "It will also make sure that all airlines operating in Europe's skies meet the highest safety standards."

The armed Basque separatist organisation "&lt;a href="w%3AETA"&gt;ETA&lt;/a&gt;" (Euskadi Ta Askatasuna) has announced a permanent &lt;a href="w%3Acease-fire"&gt;cease-fire&lt;/a&gt; as of Friday 24th March 2006. A video release by the organization shows three people seated at a table in front the ETA emblem, faces covered with masks and wearing Basque berets. The video was broadcast on Spanish national television and distributed to local Basque media outlets. 

ETA, Western Europe's most active separatist group, seek to create an independent state covering Spain's northern &lt;a href="w%3ABasque%20Country"&gt;Basque Country&lt;/a&gt; and parts of south-western France. The group broke two ceasefires in the 1990s.

For over three decades the armed organisation has waged a violent campaign for independence for the seven regions in northern &lt;a href="w%3ASpain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; and south-west &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="w%3ABasque%20separatists"&gt;Basque separatists&lt;/a&gt; claim as their own. ETA, whose name stands for Basque Homeland and Freedom, originated in the 1960s as a student resistance movement bitterly opposed to General Franco's repressive military dictatorship.

ETA is considered by Spain, France, the European Union and the United States to be a terrorist organization, with more than eight hundred killings attributed to it.

A permanent end to hostilities by ETA was a condition set by the Socialist Government of Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJose%20Luis%20Rodriguez%20Zapatero"&gt;Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero&lt;/a&gt; for beginning negotiations with the organisation.

<h2>Edited text of ETA cease-fire statement</h2>
♡❤(Translated/edited from Spanish by Wikinews)♡❤

Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (ETA) has decided to declare a permanent cease-fire from 00:00 AM on the 24 of March 2006. 

♡❤♡Reflection of ETA♡❤♡ 

The objective of this decision is to impel democratic process in Basque Country so that by means of dialogue, negotiation and agreement, Basque can make the necessary political change. 

It is necessary to construct a democratic framework for Basque Country, recognizing the rights that Basque corresponds to, and to assure the potential development all political options. At the end of that process the citizens and Basque citizens should have their right to speak and the ability to make decision on their future - enabling democratic solutions to the conflict. 

ETA considers that it corresponds to all the Basque agents to develop this process and to adopt the agreements corresponding to the future of Basque Country, considering their plurality and totality. The Spanish and French States must recognize the results of this democratic process, without interference or limitation. The decision that Basque citizens we adopt for our future will have to be respected. 

♡❤♡Call of ETA♡❤♡ 

We must assume responsibilities, to construct the democratic solutions that Basque needs. It is the moment for making decisions from openwork, and dialogue of the facts. ETA makes a call to the authorities of Spain and France to respond positively to this new situation; and so that they do not set up obstacles to the democratic process, leaving aside repression and showing the will to give a negotiated exit to the conflict. 

Finally, we make a call to the citizens and Basque citizens in general and to the militants of the Abertzale Left, so that they are implied in this process.

♡❤♡Commitment of ETA♡❤♡ 

ETA has shown desire and willingness, from an open process until the end, and thus to obtain to a true democratic situation for Basque country, surpassing the conflict of long years and constructing a peace based on justice. 

We reaffirmed commitment to take agreed steps in to that will and continuing fighting until obtaining the rights of Euskal Herria the future. The overcoming of the conflict, here and now, is possible. 

That is the desire and the will of ETA. - In Euskal Herria (Basque Country), March 2006 - Euskadi Ta Askatasuna

(This is a translation of the French Wikinews article: &lt;a href="http%3A//fr.wikinews.org/wiki/Manifestation_contre_le_CPE_%25C3%25A0_Paris"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Manifestation contre le CPE à Paris&lt;/i&gt;)

<h2>Demonstration</h2>

A demonstration was planned for two p.m. [local time and UTC, Saturday, March 18], departing from the Place Denfert-Rochereau in &lt;a href="w%3AParis"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;. Everyone had set out by three p.m., the crowd being compact.

Retired people, post-highschool students, highschool students and employees all gathered to protest against the government's bill establishing the &lt;a href="w%3AContrat%20premi%C3%A8re%20embauche"&gt;"Contrat Première Embauche&lt;/a&gt;," — First Employment Contract.

A security service provided by the unions maintained order more or less well. Even so, an impressive body of very visible police sought to prevent any excess.

The first demonstrators arrived about five p.m. at the Place de la Nation, in a festive atmosphere. 
In the procession were musicians, grimy youths and colorful banners. Along the edges of the procession and at the Place de la Nation could even be seen sellers of sandwiches and drinks.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
<h2>Excesses</h2>

Toward six p.m., some hooded youths began to confront the forces of order massed at the edges of the Place de la Nation. They threw bottles and pyrotechnical devices and burned a car. The confrontation, which lasted at least until eight p.m., produced one serious injury — a SUD-PTT union member, who it seems was struck by members of the &lt;a href="w%3ACompagnies%20r%C3%A9publicaines%20de%20s%C3%A9curit%C3%A9"&gt;CRS&lt;/a&gt; security force.
Some demonstrators at first sought to place themselves between the ruffians and the police, but they had to give it up, faced with the barrage of bottles.

After the automobile fire, around seven p.m., the mobile &lt;a href="w%3AGendarmerie%20nationale"&gt;gendarmes&lt;/a&gt; charged, in order to establish a security perimeter around the vehicle on fire, to permit the firemen to extinguish it. In view of the small distance that separated the "forces of order" from the brigands when they burned the car, one can ask why the mobile gendarmes did not try to prevent this act of gratuitous vandalism.

The police charged several times and threw tear gas. By eight p.m., the confrontations still continued, and a mobile gendarme said that the objective was to make the demonstrators leave the Place de la Nation.

A strange impression is felt when this sort of occurrence breaks out in a demonstration that was until then well-mannered. It is like thunder from a blue sky. 
The crowd suddenly opened, and the hooligans were there, ready to come unglued, the crowd of demonstrators transforming themselves into rubberneckers around the protagonists of the confrontation.

Once again, a few &lt;i&gt;provocateurs,&lt;/i&gt; undoubtedly fewer than about thirty, caused a movement of several tens of thousands of people to get out of hand.

In one of the most contentious &lt;a href="w%3ADemocrat"&gt;Democratic&lt;/a&gt; primary races of the season, Iraqi war veteran &lt;a href="w%3ATammy%20Duckworth"&gt;Tammy Duckworth&lt;/a&gt; garnered 44% of the vote in the 6th Illinois congressional district, beating out &lt;a href="w%3AChristine%20Cegalis"&gt;Christine Cegalis&lt;/a&gt; (40%) and Lindy Scott (16%). Duckworth's victory earns her a spot in the race against &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; state Senator Peter Roskam, who won the Republican nomination to replace retiring Congressman &lt;a href="w%3AHenry%20Hyde"&gt;Henry Hyde&lt;/a&gt;. 

Cegalis ran for the seat in 2004, garnering 44% of the vote, the best achieved by a Democrat against Hyde. Working off of momentum gathered in that race, she continued to increase her grassroots organization and her Internet campaigning to gain support from Democrats across the nation. Cegalis, a software engineer, was running unopposed for the nomination until Duckworth joined the race in December. Supported by the Democratic establishment, Duckworth quickly out-fundraised her opponents, receiving support from prominent Democrats such as &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Kerry"&gt;John Kerry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, Rahm Emmanual, and &lt;a href="w%3ABarack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt;. 

The race became strongly contested between self-proclaimed &lt;a href="w%3Aprogressive"&gt;progressive&lt;/a&gt; activists supporting Cegalis and Democrats who preferred to work with the party candidate. Duckworth, who lost her legs in Iraq in 2004, received a strong showing of support from outside the district, including large fundraisers in New York and Chicago. 

Scott, a former pastor of an evangelical church in Des Plains, attempted to paint the race in religious terms. His campaign was run on the principle that he could win votes through his moderate, religious views, which he said would attract Republican voters in the district.

The president of the organization for the construction of the new &lt;a href="w%3AAcropolis%2C%20Athens"&gt;Acropolis&lt;/a&gt; Museum, professor Dimitrios Pandermalis, announced that the Museum will be ready to operate as an exhibition center for archaeological treasures in &lt;a href="w%3A2007"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;. In response to this statement, the &lt;a href="w%3AGreek"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; government re-issued demands regarding the subject of the Parthenon Marbles' restoration to &lt;a href="w%3AGreece"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingon"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;.

After visiting the construction site, Greek Culture Minister George Voulgarakis reiterated yesterday that the new &lt;a href="w%3AAthens"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Amuseum"&gt;museum&lt;/a&gt; would be ready to receive visitors by the end of next year.

The new Acropolis Museum, which is located in the area of &lt;a href="w%3AMakriyannis"&gt;Makriyannis&lt;/a&gt;, just a few metres away from the rock of the Acropolis, will cover an area of about 23,000 sqm. According to the &lt;a href="w%3AGreek%20Ministry%20of%20Culture"&gt;Greek Ministry of Culture&lt;/a&gt;, the whole project would cost 129 million &lt;a href="w%3Aeuros"&gt;euros&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3AParthenon%20Marbles"&gt;Parthenon Marbles&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; also known as the Elgin Marbles &amp;mdash; are currently located in a specific hall in the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Museum"&gt;British Museum&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;. The demand from the side of the Greek government as well as from Greek or non-Greek organizations and British celebrities like &lt;a href="w%3ASean%20Connery"&gt;Sean Connery&lt;/a&gt; for the restoration of the marbles &amp;mdash; a demand which was an idea of the former Greek Culture Minister and actress &lt;a href="w%3AMelina%20Mercouri"&gt;Melina Mercouri&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; didn't have any result until today due to the denial from the side of the British Museum administration.

The new book &lt;i&gt;Game of Shadows: &lt;a href="w%3ABarry%20Bonds"&gt;Barry Bonds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABALCO"&gt;BALCO&lt;/a&gt;, and the Steroids Scandal that Rocked Professional Sports&lt;/i&gt;, by Mark Fainaru-Wada and Lance Williams of The San Francisco Chronicle, is being released today. The authors not only implicate professional baseball celebrity Barry Bonds in the use of performance-enhancing drugs, but also say &lt;a href="w%3AGary%20Sheffield"&gt;Gary Sheffield&lt;/a&gt; received human growth hormone and testosterone from &lt;a href="w%3AGreg%20Anderson%20%28trainer%29"&gt;Greg Anderson&lt;/a&gt;, Bonds's personal trainer. 

The book goes on to claim that &lt;a href="w%3AJason%20Giambi"&gt;Jason Giambi&lt;/a&gt; also took performance-enhancing drugs from Anderson. Bonds continues to insist that he did not realize his trainer was giving him steriods. He claimed in his grand jury testimony that he thought he was receiving flaxseed oil and an arthritis salve. Sheffield's response to the claims was quite simple: when asked if the allegations made against him were true, his response was "Nope."

Despite the book's accusations of Sheffield and Giambi, it centers around Bonds and the founder of the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative or BALCO, Victor Conte Jr. Conte is currently serving four months in prison for distribution of steriods and money laundering. It appears that the steroid controversy concerning Bonds will only intensify as he continues to march on towards the career home runs record, one of baseball's most sacred records.

<h1>42 West Papuan asylum seekers get temporary Australian visas</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=42%20West%20Papuan%20asylum%20seekers%20get%20temporary%20Australian%20visas&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The Australian government has granted temporary visas to 42 of the 43 &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Papua"&gt;West Papuan&lt;/a&gt; asylum seekers who arrived by boat in January. The group accuse the Indonesian military of "conducting genocide in their homeland." The 36 adults and seven children spent five days at sea in a traditional outrigger boat before arriving in far north Queensland's Cape York. They have been since been detained under &lt;a href="w%3AMandatory%20detention%20in%20Australia"&gt;Australia's Mandatory Detention&lt;/a&gt; policy.

&lt;a href="w%3AImmigration%20Minister%20Amanda%20Vanstone"&gt;Immigration Minister Amanda Vanstone&lt;/a&gt; said the 42 West Papuans have been given temporary protection visas (TPV). "These people have completed their medical and character checks and will be moved into the community," she said. Most of the group are being relocated by private jet from Australia's remote &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20immigration%20detention%20facilities"&gt;immigration detention&lt;/a&gt; centre on &lt;a href="w%3AChristmas%20Island"&gt;Christmas Island&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;. Senator Vanstone said a decision was still pending on one of the asylum seekers, as there were further specific case issues to be addressed. 

However, the &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesian%20government"&gt;Indonesian government&lt;/a&gt; says the refugees should be sent back. Indonesia's &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20Susilo%20Bambang%20Yudhoyono"&gt;President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono&lt;/a&gt; has told &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20John%20Howard"&gt;Prime Minister John Howard&lt;/a&gt; that the group should not be given political asylum. He assures that they would not be prosecuted. Last month, Indonesia's ambassador, Hamzah Thayeb, warned that Australia's relationship with Indonesia would be affected if the Papuans were granted asylum.

A spokesman for &lt;a href="w%3AForeign%20Minister%20Alexander%20Downer"&gt;Foreign Minister Alexander Downer&lt;/a&gt; dismissed suggestions that the decision would cause a rift between Australia and Jakarta. "We've got an excellent bilateral relationship with Indonesia and we wouldn't expect that any particular issue is going to bring that into question," he said. Mr Downer personally informed his Indonesian counterpart, Hassan Wirajuda, of the decision. "It's a matter of some significance between our two countries," said Mr Downer.

Indonesia has insisted that there are no human rights abuses in Papua. Djoko Susilo, a member of Indonesia's parliamentary foreign affairs commission, labelled the decision "an unfriendly gesture by the Australian Government."

Since their arrival, the 43 West Papuans have accused the Indonesian military of "genocide in their homeland," taken over by Indonesia in the 1960s after a widely disputed independence referendum.
Herman Wainggai, who spoke for the asylum-seekers, thanked the Australian Government and people for a fair and just decision. "We were threatened in an extremely dangerous position ... We had to flee to Australia from the intimidation of the killing and the persecution inflicted by Indonesian authorities against us," he said. 

"We trust that Indonesia will act with maturity and see that the situation in West Papua is very serious and one which must be dealt with peacefully and with humanity, not by violent means," he said. 

The Indonesian House of Representatives (DPR) has denounced the Australian government's decision, urging the government to send a formal protest note to the Australian government over the visas and political asylum granted to the 42 Indonesian citizens. "We question the decision to grant visas and political asylum at a time when the security situation in Papua province is tense," said member of the House Commission I for defence, foreign and information affairs Effendy Mara Sakti, of the Indonesian Democratic Party-Struggle (PDIP).

Another House Commission member, Yudy Chrisnandy of the Golkar Party, said the granting of political asylum and temporary visas was unethical and could disrupt relations between the two countries. 

Amnesty International has expressed particular concern about human rights violations in Papua, but welcomed the decision. "While welcoming today's decision ... Amnesty now encourages the government to consider the plight of the Papuan refugees, as under Australia's temporary protection regime the refugees now face isolation from their families left behind and face uncertainty about their future," the organisation said in a statement. Amnesty reports of "extrajudicial executions, 'disappearances,' torture, ill-treatment and arbitrary detentions in Papua Province." 

Australian Greens Senator Kerry Nettle also welcomed the decision. "The situation in West Papua is clearly very dangerous for those who assert their right to self-determination, so the decision to grant protection visas is a good one," Senator Nettle said. 

West Papua have been seeking sovereignty since the United Nations handed the province to Indonesia in 1969. A spokesman for the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.freewestpapua.com"&gt;Free West Papua Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, Nick Chesterfield, said the decision highlights the dire situation. "What this clearly demonstrates is that the world needs to wake up to what is happening in West Papua and start to actively look at ways of ending the sickening violence that the Indonesian military continues to inflict on the people of West Papua," Mr Chesterfield said. 

"Rather than being isolated and locked up thousands of miles away on Christmas Island, these very courageous individuals can receive the support they deserve from the local community. This decision also means Australians will be able to hear first hand about the atrocities and escalating human right abuses that are unfolding in one of our closest neighbouring countries," said Mr Chesterfield. 

Meanwhile, the "Morning Star" flag of West Papua was raised in Marrickville, New South Wales, by Senator Nettle and the Mayor of Marrickville, Sam Byrne. The flag, officially unrecognised by Indonesia in the West Papuan region, was raised to "urge city citizens to support self-determination for the West Papuans people." 

Uniting Church minister Reverend John Barr, who recently returned from the area, warned of an "intensification of violence" and also recounted demands from protesters to have the Freeport mine and the Indonesian government held responsible for despoiling the Papuan environment. "We have heard one student was shot dead and many are badly wounded. I could hear people yelling and fleeing as my contact spoke to me on the phone from the grounds of the theological seminary," he said in a statement.

<h2>Media ban</h2>
The Jakarta Foreign Correspondents Club has stated concern that no foreign journalist has had official access to Papua in the past eighteen months. In that period there has been "a significant build-up of troops in Papua with reports of widespread displacement of civilians, arson, and arbitrary detention in the central highlands region." 

Last week, Indonesian media showed police shooting directly at students on local university grounds. Authorities have not released details of casualties among the demonstrators. "I can't tell you exactly how many were shot," says Hans Magel. "In such traumatic circumstances, we ourselves are finding it difficult gathering casualty figures. The latest information we have is that 22 were seriously injured."

Indonesia has effectively maintained a ban on access to Papua for many foreign organisations since 2003. Indonesia’s Minister of Defense, Juwono Sudarsono, said in February that the government will "maintain curbs on foreign media" reporting from Papua. He is quoted as saying, "We feel that our unity and cohesion are being threatened by the presence of foreign intrusion and concerns so there is a balance between international concerns and sovereignty that we want to strike very peacefully." 

Minister Sudarsono also stated that the curbs should "extend to foreign nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and churches, whom he thought might create conflict in the province by encouraging Papuans to campaign on issues of human rights." He stated that he feared reporters could be "used as a platform" by Papuans to publicize the alleged abuses. 

Ken Roth, Executive Director of &lt;a href="Human%20Rights%20Watch"&gt;Human Rights Watch&lt;/a&gt;, is alarmed at efforts by the Indonesian government to ban or limit press coverage of human rights violations and other issues in Papua. In a letter to President Yudhoyono, Roth urged the Indonesian government to respect press freedom and to allow full press coverage of all issues affecting the province. 

Senior Indonesian ministers have vehemently denied that the people of West Papua are being repressed.

A hostage situation in the private mental clinic Castalia, in the suburb of &lt;a href="w%3AGlyfada"&gt;Glyfada&lt;/a&gt;, south &lt;a href="w%3AAthens"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt;, has ended with the arrest of a 26 year old man. The man had locked himself up along with three hostages in the Accounts Department, on the first floor of the building. 

According to &lt;a href="w%3AGreek"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Apolice"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; the man, who was armed, has mental problems and is a drug addict. His demands were unknown to the police, as he did not communicate them to the police negotiators. The situation in the Castalia clinic prompted the Greek Minister of Public Order to cancel his scheduled meetings in order to supervise personally the rescue operation.

&lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thailand's&lt;/a&gt; People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) has petitioned the country's Election Commission to disqualify caretaker Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AThaksin%20Shinawatra"&gt;Thaksin Shinawatra&lt;/a&gt; from the upcoming April 2 election and to postpone it, to bring an end to the current political crisis. According to the &lt;a href="w%3ABangkok%20Post"&gt;Bangkok Post&lt;/a&gt;, approximately 1,000 PAD protesters rallied outside the election commission's headquarters to mark delivery of the petition.

Parinya Thewanarumitkul, a law lecturer at Thammasat University, claimed at a Thai Journalists Association forum that he had evidence that the PM had abused his position by using government resources to aid in the organisation of a March 3 rally of &lt;a href="w%3AThai%20Rak%20Thai"&gt;Thai Rak Thai&lt;/a&gt; supporters. In addition, Parinya expressed doubt that the required 500 MPs would be returned, due to the main opposition party election boycott and the requirement for 20% of the eligible electorate to vote for a candidate, even when the candidate stands unopposed.

Thailand's Democrats, the current main opposition party, who are boycotting the April 2 election, raised doubts over the validity of a number of Thai Rak Thai candidates' listings. Calling for the Election Commission to investigate these allegations, Pichai Rattanadilok na Phuket of the National Institute of Development Administration also highlighted the 46 constituencies where the Prime Minister's party stands unopposed, viewing vote buying as a possibility in these areas.

According to Democrat claims, over 200 people who applied to be on ballots failed to meet the requirement to have maintained party membership for 90 days prior to the announcement of the election. It isn't just the candidates of smaller parties that have caught the eye of the Democrat panel examining candidate credentials. They claim that at least three of the Thai Rak Thai candidates should be disenfranchised due to having not voted during the 2005 election. The three accused — including the party's deputy leader — dispute the claim that they failed to vote. Party deputy Somchai Sunthornvat claimed it was a person with the same name who had failed to vote, and threatened to sue the Democrat party for making the allegation.

While PAD protesters demonstrated away from Government House, the beleaguered PM returned unnanounced from his election campaigning in the country's northeast. In addition to his having been continuingly called upon leave office, his key privatisation policies had been dealt a serious blow by the ruling that the privatisation of the state-owned power company &lt;a href="w%3AEGAT"&gt;EGAT&lt;/a&gt; was unlawful.

Judges overturned two royal decrees that had been the foundation of the plan for Thailand's largest ever IPO. Supporters of the eleven civic groups that had filed the petition with the court greeted the decision with cheers. Mention of conflicts of interest in the privatisation process adds fuel to the accusations of anti-Thaksin groups, who accuse the PM of leading a government that indulges in cronyism.

Three men, James Loney, 41, and Harmeet Singh Sooden, 32, both from Canada, and Norman Kember, 74, of Britain were rescued today by British SAS and Canadian JTF2 Special Forces in Western Baghdad. Major General Rick Lynch, a spokesman for the US military commented on how the rescue was initiated: “We detained two suspects this morning, the detainees gave us intelligence that led us to the rescue of the three hostages.” 

The three men are part of a Chicago based pacifist group entitled Christian Peacemaker Teams. The organization opposes the presence of foreign troops in Iraq and has members in Iraq to investigate detainee abuse by coalition forces. A fourth member of their group, Tom Fox, an American, was found shot and killed in Baghdad on March 10th.

The activists had been held since November 26th, 2005. The group Swords of Righteousness Brigades claimed responsibility for the kidnapping. After their rescue, both Canadians required medical attention, according to British Foreign minister Jack Straw.

On March 15, Congressman &lt;a href="w%3AHenry%20Waxman"&gt;Henry Waxman&lt;/a&gt; (D-CA) sent a letter to President Bush's White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card, accusing Bush of signing a law that did not pass the &lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;.

The bill in question is called the &lt;a href="w%3ADeficit%20Reduction%20Omnibus%20Reconciliation%20Act%20of%202005"&gt;Deficit Reduction Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 2005&lt;/a&gt;. Before a bill is passed into law the same version needs to be approved by both the House and the Senate.

Waxman cited a $2 billion spending difference over the next 5 years between the conflicting versions of the bill.

Waxman also stated his understanding that either the Speaker of the House or his staff called the White House to inform President Bush of the situation before signing the bill. Another letter was written March 22 by House Minority Leader &lt;a href="w%3ANancy%20Pelosi"&gt;Nancy Pelosi&lt;/a&gt; and Congressman Waxman asking the White House to respond.

The full text of the letter can be found in the sources section below.

Canadian news agency the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Press"&gt;Canadian Press&lt;/a&gt; (CP) is speculating that &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Forces"&gt;Canadian Forces&lt;/a&gt; soldiers, specifically the elite &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20special%20forces"&gt;Joint Task Force 2&lt;/a&gt; unit, may have been involved in the rescue of two Canadian hostages in &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Loney"&gt;James Loney&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AHarmeet%20Singh%20Sooden"&gt;Harmeet Singh Sooden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20Peacemaker%20Team"&gt;Christian Peacemaker Team&lt;/a&gt; members both &lt;a href="w%3A2005-2006%20Christian%20Peacemaker%20hostage%20crisis"&gt;held hostage there&lt;/a&gt; since November 2005.

Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt; has refused to answer questions about whether these troops were involved. It would be significant to Canadians if their troops were involved in Iraq, as Canada previously refused to contribute troops to the US-led invasion of Iraq.

Two explosions were heard in the city of &lt;a href="w%3ALa%20Paz"&gt;La Paz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABolivia"&gt;Bolivia&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday night, March 22 and in the early morning Wednesday, March 23. The first occurred at the Linares Motel, at 21:50 (01:50 UTC), and left two people dead and four injured. The second explosion occurred at 01:45 (05:45 UTC) at the Hotel Riosinhio II, less than a block from the La Paz bus terminal, injuring two people.

Hours later, two suspects in the crime were arrested by the police in the city of &lt;a href="w%3AEl%20Alto"&gt;El Alto&lt;/a&gt;. They were American Claudio Lestat, approximately 30 years old (25 according to some sources) and his partner, &lt;a href="w%3AUruguay"&gt;Uruguayan&lt;/a&gt; Alda Ribeiros, of 35 years (40 according to other sources). Dynamite was used in both explosions, according to government attorney Jorge Gutiérrez.

President Evo Morales indicated that the promoters of the incidents were "industrialists" and "oligarchists" who, "using external agents", claimed to halt the reforms that have been happening in Bolivia. He also suggested that the United States could be behind the incidents: "Is there an effort against terrorism from the government of the United States, or did they send North Americans to commit terrorism in Bolivia?" Despite the accusations, the United States embassy in La Paz announced its cooperation. 

However, authorities have not ruled out religious motives, because Lestat is a self-proclaimed "minister of pagan rites". Police also announced that the Chilean consulate in the Bolivian capital was also a target, to be attacked on Saturday the 25th.

Names and ages of the victims of the explosions are: Marlene Patzi Tapia (26), Cristian López (26), Alva Natividad Heredia (44), and Jessica Wilson (24), the last from the United States. Also affected were Marco Antonio Romero Galindo (20), Iván Quiroga (27), Elizabeth de Quiroga (44) and Ximena Vargas (18).

Virologists think that the reason the &lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt; strain of &lt;a href="w%3AAvian%20influenza"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt; has poor ability to spread between humans is that the infection does not cause coughing or sneezing.

&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt; scientists, led by Professor Yoshihiro Kawaoka at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, found that avian influenza and human influenza viruses infect different tissues in the respiratory tract. Another group of scientists, based at the University of Rotterdam, has also published similar results.

Professor Kawaoka's team discovered that bird flu tends to be found among &lt;a href="w%3AAlveoli"&gt;alveoli&lt;/a&gt; deep in the lungs. Human flu is instead most prevalent in the mucous lining of the nose and sinuses, as well as the throat, windpipe and bronchi.

Human flu infects parts of the respiratory system that cause coughing and sneezing. When an infected person coughs or sneezes, tiny droplets containing the virus are released into the air, which other humans can inhale, becoming infected. As bird flu infects the alveoli, it doesn't cause coughing or sneezing, and heavy exposure to the virus is required before it can get to the lungs.

Professor Kawaoka said, "For the viruses to be transmitted efficiently, they have to multiply in the upper portion of the respiratory system so that they can be transmitted by coughing and sneezing."

For H5N1 to be transmitted easily among humans, it would need to undergo multiple mutations, according to Professor Kawaoka.

"Certainly, multiple mutations need to be accumulated for the H5N1 to become a pandemic strain," he said.

These mutations would have to affect where the virus binds in the human body and affect the way in which it reproduces.

Currently only one strain of H5N1, A/Hong Kong/213/03, has shown the ability to latch onto cells in both the upper and lower parts of the human respiratory system.

♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AEncyclop%C3%A6dia%20Britannica"&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ has strongly criticised the scientific journal ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANature%20%28journal%29"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ for last year's investigation into the encyclopedia's accuracy compared to that of the open-source online encyclopedia, &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;. ♡❤Britannica♡❤ also called for a retraction of the article. ♡❤Nature♡❤ has rejected the accusations, saying that their comparison was fair and that they do not intend to retract their report.

In a 20-page response (titled "Fatally Flawed") to the report's findings that there was not a significant difference in accuracy between the two encyclopædias, Britannica wrote that 'Almost everything about the journal's investigation [...] was wrong and misleading.' The document goes on to call the investigation 'invalid', 'completely without merit' and 'careless'. Britannica also accused ♡❤Nature♡❤ of 'misrepresenting its own results'. The last 12 pages of this comprehensive rebuttal are responses to specific article criticisms, mainly consisting of differences of opinion on style and article composition, but some citing outright factual errors on ♡❤Nature♡❤♡s part.

In their response, ♡❤Nature♡❤ refused to reveal their original data for comparison, and commented that ♡❤Britannica♡❤ had raised their grievances in private some time ago, and then received no further correspondence until ♡❤Britannica♡❤♡s open letter of 22 March 2006. ♡❤Nature♡❤ notes that ♡❤Britannica♡❤ criticised 'less than half the points [their] reviewers raised', and states that the two encyclopædias were subject to the same treatment.

Wikipedia has been stigmatised as unreliable due to its open-source nature and a perceived problem with vandalism. The December 2005 study was seen at the time as a major boost to the credibility of Wikipedia. Jimmy Wales was notified by one of his team members, on 27 January 2006 that all corrections provided by ♡❤Nature♡❤ were in place. Recent changes to some of the Wikipedia editing policies have attempted to resolve some of the reliability issues raised.

Wikipedia has yet to comment.

&lt;a href="w%3APope%20Benedict%20XVI"&gt;Pope Benedict XVI&lt;/a&gt; elevated 15 men to &lt;a href="w%3ACollege%20of%20Cardinals"&gt;College of Cardinals&lt;/a&gt; today at an Ordinary Consistory, a ceremony in which the new Princes of the &lt;a href="w%3ARoman%20Catholic%20Church"&gt;Roman Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt; receive three-cornered hats of crimson, the color distinguishing their new office and signifying their willigness to shed blood to spread the Christian faith.

In addition to fulfilling vital roles as advisors to the &lt;a href="w%3APope"&gt;Pope&lt;/a&gt; and leaders at the highest administrative and pastoral roles of the Church, some Cardinals (those below age 80) also serve as electors in the &lt;a href="w%3AConclave"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt;, the means by which a new Pope is chosen.

A large explosion ripped through a research building of the École Nationale Supérieure de Chimie de Mulhouse (ENSCMu) in &lt;a href="w%3AMulhouse"&gt;Mulhouse&lt;/a&gt;, eastern France. Mulhouse's mayor, Jean-Marie Bockel, confirmed that the blast killed one person and injured another. Police declared Code Red, and the neighborhood was evacuated.

According to the French Press, TF1, the victim was in his forties and had worked at the institition for about a year. A young woman was seriously injured and about a dozen people received minor injuries, with two suffering from shock. 150 firefighters were on the scene. 

The ENSCMu is a technology college, with an enrollment of 8,000 and a 25-&lt;a href="w%3Ahectare"&gt;hectare&lt;/a&gt; campus near the town's centre. It is known for its museum of coloring agents (Musée des Colorants), which has about 2700 samples, mainly from the second part of the nineteenth century. The museum's database is available online &lt;a href="http%3A//www.enscmu.uha.fr/musee/colorants.php"&gt;in French&lt;/a&gt;.

The blast occurred at 11:25 GMT (12:25 local time). It is reported to have been heard two kilometres away and to have broken the windows of nearby buildings. The blast was followed by a fire that was contained by about 15:00 (local time).

The explosion's cause is not yet clear but it is believed to have happened in a ground-floor laboratory in an annex building constructed in 1977. The lab was apparently focused on industrial safety.

The &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20National%20Party"&gt;British National Party&lt;/a&gt;(BNP), a far-right political party failed to hold on to one of its seats on Bradford City Council, West Yorkshire, UK. The byelection was called after the incumbent BNP councillor, Angela Clark, stood down. BNP had won the seat in 2004 after it adapted an ongoing campaign against &lt;a href="w%3AGang"&gt;gangs&lt;/a&gt; grooming girls for sex. The BNP claimed white girls were being groomed by Asian men for sex. The original campaign was organised by Angela Sinfield, whose 13 year-old daughter was groomed by a gang which she pointed out contained white and Asian men. Sinfield joined the &lt;a href="w%3ALabour%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Labour Party&lt;/a&gt; last year and was its candidate for the Keighley West seat. She sensationally won the seat with 1819 votes over the BNP's 1216, a swing of 11.4 per cent from the BNP to Labour. The voter turnout was near general election levels, 58.8 per cent.Three BNP councillors remain on Bradford City Council, with two of them up for election in May.

Rev. Chester Przybylo has been accused in a civil law suit of molesting a 13-year-old boy almost 20 years ago, when he was serving at Holy Martyrs parish in Chicago.

The plaintiff said the abuse took place in the apartment of a friend of Rev. Przybylo and the rectory of Five Holy Martyrs, and continued for more than a year. Rev. Przybylo supposedly threatened to have the plaintiff's mother, a Polish immigrant, deported if he resisted.

The plaintiff says that he told a bishop and another pastor about the abuse, but he said, "I was yelled at and told to go to confession as if I sinned."

Rev. Chester Przybylo is currently the pastor at Shrine of Christ the King church in western Chicago, a conservative Catholic congregation which is not officially recognized by the Roman Catholic hierarchy.

Rev. Przybylo has denied the allegations.

Frank Ellis, a lecturer in Russian and Slavonic studies, also praised the book &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Bell%20Curve"&gt;♡❤The Bell Curve♡❤&lt;/a&gt;, citing a theory from it claiming black people are less intelligent than white people.

It is expected that disciplinary measures will take months, during which time Ellis remains an employee of the university. The Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2002 requires universities to promote racial equality.

Ellis spoke at the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Renaissance%20%28magazine%29"&gt;American Renaissance&lt;/a&gt; conference in 2000. He criticised the &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Lawrence"&gt;Stephen Lawrence&lt;/a&gt; enquiry and the &lt;a href="w%3AMacpherson%20report"&gt;Macpherson report&lt;/a&gt; which followed it.

On March 9, 2006, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George Bush&lt;/a&gt; signed the reauthorization of the &lt;a href="w%3APatriot%20Act"&gt;Patriot Act&lt;/a&gt;, which contained requirements for Congressional oversight of Executive use of the Act's powers. In a statement immediately following the signing ceremony, however, it was revealed that Bush "did not feel obliged to obey requirements that he inform Congress about how the FBI was using the act's expanded police powers."

Such &lt;a href="w%3Asigning%20statement"&gt;signing statements&lt;/a&gt; typically allow the President to inform Congress about how he interprets the bill he has just signed into law. However, Bush's declaration that he would not follow the oversight rules if doing so would "impair foreign relations, national security, the deliberative process of the executive, or the performance of the executive's constitutional duties" is seen as extraordinary by legal scholars, who feel it contradicts language in the bill directly, and may violate the system of &lt;a href="w%3Achecks%20and%20balances"&gt;check-and-balance&lt;/a&gt; on which the U.S. government is founded.

The controversy surrounding the statement follows several other high-profile cases where Bush has claimed constitutional authority to bypass a law, including a claim that wartime powers permitted wiretaps of international phone calls without warrants, and a signing statement bypassing the &lt;a href="w%3AMcCain%20Detainee%20Amendment"&gt;McCain Detainee Amendment&lt;/a&gt;.

After four days of protesting the disputed election victory of &lt;a href="Alexander%20Lukashenko"&gt;Alexander Lukashenko&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMinsk"&gt;Minsk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Belarus"&gt;Belarus&lt;/a&gt;, protesters have been dispersed by riot police using clubs. Police arrested some 300 protesters in the process of ending the demonstration. 

The &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; released a statement condemning the arrest of these protestors, and "decided to take restrictive measures against those responsible for the violations of international electoral standards, including president Lukashenko." The twenty-five member states have called for the immediate release of all protesters, including an estimated 400 arrested during the five-day protest against the election.

Spokeswoman Janelle Hironimus of the &lt;a href="US"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; Department of State also responded to this morning's raid, stating: "As we have said before, we condemn all acts by the government of Belarus to deprive the citizens of that country of their right to peacefully express their views."

Canadian official Pamela Greenwell, a spokeswoman for the Foreign Affairs Department, confirmed that a freelance Canadian journalist was also arrested during the raid.

&lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Martin%20%28FCC%29"&gt;Kevin Martin&lt;/a&gt;, current head of the &lt;a href="w%3AFCC"&gt;FCC&lt;/a&gt;, voiced his support on Wednesday for a tiered Internet. This plan would open the door for AT&amp;T, BellSouth, Verizon, and other telcos to limit bandwidth to popular web sites such as Google unless those sites paid significantly higher rates.

Network neutrality is usually taken to mean that telcos and ISPs may not limit services or bandwidth, charge extra fees, or otherwise discriminate based upon a site's identity or content type.

However, Mr. Martin said he viewed &lt;a href="w%3Anetwork%20neutrality"&gt;network neutrality&lt;/a&gt; as applying only to outright blocks, and that other forms of content- or identity-based pricing were acceptable and did not violate network neutrality.

When the telcos began their recent lobbying campaign, &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Geist"&gt;Professor Michael Geist&lt;/a&gt; (University of Ottawa, Faculty of Law) said that "While prioritising websites or applications may hold some economic promise, the lack of broadband competition and insufficient transparency surrounding these actions will rightly lead to growing calls for regulatory reform that grants legal protection for the principle of network neutrality."

According to ♡❤The Nation♡❤, the multi-tiered approach being considered by the telcos could eventually expand to set limits on the number of downloads, media streams, or even email messages.

&lt;a href="w%3ARon%20Wyden"&gt;Senator Ron Wyden&lt;/a&gt; (D-Oregon) has proposed legislation to prevent a two-tiered Internet.

Peter Hammond, a pastor &amp; director at Cape Town Frontline Fellowship, has been charged with assault, after leading his four children on a paintball shooting spree, targeting trick-or-treaters last Halloween.

His 11 year old son had originally been a codefendant, but the charges were recently dropped. As a result, the charges against Hammond have been transferred out of juvenile court. Mr. Hammond will file a plea next month.

Cape Town Frontline Fellowship is an evangelical missionary organization. Peter Hammond is also known for his work as a pro-gun activist, and a number of Chrisitian missionary &amp; anti-islamic books. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.intouchmission.org/reports/main.htm%3Fhttp%3A//www.intouchmission.org/reports/archives/000323.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The &lt;a href="US%20Supreme%20Court"&gt;Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; recently ruled that police cannot search a home when one resident invites them in but another tells them to go away.

The 5&amp;ndash;3 decision puts new limits on officers who want to search for evidence of a crime without obtaining a warrant first. If one occupant tells them no, the search is unconstitutional, justices said.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChief%20Justice"&gt;Chief Justice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Roberts"&gt;John Roberts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wrote his first dissent, predicting severe consequences for women who want police to come in but are overruled by abusive husbands.

The decision ended a trend of rulings by the court. About two-thirds of the 30 rulings under the leadership of Roberts have been unanimous, a high number on a court that has in the past been polarized along ideological lines.

The court's liberal members, joined by centrist &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAnthony%20M.%20Kennedy"&gt;Anthony M. Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , said that an officer responding to a domestic dispute call did not have the authority to enter and search the home of a small-town &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeorgia%20%28US%20state%29"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; lawyer in 2001 even though the man's wife invited him in.

The &lt;a href="w%3A%20Falcon%201"&gt;Falcon 1&lt;/a&gt; rocket, launched by &lt;a href="w%3ASpaceX"&gt;SpaceX&lt;/a&gt;, was destroyed shortly after its maiden launch today. Despite an earlier highly successful static test firing off the main engines, this fourth attempt at launch failed during the first stage burn. After clearing the tower, an onboard webcam revealed a swirl of flame around the base of the rocket before contact was lost.
Both the Falcon 1 launcher and its &lt;a href="w%3AFalconsat"&gt;Falconsat&lt;/a&gt; payload were lost.

It was later revealed that a fire had cut a helium pneumatic line causing the safety valves in the fuel system to automatically close, shutting down the main engine. The cause of the fire and the fuel leak that fed it has yet to be determined.

A cloth Easter Bunny holding a sign that said "Happy Easter" was removed from the lobby of City Hall in &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Paul%2C%20Minnesota"&gt;St. Paul, Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;.

The city's human rights director, Tyrone Terrill, requested that the display be removed because it could offend non-Christians, but also said that no one had complained to him about the display.

"This has just gone too far. We can't celebrate Spring with bunnies and fake grass?", said Council member Dave Thune.

"As government, we have a different responsibility about advancing the cause of religion, which we are not going to do," said council president, Kathy Lantry.

The display was put up by a city council secretary and no city funds were used to buy the display. For nearly ten years, the same secretary put up decorations in the same lobby to celebrate St. Patrick's Day, Christmas, Valentine's Day and Fall.

<h1>Police arrest roof-climbing graduate of high school in Hopkinton, Massachusetts</h1>

&lt;a href="w%3AHopkinton%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Hopkinton, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; police yesterday arrested a former student of the Hopkinton High School who had entered the school and climbed the roof.

Christopher Stevens, 19, a graduate of Hopkinton High School, entered the school around dismissal time, carrying a &lt;a href="w%3Abaseball%20bat"&gt;baseball bat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Achain"&gt;chain&lt;/a&gt;, smoking a &lt;a href="w%3Acigarette"&gt;cigarette&lt;/a&gt;. Stevens headed towards the library and was trailed by school administrators. Although the buliding was mostly clear, those still left in the buliding were told to leave immediately. Stevens then broke some windows and climbed onto the school's roof. Stevens told officials he took some medicine and was suicidal.

Stevens suffered cuts on his hands; when a police officer tended to his cuts on his hands, the officer grabbed him and pulled him down to a lower section of the roof. He was then lowered down from the roof in a rescue basket where he was placed in a ambulance to be taken to at Leonard Morse Hospital in &lt;a href="w%3ANatick%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Natick, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; to be treated for the cuts on his hands and the medicine overdose.

Stevens has yet to be charged. However, he will most likely face charges. The incident is under investigation and police are not sure what made Stevens come back to the &lt;a href="w%3Ahigh%20school"&gt;high school&lt;/a&gt;. No other students were injured.

On the day before a large rally planned in downtown Los Angeles, hundreds of Latino Los Angeles high school students staged a walkout this Friday to protest proposed federal legislation that calls for building a 700-mile-long fence along the Mexican-American border and cracking down on illegal immigrants. 

Students carried red, green, and white ballons, and shouted cheers of "Viva Mexico!". Protestors claimed that the new laws were unfair to immigrants, both legal and illegal. They stated that "...this country was built by the blood, sweat and tears of immigrants..." Students were urged by activists and community groups to stage a walk out during classes.

The protest was relatively peaceful, resulting in a few traffic jams, and one arrest. One man was arrested for throwing bottles at police officers, although it is unknown whether or not the man was a student. 

This walkout is one among similar other protests as the Senate Judiciary Committee is set to begin debate next week on motions to toughen immigration laws in the United States. It is estimated that 11 million illegal immigrants reside within U.S. borders.

A supersonic jet engine known as a "&lt;a href="w%3Ascramjet"&gt;scramjet&lt;/a&gt;," which could substantially reduce air travel time has been tested at &lt;a href="w%3AWoomera%2C%20South%20Australia"&gt;Woomera&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Australia"&gt;South Australia&lt;/a&gt;'s far north. An international team launched the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.astronautix.com/lvs/terorion.htm"&gt;Terrier-Orion&lt;/a&gt; rocket carrying the &lt;a href="w%3AHypersonic"&gt;hypersonic&lt;/a&gt; scramjet&amp;mdash;an oxygen-sucking &lt;a href="w%3Asupersonic"&gt;supersonic&lt;/a&gt; combustion ramjet engine. The rocket took the prototype aircraft to an altitude of 314km (195 mi) before crashing ten minutes later, a spokeswoman for the Hyshot program said. A supersonic boom was felt across the Woomera test range seconds after the jet took off. 

The Queensland-led &lt;a href="w%3AHyShot"&gt;HyShot&lt;/a&gt; III experiment uses a scramjet engine developed by UK company, &lt;a href="w%3AQinetiQ"&gt;QinetiQ&lt;/a&gt;. Travelling at 8,000 &lt;a href="w%3AKilometre%20per%20hour"&gt;km/h&lt;/a&gt; (~5000 mph), or ten times the speed of a conventional jet, and almost eight times the speed of sound (Mach 8), the rocket turned and powered back to Earth some 400 km (250 mi) down the range. The scientists are hoping the scramjet kicked into action during a six-second window shortly before impact.

The advantage of a scramjet is that once it is accelerated to about Mach 4 by a conventional jet engine or booster rocket, it can fly at hypersonic speeds, possibly as fast as Mach 15, without carrying heavy oxygen tanks, as conventional rockets do.

Team leader Professor Allan Paul says that the flight went well, but that it will take several months to analyse the collected data. He told the media it was too soon to tell if the $2 million experiment had been a success. 

Another HyShot team member Michael Smart said the flight followed the nominal trajectory and impacted 400 &lt;a href="w%3AKilometre"&gt;km&lt;/a&gt; (250 mi) from its launch pad. Dr Smart said that radar tracking data showed the experiment had gone to plan.

Professor Paull said scramjet-powered passenger jets were still a long way off, but it might be possible to have a scramjet-powered vehicle within the next decade. He says the team is happy with the result so far.

NASA set the speed record for a jet-powered aircraft in [November 2004] during the third and final flight of the experimental &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20X-43"&gt;X-43A scramjet project&lt;/a&gt;. 

Two HyShot scramjet flights had previously been made&amp;mdash;one on 30 October 2001 and another on 30 July 2002. Supersonic combustion was achieved on the second flight. HyShot IV launch is planned for 28 March.

The Pentagon claims that &lt;a href="w%3ASaddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt; received intelligence from a &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; ambassador about &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; plans and movements during the opening days of the 2003 &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; invasion. Russia's foreign intelligence service has denied the allegations in a statement issued Friday stating "Similar, baseless allegations concerning Russia's intelligence have been made more than once. We don't consider it necessary to comment on such fabrications." 

A report released by the Pentagon on Friday states that Russia had a source inside the US Central Command base in &lt;a href="w%3ADoha%2C%20Qatar"&gt;Doha, Qatar&lt;/a&gt;, who passed information to Russia's ambassador to Iraq. It is alleged that the ambassador provided the information to Hussein. The intelligence passed to Hussein provided information on US military plans, troop numbers, units and locations.

The report does not comment on the value or accuracy of the information which was allegedly leaked to Hussein. The Pentagon claims that the report is based on Iraqi documents and interviews with Iraqi officials. A Pentagon staffer who assisted in compiling the report, Brigadier General Anthony Cucolo, stated that there was no evidence that Russia has a spy inside Central Command. He further added that key details provided to Hussein were incorrect.

In the latest attempt to evict Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AThaksin%20Shinawatra"&gt;Thaksin Shinawatra&lt;/a&gt; ahead of next week's election, tens of thousands of protesters have rallied in &lt;a href="w%3ABangkok%2C%20Thailand"&gt;Bangkok, Thailand&lt;/a&gt;. Officials say as many as 10,000 police have been mobilised for the protest against the Thai PM. Another 10,000 officers are on standby. Police estimated the crowd at 30,000 people.

Organisers had hoped the rally would draw one million people, but officials said about the same number of monks were chanting prayers for peace and unity nearby - far fewer than the 100,000 that attended earlier demonstrations. 

Thaskin has called a snap election three years early in hopes of ending the crisis. There have been chants of "Thaksin, get out". There are reports of bands playing music near the Prime Minister's offices. A sign written in English has been posted on the fence of Government House reading "For Rent". 

A poll released this week showed Bangkok people are becoming fed up after weeks of rallying. Today's rally was a "united call" on King Bhumibol Adulyadej to replace Thaksin. The palace reports that the king is following events closely but says there are no signs he will act against Thaksin. The monarch has intervened publicly twice in his 60-year reign. The campaigners want the king to appoint a neutral government to carry out political reforms.

The three main opposition parties are boycotting the election, declaring the electoral process "unfair" as Thaksin has taken over the independent institutions. Thaksin, once the richest man in Thailand, transferred ownership of his companies to family members and employees prior to becoming Prime Minister. 

The weekly rallies in Bangkok, numbering in the hundreds of thousands, make the movement to depose the troubled Thaksin the "largest massing of public dissent since 1992," when huge demonstrations and the army's subsequent massacre of protesters culminated in the end of military rule in Thailand.

The latest rally on Saturday launched a series of protests due to continue with a march through the main shopping district. The protestors will converge on police headquarters on Monday to demand criminal charges be brought against the prime minister. 

Police would be stationed at the rally site, near his office, and at other key government offices, national police spokesman General Achirawit Suphanaphesat said. Thaksin, who has been accused of clamping down on dissent and stifling freedom of the press, vowed to call a state of emergency if protests turn violent.

Today, &lt;a href="w%3AGreece"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt; and Greeks all over the world celebrate the Greek Independence day; the 25th of March, &lt;a href="w%3A1821"&gt;1821&lt;/a&gt;, during which the struggle of the Greeks against the powerful &lt;a href="w%3AOttoman%20Empire"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt; started. The &lt;a href="w%3APresident"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AHellenic%20Republic"&gt;Hellenic Republic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACarolos%20Papoulias"&gt;Carolos Papoulias&lt;/a&gt;, and the Greek Prime Minister, &lt;a href="w%3ACostas%20Karamanlis"&gt;Costas Karamanlis&lt;/a&gt;, attended the great parade of the Armed Forces at the Constitution Square of &lt;a href="w%3AAthens"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt;. Earlier, in the Orthodox Cathedral of Athens, &lt;a href="w%3AArchbishop"&gt;Archbishop&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AChristodoulos"&gt;Christodoulos&lt;/a&gt; performed a &lt;a href="w%3ATe%20Deum"&gt;Te Deum&lt;/a&gt; which was attended by the &lt;a href="w%3Apolitical"&gt;political&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Amilitary"&gt;military&lt;/a&gt; leadership of the country. 

The Greek Independence day was celebrated in all the large cities of Greece, including &lt;a href="w%3AThessaloniki"&gt;Thessaloniki&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APatras"&gt;Patras&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ACorinth"&gt;Corinth&lt;/a&gt; where the local authorities had the opportunity to attend parades of the armed forces and high-school students.

&lt;a href="w%3AHellenism"&gt;Hellenism&lt;/a&gt; across the world celebrates the Independence day as well. From &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, Greek communities organized events and parades in honour of March 25, 1821.

Country music singer-songwriter icon and 1996 &lt;a href="w%3ACountry%20Music%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20and%20Museum"&gt;Country Music Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; inductee &lt;a href="w%3ABuck%20Owens"&gt;Buck Owens&lt;/a&gt; has passed away at his residence. He was 76. 

Family spokesman Jim Shaw made the announcement. 

Considered by many the original &lt;a href="w%3ARhinestone%20Cowboy"&gt;rhinestone cowboy&lt;/a&gt;, Owens was responsible for over 20 number one hits including his first, "Act Naturally," in 1963, "Together Again," and "I've Got a Tiger by the Tail". Most of his biggest hits were released from the mid 1960's to mid 1970's. Among the numerous recording artists who recorded his songs were &lt;a href="w%3AEmmylou%20Harris"&gt;Emmylou Harris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Athe%20Beatles"&gt;the Beatles&lt;/a&gt;, who recorded "Act Naturally", and &lt;a href="w%3ADwight%20Yoakam"&gt;Dwight Yoakam&lt;/a&gt;, who had a 1988 duet with Owens on "Streets of Bakersfield". Many of these artists made hits for themselves as well with his songs. He was mentioned in cameo-passing during the &lt;a href="w%3ACreedence%20Clearwater%20Revival"&gt;Creedence Clearwater Revival&lt;/a&gt; song "Lookin' Out My Backdoor".

He transformed country music with his honky-tonk "Bakersfield Sound", so named for the town of his residence 100 miles north of Los Angeles where he moved in 1951. With Roy Clark, he co-hosted the long-running popular television comedy country-themed musical variety show ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AHee-Haw"&gt;Hee-Haw&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ from 1969-1986. Owens's memorable red, white and blue guitar became his visual performance trademark. 

Owens had throat cancer surgery in 1993 and was hospitalized with pneumonia in January 1997. 

Born Alvis Edgar Owens on August 12, 1929 outside &lt;a href="w%3ASherman%2C%20Texas"&gt;Sherman, Texas&lt;/a&gt;, he was the son of a sharecropper, and moved with his family to Arizona during the &lt;a href="w%3AGreat%20Depression"&gt;Great Depression&lt;/a&gt; at age 8, and by age 16 was playing music in taverns. 

His first wife Bonnie sometimes performed with him, later becoming a lead back-up singer after their 1953 divorce. One of their two sons, Alvis Alan Owens, became a singer under the stage name Buddy Alan and had a 1968 top 10 hit "Let the World Keep on a -Turnin", and sang many duets with his father. 

His two other sons, Michael and John, survive him.

Student protests against the French Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ADominique%20de%20Villepin"&gt;Dominique de Villepin&lt;/a&gt; job reform plan to give employers the right to dismiss young employees within the initial two years of their employment turned increasingly violent over the last two weeks.

The controversial program called the CPE, "First Job Contract", is to encourage employers to hire people under the age of 26. The French government claims that this process is necessary to reduce the unemployment rates of young people, which is pegged as high as 23% (this rate is the quotient of the number of people under 26 deemed to seek employment over the total of those employed and deemed to seek employment, which excludes the large proportion of students in that population). However, student protestors and trade unions say that the legislation infringes on workers' rights, and opinion polls show that some two-thirds of the population want the CPE either modified or dropped altogether.

The CPE allows employers to hire people age 26 and younger on a contract for up to two years which may be terminated at any time without explanation. While supporters of the law say that it will make younger people more attractive for employers, opponents say it makes it harder for young people to find long-term employment as there is no incentive for employers to offer any other form of contract.

Labour unions and student organisers are calling for a national strike on Tuesday, the fifth strike in the past two weeks.

The French labor laws are claimed to be among those protecting employees the most in Europe; they prevent employers from trimming their workforces without paying substantial severance packages. Prime Minister de Villepin's claims to intend to reduce youth unemployment by focusing on attracting modern industries relying on higher employee turnover and more flexible employment arrangements.

The current program is similar to the CNE &lt;a href="w%3AGovernment_of_France%23Ordinances"&gt;ordinance&lt;/a&gt; the Prime Minister issued last summer for small businesses in France. 

CPE was adopted under an exceptional "fast-track" procedure allowing the executive to pass legislation through Parliament without Parliament having to approve it, known as "49-3" following from the number of the relevant article in the &lt;a href="w%3AConstitution%20of%20France"&gt;French Constitution&lt;/a&gt;. This procedure is normally reserved for important but controversial texts considered a crucial and urgent element of the policies of the Prime Minister. Once 49-3 is declared, the law is considered adopted by Parliament unless the National Assembly votes a motion of censure, which terminates the Prime Minister and his cabinet's term. Following standard practice when 49-3 is used, a motion of censure was proposed by the opposition, then voted down by the Assembly (in which the ruling UMP party has a majority).

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
For the second weekend in a row, demonstrators protested the Elmwood Village Hotel proposal on the proposed site.

The Elmwood Village Hotel is a proposed hotel by Savarino Construction Services Corporation and is designed by architect Karl Frizlen of the Frizlen Group. It is to be placed on the corner of Elmwood and Forest Avenues in Buffalo and will require the demolition of at least five properties (1109-1121 Elmwood).

The proposal also required that all five properties, including 605 Forest, be rezoned to a "C-2" zone, or a "special development plan." The rezoning was passed by Buffalo's Common Council on March 21, 2006.

Russell Smith, owner of the Six Nation's Gift Shop at 1121 Elmwood, also participated in the protest.

"I am a Native American and we opened a Native American gift shop and we are just brand new [and just] opened. Having started out a business for the first time, and it the only Native American shop in the city, and I do not see the use of any hotel, especially at this district. The Elmwood Strip is pretty well established. Some of these people have been here a long while you know and they're [Savarino Construction] disrupting their livelihood," said Smith to ♡❤Wikinews♡❤.

When Smith was asked if he was going to be in any of the shops in the new hotel he replied, "we don't have the option of getting into the hotel or any of the shops that are going to be there. We haven't [had] any idea that they [Savarino] were even planning to tear these buildings down to put a hotel here until we had moved in. I think thats a little unfair."

Former City of Buffalo Mayor Anthony Masiello was asked to sign the petition to stop the hotel when he walked by, but he declined saying, "I respect what you are doing, but I am for the hotel."

Despite the cold weather, at least 45 people showed up to walk the picket line.

For the moment, no further protests have been scheduled, pending the final decision on the hotel proposal by the city's Planning Board which meets Tuesday, March 28, 2006. The meeting begins at 8:00am and will be held in room 902 on the 9th floor of City Hall in downtown Buffalo.

<h3>Area residents and business owners receive legal advice</h3>
On Saturday morning several individuals attended a meeting with a lawyer to see what could be done, if anything, about the proposal and about Hans Mobius, former Buffalo mayoral candidate and owner of the properties to be demolished at 1109-1121 Elmwood.

One of the attendees, Nancy Pollina, co-owner of Don Apparel with Patty Morris, stated that "there is a case" but that she is likely unable to afford the large attorney's fees. Pollina reports that she is looking into a "legal fund."

Some of the affected are considering going to the New York State Supreme Court &lt;a href="w%3Apro%20se"&gt;pro se&lt;/a&gt; to seek an injunction. 

Some tenants of Mobius's buildings have accused him of being a "slumlord" and claim that he "intentionally neglected" his properties with the intention of selling. Mobius, who has owned the properties for about 20 years, tried in 1995 to sell them to a developer who wanted to build a Walgreens Drugstore on the same site as the proposed hotel.

Mobius is expected to appear in housing Court on April 11, 2006. He has not returned any phone calls from ♡❤Wikinews♡❤.

Seven young people are dead with two more hospitalized in &lt;a href="w%3ASeattle%252C_Washington"&gt;Seattle, Washington&lt;/a&gt;, after a murder-suicide shooting Saturday morning in the Capitol Hill neighborhood. The gunman, identified by police and witnesses as Kyle Huff, 28, left a party briefly to retrieve a pistol-grip shotgun and a handgun from his nearby truck. When he returned, he started firing. He turned his shotgun on himself when apprehended by a police officer on the porch of the house where the shootings took place. The King County Medical Examiner's Office identified the dead as Jeremy Martin, 26, Christopher Williamson, 21, Jason Travers, 32, Justin Schwartz, 22, Suzanne Thorne, 15, and Melissa Moore, 14.

No altercation was reported at the party, and no motive has been identified for the killings. Before returning to the party, Huff spray-painted the word, "now," on the sidewalk, and on the steps approaching the house. Seattle police officer Steve Leonard heard the shots, and arrived on the scene to find Huff emerging from the house. Huff was warned to drop his weapon, at which point he aimed his shotgun at his own head and fired.

Three of the victims were killed in the living room, and another two were found dead on the porch and steps of the house. Another died at the hospital. One of the hospitalized victims was initially reported in critical condition, but was upgraded Monday morning to satisfactory condition.

Huff, originally from Whitefish, Montana, had been charged in 2000 with felony criminal mischief for firing on a sculpture with a shotgun, according to Flathead County, Montana Sherriff Jim Dupont. Police found an assault rifle, a machete and ammunition in Huff's truck, and a search of his North Seattle apartment turned up three more rifles.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Council%20of%20Trade%20Unions%20%28ACTU%29"&gt;Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU)&lt;/a&gt; has urged the federal opposition &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Labor Party&lt;/a&gt; to focus on &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian_industrial_relations_legislation%252C_2005"&gt;industrial relations (IR)&lt;/a&gt; as significant changes come into force from Monday 27th March. The legislation was passed in a row of controversy by parliament in December last year.

The contentious &lt;a href="w%3AWorkChoices"&gt;WorkChoices&lt;/a&gt; measures aim to move workers onto a federal industrial relations system and increase to the use of individual workplace contracts - under which conditions such as overtime and penalty rates can be set. The new WorkChoices arrangements include scrapping of &lt;a href="w%3AUnfair_dismissal"&gt;unfair dismissal rights&lt;/a&gt;; the control by Federal government over state-based IR systems; more encouragement of individual contracts; award-cutting of award rates; secret ballots for industrial action and removal of the no-disadvantage test in new contracts.

The union movement has launched a fresh campaign to protest this week's changes. ACTU secretary Greg Combet warns that some employees will feel the effects as soon as they come into force, because they will no longer be protected by the previous unfair dismissal laws. He says with the changes becoming enforced this week, the Federal opposition party must now concentrate on industrial relations and not on "political infighting". 

Australia's Prime Minister, &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt;, says he's prepared for a union scare-mongering over the IR laws, but assumes the campaign will fail. "I predict the scare campaign will go on," he said. "I also predict that the scare campaign will fail." Mr Howard says workers should wait and experience the new system for themselves and that the changes will give workers greater flexibility. "Over time it will be beneficial," he said.

Combet feels different about the effects. "It's likely, somewhere around Australia tomorrow, someone is going to be sacked unfairly and they'll be the first victim of the new laws," he told the ABC. "The really significant thing is that the balance of power in the workplace is shifting sharply to the business community, to the employer."

Federal Workplace Relations Minister Kevin Andrews told reporters last week that "the sky would not fall, because people would go to work next Monday and not detect any difference." He described union protests as "hysterical outbursts". "There is nothing in this legislation that people need to worry about in the ordinary course," he said.

Despite the Howard government's increased majority in the Senate, the passing of bill has not been smooth. In November last year, &lt;a href="Hundreds_of_thousands_rally_in_Australia_against_IR_legislation"&gt;hundreds of thousands of demonstrators rallied across the nation&lt;/a&gt; to express dissent of the IR legislation. Ex-Finance Minister, Senator Nick Minchin, said most Australians "violently disagree" with the recent IR changes and there was a real prospect that the High Court could overturn the Work Choices laws.

The HR Nicholls Society, described as one of Australia's most politically conservative organisations, has likened the new federal laws to the former Soviet system of "command and control." Society president Ray Evans says he does not like the centralised power being handed to the government under the changes, nor its encroachment on states' rights. 

Evans says the myriad of complex new laws would create a system where "so-called IR professionals would stand to make a lot of money sorting through it... every economic decision has to go back to some central authority and get ticked off," he said . "There is a lot of that sort of attitude in this legislation and I think it is very unfortunate."
Kemalex Plastics owner Richard Colebatch of the HR Nicholls Society said the changes are "very complicated for anybody to decipher... The professionals will spend a lot of money, the employers' money, working their way through the mire trying to create the new rules people are going to work towards."
But the Prime Minister says "more jobs will be generated in the small business sector as a result of the removal of the absurd job-destroying unfair dismissal laws, and the greater flexibility for people to make workplace agreements at the enterprise level will lift productivity," he told reporters in Melbourne. "Sure some people will complain, but a lot of people will benefit through getting job opportunities. Young people, who will get an opportunity to put their step on the bottom rung of the ladder for the first time, will benefit enormously."

The Australian Medical Association (AMA) said WorkChoices regulations do not go far enough in clarifying who can legally issue medical certificates for sick leave. AMA vice-president Dr Choong-Siew Yong said WorkChoices regulations meant employers and employees faced uncertainty and confusion over sick leave. 

"The regulations fail to acknowledge two very serious failings," Dr Yong said in a statement. "One, if people are seriously ill, they should be seeing their medical doctor. Two, opening up medical certification to a whole range of non-medical practitioners will make it difficult for employers to take sick leave seriously."

<h1>European Union demands release of Belarusian opposition leader</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=European%20Union%20demands%20release%20of%20Belarusian%20opposition%20leader&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; (EU) has demanded the release of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAlexandr%20Kozulin"&gt;Alexandr Kozulin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a &lt;a href="Belarus"&gt;Belarus&lt;/a&gt;ian opposition leader arrested during a protest rally in &lt;a href="Minsk"&gt;Minsk&lt;/a&gt;. Kozulin was one of the leaders in a series of rolling protests against the recent election victory of President &lt;a href="Alexander%20Lukashenko"&gt;Alexander Lukashenko&lt;/a&gt;.

The EU president is "appalled by the violence used against demonstrators by the Belarusian authorities," it said in a statement. "It expresses serious concern about the arrest of demonstrators and members of the democratic opposition, including presidential candidate Alexander Kozulin, and demands their immediate release," the statement said.

Reports indicate that the streets of Minsk have settled to a "peaceful standstill" on Sunday, after riot police moved in to break up a protest rally - a day after reports that police brutally dispersed large crowds in the capital. Police in riot gear stormed a rally on Friday, removing hundreds of protesters by truck. During a rally on Saturday, Alexander Kozulin was "pulled out of a car by police and taken away." 

Kozulin's spokeswoman Nina Shedlovskaya said he had been beaten by police. On Sunday, Kozulin's wife, Irina, described his condition was "OK." "The rescue squad wasn't called for him," she told the Associated Press. Also Sunday, about 80 pro-Lukashenko youth activists picketed the U.S. Embassy in Minsk, shouting "Hands off Belarus." Russian news agencies report that the Polish Embassy was also picketed.

Kozulin was detained as protesters marched on a jail holding others detained during what is being called "the biggest protests in Belarus for ten years." Belarus Independent Media Centre reports that the "arrest of 460 people in the protest tent camp on Friday morning had provoked the population and strengthened the general protest mood in Belarus." 

The Belarus IMC report says: "More than 5000 people gathered on Saturday in the centre of Minsk for the demonstration which had been announced. Authorities opposed the protest with all available police forces, special services and the army."

Demonstrators demand a repeat of last week's election poll. Mr Lukashenko, President of Belarus since 1994, has been widely accused of pursuing "Soviet-style policies, closing down the media and cracking down on rivals." President Lukashenko contends the United States and Western European countries are giving financial and moral support to the opposition group. 

EU Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner also demanded that Belarus release members of the opposition.
"I urge the Belarussian government to adhere to the rules of democracy," Ferrero-Waldner was quoted as saying. "If the Belarussian government does not show remorse, visa bans will probably be sharpened. In concrete terms, that means that those responsible will not be able to travel to EU member states. Foreign assets of Belarussian lawmakers could also be frozen. It's important that sanctions do not hurt the people." 

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Milinkevich"&gt;Alexander Milinkevich&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Belarus's main opposition leader, praised Belarussians who have been protesting since the election. However he acknowledged that their numbers were not enough to defeat Lukashenko's government.

The &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Mason%20University"&gt;George Mason University&lt;/a&gt; Patriots of the Colonial Athletic Association (CAA) defeated the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Connecticut"&gt;University of Connecticut&lt;/a&gt; Huskies today in overtime, 86-84. 

GMU becomes the first team from the CAA to reach the Final Four in a &lt;a href="w%3ANCAA"&gt;NCAA&lt;/a&gt; Division I &lt;a href="w%3Abasketball"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt; championship, and only the second 11th seed (LSU was the other in 1986). The Huskies were the number one seed in the Washington Region. GMU is also the first true mid-major to reach the &lt;a href="w%3AFinal%20Four"&gt;Final Four&lt;/a&gt; since 1979 with &lt;a href="w%3APenn%20State"&gt;Penn State&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AIndiana%20State"&gt;Indiana State&lt;/a&gt;. 

This year held the Patriots' first NCAA Tournament game victory, where they beat Michigan State (No. 6 seed) and the University of North Carolina (No. 3 seed) in the first two rounds. They defeated Wichita State in the third round, setting up today's match against UConn.

Although GMU lost to the University of North Carolina - Wilmington in the CAA Championship bid, the NCAA selection committee awarded the team an at-large bid. This drew criticism from sports commentators such as &lt;a href="w%3ABilly%20Packer"&gt;Billy Packer&lt;/a&gt;, who felt it was more appropriate to give at-large bids to schools from major conferences, like the &lt;a href="w%3ABig%20East"&gt;Big East&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABig%2010"&gt;Big 10&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="w%3AACC"&gt;ACC&lt;/a&gt;. Packer argued that the tougher schedules during the regular season in those conferences gave more legitimacy to teams in those leagues.

&lt;a href="w%3AIndy%20Racing%20League"&gt;Indy Racing League (IRL)&lt;/a&gt; driver &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Dana"&gt;Paul Dana&lt;/a&gt; died Sunday afternoon, following injuries sustained during a crash in the warmup session of the Toyota 300 race at &lt;a href="w%3AHomestead-Miami%20Speedway"&gt;Homestead-Miami Speedway&lt;/a&gt;.

During the warmup, &lt;a href="w%3AEd%20Carpenter"&gt;Ed Carpenter's&lt;/a&gt; car spun out of control heading into a turn due to a tire failure. Carpenter's car hit the raceway wall and went into a spin down the race track when Dana hit his car on the side while travelling at over 200 mph (321 km/h). The team reported that Paul was warned of the danger by his &lt;a href="w%3Aspotter"&gt;spotter&lt;/a&gt;, but did not ease off as much as other drivers in the section of the track. The slow-motion footage appeared to show Paul hitting debris from Ed's car a few seconds before the main impact.

Both were taken to a nearby hospital, where Dana died nearly two hours later, shortly after noon &lt;a href="w%3AEST"&gt;local time&lt;/a&gt; (1700 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;). According to Henry Block, senior director of medical services for the IRL, Carpenter was listed in stable condition at the hospital.

Dana's wife, who was attending a church service in &lt;a href="w%3AIndianapolis"&gt;Indianapolis&lt;/a&gt; at the time, was informed of his death shortly afterwards.

Despite Dana's death, the Toyota 300 continued as scheduled. However, teammates &lt;a href="w%3ADanica%20Patrick"&gt;Danica Patrick&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABuddy%20Rice"&gt;Buddy Rice&lt;/a&gt; did not compete. &lt;a href="w%3ADan%20Wheldon"&gt;Dan Wheldon&lt;/a&gt; beat &lt;a href="w%3AHelio%20Castroneves"&gt;Helio Castroneves&lt;/a&gt; by the car's cone nose to win the race. Wheldon had placed Dana's number, #17, onto his car before the race.

Dana's death is the first in the league for nearly three years. &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Renna"&gt;Tony Renna&lt;/a&gt;, the last driver in the league to die in a fatal accident, was killed during a test at the &lt;a href="w%3AIndianapolis%20Motor%20Speedway"&gt;Indianapolis Motor Speedway&lt;/a&gt;. Dana was also the first death at Homestead since 1997, when &lt;a href="w%3ANASCAR"&gt;NASCAR&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACraftsman%20Truck%20Series"&gt;Craftsman Truck Series&lt;/a&gt; racer &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Nemechek"&gt;John Nemechek&lt;/a&gt; was killed in an accident.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Airbus%20A380%20safety%20test%20injures%2033&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Thirty-three people were injured during a test of the &lt;a href="w%3AAirbus"&gt;Airbus&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAirbus_A380"&gt;A380&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3Adouble%20decker"&gt;double decker&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASuperjumbo"&gt;superjumbo&lt;/a&gt; jet, in &lt;a href="w%3AHamburg"&gt;Hamburg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;. Injuries include friction burns from sliding down the escape ramps and one broken leg. 853 volunteer "passengers" and 20 crew members took about 80 seconds to evacuate the aircraft, beating the test's requirements by 10 seconds and over 200 people "rescued". Only eight of the plane's sixteen exits were used, as required by the test; the crew members were not told in advance which doors would open. The test was carried out in a dark hangar and the plane's aisles were littered with debris to simulate actual emergency conditions.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAirbus%20A380"&gt;A380&lt;/a&gt; will be the world's largest passenger airliner, almost twice as large as the current largest airliner, the &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20747"&gt;Boeing 747&lt;/a&gt;. Airbus has had 159 planes on order by 16 customers, and the first A380s will go to &lt;a href="w%3ASingapore%20Airlines"&gt;Singapore Airlines&lt;/a&gt; towards the end of the year.

This test was important to Airbus, as in &lt;a href="w%3AAugust%202005"&gt;August 2005&lt;/a&gt; an &lt;a href="w%3AAirbus%20A340"&gt;Airbus A340&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAir%20France%20Flight%20358"&gt;overshot the runway&lt;/a&gt; and 300 people escaped before the plane burst into flames. &lt;a href="w%3AInfrared%20camera"&gt;Infrared camera&lt;/a&gt; recordings of the test will be analyzed by authorities such as the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Aviation%20Safety%20Agency"&gt;European Aviation Safety Agency&lt;/a&gt;, while the &lt;a href="w%3AFAA"&gt;US Federal Aviation Administration&lt;/a&gt; was present during the test. The European Aviation Safety Agency will confirm the test results this week; Airbus intends to repeat the test on Saturday if the aviation agency fails this attempt. 

The volunteers, who were paid 60 &lt;a href="w%3Aeuro"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt;s (about &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;72) and a meal, were from Airbus staff, sports clubs, and dancing clubs in the Hamburg area where the test took place. Airbus recruited people from clubs in order to get volunteers in good physical shape.

Two days later, the American and European aviation authorities (the &lt;a href="w%3AFAA"&gt;FAA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AEASA"&gt;EASA&lt;/a&gt;, respectively) officially certified the A380 to carry 853 passengers. This certification demonstrated that the test procedures use by Airbus met their respective standards.

&lt;a href="w%3APrince%20Edward"&gt;Prince Edward&lt;/a&gt; formally closed the XVIII Commonwealth Games last night in a spectacular 4 hour ceremony at the &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne%20Cricket%20Ground"&gt;Melbourne Cricket Ground&lt;/a&gt;.

About 85,000 spectators were in attendance; &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Prime%20Minister"&gt;British Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Prime%20Minister"&gt;Australian Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; were also there.

Melbourne 2006 Chairman &lt;a href="w%3ARon%20Walker"&gt;Ron Walker&lt;/a&gt; said that the games were “the greatest coalition of Commonwealth nations ever seen….We have all been united by the moment… …&lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, we did it!”

&lt;a href="w%3ACommonwealth%20Games%20Federation"&gt;Commonwealth Games Federation&lt;/a&gt; chairmen &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Fennell"&gt;Mike Fennell&lt;/a&gt;; named Indian Shooting competitor &lt;a href="w%3ASamaresh%20Jung"&gt;Samaresh Jung&lt;/a&gt; as the winner of the &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Dixon%20Award"&gt;David Dixon Award&lt;/a&gt;, for being the Best Athlete of the 18th Commonwealth Games. Jung won five Gold; one silver and one bronze medal in the Games.

Fennell also praised the organisation, crowds, volunteers, transport, and support services as well as the athletic performances and he said that the games had been an “incredible success”.

During a press conference at 10:15 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3ACEST"&gt;CEST&lt;/a&gt; (0815 &lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated_Universal_Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;), Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AG%C3%B6ran%20Persson"&gt;Göran Persson&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ASweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; appointed &lt;a href="w%3AJan%20Eliasson"&gt;Jan Eliasson&lt;/a&gt; as the new Foreign Minister. 

Eliasson will be taking over the ministry post from &lt;a href="w%3ALaila%20Freivalds"&gt;Laila Freivalds&lt;/a&gt;, and will have Carin Jämtin, the current Minister for Development Aid, as his Deputy Foreign Minister. Until the transfer on April 24, 2006, Jämtin will be acting Minister of Foreign Affairs.

Eliasson is currently chairing the &lt;a href="w%3AUN%20General%20Assembly"&gt;UN General Assembly&lt;/a&gt;. He has also held positions as the Swedish &lt;a href="w%3AAmbassador"&gt;Ambassador&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, and as Secretary for Foreign Affairs within the Swedish government. Eliasson will fulfill his role of chair of the General Assembly, ending his term on September 11, 2006.

Freivalds was forced to resign last week when her involvement in talks between a Swedish internet hosting site associated with the controversy over the &lt;a href="w%3AJyllands-Posten%20Muhammad%20cartoons%20controversy"&gt;cartoon of Mohammed&lt;/a&gt; was questioned.

&lt;a href="w%3ACreekstone%20Farms%20Premium%20Beef"&gt;Creekstone Farms Premium Beef&lt;/a&gt;, an organic meatpacking company based in &lt;a href="w%3AArkansas%20City%2C%20Kansas"&gt;Arkansas City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Kansas"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt;, filed a lawsuit against the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Department%20of%20Agriculture"&gt;U.S. Department of Agriculture&lt;/a&gt; (USDA) for what the company claims is threats by the USDA that it would face prosecution if it proceeds with plans to test nearly 100% of its beef for &lt;a href="w%3ABovine%20spongiform%20encephalopathy"&gt;Bovine spongiform encephalopathy&lt;/a&gt;, also known as mad cow disease or BSE.

The USDA position is that allowing any meatpacking company to test every cow would undermine the agency's official position, a position that holds to random testing as a scientifically adequate measure to assure safety. It also claims that 100% testing does not ensure food safety because the disease is difficult to detect in younger animals.

The USDA currently tests about 1% of cattle slaughtered in the U.S. The USDA's objection is believed to be the result of pressure from larger meatpacking operations. In 2004, the president of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association told the Washington Post that "If testing is allowed at Creekstone, we think it would become the international standard and the domestic standard, too." Creekstone Farms says tests cost about $20 per animal, increasing the cost of beef by about 10 cents per pound.

A bomb blast near the northern city of &lt;a href="w%3AMosul"&gt;Mosul&lt;/a&gt; has killed at least 40 &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;i people. The bomber struck shortly after noon in front of a &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; military base. The Defence Ministry said 30 people were injured in the blast which they said was carried out by a suicide bomber. The U.S. military says a car bomb had exploded at an Iraqi police recruiting centre at Kisak, west of Mosul. 

The blast follows the killing of 20 Shiites at a mosque compound in &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;. Shiites have blamed U.S. forces for killing 22 people Sunday and cut off political talks in protest. The United States has said no mosque was attacked.

<h1>Greek court rules worship of ancient Greek deities is legal</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Greek%20court%20rules%20worship%20of%20ancient%20Greek%20deities%20is%20legal&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Greek court has ruled that worshippers of the &lt;a href="w%3AAncient%20Greek%20religion"&gt;ancient Greek religion&lt;/a&gt; may now formally associate and worship at archeological sites.

Prior to the ruling, the religion was banned from conducting public worship at archeological sites by the Greek Ministry of Culture. Due to that, the religion was relatively secretive.

The &lt;a href="w%3AGreek%20Orthodox%20Church"&gt;Greek Orthodox Church&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3AChristianity"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt; denomination, is extremely critical of worshippers of the ancient deities. 

Today, about 100,000 Greeks worship the ancient gods, such as &lt;a href="w%3AZeus"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHera"&gt;Hera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APoseidon"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAphrodite"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AAthena"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt;. The Greek Orthodox Church estimates that number is closer to 40,000.

Many &lt;a href="w%3Aneo-pagan"&gt;neo-pagan&lt;/a&gt; religions, such as &lt;a href="w%3AWicca"&gt;Wicca&lt;/a&gt;, use aspects of ancient Greek religions in their practice; &lt;a href="w%3A%20Hellenic%20polytheism"&gt;Hellenic polytheism&lt;/a&gt; instead focuses exclusively on the ancient religions, as far as the fragmentary nature of the surviving source material allows.

Towns and communities in north Western Australia are preparing for the sixth cyclone of the season. 
The &lt;a href="w%3ABureau%20of%20Meteorology"&gt;Bureau of Meteorology&lt;/a&gt; says a cyclone warning is current for a category 3 cyclone for coastal and island areas between Cape Leveque and Bidyadanga. A cyclone watch extends south to Dampier. The cyclone is expected to move roughly parallel to the coast in the next few days and intensify further. 

In ♡❤♡Port Hedland♡❤♡, residents were urged to prepare for Glenda, which today was a category 1 storm off the Kimberley coastline, to the north. Dampier Port supports the offshore oil and gas industry from North West Cape to Broome and offshore, the largest oil and gas export area in Australia.

&lt;a href="w%3AFire_and_Emergency_Services_Authority_of_Western_Australia"&gt;Fire and Emergency Services Authority of Western Australia (FESA)&lt;/a&gt; district manager Gordon Tiddums advises residents to closely monitor the cyclone's path and take to take precautions such as cleaning up loose material and rubbish and getting emergency supplies. 

Widespread heavy rain is expected to continue during the next few days in the north and east Kimberley. Recent tropical storms have dumped 560 millimetres in the Wyndham area over the past few days. Around 30 elderly people and young children have been evacuated from the Oombulgurri Aboriginal community, 80 kilometres west of Wyndham. 

The weather bureau says that Cyclone Floyd continues to weaken as it heads towards the WA coast. Cyclone Floyd has been downgraded to a category one system. The bureau says gales may develop during the day as the cyclone nears the coast and the system is still causing winds of more than 100 kilometres an hour.

Category Four Cyclone Floyd caused wind gusts of up to 280km an hour did not threaten the coast or the state's massive resources industry.

, one of the most popular modern writers who wrote in a language other than English, died March 27, aged 84. He died of heart failure while staying at a cardio-surgery clinic in Kraków, Poland.

Lem, described as “one of the deep spirits of the age,” was the author of dozens of books, which have been translated into 41 languages and sold over 27 million copies. He gained international fame for ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Cyberiad"&gt;The Cyberiad&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, a series of short stories from a mechanical world ruled by robots, first published in English in 1974. 

Despite his international popularity, Lem is not a member of the &lt;a href="w%3AScience%20Fiction%20and%20Fantasy%20Writers%20of%20America"&gt;Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America&lt;/a&gt;. He turned down an invitation to join the non-profit association after his honorary membership was taken away because of anger at his critical commentary about the quality of much of the science fiction being published in the United States. Many of his books have been filmed, most notably the book ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASolaris%20%28novel%29"&gt;Solaris&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, which has spawned &lt;a href="w%3ASolaris%20%28film%29"&gt;two films&lt;/a&gt; - one by &lt;a href="w%3AAndrei%20Tarkovsky"&gt;Andrei Tarkovsky&lt;/a&gt; in 1972 and the other by &lt;a href="w%3ASteven%20Soderbergh"&gt;Steven Soderbergh&lt;/a&gt; and starring &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Clooney"&gt;George Clooney&lt;/a&gt; in 2002.

On March 19, 2006, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACandace%20Parker"&gt;Candace Parker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the 6 foot, 4 inches (1.93 meters) tall &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATennessee%20Lady%20Volunteers"&gt;Tennessee Lady Volunteers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aforward"&gt;forward&lt;/a&gt;, made &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANCAA%20Basketball"&gt;NCAA Basketball&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; history and set a record as the first woman ever to double dunk in an &lt;a href="NCAA"&gt;NCAA&lt;/a&gt; game. The media buzz is that Parker has taken &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Awomen%27s%20basketball"&gt;women's basketball&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; up to a new level... the air.

During a &lt;a href="w%3AWomen%27s%20NCAA%20Championship"&gt;Women's NCAA Championship&lt;/a&gt; game against the &lt;a href="w%3AArmy%20Black%20Knights"&gt;Army Black Knights&lt;/a&gt;, Parker made her first dunk of the game with 13:44 left in the first half. The Lady Vols were ahead, 14-13, as &lt;a href="w%3ASidney%20Spencer"&gt;Sidney Spencer&lt;/a&gt; fed the ball to Parker, who flew over opponents to the net, becoming the first woman to &lt;a href="w%3Aslam%20dunk"&gt;slam dunk&lt;/a&gt; in an NCAA game. The crowd roared... not once, but twice. With 14:18 left in the second half, Parker took &lt;a href="w%3ANicky%20Anosike"&gt;Nicky Anosike&lt;/a&gt;'s pass and soared above Army and Lady Vol players. Parker palmed the ball and stuffed it through the rim for her second slam dunk in the game. Even the famously focused Coach &lt;a href="w%3APat%20Summit"&gt;Pat Summit&lt;/a&gt; took a moment to appreciate the feat. 

During an &lt;a href="NPR"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt; interview, sports analyst, &lt;a href="w%3ANancy%20Lieberman"&gt;Nancy Lieberman&lt;/a&gt;, spoke about what Parker's dunking foreshadows for &lt;a href="w%3Awomen%27s%20basketball"&gt;women's basketball&lt;/a&gt;. Both Lieberman and Summit noted that Parker frequently dunks the ball during practice, as other women do. Lieberman says that &lt;a href="w%3Awomen%27s%20basketball"&gt;women's basketball&lt;/a&gt; has developed immensely in recent years. And she expects audiences will see &lt;a href="w%3Awomen%27s%20ncaa%20basketball"&gt;women NCAA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aprofessional%20basketball%20players"&gt;professional basketball players&lt;/a&gt; use dunking and other spectacular skills much more in the future.

Most people are celebrating Parker's &lt;a href="w%3Adouble%20dunk"&gt;double dunk&lt;/a&gt; as a success. In both women's and men's basketball, a few have questioned whether dunking makes the game better. But, adding a dunk shot will certainly change the game, as will the continued development of &lt;a href="w%3Apoint%20guard"&gt;point guards&lt;/a&gt;. Basketball analysts usually agree that dunking is exciting and most say that using this &lt;a href="w%3Ahigh-percentage%20shot"&gt;high-percentage shot&lt;/a&gt; will draw bigger audiences to &lt;a href="w%3Awomen%27s%20hoops"&gt;women's hoops&lt;/a&gt;.

Shiite politicians raged against the USA and stopped negotiations on a new government after a U.S. military attack killed at least 16 people in what the Shiites said was a mosque. 
Iraqi police said gunmen fired on a joint U.S.-Iraqi patrol who were not far from the mosque. Police (and representatives of radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr) said everyone killed was in the complex for evening prayers and there were no gunmen.

AP video from Sunday night showed dead male bodies lying on the floor with gunshot wounds. The AP cameraman said it was filmed in the living quarters of the small mosque's Imam.

"In our observation of the place and the activities that were going on, it's difficult for us to consider this a place of prayer," said a U.S. military spokesman. "It was not identified by us as a mosque, though we certainly recognized it as a community gathering center. I think this is frankly a matter of perception."

The &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; addressed a special joint sitting of the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Parliament"&gt;Australian Parliament&lt;/a&gt; March 27, 2006. After introductory speeches by both the Prime Minister of &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; and the Leader of the Opposition &lt;a href="w%3AKim%20Beazley"&gt;Kim Beazley&lt;/a&gt;, Blair spoke on globalisation and trade, security, terrorism, and the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. He also touched on the Middle East and climate change. 

Mr Blair started by reminiscing about his childhood, when he lived from the age of two until five in Adelaide, South Australia. "I remember returning from the hospital where my sister Sarah had just been born, looking at her in the back of the old Austin that we drove; running errands for our neighbour, Mr Trederay; taking showers under the garden hose in the heat on the lawn; visiting friends up-country in the Adelaide Hills; and being chased by magpies as I ran across the open ground near our home."

<h3>Globalisation, trade, and development</h3>
He talked about the inevitability of &lt;a href="w%3AGlobalisation"&gt;Globalisation&lt;/a&gt;, but warned that it should be tempered by social justice. "Globalisation is a fact, but the values that govern it are a choice. We know the values we believe in: democracy and the rule of law, but also justice, the simple conviction that, given a fair go, human beings can better themselves and the world around them." He later linked security with justice, saying "there is no prosperity without security and no security without justice. That is the consequence of an interconnected world."

He described the two perspectives on trade as "open or closed", meaning those who support free trade and reduction of tarrifs, and those who are more protectionist. Mr Blair was firmly in the "open" camp, but he warned that poverty must also be tackled. "Everywhere you look today, the tide of protectionist sentiment is flowing. In this World Trade Round we have the opportunity to make it ebb. At stake, obviously, is our commitment on world poverty and development." According to Blair, rich western nations have a long way to go before their markets can be considered open. "Europe’s agricultural protection is a policy born of another age and it is time to end it. But change in Europe alone is not the answer. America must open up; Japan, too."

He also linked trade to development, saying that the connection was a matter "of justice, because the poorest nations need to be able to stand on their own two feet and trade in our markets."

<h3>Terrorism, Iraq, Afghanistan</h3>
He warned of the immediate threat of "Islamist extremism", but argued that terrorism did not begin with the September 11 attacks in the United States, but rather had a much longer history. "It simply came to our notice then. Its victims are to be found in the recent history of many lands, from Russia and India but also Algeria, Pakistan, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Indonesia, Kenya and countless more."

He acknowledged that the decision to invade Iraq was as divisive in Britain as in Australia, but sought to justify military action, saying "for almost three years now we have been in Iraq with full United Nations support. From the outset our forces in Afghanistan have been there with UN authority. In both cases, there is the full support of democratically elected governments." He also spoke of the gains made by both Iraq and Afghanistan. "In each case, the people have, for the first time, been offered a chance to vote. In each case, they have seized it, despite obstacles we can scarcely imagine."

He spoke in support of the US Alliance, but said that maintaining some independence was important. "I do not always agree with the United States. Sometimes they can be difficult friends to have."

<h3>Israel and Palestine</h3>
Mr Blair called on the United States to work for security in the Middle East, and especially for a two state solution. "once the Israeli election has taken place, we must redouble our efforts to find a way to the only solution that works—a secure state of Israel and a viable, independent Palestinian state."

<h3>Climate change</h3>

Mr Blair emphasised the need to focus on climate change, and said that it was even more important now with the crisis over oil prices. He noted the differences between the Australian and British approaches to climate change, and argued that co-operation was needed. "At some point we must bring it all together. There will be no agreement worth having that does not involve the United States, China and India, as well as the rest of us."

&lt;a href="w%3APro%20Hart"&gt;Pro Hart&lt;/a&gt;, the self-taught, internationally-acclaimed Australian artist, died at home in &lt;a href="w%3ABroken%20Hill%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Broken Hill&lt;/a&gt; on March 28 after family members decided to cease his medication. The 77-year-old had been ill with &lt;a href="w%3AMotor%20neurone%20disease"&gt;motor neurone disease&lt;/a&gt;. Family members described his passing as peaceful. Hart is a household name in &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;.

Hart's son, John Hart, says a State funeral is being organised for his father. He says his father lost the ability to paint about six months ago. Pro Hart's son David today said the funeral for the "brushman of the bush" will be held in the far-western &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; mining city of Broken Hill next Tuesday. "It will be held next Tuesday", he said, "probably in the town's civic centre."

Born Kevin Charles Hart in Broken Hill on May 30, 1928, his mining mates nicknamed him 'Professor' due to his passion for invention. He started painting "cheeky" pictures on the wooden beams of the mines he worked in. Hart went to few art classes and started painting full-time in 1958.

Since then, he has exhibited all over the world, including London, New York, Paris and Tokyo. He also illustrated several books. Hart's preoccupation with art began as a teenager on his family's sheep station near Menindee. 

His work hangs in collections all over the world. Agent Amanda Phillips says Hart was one of Australia's most renowned artists yet his paintings are not in the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Gallery%20of%20Australia"&gt;National Gallery of Australia&lt;/a&gt;. "He's a great Australian, I mean he's been given an &lt;a href="w%3AOrder%20of%20the%20British%20Empire"&gt;MBE&lt;/a&gt; for his services to art, he's been honoured all around the world, his work hangs in major collections around the world, why isn't he displayed here in Australia? A spokeswoman for the National Gallery confirmed they had a "very limited collection" of Pro Hart's works although no paintings.

<h2>Cannon Technique</h2>
Hart is renowned for his unique 'cannon' technique, which he developed in 1970. 'Cannon' painting works by filling balls with paint and firing them at the canvas using a hand-held cannon.

"If you don't fit in their groove, they don't want to know you," Hart once said of the Australian art community. Hart gained his widest recognition in Australia when he featured in a television carpet advertisement, painting a carpet with spaghetti, milk, wine and other foods. "Oh Mr Hart, what a mess!" was the catchcry. 

The Federal Member for &lt;a href="w%3AParkes%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Parkes&lt;/a&gt;, John Cobb, said Hart had been an inspirational figure in Broken Hill and helped to establish the town as one of the Australia's greatest artistic centres. 

Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; described Hart as a great artist whose portraits of the outback were instantly recognisable. "Not only will he be remembered as one of our finest painters but also for the mark he made in sculpture and through his book illustrations," Howard said in a statement.
"He made a wonderful contribution to art and culture in Australia, enhancing its profile on the world stage." 

He said Hart's artistic legacy was assured. "I think they'll remember the colour, they'll remember the unconventional methods and they'll remember the identification with a city which is part of the history of this country; a very special part."

Fellow artist &lt;a href="w%3A%3AKen%20Done"&gt;Ken Done&lt;/a&gt; said Hart's legacy was "in his paintings". He said the painter was best known for his portraits of the outback. "But I think his strongest pictures were the ones he did about his time underground – those tougher times, tougher men – and he brought a real sensitivity to that experience," Done said. 

Hart received the &lt;a href="w%3AOrder%20of%20the%20British%20Empire"&gt;Member of the Order of the British Empire&lt;/a&gt; award in 1976 for his services to art in Australia. He is survived by his wife Raylee, three sons and two daughters.

&lt;br style="clear:both;"&gt;

The &lt;a href="w%3ALong%20Beach%2C%20California"&gt;Long Beach&lt;/a&gt; Redevelopment Board voted last night to walk away from negotiations over the Filipino Baptist Fellowship church property. &lt;a href="w%3AEminent%20domain"&gt;Eminent domain&lt;/a&gt; action, authorized at the March 13 meeting, was not addressed.

During the opening comment period, the attorney for the church, John Eastman, noted his difficulty in speaking on the question, since the agenda did not indicate what question was before the board. The board chair, Thomas Fields, replied that it was not appropriate for the board to answer questions during the public comment period. 
After a five minute open session, the board recessed to discuss the church property in closed session. Fifteen minutes later, the board returned and announced that negotiations with the church were over.

Attorney Eastman and Rev Agustine, pastor of the church, conferred with long-time City Clerk Jan Pittman to clarify the meaning of the decision. She said that she understood the decision to mean that the board would not proceed with eminent domain. Responding to questions, she said that eminent domain proceedings are held in the city of Norton, and that no further notice would be due to the church if eminent domain proceedings were initiated.
The church property is located in Long Beach on Atlantic Avenue, a four lane road with two parking lanes. Most of the properties in the two block area have been acquired by the city and razed. The east side of the street was redeveloped five years ago with the construction of single family housing. The west side of the street is expected to be developed with higher density housing, but plans have not been announced. The city's redevelopment project was begun in 1996. The Filipino Baptist Fellowship purchased the church in 2002, in the open market.

Petrol prices across the UK rose to an average of 91.1p per litre (U.S. $6.02 per U.S. gallon) of premium unleaded on Tuesday, which is the highest they have been for five months. Prices have been rising ever since December 2005, when they reached a trough in the current cycle of 87.6p a litre ($5.79/gal.), and have gained about 1.5p a litre (2.6 cents) in the last 10 days.

Across the UK, petrol prices ranged from 86.9p to 100.9p ($5.74 to $6.67) for unleaded and 89.9p to 105.9p ($5.94 to $7.00) for diesel.

These figures coincide with the results of a motorists survey from AA Personal Loans, which showed that most drivers are ignorant of petrol prices. Just 14% of those surveyed were able to correctly give the current price of petrol. Out of 1700 people surveyed, the lowest estimate was 69p a litre ($4.56/gal.) and the highest was £3 a litre ($19.83/gal.).

Rev. Mary Magdalen (Rachel Bevilacqua) of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChurch%20of%20the%20SubGenius"&gt;Church of the SubGenius&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Apostmodernism"&gt;postmodern&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aparody%20religion"&gt;parody religion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , lost custody of her child in February of 2006, seemingly due to her involvement with the church. Church members are touting the judge's response to her involvement with the church together with his decision as religious discrimination, and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AACLU"&gt;ACLU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is examining the situation.

Judge James Punch (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOrleans%20County%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Orleans County&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) allegedly denied custody of the child her son out of anger, after seeing videos of Rev. Magdalen in a bondage "dress" and papier maché goat’s head at the church's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AX-Day%20%28Church%20of%20the%20SubGenius%29"&gt;X-Day celebration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aperformance%20art"&gt;performance art&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; piece. Judge Punch repeatedly asked, "Why a goat? What’s so significant about a goat’s head?" When Rev. Magdalen replied, "I just thought the word 'goat' was funny," the court then pressed her to explain how her actions were funny, finally concluding with the statement, "Obviously there's nothing funny in those pictures."

According to Rev. Magdalen, the judge reportedly lost his temper and shouted at her, calling her a "pervert," "mentally ill," "lying," and a participant in "sex orgies." Proponents of her case have been working to make the actual transcript of this statement available online.

Judge Punch ordered that Rev. Magdalen is to have absolutely no further contact with her son, not even in writing, after February 3, 2006. On March 9th, the judge issued a verbal order stating that Rev. Magdalen was to cease all communication on the Internet regarding her son, thereby preventing her from posting transcripts of the actual court proceedings (however, a transcript of her own testimony was made available on March 26th).

Rev. Magdalen has been a major figure in the Church of the SubGenius since 1997 when she and her son moved to Dallas, Texas to be with her fiancé Rev . Jesus (Steve Bevilacqua) and help keep the for-profit church afloat. The church members traditionally consider the for-profit arm to have "religious significance", due in part to the church's intentional parody of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AScientology"&gt;Scientology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Age"&gt;New Age religions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and the church declares itself to be "the only religion that is proud to pay its taxes." The Bevilacquas relocated to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AColumbus%2C%20Georgia"&gt;Columbus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 2004.

Religions or deities engaging in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Asatire"&gt;satire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , such as the Church of the SubGenius, &lt;a href="Discordianism"&gt;Discordianism&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInvisible%20Pink%20Unicorn"&gt;Invisible Pink Unicorn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFlying%20Spaghetti%20Monster"&gt;Flying Spaghetti Monster&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , have become significantly more widespread through the internet. However, the Church of the SubGenius is relatively old, dating to 1979, and gained much of its current popularity through its published books, including the ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABook%20of%20the%20SubGenius"&gt;Book of the SubGenius&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ,♡❤ and its &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHour%20of%20Slack"&gt;Hour of Slack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; radio program. Discordianism is even older, dating to 1958 or 1959, and has strongly influenced modern non-satirical neopagan religions. Such religions are now generally termed "postmodern" instead of "parody", as their followers frequently insist the religion is as real and valid as any other religion, but often accept the postmodernist critique of religious metanarratives.

Rev. Magdalen's case has been profiled on a number of popular blogs and Internet sites, including &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABoing%20Boing"&gt;Boing Boing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFark"&gt;Fark&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Following the word of this case being spread on the Internet, Judge Punch recused himself without comment. The case is being re-assigned to another judge, and Rev. Magdalen will return to court next month.

Bolten has had wide experience both on Wall Street and in Washington. In Washington he has been the Deputy Chief of Staff and also the director of the Office of Management and Budget. 

Card will remain as chief of staff until April 14. It is unknown at this time what he will do after leaving the post. He had previously served as State Representative in Holbrook, Mass., his hometown, so it has been speculated that he may return to Mass. to run for office.

<h1>UK public sector workers strike over pension rights</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=UK%20public%20sector%20workers%20strike%20over%20pension%20rights&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
Local Government workers in the &lt;a href="w%3AUK"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; withdrew their labour yesterday as part of a dispute over pension entitlements. The members of 11 different trades unions were involved in the 24hr strike. As the day began they declared that support for the strike was solid. Although the strikers work for local councils, their pay and conditions are agreed nationally. The &lt;a href="w%3ALocal%20Government%20Association"&gt;Local Government Association&lt;/a&gt; which represents the local councils in England and Wales declared predictions that 1.5 million people would stay away from work as "wildly optimistic".

The Unions' complaint is that local government workers are being treated unfavourably compared to other public sector employees. They say that agreements on pensions that have been reached with civil servants, teachers and health workers will allow those staff to continue to retire at 60 while local government staff will be forced to work until they are 65. Civil servants work for national government, teachers work for local councils but have their own pension arrangements and most health workers are employed by the state-controlled &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Health%20Service"&gt;National Health Service&lt;/a&gt;.

The Local Government Association claims that if council workers continue to be able to retire at 60, it will increase the levels of &lt;a href="w%3ACouncil%20Tax"&gt;Council Tax&lt;/a&gt; (a tax on people living in properties which funds a proportion of local government expenditure) by 2%.

The striking workers provide a wide range of services from assisting teachers in the class room, through inspecting kitchens for hygiene to provising care to the vulnerable in society. In some places council workers collect tolls for road tunnels or manage ferries. Mainstream media have reported on the strike all day with heavy coverage of disruption to commuters where transport has been affected. The unions have emphasised the large number of their members who are women working in low paid jobs.

The Government which regulates the scheme claimed that the early retirement provisions (called the rule of 85) were age-discriminatory and had to be removed.

The strike ended at midnight. The Unions have not declared any further strike days.

The Unions involved were &lt;a href="w%3AAEP"&gt;AEP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAMICUS"&gt;AMICUS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACYWU"&gt;CYWU&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGMB"&gt;GMB&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANAPO"&gt;NAPO&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANIPSA"&gt;NIPSA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANUJ"&gt;NUJ&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANUT"&gt;NUT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATGWU"&gt;TGWU&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUCATT"&gt;UCATT&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AUNISON"&gt;UNISON&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Buffalo%2C%20N.Y.%20hotel%20proposal%20gets%20final%20approval%20by%20city%20Planning%20Board&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
The proposed Elmwood Village Hotel got the final approval it needed from the city of Buffalo's Planning Board this morning.

In a unanimous vote, the Board approved most of the design and site plan of the hotel.

The Elmwood Village Hotel is a proposed hotel by Savarino Construction Services Corporation and is designed by architect Karl Frizlen of the Frizlen Group. It is to be placed on the corner of Elmwood and Forest Avenues in Buffalo and will require the demolition of at least five properties (1109-1121 Elmwood).

Despite the fact that today's meeting was not a "public hearing", several citizens lashed out at the Board after the approval.

"Thanks for destroying Buffalo," said one man.

"[I am] disgusted. Because they did not allow the community to speak, it is the bastardization of the concepts of justice and democracy, and that's what happened [today]," said Clarence Carnahan, a local business owner and concerned citizen, to ♡❤Wikinews♡❤. He also referred to some board members as "immoral pigs."

"[I feel] frustration because no one could speak. I was going to address the displacement of all the shops that are there and that they should be grand-fathered into the new space. We did not get to say that. [I am disappointed] that they are endorsing this enormous monstrosity." said Nancy Pollina, co-owner of Don Apparel with Patty Morris at 1119 Elmwood.

Although the Board approved the hotel proposal, Savarino Construction must still go before the board to approve things such as signage and lighting. The Planning Board meets again on April 11, 2006 at 8:00a.m., but it is unknown if the hotel proposal will be on the agenda.

<h3>Lawsuits likely to be filed</h3>
Pano Georgiadis, owner of Pano's Restaurant at 1081 Elmwood and owner of 605 Forest Avenue in Buffalo, threatened to sue Savarino Construction at a public meeting on March 15, 2006 saying, "if you try to get a variance to change the code, I will sue you. This is my home, number one. If you go against city code, and you try to do the most rooms with a minimal amount of parking, again, I will sue you."

Today, Georgiadis confirmed to ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ that he is "definitely" suing, but that his "situation is different" as compared to others looking into legal action. "This is my property. They did it [changed the code] without my approval."

Last week, the Common Council voted and approved the rezoning of all five properties including 605 Forest.

Some are also considering taking the case to the New York State Supreme Court to "seek an injunction"
and would go "&lt;a href="w%3Apro%20se"&gt;pro se&lt;/a&gt;, meaning I am going to present the case myself," said Carnahan.

<h3>Organizers schedule another protest</h3>
Despite the approvals by the Common Council and Planning Board, organizers schedulaed another protest for Saturday April 1, 2006 at 2:00p.m. on the proposed site at Forest and Elmwood.

"We are not going to go down without a fight. We are going to go kicking and screaming," said Pollina.

Weinberger was hospitalized for &lt;a href="w%3APneumonia"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt; and having a &lt;a href="w%3Afever"&gt;high fever&lt;/a&gt; shortly before his death.

Weinberger served under &lt;a href="w%3ARonald%20Reagan"&gt;Ronald Reagan&lt;/a&gt;'s administration during the 1980's, in which he pushed for more defense programs in the &lt;a href="w%3AMilitary%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;United States military&lt;/a&gt;, including the &lt;a href="w%3AStrategic%20Defense%20Initiative"&gt;Strategic Defense Initiative&lt;/a&gt; space defense program. He was also indicted on felony counts of lying to the independent counsel investigating the &lt;a href="w%3AIran-Contra%20Affair"&gt;Iran-Contra Affair&lt;/a&gt;, but was pardoned by then-President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20H.%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George H. W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; days before he was to go on trial..

Weinberger also was the publisher and chairman of &lt;a href="w%3AForbes%20Magazine"&gt;Forbes Magazine&lt;/a&gt; in the early 1990's. He authored a book, ♡❤Fighting for Peace♡❤, and co-authored another with &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Schweizer"&gt;Peter Schweizer&lt;/a&gt;, entitled ♡❤The Next War♡❤. Both books are based on the effects of the &lt;a href="w%3ACold%20War"&gt;Cold War&lt;/a&gt;.

Weinberger's funeral will be conducted at the &lt;a href="w%3AArlington%20National%20Cemetery"&gt;Arlington National Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;.

Researchers at the &lt;a href="w%3ABrookings%20Institute"&gt;Brookings Institution&lt;/a&gt;, a non-profit think tank located in Washington D.C., have recently accused Russian President &lt;a href="w%3AVladimir%20Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; of making improper use of almost 16 pages and six figures from a 1982 translation of a 1978 textbook in his economics dissertation. ♡❤Strategic Planning and Policy♡❤, written by &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Pittsburgh"&gt;University of Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt; professors William R.

Gaddy states, "I'm convinced that Putin did read that textbook. This is exactly the style of governing the country that he has used in Russia. He's actually taking their ideas and treating Russia as if it's a corporation -- 'Russia Incorporated.'" 

Many Russian government officials at the time would pay a ghostwriter for such publications, as gaining a degree could add legitimacy to one's governing policy. In that sense, it is possible Putin bought or paid for the dissertation and did not read over - in essence, passing plagiarised work off as his own, but not himself committing plagiarism. Gaddy states: "It's very clear he never wrote the thing in the first case, this is a clear diploma-mill-type operation. This is a dissertation, paid for, made-to-order."

Although Gaddy and Danchenko set out searching for Putin's views on economics and sustainable development, they noticed in reading his dissertation that certain sections seemed out of place. The only English language source in the text was King and Cleland's book. In the translation from Russia to English of the dissertation, text was discovered that came from that book without credit. 

King and Cleland have no plans to sue.

On March 26, thousands rallied outside the &lt;a href="w%3AColumbus%2C%20Ohio"&gt;Columbus, Ohio&lt;/a&gt; statehouse, advocating rights for undocumented immigrants. This was one of a series of rallies following one in &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%2C%20California"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, which was reported to have drawn over 500,000 attendees.

The sponsoring coalition included the Immigrant Worker Project, the Farm Labor Organizing Committee (FLOC), UFCW Local 880, MIGUATE (of [Dover, Ohio]), and the Red [network] de Inmigrantes de Ohio. Organizers wanted to raise awareness of bill pending in the US Senate, HR 4437, which would make it a felony to be an illegal alien, or to assist aliens in entering or staying the country illegally. Organizers also called for "true" immigration reform plan that would provide a path to citizenship for all immigrant workers.

An attempt to have the &lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thai&lt;/a&gt; police bring charges against current caretaker Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AThaksin%20Shinawatra"&gt;Thaksin Shinawatra&lt;/a&gt; has resulted in the police forwarding the allegations brought by the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) to the National Counter-Corruption Commission (NCCC).

The accusations centre around the attempted privatisation of EGAT, the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand. The privatisation process was derailed last week with the ruling issued by the country's Supreme Administrative court. They struck down two royal decrees that had been written to allow listing the utility company on the &lt;a href="w%3AStock%20Exchange%20of%20Thailand"&gt;Stock Exchange of Thailand&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3ASondhi%20Limthongkul"&gt;Sondhi Limthongkul&lt;/a&gt;, one of the main representatives of the PAD, delivered the complaint to police secretary Maj-Gen Prawut Thavornsiri on Monday. According to the Thai News Agency, the accusation that the legislation attempting to privatise EGAT was an act of malfeasance has been forwarded to the NCCC by the police.

With PAD protesters using every tactic they can think of to remove the caretaker PM ahead of this Sunday's election, the street demonstrations that have characterised the protests since before the announcement of the snap election have moved. Now focussing on the business areas of &lt;a href="w%3ABangkok"&gt;Bangkok&lt;/a&gt;, today's protest centred on Siam Paragon, an up-market retail complex where protesters sought to bring their anti-Thaksin message to shoppers.

Early exit polls for the Israeli parliamentary elections suggest that the newly formed &lt;a href="w%3AKadima"&gt;Kadima&lt;/a&gt; party of Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AAriel%20Sharon"&gt;Ariel Sharon&lt;/a&gt; and Acting PM &lt;a href="w%3AEhud%20Olmert"&gt;Ehud Olmert&lt;/a&gt; managed to capture between 28 and 32 seats in the 17th Knesset with &lt;a href="w%3AIsraeli%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Labor&lt;/a&gt; coming in second with 20 to 22 seats ahead of &lt;a href="w%3AYisrael%20Beiteinu"&gt;Yisrael Beiteinu&lt;/a&gt; with 12 to 14 seats. &lt;a href="w%3ALikud"&gt;Likud&lt;/a&gt; got 11 or 12 seats, the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Religious%20Party"&gt;National Religious Party&lt;/a&gt; took 8 or 9 seats and &lt;a href="w%3AShas"&gt;Shas&lt;/a&gt; 10 or 11 seats. The Pensioners party performed better than expected, capturing 6 to 8 seats, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Torah%20Judaism"&gt;United Torah Judaism&lt;/a&gt; got 5 to 6 seats and &lt;a href="w%3AMeretz"&gt;Meretz&lt;/a&gt; around 5 seats. Arab parties are expected to get 7 or 8 seats.

The results mean that Olmert could probably form a center-left coaltion to implement his unilateral disengagement plan for the &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Bank"&gt;West Bank&lt;/a&gt;.

"Kadima has won today. The next prime minister is Ehud Olmert," said Roni Bar-On, a Member of the Knesset for Kadima. His party did worse than expected from opinion polls, which saw them at gaining about 40 seats.

"This a crisis unlike any that has ever hit Likud," said Dan Naveh, a senior MK of the party referring to Likud's fall from being one of the dominating Israeli parties in the last decades to finishing only 4th.

Correspondents for the BBC stress that Israeli exit polls are considered to be relatively unreliable, and that it may take some time to get definitive results.

The &lt;a href="w%3ABeatles"&gt;Beatles&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href="w%3AApple%20Corps"&gt;Apple Corps&lt;/a&gt; has filed a lawsuit against computer and electronics maker &lt;a href="Apple%20Computer"&gt;Apple Computer&lt;/a&gt; in a London court this week, the third such lawsuit in a long running &lt;a href="w%3Atrademark"&gt;trademark&lt;/a&gt; dispute between the two companies. Apple Corps claims that Apple Computer's &lt;a href="w%3AiTunes%20Music%20Store"&gt;iTunes Music Store&lt;/a&gt; violates an agreement reached between the two companies in 1991, which barred Apple Computer from using the "Apple" &lt;a href="w%3Abrand"&gt;brand&lt;/a&gt; in certain uses in the music business.

The trial is set to begin on Wednesday in the &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Courts%20of%20Justice"&gt;Royal Courts of Justice&lt;/a&gt;, located in central London. Presiding Judge Martin Mann has stated that he owns an &lt;a href="w%3AiPod"&gt;iPod&lt;/a&gt; portable music player, which is made by Apple Computer and marketed alongside the iTunes Music Store.

Apple Corps has twice before sued Apple Computer over its use of the "Apple" name. The first lawsuit was settled out of court in 1981, with the young computer maker paying $80,000 and agreeing to stay out of the music business.

In the late 1980's Apple Computer added audio recording abilities to its &lt;a href="w%3AApple%20Macintosh"&gt;Macintosh&lt;/a&gt; computers, prompting Apple Corps to file suit again in 1989. That lawsuit was settled in 1991, also out of court, with Apple paying $26.5 million. The settlement included a more specific agreement over the boundaries between the two brands: Apple Computer was allowed to use its name to market "goods or services...used to reproduce, run, play or otherwise deliver such &lt;nowiki&gt;[music]&lt;/nowiki&gt; content," but barred from distributing music on a physical medium such as CD or cassette.

Apple Corps' latest suit, filed in September 2003, claims that the computer company violated the 1991 agreement with its iTunes Music Store, which sells digital music that can be downloaded to personal computers. A statement from Apple Computer stated that "Apple and Apple Corps now have differing interpretations of this agreement and will need to ask a court to resolve this dispute." Some observers have suggested that the wording of the 1991 agreement, which did not explicitly bar digital music distribution, could be to Apple Computer's advantage.

A similar suit was filed simultaneously in California, Apple Computer's home state, but on September 21, 2004 the parties agreed to have the case heard by the UK court.

Beatles songs have not been licensed for digital download on any of the &lt;a href="w%3AOnline%20music%20store"&gt;online music services&lt;/a&gt;.

Apple Corps was founded by the Beatles in 1968. Apple Computer was started by &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Jobs"&gt;Steve Jobs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Wozniak"&gt;Steve Wozniak&lt;/a&gt; in 1976, and launched the iTunes Music Store in 2003.

The US &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Reserve"&gt;Federal Reserve&lt;/a&gt; has raised the &lt;a href="w%3Afederal%20funds%20rate"&gt;federal funds rate&lt;/a&gt; by 25 basis points (a quarter of a percent) to 4.75%. The &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Open%20Market%20Committee"&gt;Federal Open Market Committee&lt;/a&gt; said, "Economic growth has rebounded strongly in the current quarter but appears likely to moderate to a more sustainable pace." The commmittee also said that the recent rise in energy prices has had a small effect on inflation and increasing productivity has offset growing labor costs which has helped keep inflation modest. 
However, the rise indicates the advent for future wariness over the state of the economy, with huge budget deficits yet to ofset it seams unlikely that the rates will decrease in forthcoming years, The federal chairman Ben Bernanke appeared at the senate board in the pursuit to implicitly state the statusquo worries.

The Leader of the Opposition, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKim%20Beazley"&gt;Kim Beazley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Labor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Brand"&gt;Brand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) supported the motion, and congratulated the move to put &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeneral%20officer"&gt;General&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Cosgrove"&gt;Peter Cosgrove&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in charge of operations, stating that soldiers "know how to work through logistics issues...how to work around officialdom or blockages", praised both local federal and state members of Parliament, and especially the Labor Queensland state premier, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Beattie"&gt;Peter Beattie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Katter thanked Beattie for his immediate response, but also described his confrontation with him and said how first responses were "simply not working", but also praised Beattie's decision on Cosgrove. Katter also described how the incident was "the worst natural disaster in
Australian history" and how the banana industry in north Queensland was decimated. Katter went on to describe the financial problems of the people in the region, the "huge gap" between the cost of rebuilding and insurance payouts, also asking "Are we going to pay people virtually nothing to sit on their backsides to do nothing or are we going to pay them a decent wage and have them rebuilding our communities for us?"

The debate is set to continue in the Main Committee, as an opportunity for many more members of the House of Representatives to speak to the motion, without taking up further time in the Chamber.

Criticism was targeted to Government efforts in the affair of the Jian Seng in the &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; March 28 and 29 over the handling of the ghost
ship, the tanker ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AJian%20Seng"&gt;Jian Seng&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, which was found abandoned and unlit in
the &lt;a href="w%3AGulf%20of%20Carpentaria"&gt;Gulf of Carpentaria&lt;/a&gt;.

Senator &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Ludwig"&gt;Joe Ludwig&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Labor&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="Queensland"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt;) asked of the Minister for Justice and Customs Senator
&lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Ellison"&gt;Chris Ellison&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AQuestion%20Time"&gt;Question Time&lt;/a&gt; whether he stood by his claim that
he made yesterday that the discovery of the Jian Seng demonstrated that the
Australian Government had in place "aerial and maritime surveillance to
intercept a vessel in these circumstances, and that was done", and asked why it
took the Government two weeks to intercept the vessel after it entered
Australian waters. Senator Ellison responded that at the vessel's first
sighting on March 8 "it was not doing anything illegal", and criticised the
Opposition's claim that the ship was drifting for seventeen days, saying
that "it was not stated as having drifted for the whole of the 17 days". Ludwig
went on to note that it was not Customs that spotted the ship but a "passing
Australian barge", but Ellison had defended this, stating that Ludwig "thinks
that commercial vessels have absolutely no role in looking out for Australia"
and that Ellison will "rely on reports to our hotline and go out and inspect
vessels".

Later, Senator &lt;a href="Kerry%20O%27Brien"&gt;Kerry O'Brien&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Labor&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="Tasmania"&gt;Tasmania&lt;/a&gt;) criticised the Government's implementation of coastal defense,
and highlighted the dangers of ignoring the ship for seventeen days, saying
that "it posed and possibly still poses unknown environmental and quarantine
risks" and that the ♡❤Jian Seng♡❤ "has been refused admission to Weipa
harbour...It could have been carrying literally anything. It could have been
carrying chemicals. It could have been carrying guns".

Senator &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Johnston"&gt;David Johnston&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Liberal%20Party"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="Western%20Australia"&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt;) went on to debate that there are no shipping lanes in
the area where the ♡❤Jian Seng♡❤ was found, and that devoting resources to a
harmless ship would leave gaps in the coastal defenses elsewhere.

According to a statement by a police officer sent to &lt;a href="w%3ARaoul_Island"&gt;Raoul Island&lt;/a&gt; in order to find the body of Mark Kearny, 33, who worked on researches on volcanoes on Raoul Island, Kearny was checking the temperature of the crater lake on March 17 when it erupted, blowing trees over, throwing boulders into the air, and burying the surrounding area in mud up to 5m deep.
A team of specialists has been sent to the island, but it is likely that the immense heat has destroyed the body of Mr Kearny.

As many as 1.5 million government workers, members of 11 unions, went on strike on Tuesday in protest of a government decision to reduce their retirement benefits, a change which would take effect in October.

The strike closed thousands of schools, libraries and leisure centres, disrupted commuters, and reduced some facilities to emergency only staffing.

UNISON claimed that more than a million workers had joined the strike, with General Secretary Dave Prentis saying "this overwhelming show of strength from Lands End to John O'Groats has obviously taken the Local Government Association and some local councils by surprise".

The benefits change, would effect the "85 year rule," of the Local Government Pension scheme, which allows government employees to retire at 60 as long as the sum of their age and their years of employment sum to 85 or greater. According to union representatives, the new retirement plan is targeted at lower paid employees, leaving higher paid employees to enjoy the same benefits as before.

Ahead of the strike, the Local Government Association claimed that the changes proposed by unions "would add at least 2% a year to every council taxpayer's bill".

The participating unions point out this is likely to be the largest strike in &lt;a href="UK"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt; since 1926.

According to the governor of &lt;a href="w%3ADarfur"&gt;Darfur&lt;/a&gt;, Swedish Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs &lt;a href="w%3ACarin%20J%C3%A4mtin"&gt;Carin Jämtin&lt;/a&gt; is not welcome in the region due to &lt;a href="w%3ASweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;'s involvement in the &lt;a href="w%3AJyllands-Posten%20Muhammad%20cartoons%20controversy"&gt;Mohammed Cartoons controversy&lt;/a&gt;. Her planned visit has now been cancelled for security reasons. Jämtin's press secretary, John Zanchi, believes that the true motivation is that Darfur's governor wants as little foreign involvement as possible in the &lt;a href="w%3ADarfur%20conflict"&gt;local conflict&lt;/a&gt;. Sweden has been actively working to send UN peacekeepers to the region.

Jämtin had earlier stated a desire to visit Darfur after receiving worrying reports of the humanitarian situation there. Her visit had been cleared by the government in Khartoum. The Foreign Minister will continue her trip to other parts of &lt;a href="w%3ASudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt;, including a visit to the Vice President.

The Czech capital, &lt;a href="Prague"&gt;Prague&lt;/a&gt;, is preparing for the flood and flood defences are being set up along Vltava shores. Many locals are watching the rising river, remembering the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2002%20European%20Flood"&gt;catastrophic floods of 2002&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Currently a quarter of the record flow of 2002 is flowing in Vltava. Further development depends on weather - if the melting does not combine with heavy rains, the floods are not expected to cause catastrophic damage.

<h1>President Bush to limit congressional oversight in PATRIOT amendment act</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=President%20Bush%20to%20limit%20congressional%20oversight%20in%20PATRIOT%20amendment%20act&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

President Bush signed the "USA PATRIOT Act Additional Reauthorizing Amendments Act of 2006" into law. In the signing statement, Bush averred that he could withhold information about the administration's controversial use of &lt;a href="w%3AForeign%20Intelligence%20Surveillance%20Act"&gt;Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act&lt;/a&gt; powers and &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Security%20Letters"&gt;National Security Letters&lt;/a&gt; if he deemed that they impaired foreign relations, national security, the deliberative processes of the Executive, or the performance of the Executive's constitutional duties. Lawmakers and Legal experts have questioned the president's authority to contravene the Congress's intent in such a way. 

The Patriot Act reauthorisation bill specifically mandates the &lt;a href="w%3AInspector%20General"&gt;Inspector General&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Justice"&gt;Department of Justice&lt;/a&gt; to audit the administration's use of investigative authority granted by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and National Security Letters and requires these audits to be submitted for congressional review. 

In the signing statement, President Bush wrote "The executive branch shall construe the provisions of H.R. 3199 that call for furnishing information to entities outside the executive branch, such as sections 106A and 119, in a manner consistent with the President's constitutional authority to supervise the unitary executive branch and to withhold information the disclosure of which could impair foreign relations, national security, the deliberative processes of the Executive, or the performance of the Executive's constitutional duties."

This follows on the heels of the signing of the congressional ban on torture issued in January of this year, when the President declared that he would view the interrogation limits in the context of his broader powers to protect national security. A senior white house official told a Boston Globe reporter that "Of course the president has the obligation to follow this law, [but] he also has the obligation to defend and protect the country as the commander in chief, and he will have to square those two responsibilities in each case." The official added "We are not expecting that those two responsibilities will come into conflict, but it's possible that they will."

Lawmakers tried to get a handle on President Bush's use of signing statements in 2003, by passing a Justice Department spending bill that required the department to inform Congress whenever the administration decided to ignore a legislative provision on constitutional grounds.

Bush signed the bill, but issued a statement asserting his right to ignore the notification requirement. 

<h2>Responses</h2>
Sen. &lt;a href="w%3ALindsey%20Graham"&gt;Lindsey Graham&lt;/a&gt;, (R-S.C.) voiced concern over the way national security is being used as a catch all phrase in this and a number of other signing statements, saying "If you take this to its logical conclusion, because during war the commander in chief has an obligation to protect us, any statute on the books could be summarily waived,"

David Golove, a New York University law professor who specializes in executive power issues, said "On the one hand, they deny that Congress even has the authority to pass laws on these subjects like torture and eavesdropping, and in addition to that, they say that Congress is not even entitled to get information about anything to do with the war on terrorism."

Sen &lt;a href="w%3AArlen%20Specter"&gt;Arlen Specter&lt;/a&gt;, (R-Pa) chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee argued "He (Bush) can say whatever he likes, I don't know if that has a whole lot of impact on the statute. Statutes are traditionally a matter of congressional intent," 

Sen &lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20J.%20Leahy"&gt;Patrick J. Leahy&lt;/a&gt;, (D-Ver) said in a prepared statement: "The president's signing statements are not the law, and Congress should not allow them to be the last word, The president's constitutional duty is to faithfully execute the laws as written by the Congress, not cherry-pick the laws he decides he wants to follow. It is our duty to ensure, by means of congressional oversight, that he does so.

<h2>Signing Statements</h2>
The signing statement is a written proclamation, issued by the president of the United Sates that accompany the signing of a law passed by the legislative branch and generally sets forth how the executive branch intends to interpret and enforce the new law. 

The use of signing statements started with the US's fifth President James Monroe (1817-1825) and from that time was used sparingly. In fact from Monroe to Jimmy Carter (39 th President 1977-1981) there were a total of a 109 signing statements issued, 75 of which were to protect presidential prerogatives and 34 were to instruct the executive branch agencies on the interpretation of sections of the law. Whereas from the Reagan administration through the Clinton administration there were a total of 396 signing statements made with 322 to protect presidential prerogative and 74 to instruct on presidential interpretation of the law. Following along this sharp increase the Bush administration issued 435 statements almost entirely objecting to encroachments upon presidential prerogatives. 
The key argument involved here is in the interpretation of the constitution. The Bush administration is acting from on an idea called the Unitary Executive theory - you may have noticed it is mentioned twice in his signing statement - this theory holds that all three branches of the federal government have the power and duty to interpret the Constitution and that the meaning of the Constitution is determined through the dynamic interaction of all three branches.

This idea gained strength during the Reagan administration as a response to the presidency having been severely weakened by Vietnam and, Watergate and is mainly championed by the "Federalist Society," a group of conservative lawyers who nearly all worked in the Nixon, Ford, and Reagan white houses. It largely claims its authority from two sources within the Constitution—the "Oath" and "Take Care" clauses of Article II. The "Oath" requirement acts as a sort of shield, protecting the president from enforcing things he independently determines are unconstitutional, and the "Oath" clause directs the president to "faithfully execute the Office of the President and [to] preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States." 

Acting on this theory, then deputy assistant attorney general in the Office of Legal Counsel &lt;a href="Samuel%20Alito"&gt;Samuel Alito&lt;/a&gt; wrote a draft memo on Feb. 5, 1986 outlining a strategy for strengthening presidential authority. It laid out a case for having the president routinely issue statements about the meaning of statutes when he signs them into law. He explained his thoughts this way:

"Since the president's approval is just as important as that of the House or Senate, it seems to follow that the president's understanding of the bill should be just as important as that of Congress," He later added that "by forcing some rethinking by courts, scholars, and litigants, it may help to curb some of the prevalent abuses of legislative history." 

Phillip Cooper, a professor of public administration at Portland State University states his objection to this; "It's nothing short of breath-taking. In every case, the White House has interpreted presidential authority as broadly as possible, interpreted legislative authority as narrowly as possible, and preempted the judiciary. 

The office of legal consul under President Clinton declared: "If the President may properly decline to enforce a law, at least when it unconstitutionally encroaches on his powers, then it arguably follows that he may properly announce to Congress and to the public that he will not enforce a provision of an enactment he is signing. If so, then a signing statement that challenges what the President determines to be an unconstitutional encroachment on his power, or that announces the President's unwillingness to enforce (or willingness to litigate) such a provision, can be a valid and reasonable exercise of Presidential authority."

In the last days before the &lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thai&lt;/a&gt; snap-election this Sunday, some activists seeking the removal of the now-caretaker Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AThaksin%20Shinawatra"&gt;Thaksin Shinawatra&lt;/a&gt; are urging voters to use the "No-vote" box on ballot papers.

A women's rights group issued their second statement on the subject, urging voters to turn up at polling stations and register their abstention. The statement from Women and the Constitution Network said, "We want the Thai people to go to the polls and exercise their voting right by choosing to abstain." An earlier statement had called for the beleaguered PM to resign. According to Thailand's &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Nation%20%28Thailand%29"&gt;The Nation&lt;/a&gt; other groups, including student organisations are urging voters to use the "no-vote" option.

Calling into question whether the election will result in a full parliament, the &lt;a href="w%3ABangkok%20Post"&gt;Bangkok Post&lt;/a&gt; claims to have information from a &lt;a href="w%3AThai%20Rak%20Thai"&gt;Thai Rak Thai&lt;/a&gt; party insider that around 100 of the 168 seats where they stand uncontested may not meet the minimum requirement that 20% of the eligble voters vote for the candidate. With less than the required 500 members in the lower house, ratification of a new Prime Minister will not be possible.

The &lt;a href="U.N."&gt;U.N.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUN%20Security%20Council"&gt;Security Council&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has unanimously approved a non-binding statement earlier today reaffirming its commitment to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20Non-Proliferation%20Treaty"&gt;Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NTP)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , including the right of NTP states to "develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination", and also calling for Iran to temporarily suspend this right &amp;mdash; including all activities related to uranium enrichment and reprocessing, including research and development activities &amp;mdash; in order to "&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AConfidence%20and%20Security-Building%20Measures"&gt;build confidence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the exclusively peaceful purpose of its nuclear programme and to resolve outstanding questions".

The five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council agreed on the statement earlier today. This is the first action by the Security Council over the alleged fears of some countries that Iran wants to join the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20countries%20with%20nuclear%20weapons"&gt;growing list&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of nations possessing nuclear weapons.

The Security Council requested that in addition to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIAEA"&gt;International Atomic Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's ongoing inspections in Iran, that it monitor Iran's compliance with "the steps required by the IAEA Board". &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, two members of the Security Council, have stated opposition to using force or imposing sanctions on Iran.

The IAEA was requested to file a report in thirty days' time.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABureau%20of%20Meteorology"&gt;Bureau of Meteorology&lt;/a&gt; has reported the occurrence of 100 Kilometres per hour (62 miles per hour) winds along the Pilbara Coast as Tropical &lt;a href="w%3ACyclone"&gt;Cyclone&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3A2005-06_Southern_Hemisphere_tropical_cyclone_season%23Severe_Tropical_Cyclone_Glenda"&gt;Glenda&lt;/a&gt; closes in.

At 8 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3ATime%20in%20Australia"&gt;WST&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday (1200 &lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated%20Universal%20Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;), the Bureau of Meteorology reported that Glenda had weakened and reclassified it as a category 4 storm. The Bureau of Meteorology expects Glenda will cross the coast between Exmouth and Karratha tonight.

The Bureau of Meteorology predicts gale force winds gusting up to 130 kilometres per hour (80 miles per hour) to develop in the affected region during the day. They predict that later, as the cyclone nears the coast that winds up to 250 kilometres an hour (155 miles per hour) will occur near the cyclone centre.

The bureau also warns of the possibility of a dangerous storm surge between Karatha and Onslow as the cyclone crosses the coast.They warn that tides are likely to rise above the normal high tide make causing flooding and damaging waves.

The Fire and Emergency Services Authority of Western Australia has placed residents in Karratha, Roebourne, Point Samson, Wickham, Dampier and Mardie on red alert. Residents are advised to:
<ul>
BULLET::::- Go to a welfare centre immediately if they are not already in a safe location

BULLET::::- Stay in the strongest part of the building they are in, away from windows
BULLET::::- Ensure pets and animals are safely sheltered
BULLET::::- Disconnect electrical appliances and turn off gas valves
BULLET::::- Ensure that neighbours have received the warning
BULLET::::- Stay indoors until given an "All Clear with Caution" alert from emergency services

</ul>
FESA has issued a blue alert for people between De Grey and Whim Creek including Port Hedland, South Hedland, Pannawonica, Onslow and Exmouth. A blue alert means that residents should begin taking precautions and making preparations for a possible red alert condition.

Yesterday in &lt;a href="Nigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;, former &lt;a href="Liberia"&gt;Liberia&lt;/a&gt;n president &lt;a href="Charles%20Taylor"&gt;Charles Taylor&lt;/a&gt; was arrested after being caught trying to flee the country. Nigeria had announced that it would allow Taylor's transfer to Liberia at the request of the new Liberian president &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEllen%20Johnson-Sirleaf"&gt;Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The government of &lt;a href="Nigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt; reported Taylor to be missing on Monday; they had made known earlier that day that they would not take responsibility for Taylor's arrest or transfer. After his flight however, he was arrested on the border of &lt;a href="Cameroon"&gt;Cameroon&lt;/a&gt; by Nigerian authorities who transferred him to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMonrovia"&gt;Monrovia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; where he was met by UN authorities who took him into custody. He is to be tried by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUN"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -backed &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASpecial%20Court%20for%20Sierra%20Leone"&gt;War Crimes Court&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for &lt;a href="Sierra%20Leone"&gt;Sierra Leone&lt;/a&gt; in Freetown.

Richard Dicker, director of the International Justice Program for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHuman%20Rights%20Watch"&gt;Human Rights Watch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , expressed enthusiasm over Taylor's capture: "This is an extraordinary moment for the people of West Africa. Taylor’s trial should bring long awaited justice to the victims of Sierra Leone’s brutal war and promote the rule of law in a region devastated by violence."

Chief prosecutor of the War Crimes Court, Desmond De Silva, commented: "Today is a momentous occasion, an important day for international justice, the international community, and above all the people of Sierra Leone." Taylor was exiled to Nigeria in August of 2003 after leading Liberia into a civil war.

Taylor will stand trial for allegedly having the "greatest responsibility" for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Awar%20crimes"&gt;war crimes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , crimes against humanity and other violations of international law perpetrated under his leadership; the specific charges include responsibility for murder, hostage taking, extermination, rape, murder, sexual slavery, and use of child soldiers.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Federal%20Police"&gt;Australian Federal Police&lt;/a&gt; officers reportedly raided the home in Argenton, West of &lt;a href="w%3ANewcastle%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Newcastle, New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; of a man suspected of distibuting software to enable unauthorised access to pay TV services Foxtel and Austar.

A spokesperson for the Australian Federal Police said that officers seized computer equipment, including an "external hardware drive". The spokesperson said police were assisted by Foxtel's fraud invesigators and computer forensic experts from Ferrier Hodgson.

Debra Richards, Executive Director of the Australian Subscription Television Association, the organisation which represents the interests of Australian pay TV service providers, said, "Industry members are working cooperatively through ASTRA to address a problem that results in lost revenue and resources that would otherwise be used to grow the Australian television and production industries." 

"The real victims here are the consumers who are being hoodwinked into being involved in a criminal activity, often paying more than they would otherwise for a legitimate service," she said.

&lt;a href="w%3AAhmed%20Omar%20Abu%20Ali"&gt;Ahmed Omar Abu Ali&lt;/a&gt;, a 25-year-old U.S. citizen, was sentenced by a U.S. district court judge to 30 years in prison on Tuesday for plotting to assassinate United States President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;. Ali, a self-proclaimed member of &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Qaeda"&gt;Al Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;, was arrested by &lt;a href="w%3ASaudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi&lt;/a&gt; officials in 2003 at the Islamic University of Medina.

Prosecutors had originally asked for a life sentence, but the judge said that the 30-year sentence was adequate, comparing the case to the "American Taliban" &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Walker%20Lindh"&gt;John Lindh&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, the judge pointed out that Ali's actions "did not result in one single actual victim. That fact must be taken into account."

Ali had given a statement to Saudi officials after his capture stating that he had joined Al Qaeda and talked with its senior members about plots to assassinate the President and to establish a terrorist cell in the United States. He asserted that his confession had been obtained through torture.

The New Zealand Government's energy efficiency strategy has been considered ineffective and will hence be replaced in 2007. Energy Minister Trevor Mallard and the Government's spokeswoman on energy efficiency Jeanette Fitzsimons announced that the four-year-old National Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategy would be revamped. Originally, this strategy was meant to achieve a 20 per cent improvement of the energy efficiency rate and increase renewable energy supply by 30 &lt;a href="w%3AJoule"&gt;petajoules&lt;/a&gt; until 2012.

A mentally ill New Zealand man who had been accused this week of biting off his elderly mother's finger and gouging her eyes has been found dead. The 41-year-old man died in a mental health unit in Hamilton overnight apparently from natural causes, police said.

He was accused of having attacked his 73-year old mother by biting off a finger and gouging her eyes. It is certain that she will become blind in at least one eye. The man, 41, was due to appear in Rotorua District Court earlier this week but was not considered to be mentally stable. He has been diagnosed schizophrenic before.

The EU's commissioner in charge of competition, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANeelie%20Kroes"&gt;Neelie Kroes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , wrote to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Ballmer"&gt;Steve Ballmer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , CEO of Microsoft, last week informally warning him that Microsoft's plans to include security features, search tools, copyright protection services and an application to create documents similar to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAdobe"&gt;Adobe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APortable%20Document%20Format"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; files into Vista would violate European antitrust laws, according to her spokesman Jonathan Todd.

Mr. Todd said that the commission was worried that features Microsoft plans to include in Vista may prevent customers from choosing their own software combinations. He emphasised that the letter was not a signal of a formal antitrust inquiry into Windows Vista.

The commission wrote the letter following a letter from Microsoft asking them to indicate if there were any possible competition issues with the new system. Mr. Todd said: "We assume that Microsoft has its own interests at heart. It wants to launch another product without having to worry about the Commission instituting various actions under antitrust law." 

Microsoft's top lawyer in Europe, Horacio Guttierez, said Wednesday that adding such functions into the operating system was essential if Microsoft was to meet customer demand. "I know consumers want more secure computer systems," he said.
Windows Vista includes software called Windows Defender, which seeks out and removes &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aspyware"&gt;spyware&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and adware. Guttierez claims that forcing Microsoft to sell Windows without Defender "is a bit like forcing BMW to sell cars without airbags".

"We have a responsibility to make our products better and more secure for our customers," he said.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFighting%20words"&gt;Fighting words&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; were exchanged in the &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href="Australian%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; over the matter of the division of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMedicare%20%28Australia%29"&gt;Medicare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; safety net payments per electorate. The Minister for Health and Ageing &lt;a href="Tony%20Abbott"&gt;Tony Abbott&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Liberal%20Party"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Warringah"&gt;Warringah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) had introduced a policy that the Government would pay Medicare users up to a fixed amount &amp;mdash; the safety net &amp;mdash; to help in addressing "gaps" in certain payments which Medicare would not cover, such as certain hospital payments. The Opposition was opposed to the idea on efficacy counts.

Abbott was asked a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADorothy%20Dixer"&gt;Dorothy Dixer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AQuestion%20Time"&gt;Question Time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; today about the benefits of the safety net. He alleged that criticism by the Opposition Health spokeswoman &lt;a href="Julia%20Gillard"&gt;Julia Gillard&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Labor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Lalor"&gt;Lalor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) that the safety net favoured Liberal/&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20National%20Party"&gt;National Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; coalition electorates was misleading as it was a Labor electorate, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Grayndler"&gt;Grayndler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that received the "highest safety net benefits per electorate".

This led Gillard to make a personal explanation after Question Time, stating that "the top four electorates receiving money under the Medicare safety net are &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Wentworth"&gt;Wentworth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20North%20Sydney"&gt;North Sydney&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Bradfield"&gt;Bradfield&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Warringah"&gt;Warringah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; " &amp;mdash; all coalition electorates. The Leader of the Opposition, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKim%20Beazley"&gt;Kim Beazley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Labor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Brand"&gt;Brand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ), put a question to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASpeaker%20of%20the%20Australian%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;Speaker of the House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Hawker"&gt;David Hawker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Liberal%20Party"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Wannon"&gt;Wannon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) asking of the Speaker his "assurance that no person is being deliberately misled by the actions of any other person". 

Abbott had then interjected towards Beazley, saying "You big bellowing cow"; the Speaker asked Abbott to withdraw, but Abbott mentioned that "the Leader of the Opposition regularly interjects 'pompous ass' and 'goose', but I am happy to withdraw". Beazley then responded through the Speaker saying of Abbott, "I think that he is a sleazy, dummy-spitting, little git."

Abbott then made a personal explanation of his own, saying "The safety net benefit per person in the electorate of the member for Grayndler was $591, the highest in New South Wales...the safety net benefit in the electorate of Sydney was $589, the second highest...the benefit in the electorate of Lowe was $458, the third highest".

The matter was not further raised at the time, but after the Matter of Public Importance debate, Gillard moved a motion to suspend standing orders which would prevent Abbott from explaining his earlier claim "when this claim is totally untrue", to correct the "grossly inaccurate and misleading statement", to "apologise to all Members in this place" and to "apologize to the Member for Grayndler and his constituents". Gillard also listed the amounts of payments "released by the Minister himself", that Wentworth received $7.8 million, North Sydney received $7.5 million, Bradfield received $6.9 million, Warringah received $6.3 million; whereas Grayndler received only $3.6 million. She attempted to debate the motion but a gag motion to silence Gillard was moved and won because of Government numbers. &lt;a href="Anthony%20Albanese"&gt;Anthony Albanese&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Labor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; member for Grayndler attempted to second the motion but the gag was moved on him as well. The final vote on the motion was lost 55 to 79.

<h1>Captors release American journalist Jill Carroll</h1>

&lt;a href="w%3AJill%20Carroll"&gt;Jill Carroll&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; journalist, has been released by her captors after having been held for 82 days.

Caroll was abducted on January 7, 2006 in &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad%2C%20Iraq"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt; by gunmen and was dropped off by unknown individuals at the &lt;a href="w%3AIraqi%20Islamic%20Party"&gt;Iraqi Islamic Party's&lt;/a&gt; branch office in the western part of the Amariyah district in Baghdad. Her translator was killed during the abduction, but her driver escaped.

Carroll is a freelance journalist who writes for the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20Science%20Monitor"&gt;Christian Science Monitor&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

"She was released this morning; she's talked to her father and she's fine. This is a wonderful day," said David Cook, chief of The ♡❤Christian Science Monitor's♡❤ Washington bureau.

"She is OK. She is safe. She is more or less scared. I told her calm down and we would take care of her," said Tariq al-Hashimi, the party's secretary general.

"I'm really grateful she was released and thank those who worked hard for her release, and we're glad she's alive," said &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;.

Earlier, her captives threatened to kill Carroll if all Iraqi women prisoners were not released from prisons in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;.

"I am just happy to be free. I just want to be with my family quickly," said Carroll. "I was treated well. It's important people know that. I was not harmed, they never said they would hit me."

Carroll had written that she had gone to &lt;a href="Jordan"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt; to "learn as much about the region as possible before the fighting began." She arrived in the &lt;a href="w%3AMiddle%20East"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt; in 2002 to cover the Iraq war.

"There was bound to be plenty of parachute journalism once the war started, and I didn't want to be a part of that," added Carroll.

One week ago, three peace activists were released during a British-led operation in Iraq. Jim Loney and Harmeet Singh Sooden, both &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canadians&lt;/a&gt; and Norman Kember a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; man were released on March 23, 2006. A fourth member of the group, Tom Fox from the U.S., was shot dead and found earlier in March in Baghdad. They were members of a group called Christian Peacemaker Teams.

Pontes, who flies for the Brazilian Air Force, was joined on the trip by Russian cosmonaut Pavel Vinogradov and U.S. astronaut Jeffrey Williams. The Russian and U.S. astronauts will be spending the next six months onboard the ISS. In ten days Pontes will return along with outgoing astronauts American Bill McArthur and Russian Valery Tokarev.

An outage of , believed to have occurred due to a problem during realignment of the satellite has resulted in a loss of service to all subscribers of 's Digital service, an estimated 550,000 people &lt;a href="http%3A//www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm%3Fc_id%3D1%26amp%3BObjectID%3D10375329"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Sky TV's terrestrial UHF service is unaffected.

Users of the digital service see a rain fade error message which is the standard error message that occurs when signal is lost on Sky's Digital set-top boxes. Sky has temporarily removed the scrambling of their terrestrial UHF Sky Sport channel, allowing anyone able to receive the signal to view the channel (regardless of whether they are subscribers to any of Sky's services). There are 3 other pay TV UHF channels operated by Sky but none of the others have been unscrambled. Original media reports suggest the unscrambling of Sky Sport 1 was done as the award ceremony was being held that evening, however the channel remains unscrambled after the end of the awards ceremony. Sky Sport 1 is probably one of the most popular Sky channels and provides coverage of including matches which will be played during the weekend beginning in the evening of 31 March 2006.

The outage began at around 30 March 2006 1850 NZST and is ongoing as at 31 March 2006 0755 NZST. However service has been partially restored as of 0820 NZST. It appears the satellite is still under realignment as not all channels work and with some the signal quality is poor. Certain channels that were available as of 0820 NZST were no longer available as of 0835 NZST.

Sky's website &lt;a href="http%3A//www.sky.co.nz/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; briefly went down and when it returned has been modified to include a special front page mentioning the outage &lt;a href="http%3A//www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm%3Fc_id%3D1%26amp%3BObjectID%3D10375329"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Their phone service was frequently overloaded (engaged) and plays a message mentioning the outage in a continuous loop with normal voice prompts removed.

According to Sky's media release &lt;a href="http%3A//www.skytv.co.nz/index.cfm%3Fpageid%3D469%26amp%3Bscript%3Dnewsrelease%26amp%3Bdsp%3Dnr%26amp%3Bnewsid%3D196%26amp%3Bnrcontent%3D0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Optus B1 is still contacting Optus's ground stations and Optus is currently attempting to realign the satellite. Early media reports had indicated the satellite could be uncontactable &lt;a href="http%3A//www.geekzone.co.nz/content.asp%3Fcontentid%3D6102"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and a report on nightly news programme quoted experts suggesting that it is possible the satellite potentially could not be properly realigned. Earlier reports had also quoted a Sky spokesperson suggesting the problem could be fixed by midnight &lt;a href="http%3A//newswire.co.nz/main/viewstory.aspx%3Fstoryid%3D309872%26amp%3Bcatid%3D0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

The outage has also affected other services using the Optus B1 satellite believed to include some air traffic control functions, some interbank transmissions and also the New Zealand Fire Service in-fill paging service &lt;a href="http%3A//www.geekzone.co.nz/content.asp%3Fcontentid%3D6102"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Other broadcasters using the satellite include who offer both their TV channels free to air via the satellite and the Australian and . JuiceTV, a free-to-air terrestrial UHF music channel provided by Sky is also not broadcasting instead displaying the rain-fade error message. which is community broadcast in Auckland is also affected as it originates from a free to air broadcast from the satellite.

It has also been reported that the Radio Network analog radio channels have been affected throughout the country &lt;a href="http%3A//www.nbr.co.nz/home/column_article.asp%3Fid%3D14829%26amp%3Bcid%3D1%26amp%3Bcname%3DMedia"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and that users of Sky's MySky box are unable to use the box even to watch prerecorded shows as the box needs a connection to the satellite to operate &lt;a href="http%3A//home.nzcity.co.nz/news/default.asp%3Fid%3D60831%26amp%3Bc%3Dw"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

The nightly news programme report also mentioned that several pubs had had reduced patronage due to the loss of the sport broadcasting or racing. reported loss of patronage in at least one pub &lt;a href="http%3A//www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm%3Fc_id%3D1%26amp%3BObjectID%3D10375329"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. However the channel which provides coverage of racing events also broadcasts free to air on UHF in cooperation with Sky TV and appeared unaffected at 2245 NZT.

The Optus B1 satellite is 14 years old and is considered in urgent need of replacement as it lost its primary SCP on 21 May 2005 &lt;a href="http%3A//www.tbs-satellite.com/tse/online/sat_optus_b1.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and is now running on the one and only backup SCP. It has an intended lifespan of between 10 to 15 years. However the launch of the replacement satellite of the Optus D class was delayed in August 2005 &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optus_Fleet_of_Satellites"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but are now intended to be launched in June 2006 &lt;a href="http%3A//www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm%3Fc_id%3D1%26amp%3BObjectID%3D10375329"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Sky TV is the predominant pay TV broadcaster in New Zealand and the only one who use satellite. The only other pay TV broadcaster of any significance is who operate a cable network in and reaching an estimated 160,000 households with a reported 62,000 subscribers to their network (this figure likely includes customers who do not subcribe to their TV service). They also provide access to several of Sky's channels. World TV &lt;a href="http%3A//www.wtv.co.nz"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; offers several Asian channels using the Sky Network. Mirchee TV &lt;a href="http%3A//www.mircheetv.co.nz/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; offer several channels targeting the south Asian market via a terrestrial setup using satellite receiving equipement.

At present, an on is attempting to sell the satellite.

U.S. Representative &lt;a href="w%3ACynthia_McKinney"&gt;Cynthia McKinney&lt;/a&gt; (D-GA) allegedly punched a Capitol Hill police officer in the chest after he grabbed her arm. The officer was pursuing her after she failed to pass through the metal detector, which House Members are not required to do.

McKinney has complained about government security in the past. She protested about being stopped in 1993 and 1995. In 1996 and 1998, she complained that White House security didn't treat her the same as her white colleagues. At one time, a security officer mistook her 23-year-old white aide for the congresswoman. She is quoted on the Hill as having said, at one, "I am absolutely sick and tired of having to have my appearance at the White House validated by white people."

McKinney has been one of the most vocal critics of the 9/11 reviews and she hosted a July 22nd, 2005 Congressional Briefing: "The 9/11 Commission Report One Year Later: A Citizens' Response - Did They Get It Right?"

Several weeks ago &lt;a href="w%3ANetherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; based company &lt;a href="w%3AMittal%20Steel"&gt;Mittal Steel&lt;/a&gt; made a takeover bid for &lt;a href="w%3AArcelor"&gt;Arcelor&lt;/a&gt;, prompting legislation from &lt;a href="w%3ALuxembourg"&gt;Luxembourg&lt;/a&gt; (5.6% owners of Arcelor, the largest stockholders) and cries of discrimination from &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;.

Mittal is owned by the world's fifth wealthiest man, &lt;a href="w%3ALaskshmi%20Mittal"&gt;Laskshmi Mittal&lt;/a&gt;, an Indian. After the takeover bid, the Luxembourg Chamber of Commerce attempted to introduce new rules that would stop companies with less than 25% of their shares in free float from making a cash and bid offer for a company whose location is in Luxembourg. India news reports then claimed that this was a discriminatory action because Laskshmi Mittal is an Indian.

Luxembourg officials have disputed this, stating that their actions were only due to the need to comply with &lt;a href="w%3AEU"&gt;EU&lt;/a&gt; legislation. The country's minister for economy and foreign trade, &lt;a href="w%3ALeannot%20Krecke"&gt;Leannot Krecke&lt;/a&gt;, stated, "The government will have no role in impeding the bid. We intend to bring the takeover bill in May to put in the best international practices in our economy." Krecke also stated that a similar bill will have to be brought to the national governments of each of the 25 EU member nations so that they complied with EU legislation. 

Word of New Delhi's displeasure with Luxembourg's stance seems to have been translated to Luxembourg during a meeting that the finance ministers of both countries had in India. 

Meanwhile, Mittal has announced that it is prepared to cut the cash portion of its buyout offer. Mittal will do so if Arcelor increases its dividend to shareholders above the 80 cent market consensus. A spokesman for Mittal stated: "If Arcelor decides to distribute extra cash to shareholders, we will consider that as an advance payment on our offer and adjust the cash component of our offer accordingly."

At approximately 8 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3AEastern_European_Summer_Time"&gt;EEST&lt;/a&gt; (1700 &lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated_Universal_Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;) in &lt;a href="w%3ABahrain"&gt;Bahrain&lt;/a&gt;, a ferry that was believed to have been carrying about 150 tourists and locals was reported missing and overturned off the coast of Bahrain, near the Sheikh Khalifa Causeway Bridge, Sitra. The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; Fifth Fleet has been called in to help with the rescue.

Earlier reports from ♡❤Reuters♡❤ stated that at least 40 bodies had been found, but ♡❤ABC News♡❤ reported that at least 44 are dead.

"There are 52 survivors and there are also 44 dead (bodies) that were retrieved. So far, the (rescue) operations continue. God willing, there will be more survivors rescued," said Bahrain's Interior Minister Abdulla Al Khalifa.

One resident said, "I have seen at least 48 bodies," and ♡❤ABC News♡❤ reported at least 44 dead. However, "many on board were rescued," a Bahraini official was quoted as saying.

"The first report we received was that a Dhow (a wooden boat) has capsized. We are preparing a helicopter to join the rescue. There is no initial indication that this was an attack," said a U.S. Navy spokesman.

&lt;a href="w%3ACharlie%20Sheen"&gt;Charlie Sheen&lt;/a&gt;, appearing on cable television news network station ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ on March 24, questioned the credibility of the theory that 19 hijackers caused all of the destruction to the World Trade Center.

Sheen said; "♡❤It seems to me like, you know, 19 amateurs with box cutters taking over four commercial airliners and hitting 75 percent of their targets, that feels like a conspiracy theory… I am an American citizen that loves my country…. People want the truth. They want the truth. And what's been offered to us resembles nothing of the sort.♡❤"

In recounting his reaction on the day of the event, Sheen said,"I ♡❤was up early and we were gonna do a pre-shoot on Spin City, the show I used to do. I was watching the news and the north tower was burning. There was a feeling, it just didn't look like any commercial jetliner I've flown on any time in my life and then when the buildings came down later on that day I said to my brother, 'Call me insane but did it sorta look like those buildings came down in a controlled demolition?♡❤♡" 

Writer Marc Jacobson, of the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ magazine, who co-appeared with Sheen on the same program said in response: "♡❤Well, I think he's doing a reasonable rendition of what other people that believe in this stuff say. And when he says he has his facts straight, I mean, I think the facts are in question. I mean, I think, just because you know what it says on all of these different Web sites doesn't mean that that's necessarily the fact. That's the reason why the United States government, with their endless amounts of resources, let us down by not doing the proper work on the 9/11 Commission. That's a real problem. Well, you know, but, I mean, it's just one of those kind of things where you do this work and nobody really cares, but then Charlie Sheen is interested, so then everybody is interested, and that's fine. You know, obviously, this material needs to be looked at again, because there's been a lot of problems with the 9/11 Commission report. People feel it's not adequate. Most of the people who had lost people during that time feel it's not adequate. And it's just I think we're living in a truth vacuum, in a sense, that any time there's a truth vacuum, these ideas -- because people are smart. They put two and two together. Sometimes they get five; sometimes they get 12, but sometimes they get 11, like 9/11, but sometimes they get four. And the thing is that, if you have a situation where the so-called facts are covered up and aggressively covered up, then you're going to get these conspiracy theories.♡❤" One website is claiming that Google had been censoring out any news articles relating to Sheen and 9/11 from it's search engine.

Regarding the plane that hit the Pentagon, Sheen also has questions: "♡❤Just show us how this particular plane pulled off these maneuvers… It is up to us to reveal the truth. It is up to us because we owe it to the families, we owe it to the victims, we owe it to everyone's life who was drastically altered, horrifically, that day and forever. We owe it to them to uncover what happened.♡❤" 

Some supporters of Sheen's theories have complained about the lack of mainstream media coverage. They point to CNN's recent cancellation of Ed Asner's interview on Showbiz Tonight, where he was expected to support Sheen's position, as an example of the "media blackout". 

Marina Hyde of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Guardian"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ proposed a theory of her own with regard to Sheen: "Frankly, with dentistry as expensive as yours, you simply can't afford to let The Man stamp his jackboot down on your face, and so it is that when faced with the inquiry 'did Lee Harvey Oswald act alone?', you find yourself thinking: 'God, I mean… do any of us? Like, he had to have people, you know? At least an agent and a publicist.'"

With the actual poll only days away, &lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thailand's&lt;/a&gt; Administrative Court has ruled against a new requirement introduced by the country's Election Commission. Voters will not be forced to complete ballots with a rubber stamp and may instead use a pen.

Ruling that the change to require the use of a rubber stamp is in contravention of election law, Judge Anuwat Tharasawaeng highlighted that election law does not mandate how a mark must be made on the ballot.

&lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; has become the first western country to freeze aid and cut diplomatic ties to &lt;a href="w%3APalestine"&gt;Palestine&lt;/a&gt; after the Palestinian Legislative Council installed a government led by &lt;a href="w%3AHamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt;. No other country has yet followed through on threats to end aid to the Palestinian Authority. Aid may still go to Palestine through the United Nations.

The Canadian Arab Federation head, Faraj Nakhleh, later expressed his dismay at the decision, which he says will harm the interests of the 3.5 million Palestinians who are at risk of starvation.

Heavy rains have hit the main Hawaiian Islands for nearly six weeks, contributing to flooding in many places in the islands: a deadly dam break in northern Kauai, a sewage spill in Honolulu's Waikiki district, and record rainfall totals in many areas of the state. 

A series of upper-level storm systems have formed northwest of the island of Kauai, drawing tropical moisture from the south over Hawaii and forming areas of heavy rain and thunderstorms.

The island of Kauai, on which an earthen dam broke on March 7 killing seven people, has been hardest hit. Mount Waialeale, in the center of the island, has received 90 inches of rain during the month of March and 126.69 inches since the weather pattern began on February 19. 34.31 inches of rain had fallen at Lihue airport, the most rain in a single month since records started in 1950.

Tourism officials are concerned about the long-term effect that the heavy rains may have on tourism, and they expect to launch a marketing campaign once the weather improves.

The entire state remains under a flash flood watch until at least Saturday. Weather forecasters expect a return to normal weather patterns early next week.

At least 70 people are dead and hundreds more injured after three earthquakes and several aftershocks rocked western &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href="w%3ADorood"&gt;Doroud&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABorujerd"&gt;Boroujerd&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3ALorestan%20Province"&gt;Lorestan&lt;/a&gt; province at 11:06 p.m. local time (1936 GMT) on Thursday. Some estimates of those injured currently range between 700-1,200 people.

The first earthquake measured a 4.7 on the &lt;a href="w%3ARichter_magnitude_scale"&gt;Richter magnitude scale&lt;/a&gt; and was in a mountainous area and the second measured a 5.1. The third quake measured a 6.0 and hit Doroud and the villages surrounding the area at 4:47 a.m. local time (0117 GMT) on Friday.

According to the U.S. Geological Survey, however, a 5.7 magnitude quake occurred at 0117 &lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated_Universal_Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt; followed by an earthquake of 4.7 magnitude fifteen minutes later. They also report that the previous day, a quake measuring 4.7 in magnitude occurred in the same area.

Power has been cut to some areas and there are reports of at least 330 villages that have been severely damaged. Some reports say that at least 20 villages have been destroyed. Thousands have been left homeless as a result.

In December of 2003, a magnitude 6.6 earthquake killed over 31,000 people and in February of 2005 a 6.4 eathquake killed 600 people near Zarand in the &lt;a href="w%3AKerman_Province"&gt;Kerman&lt;/a&gt; province.

Jane Faust, former Republican committeewoman once convicted of forging signatures, was a plaintiff yesterday in Pennsylvania's Commonwealth Court (state court). Her lawyer, Larry Otter, argued that &lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Murphy%20%28politician%29"&gt;Patrick Murphy&lt;/a&gt; should be thrown off the ballot for the &lt;a href="w%3ADemocrat"&gt;Democratic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APrimary%20election"&gt;primary election&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives%2C%20Pennsylvania%20District%208"&gt;eighth congressional district&lt;/a&gt; of Pennsylvania. The eighth district is primarily located in &lt;a href="w%3ABucks%20County"&gt;Bucks County&lt;/a&gt;, Pennsylvania.

Otter argued that during the period of election petition signature collection, Murphy had signed his name as the circulator on two petition sheets, but was not present for each signature that was signed on those sheets, and thereby breaking Pennsylvania state law. Pennsylvania law states that whoever signs a petition sheet as a circulator must be present for each signature and see each signature placed on the sheet.

Murphy admitted that he was not at the sheet for every signature, and he agreed that the 96 signatures on those two sheets should be invalidated. He also stated that he was unaware of that particular election statute. Otter argued that the candidacy should be thrown out because when Murphy presented his signatures he was required to sign an affidavit stating he would "not knowingly violate any election law." It was Otter's contention to Judge Robert Simpson, Jr., that it is unbelievable that Murphy would not know the law, as Murphy is a lawyer.

"Mr. Murphy is a member of the bar of this court. He can't say he doesn't know what the law was. He's been campaigning over a year," Otter said. He then continued, arguing that since Murphy knowingly falsified his name on those two circulation petitions, he also failed to fulfill his candidate affidavit, which according to state law is a criminal offense. 

The campaign manager for the Murphy campaign, Josh Nanberg, said, "Under Otter's argument, any candidate who has a meeting and puts a clipboard at the front table and ... goes to the bathroom should be thrown out. That's ridiculous."

At least 57 people are now known to have died when a boat designed similar to a traditional &lt;a href="w%3ADhow"&gt;dhow&lt;/a&gt; capsized one mile of the coast of &lt;a href="w%3ABahrain"&gt;Bahrain&lt;/a&gt; in the Persian Gulf. Seventeen were Indian and a further 13 of the dead are British; people of another six nationalities are also known to have died. The passengers were mostly foreigners from the Nass-Murray and Roberts construction company, and were enjoying an evening dinner cruise in celebration of their completion of part of the Bahrain World Trade Centre towers. Most who died were dining on the lower deck, and were trapped below.

Over 130 people were onboard the boat at the time, although some say the boat was only licensed to carry 120. Others say the limit was 150. Eyewitnesses say the boat was overloaded. The boat capsized in calm seas soon after it left, trapping many below. Helicopters from the US Navy searched for 13 missing persons until Friday morning, when the search was called off. The dhow had been modified to have an extra, higher deck making the vessel less stable. The exact cause is unknown - suggestions from eyewitnesses include the boat suddenly turning left, being hit by a wave, and many of the passengers moving to one side of the boat together. The Bahrain Interior Ministry is to investigate the accident and establish if the boat was seaworthy.

The world's second largest auto parts maker, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADelphi%20Corporation"&gt;Delphi Corporation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , has announced today that 8,500 salary workers may be out of a job soon as part of a major restructuring plan, which will also include voiding the contract with the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUAW"&gt;UAW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; union. The move would also shutdown over a third of its factories worldwide, including twenty one located in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.

Eight plants in the U.S. are slated to continue operating. Those located in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AClinton%2C%20Mississippi"&gt;Clinton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMississippi"&gt;Mississippi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABrookhaven%2C%20Mississippi"&gt;Brookhaven&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Mississippi, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALockport%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Lockport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARochester%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Rochester&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , New York, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWarren%2C%20Ohio"&gt;Warren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOhio"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVandalia%2C%20Ohio"&gt;Vandalia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Ohio, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKokomo%2C%20Indiana"&gt;Kokomo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIndiana"&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGrand%20Rapids%2C%20Michigan"&gt;Grand Rapids&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMichigan"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; will continue to serve as Delphi properties. The rest of the factories are said to either be sold to other companies, or to be closed entirely. 

The plans were brought up to a bankruptcy judge earlier today. In addition to the proposed closings and layoffs, 34,000 workers may experience cut wages and less benefits. Hourly workers wages will drop from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20dollar"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 27 to $22 an hour soon, and will further decrease to $16.50 in late 2007. 

Delphi previously filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in October 2005. In the original filing, requests were made to drop the hourly wages down to $12.50 an hour.

Joshua Key, a 27-year-old U.S. war deserter, alleged to a Canadian Immigration and Refugee Board yesterday that American soldiers had been kicking the severed head of an Iraqi in Ramadi "like a soccer ball." 

"I couldn't believe someone could do that to a human being," said Key, who is the first U.S. army deserter to make application for refugee status after serving in Iraq. 

The U.S. Army's attitude in Iraq was "just shoot and ask questions later," according to Key. He said, "It's like people could kill if they just wanted to. Everything is justified." 

Key also claimed to have witnessed a "trigger happy" platoon squad sergeant shooting part of an unarmed Iraqi man's foot off after the man had raised his foot as a sign of disrespect.

There are five members of the U.S. armed forces requesting asylum in Canada but Key is the only applicant who has combat experience in Iraq, said Key's lawyer, Jeffry House. "He has boots-on-the-ground experience about what the actual conduct of the war in Iraq is," House said.

Key also said at the hearing; "(Iraqis) are just normal people. They're farmers, mothers, fathers; just like us, just like my home country. I didn't see why we was there." 

Key now works as a welder in British Columbia where he and his wife have four children under six years of age.

There were no representations made at this hearing to dispute the claims made by Key; but Key also did not provide any proof to substantiate his allegations.

On Thursday night, a failure of the Optus B1 satellite affected the Sky Pay TV network and also caused a blackout of other satellite-based systems. Sky TV subscribers will get a refund for the inconvenience.

The satellite was down from Thursday evening to Friday morning. It also covers international emergency service and air traffic coordination. However, thanks to backup services, no serious effects were caused.

Satellite experts and astronomers questioned Sky's explanation that the solar eclipse had hampered attempts to get the service back up and running – the eclipse happened nearly 24 hours before the outage, and thus the satellite should have been in a different area of the sky. A spokesman of Sky TV said the problem occurred because the eclipse happened at the moment the sun was required to charge the satellite's batteries for a routine realignment.

The pay TV company is considering paying compensation to advertising customers as well.

More than 48 million gallons (180 million L) of untreated sewage that flowed into the ocean from a sewer spill on Friday, March 24, have forced city officials in &lt;a href="w%3AHonolulu%2C%20Hawaii"&gt;Honolulu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Hawaii"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, to post signs warning tourists on &lt;a href="w%3AWaikiki"&gt;Waikiki Beach&lt;/a&gt; to stay out of the water.

A 42-inch pressurized sewer line in Waikiki cracked on Friday, March 24, sending untreated sewage into the Ala Wai Canal on the inland (mauka) side of Waikiki. Engineers believe that heavy rains since February 19 overwhelmed the sewer line, which was constructed in 1965.

City officials say that they had no alternative but to pump the raw sewage into the Ala Wai Canal, which empties just west of Waikiki, to prevent the wastewater from backing up into homes and hotels. Repair crews worked around the clock to fix the sewer break. The spill was finally stopped on Thursday.

At first, tides and winds took the sewage spill out to sea, but southerly winds sent the sewage back toward Waikiki Beach, forcing city officials to take action. Signs were posted on beaches on the west side of Waikiki. Bacteria tests taken on the 29th showed levels of bacteria from three to sixty times acceptable levels.

Health officials will continue to test bacteria levels daily, but there is no estimate as to when the contamination will dissipate; warning signs may be in place for as long as several months.

Chemicals, which the Auckland City Council said are a suspected cause of cancer and are considered toxic, have been found in soil at a children's playcentre in &lt;a href="w%3AAuckland"&gt;Auckland&lt;/a&gt;. The contamination was found at the Auckland Central Playcentre in &lt;a href="w%3AFreemans_Bay"&gt;Freemans Bay&lt;/a&gt;, and the Council will now spend $100,000 removing the top 50 &lt;a href="w%3ACentimetre"&gt;cm&lt;/a&gt; (about 20 &lt;a href="w%3AInch"&gt;in&lt;/a&gt;) of soil at the playcentre, doing landscaping and replacing playground equipment.

The presence of "&lt;a href="w%3APolycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbon"&gt;polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="w%3ABenzo%2528a%2529pyrene"&gt;benzo-a-pyrene&lt;/a&gt;," was suspected at the school playground and was confirmed by a chemical analysis on Tuesday. The chemicals may cause temporary digestive and respiratory distress, as well as irritation of the eyes and skin. The levels of benzo-a-pyrene found were between 0.06 and 4.82 milligrams per kilogram of soil at surface level, according to the Ministry of Education. A potential risk is present at levels above 3.5 mg.

<h1>Wikinews interviews Frugalware Linux founder</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Wikinews%20interviews%20Frugalware%20Linux%20founder&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Frugalware Development Team describes ­­&lt;a href="w%3AFrugalware"&gt;Frugalware&lt;/a&gt; as a general purpose &lt;a href="w%3ALinux"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; distribution, designed for intermediate users who are not afraid of &lt;a href="w%3Atext%20mode"&gt;text mode&lt;/a&gt;. Frugalware also plans to offer a &lt;a href="w%3Alive%20CD"&gt;live CD&lt;/a&gt; with desktop options, to be developed by one of its teams. A live CD enables running the Linux software on most compatible Intel and AMD chipset architectures, without having to partition a drive.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A freelance journalist writing for ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ interviewed the founder of &lt;a href="w%3AFrugalware"&gt;Frugalware&lt;/a&gt; Linux, &lt;a href="w%3AMikl%C3%B3s%20Vajna"&gt;Miklós Vajna&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

♡❤♡♡❤Wikinews:♡❤♡♡❤ Frugalware is a slack distribution at present. Are there plans for developing binary package management platforms of it?

♡❤♡♡❤Miklós Vajna:♡❤♡♡❤ Our package manager is called pacman, and its primary purpose is to install binary packages. If you want to install packages from source, you can use our "repoman" tool.

♡❤♡♡❤Wikinews:♡❤♡♡❤ What are your visions for the future of Frugalware, do you plan to globally distribute it as a product, and would you consider allowing a major corporation to sponsor your efforts?

♡❤♡♡❤Miklós Vajna:♡❤♡♡❤ The second. Frugalware is free, but maintaining it needs hardware, mirrors, money. We got several donations already (build servers), and we continuously need them. If a corporation want to sponsor us, I think that is totally O.K. :-)

♡❤♡♡❤Wikinews:♡❤♡♡❤ What is Arch Linux in relationship to your project? And how do their efforts fit into your game plan?

♡❤♡♡❤Miklós Vajna:♡❤♡♡❤ The common [thing] in Arch Linux and Frugalware is the package manager. (To be strict: nothing else.) Developing our package manager is a common effort. If anyone [is] interested in its development, he/she can subscribe to the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.archlinux.org/mailman/listinfo/pacman-dev"&gt;pacman development mailing list&lt;/a&gt;.

♡❤♡♡❤Wikinews:♡❤♡♡❤ I've successfully installed Frugalware, OpenSUSE, and WinXP on the same box. Do you see a lot of people doing this sort of thing in the future?

♡❤♡♡❤Miklós Vajna:♡❤♡♡❤ We support having more than one operating system on a single machine — though this matters only in case Frugalware is the last installed operating system. We do not have any statistics about what operating systems do other people use besides Frugalware, if they have more than one.

♡❤♡♡❤Wikinews:♡❤♡♡❤ Is it possible that PearPC and Frugalware may have a relationship to distribute the PearPC Emulator with Frugalware in the future?

♡❤♡♡❤Miklós Vajna:♡❤♡♡❤ It is already available &lt;a href="http%3A//frugalware.org/packages.php%3Fid%3D4313"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

♡❤♡♡❤Wikinews:♡❤♡♡❤ What kinds of software might you include with further editions of Frugalware? Is Muse part of the base package for electronic musicians, or will you have those sorts of things?

♡❤♡♡❤Miklós Vajna:♡❤♡♡❤ No &lt;a href="http%3A//frugalware.org/packages.php%3Fop%3Dpkg%26amp%3Bsrch%3Dmuse"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It is not available at the moment. You can request a package by filing a feature request to our Bug Tracking System, at &lt;a href="http%3A//bugs.frugalware.org"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

♡❤♡♡❤Wikinews:♡❤♡♡❤ Is the autoupdating feature of Frugalware unique to Frugalware and perhaps a keystone to future developments?

♡❤♡♡❤Miklós Vajna:♡❤♡♡❤ I have never tried other autoupdating features. What one can see is that upgrading even from the previous stable release — which means installing 6 months of update at once — requires only a few tricks, and these are &lt;a href="http%3A//wiki.frugalware.org/Upgrade-0.3-0.4"&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt;. So it works as it should, and we always pay attention not to break this great feature.

♡❤♡♡❤Wikinews:♡❤♡♡❤ What can new users of Frugalware do to test and relay infotmation back to the developers through the correct channels?

♡❤♡♡❤Miklós Vajna:♡❤♡♡❤ We have released stable versions two times a year. There are testing releases every two months. If one would like to help us, then download these releases, test them, and if something is broken, then file a bug report to the BTS (mentioned above already).

&lt;blockquote&gt;Frugalware has new &lt;a href="w%3AX%20Windows"&gt;X Windows&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Avideo%20drivers"&gt;video drivers&lt;/a&gt; that provide a major speed improvement over available patches for previous editions of Linux. Alex Smith has been working on them as a developer.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In addition, the PearPC emulator mentioned above, which comes with the package manager, may, with proper tuning and installation of a ♡❤legal♡❤ copy of Mac OSX, enable many Intel and AMD Frugalware users to use the Apple OS on their desktops. Alex Smith is also a contact person for the PearPC project, which can also be found in irc://irc.freenode.net and at http://www.pearpc.net.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The official release time of the latest edition frugalware-0.4 was Mar 30 07:42:21. The developers can be reached for comment through &lt;a href="w%3AIRC"&gt;IRC&lt;/a&gt; at #frugalware in the irc.freenode.net network.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Simpsons"&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, a major hit animated television show, is set to appear in movie theatres. It has been confirmed that ♡❤The Simpsons Movie♡❤ will appear in theatres July 27, 2007.

♡❤The Simpsons♡❤ has been on television for 17 seasons and &lt;a href="w%3AFOX"&gt;FOX&lt;/a&gt; confirms that it will run at least two more seasons. The show is currently contracted through FOX until 2008 and is the longest running television show on prime-time in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. An estimated over nine million people watch the show every Sunday night, but that number is down from earlier peak viewer numbers.

Moviegoers that go to see ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AIce%20Age%3A%20The%20Meltdown"&gt;Ice Age: The Meltdown&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ will get to see a 25-second 'teaser' trailer of the upcoming movie.

♡❤The Simpsons♡❤ first began on the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Tracey%20Ullman%20Show"&gt;The Tracey Ullman Show&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ in 1987 and in 1989 they started their 30-minute series on FOX.

American multi-billionaire &lt;a href="w%3ADonald%20Trump"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; has announced plans to build a massive &lt;a href="w%3Agolf"&gt;golf&lt;/a&gt; complex on an 800-acre site just north of &lt;a href="w%3AAberdeen"&gt;Aberdeen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AScotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;.

Speaking last night from the &lt;a href="w%3ATrump%20Tower"&gt;Trump Tower&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, Trump said that the development will be akin to a "homecoming" for him. The ginger-haired property tycoon's mother is from the &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20Isles"&gt;Western Isles&lt;/a&gt; of Scotland. 

The £300m project at &lt;a href="w%3AMenie"&gt;Menie&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AAberdeenshire"&gt;Aberdeenshire&lt;/a&gt; will include both a links course and an inland course, and a 400-bedroom hotel as well as a golfing academy and holiday homes. The facilities are being built with the intention of attracting the &lt;a href="w%3AOpen%20Championship"&gt;Open Championship&lt;/a&gt; to the site, officially dubbed ♡❤Trump International Golf Links, Scotland♡❤.

Fields and sand-&lt;a href="w%3Adunes"&gt;dunes&lt;/a&gt; make up the landscape of the coastal site. Trump said of the location, "As soon as I saw it there was no question about it. I looked at 211 fantastic sites all over Europe, but here it is - the dune size and the ocean front. There is no piece of land that I have ever seen that is comparable to this." The billionaire claims that the complex, set to be his only development outside the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, will be the "best course in the world."

Local and national political figures, including Scottish &lt;a href="w%3AFirst%20Minister"&gt;First Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJack%20McConnell"&gt;Jack McConnell&lt;/a&gt;, have welcomed the announcement with open arms, as the project is expected to bring in an additional £157m to the region's economy within the first ten years. Scottish tourism company &lt;a href="w%3AVisitScotland"&gt;VisitScotland&lt;/a&gt; is also optimistic, expecting an influx of international visitors to play on (or simply visit) the site. Plans to expand the A90 road running past the site in the near future will enable more road traffic to and around the area. An £60m expansion of &lt;a href="w%3AAberdeen%20Airport"&gt;Aberdeen Airport&lt;/a&gt; will also allow for vastly increased international air links, akin to those operated using &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20767"&gt;Boeing 767&lt;/a&gt; aircraft.

Work on the golf complex itself is set to begin in September this year, with the Trump Organisation hopeful for a Spring &lt;a href="w%3A2008"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt; opening date.

Following the recent UN Security Council non-binding presidential statement supporting the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20Non-Proliferation%20Treaty"&gt;Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and calling for &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; to temporarily suspend its right under the NPT to enrich and reprocess &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Auranium"&gt;uranium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the chief of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Atomic%20Energy%20Agency"&gt;International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Mohamed%20ElBaradei"&gt;Mohamed ElBaradei&lt;/a&gt;, and diplomats from &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; have expressed their concerns about the threats of economic sanctions or military actions against Iran.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AElBaradei"&gt;ElBaradei&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said that Iran is not "an imminent threat" and urged states to "lower the pitch" in their discussions related to Iran's alleged intentions to develop nuclear weapons.

He opposed both economic sanctions and military actions, saying about the latter, "There is no military solution to this situation. ... It's inconceivable. The only durable solution is a negotiated solution."

The Russian Foreign Minister, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASergey%20Lavrov"&gt;Sergey Lavrov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , said that "Russia doesn't believe that sanctions could achieve the purposes of settlement of various issues." 

He also supported the validity of the IAEA's investigations, saying "Before we call any situation a threat, we need facts, especially in a region like the Middle East, where so many things are happening. ... We prefer very strongly to base our specific actions on specific facts, and in this particular case the facts could be provided by the &lt;nowiki&gt;[International Atomic Energy Agency]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. So far, they have not been provided." 

China's deputy Foreign Minister, Dai Bingguo, said, "The Chinese side feels that there has already been enough turmoil in the Middle East. We do not want to see new turmoil being introduced to the region, because that would not serve the interests of any party and would only be very detrimental to the interests of the people in Middle East." 
A recently leaked letter by British diplomat John Sawers, dated March 16, 2006, revealed intentions by the UK to get the &lt;a href="UN%20Security%20Council"&gt;UN Security Council&lt;/a&gt; to refer to Chapter VII of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Charter"&gt;United Nations Charter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which allows for the use of economic sanctions and/or military force as a method of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aconflict%20resolution"&gt;conflict resolution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , in relation to Iran. The recent UN Security Council non-binding presidential statement referred to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AConfidence%20and%20Security-Building%20Measures"&gt;confidence-building measures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as a method of conflict resolution, but not to economic sanctions nor military force.

<h1>Sun releases T1 source code</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Sun%20releases%20T1%20source%20code&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

On March 21, 2006, &lt;a href="w%3ASun%20Microsystems"&gt;Sun Microsystems&lt;/a&gt; released the source code for its newest processor, the &lt;a href="w%3AUltraSPARC%20T1"&gt;UltraSPARC T1&lt;/a&gt;. The UltraSPARC T1 is available with four, six or eight &lt;a href="w%3AMulticore"&gt;cores&lt;/a&gt;, each able to work on four &lt;a href="w%3AMultithreading"&gt;threads&lt;/a&gt; at a time. The concept is similar to that of the &lt;a href="w%3AIntel"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APentium%20EE"&gt;Pentium EE&lt;/a&gt; which uses two cores with two threads.

A multicore processor is like having many &lt;a href="w%3ACPU"&gt;CPUs&lt;/a&gt; on the one chip. Multiple threads allow each core to work on a number of tasks concurrently on a single core. This is particularly useful in a server environment where the UltraSPAC T1 was designed to be used.

Sun call the open source version of their processor the OpenSPARC T1 and have made the source code (in &lt;a href="w%3AVerilog"&gt;Verilog&lt;/a&gt; format) and specifications available on the OpenSPARC T1 website under the &lt;a href="w%3AGeneral%20Public%20License"&gt;General Public License&lt;/a&gt;, the same license under which most distributions of &lt;a href="w%3ALinux"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; are released.

Industry observers say that the move is triggered by the &lt;a href="w%3ASPARC"&gt;SPARC&lt;/a&gt; architecture's shrinking market share to the likes of &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Business%20Machines"&gt;IBM's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AIBM_POWER"&gt;POWER&lt;/a&gt; architecture and &lt;a href="w%3AX86%20architecture"&gt;x86&lt;/a&gt; based chips from Intel and &lt;a href="w%3AAdvanced%20Micro%20Devices"&gt;AMD&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AOpen%20source%20hardware"&gt;Open Source Hardware&lt;/a&gt; has been gaining momentum since 2002, when &lt;a href="w%3AKofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt; issued a challenge to technology companies. Despite Sun's OpenSPARC T1 not being the first open source processor in the world, it is the first time that the design for a proprietary design processor has been released to the open source community.

Torrential rains pounded &lt;a href="w%3AHonolulu"&gt;Honolulu&lt;/a&gt; and the eastern part of the island of Oahu on Friday during the midday, causing flooding along streams and major highways and closing a major shopping mall.

Between 10:30 a.m. and 1 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3AHawaii-Aleutian_Standard_Time_Zone"&gt;HST&lt;/a&gt; (2030 to 2300 &lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated_Universal_Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;), rain fell at the rate of about one to two inches (2.5 to 5.0 cm) an hour in Honolulu and up to three inches (7.5 cm) an hour in Waimanalo on the southeast coast.

Makiki Stream overflowed its banks at several points along its route, especially in the Pawaa district where homes and businesses near Kalakaua Avenue were inundated by up to a foot of water. Several houses in Manoa were also reported flooded as Manoa Stream overtopped its banks.

Kahala Mall, a major shopping mall in the upscale district of Kahala, was closed due to flooding that left 80% of the stores under as much as a foot and a half of water. According to eyewitness reports, the flooding started when rushing water breached a wall in the mall's movie theatres. The mall remains closed today and tomorrow while officials assess damage and clean up.

The rainstorm capped one and a half months of heavy rain and thunderstorms in the state of Hawaii, and arguably its rainiest March in recent memory.
