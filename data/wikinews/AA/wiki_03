&lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;ese &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Japan"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJunichiro%20Koizumi"&gt;Junichiro Koizumi&lt;/a&gt; announced on Friday that Japan will not shoot down missiles that are headed for its allies.

Koizumi spoke at the plenary meeting of the &lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20of%20Councillors"&gt;Upper House&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3ADiet%20of%20Japan"&gt;Japanese Parliament&lt;/a&gt;.

"The purpose of our country's missile defense is to intercept incoming missiles targeting Japan," said Koizumi. "We are not thinking of dealing with other missiles targeting our allies."

Koizumi pointed out that the angle and altitude of a missile in flight could be used to determine the target of the missile. He went on to clarify that he believed Japan could provide data about missiles to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; without violating &lt;a href="w%3AConstitution%20of%20Japan"&gt;Japan's constitution&lt;/a&gt;.

Japan plans to install several American-made &lt;a href="w%3AMIM-104%20Patriot"&gt;Patriot "Pak-3"&lt;/a&gt; complexes for its land-based defense systems, and later plans to install the American-made &lt;a href="w%3AAegis%20combat%20system"&gt;Aegis combat system&lt;/a&gt; on its &lt;a href="w%3ANaval%20ship"&gt;naval ships&lt;/a&gt;.

Forty-two miners are confirmed dead and 27 are missing, after an explosion at the Xishui Mine in &lt;a href="w%3AShuozhou"&gt;Shuozhou&lt;/a&gt;, a city in &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AShanxi"&gt;Shanxi province&lt;/a&gt;.

Six rescue teams are working at the site to rescue the missing personnel, according to Liu Jiwen, an onsite rescue consultant. Two miners were rescued earlier in the day.

Xishui Mine is licensed to produce 150,000 tons of &lt;a href="w%3ACoal"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt; per year. But the mine was ordered closed in 2004 for safety violations.

"In defiance of the order, however, mine owners have restarted production this year," stated a province-level official.

Police have arrested the owners of the Xishui mine.

Zhang Baoshun, the governor of Shanxi province, is on the scene to oversee the rescue work and an investigation of the accident.

Twenty-two other miners were working at the nearby Kangjiayao mine at the time of the accident, although it is unclear if any of those miners were affected.

Thousands of miners die in &lt;a href="w%3AMining"&gt;mining&lt;/a&gt; accidents each year in China. Today's accident comes just one day after 19 coal miners were killed in a mining accident in the Sulongsi mine in &lt;a href="w%3AChongqing"&gt;Chongqing&lt;/a&gt;, and one month after the largest accident in recent history killed 214 miners, in &lt;a href="w%3AFuxin"&gt;Fuxin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALiaoning%20Province"&gt;Liaoning Province&lt;/a&gt;.

KYUSHU, Japan – A powerful magnitude 7 &lt;a href="w%3Aearthquake"&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt; rocked &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan's&lt;/a&gt; southwestern island of &lt;a href="w%3AKyushu"&gt;Kyushu&lt;/a&gt; at 10:53 am local time today (0153 UTC), prompting the &lt;a href="w%3AJMA"&gt;Japanese Meteorological Agency&lt;/a&gt; to issue &lt;a href="w%3Atsunami"&gt;tsunami&lt;/a&gt; warnings for the area. The tsunami warnings were canceled later in the day.

A 75-year-old woman was killed in &lt;a href="w%3AFukuoka%2C%20Fukuoka"&gt;Fukuoka city&lt;/a&gt; by a falling wall. At least 400 people were injured by the quake. Local &lt;a href="w%3AFukuoka%20Airport"&gt;Fukuoka Airport&lt;/a&gt; and high speed bullet trains in the area temporarily suspended operations to look for damage.

According to the agency, the &lt;a href="w%3Aepicenter"&gt;epicenter&lt;/a&gt; of the earthquake was in shallow water in the &lt;a href="w%3ASea%20of%20Japan"&gt;Sea of Japan&lt;/a&gt;, off the north coast of &lt;a href="w%3AFukuoka%20Prefecture"&gt;Fukuoka Prefecture&lt;/a&gt;.

Small aftershocks continued throughout the day, with authorities advising that residents should be prepared for aftershocks of up to magnitude 6.

In the aftermath of the quake, people were quickly alerted to the state of the situation by television reports, telephone, and text-messaging systems.
Interviewed by telephone in &lt;a href="w%3AHitoyoshi"&gt;Hitoyoshi&lt;/a&gt;, well inland from the epicenter of the quake, a local resident noted the severity of the quake was frightening, and left the elderly woman unable to remain seated on a chair. Shutting off gas was the first priority, with the local television coverage providing a quick status update for the situation, followed by an interruption by national emergency network coverage.

A foreign resident of &lt;a href="w%3AFukuoka%20City"&gt;Fukuoka city&lt;/a&gt; reported taking refuge under his desk for several minutes as books and ornaments fell from shelves. He prepared to evacuate to high ground in case of a tsunami, but news reports indicated little danger from a tsunami. He also reported that Japanese residents appeared unconcerned by the quake, with many strolling near Momochi beach shortly after the quake, showing little apparent concern.
In Tenjin, downtown Fukuoka, Fukuoka Building's windows shattered, and the block was quickly cordoned off. In addition to Fukuoka Building, many other buildings and businesses remained closed to shoppers.

Wikinews contributor Oarih reports that a festive atmosphere pervaded the streets, however, as employees from Nishinihon Shimbun (a major Japanese newspaper) passed out one-page articles on the earthquake and curious onlookers investigated the damaged buildings and sidewalks. Many residents, relieved by the relatively low damage inflicted by the earthquake, started visiting pubs and restaurants at lunch for a celebratory beer. With train and subway services disrupted, queues over 100 people long formed at some Nishitetsu bus stops in Tenjin as dusk approached.

The penetration of modern &lt;a href="w%3Atext%20messaging"&gt;text-messaging&lt;/a&gt; by the Japanese Keitai, the common Japanese cell phone system more prevalent than computer-based email, led to quick status checks on many family members located near the coast around Fukuoka, close to the quake's epicentre. Wikinews contributor Oarih reports that cell phone service providers were swamped by the spike in use, however, and both voice and text services remained unreliable for much of the day.

Thirty-five worshippers are confirmed dead and many are injured after an explosion near a mosque in Fatahpur, &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;, at 10:30 pm local time (1730 UTC).

"I can confirm that 35 bodies have been counted," administrator Mahmood Mari told &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAgence%20France-Presse"&gt;AFP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

"It was a powerful bomb. There was blood and body parts everywhere," police official Mehrab Khan, told &lt;a href="Associated%20Press"&gt;AP&lt;/a&gt;.

"Right now people are angry. They are wailing and crying. Some of them have blocked roads in the town and we are trying to control the situation," Khan said.

The remote town of Fatahpur is located about 300km (180 miles) from &lt;a href="Quetta"&gt;Quetta&lt;/a&gt;.

No one has has claimed responsibility for the attack, according to local officials.

The blast caused the largest death toll this year in an area affected by religious conflict and tribal uprisings. Officials have not determined a cause for the blast.

Eleven residents of an apartment building in the Christian neighborhood of New Jdeideh, located in northern &lt;a href="w%3ABeirut"&gt;Beirut&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;, were injured by an explosion just after midnight local time.

The explosion was caused by a bomb placed underneath a car that was parked near the eight-story building inhabited by the injured, and left a seven-foot-deep hole in the ground. The building was ruined by the blast.

The Lebanese army responded with a tighter security policy.

"The army will not allow that freedom of expression be abused in order to harm security and stability," declared the military statement.

Lebanese President &lt;a href="w%3A%C3%89mile%20Lahoud"&gt;Émile Lahoud&lt;/a&gt; decided not to attend the upcoming Arab summit, and appealed for talks to avoid religious violence.

"Car bomb messages do not threaten our national unity," said opposition leader Walid Jumblatt, speaking from his mountain palace in Mukhtara.

At least fourteen people were injured today by an explosion at the remote Electric Mountain Lodge, in Paonia, &lt;a href="Colorado"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt;.

The blast was reported at 2:30pm local time (9:30 UTC).

A county investigator suspects that the explosion was caused by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Apropane%20gas"&gt;propane gas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

"We're starting to get patients now, but I can't tell you how many we're expecting – a bunch," hospital administrator Tom Mingen told Denver's CBS4 news from Delta County Memorial Hospital. He continued, "Electric Mountain Lodge is probably in the most remote part of our county. About 20 miles north of Paonia and 17 miles in by snowmobile."

The lodge, located in the Gunnison National Forest area at an elevation of 9,200 feet, is only accessible by helicopter or snowmobile during the winter season.

One Briton is dead, and dozens of others are injured, after an explosion ripped through a theatre in the Fareek Klaib district of &lt;a href="w%3ADoha"&gt;Doha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AQatar"&gt;Qatar&lt;/a&gt; this morning.

"One building at the theatre collapsed. There was pandemonium in the area. It took firefighters some time to put out the fire," said British diplomat Eric Mattey.

"One person was killed and 12 were wounded, of whom 10 have left hospital," said a statement issued by the Interior Ministry.

According to witnesses, about 80 foreigners were in the audience, watching the second act of Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night", at the time of the explosion.

Although the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Central%20Command"&gt;US Central Command&lt;/a&gt; is located in the Arab Gulf country, the bombing was the first of its kind in Qatar. The theatre is located in the same area where the US embassy was previously located before it was moved to a new location.

Four policemen are dead and eight people are injured, after a roadside explosion in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKirkuk"&gt;Kirkuk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; earlier today, according to Lieutenant Colonel Yadkar Muhammad.

The officers had just attended a funeral for a fellow officer, who had been killed on Friday by gunmen after another roadside explosion.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; military had no information about today's explosion.

Hundreds of policemen have been killed since the start of the US-led &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Awar%20in%20Iraq"&gt;war in Iraq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The &lt;a href="US"&gt;America&lt;/a&gt;n state of &lt;a href="Georgia%20%28US%20state%29"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt; faces a new problem as wildlife officials discovered the &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20America"&gt;South America&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href="w%3AApple%20snail"&gt;channeled apple snail&lt;/a&gt; along the &lt;a href="w%3AAlabaha%20river"&gt;Alabaha River&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3APierce%20County"&gt;Pierce County&lt;/a&gt; last month. Similar snails have been seen in four American states, including at least nine &lt;a href="w%3AFlorida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; counties, and &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;.

Apple snails (those of the ♡❤ampullariidae♡❤ family) are tropical and sub-tropical freshwater snails. They are named for their round shell, which is apple shaped. The channeled apple snail (♡❤Pomacea canaliculata♡❤) has a yellow-to-brown shell that may grow to the size of a baseball. Unlike many other freshwater gastropods, Apple Snails have both a lung and a gill. This allows them to live even in oxygen-poor waters. Outside of their natural &lt;a href="w%3Ahabitat"&gt;habitat&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20America"&gt;South America,&lt;/a&gt; the snails have no natural enemies. As they reproduce quickly and feed on aquatic plants, which provide food and shelter for native species, they can be devastating to their new environment.

"This discovery is one of particular interest because of the invasive nature of the species," assistant chief of DNR's Non-game Wildlife and Natural Heritage Section Jon Ambrose told the &lt;a href="w%3AAP"&gt;AP&lt;/a&gt;. "Because of the array of problems that can arise from releasing non-native species into Georgia's waters, we want to stress that this is not a responsible practice for pet owners."

DNR biologists searched the site of the discovery again last weekend. Although no more channeled apple snails were found, they may return for a more elaborate search. The Georgia winter, more severe than Florida´s, may put a stop to the threat.

The British man who died in an expolsion in a theatre in the Qateri capital has been named by the British &lt;a href="w%3AForeign%20and%20Commonwealth%20Office"&gt;Foreign and Commonwealth Office&lt;/a&gt; as Jonathan Adams. His family has been informed but asked for no further details to be released.

The Qateri authories believe the suicide bomber was an Egyptian living in Qater.

The issue of whose news content belongs to whom could get serious judicial review in a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 17.5 million &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="wikt%3Alawsuit"&gt;lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; brought against the search engine giant &lt;a href="Google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;. The French news agency &lt;a href="Agence%20France%20Presse"&gt;Agence France Presse&lt;/a&gt; (AFP) is suing Google News for including their headlines, story leads and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThumbnail"&gt;thumbnail graphics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on the site's news summary pages. AFP alleges they asked Google to refrain from the practice, but the site has not complied.

The basis for the suit is that AFP sells its content via a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="wikt%3Asubscription"&gt;subscription&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . They allege Google News copies their content and provides it free in the form of a short summary. The suit was filed at the &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; District court for the &lt;a href="District%20of%20Columbia"&gt;District of Columbia&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday.

Google has not responded to the lawsuit yet.

A federal appeals court ruling in 2002 allows web sites to use thumbnails and 30 to 40 words of text if the content is linked to the source. EARTHtimes.org writes of Google's practice, "(it) does seem to follow the Federal ruling guidelines."

The &lt;a href="w%3ALebanon"&gt;Lebanese&lt;/a&gt; political opposition group, dubbed the &lt;a href="w%3ACedar%20Revolution"&gt;"Cedar Revolution"&lt;/a&gt; by the US State Department, claims &lt;a href="w%3ASyria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt; should be held responsible for a &lt;a href="w%3Acar%20bomb"&gt;car bomb&lt;/a&gt; that rocked the Christian neighborhood of New Jdeideh in the capital city of &lt;a href="w%3ABeirut"&gt;Beirut&lt;/a&gt;, The blast occurred early yesterday morning.

"The security agencies belong to [Syria]. There is no other explanation. When security agencies come under Lebanese control it will be another matter," Reuters quotes opposition leader and &lt;a href="w%3ADruze"&gt;Druze&lt;/a&gt; chieftain &lt;a href="w%3AWalid%20Jumblatt"&gt;Walid Jumblatt&lt;/a&gt; as saying.

After the car bomb explosion, which injured eleven people, a series of fake bombs were discovered throughout the neighborhood. There were also and several sonic grenades thrown at pro-Syrian Lebanese Democratic Party offices.

"We warn Syria not to let these midgets carry out security actions in the country," Reuters quotes Jumblatt as adding.

"This has been the message to the Lebanese people...to sow fear and terror among Lebanese citizens if there is a Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon," said Pierre Gemayel, a Christian opposition member who visited the site of the blast.

<h1>Driftwood crucifix listed on eBay for $25,000</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Driftwood%20crucifix%20listed%20on%20eBay%20for%20%2425%2C000&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
A piece of driftwood in the shape of a crucifix is listed for sale on eBay with a starting bid price of $25,000. The seller, known as "Marzipanda," from &lt;a href="w%3AScottsdale%2C%20Arizona"&gt;Scottsdale, Arizona&lt;/a&gt; lists its description as a "Natural Found Wood Jesus Christ Crucifix Cross Easter."

Maripanda describes the discovery of the piece as, "My very dear friend found this amazing natural driftwood while hiking a few years ago. So striking because it clearly resembles the Lord and all the details."

Expensive &lt;a href="w%3Afound%20art"&gt;found art&lt;/a&gt; Christiana made international headlines in November 2004 when a Florida woman named Diana Duyser sold a partially eaten grilled cheese sandwich on eBay for $28,000 to Canadian online gambling website, GoldenPalace.com, after claiming she saw the likeness of the &lt;a href="w%3AVirgin%20Mary"&gt;Virgin Mary&lt;/a&gt; burned onto the toast.

But not all high-priced Christian fare on eBay is of dubious value. A perusal of Christian-themed items as of March 20, showed 13,944 for sale on eBay. They ranged from other found art to some very expensive and authenticated rare art.

One such item has an eBay seller from &lt;a href="w%3ATel-Aviv"&gt;Tel-Aviv&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; listing a 19th century iron wall plaque with a starting bid of $30,000 and a shipping cost of $2,000, making it the most-expensive Christian religious item listed for sale on the auction web site.

Under the "Christian Icons" section of the site, the 14 cast iron plaques are advertised to have been made in 1855 and portrays "Jesus in Jerusalem" with the 14 stations of Christ.

Another high-priced Christian-themed item is a set of chalices and paten in &lt;a href="w%3AFt.%20Lauderdale"&gt;Ft. Lauderdale, Florida&lt;/a&gt; for $3,550. The gold-plated silver is thought to have been made in the &lt;a href="w%3A1870s"&gt;1870s&lt;/a&gt;.

Tens of thousands of anti-war &lt;a href="protests"&gt;protesters&lt;/a&gt; marched though &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday to mark the two year anniversary of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2003%20Invasion%20of%20Iraq"&gt;invasion of Iraq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Organisers estimated the number of marchers at over 150,000, however the police put the number at 45,000.

The march started at Hyde park and moved past the American embassy, ending in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATrafalgar%20square"&gt;Trafalgar square&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The protest was one of a number of demonstrations around the world. Protests took place in &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.

The protests had been called by the Anti-war Assembly of the 2005 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Social%20Forum"&gt;World Social Forum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , an annual conference of the alternative globalization movement which took place in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APorto%20Alegre%2C%20Brazil"&gt;Porto Alegre&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Brazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; in January 26&amp;ndash;31, and were supported by coalitions from all over the world. The London protest was organised by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStop%20the%20War%20Coalition"&gt;Stop the War Coalition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

At least 10,000 protesters stormed government buildings, burnt down a police station, and took control of an airport to prevent reinforcements from being flown into Jalal-Abad, &lt;a href="w%3AKyrgyzstan"&gt;Kyrgyzstan&lt;/a&gt; today as they demanded the resignation of president &lt;a href="w%3AAskar%20Akayev"&gt;Askar Akayev&lt;/a&gt;. The protesters claim that recent parliamentary elections were rigged.

According to a police source in the capital of &lt;a href="w%3ABishkek"&gt;Bishkek&lt;/a&gt;, four police were beaten to death in clashes with protesters.

Last week, Akayev warned civil war would break out if there was an attempt to copy the &lt;a href="w%3AUkraine"&gt;Ukrainian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AOrange%20Revolution"&gt;"Orange Revolution."&lt;/a&gt; However, the government says it wants a peaceful resolution. "We have never gone against our own people, especially not with weapons in our hands," Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ANikolai%20Tanayev"&gt;Nikolai Tanayev&lt;/a&gt; said.

Opposition leader Kurmanbek Bakiyev says negotiations will only be fruitful if president Akayev himself is involved. "All other lower level negotiations will be just a waste of time," Bakiyev said.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20State"&gt;U.S. state department&lt;/a&gt; issued a statement saying the situation could be dealt with "according to the &lt;a href="w%3ARule%20of%20law"&gt;rule of law&lt;/a&gt;," and spokesman Adam Ereli said, "U.S. officials have been in contact with both the government and opposition to reinforce this message."

The &lt;a href="w%3AOSCE"&gt;OSCE&lt;/a&gt; stated the elections did not properly measure up to international standards, citing "lack of effective voter access to diverse sources of information, bias in the media, continued de-registration of candidates on minor grounds..., and inaccurate and poorly maintained voter lists."

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACambridge%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Cambridge, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
Gas With a Smile, an independent gas station on &lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts%20Avenue"&gt;Massachusetts Avenue&lt;/a&gt; in Cambridge has filed with the city for a hearing with the license commission to amend its license to do business as Hess Express. According to the Cambridge Department of Human Services, the Christos Poutahides No. 6 Family Limited Partnership, which owns the station, has asked that they be allowed not to offer repair services at the site. A hearing will be held on March 29, 2005, at the Lombardi Municipal Building at 831 Massachusetts Avenue in Cambridge.

According to a guide published by the city, a "Garage and Gasoline License" is required "for a commercial or residential parking garage with space for 3 vehicles or more to keep and store flammables."

Gas With a Smile was shut down by the city fire department in 1999 for failing to upgrade its underground gas tanks to comply with federal regulations passed 10 years earlier.

Hess Express gas stations are owned by Amerada Hess, which operates approximately 1250 gas stations on the eastern seaboard of the United States.

<h1>Bush signs historic Schiavo bill into law</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Bush%20signs%20historic%20Schiavo%20bill%20into%20law&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; approved a historic bill designed to keep brain-damaged &lt;a href="Terri%20Schiavo"&gt;Terri Schiavo&lt;/a&gt; on life-support, shortly after it was sent to him by the &lt;a href="US%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;US House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;.

"Today, I signed into law a bill that will allow federal courts to hear a claim by or on behalf of Terri Schiavo for violation of her rights relating to the withholding or withdrawal of food, fluids, or medical treatment necessary to sustain her life," said Bush's written statement.

Bush waited at the &lt;a href="US%20White%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; for the bill's arrival and signed it into law after returning early from a vacation at his Texas ranch.

The House passed the bill by a vote of 203&amp;ndash;58 shortly after midnight in a rare Sunday session called at 9pm that night. Democrats objected to a call for unanimous consent earlier in the day. Although most members had left for the Easter break, 261 of the 435 House members returned for the vote.

Representatives debated the measure in the House from both sides.

Rep. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Sensenbrenner"&gt;James Sensenbrenner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a &lt;a href="Wisconsin"&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Republican%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt;, said of previous rulings in &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; that they were "enforcing a merciless directive to deprive Terri Schiavo of her right to life." He continued that the House should "reinforce the law's commitment to justice and compassion for all Americans, particularly the most vulnerable."

&lt;a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;Democrat&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Wexler"&gt;Robert Wexler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of Florida disagreed, saying "Tonight this Congress is about to commit a travesty. Tonight congressional leaders are poised to appoint this Congress as a judge and a jury."

The &lt;a href="United%20States%20Senate"&gt;US Senate&lt;/a&gt; had passed the bill by unanimous consent earlier in the day.

Terri Schiavo has been on life-support for over 15 years, and is currently cared for at a Florida hospice. She is considered by physicians to be in a "permanent vegetative state", while her parents contend that she is viable and that there is hope for recovery. Schiavo's feeding tube was removed on Friday after Florida courts ruled in favor of her husband, Michael Schiavo, who acts as her legal guardian in the matter. Terri Schiavo's siblings, and her parents, Bob and Mary Schindler, challenge this decision.

"We are very very thankful to have crossed this bridge," said Suzanne Vitadamo, Terri Schiavo's sister. "We are hopeful, we are very hopeful, that the federal courts will follow the will of Congress and save my sister's life."

The corporate boards from both companies were in talks all weekend negotiating what appears to be an all-stock deal. If approved, the price tag would be a substantial premium over ♡❤Ask Jeeves♡❤ valuation of $1.4 billion as of Friday's stock market close.

The acquisition of &lt;a href="w%3AOakland%2C%20California"&gt;Oakland, California-based&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤Ask Jeeves♡❤ by IAC would mean they own a known brand name and get a foothold in revenues from search engine advertising.

Automobile industry pioneer, &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20DeLorean"&gt;John DeLorean&lt;/a&gt;, died Saturday in a New Jersey hospital by complications from a stroke.

DeLorean was born in 1925 in &lt;a href="w%3ADetroit%2C%20Michigan"&gt;Detroit, Michigan&lt;/a&gt; to European immigrant parents. He received an education in automotive engineering and quickly rose through the ranks of &lt;a href="w%3APackard"&gt;Packard&lt;/a&gt; and later &lt;a href="w%3AGeneral%20Motors"&gt;General Motors&lt;/a&gt; (GM). DeLorean was credited with the development of the &lt;a href="w%3APontiac%20GTO"&gt;Pontiac GTO&lt;/a&gt;, which helped introduce the era of "muscle cars". By 1965, DeLorean led the entire Pontiac division, and four years later was promoted to the prestigious position of leading GM's &lt;a href="w%3AChevrolet"&gt;Chevrolet&lt;/a&gt;.

In 1973, DeLorean quit General Motors and started his own company, the &lt;a href="w%3ADe%20Lorean%20Motor%20Company"&gt;De Lorean Motor Company&lt;/a&gt;. The company's product was the &lt;a href="w%3ADe%20Lorean%20DMC-12"&gt;DMC-12&lt;/a&gt;, an unusual car featuring an unpainted, stainless-steel exterior and gull-wing doors. The company started production in 1981 but failed less than two years later, having produced under 9,000 vehicles. Despite the company's failure and the car's dismal sales, the car itself gained a cult following after the release of the 1985 movie &lt;a href="w%3ABack%20to%20the%20Future"&gt;Back to the Future&lt;/a&gt; which featured the car as a time-travel machine.

DeLorean himself was in nearly as much trouble as his company. In 1982 he was arrested for attempting to sell $24 million worth of &lt;a href="w%3Acocaine"&gt;cocaine&lt;/a&gt; to undercover police, and after his company's failure, he became involved in a multitude of lawsuits alleging investor fraud. Though DeLorean successfully resolved the cocaine case after claiming &lt;a href="w%3Aentrapment"&gt;entrapment&lt;/a&gt;, his other legal cases would drag on until 1999, when he declared &lt;a href="w%3Abankruptcy"&gt;bankruptcy&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="UN"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; Secretary General &lt;a href="Kofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt; will formally present a plan this morning to the &lt;a href="United%20Nations%20General%20Assembly"&gt;UN General Assembly&lt;/a&gt; when it meets in &lt;a href="New%20York%20State"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; later today. The plan, entitled &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIn%20Larger%20Freedom"&gt;In Larger Freedom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , is part of the UN's attempt to revitalise itself during its sixtieth anniversary year.

If implemented, this plan will be the largest change ever to the international body, calling for the addition of nine members to the &lt;a href="UN%20Security%20Council"&gt;Security Council&lt;/a&gt;, and for the creation of a new Human Rights Council to replace the 53-member &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Commission%20on%20Human%20Rights"&gt;Human Rights Commission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

&lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Gates"&gt;Bill Gates's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; could be fined as much as 5.0% of its daily income, roughly US$ 5 million per day according to &lt;a href="w%3AWall%20Street%20Journal"&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt; calculatations, if it does not comply with demands set by the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Commission"&gt;European Commission&lt;/a&gt;. The commission investigated Microsoft's practice of bundling the Windows Media Player software into the &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20Windows"&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt; operating system in &lt;a href="w%3A2003"&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3A2004"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;, a practice which rivals complained was destroying the market for their own products. The ♡❤Wall Street Journal♡❤ reported Monday a week ago that the European Commission would decide their course of action in two weeks time.

Negotiations between Microsoft and the Commission broke down in March 2004 and the company was subsequently fined a record &lt;a href="w%3AEuro"&gt;€&lt;/a&gt;497 million (US$ 613 million) for its breaches of &lt;a href="w%3AEU%20competition%20law"&gt;EU competition law&lt;/a&gt;.

The ruling is subject to appeal, but a European Court decided in Dec 2004 that fines imposed on Microsoft by the EU would not be delayed. Microsoft paid the €497 million fine and must now ship versions of Windows without Windows Media Player. It was also decided by the EU court that Microsoft must license many of the protocols used in its products to developers in countries within the European Economic Area.

The European Commission rejected today a proposal by Microsoft to license its workgroup server software protocols. These protocols would allow programmers to build server programs that are compatible with systems and &lt;a href="w%3APC"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt;s running the Windows operating system. Influencing the decision were complaints from the Free Software Foundation Europe (&lt;a href="w%3AFSF%20Europe"&gt;FSF Europe&lt;/a&gt;), which said the per-server licensing proposal violated the principle that the protocols could be used to develop free software, because there is no way of knowing how many servers will be using free software.

"Microsoft either doesn't understand or doesn't want to understand the idea of free software," said FSF Europe spokesman Joachim Jakobs. 

Jakobs explained that as free software is freely distributed, it is impossible to predict the extent of its use. Also, authors of free software would encounter copyright issues with Microsoft when using the protocols to distribute their software. Microsoft stated last Friday that it is still trying to find the balance between the need to preserve the private interests of Microsoft and the public interests.

Earlier, the European Commission rejected Microsoft's proposal to release the new Windows Media Player-free version of Windows under the name "Reduced Media Edition." Microsoft is now investigating other names suggested by the Commission. It is still unclear whether a deadline is or will be set for the demands by the EU.

Portal and search company &lt;a href="Yahoo"&gt;Yahoo!&lt;/a&gt; has purchased Ludicorp Research and Development Ltd., the private corporation which owns the photo sharing site &lt;a href="w%3AFlickr"&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt;.
The news was officially disclosed in a Sunday posting to the corporation's staff blog and is credited to Caterina Fake, Flickr's vice president of marketing and community. The posting announced the sale, but did not disclose details of the deal. In a report by Silicon.Com, Yahoo! spokeswoman Joanna Stevens confirmed the deal on Sunday but also did not disclose the terms. 

Both Fake and Stevens said Flickr will remain independent. Stevens added that Flickr's employees will relocate to the Yahoo! headquarters in Sunnyvale, California later this year.

Rumors of the sale have been circulating amongst bloggers for some time, though neither company would confirm or deny the rumored sale. Other rumors had Google or AOL as Flickr's probable suitor.

Flickr allows users to upload pictures from their computers, digital cameras, or camera phones to a personal website where they can display them, engage in photo &lt;a href="w%3Ablog"&gt;blogging&lt;/a&gt; and create photo albums. The graphics may be licensed under a variety copyright license schemes including public domain, and photo owners can be easily contacted through the website.

Yahoo! had earlier announced &lt;a href="http%3A//p6.mgl.re2.yahoo.com/index_beta.html"&gt;Yahoo! 360°&lt;/a&gt;, a blogging service with sharing privileges and integration with other Yahoo! services such as internet broadcasting and instant messaging.

US &lt;a href="w%3AParticle%20physics"&gt;particle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APhysicist"&gt;physicists&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3ABrookhaven%20National%20Laboratory"&gt;Brookhaven National Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AUpton%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Upton, New York&lt;/a&gt; have created a fireball in a &lt;a href="w%3AParticle%20accelerator"&gt;particle accelerator&lt;/a&gt; that bears a striking similarity to a &lt;a href="w%3ABlack%20hole"&gt;black hole&lt;/a&gt;. It was generated at the &lt;a href="w%3ARelativistic%20Heavy%20Ion%20Collider"&gt;Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)&lt;/a&gt; by smashing beams of gold nuclei together at almost the speed of light. 

The collision produces a ball of plasma which is about 300 million times hotter that the surface of the &lt;a href="w%3ASun"&gt;Sun&lt;/a&gt;. The fireball can be detected because it absorbs jets of particles produced by the collision, but in this case 10 times as many jets were being absorbed as had been predicted by calculations. 

Physicist Horatiu Nastase of &lt;a href="w%3ABrown%20University"&gt;Brown University&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AProvidence%2C%20Rhode%20Island"&gt;Providence, Rhode Island&lt;/a&gt; says that the calculations show that the fireball has properties similar to that of a black hole. Nastase says this could help explain why so few jets are seen coming out of the fireball. He thinks the particles are being absorbed into the core and reappearing as &lt;a href="w%3AHawking%20radiation"&gt;thermal (Hawking) radiation&lt;/a&gt;, just like theory predicts happens in a black hole. 

Other physicists have pointed out possible holes in Nastase’s calculations. Carlos Nunez of &lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology"&gt;MIT&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ACambridge%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Cambridge, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; said, “I wouldn’t say his model is wrong, but it’s clearly under construction.”

Even if Nastase turns out to be right, the black holes created pose no danger. At this scale gravity is not the dominant force in a black hole and they quickly evaporate away - this one lasted a mere 10 seconds, that is 10 million, billion, billionths of a second.

A &lt;a href="w%3AHouston"&gt;Houston&lt;/a&gt; jury resumes deliberations today in a federal &lt;a href="w%3ASmuggle"&gt;smuggling&lt;/a&gt; case where 19 &lt;a href="w%3Aillegal"&gt;illegal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AImigrants"&gt;immigrants&lt;/a&gt; died from heat and lack of oxygen. The defendant, Tyrone Williams, 34, could face the death penalty for his alleged involvement in harboring and transporting illegal immigrants across the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;US-&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMexico"&gt;Mexican&lt;/a&gt; border.

He was reportedly paid $7,500 to bring the immigrants to Houston in a &lt;a href="w%3ATractor%20trailer"&gt;tractor trailer truck&lt;/a&gt;.

Williams, a &lt;a href="w%3AJamaca"&gt;Jamaican&lt;/a&gt; citizen, was a member of a &lt;a href="w%3ACrime%20ring"&gt;smuggling ring.&lt;/a&gt; He alone faces &lt;a href="w%3ACapital%20punishment"&gt;capital punishment charges&lt;/a&gt;, while 14 other ring members were charged with less serious offenses for their involvement in the case. Williams allegedly made a four-hour trip across the border and then parked at a truck stop in &lt;a href="w%3AVictoria%2C%20Texas"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt;, about 100 miles from Houston. He left the truck while 75 persons suffered in the cargo area of the trailer during sweltering heat.

The prosecution claims he abandoned the trailer while ignoring screams for help and banging on the walls from those inside the trailer.

His defense attorneys argue Williams was unable to hear anything from the trailer, and they further say greed by other ring members was the cause of the deaths since the trailer was so overcrowded. Williams should not be singled out, his attorneys maintained, just because he was the driver of the truck.

"He didn't care," said federal prosecutor Daniel Rodriguez during closing arguments. "To him, these weren't people, they were merchandise."

The jury asked U.S. District Judge Vanessa Gilmore three questions before the trial was adjourned for the weekend.

It emerged last night that the &lt;a href="w%3ABank%20of%20Ireland"&gt;Bank of Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIreland"&gt;Ireland's&lt;/a&gt; second largest bank, intends to lay off 15% of its workforce. Such a move would affect 2,000 of the bank's 12,000 employees. The job cuts would be an effort to reduce the banks large cost base and thus improve its overall &lt;a href="w%3Acompetitiveness"&gt;competitiveness&lt;/a&gt;.

Newly appointed &lt;a href="w%3ACEO"&gt;CEO&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABrian%20Goggin"&gt;Brian Goggin&lt;/a&gt;, who took over from &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Soden"&gt;Michael Soden&lt;/a&gt; at the end of last year, suggested at the time of his appointment that one of his first moves would be to cut costs. This objective is likely to be fulfilled on Tuesday when the company makes a formal announcement about the cuts. The relative contributions of staff versus technology to the Bank's cost versus revenue base is unclear from the announcement, begging questions as to the rationale for such changes. 

The Irish banking sector - one of the world's most profitable - has experienced a dramatic change in the last few months. &lt;a href="w%3ADanske%20bank"&gt;Danske bank&lt;/a&gt;, one of &lt;a href="w%3ADenmark"&gt;Denmark's&lt;/a&gt; leading banks recently announced the purchase of &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Irish%20Bank"&gt;National Irish Bank&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3ABank%20of%20Scotland"&gt;The Bank of Scotland&lt;/a&gt; also recently announced its entry into the Irish retail banking sector by purchasing the &lt;a href="w%3AESB"&gt;ESB&lt;/a&gt; chain of retail units for €120m. Both banks have said they intend to introduce significantly cheaper products to the market over the next twelve months. 

Both the Bank of Ireland, and its biggest competitor &lt;a href="w%3AAIB"&gt;AIB&lt;/a&gt; announced profits of over €1bn last year.

Thousands of protesters seized control of a second city in &lt;a href="w%3AKyrgyzstan"&gt;Kyrgyzstan&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href="w%3AAskar%20Akayev"&gt;President Askar Akayev&lt;/a&gt; ordered a probe into allegations that the elections were seriously flawed on Monday.

“The south of the country is under the control of the people. Now we should concentrate on [the capital of] &lt;a href="w%3ABishkek"&gt;Bishkek&lt;/a&gt;,” said former ambassador to Britain and opposition leader Roza Otunbayeva to &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Times"&gt;♡❤The Times♡❤&lt;/a&gt;. “We have only one demand — that Akayev should resign.”

President Akayev ordered the Central Election Commission and Supreme Court to begin an investigation into allegations that sparked the protests. According to his office, he ordered them "to pay particular attention to those districts where election results provoked extreme public reaction ... and tell people openly who is right and who is wrong."

About 1,000 protesters armed with flammable liquid and clubs seized the governor's building in &lt;a href="w%3AOsh"&gt;Osh&lt;/a&gt;, Kyrgyzstan's second-largest city. The crowd of protesters, which swelled to 2,000, then seized the regional police and security stations of the city located 300 kilometres south of &lt;a href="w%3ABishkek"&gt;Bishkek&lt;/a&gt;.

"This is a new day in our history," said an opposition official named Omurbek Tekebayev. He also said the opposition would hold elections for alternative executive bodies throughout the country, and that they plan to call the presidential election, which is scheduled for October of 2005, within three months.

According to Tekebayev, the deputy regional police chief has joined the opposition and will be in charge of police under the new regional government.

Elsewhere in the country, at least 17,000 people continued to protest the alleged &lt;a href="w%3Aelectoral%20fraud"&gt;electoral fraud&lt;/a&gt;.

Protesters also seized control of the southern city of Jalal-Abad on Sunday.

STOCKHOLM, Sweden. 21 March 2005

The Swedish Post Office announced the famous stamp engraver, &lt;a href="w%3ACzeslaw%20Slania"&gt;Czeslaw Słania&lt;/a&gt;, died in the night of Thursday, 17 March.

Born in &lt;a href="w%3ACzeladz"&gt;Czeladź&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APoland"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; in October 1921, he was trained at the &lt;a href="w%3AKrakow"&gt;Kraków&lt;/a&gt; School of Fine Arts from 1945. While still a student, he was hired by Poland's printing bureau and began a career as an engraver, producing his first postage stamp for Poland in 1951.

In 1956 Słania moved to &lt;a href="w%3ASweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;, where three years later he began work for the Swedish Post Office and became their chief engraver. He produced over 1,000 stamps for Sweden and 28 other countries. His work is of such recognized quality and detail that he is one of the very few "household names" among philatelists. Some specialize in collecting his work alone. His 1,000th stamp was the magnificent ♡❤"Great Deeds by Swedish Kings"♡❤ by David Klöcker Ehrenstrahl in 2000, which is listed in the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AGuinness%20Book%20of%20World%20Records"&gt;Guinness Book of World Records&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. He was also engaged in engraving banknotes for many countries, recent examples of his work including the Prime Ministerial portraits on the front of the new Canadian $5 and $100 bills.

Słania was active until the end of his life, delivering his last completed stamp that commemorated the 60th anniversary of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations General Assembly&lt;/a&gt;, in February 2005.

Longtime &lt;a href="Los%20Angeles"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; architect &lt;a href="w%3AThom%20Mayne"&gt;Thom Mayne&lt;/a&gt; was awarded this year's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APritzker%20Architecture%20Prize"&gt;Pritzker Architecture Prize&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Established in 1979 to honor "consistent and significant contributions to humanity," the prize is considered by many to be the highest honor in the field. The award includes a bronze medallion and US$100,000. Mayne was the first American to receive it in 14 years; previous American recipients include &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Venturi"&gt;Robert Venturi&lt;/a&gt; (1991) and &lt;a href="w%3AFrank%20Gehry"&gt;Frank Gehry&lt;/a&gt; (1989).

Mayne earned his architecture degree from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Southern%20California"&gt;University of Southern California&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 1968. A few years later he founded his own architecture school, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASouthern%20California%20Institute%20of%20Architecture"&gt;Southern California Institute of Architecture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which remains to this day. He then moved to Los Angeles, where in addition to running a firm, Morphosis, he teaches architecture at &lt;a href="UCLA"&gt;UCLA&lt;/a&gt;.

Mayne's earlier work, considered "angry" and "brooding", was outside of the architectural mainstream. His style was often called bold and audacious. This style has recently become more accepted, as Morphosis won contracts to design government buildings in California, Oregon, and Washington, DC. The firm also designed an Olympic village in &lt;a href="Queens%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Queens&lt;/a&gt;, in preparation for the city's 2012 Olympics bid.

On receiving the prize, Mayne said, "This is such a big deal...it is not in my nature to think about being the one who prevails. For my whole life, I've always seen myself as an outsider."

Volunteers began a 60 day bed-rest marathon on March 19 to study simulated &lt;a href="w%3AWeightlessness"&gt;weightlessness&lt;/a&gt; effects on women astronauts. The study, &lt;a href="http%3A//spaceflight.esa.int/wise"&gt;Women International Space Simulation for Exploration&lt;/a&gt;(WISE), is conducted at the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.medes.fr/Home.html"&gt;MEDES Space Clinic&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AToulouse"&gt;Toulouse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;.

The 12 women, selected from 1600 applicants hailing from &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="w%3AGreat%20Britain"&gt;Great Britain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFinland"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANetherlands"&gt;The Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APoland"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ACzech%20Republic"&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt; began the study after a 20 day screening for baseline comparison data as the study progressed.

The women will conduct all activities from eating, bathing, and reading while lying in hospital beds tilted headfirst at a six degree angle. This particular position, called head-down tilt bed rest was determined from previous studies to remove the vertical load of gravity on the body, inducing changes similar to what astronauts in a genuine weightless environment experience &lt;a href="http%3A//www.medes.fr/Clinic/Experiments/LTBRF/PublicSection/En/Call_for_candidates_en.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Long term exposure to weightlessness creates a number of physiological and psychological problems in astronauts such as:
<ul>
BULLET::::- Reduced capacity for physical exertion
BULLET::::- Muscle atrophy
BULLET::::- Affects of confinement and isolation
BULLET::::- Impaired circulatory function

</ul>
A total of 24 women will participate in the study. A second group of 12 will join in September.

Three groups of eight women each will be studied over the course of the two campaigns of bed rest. One group will serve as a control, receiving no specific treatments, the second will exercise, while the third will receive nutritional supplements.

The study is designed to fill in gaps of knowledge on the differences between men and women during extended weightlessness. It also aims to develop countermeasures for reducing the debilitating effects of long spaceflights.

Participating agencies in the study include the &lt;a href="w%3AESA"&gt;European Space Agency&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3ACNES"&gt;French Space Agency&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Space%20Agency"&gt;Canadian Space Agency&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3AESA"&gt;European Space Agency&lt;/a&gt; (ESA) Council approved a cooperation agreement on March 17 between the &lt;a href="w%3AISRO"&gt;Indian Space Research Organization&lt;/a&gt; (ISRO) and the ESA for &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AChandrayan"&gt;Chandrayan-1&lt;/a&gt; moon satellite mission. The Chandrayan-1 will be India's first moon mission attempt.

Europe will, under the agreement, provide and support three instruments for the lunar explorer: CIXS-2, Chandrayan-1 Imaging X-Ray Spectrometer; SARA; a Sub-keV Atom Reflecting Analyzer, and SIR-2, a Near-Infrared Spectrometer. Europe will support hardware for the HEX, High-Energy X-ray Spectrometer. Data from these instruments will be turned over to the ESA for distribution to ESA member states. These instruments are the same as the ones carried onboard ESA's &lt;a href="w%3ASMART-1"&gt;SMART-1&lt;/a&gt; moon exploration spacecraft.

ISRO plans to launch the half-ton Chandrayan sometime before 2008 for a two year mission to study the &lt;a href="w%3Asolar%20system"&gt;solar system&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AMoon"&gt;Moon&lt;/a&gt;. The satellite will be boosted by India's &lt;a href="w%3APolar%20Satellite%20Launch%20Vehicle"&gt;Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle&lt;/a&gt;.

The ISRO has been placing satellites in Earth orbit since 1975 and has developed its own launch vehicles and satellites for telecommunications and weather forecasting. A manned mission had been previously considered but was deemed too costly to carry through&lt;a href="http%3A//www.rednova.com/news/display/%3Fid%3D78614"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Launched yesterday with funding for bandwidth and storage donated by &lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20Archive"&gt;Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt;, a new website called ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AOurmedia"&gt;Ourmedia&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ aspires to serve as a global repository for free content, which donors are encouraged to license for re-use by others.

Started by Internet Archive employee J.D. Lasica and Marc Canter, who founded Macromind, which became &lt;a href="w%3AMacromedia"&gt;Macromedia&lt;/a&gt;, ♡❤Ourmedia♡❤ has a team of what Lasica refers to as "moderators" that will ensure that the site does not host pornography or copyrighted or defamatory materials. Their &lt;a href="http%3A//ourmedia.org/rules%7C%26quot%3BSite"&gt;rules"&lt;/a&gt; note that the moderators will be the "sole arbiters" of what will be hosted on the site.

Lasica and Canter have been working on the site with a cadre of volunteers since they met at a Supernova conference 9 months ago, according to Lasica's blog. The site was started in the summer of 2004, and announced its official launch on March 21, 2005.

While the server initially hosting Ourmedia was not able to handle the load imposed when publicised on tech news sites such as &lt;a href="w%3ASlashdot"&gt;Slashdot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABoingBoing"&gt;BoingBoing&lt;/a&gt; (reported by ITConversations, among others), it has now been replaced and improved. According to a post on the Ourmedia blog, "The transition to a new dedicated server has been completed, the database configuration has been given an overhaul, and some of the code has been cleaned up."

The software running Ourmedia is an open source content management system called Bryght, described at Bryght.com as "the Drupal core set of modules plus a set of contributed Drupal modules." Ourmedia describes their system as being "alpha" quality; they note that because all of the media files on their site are being hosted by the Internet Archive, users will need to register with both sites with the same username and password until the registration systems are unified.

Surfwax, Inc., a &lt;a href="w%3Ametasearch%20engine"&gt;metasearch engine&lt;/a&gt; and knowledge-tool provider announced its release of Wikiwax, a new portal for searching Wikipedia article titles. This is the latest addition to its offerings of narrowly focused search portals, such as its News Accumulator and ShopEasier shopping portal.

Wikiwax claims to index over 600,000 Wikipedia terms, and its list of titles was last updated sometime in March, 2005. Once you enter terms into the search field, a menu of matching titles is shown; selecting one of the titles takes you directly to its Wikipedia entry.

Wikiwax uses a Surfwax feature called ♡❤LookAhead♡❤ to suggest auto-completions of search terms as a user types them. It matches both articles whose titles start with the search terms, and articles containing those terms in that order. For example, a search for "Wales, Jimmy" would find the article "Jimmy Wales". A search for "The Earth" would also match "The Earth Stood Still, The Day". Surfwax offered visitors this manner of ♡❤LookAhead♡❤ auto-complete searching for over a year.

Other Surfwax projects include Nextaris, an all-in-one "information exchange" portal offering searching/uploading/sharing/publishing/social-networking, and search packages targeted to specific industries, such as the Surfwax Scholar portal offered to educational institutions.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%2C%20California"&gt;Los Angeles, California&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — Four of six national television broadcast networks recently wooed potential advertisers for the 2005-2006 season with programming offerings in the new development phase. These included &lt;a href="w%3ANBC"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFox%20Broadcasting%20Company"&gt;Fox&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20WB"&gt;The WB&lt;/a&gt;. Two other networks, &lt;a href="w%3ACBS"&gt;CBS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AUPN"&gt;UPN&lt;/a&gt;, plan to preview their offerings March 24.

After four years of focusing on high-profile reality television, network executives are turning to the past for inspiration on scripted series. Some networks said they are "more consciously aggressive about developing shows" that recall such classics as ♡❤Taxi♡❤ and ♡❤Barney Miller♡❤, Craig Erwich, a programming executive for Fox, told ♡❤USA Today♡❤. In the same report, Kevin Reilly, NBC entertainment chief said, "I don't think the answer has to be that it's groundbreaking or something you've never seen before." 

But at least one ad buyer had reservations about the rear-view mirror technique. "Every network seems to be looking back rather than forward for programming ideas. The reminiscence factor may be good if you are looking for an older audience, but it may not be a way to bring in the younger audiences," Laura Caraccioli-Davis, senior vice president and director of Starcom Entertainment told ♡❤Mediaweek♡❤ magazine.

<h1>Ten dead on Minnesota Indian reservation after school shooting</h1>

A 17-year-old &lt;a href="w%3AMinnesota"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; student is believed to have shot his grandfather and grandmother, drove his grandfather's squad car to the high school, and shot a security guard, a teacher and five other classmates, later committing suicide. This happened at 3pm local time on Monday (2100 UTC), and as many as 14 others were injured before the rampage subsided.

One witness said of the gunman, he was "grinning and waving".

"I looked him in the eye and ran in the room, and that's when I hid," Sondra Hegstrom told ♡❤The Pioneer of Bemidji♡❤. "You could hear a girl saying, 'No, Jeff, quit, quit. Leave me alone. What are you doing?"

Today's incident marks the highest death toll yet in US school shootings since the &lt;a href="w%3AColumbine%20High%20School%20massacre"&gt;Columbine High School massacre&lt;/a&gt; in April 1999. There were 15 people shot in &lt;a href="w%3AJefferson%20County%2C%20Colorado"&gt;Jefferson County&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href="w%3ALittleton%2C%20Colorado"&gt;Littleton, Colorado&lt;/a&gt;, in the Columbine shooting.

Police are still investigating any possible motive.

"It will probably take us throughout the night to really put the whole picture together," said &lt;a href="w%3AFBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; spokesman Paul McCabe in a briefing to the press. "We do have evidence that we believe that the shooter is dead," he continued, "we believe he was acting alone."

Reporters were asked to leave the area, located on The Red Lake reservation, by tribal authorities.

"The events that took place today involving the shootings at the Red Lake High School make this one of the darkest and most painful occurrences in the history of our tribe," said Floyd Jourdain Jr., Chairman of the Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians. The Indian band is made up of about 5,100 people, living on 825,000 acres of land in the northern part of the state.

Minnesota's last school shooting was in September 2003, when two students were fatally shot at Rocori High School. That incident had statewide implications, causing a hearing on expansion of tribal gaming in Minnesota to be canceled for the day.

"We ask Minnesotans to help comfort the families and friends of the victims who are suffering unimaginable pain by extending prayers and expressions of support," said a statement from Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty.

Starting from April 4, the Romanian Commercial Bank (♡❤Banca Comercială Română♡❤, or BCR), the country's largest bank, will launch a smart card system for all its ATM network as well as its &lt;a href="%3Aw%3APOS"&gt;point-of-sale&lt;/a&gt; terminals in more than 5,000 stores across &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARomania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;. While the system will be enabled to work with these cards from April, the smart cards themselves will only be issued to account holders in the second half of the year.

&lt;a href="%3Aw%3Asmart%20card"&gt;Smart cards&lt;/a&gt; in a banking context are cards which contain information on a chip and can permit greater security and control of transactions. BCR is the first Romanian bank to use this technology.

Total &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARomania"&gt;Romanian&lt;/a&gt; Visa card transactions rose by 60% in 2004 in comparison to 2003.
They reached a value of US$2.8 billion. This was due to a 30% increase in the number of cards issued, as well as greater spending by Romanians. The results are based on both ATM transactions and purchases in various stores.

According to Visa, purchases with Visa cards almost doubled to $164.4 million. The number of people in Romania who pay with Visa cards rose by 130%, reaching 3.3 million customers. The most popular cards were Visa Gold, with nearly 800,000 cards issued in 2004, and Visa Electron, with more than 600,000 cards issued.

Visa cards are an increasingly popular way of consumer spending in Romania and, by the end of 2004, they were accepted at 15,727 locations across the country, an increase of 17.7% in comparison to 2003.

&lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARomania"&gt;Romanian&lt;/a&gt; mobile telephony giant &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AConnex%20GSM"&gt;Connex&lt;/a&gt;, recently bought by &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AVodafone"&gt;Vodafone&lt;/a&gt;, announced the company is planning to introduce 3G services and video telephony. Romanian cities effected by the change are: &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABucharest"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ACluj-Napoca"&gt;Cluj-Napoca&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ATimisoara"&gt;Timişoara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABrasov"&gt;Braşov&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AConstanta"&gt;Constanţa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3APloiesti"&gt;Ploieşti&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ACraiova"&gt;Craiova&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AIasi"&gt;Iaşi&lt;/a&gt;. The only 3G-enabled model currently sold by Connex is the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ANokia"&gt;Nokia&lt;/a&gt; 6630.

Ken Campbell, chief marketing officer of Connex, said he expects the 3G introduction to be successful, given the Romanian interest in video telephony services. Connex's 3G technology will also provide a permanent connection to the Internet, access to multimedia content, live video streaming and video conferencing. The network also provides mobile broadband speeds of up to 384 kbps.

Connex is currently the second-largest mobile telephony company in Romania, with nearly five million customers. It is one of Romanian's best recognised companies.

The Romanian defence minister Teodor Atanasiu will start a two-day tour of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABulgaria"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt; today by visiting the country's main air-force base at Graf Ignatievo. Atanasiu will meet with Bulgarian prime minister &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASimeon%20Saxe-Coburg%20Gotha"&gt;Simeon Saxe-Coburg Gotha&lt;/a&gt; and defence minister Nikolay Svinarov. The theme of the visit is the deepening of bilaterial military co-operation between the two neighbouring countries.
Romania and Bulgaria both joined &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ANATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; in 2004. They are also expected to host US military bases in the near future as the &lt;a href="w%3AUSA"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt; wishes to move its European troops from Germany into &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASoutheastern%20Europe"&gt;Southeastern Europe&lt;/a&gt;. The deepening of military ties between the countries is expected to increase their strategic military position in the world. Both Romania and Bulgaria were major participants in the US-led invasion of &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; and the resulting peacekeeping efforts. Romania currently supplies one of the world's largest contingents of troops in Iraq, with nearly 1000 people.

Between 10 to 15 of Bucharest's 61 Unirii Boulevard residents will be able to connect to the &lt;a href="w%3AInternet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt; through their &lt;a href="w%3ADomestic%20AC%20power%20plugs%20%26amp%3B%20sockets"&gt;power lines&lt;/a&gt;. Starting from &lt;a href="w%3AMay"&gt;May&lt;/a&gt; of this year, a trial was organised by &lt;a href="w%3AElectrica%20Muntenia%20Sud"&gt;Electrica Muntenia Sud&lt;/a&gt;, the electricity company of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABucharest"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt; and Southern &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARomania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;.

The technology, known as &lt;a href="%3Aw%3APower%20line%20communication"&gt;Power Line Communications&lt;/a&gt; (PLC), enables the transmission of broadband Internet and fixed line telephony data through the existing electrical power network. The technology, in use by 13,000 people in 30 countries throughout the world, is considered very advantageous due to its high speeds and low cost. It uses infrastructure that is already available in most people's homes.

Once the Unirii Boulevard trial concludes, and if it is successful, Electrica Muntenia Sud will roll-out the PLC Internet plan to the mass market. It is expected to be embraced by Romanians because its data transfer speed of 5Mps is available for a monthly subscription fee of less than 15 euro.

Bucharest is the first city in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASoutheastern%20Europe"&gt;Southeastern Europe&lt;/a&gt; to trial such innovative technology.

<h1>EU looks set to continue arms embargo on China</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=EU%20looks%20set%20to%20continue%20arms%20embargo%20on%20China&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AEU"&gt;EU&lt;/a&gt; is likely to delay the end of its arms embargo on &lt;a href="w%3APRC"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; until next year, European diplomats said. The delay is a response to legislation passed in China earlier this month, authorising the use of military force against &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; if it attempts to officially secede from the mainland.

The EU came under intense pressure from the &lt;a href="w%3AUSA"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; to not lift the embargo imposed after the &lt;a href="w%3ATiananmen%20Square%20massacre"&gt;Tiananmen Square massacre&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3A1989"&gt;1989&lt;/a&gt;, when the Chinese government suppressed pro-democracy demonstrators. The US &lt;a href="w%3ACongress"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt; threatened that it would retaliate against the EU if it lifted the arms embargo, by blocking the approval of technology transfer licenses.

The EU has made clear the delay is only temporary, and their commitment from last December to lift the embargo still stood.

European Commission spokeswoman Emma Udwin added, "The timescale is completely open, no deadline. [The] Luxembourg presidency said in January that they wanted to lift the embargo within their presidency, but there is no obligation to do that."
China defended its anti-secession law and responded to the ban by saying, "The EU ban on arms sales to China is political discrimination against China and out of keeping with the times," Liu Jianchao, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman told a news conference.

"We hope the EU will make the political decision to lift the ban as soon as possible," Liu continued. "It's unreasonable to link China pushing the EU to lift the arms embargo and China passing the anti-secession law," he said.

On Sunday, British foreign secretary &lt;a href="w%3AJack%20Straw"&gt;Jack Straw&lt;/a&gt; in a British television interview commented that lifting the arms embargo was "more difficult rather than less difficult," and that China's anti-secession law towards Taiwan created "a difficult political environment."

However, diplomats have told ♡❤Le Monde♡❤ that the UK was lobbying for a push-back of the decision to 2006, particularly among various EU countries more focuses on human rights issues.

The UK continues to support ending the embargo in principle, and Prime Minister Blair has envisioned a successful decision by the summer. While Britain is sensitive to American pressure, it nonetheless wants to assure a positive road leading up to its assuming of EU presidency duties on July 1.

&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Secretary%20of%20State"&gt;US Secretary of State&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACondoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; characterized Mr. Straw's remarks as "sobering comments" during her stay in &lt;a href="w%3ABeijing"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt; on Monday.

"After all, it is American forces here in the Pacific that have played the role of security guarantor," she said.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
The Head Minister of the Institutional Security Cabinet of &lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;, General Jorge Felix, and the director-general of the Brazilian Intelligence Agency (Abin), Mauro Marcelo de Lima e Silva, testifying before a commission of deputies and senators, said documents may be incorrect. They maintain the Brazilian magazine ♡❤Veja♡❤, in its article "FARC's tentacles in Brazil", should not be used. 

This weekend, ♡❤Veja♡❤ presented testimonies by people who allegedly worked on Abin's FARC-PT investigation. These contradict the explanations that General Felix gave to the commission.

<h2>The ♡❤Veja's♡❤ story</h2>
Last week, the magazine ♡❤Veja♡❤ reported that the Workers' Party (PT) received 5 million dollars to be used for the political campaign of candidates in 2002 from the &lt;a href="w%3AColumbia"&gt;Colombian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACommunism"&gt;Communist&lt;/a&gt; armed group &lt;a href="w%3AFARC"&gt;Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia&lt;/a&gt; (FARC-EP). The news appeared on by Brazilian television chanells Globo and Record.
♡❤Veja♡❤ said that it used as its sources the documents from Abin and the allegations of Abin's employees. The Head Minister of the Institutional Security Cabinet of Brazil's General Jorge Felix, and the director-general of the Brazilian Intelligence Agency (Abin), Mauro Marcelo de Lima e Silva, said that the documents were not reliable.

The official Abin version can be seen on &lt;a href="http%3A//www.abin.gov.br/abin/nota_internet_170305.htm"&gt;its website.&lt;/a&gt; The agency stores and archives all data collected by the intelligence service, including data that do not fulfill all Abin's criteria for consistency and accuracy. Every kind of document remains in Abin archive so it can be re-evaluated in the future. According to General Felix, Abin archives may contain data that are not relevant, tendentious or completely untrue. The documents mentioned by ♡❤Veja♡❤ are this sort of data.

According to &lt;a href="http%3A//www.senado.gov.br/agencia/verNoticia.aspx%3FcodNoticia%3D44271"&gt;Brazilian Federal Senate's&lt;/a&gt; website, General Félix told "the documents were archived because they don't deserve credit, and they don't present any proof related to the allegations contained therein".

The general said: "Of course Abin monitores all FARC activities, it is part of its job; however, in this specific case, there is no sustainable argument, and there is any credibility. Therefore, the papers are archived."

On 21 March ♡❤Veja♡❤ published another article named: "They know everything about it", contradicting Abin. The article stated that two people -- a alleged spy who was in a meeting where a supposed donation by the FARC member father Medina took place, and his former Abin superior, Colonel Eduardo Adolfo Ferreira -- had said that the documents were not merely information ignored by the agency, due to a lack of evidence, as the General Félix argued.

♡❤Veja's♡❤ wrote that the documents that mentioned the alleged FARC-PT relationship were considered very important by Abin. ♡❤Veja's♡❤ story told the documents were archived and the investigations into their contents ceased after the victory of the Brazilian President &lt;a href="w%3ALuiz%20In%C3%A1cio%20Lula%20da%20Silva"&gt;Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva&lt;/a&gt; (PT). 

♡❤Veja♡❤ has since claimed to have interviewed the Albin spy again, whose identity the magazine chooses not to reveal, since he is allegedly still active.

According to the spy, he infiltrated the labour union movement twenty years ago. His colleagues were PT members and Communists and his task was informing the intelligence agency about the Brazilian labor movement.

According to ♡❤Veja♡❤, the spy says that he came upon the FARC case accidentally. It happened when leftists invited him to be part of a pro-FARC committee, in defense of the Colombian guerrillas. The spy claims to have agreed and he began to frequent the meetings, which were almost always secret.

♡❤Veja♡❤ says that, on April 13, 2002, the spy took part of a meeting together with other leftists, in Coração Vermelho (Red Heart) hacienda, near &lt;a href="w%3ABrasilia"&gt;Brasilia&lt;/a&gt;. ♡❤Veja♡❤ reports that the spy heard father Olivério Medina, representative of the FARC, announcing that he would donate 5 million dollars for the campaign of the Brazilian president Luis Inácio Lula da Silva in 2002.

Furthermore, according to ♡❤Veja♡❤, the Abin's spy said: " Immediately I left the meeting, on April 13 and met my Abin contact, near a highway close to the Coração Vermelho hacienda. There, inside the car, I wrote the my dispatches about FARC money going to the PT. I had listened the story for the first time. Father Olivério Medina was quite happy."

The Brazilian magazine continues reporting the alleged spy story:

♡❤On April 22, I listened again to this story. It was during a meeting in a labour union. One of the friends of the FARC, a Chilean militant, said that they were 5 million dollars and that the money had been already distributed for the PT.♡❤

♡❤The Abin found the history so important that my contact, colonel Eduardo Adolfo Ferreira, invited me to dinner (...) ♡❤

♡❤My stories are based on the facts that I see and hear. I do not know if the money was delivered. I know that, among FARC's friends, this matter was treated responsibly and secretly. The money would come from Trinidad and Tobago to 300 PT businessmen, who would distribute it for the party's committees. Moreover, I wrote this in the reports that I delivered to the colonel.♡❤

♡❤Veja♡❤ claims to have interviewed Colonel Eduardo Adolfo Ferreira who was Abin's employee for seven years and who allegedly coordinated the investigation on the relations between the FARC and the Workers' Party (PT). 

Colonel Eduardo Adolfo Ferreira, aged 49, worked for Abin during seven years. He left his job in 2003 because of alleged differences related to the way the investigations were being carried out after the victory of Workers' Party (PT) in 2002 campaign. The colonel works for the Military Police in the Federal District at present time.

♡❤Veja♡❤ said that the colonel told there are at least two dozen reports describing the PT-FARC relationships in Abin. Colonel Ferreira says that the document 0095/3100 mentioned by ♡❤Veja♡❤ last week is not even the most important one.

♡❤Veja♡❤ said that Colonel Ferreira told the documents were not archived by Abin because they were dubious. The colonel said that the documents that describe the relations between PT and FARC were taken very seriously by Abin.

According to ♡❤Veja♡❤, Colonel Ferreira said that in order to avoid the unathourized release of information, the reports were written inside the intelligence director José Milton Campana's office at that time . Campana got a promotion to Abin assistant-director by the current PT government.

Inside Campana's office, other people were in direct contact with the papers: an analyst and an adviser.

According to ♡❤Veja♡❤, the colonel said: "We finished three reports on the case". The colonel said that Abin, with the help of the Federal Police, had traced part of the money that might have come from FARC to PT. There were three payment authorisations, for 1 million dollars each, with indications that they were part of the FARC's money. The colonel said: "we cannot affirm that it was the guerrillas' money for sure. There were indications. Strong indications, but the investigation stopped after the PT won the elections and I left Abin."

The magazine ♡❤Veja♡❤ emphasized that it is not deliberately accusing the Workers' Party (PT). The magazine warns that some politicians can try to obtain political advantages with the news.

Brazilian Senator Demóstenes Torres (PFL) said: " If both declarations are true, they reveal that Abin appeared to the Congress commission and it concealed the truth of the parliament's members. It is serious." The senator told he will ask an secret audience to hear the Abin's spy and the Colonel Eduardo Adolfo Ferreira.

General Jorge Felix refused to comment the case explaining that everything were already had been told to the deputies and senators commission.

♡❤Veja♡❤♡s last article:"They know everything about it" was not covered by most part of Brazilian newspapers. However it appeared on television and on some journalist's blogs.

It is known that the FARC and PT politics have met since 1990. Many of these meetings occurred during the enconteurs of the Foro de São Paulo. 

The peace talks between Colombia and the FARC guerrilla started in 1998, during government of the Colombian President Andres Pastrana Arango.

The FARC had sent a letter to the XI Foro de São Paulo meeting congratulating Lula Da Silva for his victory in 2002 elections (&lt;a href="http%3A//www.estadao.com.br/agestado/noticias/2002/dez/04/313.htm"&gt;Farc felicitam Brasil pela vitória de Lula - O Estado de São Paulo&lt;/a&gt;).

In a interview to Valquíria Rey, from &lt;a href="http%3A//www.bbc.co.uk/portuguese/noticias/2003/030306_colombiafarc1vrra.shtml"&gt;BBC, in March 6, 2003&lt;/a&gt; FARC commander Pastor Alape praised the independent stance of the Brazil. He told he didn't think that Brazilian government would sign any statement including FARC on the list of international terrorist organizations.
If the Brazilian government considered the FARC as a terrorist group, all FARC members could be arrested inside Brazilian territory. 

Some analysts say that the Communist Colombian guerrilla aims to extend its influence throughout other countries in Latin America.&lt;a href="http%3A//washingtontimes.com/world/20050321-091831-2085r.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.caracol.com.co/nota.asp%3Fid%3D142347"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

<h2>Modifications in Abin</h2>

After the PT candidate Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva assumed the government the most visible change was the association of Abin with the Cuban service of intelligence.

Abin signed at least an agreement of cooperation with the Cuban service of intelligence. The Abin general-director Mauro Marcelo de Lima e Silva was in Havana, in February, this year, discussing an agreement between Abin and the Cuban service of intelligence, the Dirección General de Inteligência (DGI). &lt;a href="http%3A//noticias.terra.com.br/brasil/interna/0%2C%2COI482000-EI306%2C00.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.primeiraleitura.com.br/auto/leia.php%3Fid%3D40822"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="http%3A//www.estadao.com.br/rss/agestado/2005/mar/04/7.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The Brazilian government denied his agents would be trained in Cuba. The government affirmed that it was only an mere bilateral cooperation agreement to resolve problems related to the terrorism and the traffic of weapons. &lt;a href="http%3A//br.news.yahoo.com/050312/6/sgne.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

<h2>Workers' Party defense</h2>
The Workers' Party (PT) released an official statement signed by the National President José Genoino repudiating the magazine's article and denying all presented facts. Part of the note tells:

The note says that the article is irresponsible, that it comments on facts without any sustentable evidence . It still says that the magazine denies itself when later in the text it affirms that it did not find any solid indication to proof that 5 million dollars were really sent to PT by the FARC .

Another note from the Workers' Party (PT), of February 16, 2002 called 
&lt;a href="http%3A//babelfish.altavista.com/babelfish/tr%3Furl%3Dhttp%253A//www.lula.org.br/noticias/not_int.asp%253Fnot_cod%253D1071%2526cf_cod%253D30%2526sis_cod%253D37%26amp%3Blp%3Dpt_en"&gt;"The truth about Colombia and the FARC - and PT"&lt;/a&gt; tries to clarify the relationship between the party and the FARC. A portion of this note says that:

The leader of the government Deputy Aloizio Mercadante (PT) said: "If this donation existed, which I do not believe, it was not done to PT, but to individuals who are alleged connected to the party. Case they were identified and they were part of the party, they would be forced to leave."

The deputy Paulo Rocha (PT) said that the magazine does not have any proof that the money transference from FARC for PT occurred. "The magazine admits by itself that that there are no documents verifying any insinuation of this nature", he adds.

Deputy Paulo Rocha also says that the meetings between FARC delegates with Brazilian politicians were part of a FARC attempt of establishing a diplomatic representation in Brazil, which did not happened. So, according to the deputy, there were meetings between the father Olivério Medina, who worked as FARC ambassador, with parliamentarians of diverse parties. The deputy said: "Meetings can have happened, but there is no political and financial relation with the PT." For the deputy there are no reasons to create a congress investigation commission, as suggested by oppostion parties. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.emilianojose.com.br/texto_noticias.php%3FID%3D427"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The Senator Cristovam Buarque(PT) said that the case was a "sad episode, because it affected a party's credibility without anybody seeing any proof." In his opinion the case repercussion was positive "because it demonstrated that Brazil is a country capable of placing the head of its intelligence agency before the entire press and all the members of Congress and exit calmly, without a dent to its credibility."&lt;a href="http%3A//internacional.radiobras.gov.br/espanhol/materia_i_2004.php%3Fmateria%3D219287%26amp%3Beditoria%3DPO"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

According to the Abin directors General Jorge Armando Félix and Mauro Marcelo de Lima e Silva there is no solid evidences relating finantial help from FARC to PT. Because of that, there is no reason to start a new investigation and the case must remain archived.

The ♡❤Veja♡❤ admitted in its article that it is possible that the FARC delegate father Medina did not said the true when he told the FARC would donate 5 million dollars to PT campaign in Coração Vermelho hacienda. Also the magazine admitted that it cannot proof the donation occurred and it says that it is possible that the Abin documents are untrue. The magazine ♡❤Veja♡❤ said it didn't involve the Workers' Party, as an organization, in the case. 

The National Secretary of International Relations for Workers'Party (PT), Paulo Ferreira, says that the Central Bank records show that no money entered in Brazil from Trynidad and Tobago during 2002 and 2003. &lt;a href="http%3A//noticias.terra.com.br/brasil/interna/0%2C%2COI488723-EI1194%2C00.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The leftist Antônio Carlos Viana told to the Brazilian newspaper &lt;a href="http%3A//www.mre.gov.br/portugues/noticiario/nacional/selecao_detalhe.asp%3FID_RESENHA%3D116250"&gt;Correio Braziliense&lt;/a&gt; that during the encounter between FARC and PT members in Coração Vermelho hacienda there weren't any discussion about money. He said:"We believe that the path to peace in Colombia is people and Brazilian government recognizing the FARC. However we can't take any responsibility by the FARC's actions and we deny categorically any discussion about money to electoral purposes in Brazil."
According to an article in &lt;a href="http%3A//www.vermelho.org.br/diario/2005/0313/0313_pt-farc.asp"&gt;PCdoB website&lt;/a&gt;: "none of the participants of the enconteur in Coração Vermelho hacienda says that father Olivério Medina offered money to PT".

The President of PT in &lt;a href="w%3ASanta%20Catarina"&gt;Santa Catarina&lt;/a&gt; Milton Mendes says:"(...)I am perplex and honestly convinced that the article is shameful, irresponsible and a pamphlet."&lt;a href="http%3A//www.pt.org.br/site/artigos/artigos_int.asp%3Fcod%3D812"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He criticizes ♡❤Veja♡❤ because the magazine said no proofs were found related to the money donation.

Accusations against PT can be used by the political opposition in negative propaganda.

The Congress Commission which heard the Abin's directors considered the case closed on alleged FARC donation to PT.

<h2>Some Brazilian comments</h2>
Some opinion excerpts from the 
O Estado de São Paulo &lt;a href="http%3A//forum.estadao.com.br/forum/materia/view/05031241"&gt;Forum&lt;/a&gt;:

♡❤♡Magazines and newspapers must be careful with explosive news♡❤♡ &lt;br&gt;
♡❤I am not PT sympathizant and I have already criticized some points about the party and the government(...) There is no saint in any political party, neither in the several religions, neither in the Church. However, I can't believe that someone inside PT, after I have some knowledge about its leaders, might have received any contribution from the FARC (...) Fake dossiers have already been created relating the PSDB with foreign bank accounts and these news were denied later. The FARC donation is a campaign gossip which is already began by PT unfortunately.♡❤ &amp;mdash; Antonio Carlos Rocha da Silva / São Paulo

♡❤♡Possibilities♡❤♡ &lt;br&gt;
♡❤The news published in Veja magazine, March 13, this year, is really daring. Saying that the PT received money from the FARC is serious and grave. If the magazine published the story, there must be, at least, some kind of information.(...)The Workers'Party members deny the fact, with no exception. But you must remember that most of them have belonged to armed groups during the militar regime.(..)If the PT did not prosecute the magazine, the doubt can cause some harm.(...)♡❤ &amp;mdash; Jorge Cortás Sader Filho / Niterói

♡❤♡New story, old subject♡❤♡ &lt;br&gt;
♡❤The FARC/PT connection is older thant the Bible draft. In 2002 a deputy tryed to create a CPI [Congress Commission of Investigation] to investigate the donation, however he didn't get enough signatures. (...)If the article is lying, the PT have to proof and expose the magazine, then prosecute it.(...) The worst blind person is who doesn't want to see. This kind of person, the fanatic voter, is not helping in nothing Brazil.♡❤ &amp;mdash; Sonia / Rio de Janeiro

Sun Hudson, a six-month old Texas baby died last week when health care providers at Texas Children's Hospital in removed his life support system over the objections of his mother. The action was authorized under the 1999 Futile Care Law which was signed into law by then-Gov. &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;.

Under the Texas Futile Care Law, health care workers are allowed to remove expensive life support for terminally ill patients if the patient or family is unable to pay the medical bills.

Sun Hudson's mother is dealing with the aftermath of that law. "This hospital was considered a miracle hospital. When it came to my son, they gave up in six months," Wanda Hudson told reporters how she was forced to give up medical control of her son. "I talked to him, I told him that I loved him. Inside of me, my son is still alive." 

The hospital had blocked the media from the child, despite mother's invitation to see the baby. "I wanted y'all to see my son for yourself. So you could see he was actually moving around. He was conscious," she said.

The event stirred national attention as it sparked comparisons to the &lt;a href="w%3ATerri%20Schiavo"&gt;Terri Schiavo&lt;/a&gt; case in Florida. A victim of severe, and otherwise terminal brain damage, Terri Schiavo's future is locked in a legal battle between her husband who wants to remove life support and her parents, who cite religious reasons for keeping their daughter alive.

Michael Schiavo, husband of Terri Schiavo, was asked about the Hudson situation on the March 21 edition of CNN's ♡❤Larry King Live.♡❤ When King asked how Mr. Schiavo felt when he learned that President Bush had signed such a law in Texas while he was governor, Schiavo was at a loss of words.

But Schiavo's lawyer did respond, saying, "Obviously, there's a tremendous amount of hypocrisy there ... it would lead one to believe that a lot of this was politically motivated, and I think that's what the American people have concluded." Schiavo's lawyer echoed the sentiments of Florida Representative Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, a Democrat, who raised the "hypocrisy" question when she first mentioned the 1999 Texas law issue on the House floor last week.

Over the weekend, President Bush signed a special federal law that moved jurisdiction of the Schiavo case out of the state of Florida and into the U.S. federal court system after Florida courts ruled that Michael Schiavo had the right to remove Terri's life support, which includes a feeding tube and intravenous liquids.

After signing the Schiavo Law Sunday, President Bush said, "It is wisest to always err on the side of life."

Police organized a search in the &lt;a href="w%3ASydenham%20Park"&gt;Sydenham Park&lt;/a&gt; area of south-east &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; after a local, Anthony Holder, was attacked by a 6ft long black animal while looking for his kitten in his back yard that borders a woodland.

Holder said the animal pounced, knocked him to the ground, and then he was "in its claws for about 30 seconds. Its teeth were out and I tried to defend myself and eventually I got the thing off my body." Holder was scratched all over his body and suffered swelling and bruising to his hand and the back of his head. He called the police at about 2:15 am while the animal sat in the garden next door.

While Holder was being treated by paramedics, the Metropolitan Police conducted a search of the area. A citizen and a police officer saw the creature, believed by some to be a &lt;a href="w%3Apanther"&gt;panther&lt;/a&gt;. Another officer also believed he saw the animal and reports it as approximately the size of a &lt;a href="w%3ALabrador%20Retriever"&gt;Labrador Retriever&lt;/a&gt;. The neighbourhood is being patrolled by an armed police response vehicle staffed by officers equipped with rifles and Taser stun guns.

Scotland Yard is currently seeking specialist advice from experts from the RSPCA and London Zoo. A spokeswoman said: "We are trying to establish exactly where the animal may have come from. In the meantime we are asking the public to be vigilant. If anyone does see the animal, do not approach it but dial &lt;a href="w%3A9-9-9"&gt;9-9-9&lt;/a&gt; immediately." 

People are also being advised to keep pets indoors.

Sightings of &lt;a href="w%3ABig%20cat"&gt;big cats&lt;/a&gt; have increased in recent years. The notion of a large predator in London was initially dismissed by scientists, but evidence from footprints and droppings has led to other conclusions. The British Big Cat Society estimates 50 to 100 are currently loose across &lt;a href="w%3AEngland"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;. Livestock has supposedly been attacked a number of times. Farmers near &lt;a href="w%3ABurford"&gt;Burford&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AOxfordshire"&gt;Oxfordshire&lt;/a&gt; have offered a &lt;a href="w%3A%C2%A3"&gt;£&lt;/a&gt;5,000 reward for the capture of a large black creature suspected of killing livestock in the area. However, there have been virtually no human encounters.

&lt;a href="w%3AImax"&gt;Imax&lt;/a&gt; cinemas in several southern US states have begun to refuse screening of films that deal with &lt;a href="w%3Aevolution"&gt;evolution&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3Abig%20bang"&gt;big bang&lt;/a&gt;, fearing they will drive away customers. This step follows pressure from customers claiming such films are blasphemous to the &lt;a href="w%3AChristianity"&gt;Christian religion&lt;/a&gt; and are counter to biblical teachings which fundamentalists take to be the literal word of God.

Some of the affected cinemas are located in science museums often visited by families. Carol Murray, the marketing director of the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History in &lt;a href="w%3ATexas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, commented that trial customers complained, "I really hate it when the theory of evolution is presented as fact," a view reflected by several others. Conversely, a producer of an Imax film entitled ♡❤Volcanoes of the Deep Sea♡❤, James Cameron, said that he was "surprised and somewhat offended" at some of the reactions.

Films suppressed by this controversy include ♡❤Cosmic Voyage♡❤ (which deals with the big bang), ♡❤Galapagos♡❤ (dealing with the development of evolutionary theory by &lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Darwin"&gt;Darwin&lt;/a&gt;) and ♡❤Volcanoes of the Deep Sea♡❤ (about deep-sea &lt;a href="w%3Athermophile"&gt;thermophiles&lt;/a&gt;).

Although this move only affects about a dozen Southern US cinemas, it has proved significant due to the manner in which Imax operates. Imax presentations are filmed and projected using specialized equipment in specially adapted theatres. Imax films also have tight production and marketing budgets. At any one time, an Imax film may be shown at only two dozen locations. As such, profits may be significantly reduced if just a few locations refuse to show a given film, swaying producers to avoid producing films on contentious subjects which may be construed by &lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20fundamentalism"&gt;Christian fundamentalists&lt;/a&gt; as blasphemous.

The &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Reserve"&gt;U.S. Federal Reserve&lt;/a&gt; (Fed) today raised interest rates by 0.25 of a percentage point to 2.75 percent. The increase in the federal funds rate, the interest that banks charge each other, is seen as an anti-inflationary measure and was widely expected by the financial community.

It is the seventh time the Fed has raised interest rates since June &lt;a href="w%3A2004"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt; when rates stood at just 1 percent -- a 46-year low.

The U.S. economy has been gaining strength since the economic downturn in 2001 and 2002. The rebound was largely fueled by historically low interest rates which enabled consumers to borrow much more money than they would have otherwise -- thus boosting personal consumption.

Twenty-four cars of a west-bound &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Pacific%20Railway"&gt;Canada Pacific&lt;/a&gt; train were thrown from the tracks after the train collided with a semi tractor-trailer in poor weather and visibility near &lt;a href="w%3ARegina%2C%20Saskatchewan"&gt;Regina, Saskatchewan&lt;/a&gt; around 11 a.m. Tuesday morning. The driver was rushed to hospital.

The accident took place on a level section of Highway 46 just north of Highway 1, about 25 kilometres east of Regina. The &lt;a href="RCMP"&gt;RCMP&lt;/a&gt; spokesperson reported the crossing is marked with lights, but weather may have played a role.

"Road conditions were wet and sloppy and it's foggy," &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Canadian%20Mounted%20Police"&gt;RCMP&lt;/a&gt; Cpl. Brian Jones said to the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation"&gt;CBC&lt;/a&gt;. The bad weather, including a heavy overnight snowfall, may have contributed to the accident.

Most of the 93 cars in the train were empty bulk transit cars, used for moving agricultural products such as grains. The RCMP report that neither train or truck were transporting any hazardous materials.

&lt;a href="w%3AKyrgyzstan"&gt;Kyrgyz&lt;/a&gt; authorities declared 71 of the 75 seats elected to &lt;a href="w%3Aparliament"&gt;parliament&lt;/a&gt; valid on Tuesday as the opposition cemented control and attempted to maintain order of the country's south, including the cities of &lt;a href="w%3AJalal-Abad%2C%20Kyrgyzstan"&gt;Jalal-Abad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AOsh"&gt;Osh&lt;/a&gt;, by holding joint patrols with local policeman.

President &lt;a href="w%3AAskar%20Akayev"&gt;Askar Akayev&lt;/a&gt;, saying protests against him were part of an attempted &lt;a href="w%3Acoup"&gt;coup&lt;/a&gt;, claimed "criminal elements connected to the drug mafia" were behind the activities, and "the opposition is directed and funded from outside."

However, the president ruled out declaring a &lt;a href="w%3Astate%20of%20emergency"&gt;state of emergency&lt;/a&gt;, saying he was "fully committed to not taking such measures."

Bazambai Solpuyev, a leader of the opposition, claimed that joint public safety patrols has been set up with local police, and this claim was confimed by a spokesman for the Kyrgyz interior ministry.

Anvar Artykov, head of the opposition-backed Osh provisional authority, declared that president Akayev’s authority was no longer being recognized in the region in a statement broadcast on a local television station. 

Prominent opposition figure Roza Otunbayeva claimed that "people’s power" provisional authorities controlled five of the eight districts of Jalal-Abad Province, all but one district of Osh Province, four districts in &lt;a href="w%3ATalas"&gt;Talas Province&lt;/a&gt;, and one in &lt;a href="w%3ANaryn"&gt;Naryn&lt;/a&gt;.

Law-enforcement bodies in the regions have transferred their allegiance to the provisional authorities, although some policemen were not reporting for work. According to reports, relative calm prevailed throughout opposition-controlled regions.

"We are moving towards control over half the country," Otunbayeva said. "The next goal will be [the capital of] &lt;a href="w%3ABishkek"&gt;Bishkek&lt;/a&gt;."

For the first time since the discovery of planets outside the &lt;a href="w%3Asolar%20system"&gt;solar system&lt;/a&gt;, light from two of the 145 confirmed &lt;a href="w%3Aextrasolar%20planet"&gt;extrasolar planets&lt;/a&gt; has been directly captured by &lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ASpitzer%20Space%20Telescope"&gt;Spitzer Space Telescope&lt;/a&gt;.

Astronomers Dr. David Charbonneau of the &lt;a href="w%3AHarvard-Smithsonian%20Center%20for%20Astrophysics"&gt;Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics&lt;/a&gt; and Dr. Drake Deming of NASA's &lt;a href="w%3AGoddard%20Space%20Flight%20Center"&gt;Goddard Space Flight Center&lt;/a&gt; (GSFC), working separately on one each of the two planets used a simple technique to gather the &lt;a href="w%3Ainfrared"&gt;infrared&lt;/a&gt; glow that the planetary bodies emit.

The planets, designated HD 209458b and TrES-1, are classified as "hot Jupiter" planets. These types of extrasolar planets orbit closely around their suns, absorbing the starlight and brightly radiating in the infrared wavelengths.

Using the Spitzer telescope, the astronomers first collected and measured the total infrared output from both the stars and planets. The stars alone were again measured when the planets disappeared behind them during their natural orbits. By comparing the differences between the two measurements, the scientist were able to determine how much infrared light each planet emits.

"In visible light, the glare of the star completely overwhelms the glimmer of light reflected by the planet," Charbonneau said. "In infrared, the star-planet contrast is more favorable because the planet emits its own light."

The data obtained indicates the planets are at least 1,340 degrees Fahrenheit, justifying the classification of "hot Jupiter". More observations from Spitzer could provide information about the planets winds and atmospheric compositions.

"Spitzer has provided us with a powerful new tool for learning about the temperatures, atmospheres and orbits of planets hundreds of light-years from Earth," said Dr. Deming.

"It's fantastic," Dr. Charbonneau said. "We've been hunting for this light for almost 10 years, ever since extrasolar planets were first discovered."

Dr. Deming's paper on his findings appears today in &lt;a href="w%3ANature%20%28journal%29"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;'s online publication; Dr. Charbonneau's paper will be published in an upcoming issue of the &lt;a href="w%3AAstrophysical%20journal"&gt;Astrophysical Journal&lt;/a&gt;.

The Spitzer telescope was launched August 25, 2003 and is scheduled to be de-orbited sometime in 2008. Spitzer was named for Dr. &lt;a href="w%3ALyman%20Spitzer"&gt;Lyman Spitzer&lt;/a&gt; who, in the mid-1940s, first proposed placing telescopes in space.

The &lt;a href="http%3A//cfa-www.harvard.edu/"&gt;Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics&lt;/a&gt; is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
The &lt;a href="http%3A//www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/index.html"&gt;Goddard Space Flight Center&lt;/a&gt; is located in Greenbelt, Maryland.

NASA's &lt;a href="w%3AJPL"&gt;Jet Propulsion Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; manages the Spitzer Space Telescope mission for NASA's &lt;a href="http%3A//science.hq.nasa.gov"&gt;Science Mission Directorate&lt;/a&gt;. Science operations are conducted at the &lt;a href="http%3A//ssc.spitzer.caltech.edu"&gt;Spitzer Science Center&lt;/a&gt;, Pasadena, California.

In an overwhelming vote, the &lt;a href="w%3AIceland"&gt;Icelandic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAl%C3%BEingi"&gt;parliament&lt;/a&gt; voted Tuesday to grant the incarcerated &lt;a href="w%3ABobby%20Fischer"&gt;Bobby Fischer&lt;/a&gt; full citizenship. The former world chess champion has been detained in &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; since July after being arrested for attempting to travel with a revoked &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; passport. Japanese officials have previously said that in such a case Fischer would be sent to Iceland rather than face punishment for violating US economic sanctions by playing a match in &lt;a href="w%3AYugoslavia"&gt;Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;. The US has said it will oppose any such action.

The vote earlier today was 40 in favor, 2 abstentions, 21 absent, and 0 opposed. By a special variation from usual protocol, the measure was pushed through in only 12 minutes. The parliament had earlier declined to grant Fischer full citizenship, offering him instead a special Icelandic passport. This, however, was not enough for Japan, which refused to release him. 
Fischer's case has been long and convoluted. Originally pursued by the US for economic sanction violations, Fischer has been on the run since 1992. In that time he has shown his anti-Semitism by having issued statements praising the &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%2C%202001%20terrorist%20attacks"&gt;September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks&lt;/a&gt; on the United States, and denying that the &lt;a href="w%3AHolocaust"&gt;Holocaust&lt;/a&gt; occurred. For these and other comments the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Chess%20Federation"&gt;United States Chess Federation&lt;/a&gt; revoked his membership. He is now also wanted for tax evasion on some property he owns in the US. He was arrested in Japan in July for travelling with a revoked passport, and has been held since then awaiting deportation. In that time he has tried to avoid being deported by doing such things as revoking his US citizenship and marrying a Japanese woman.

<h1>Australian Govt to lessen numbers of immigrants detained indefinitely</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Australian%20Govt%20to%20lessen%20numbers%20of%20immigrants%20detained%20indefinitely&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AGovernment%20of%20Australia"&gt;Australian Government&lt;/a&gt; today announced terms of a new class of visa which is aimed at reducing the number of &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20immigration%20detention%20facilities"&gt;immigration detainees&lt;/a&gt; locked up indefinitely, after years of criticism by human rights watchdogs.

The new Return Pending Bridging Visa allows for release of detainees held for over three years and who have exhausted all rights for appeal, but who cannot be removed from Australia. In the community they will be provided income support, &lt;a href="w%3AMedicare%20%28Australia%29"&gt;Medicare&lt;/a&gt;, maternity and child benefits, rent assistance and permission to work, and will be required to periodically report to authorities.

Senator &lt;a href="w%3AAmanda%20Vanstone"&gt;Amanda Vanstone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Immigration%20and%20Multicultural%20and%20Indigenous%20Affairs"&gt;Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs&lt;/a&gt; said, "The new Bridging visa will only be granted to a relatively small number of detainees where ... it is not reasonably practicable to achieve removal in the short term and where the detainee undertakes to cooperate fully with removal from Australia, once that becomes practicable."

"The new bridging visa will not be available to detainees with current visa applications, or who are challenging decisions, either through review or courts," the Minister said.

"The new bridging visa category does not apply to failed asylum seekers on Nauru. Management of that caseload remains completely separate from onshore cases." 

And the visa applies only at the Minister's discretion.

A recent High Court decision has left it in the Government's hands to resolve the issue of indefinite detention, maintaining that under the law there was nothing to prevent immigrants who could not be sent to another country and are not accepted by the Australian Government, from being imprisoned forever.

The change is thought to allow release of up to 100 detainees currently held, although it is not a blanket release for all detainees held over three years, for example the longest-serving detainee, Peter Qasim who has been held for seven years, will not be eligible.

Ms Vanstone claims Mr Qasim has not co-operated with the department's attempts to establish his identity. India will only take him if it can be proven that he is Indian - and without any evidence available except his language, he has been unable to return. But according to Ms Vanstone, all it requires is "further co-operation from Mr Qasim" - therefore he remains in detention.

Qasim wrote in an open letter in September: “I have asked 80 countries to take me but all have refused. I have committed no crime but I have a life sentence. Please give me freedom. I would work hard with a grateful heart. But I cannot live imprisoned forever without hope.”

The &lt;a href="w%3AMinuteman%20Bikeway"&gt;Minuteman bike path&lt;/a&gt;, which runs 12 miles from &lt;a href="w%3ACambridge%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Cambridge&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3ABedford%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Bedford, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;, is now passable by bike through Arlington, after what the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Weather%20Service"&gt;National Weather Service&lt;/a&gt; has called the fourth snowiest winter in &lt;a href="w%3ABoston"&gt;Boston's&lt;/a&gt; recorded history. The path has been covered in snow and ice since the &lt;a href="w%3ABlizzard%20of%202005"&gt;Blizzard of 2005&lt;/a&gt; covered it in late January.

The stretch of the path that crosses Lexington and Bedford is marginally rideable, particularly between Lexington Center and the bridge over &lt;a href="w%3AInterstate%20495%20%28Massachusetts%29"&gt;Route 495&lt;/a&gt;, according to a sortie undertaken by Wikinews writer . The first large patch of snow occurs just past the four-mile marker, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.traderjoes.com/locations/map/505.asp"&gt;near Trader Joe's in Arlington&lt;/a&gt;.

The path is not plowed in Arlington, Lexington, or Bedford, though the city of Cambridge plows a short section near the southeastern terminus of the path at the &lt;a href="w%3AAlewife%20%28MBTA%20station%29"&gt;Alewife subway station&lt;/a&gt;. In the winter, the path can be a "scenic trail for cross-country skiing," according to the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.minutemanbikeway.org"&gt;Friends of the Minuteman Bikeway&lt;/a&gt; website.

The bike path runs in the right-of-way once accorded to the &lt;a href="w%3ABoston%20and%20Maine%20Corporation"&gt;Boston and Maine railroad&lt;/a&gt;. The conversion from abandoned railway to bike path occurred from 1991 to 1993. The path is named for its similarity to the route followed by &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Revere"&gt;Paul Revere&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AWilliam%20Dawes"&gt;William Dawes&lt;/a&gt; on their rides to warn the &lt;a href="w%3AMinutemen"&gt;Minutemen&lt;/a&gt; of Lexington about the impending arrival of &lt;a href="w%3ABritish"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; soldiers on April 19, 1775.

&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n magazine ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Bulletin"&gt;The Bulletin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ has offered a reward of AU$1.25 million for conclusive proof that the legendary &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThylacine"&gt;Tasmanian Tiger, or Thylacine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , is still alive.

Says The Bulletin, "A live, uninjured animal must be produced. All government regulations and provisions must be adhered to. A panel of eminent experts chosen by us will have the final say - along with conclusive DNA testing."

Although the last confirmed wild Thylacine sighting was in 1932, and the last captive, named Benjamin, died in the Beaumaris Zoo in Hobart on September 6, 1936, the legend has lived on, with occasional claimed sightings both in &lt;a href="Tasmania"&gt;Tasmania&lt;/a&gt;, and on mainland Australia.

As recently as February of this year, a &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; tourist claimed to have taken photographs of the creature near Lake St Clair in Tasmania. According to The Bulletin, over the past 70 years there have been more than 4000 claimed sightings, but not a single verifiable artifact of hard evidence.

Appearing like a large, striped dog, the thylacine was in fact a marsupial, with a pouch like a kangaroo or koala. Present on the Australian continent for tens of thousands of years, persecution by farmers, government-funded bounty hunters and, in the final years, collectors for overseas museums saw the remnant Tasmanian population wiped out.

Nick Mooney, a wildlife biologist with the Department of Primary Industries, Water and Environment, investigates 150 claims of sightings each year. He told The Bulletin he was open-minded to the possibility of the thylacine's survival, "But if I had to make a call, I'd put money on them not being out there."

The reward offer marks the 125th year of publication of The Bulletin magazine.

On Thursday, March 17, &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; announced the launch of &lt;a href="http%3A//code.google.com"&gt;code.google.com&lt;/a&gt;, a new website for its &lt;a href="w%3Aopen%20source"&gt;open-source&lt;/a&gt; software (also known as "code") and &lt;a href="w%3AAPI"&gt;APIs&lt;/a&gt;, for use by external developers. This launch is the first significant contribution Google has made to the open-source community. The release was announced at the end of the O'Reilly Emerging Technology Conference in &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Diego"&gt;San Diego&lt;/a&gt;.

Google's announcement comes two weeks after &lt;a href="w%3AYahoo"&gt;Yahoo&lt;/a&gt; announced its own &lt;a href="http%3A//developer.yahoo.net"&gt;Developers Program&lt;/a&gt;, offering access to a new collection of its APIs, at the Search Engine Strategies 2005 Conference &amp; Expo in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;. Chris DiBona, Google's Open Source Program Manager, spoke about the release, emphasizing their desire to feature good programs that were being developed using their APIs. Two &lt;a href="w%3AXML"&gt;XML&lt;/a&gt; feeds are currently offered on the site, one for general updates to code hosted there, and another for changes to the weekly featured content.

The initial &lt;a href="http%3A//code.google.com/projects.html"&gt;software projects&lt;/a&gt; provided on the Google site are narrowly focused, consisting of tools for debugging and compiling in two computer languages, &lt;a href="w%3AC%20plus%20plus"&gt;C++&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APython"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt;, particularly when handling &lt;a href="w%3AThread%20%28computer%20science%29"&gt;multi-threaded&lt;/a&gt; code. Google says this is in part to get feedback from a particular audience, before expanding the scope of the project.

These tools are all available under the &lt;a href="w%3ABSD"&gt;BSD&lt;/a&gt; open-source license, though the site's &lt;a href="w%3AFAQ"&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt; notes that it is not tied to any particular license, and in the future is likely to include code released under a variety of free licenses. Google has said that it is developing this site, in part, in the hopes that it can use some of the resulting code in the future.

&lt;a href="w%3AMobile%20phone"&gt;Mobile phone&lt;/a&gt; operating software maker &lt;a href="w%3ASymbian%20%28company%29"&gt;Symbian&lt;/a&gt; is licensing the &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; ActiveSync technology in a move that surprised analysts. The license would allow Symbian to develop a plug-in for mobile phones to let users check email that is served by &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20Exchange%20Server"&gt;Microsoft Exchange Server&lt;/a&gt; mail system.

Symbian was formed in 1998 by Ericsson, Nokia, Motorola and Psion in a collaborative desire to counter Microsoft's emerging market power in operating systems for handheld devices. While Microsoft now provides the &lt;a href="w%3AWindows%20Mobile"&gt;Windows Mobile&lt;/a&gt; software for mobile phones, it has not attained significant market penetration. At the same time, in part through the increased popularity of &lt;a href="w%3AResearch%20in%20Motion"&gt;Research in Motion's&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABlackBerry"&gt;BlackBerry&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ mobile email device, users have come to expect their mobile phones to synchronize email with various mail servers &amp;mdash; including Exchange Server.

Symbian appears to be sensitive to the appearance of collaborating with the very competitor that spurred their creation. Symbian's press release emphasized that the licensing of the technology introduces just one of the many methods the Symbian software communicates with email servers. The spokesperson for the company, Peter Bancroft, was also on the defensive: "Microsoft isn't a monolithic company" he said, referring to the fact that Exchange Server and Windows Mobile are created by two different divisions of Microsoft.

Shares of Research in Motion dropped on the news.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=UN%20Reform%3A%20China%2C%20South%20Korea%20question%20seat%20for%20Japan%20on%20Security%20Council&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A &lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;n official expressed doubts over &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUN%20Secretary-General"&gt;Secretary-General&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="Kofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt;'s apparent support for a permanent &lt;a href="UN%20Security%20Council"&gt;Security Council&lt;/a&gt; seat for &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, and attention has been drawn to widespread mistrust of Japan by &lt;a href="People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; although the Chinese government has not commented directly against Japan.

Asked to comment on Annan supporting Japan gaining the seat, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Liu Jianchao said, "I think reform of the UN Security Council should have its eyes on increasing work efficiency ... and at the same increasing the representation of developing countries."

Four hundred-thousand Chinese have signed an on-line petition opposing Japan's bid, and a poll last year put opposition within China at 95 percent. Resentment still runs high after Japan's invasion of China from 1931 to 1945 led to death or injury of up to 35 million Chinese, and sexual slavery of tens- to hundreds-of-thousands of women in mainland Asia.

The UN reforms currently being discussed are the largest changes since the body's formation 60 years ago.

Last year, Japan, &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Brazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; formed a lobby group supporting each other in bids for seats on the influential Security Council. But &lt;a href="North%20Korea"&gt;North&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt; oppose Japan gaining a seat, &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; opposes Germany, &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; opposes India, and &lt;a href="Mexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Argentina"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt; oppose Brazil.

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="UK"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, and China are permanent members of the council, with the other 10 seats filled by other countries, selected from regional groups for two-year terms.

Three people are dead and five are injured after an explosion tore through a shopping center near the port of Jounie, 20 kilometres north of &lt;a href="w%3ABeirut"&gt;Beirut&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;. The 45-pound bomb, which was placed under a stairwell, exploded around 1:30am local time (0330 UTC).

Police say they believe the bomb was placed there just before the center closed.

The blast caused serious damage to the shopping center, breaking windows, causing false ceilings to collapse, and pillars to warp within a radius of several hundred meters.

A bill passed by &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AParliament"&gt;Parliament&lt;/a&gt; put an end to the manufacture of many cheap &lt;a href="w%3AGeneric%20drug"&gt;generic drugs&lt;/a&gt; copied from products protected by foreign company &lt;a href="w%3APatent"&gt;patents&lt;/a&gt;. A Patents Amendment Bill (2005) has been condemned by &lt;a href="w%3AForeign%20aid"&gt;foreign aid&lt;/a&gt; groups who expect a significant rise in drug costs as a result of the bill.

Drug compounds in India were previously not protected by patents, meaning that research and developement costs borne by the originating manufacturers were avoided by generic drug producers. The new bill "will move India toward the patent mainstream and support and encourage innovation and investment in research and development in India," said Ranjit Sahani, managing director of &lt;a href="w%3ANovartis"&gt;Novartis&lt;/a&gt; India.

As the world's fourth-largest manufacturer of drugs by volume, the &lt;a href="w%3APharmacology"&gt;pharmaceutical&lt;/a&gt; industry in India is valued at US$5 billion - but ranks as only 13th by value, reflecting the low costs to consumers of the products. "Because India is one of the world's biggest producers of generic drugs, this law will have a severe knock-on effect on many developing countries which depend on imported generic drugs from India," said Samar Verma, regional policy adviser at &lt;a href="w%3AOxfam"&gt;Oxfam&lt;/a&gt; International.

Around half of African, Asian and Latin American &lt;a href="w%3AHIV"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt; patients needing &lt;a href="w%3AAntiretroviral%20drug"&gt;anti-retroviral drugs&lt;/a&gt; rely on low-cost drugs from India, which are sold at one twentieth the price of similar drugs produced in the West.

More than 90 per cent of drugs listed as essentials in India are either unpatented or expired. Drugs patented before 1995 -- when the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Trade%20Organization"&gt;World Trade Organization&lt;/a&gt; [WTO] set a 10 year deadline to enact protection -- will not be eligible under the bill.

Some degree of protection was mandated by WTO in order for India to have greater access to international markets. Opposers of the bill say it goes too far. 

The &lt;a href="w%3AAgreement%20on%20Trade-Related%20Aspects%20of%20Intellectual%20Property%20Rights"&gt;Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights&lt;/a&gt; [TRIPS], under WTO, allows developing countries to not provide patent protection for uses of known drugs, new dosages and formulations, or combinations of known drugs.

On behalf of the &lt;a href="w%3AFDA"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Marshals%20Service"&gt;U.S. Federal marshals&lt;/a&gt; have begun seizing beds which have killed at least seven patients out of about 30 who had become trapped by the products. Three versions of the bed were found to be "dangerous to health" by the FDA, with the specific danger of, "placing patients at an increased risk of entrapment and asphyxiation."

The model numbers of the faulty beds include the ♡❤Vail 500, 1000, and 2000 Enclosed Bed Systems♡❤. The beds are made by &lt;a href="w%3AToledo%2C%20Ohio"&gt;Toledo, Ohio&lt;/a&gt;-based Vail Products, Inc.

In a government press release, the FDA pointed out that Vail had failed to heed two previous warnings issued by the agency, asking the company to comply with regulations regarding proper labeling and usage directions. The FDA also said that Vail had failed to supply required documentation to the agency to comply with the ♡❤Medical Device Reporting♡❤ and ♡❤Reports of Corrections and Removals♡❤ regulations.

At the time this story was filed, the Vail web site made no mention of today's FDA announcement. Toledo's ♡❤WTOL News 11♡❤ reported that, "Company officials say their beds aren't dangerous if used properly." The Vail corporate web site claims that the beds allow, "the patient to move about freely within a safe, padded environment" and "control wandering."

The FDA is the U.S. agency responsible for regulating food, drugs, medical devices, and cosmetics.

More than 100 people are dead in &lt;a href="w%3AUige%20Province"&gt;Uige province&lt;/a&gt; in northern &lt;a href="w%3AAngola"&gt;Angola&lt;/a&gt;, due to a virus related to the &lt;a href="w%3AEbola"&gt;Ebola virus&lt;/a&gt;, known as the &lt;a href="w%3AMarburg%20virus"&gt;Marburg virus&lt;/a&gt;, which causes death by bleeding and is both "very virulent" and "very contagious". A longer incubation period without symptoms than that of the Ebola virus has authorities keeping a watchful eye for the disease migrating.

"This is a possibility. The incubation period is 21 days so we must reinforce the surveillance in neighbouring provinces and especially in Luanda," Vice Minister for Health Jose Van Dunem told ♡❤Reuters♡❤.

The virus is transmitted by bodily fluids, including &lt;a href="w%3Asaliva"&gt;saliva&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the victims have been children under five. There is no cure, but the 70 percent survival rate is somewhat better than the worst form of Ebola, which has a survival rate of only 10 percent.

Symptoms of Marburg include high fever, headaches, nausea with vomiting, and &lt;a href="w%3ADiarrhea"&gt;diarrhea&lt;/a&gt; accompanied by blood.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco%2C%20California"&gt;San Francisco, California&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — &lt;a href="w%3ASarah%20Jessica%20Parker"&gt;Sarah Jessica Parker&lt;/a&gt; has lost her fashion cache with The U.S. clothier said it was dropping the star of its current and ubiquitous ♡❤I Enjoy Being a Girl♡❤ television advertising campaign and buying out her contract.

Parker who turns 40 Friday and is best known for her role as the &lt;a href="w%3AManolo%20Blahnik"&gt;Manolo Blahnik&lt;/a&gt; shoe-crazed Carrie Bradshaw on the HBO comedy, ♡❤,♡❤ was ousted after less than one year of a multi-year contract. She signed a three-year $38 million deal with the San Francisco-based retailer in mid-2004 and has only appeared in ads for the company since the 2004 holiday season.

"While Gap will always seek partnerships with celebrities, musicians and rising stars, we don't have any future plans to sign a single person to a multi-season deal like the unique and special relationship we enjoyed with Sarah Jessica," Gap said in a statement Monday, stopping short of calling the ad campaign a failure. One such rising star slated to appear in the upcoming summer white denim promotion for Gap is 17-year-old &lt;a href="w%3AGrammy%20Awards"&gt;Grammy&lt;/a&gt;-nominated British singer &lt;a href="w%3AJoss%20Stone"&gt;Joss Stone&lt;/a&gt;. 

Although Gap would not say its Parker ad campaign was less than successful, the same can not be said for stock market pundits. "If you're like me, and have gotten a little sick of hearing Sarah Jessica Parker sing about how much she likes being a girl on those Gap commercials," Alyce Lomax, a stock market commentator for The Motley Fool web site, said. "Investors who have been watching this stock know that despite the best efforts of Ms. Parker and the creative teams that came up with the ads, Gap's quarterly fashion sense continues to be, well, flattish ... in the meantime, other, hotter retailers have stolen the show."

In a statement to reporters, Parker called the spilt with Gap a mutual decision, and walks away $38 million richer and recently signed a 2-year deal with former employer HBO to develop future programming for the network. Parker is also scheduled to appear in two upcoming comedy films, a movie adaptation of the &lt;a href="w%3AComedy%20Central"&gt;Comedy Central&lt;/a&gt; series, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AStrangers%20with%20Candy"&gt;Strangers with Candy&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, as well as ♡❤The Family Stone♡❤, costarring and &lt;a href="w%3AClaire%20Danes"&gt;Claire Danes&lt;/a&gt;.

Former world &lt;a href="w%3Achess"&gt;chess&lt;/a&gt; champion &lt;a href="w%3ABobby%20Fischer"&gt;Bobby Fischer&lt;/a&gt; will move from &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; to his new home of &lt;a href="w%3AIceland"&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt; despite requests from the &lt;a href="w%3AUSA"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt; for his &lt;a href="w%3ADeporation"&gt;deportation&lt;/a&gt; to the US. Mr Fischer had been held in Japan since last &lt;a href="w%3AJuly%202004"&gt;July&lt;/a&gt; when he was arrested on what US officials claimed was an invalid US passport. He was freed from detention on March 23 after 9 months in confinement.

Mr Fischer is wanted in the USA for violating &lt;a href="w%3AExecutive%20Order"&gt;Executive Order&lt;/a&gt; 12810, signed by then-President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20H.%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George H. W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; in 1992. EO 12810 placed sanctions on the former &lt;a href="w%3AYugoslavia"&gt;Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;, where Mr Fischer played a chess match in &lt;a href="w%3A1992"&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href="w%3ABoris%20Spassky"&gt;Boris Spassky&lt;/a&gt;. If Mr Fischer had been sent to the US, he would have faced a ten year prison term. The U.S. revoked his passport in &lt;a href="w%3A2003"&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt; and Mr Fischer was later arrested at &lt;a href="w%3ANarita%20Airport"&gt;Narita Airport&lt;/a&gt; while trying to leave Japan en route to the &lt;a href="w%3APhilippines"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt;.

Following an appeal by Mr Fischer's supporters, the parliament of Iceland granted Mr Fischer an Icelandic passport on Monday. Mr Fischer won the world championship in &lt;a href="w%3AReykjavik"&gt;Reykjavik&lt;/a&gt;, Iceland in &lt;a href="w%3A1972"&gt;1972&lt;/a&gt;, against Mr Spassky, then of the &lt;a href="w%3ASoviet%20Union"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;, and Mr Fischer remains popular among Icelanders. (Mr Spassky became a &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; citizen in 1978). The 1992 rematch was billed as as being for the "World Championship", although by then most chess fans recognized &lt;a href="w%3AGarry%20Kasparov"&gt;Garry Kasparov&lt;/a&gt; as the world's #1 player.

Iceland's ambassador to Japan, Thordur Oskarsson, said that the US government had sent a message of displeasure to the Icelandic government before its parliament passed the bill allowing for Mr Fischer's citizenship. Mr Oskarsson went on to say that, "Despite the message, the decision was put through Parliament on humanitarian grounds".

The trial against internet file-sharing network &lt;a href="w%3AKazaa"&gt;Kazaa&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, is coming to an end, as closing arguments began today. Kazaa pleaded it could not be held responsible for the copyright infringements perpetrated by its users, as it cannot control how the software is used.

The &lt;a href="w%3Apeer-to-peer"&gt;peer-to-peer&lt;/a&gt; distribution software and its owner, &lt;a href="w%3ASharman%20Networks%20Ltd."&gt;Sharman Networks Ltd.&lt;/a&gt; and its directors were sued by a group of Australian record labels for copyright infringements by the network's estimated 100 million members worldwide. Members of the software share music files with each other, and download up to three billion songs and music files monthly. The music industry claims it has lost millions of dollars in unpaid &lt;a href="w%3ARoyalties"&gt;royalties&lt;/a&gt; as a result.

Lawyer &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Meagher"&gt;Tony Meagher&lt;/a&gt; argued that Sharman is no more responsible for the uses of its software than the designers of the photocopiers and video recorders were responsible for the illegal copying of materials on those machines. The remaining question is whether Kazaa authorises its users to download files illegally.

"We tell these users in our Web site and we tell them in our license that they cannot use this (software) for infringing copyright," Meagher told Judge &lt;a href="w%3AMurray%20Wilcox"&gt;Murray Wilcox&lt;/a&gt;. By consenting to this license by users, Kazaa is exempted from responsibility.

The record industry claims Kazaa not only enables but encourages copyright infringement. Record industry lawyer &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Bannon"&gt;Tony Bannon&lt;/a&gt; argued that as Kazaa collected information from its users through spyware and sold it to advertisers, the company's claim that it had no control over the software was "completely mind boggling."

This is not the first trial against Kazaa, and other programs of its kind. In August last year, Judge &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Wilson"&gt;Stephen Wilson&lt;/a&gt; ruled that the distribution by &lt;a href="w%3AGrokster"&gt;Grokster&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMorpheus"&gt;Morpheus&lt;/a&gt; of peer-to-peer software does not violate U.S. copyright law. Rod Dorman, lead trial council for Sharman Networks in the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt;, said, "As a result of this decision, Sharman Networks will be filing a motion for summary judgement, nearly identical to the successful motions filed by Grokster and Morpheus, and we are confident that Judge Wilson will find that our product, Kazaa, is a lawful product as well." However, the ruling held no precedential effect in the Australian trial, as the principles differed.

Kazaa and the FastTrack protocol are the brainchild of the Scandinavians Niklas Zennström and Janus Friis, and were introduced in March 2001 by their Dutch company Consumer Empowerment. It appeared during the end of the first generation of P2P networks. Napster shut down in July of that year. (&lt;a href="w%3AKazaa"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;)

The trial is expected to wrap up later today. A verdict should be passed within six weeks.

About 200 riot police violently broke up a peaceful, anti-Akayev protest of some 300 to 400 people and arrested 20 to 30 protesters in the capital city of &lt;a href="w%3ABishkek"&gt;Bishkek&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday, just hours after &lt;a href="w%3AAskar%20Akayev"&gt;President Askar Akayev&lt;/a&gt; appointed head of police in the city, Keneshbek Dushebayev, as new interior minister.

"Our primary task is to restore constitutional order in all regions," the new interior minister said. "The law gives us every right to take action, including by using physical force... and firearms."

Akayev has previously stated that he would not resort to force to end protests.

Akayev dismissed Interior Minister Bakirdin Subanbekov and the general prosecutor, Myktybek Abdyldayev, earlier in the day. According to a spokesman for Akayev, Abdil Seghizbayev, the dismissals were for issues relating "to the events in the south and their poor work on preventing those events."

Seghizbayev stated that &lt;a href="w%3ANikolai%20Tanayev"&gt;Prime Minister Nikolai Tanayev&lt;/a&gt; would visit the southern city of &lt;a href="w%3AOsh"&gt;Osh&lt;/a&gt; for negotiations on Thursday, but said there would not be talks with "criminal groups that are controlling the situation there."

Elsewhere in Bishkek, approximately 10,000 people held a pro-government demonstration as riot police guarded key government buildings and main roads were sealed off. Several demonstrators said they had been coerced into taking part. 

"Our classes were cancelled and we were told to be here at the meeting in support of Akayev," a Kyrgyz National University student said.

"We are protesting instead of working now," said an employee of the interior ministry at the rally.

Neighboring &lt;a href="w%3ATajikistan"&gt;Tajikistan&lt;/a&gt; also sealed border crossing points from Kyrgyzstan into the country because of the unrest.

<h1>Harp seal hunt approved by Canada, activists call for boycott of Canadian seafood</h1>
♡❤♡, ♡❤♡ 

&lt;a href="w%3AOttawa"&gt;Ottawa&lt;/a&gt; says it will allow the harvest of 320,000 young seals this year, prompting a backlash from international environmental activists who call for a boycott of the Canadian fisheries products.

The seal hunt is an annual event on the ice floes off the east coast of &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; where the seal nurseries give birth. This year's hunt begins March 29, and lasts for two months.

The government reports the &lt;a href="w%3Aharp%20seal"&gt;harp seal&lt;/a&gt; population is large and healthy. "The harp seal herd - the most important seal herd for this industry - is estimated at around five million animals, nearly the highest level ever recorded, and almost triple what it was in the 1970s," a Department of Fisheries and Oceans statement said. Large scale hunts will continue to be allowed until the harp seal population drops below four million.

Environmental activists protest and observe the hunt annually, but this year's larger number of seals has brought a bigger response. Observers are already in the hunt area, and officials said if too many show up they will be prevented from interfering with the hunt. The annual protests, and the publication of photos of the hunt, are a public relations problem for Canada.

Protests were held in 50 cities around the world last week, and activists say they would press consumers and restaurants to avoid Canadian fish for at least the duration of the hunt.

"We're going to be encouraging consumers to enter into dialogue with their grocery stores and their restaurants and say 'Please don't serve Canadian seafood' or 'I won't buy Canadian seafood until this hunt is over'," said Pat Ragan of the &lt;a href="w%3AHumane%20Society"&gt;Humane Society of the United States&lt;/a&gt; [HSUS] to ♡❤Reuters♡❤.

The International Fund for Animal Welfare sponsored two independent veterinary teams to observe the 2001 hunt which concluded the animals are often (42% of the time) killed in an inhumane manner and not in accordance with Canada's own laws.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACambridge%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Cambridge, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
Construction of two condominium buildings and a five-acre park began on March 21, in East Cambridge, Massachusetts. The buildings and park are part of the 45-acre Northpoint development, which will take 15 years and more than $2bn to complete, according to the ♡❤Boston Globe♡❤. The buildings, designated as "Building S" and "Building T" by the planners of the project, Spaulding &amp; Slye Colliers, have been designed by local architectural firm Childs Bertman Tseckares and Architects Alliance from Toronto. Buildings S and T are the first of an eventual 20 buildings planned at the site.

The development will fill what used to be a railroad yard for the Guilford Rail System, a subsidiary of Guilford Transportation Industries. According to Hoovers.com, Guilford is controlled by Timothy Mellon, heir to the Mellon banking fortune. Guilford Rail Systems has its headquarters in North Billerica and owns 1600 miles of railroad throughout New England. The tracks in the Northpoint plot have been removed, though Boston subway's Lechmere station remains within walking distance of the site, along with parts of Boston and Cambridge. The site is bordered by Route 93 on its eastern side, Monsignor O'Brien Highway to the west, and the Gilmore Bridge to the south.

The landscape architecture of the park is provided by Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates, a landscape architecture firm on Concord Avenue in Cambridge. The firm's principal teaches in Harvard's Graduate School of Design. MVVA is also completing the landscape for Harvard's Northwest Science Building.

Last night, &lt;a href="CNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAnderson%20Cooper"&gt;Anderson Cooper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; played a chilling police audio tape of a 1991 confession made by the accused killer of 9-year-old &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJessica%20Lunsford"&gt;Jessica Lunsford&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . On the tape, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Couey"&gt;John E. Couey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is heard admitting to molesting a young girl in her own backyard. For the crime he was subsequently charged, convicted and imprisoned for 2 years. 

An accompanying written report by the officer who took the taped confession says; "Couey admitted that this was not the first child he had ever touched, however, this is the first time he was caught." The officer continues, "Couey admitted to molesting his wife's daughter, however, she agreed not to report the incident if he left the house and gave her a divorce, which he did." CNN was unable to locate Couey's former wife.

The revelation calls into question the way Couey has been dealt with by officials over the years. He spoke on the 1991 tape about how he "needs help" and "wants help".

Mary Doyle, a Citrus County probation official, said Monday that if they had known Couey was a registered sex offender, they may have been able to keep him away from Jessica Lunsford. Florida Courts do not provide probation workers with criminal backgrounds of their probationers, even in the case of registered sexual offenders like Couey, Doyle said. With that information they might have tried harder to locate him when he failed to report in with probation officials last November. When detectives did finally catch up with him, they learned he had been living across the road from Jessica.

The leaders discussed cooperation in the areas of border security, trade, and immigration, signing an accord called the "Security and Prosperity Partnership of &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20America"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt;."

"In a rapidly changing world, we must develop new avenues of cooperation that will make our open societies safer and more secure, our businesses more competitive, and our economies more resilient," read a joint statement released by the three leaders.

The agreement calls for greater sharing of intelligence and the strengthening of infrastructure security. It also seeks to develop a common system for screening travellers, and promotes collaboration in the sectors of transportation, energy, technology, and financial services.

Each nation will set up ministerial-level working groups that will "set specific, measurable, and achievable goals and implementation dates" and "identify concrete steps the governments can take to achieve these goals," according to a &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; press release. The initial reports are due within 90 days.

President Bush, while not offering specific details, also said that he would "continue to push for reasonable, common-sense immigration policy with the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Congress"&gt;United States Congress&lt;/a&gt;."

A huge explosion at the third-largest oil refinery in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; killed at least 14 workers and injured more than 100 others at about 1:30 p.m. local time (19:30 UTC) on Wednesday, in &lt;a href="w%3ATexas%20City%2C%20Texas"&gt;Texas City, Texas&lt;/a&gt;.

The blast caused extensive damage to the &lt;a href="w%3ABP"&gt;BP&lt;/a&gt; facility, left a large crater in the ground, and flung chunks of burnt metal onto cars and trucks in the employee parking lot. Windows and lights shattered in homes and other buildings miles from the blast location. A massive cloud of black smoke hovered over the sky.

"It was real scary," refinery worker Charles Gregory told the ♡❤Associated Press♡❤. "Have you ever hear the thunder real loud? It was like 10 times that," he said.

Authorities do ♡❤♡not♡❤♡ suspect that the explosion was caused by &lt;a href="w%3Aterrorism"&gt;terrorism&lt;/a&gt;, but have not yet determined the cause of the blast. Federal investigators have been sent to the site, according to Daniel Horowitz, the director of public affairs for the US Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board.

"We have no reason to believe this was anything caused by an outside agent," said BP spokesman Hugh Depland.

The 1,200-acre facility employs 1,800 workers, and outputs three percent of the oil supply for the United States (almost half a million barrels a day). The western side of the facility directly affected by the blast makes high-grade fuel.

Firefighters worked for over two hours to fight blazes caused by the explosion.

Company officials have not yet announced how long production will be suspended at the refinery. Gasoline futures began trading higher at an all-time peak of $1.60 a gallon during after-hours trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, but retreated to $1.58 later in the evening.

"It's a sad day for BP," said site director Don Parus.

Texas City last suffered a major accident in April 1947, when a ship filled with ammonium nitrate exploded, killing about a third of the town's population, and injuring about 5,000 others.

<h1>Woman finds human finger in bowl of chili at Wendy's restaurant</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Woman%20finds%20human%20finger%20in%20bowl%20of%20chili%20at%20Wendy%27s%20restaurant&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Jose%2C%20California"&gt;San Jose, California&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; A woman eating a bowl of &lt;a href="w%3AChili%20con%20carne"&gt;chili&lt;/a&gt; at a &lt;a href="w%3AWendy%27s"&gt;Wendy's&lt;/a&gt; restaurant bit into a chewy bit that turned out to be a human finger. She immediately spat it out, warned other patrons to stop eating, and upon recognizing the object as a finger, vomited.

"I'm more of a &lt;a href="w%3ACarl%27s%20Jr."&gt;Carl's Jr.&lt;/a&gt; person," the 39-year-old &lt;a href="w%3ALas%20Vegas"&gt;Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt; woman, Anna Ayala, told ♡❤Knight Ridder♡❤. She said this incident was her first visit to a Wendy's restaurant. Ayala described how she found the finger, "Suddenly something crunchy was in my mouth," she continued, "and I spit it out."

According to Devina Cordero, 20, after Ayala found the finger, she ran up to her and Cordero's boyfriend and said, "Don't eat it! Look, there's a human finger in our chili."

"We went up to the counter and they told us it was a vegetable," Cordero continued. "The people from Wendy's were poking it with a spoon."

The restaurant is located at &lt;a href="http%3A//maps.yahoo.com/maps_result%3Fed%3DD4i2bep_0TovidHDYtqrQHRlDHOuccH7Mb1zXxmY%26amp%3Bcsz%3DSan%2BJose%252C%2BCA%26amp%3Bcountry%3Dus%26amp%3Bnew%3D1%26amp%3Bname%3D%26amp%3Bqty%3D"&gt;1405 Monterey Highway&lt;/a&gt;, just south of downtown San Jose.
Wikinews reporter drove his car up to the drive-thru menu and found that chili was still on the menu, at a price of US$1.19 for a small serving. He also witnessed workers unloading supplies from a &lt;a href="w%3ASemi-trailer"&gt;semi-trailer truck&lt;/a&gt; in the restaurant's parking lot, and carting them into the back door of the establishment.

According to Ben Gale, director of environmental health for &lt;a href="w%3ASanta%20Clara%20County"&gt;Santa Clara County&lt;/a&gt;, the finger did not come from any of the employees at the restaurant. "We asked everybody to show us they have 10 fingers and everything is OK there," he said. The found portion of the finger likely belonged to a woman because of its long and manicured fingernail, also found in the food.

Officials seized the food supply at the restaurant and are tracing it back to the manufacturer, where they believe the finger may have gotten mixed in with the raw ingredients used to prepare the chili. The restaurant's operators were later permitted to re-open after preparing new chili prepared from fresh ingredients.
As this story was filed, there was no mention of the incident on the Wendy's corporate web site. Wendy's issued a statement through a spokesman.

"Food safety is of utmost importance to us," said Wendy's spokesman Joe Desmond. He referred to the incident as an "unsubstantiated claim."

"We are cooperating fully with the local police and health departments with their investigation. It's important not to jump to conclusions. Here at Wendy's we plan to do right by our customers," Desmond said.

According to county health officials, the unfortunate woman who bit into the finger is doing fine, despite her initial reaction. Officials also noted that the finger would have been cooked at a high enough temperature to destroy any viruses.

The Santa Clara county medical examiner reported that the finger had a solid fingerprint, although investigators did not say if a search of fingerprint databases would be performed to find the owner of the finger.

&lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraqi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; forces raided a training camp in a remote, rural region 160 kilometers north of &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday, killing 85 &lt;a href="w%3AIraqi%20resistance"&gt;insurgents&lt;/a&gt;. Seven Iraqi commandos were killed in the raid and six were injured, according to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20armed%20forces"&gt;US military&lt;/a&gt;.

In addition to placing the insurgent death toll at 85, the &lt;a href="w%3AGovernment%20of%20Iraq"&gt;Iraqi government&lt;/a&gt; also said that between 500 and 700 Iraqi commandos took part in the raid.

After encountering heavy fire from an estimated 100 insurgents as they approached the camp, the Iraqi commandos called in support from the American 42nd Infantry Division, which sent in ground troops and attack helicopters. The battle began at approximately 11a.m. local time (0800 UTC) and lasted seven hours.

The training camp, located in a remote region near &lt;a href="w%3ATharthar"&gt;Lake Tharthar&lt;/a&gt;, which is adjacent to the predominantly &lt;a href="w%3ASunni"&gt;Sunni&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAnbar"&gt;Anbar&lt;/a&gt; and Salahuddin provinces, is the largest guerilla training camp that has been discovered in the war so far, according to Iraqi officials.

The insurgents had planned to attack the city of &lt;a href="w%3ASamarra"&gt;Samarra&lt;/a&gt;, located 55 kilometers east of the lake, with a large number of car bombs, according to the Iraqi Interior Ministry.

Iraqi officials claimed that most of the insurgents came from &lt;a href="w%3AArab"&gt;Arab&lt;/a&gt; countries, though men from the &lt;a href="w%3APhilippines"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt; were also among the deceased insurgents. They also claimed to have captured one &lt;a href="w%3AAlgeria"&gt;Algerian&lt;/a&gt;.

"The Arab countries are sending fighters into Iraq because they want to destroy our democratic movement," said General Rashid Flaiyeh, head of Iraqi police in Salahuddin Province, in an interview broadcast on state-run television network &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Iraqiya"&gt;Al Iraqiya&lt;/a&gt;.

A company named &lt;a href="w%3ANumenta"&gt;Numenta&lt;/a&gt; was founded today by &lt;a href="w%3AJeff%20Hawkins"&gt;Jeff Hawkins&lt;/a&gt;, founder of &lt;a href="w%3Ahandheld%20computer"&gt;handheld computer&lt;/a&gt; company &lt;a href="w%3ApalmOne"&gt;palmOne&lt;/a&gt;, and his longtime partner &lt;a href="w%3ADonna%20Dubinsky"&gt;Donna Dubinsky&lt;/a&gt;. The company is focused on the creation of technology to emulate the workings of the &lt;a href="w%3Ahuman%20brain"&gt;human brain&lt;/a&gt;. They are based in &lt;a href="w%3AMenlo%20Park"&gt;Menlo Park&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;. 

Hawkins has been intrigued by the faculties of the human brain for years. In &lt;a href="w%3A2002"&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt;, he founded the &lt;a href="w%3ARedwood%20Neuroscience%20Institute"&gt;Redwood Neuroscience Institute&lt;/a&gt;. His theories on the working of the brain were explained in "On Intelligence: How a New Understanding of the Brain Will Lead to the Creation of Truly Intelligent Machines," co-written with &lt;a href="w%3ASandra%20Blakeslee"&gt;Sandra Blakeslee&lt;/a&gt;. Hawkins' official recognition with the company will only be as 'founder', as the company will be led by Dubinsky. Hawkins will continue as chief technical officer of palmOne and remain at Redwood.

The company will not charge fees for its products during the first few years in order to encourage further development of the technology and build up a development community. The annual budget of more than &lt;a href="w%3AUSD"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;1 million will be paid by Hawkins and Dubinsky, who have raised an undisclosed amount from a handful of friends and associates.

Hawkins and third co-founder of Numenta, Dileep George, have been working on developing the technology since 2003, and have devised an example piece of &lt;a href="w%3Asoftware"&gt;software&lt;/a&gt;. Data is put into the program by showing it 90 different pictures. The software can then recognise any of the 90 objects, even when drawn incomplete or in bad quality. Pattern matching is still difficult for today's &lt;a href="w%3Ahardware"&gt;hardware&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Asoftware"&gt;software&lt;/a&gt; technologies. If outfitted with a camera, a sophisticated pattern matching system could be used by law enforcement to recognise the faces of wanted criminals in crowds.

Other notable attempts at creating more powerful computer systems include &lt;a href="w%3AArtificial%20intelligence"&gt;Artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt;, which started in the 1950s and took off in the mid 1980s and led to disappointment due to high expectations, and the &lt;a href="w%3AQuantum%20Computer"&gt;Quantum Computer&lt;/a&gt;, both fields are still in active development.

Jeff Hawkins and Dileep George will be publishing a paper on &lt;a href="http%3A//www.stanford.edu/~dil/invariance/Download/GeorgeHawkinsIJCNN05.pdf"&gt;'A Hierarchical Bayesian Model of Invariant Pattern Recognition in the Visual Cortex'&lt;/a&gt; at an upcoming neural networks conference.

The summit rejected &lt;a href="Jordan"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt;'s plan to normalise relations with Israel by instead sticking to the 2002 peace plan. That plan promised to normalise relations only after an Israeli withdrawal from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Athe%20occupied%20territories"&gt;occupied territories&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the creation of a &lt;a href="Palestine"&gt;Palestinian&lt;/a&gt; state, and the settlement of Palestinian refugees.

The summit announced the creation of an Arab Parliament to be based in the &lt;a href="Syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;n capital of &lt;a href="Damascus"&gt;Damascus&lt;/a&gt;. It will contain four members from each of the 22 Arab League states.

&lt;a href="Libya"&gt;Libya&lt;/a&gt;n leader &lt;a href="Muammar%20Gadhafi"&gt;Muammar Gadhafi&lt;/a&gt;, the longest serving Arab leader at the meeting, caused tensions by telling the Palestinian delegation he thought both "Palestinians and Israelis are stupid." He also reiterated his call for a single state solution, saying "the solution I think is to have a single state. We cannot have two states." He also addressed terrorism, claiming it was the result of "oppression, injustice, arrogance, insults, contempt and the humiliation of this [Arab] nation."

<h1>New figures released on Irish income distribution</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=New%20figures%20released%20on%20Irish%20income%20distribution&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

New figures released yesterday by the &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Statistics%20Office"&gt;Central Statistics Office of Ireland&lt;/a&gt; confirmed that &lt;a href="w%3ADublin"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt; has the highest level of &lt;a href="w%3Adisposable%20income"&gt;disposable income&lt;/a&gt; per person in the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20of%20Ireland"&gt;Republic of Ireland&lt;/a&gt; whilst &lt;a href="w%3ACavan"&gt;Cavan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADonegal"&gt;Donegal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AKerry"&gt;Kerry&lt;/a&gt; have the lowest figures.

Taking 100% to be the national average, Dublin's disposable income per person was 13.4% above the national average, compared to the bottom three counties which were up to 16.5% below the national average.

According to the figures, only four counties in the country were above the average - Dublin, &lt;a href="w%3AKildare"&gt;Kildare&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AWicklow"&gt;Wicklow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALimerick"&gt;Limerick&lt;/a&gt;. Six counties were less than 90% of the national average.

The figures indicate that Southern and Eastern regions have the highest levels of disposable income in the country. The Western, Border, Midland and Northern regions have the lowest levels.

The figures - althought the latest available - were put together in &lt;a href="w%3A2002"&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt;. It is likely the situation has changed somewhat since then.

<h1>Canada set to rule on U.S. Army refugee</h1>
♡❤♡, ♡❤♡ 

The Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada is scheduled to release its decision on &lt;a href="w%3AJeremy%20Hinzman"&gt;Jeremy Hinzman's&lt;/a&gt; application for political refugee status.

The case is being closely watched as it will directly affect at least 8, and possibly more, U.S. military deserters in Canada, and could further strain relations between Washington, D.C. and &lt;a href="w%3AOttawa"&gt;Ottawa&lt;/a&gt;.

Hinzman's application was heard at a three-day immigration hearing in December. At the hearing he argued that he fled to &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; to avoid military service in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; in an illegal war, possibly making his participation a war crime under the &lt;a href="w%3ANuremberg%20Trials"&gt;Nuremberg tribunals&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Army"&gt;U.S. Army&lt;/a&gt; has declared Hinzman "Absent Without Leave" (&lt;a href="w%3AAWOL"&gt;AWOL&lt;/a&gt;), and said he would face charges as a deserter which include the possibility of the death penalty.

"My life isn't that significant, but it's also not so worthless to be killed or go kill innocent people," said Hinzman.

Canada has accepted refugees in the past fleeing compulsory military service, but as Hinzman volunteered to serve this case is breaking new ground.

Hinzman is a practicing &lt;a href="w%3ABuddhism"&gt;Buddhist&lt;/a&gt;, and applied for &lt;a href="w%3Aconscientious%20objector"&gt;conscientious objector&lt;/a&gt; status in the Army in 2002 before his unit was ordered to &lt;a href="w%3AAfghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;. His application was rejected and he was ordered to ship out to Iraq in late 2003. At that time he and his family fled from his &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Carolina"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; base for Canada (his wife, Nga Nguyen, is also seeking asylum.)

The Immigration and Refugee Board's decision is expected Thursday afternoon on their website, and will not be announced publicly.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOwings%20Mills%2C%20Maryland"&gt;Owings Mills, Maryland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — U.S. pubcaster, &lt;a href="w%3APBS"&gt;PBS&lt;/a&gt; said it was canceling its business magazine and interview program, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWall%20Street%20Week"&gt;Wall $treet Week&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. The last new episode is scheduled to air on June 24.

The program, based in Owings Mills, Maryland, has been on the air continuously for 35 years, becoming one of the longest-running programs in U.S. television history. It had been struggling to regain audience lost after the producers fired long-time host &lt;a href="w%3ALouis%20Rukeyser"&gt;Louis Rukeyser&lt;/a&gt; in 2002 and signed a controversial deal with &lt;a href="w%3ATime%20Warner"&gt;AOL Time Warner&lt;/a&gt; to co produce the show with the editorial staff of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AFortune%20%28magazine%29"&gt;Fortune magazine&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

According to a report in the ♡❤New York Times♡❤, after Rukeyser's dismissal, 22 of the show's regular expert guests vowed never to appear on the program again. Rukeyser was later hired by cable channel &lt;a href="w%3ACNBC"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt;, where he hosted a program that aired in direct competition with ♡❤Wall $treet Week♡❤ in the U.S. eastern time zone until he fell ill in December 2004.

A technology entrepreneur in northeastern &lt;a href="w%3AWashington"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; asked a doctor to implant an &lt;a href="w%3ARFID"&gt;RFID&lt;/a&gt; chip into his hand in order to experiment with the technology. &lt;a href="w%3AAmal%20Graafstra"&gt;Amal Graafstra&lt;/a&gt;, who runs a technology company in &lt;a href="w%3ABellingham%2C%20Washington"&gt;Bellingham, WA&lt;/a&gt;, asked a doctor to place the chip under the skin of his left hand, and posted pictures of the procedure to the photo-sharing site, &lt;a href="w%3AFlickr"&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt;. Graafstra plans to use the chip for keyless entry to his car, home, or as a login for computer systems.

Implanting RFID chips is a relatively old technology. Professor &lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Warwick"&gt;Kevin Warwick&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Reading"&gt;University of Reading&lt;/a&gt;, UK implanted a 23mm RFID chip into his left arm in August 1998. It allowed him to open doors and turn on the lights in a room as he entered. Further European research in the area was recently dealt a blow when the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies made a presentation to the European Union raising privacy concerns over the potential for such chips to be used to track members of the public.

In mid-2004, about 160 &lt;a href="w%3AMexico"&gt;Mexican&lt;/a&gt; officials received RFID implants for security purposes, and scientists in the past have implanted themselves with such chips for research purposes. In October 2004, the U.S. &lt;a href="w%3AFood%20and%20Drug%20Administration"&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; (FDA) approved the implantation of &lt;a href="w%3AVerichip"&gt;Verichip&lt;/a&gt; technology for medical purposes.

An implantable RFID chip is a minuscule capsule containing a microchip and an antenna, all enclosed in glass. The chip that Mr. Graafstra had implanted was 12&lt;a href="w%3Amillimeter"&gt;mm&lt;/a&gt; long and 2mm in diameter &amp;mdash; about the size of a grain of rice. RFID chips work by storing a unique identification number in the microchip. This number can be retrieved by a special RFID reader that is held within close proximity. Graafstra notes that his chip can be read from a distance of about 2 inches (5&lt;a href="w%3Acm"&gt;cm&lt;/a&gt;), and only provides the single identifying number.

Describing himself as a long-time tinkerer, Graafstra's comments do not show much of a hesitation to perform this process. "I like to mod things, and I guess it was only natural that it extended to my own body," he wrote in an email to Wikinews.
Graafstra appears to have been impressed by the process, too. "It was odd feeling it [the chip] being pushed under the surface of my skin... without feeling pain, I was able to really get a feel for just how utilitarian our bodies actually are and how... separate the skin layer really is from the muscle layer under it," he told Wikinews. He was able to use his hand to perform technical computer maintenance just an hour after the procedure.

RFID is a controversial technology. Privacy advocates fear that the technology might be abused by governments and used to track people. &lt;a href="w%3AMicrochip%20%28animal%20identification%29"&gt;Microchip&lt;/a&gt; implants have been used for years for tracking lost pets.

The pictures that Graafstra posted spurred commentary in the &lt;a href="w%3Ablogosphere"&gt;blogosphere&lt;/a&gt;, with some assuming that the pictures &amp;mdash; or the process &amp;mdash; were faked. Graafstra denies this, and posted a short video of himself triggering the RFID reader with a swipe of his hand.

Thousands of demonstrators, reportedly cheered on by residents, overran the &lt;a href="w%3AKyrgyzstan"&gt;Kyrgyz&lt;/a&gt; Presidential Palace, seizing control of &lt;a href="w%3ABishkek"&gt;Bishkek&lt;/a&gt;’s government buildings and forcing &lt;a href="w%3AAskar%20Akayev"&gt;President Askar Akayev&lt;/a&gt; to flee the country.

Some 10,000 protesters gathered on central Ala-Too square in the country’s capital this morning. Fighting broke out between supporters of Akayev and the anti-Akayev protesters at the demonstration, and, although it was reportedly relatively minor, a &lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;♡❤Reuters♡❤&lt;/a&gt; witness reported hearing gun fire.

At the rally, the protesters gave speeches stating that the opposition would today finish taking control of the country. Keneshbek Dushebayev, newly appointed Interior Minister and chief of police for the city, called on them to give up their plans, but his pleas were dismissed by the protesters.

However, the Interior Minister assured them that the Akayev's regime would not use force against them, despite the fact that riot police suppressed a smaller demonstration the day before after he claimed that the use of force was lawful.

The Presidential Palace was reinforced with police forces and soldiers as about 5,000 protesters marched to the palace, chanting “down with the Akayev clans.”

The forces surrounding the building, which reportedly numbered in the hundreds, repelled an initial attempt to storm the building by the protesters, but the forces dispersed as about a thousand protesters fought back, armed with rocks and clubs, attempting to storm the building a second time. 

Once inside, hundreds of protesters ransacked the building, throwing portraits of Akayev out the windows and destroying documents.

Thirty people were injured, according to medical officials.

&lt;a href="w%3AInterfax"&gt;Interfax&lt;/a&gt; reported that Akayev had flown to &lt;a href="w%3AKazakhstan"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt; with his family by helicopter earlier. 

Former Vice President Felix Kulov, who was jailed in 2000, was among many political prisoners freed. He praised the "revolution made by the people."

"Let's keep the peace, let's not lose our head," he said into a megaphone on the steps of the palace, addressing the protesters. "I want to thank you that you weren't afraid and were peaceful and civilized."

Felix Kulov was quoted as saying that Akayev had resigned, though he denied this. "Akayev's resignation will come when we find him," he said.

The demonstrations began at about noon local time (0700 UTC), and, by 3:30 (1030 UTC), every government building in the capital was seized. The opposition quickly established a “Coordination Council of National Unity.”

"We will establish order. We will not allow looting. We will hold our own elections to start our rule," Kurmanbek Bakiyev, leader of the newly established Coordination Council said.

Confirming Interfax’s reports, he also said "Askar Akayev right now is not on Kyrgyz soil."

Former legislator Oksana Malevanaya, speaking for the Coordination Council on state television, now under opposition control, said that the former parliament would meet Thursday night.

Kyrgyz Supreme Court Chairman Kurmanbek Osmonov told the session of parliament that the court had declared the elections invalid. He reportedly stated that the court considered the convened former legislature as the legitimate one.

"It's not the opposition that has seized power, it's the people who have taken power. The people. They have been fighting for so long against corruption, against that [Akayev] family," Ulan Shambetov, an opposition activist, said.

Presidential elections are reportedly likely to be held in May or June, followed by parliamentary elections in the fall. The old parliament will serve as the legitimate legislature until the elections are be held.

Top government officials, including &lt;a href="w%3ANikolai%20Tanayev"&gt;Prime Minister Nikolai Tanayev&lt;/a&gt;, who cancelled his trip to &lt;a href="w%3AOsh"&gt;Osh&lt;/a&gt; for negotiations today in light of the new developments, and State Secretary Osmonakun Ibraimov, resigned.

Opposition MP &lt;a href="w%3AIshinbai%20Kadyrbekov"&gt;Ishinbai Kadyrbekov&lt;/a&gt;, former parliamentary speaker, was named acting president and newly freed Felix Kulov was named head of the ministries of security in the country by the parliament.

Elsewhere, in &lt;a href="w%3ABatken"&gt;Batken&lt;/a&gt;, the third regional center in the south after now opposition controlled Osh and &lt;a href="w%3AJalalabad%2C%20Kyrgyzstan"&gt;Jalal-Abad&lt;/a&gt;, hundreds of protesters broke through police lines and seized government buildings.

Monica Whitlock, a correspondent for the &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;, notes she observed that some protesters carried pink banners while others carried yellow ones, suggesting that the opposition is fractured.

Widespread looting reportedly continued overnight, as law enforcement officers were not present on Bishkek's streets. Bishkek was described as sinking into a state of "anarchy" by one observer, as gangs of people roamed the streets and plundered stores of consumer goods. Several Bishkek residents blamed protesters from the south for the lawlessness.

"There are looters and there are no police to stop them," Felix Kulov told ♡❤Reuters♡❤. "The law enforcement bodies are completely demoralised."

Amid the continued instability, &lt;a href="w%3AKazakhstan"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt; tightened security along its border with Kyrgyzstan, as &lt;a href="w%3AUzbekistan"&gt;Uzbekistan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATajikistan"&gt;Tajikistan&lt;/a&gt; have recently done.

<h1>Sony's PlayStation Portable is launched in North America</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Sony%27s%20PlayStation%20Portable%20is%20launched%20in%20North%20America&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3ASony"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt; launched its eagerly anticipated &lt;a href="w%3APlayStation%20Portable"&gt;PlayStation Portable&lt;/a&gt; (PSP) in the &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20American"&gt;North American&lt;/a&gt; market today. The PlayStation costs $250 and plays &lt;a href="w%3Amp3"&gt;MP3 files&lt;/a&gt;, movies and of course games.

Launched previously in &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; last year with much fanfare, the PSP quickly achieved sales of more than 800,000 units. The device is Sony's first major attempt at challenging &lt;a href="w%3ANintendo"&gt;Nintendo's&lt;/a&gt; long held grip on the market for handheld games. 

Nintendo currently holds a 90 percent of the market share for handhelds in North America. With the recent introduction of &lt;a href="w%3ANintendo%20DS"&gt;Nintendo DS&lt;/a&gt;, the fight for control of this market is expected to become even more intense. 

<h2>Japanese launch</h2>

The first shipment of 200,000 PSP units were made available for purchase in Japan on &lt;a href="w%3ADecember%2012"&gt;December 12&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3A2004"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;. All units sold out within the first two days. Some users reported problems with the launch units, including &lt;a href="w%3Adead%20pixel"&gt;dead pixels&lt;/a&gt; (discolored squares) within the &lt;a href="w%3Aliquid%20crystal%20display"&gt;LCD&lt;/a&gt; screen and game discs ejecting abruptly if the system is twisted. Sony offered to replace these PSPs under warranty, but said they do not consider a display faulty unless four pixels are within 1&lt;a href="w%3Acentimetre"&gt;cm&lt;/a&gt; (0.39 &lt;a href="w%3Ainch"&gt;in&lt;/a&gt;) of each other.

<h2>Technical specifications</h2>

The unit measures 170 &lt;a href="w%3Amillimetre"&gt;mm&lt;/a&gt; (6.7 in) (Length) × 74 mm (2.9 in) (Width) × 23 mm (0.9 in) (Depth), and weighs 260 &lt;a href="w%3Agrams"&gt;grams&lt;/a&gt; (9.17 &lt;a href="w%3Aounce"&gt;oz&lt;/a&gt;) including the battery. The most noticeable element of the PSP is its 4.3" 16:9 ratio TFT LCD screen sporting a 480 x 272 pixel resolution capable of 16.77 million colors.

The PlayStation Portable's &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20processing%20unit"&gt;CPU&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href="w%3AMIPS%20architecture"&gt;MIPS&lt;/a&gt; R4000 (32-bit) CPU, split into two cores each operating between 1 and 333 &lt;a href="w%3AMegahertz"&gt;MHz&lt;/a&gt;; the system has 32&lt;a href="w%3AMegabyte"&gt;MB&lt;/a&gt; of main &lt;a href="w%3ARandom%20access%20memory"&gt;RAM&lt;/a&gt; and 4MB of embedded &lt;a href="w%3ADRAM"&gt;DRAM&lt;/a&gt;. The primary CPU core is responsible for traditional game processor functions; the secondary core, dubbed the "Virtual Media Engine", is responsible for decoding multimedia, for example the &lt;a href="w%3Ah.264"&gt;h.264&lt;/a&gt; decoder. 

The independent 166 MHz graphics chip provides hardware &lt;a href="w%3Apolygon"&gt;polygon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANURBS"&gt;NURBS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Arendering"&gt;rendering&lt;/a&gt;, clipping, morphing, &lt;a href="w%3Atexture%20compression"&gt;texture compression&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Atessellation"&gt;tessellation&lt;/a&gt;, along with handling image output. Specifications state that the PSP is capable of rendering 33 million flat-shaded polygons per second, with a 664 million pixel per second fill rate.

Unlike Sony's PlayStation 2 console, the GPU (PS2 Vector Unit equivalent) is not programmable.

The &lt;a href="w%3AExpo%202005"&gt;2005 World Exposition&lt;/a&gt; opened today in &lt;a href="w%3AAichi"&gt;Aichi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;. The fair, which runs until &lt;a href="w%3A25%20September"&gt;25 September&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3A2005"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt;, is expected to draw over 15 million visitors from across the globe. 121 countries will take part in what is expected to be a 135 billion &lt;a href="w%3Ayen"&gt;yen&lt;/a&gt; event. 

The first Expo - the ♡❤Great Exhibition♡❤ - was held in 1851 in &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;. The event had always been held in either &lt;a href="w%3AEurope"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20America"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt;, until in 1970, it was held in &lt;a href="w%3AOsaka"&gt;Osaka&lt;/a&gt;, Japan.

One of the major attractions at this year's Expo is the skull of an 18,000-year-old woolly &lt;a href="w%3Amammoth"&gt;mammoth&lt;/a&gt;.

New figures on the &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Ocean%20Tsunami"&gt;Indian Ocean Tsunami&lt;/a&gt; disaster death toll have been released by &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;'s National Disaster Relief Coordination Agency. It confirms 126,473 dead and 93,943 missing in Indonesia, the worst hit nation by far.

The &lt;a href="w%3Atsunami"&gt;tsunami&lt;/a&gt; was the result of an undersea earthquake near the northern tip of &lt;a href="w%3ASumatra"&gt;Sumatra&lt;/a&gt; (in Indonesia) on December 26. The waves struck as far away as Tanzania on Africa's east coast. 

According to Sri Lanka's Centre for National Operations, it was the second hardest-hit by the disaster with 30,957 dead, with another 5,637 people listed as missing.

According to SBS World News today, the total dead and missing for all eleven countries damaged by the tsunami now stands at 282,517. 

&lt;CENTER&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Aid workers claim this figure to be inflated.
&lt;/CENTER&gt;

Over a thousand Europeans were killed in the disaster. Mostly holiday-makers, of those lost it is estimated that one third were German. Another 1,100 were listed as missing.

The &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Security%20Council"&gt;Security Council&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; approved the deployment of 10,000 peacekeeping troops and 715 civilian police to southern &lt;a href="Sudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt;. They will monitor a peace plan that ended the country's 21 year long &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASecond%20Sudanese%20Civil%20War"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The peacekeeping force will enforce a ceasefire agreement between Sudan's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKhartoum"&gt;Khartoum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; government and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASPLA"&gt;Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Jean-Marie Guehenno, head of UN peacekeeping operations, welcomed the Security Council's unanimous support of the resolution, but warned of "serious political hurdles" and "unprecedented logistical obstacles".

"If security does not improve quickly, the killings and rapes will continue. We must not allow allow this catastrophic scenario to become a foregone conclusion," he said.

A discussion group about weblogs, or &lt;a href="w%3ABlog"&gt;blogs&lt;/a&gt; for short, that meets at &lt;a href="w%3AHarvard%20University"&gt;Harvard University's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABerkman%20Center%20for%20Internet%20%26amp%3B%20Society"&gt;Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society&lt;/a&gt; last week began releasing video tutorials about how to blog using various &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Wide%20Web"&gt;web&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AComputer%20software"&gt;software&lt;/a&gt; tools.

&lt;a href="w%3AHarvard%20University"&gt;Harvard University&lt;/a&gt;'s Berkman Center hosts the blogging discussion group, which has met weekly for the past two years.

After months of discussion and collaboration on the new tutorials, at Friday's evening meeting presenters showed off some of their early video tutorials, which &lt;a href="w%3AStreaming%20media"&gt;stream&lt;/a&gt; recorded audio, and previously-captured video of a computer screen, along with simultaneous live audio from a microphone.

Participants learned how similar tutorials can be constructed using free software tools such as CamStudio. Audio of the session was made available on the World Wide Web.

Shimon Rura, a local software developer, presented 

a recent screen-capture + voiceover flash file he had made, demonstrating how to use a &lt;a href="w%3ABookmarklet"&gt;bookmarklet&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="http%3A//frassle.net"&gt;Frassle&lt;/a&gt; blogging package. Other participants discussed video demonstrations of how to &lt;a href="w%3APodcasting"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;, and how to use specific blogging tools such as &lt;a href="http%3A//wordpress.org/"&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;. 

There was also disussion of a recent initiative to set up a &lt;a href="http%3A//wiki.digitaldivide.net/wiki/index.php/Blogging_101"&gt;♡❤Blogging101♡❤ site&lt;/a&gt; for distributing and translating these instructional materials. &lt;a href="http%3A//rconversation.blogs.com/"&gt;Rebecca MacKinnon&lt;/a&gt;, a noted blogger and Berkman Fellow, spoke about the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.bloggercorps.org/"&gt;BloggerCorps&lt;/a&gt; initiative to connect &lt;a href="w%3ANon-profit%20organization"&gt;non-profits&lt;/a&gt; who want broader exposure with local blogging enthusiasts.

The meeting was held inside the main conference room in the Berkman Center's &lt;a href="w%3ACambridge"&gt;Cambridge&lt;/a&gt; offices on Massachusetts Avenue.

&lt;a href="Yahoo"&gt;♡❤Yahoo!♡❤&lt;/a&gt; has launched a &lt;a href="w%3ABeta%20version"&gt;beta version&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASearch%20engine"&gt;search tool&lt;/a&gt; at http://search.yahoo.com/cc, designed to locate content on the web under a &lt;a href="w%3ACreative%20Commons"&gt;Creative Commons (CC)&lt;/a&gt; license. While most &lt;a href="w%3ACopyright"&gt;copyrighted&lt;/a&gt; material on the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Wide%20Web"&gt;web&lt;/a&gt; does not allow reuse, other than &lt;a href="w%3AFair%20use"&gt;"fair-use"&lt;/a&gt; allowances, copyrighted material held by Creative Commons &lt;a href="w%3ALicense"&gt;licensing&lt;/a&gt; allows the public to reuse material in a variety of ways specified by the copyright holder under the licensing agreement.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANon-profit%20organization"&gt;nonprofit organization&lt;/a&gt; behind the license, &lt;a href="w%3ACreative%20Commons"&gt;Creative Commons&lt;/a&gt;, was founded in 2002 by &lt;a href="w%3AStanford%20University"&gt;Stanford&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ALaw"&gt;law&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AProfessor"&gt;professor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ALawrence%20Lessig"&gt;Lawrence Lessig&lt;/a&gt;. The organization provides 11 agreements customized for use in various countries. Depending on the licensing agreement, users can reproduce or modify the work as long as they mention the original creator. Some licenses prohibit reusing works in a commercial setting.

Not everyone is impressed by the new search tool. Shelley Powers, author of ♡❤Practical &lt;a href="w%3AResource%20Description%20Framework"&gt;RDF&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ from &lt;a href="w%3AO%27Reilly%20Media"&gt;O'Reilly Press&lt;/a&gt;, writes in her book's blog, "Since CC licenses are recorded using a standardized meta language," ♡❤Yahoo!♡❤ is, "just checking for this information in the process of their normal operations." John Batelle of Searchblog points out that &lt;a href="w%3AA9.com"&gt;A9.com&lt;/a&gt; incorporates a similar feature in A9.com's &lt;a href="http%3A//opensearch.a9.com/"&gt;Open Search&lt;/a&gt;. Wikinews reporter found that A9.com requires registration and &lt;a href="w%3ALogin"&gt;login&lt;/a&gt; to use the Creative Commons search.

Lessig recently reflected on Creative Commons' success in a guest post at ♡❤Yahoo!'s♡❤ search blog. Describing an event at the launch of Creative Commons &lt;a href="w%3AKorea"&gt;Korea&lt;/a&gt;, he said: "At the end of our final celebratory dinner, one of the judges who had helped launch CC-Korea asked me, 'so what will make CC in the world as successful as CC-Korea?' And I recognized, for the first time, that this project that we started two and a half years ago had finally left home. I was no longer asking others to help; others were demanding from me a success to match their own."

A &lt;a href="w%3ASpotsylvania%20County"&gt;Spotsylvania County&lt;/a&gt; woman, whose three dogs allegedly attacked and killed her elderly neighbor, was freed Wednesday by posting a $10,000 bond. Dianna Large, 36, received one &lt;a href="w%3AFelony"&gt;felony charge&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AInvoluntary%20manslaughter"&gt;involuntary manslaughter&lt;/a&gt; and three misdemeanor charges in an &lt;a href="w%3AIndictment"&gt;indictment&lt;/a&gt; issued last week.

In her first appearance before a judge, she answered Circuit Court Judge William H. Ledbetter questions with simple “Yes sir.” and “No sir.” responses. The short hearing, held Thursday, formalized the charges against her. The involuntary manslaughter charge, a first in the severity of punishment being sought on a dog owner in the &lt;a href="w%3AVirginia"&gt;Virginan&lt;/a&gt; state of &lt;a href="w%3AUSA"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt;, carries a maximum penalty of 10 years.

State procecutor Wiliam Neely said that Large knowingly let her three &lt;a href="w%3APit%20bull"&gt;Pit Bull dogs&lt;/a&gt; run free, and that an animal control agency person had warned her to keep them under better control. She also a violated a &lt;a href="w%3ACounty%23United%20States"&gt;county&lt;/a&gt; ordinance requiring owners of dangerous dogs to post a warning sign to visitors. The prosecution also noted that none of the three male dogs were neutered.

The Animal Control Department of Virginia maintains a dangerous dog registry. It contains a list of owners whose dogs are deemed dangerous to society. The &lt;a href="w%3AWeb%20linkweb"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to the registry was moved to a more prominent position on the county web page following the attack.

Hundreds of protesters arrived at the Baxter detention centre in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Australian"&gt;South Australian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; desert to demonstrate against the incarceration of refugees held there. An additional 300 protesters converged on the home of Immigration Minister &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Senate"&gt;Senator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAmanda%20Vanstone"&gt;Amanda Vanstone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , in the state capital of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAdelaide"&gt;Adelaide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , on their way to Baxter.

People from all over Australia are protesting against the &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n Government's policy of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMandatory%20detention%20in%20Australia"&gt;mandatory detention&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The first protesters arrived by buses in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APort%20Augusta"&gt;Port Augusta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; early Friday morning.

Detainees seem split over the protest. ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Age"&gt;The Age&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ reported Detainee Peter Qasim as saying, "It stops people from visiting us, it stops us receiving any calls. It is a good idea to protest but better somewhere other than here."

However, other detainees have been reported as saying, "It is better in front of Baxter, I believe showing Baxter, protesters will shout about human torture inside detention. Then there would be good publicity about all torture inside Baxter detention."

And, "We welcome all of [the protesters] and we thank [them] all who has seen disgrace of this human torture. Further we thank to you all who come and visit and looking after us all the time, we need it."

Despite fears of violence, there has been no confrontation between the police and the protesters.

Scientists have uncovered &lt;a href="w%3Asoft%20bone%20tissue"&gt;soft bone tissue&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href="w%3ATyrannosaurus%20Rex"&gt;Tyrannosaurus Rex&lt;/a&gt; known as MOR 1125, found in a sandstone formation in &lt;a href="w%3AMontana"&gt;Montana&lt;/a&gt;.

MOR 1125 was 18 years old when it died, 65 million years ago. Similar tissue of a &lt;a href="w%3Adinosaur"&gt;dinosaur&lt;/a&gt; has never been found before, as all remains found until now were &lt;a href="w%3Afosilized"&gt;fosilized&lt;/a&gt;. The tissue still contains microscopic structures resembling bloodvessels and cells. The comparison between the structures found in the T-rex and a modern day &lt;a href="w%3AOstrich"&gt;Ostrich&lt;/a&gt; shows a remarkable similarity. The results have been duplicated with an 80-million-year-old &lt;a href="w%3Ahadrosaur"&gt;hadrosaur&lt;/a&gt; and two other tyrannosaurs. The discovery was reported in today's issue of &lt;a href="w%3AScience%20%28journal%29"&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt;.

Results similar to the popular film "&lt;a href="w%3AJurassic%20park"&gt;Jurassic park&lt;/a&gt;" are unlikely, as the recovery of DNA from the tissue is improbable. The results remain astounding, however, and tests with &lt;a href="w%3Aantibody"&gt;antibodies&lt;/a&gt; that react to &lt;a href="w%3Acollagen"&gt;collagen&lt;/a&gt; shows the tissue may still contain &lt;a href="w%3Aprotein"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;s. “Ultimately if we could establish chemical composition, we would have insights into all kinds of things: diet, sexual maturity, whether the specimen is the male or female.”, &lt;a href="w%3Apaleontologist"&gt;paleontologist&lt;/a&gt; Hans-Dieter Sues said.

Richard A. Hengst of Purdue University said the finding "opens the door for research into the protein structure of ancient organisms, if nothing else. While we think that nature is conservative in how things are built, this gives scientists an opportunity to observe this at the chemical and cellular level."

Matthew Carrano, curator of dinosaurs at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, said the discovery was "pretty exciting stuff." "You are actually getting into the small-scale biology of the animal, which is something we rarely get the opportunity to look at."

RTR television reported 5 people died and about 200 were injured as looting continued Thursday night in the &lt;a href="w%3AKyrgyzstan"&gt;Kyrgyz&lt;/a&gt; capital of &lt;a href="w%3ABishkek"&gt;Bishkek&lt;/a&gt;. The newly appointed head of security ministries, Felix Kulov, said at least 31 police officers were wounded.

Windows were smashed, shops were looted, and shopping centers were set ablaze during the unrest. Gunshots were also heard.

"Former President &lt;a href="w%3AAskar%20Akayev"&gt;[Askar] Akayev&lt;/a&gt; is personally responsible for this. He had a chance to resign, instead of which he ran away," Kulov said. "The looters kept shouting 'this shop belonged to the [Akayev] family, this is why it is ours'."

The Kyrgyz ambassador to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, Baktybek Adrisaev, characterized the opposition's actions as "an anti-constitutional coup." The ambassador claimed that Akayev was in "a safe place" and that he had not resigned.

Most reports, although unconfirmed, said Akayev was in &lt;a href="w%3AKazakhstan"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt;. However, &lt;a href="w%3AInterfax"&gt;Interfax&lt;/a&gt;, by a source they described as "credible", reported he was in the resort area of Borovoye, in the Akmola region of northern Kazakhstan.

"I cannot confirm these rumors. He is simply not here," Ruslan Aubakirov, head of district administration, told RIA Novosti in response to the reports.

Opposition MP Ishinbai Kadyrbekov had initially been named acting president yesterday, but today opposition leader &lt;a href="w%3AKurmanbek%20Bakiyev"&gt;Kurmanbek Bakiyev&lt;/a&gt; was named both acting president and prime minister. "Parliament today appointed me prime minister and gave me the functions of president," he said to applause at a rally.

He urged opposition supporters to not allow looting and stressed that popular opposition figure, Felix Kulov, would coordinate law enforcement. Heads of law enforcement agencies reportedly told Kulov that 90% of their staff were demoralized during consultations last night. Despite these developments, Bakiyev declined to declare a state of emergency.

Bakiyev, outlining his plans for government on Friday, told a session of parliament, "Let me create an executive body of power that will not exist forever, but for about three months."

Kulov, newly freed from prison by protesters, stated he would return to prison when he was no longer needed. "I was sentenced to imprisonment 
and must serve my time," he said. "I am not interested in posts or positions. I was just asked to help protect people and their property."

&lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; and the United States, who both have military bases in the country, vowed to stay out of events. Security at Russia's base was increased, although both countries said they did not expect trouble at their bases.

"Kyrgyzstan is not planning to review its previous international engagements," &lt;a href="w%3AKurmanbek%20Bakiyev"&gt;Kurmanbek Bakiyev&lt;/a&gt; told reporters. "This applies to the air bases of the [U.S.-led] anti-terrorism coalition and the Russian air base at Kant."

The United States called for fresh elections &lt;a href="http%3A//www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2005/43821.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and Russia has pledged to work with the opposition. Russian President &lt;a href="w%3AVladimir%20Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; also announced that Akayev would be welcome in Russia.&lt;a href="http%3A//www.kremlin.ru/eng/text/speeches/2005/03/25/1909_type82914_85908.shtml"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; journalist, &lt;a href="w%3AGiuliana%20Sgrena"&gt;Giuliana Sgrena&lt;/a&gt;, who was hit by American artillery fire after being rescued from kidnappers in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, was released from the hospital Thursday. Her injuries, more serious than initially reported, were caused by a projectile that burst her shoulder open and punctured her lungs. She suffers with fluid build-up in her &lt;a href="w%3Alung"&gt;lungs&lt;/a&gt; to this day and was unable to leave her home to participate in news interviews. 

Sgrena told an independent reporter, &lt;a href="w%3ANaomi%20Klein"&gt;Naomi Klein&lt;/a&gt;, in a report yesterday (Friday, 3/26/2005) on the &lt;a href="w%3APacifica%20Radio%20Network"&gt;♡❤Pacifica Radio Network♡❤&lt;/a&gt; broadcast called "Democracy Now with Amy Goodman," that they were not on a high security airport road which the Americans had claimed. There were no "checkpoints" &amp;mdash; they had already passed through them in the &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Zone"&gt;Green Zone&lt;/a&gt;. Sgrena stressed this as being very important to this story, and little reported upon in the U.S.

She said they received permission from security officials to use a little known, but very secure, road that was near to their airport destination. This road had no roadside bombs &amp;mdash; it is not open to the public and has absolutely no military checkpoints. Access to the road was gained by first passing through the American-held security territory called the "Green Zone". Located in the heart of Baghdad, the zone is probably the only partly secure area of the entire country, according to Sgrena. They had their headlights on for easy identification while they traveled, and were in mobile phone contact with Italian security officials.

Ms. Sgrena asks why a tank would fire high velocity munitions at a small vehicle with permission to cross on such a secure road with absolutely no other traffic? What would the motive be to have her killed? It is known that the anti-artillery munitions were 4 inch long armor-plate penetrating rounds, which could explain her severe injury and the death of her body guard.

Her tragedy and the death of Nicola Calipari have been very detrimental to &lt;a href="w%3ASilvio%20Berlusconi"&gt;Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's&lt;/a&gt; public opinion, particularly regarding his participation in the U.S. invasion of Iraq. She had just been released from a horrible sequence of events beginning with her kidnapping and imprisonment in a small room. She did not know "night from day for an entire month." She feared the house she was in might come under fire from American helicopter gunships. She could hear them overhead at all hours of the day and night.

She was told by her kidnappers that "Americans did not want her to get out alive," which she dismissed at the time as a threat from the kidnappers. She also said the statement by the kidnappers had an eerie overtone to it, since she knew that Bush didn't want any independent journalists to carry tales out of the killing zones, or to talk to everyday Iraqis. 

According to Sgrena, she was placed in the back seat of the escape vehicle with the head of Italy's Foreign Military Intelligence, &lt;a href="w%3ANicola%20Calipari"&gt;Nicola Calipari&lt;/a&gt;, after her release. He was killed during the attack when he shielded Sgrena from bullets by jumping across her body. The shooting was done by heavy artillery on top of the attacking tank, not a simple machine gun. They fired at Sgrena from behind &amp;mdash; hardly a situation where the car could be a threat to the tank. When the driver, Giulian, climbed out of the shot-up car, he was in touch with his superiors in Italy &amp;mdash; and Ms. Sgrena says he was telling them they had been taking intense gunfire, "300 to 400 shots." The Americans aimed guns at him and told him to hang up immediately.

Klein, the reporter with this story, stated the American press has not reported any of this. Nor have they given the American people any idea of the seriousness of the injuries to Sgrena. Sgrena also questioned why the US Army was not aware of her release from kidnapping, as all of the major news wires had reported it prior to the shooting incident.
Late Thursday, Italian Justice minister, Roberto Castelli, contacted American officials for permission allowing Italian police access to the escape car, a Toyota Corolla which was rented from the Baghdad airport. Americans have previously only permitted Italian authorities access to photographs of the car, and have not stated when they will allow the Italians to have access to the vehicle.

Recently Mr. Berlusconi has begun to backpedal on his statement that Italian troops would be out of the war zone by September. He now claims he never said that, and Italians won't leave Iraq until it can police itself.

&lt;a href="Terri%20Schiavo"&gt;Terri Schiavo&lt;/a&gt;'s father made a last-minute appeal to have his daughter's feeding tube reinserted Friday.

"Terri is weakening. She's down to her last hours," said Bob Schindler, Schiavo's father. "Something has to be done and done quick."

Bob Schindler and his wife Mary filed an emergency appeal Friday to have a feeding tube reinserted in their 41-year-old daughter. Earlier Friday, U.S. District Judge James Whittemore rejected the family's previous appeal. On Wednesday, he rejected a similar request.

The new appeal will be filed in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A11th%20Circuit%20Court%20of%20Appeals"&gt;11th Circuit Court of Appeals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAtlanta"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , although that court has twice before rejected the family's appeal.

The tube was removed on Friday, March 18, 2005.

<h1>Canada considers Copyright Act changes</h1>
♡❤♡, ♡❤♡ .

&lt;a href="w%3AOttawa"&gt;Ottawa&lt;/a&gt; announced several proposed amendments to the &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; Copyright Act, including signing onto two &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Intellectual%20Property%20Organization"&gt;World Intellectual Property Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WIPO) treaties and requiring Internet Service Providers to keep records on users who transfer many files online.

According to the announcement, the changes would "clarify that the unauthorized posting or the peer-to-peer file-sharing of material on the Internet will constitute an infringement of copyright."

Recording industry representatives were ecstatic with the news. "This is terrific news," said Graham Henderson, who heads the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Recording%20Industry%20Association"&gt;Canadian Recording Industry Association&lt;/a&gt;. "Clearly, once we get implementation there will be no doubt ... it will be illegal to engage in unauthorized file-sharing."

Over 500 groups, including the &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Progressive%20Party"&gt;Democratic Progressive Party&lt;/a&gt;, are planning a massive march and rally for Saturday in &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei"&gt;Taipei City&lt;/a&gt;. March promoters are vowing to bring one million people onto the streets to protest the &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;People's Republic of China's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAnti-Secession%20Law%20of%20the%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;"anti-secession" law&lt;/a&gt; aimed at thwarting &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan%20independence"&gt;Taiwan independence&lt;/a&gt;.

The march, titled "326 March for Democracy and Peace", will begin in ten different locations, converging on the square near the Presidential Office in downtown Taipei City.

"Democracy and peace are the ultimate goal of the march," said &lt;a href="w%3AJoseph%20Wu"&gt;Joseph Wu&lt;/a&gt;, the Mainland Affairs Council Chairman. Wu announced on Friday that he would take part in the rally, but did not disclose in which part of the parade he would appear.

Taiwan's &lt;a href="w%3AChen%20Shui-bian"&gt;President Chen Shui-bian&lt;/a&gt; announced on Thursday that he will also attend the event with his family.

"I cannot and will not be absent on March 26, and I will take my entire family to participate in this sacred moment in history to walk and stand up together with the Taiwanese people," Chen said. Chen further declared that he has, "heard the outrage and anger of the Taiwan people."

A Chinese scholar warned that the situation could become "further aggravated" by Saturday's planned event.

"The secessionist forces plot to stir up public sentiments to embolden themselves. Such moves are doomed to meet failure," said Huang Jiashu, a professor at the People's University of China. He stated that secessionist forces had "malevolently distorted" the anti-secession law.

The ♡❤Taiwan Domestic News Hour♡❤ on ♡❤ETTV♡❤ is running a ♡❤326♡❤ graphic to note the march and rally during its news reports about the upcoming event, and also has an animated graphic with marchers carrying signs in the lower-left hand corner of the screen.

He says the new deal will not affect his popular television program, which will continue to be produced. 

After initially being carried by only 45 stations nationwide, the host of the long-running syndicated program, ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Jerry%20Springer%20Show"&gt;The Jerry Springer Show&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ will eventually have his radio show heard on all 51 Air America affiliates. The show also is planned to be broadcast by the Sirius and XM satellite radio services. 

Springer said he is committed to making his radio show a success. "Progressive, populist voices need to be a part of our nation's dialogue," Springer said in a press release. "I hope I can make a contribution." 

Although best-known for his low-budget, tongue-in-cheek talk show, Springer does have a political pedigree. He was a Democrat mayor of Cincinnati in 1977 and made a failed bid for governor of &lt;a href="Ohio"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt; in 1982.

A &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; District Court in &lt;a href="w%3ATarrant%20County%2C%20Texas"&gt;Tarrant County, Texas&lt;/a&gt;, issued a summary judgment Thursday against &lt;a href="w%3ACircuit%20City"&gt;Circuit City's&lt;/a&gt; InterTAN Inc., requiring all 950 &lt;a href="w%3ARadioShack"&gt;RadioShack&lt;/a&gt; stores in &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; to stop using the RadioShack brand in store signs, packaging, products and advertising after June 30.

RadioShack's Canadian operations were spun off in 1986 to a new corporation, InterTAN Canada, which was purchased in 2004 by RadioShack's major U.S. competitor, Circuit City. Shortly thereafter, RadioShack sued InterTAN, alleging it had violated the terms of their licensing agreement and seeking the right to terminate the contract early. 

In a statement released following the judge's ruling, RadioShack's general counsel, Mark Hill, claimed: "The most important thing to us was to protect our brand position in Canada." 

Circuit City chairman and chief executive officer, W. Alan McCollough responded today in a press release seeking an appeal: "We respectfully believe the court has erred in the partial ruling entered yesterday and we will use every means of relief possible to exercise our rights under the agreements, including all appeal rights. The Company believes the positions taken by InterTAN are correct and believe InterTAN will ultimately prevail in the legal proceedings."

A lawyer who is expected to become the president of the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Rifle%20Association"&gt;National Rifle Association&lt;/a&gt; (NRA) said in a comment to Associated Press (AP) that arming teachers with firearms is a solution to be considered in preventing school shootings by students. Sarah S. Froman, an alumni of Harvard Law School and a practicing lawyer, implied that allowing teachers to carry weapons is one of the many options that should be examined.

Guns and other weapons are commonly banned on school campuses in the United States, but the high-profile incidents of students defying the bans and bringing firearms to classes could place the school at a disadvantage if the student were to fire the weapon. In the case of the recent student shooting at a Native American reservation in Minnessota the school had metal detectors and had an on-duty security guard. The guard was unarmed, however, and was gunned down by the student.

Froman told the AP that if it is the responsibility of teachers to protect students from harm, then the society must find a way to let teachers do that. She also said that gun control laws or bans cannot prevent a malicious individual from acting out, and provided an example of a 1997 shooting incident where an armed teacher was able to help police apprehend the student.

Froman is currently the NRA's first vice president, and is expected to be elected to the post of president in the organization's elections next month. The current president of the 4-million member organization is actor and activist &lt;a href="w%3ACharlton%20Heston"&gt;Charlton Heston&lt;/a&gt;.

Watson Research Center in Cambridge released a free tool March 25 for visualizing the changing history of a document or directory of documents, called ♡❤history flow♡❤. The tool offers a variety of views of document histories, including a view that gives each revision equal importance, and a timeline view which displays each revision proportionally to how long it remained current. Each different editor who makes changes to the article has a distinct color, allowing for that editor's text to be tracked over time. 

The tool was first developed in 2003 by a collaboration between Fernanda B. Viégas of the MIT Media Lab and Martin Wattenberg and Kushal Dave of IBM. It was initially tested out on a large subset of the pages of &lt;a href="w%3AMain%20Page"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, a free online encyclopedia project which preserves every change made to each of its articles. The resulting paper was drafted in the winter of 2003 and presented at a conference in April 2004; it remains the most comprehensive overview of the lifecycle of articles in an active wiki community. A year later, the history flow paper is still the most frequently cited source of statistics about the reversion of vandalism on Wikipedia.

The current tool is maintained by Martin Wattenberg and Jonathan Feinberg at IBM. It allows users to download the text and histories of the contents of any &lt;a href="w%3AMoin%20Moin"&gt;MoinMoin&lt;/a&gt; wiki, or to view the history of the contents of an entire directory of documents. The tool is free to download and use, but its code is not &lt;a href="w%3AOpen%20source"&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt;. The support for MoinMoin wikis comes via a &lt;a href="w%3Aplugin"&gt;plugin&lt;/a&gt;, so the tool may be extensible to the native interfaces of other wiki engines in the future.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A%5B%5Bw%3ABrazil"&gt;[[w:Brazil|Brazil]]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
Tuesday (March 22) the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Defense"&gt;United States Secretary of Defense&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADonald%20Rumsfeld"&gt;Donald Rumsfeld&lt;/a&gt; arrived in Brazil for a visit with Brazilian President &lt;a href="w%3ALuiz%20Inacio%20Lula%20da%20Silva"&gt;Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva&lt;/a&gt;, Vice-President and Defense Minister José Alencar, and other top officials.

In a meeting with President Lula DaSilva and his Vice-President and Minister of Defense, José Alencar, Mr Rumsfeld discussed Brazil leading the UN military forces in Haiti, terrorism and narcotrafficking.

Rumsfeld told to AFP journalists:
"The United States has put forward four topics, which we have agreed to take up: application of a law to down [drug traffickers' aircraft]; [UN] operations in Haiti; drug trafficking; and the fight against terrorism, including Brazil's position on security in South America." 

<h2>Joint Press Conference</h2>
Rumsfeld and Alencar held a Joint Press Conference in &lt;a href="w%3ABrasilia"&gt;Brasilia&lt;/a&gt;, the capital city of Brazil.

Rumsfled stated that the friendship between Brazil and United States is long-standing and highly-valued. He added that the US and Brazil were allies in the Second World War and partners in helping to shape key post-war institutions including the United Nations.

Journalists asked both José Alencar, and Mr Rumsfeld if they were concerned about Venezuelan President &lt;a href="w%3AHugo%20Ch%C3%A1vez"&gt;Hugo Chávez&lt;/a&gt;, particularly after his recent purchase of 100,000 AK-47 assault rifles.

Rumsfeld said:

The Brazilian Vice-President said that Brazil prefers not to interfere in the affairs of others: 

President Lula is scheduled to meet President Hugo Chávez, the President of Colombia Alvaro Uribe Velez and Spain's prime minister, José Luiz Zapatero next Tuesday in Ciudad Guayana, Venezuela.

The Workers' Party Secretary for International Foreign Relations didn't agree with the US Defense Secretary regarding &lt;a href="w%3AVenezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;. He said that his "declaration, does not contribute to a process of stabilization of the United States' relations with Latin America. It is a kind of mentality that, unhappyly, still is present in the American state, which considers Latin America as an extension of its territory." &lt;a href="http%3A//www.pt.org.br/site/noticias/noticias_int.asp%3Fcod%3D33460"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 

Rumsfeld praised Brazil's leadership in &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; operations in &lt;a href="w%3AHaiti"&gt;Haiti&lt;/a&gt; where they have maintained order in the country after the overthrow of former President &lt;a href="w%3AJean%20Bertrand%20Aristide"&gt;Jean Bertrand Aristide&lt;/a&gt; in February 2004.

A reporter asked Mr Rumsfeld whether Brazil is ready to have a seat on the &lt;a href="w%3AUN%20Security%20Council"&gt;UN Security Council&lt;/a&gt;. He answered by saying the Department of Defense doesn't have a voice or a role in that and the matter should be answered by the US President and the Secretary of State.

<h2>FARC and SIVAM</h2>
Journalists asked the Brazilian Vice-President José Alencar three if Brazil will declare the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) as a terrorist organization and if the government is worried about the FARC infiltration in Brazilian territory. Alencar was evasive and he refused to answer the questions directly. 

Alencar said Brazil repudiates narcotrafficking and that "if the organization adopts crime as an instrument for raising resources, obviously it is something that must be combated." 

Later he became impatient and said that he had already said everything he had to say. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.embaixada-americana.org.br/%3Faction%3Dmateria%26amp%3Bid%3D3311%26amp%3Bitemmenu%3D"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.mre.gov.br/portugues/noticiario/nacional/selecao_detalhe.asp%3FID_RESENHA%3D119413"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 

Mr Rumsfeld visited SIVAM, the Amazon Surveillance System. SIVAM, which was built by U.S. Defense contractor Raytheon Corporation, is an arrangement of interconnected sensors and radars to supervise both environmental conditions and criminal activity in the &lt;a href="w%3AAmazon"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, 

According to the &lt;a href="w%3ACommunist%20Party%20of%20Brazil"&gt;Communist Party of Brazil (PCdoB)&lt;/a&gt;, about 60 activists protested in the Amazon against the visit of Rumsfeld when he was touring SIVAM.

Renato Rabelo, the President of the PCdoB released a note repudiating the visit of the US Secretary. "The Communist Party of Brazil repudiates the presence in domestic territory of the secretary of the Defense of the United States, Donald Rumsfeld. The undesired visitor is one of the main expoents of the tyrant and imperialist government of the United States", says a excerpt.&lt;a href="http%3A//www.vermelho.org.br/diario/2005/0323/0323_rumsfeld1.asp"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

<h1>Morogoro Plastic, funded by Barclays, to open $2m network of recycling plants in Tanzania</h1>

Morogoro Plastic will open a plastic grinding plant in the &lt;a href="w%3ATanzania"&gt;Tanzania&lt;/a&gt; town of &lt;a href="w%3AMorogoro"&gt;Morogoro&lt;/a&gt; in April of 2005, according to Faustine Rwambali of the ♡❤East African♡❤. The grinding plant will be followed by a network of 5 washing plants around Tanzania. 75% of the $2m (2bn Tsh) investment needed to build the system of plants has been provided by &lt;a href="w%3ABarclays"&gt;Barclays&lt;/a&gt;. The first three washing plants will be in Mwanza, Arusha, and Dar es Salaam, followed by a plant on the island of Zanzibar and one in the southern part of the country.

The ♡❤East African♡❤, a weekly business paper published by the Aga Khan's Nation Media Group, reports the grinding plant will have a daily capacity of 3 tons of plastic. This capacity will be upgraded to 10 tons per day once equipment ordered from Portugal arrives in June, reported IPPMedia, the news arm of East African beverage conglomerate IPP Holdings. Praful Ladwa, the director of Morogoro Plastic, claims Tanzania produces 1000 tons of plastic per day. Once the full network of plants is functioning, Ladwa hopes it will be able to handle more than 75% of that waste stream.

According to the ♡❤East African♡❤, Tanzania has 15 to 20 plastics companies. Ladwa said the new plant system will be the "first of its kind in East and Central Africa." Morogoro Plastic plans to expand its recycling operations into neighboring Kenya and Uganda by 2007. Ladwa asserted that the system would create at least 10,000 jobs in the region.

&lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; announced on March 23 that it will build an indigenous &lt;a href="w%3Aaircraft%20carrier"&gt;aircraft carrier&lt;/a&gt; by 2012.

The announcement represents a historic military development for India and the Asian region. Although India is already one of the nine countries capable of projecting their military power via aircraft carrier, they have not had the capability to build an aircraft carrier themselves.

The project will begin on April 11 with a "steel-cutting ceremony" attended by Indian Defence Minister &lt;a href="w%3APranab%20Mukherjee"&gt;Pranab Mukherjee&lt;/a&gt;.

The vessel will be constructed at a state-owned shipyard with technical assistance from foreign consultancy firms. An &lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; company is providing design consultation while a &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; firm is contributing aviation technology.

The construction of an indigenous aircraft carrier is part of India's larger plan to modernize its navy. India aims to strengthen its navy, and its military power generally, through greater cooperation with and purchase of weapons systems from the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.

In a related development, the United States announced on Friday that it intends to help India become a "major world power."

Three and maybe four protesters were arrested as demonstrations entered their second day at the Baxter detention centre in the &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Australia"&gt;South Australia&lt;/a&gt;n desert. The protesters were arrested trying to get closer to the faculty. Along with hundreds of other protesters, they marched to the back of the centre but were met by police in riot gear as well as mounted police.

Two activists from &lt;a href="w%3ABrisbane"&gt;Brisbane&lt;/a&gt; were arrested in the action, while a third person, who wished not to be identified, was also arrested. Protesters report that a fourth person appears to be missing.

An estimated 400 protesters have been camping around four kilometres from the centre over the Easter weekend, to highlight the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Government"&gt;Australian Government&lt;/a&gt;'s policy of &lt;a href="w%3AMandatory%20detention%20in%20Australia"&gt;mandatory detention&lt;/a&gt;. Police have been using helicopters to watch the protesters as they have marched from their campsite to the centre.

More than 200 police charged at protesters as they marched toward the centre. The protesters had formed a tight group and were slowly marching towards the centre. One protester received a minor arm injury during the clash.

"I think it was quite over the top," said protester Mark Goudkamp. "I mean it was pretty clear [by] the way that we were marching in very slowly, very packed as a united group that we didn't pose any threat to the security of the centre on the inside."

"Everyone was banded together and people at the front knocked down the fences and we moved forces past the barrier and down to the detention centre,” said Kate, a protester from Brisbane.

“We pushed forward and got quite a fair way into the space. The cops rode horses to try to ward us off and generally tried to intimidate us. I was scared, but I felt safe within the group,” she said.

Police have said that they will charge several protesters over damage estimated at several hundred Australian dollars caused during last night's demonstration. The damage is mainly political graffiti and minor damage to a wooden fence just outside the detention centre.

One protester said that despite the threat of prosecution he would continue such actions. "I don't want trouble but... we have nothing but our hands," he said.

"With our hands and with our voices we are going to free the refugees. If the property is being used unjustly, as it is in this case, I think it is the right of every right-thinking person to damage that property to free those held unjustly as the refugees are in Baxter."

However Mark Goudkamp said that this was a minority view. "[The property damage] was a very, very small incident amongst everything else that happened. Of course [police] are going to try to focus in on that to portray it in whatever negative light they can to try to justify their over-the-top presence here," he said.

A conflict erupted between &lt;a href="w%3AGreek%20Orthodox"&gt;Greek Orthodox&lt;/a&gt; monks and &lt;a href="w%3AArab%20Christians"&gt;Arab Christians&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AJerusalem"&gt;Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="w%3AGood%20Friday"&gt;Good Friday&lt;/a&gt;, as the Arab Christians protested the monks' sale of church land to &lt;a href="w%3AJewish"&gt;Jewish&lt;/a&gt; residents.

&lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israeli&lt;/a&gt; police broke up the protest near the &lt;a href="w%3AChurch%20of%20the%20Holy%20Sepulchre"&gt;Church of the Holy Sepulchre&lt;/a&gt;.

Omar Harani, a 25-year-old leading the protesters, told the ♡❤Telegraph♡❤, "We gave the land 2,000 years ago to the Church to look after," and continued, "So it is not their land to sell. For hundreds of years we Christians, who used to be 15 per cent of the population, have been persecuted and driven out of the Holy Land and now we are a tiny minority. But we will make our voice heard to stop this sale."

&lt;a href="w%3AChristians"&gt;Christians&lt;/a&gt; from many countries flocked to &lt;a href="w%3AJerusalem"&gt;Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt; on Friday, to follow the traditional &lt;a href="w%3AVia%20Dolorosa"&gt;Via Dolorosa&lt;/a&gt;, or ♡❤Way of Sorrows♡❤, marking the various spots in the city at which Jesus stopped, according to Christian tradition, on the way to his &lt;a href="w%3Acrucifixion"&gt;crucifixion&lt;/a&gt; on the hill of &lt;a href="w%3ACalvary"&gt;Calvary&lt;/a&gt;. 

Some of the visitors carried large crosses, and others had crowns of thorns on their head.

Visitors from far-flung locales including &lt;a href="w%3AIreland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3APhilippines"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; have been coming in numbers much higher than in previous years, when regular occurrences of violence caused travel to &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; to plummet.

"With the ceasefire and Arafat’s successor, there’s even less reason to worry," said 38-year-old Connon McCabe, from Dublin, Ireland.

"In the last 15 days, we’ve seen hundreds more visitors," said Muslim shopkeeper Hashim Melki. "I like having people in my shop again after four years," Melki said.

Israeli police estimated attendance at the event was about 3,500.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; announced that it will be willing to sell &lt;a href="w%3AF-16"&gt;F-16 fighter jets&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; on Friday. &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20State%20Department"&gt;U.S. State Department&lt;/a&gt; officials said that the sale would improve regional security.

A senior U.S. official, speaking to &lt;a href="w%3AAgence%20France-Presse"&gt;AFP&lt;/a&gt; on conditions of anonymity, reportedly said that the amount of planes which will be sold to Pakistan is "relatively small," although he said that" there is no set limit on what the United States is going to be willing to sell."

Pakistan reportedly wants 25 of the planes, which have a maximum range of over 2,000 miles and are capable of being used for ground or air attacks.

&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; personally telephoned &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;Indian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AManmohan%20Singh"&gt;Prime Minister Manmohan Singh&lt;/a&gt; to inform him of the new developments before the announcement, according to &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; officials.

According to a spokesman for Singh, the Indian prime minister expressed "great disappointment" and said that it could have "negative consequences" for the security of India.

The senior U.S. official also said that "we don't see any impact on the relevant military balances in the region." He added that the United States would be willing to sell both F-16 and more technologically advanced &lt;a href="w%3AF-18"&gt;F-18&lt;/a&gt; fighters to India, if India desired them.

♡❤New Delhi Television♡❤ reports that the offer "has been welcomed" by India's Ministry of External Affairs. ♡❤Xinhua♡❤ has stated that India is seeking a new contract for a purchase of 126 fighter planes. 

The announcement was also welcomed by the Pakistani government. "We welcome this good gesture and it shows good friendship between Pakistan and the United States," Pakistani Information Minister Sheikh Rashid said.

♡❤Xinhua♡❤ reported that potential sales could benefit US aerospace giant &lt;a href="w%3ALockheed%20Martin"&gt;Lockheed Martin&lt;/a&gt;, which hopes to fill "looming gaps in the production line."

The company "has not been officially notified by the U.S. government of any agreement", Lockheed spokesman Tom Jurkowsky told the ♡❤Washington Post♡❤. The &lt;a href="w%3ABethesda%2C%20Maryland"&gt;Bethesda-based&lt;/a&gt; company said that it would have to close its production line in &lt;a href="w%3AFort%20Worth%2C%20Texas"&gt;Fort Worth, Texas&lt;/a&gt; if it does not receive additional orders by this fall.

&lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA's&lt;/a&gt; comet busting spacecraft &lt;a href="w%3ADeep%20Impact%20%28space%20mission%29"&gt;Deep Impact&lt;/a&gt; has moved into its cruising phase towards a rendezvous and collision with &lt;a href="w%3AComet%20Tempel%201"&gt;Comet Tempel 1&lt;/a&gt; on July 4, 2005.

The cruising phase is the second of five phases mission planners have set for the mission. The first commissioning phase was begun soon after launch and was designed to test and calibrate the instruments on board the two-part spacecraft. All instruments have checked out except for the High Resolution Instrument (HRI).

Mission controllers performed a "bake-out" or heating of the HRI to remove moisture that accumulated during the craft's final hours on the launch pad and its travel through the atmosphere. Test images taken after the procedure indicate the device has not reached perfect focus. A special team has been assigned to investigate and bring the instrument into full focus.

"This in no way will affect our ability to impact the comet on July 4," said Rick Grammier, Deep Impact project manager at NASA's &lt;a href="w%3AJPL"&gt;Jet Propulsion Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;. "Everyone on the science and engineering teams is getting very excited and looking forward to the encounter."

Deep Impact has four data collectors to observe the effects of the cometary collision: the High Resolution Instrument consisting of a camera and infrared spectrometer; the Medium Resolution Instrument; and a duplicate camera on the Impactor Targeting Sensor. They will record the vehicle's final moments before it slams into comet Tempel 1 at a relative velocity of 37,000 kilometers per hour (23,000 miles per hour). The Medium Resolution Instrument and Impactor Targeting Sensor are performing as expected.

Dr. Michael A'Hearn of the University of Maryland added, "We are very early in the process of examining the data from all the instruments. It appears our infrared spectrometer is performing spectacularly, and even if the spatial resolution of the High Resolution Instrument remains at present levels, we still expect to obtain the best, most detailed pictures of a comet ever taken."

Deep Impact is a two part vehicle: the flyby spacecraft and a smaller impactor. 24 hours prior to impact, the flyby craft will aim tracking telescopes at the comet and release the impactor.

The impactor is a battery-powered spacecraft that operates independently of the flyby spacecraft for just one day. It is called a “smart” impactor because, after its release, it takes over its own navigation and maneuvers into the path of the comet. The crater produced by the impactor is expected to range from the width of a house up to the size of a football stadium and be from two to 14 stories deep. Ice and dust debris will be ejected from the crater revealing the material beneath.

NASA's &lt;a href="w%3AHubble%20Space%20Telescope"&gt;Hubble&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASpitzer%20Space%20Telescope"&gt;Spitzer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AChandra%20X-ray%20Observatory"&gt;Chandra&lt;/a&gt; space telescopes, along with the largest telescopes on Earth, will observe the effects of the material flying from the comet's newly formed crater along with the imagers aboard Deep Impact.

Deep Impact was launched on January 12, 2005 on board a &lt;a href="w%3ADelta%202"&gt;Delta 2&lt;/a&gt; rocket.

<h1>Gender imbalance in Tsunami deaths</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Gender%20imbalance%20in%20Tsunami%20deaths&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
Up to four times as many women as men died in the &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Ocean%20Tsunami"&gt;December 26 Indian Ocean Tsunami&lt;/a&gt;, figures published by &lt;a href="w%3AOxfam"&gt;Oxfam International&lt;/a&gt; today reveal.

"In some villages it now appears that up to 80% of those killed were women. This disproportionate impact will lead to problems for years to come unless everyone working on the aid effort addresses the issue now. We are already hearing about rapes, harassment and forced early marriages. We all need to wake up to this issue and ensure the protection, inclusion and empowerment of the women that have survived,” said, Becky Buell, Oxfam’s Policy Director.

As well as recognition of the disparity, and further research, Oxfam calls for a number of practical measures including assistance for men in affected areas to "adapt to changing gender roles including caring of children" and better protection for women, who may be finding themselves severely outnumbered by men.

As well as reporting that workers on the ground have been "becoming increasingly aware that a disproportionate percentage of the fatalities there were female", the study looks in detail at a number of locations in &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Sri%20Lanka"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt; and , the three countries with greatest &lt;a href="Tsunami%20death%20toll%20updated"&gt;death toll&lt;/a&gt; from the disaster, and finds consistently that women killed outnumber men.

The differences are explained in the report as originating both in differences in ability &amp;mdash; more men can swim and climb trees in the affected areas than women, and men are generally physically stronger &amp;mdash; as well as in differences in activity that the individuals were engaged in at the time the &lt;a href="w%3ATsunami"&gt;tsunami&lt;/a&gt; struck &amp;mdash; many women in &lt;a href="w%3AAceh"&gt;Aceh&lt;/a&gt; were indoors at home with the children on a Sunday morning, while many men were fishing at sea, or on errands.

In India, many of the women were waiting at the sea-shore for men to bring home the catch, when the wave hit. The wave at sea had not yet broken, and so posed no threat to vessels far enough from shore.

In Sri Lanka in Batticoloa District, the tsunami hit at the hour women on the east coast usually took their baths in the sea.

Women looking after children at the time of the tidal wave were further distracted by trying to save their children, while men away from the house were able to dedicate more of their efforts to saving themselves.

Another factor particularly important in Aceh was that many of the men of the region had left to seek work elsewhere, while women stayed behind in their home community, which was almost completely wiped out by the wave.

The survey looked at Aceh Besar district of Indonesia, the North Aceh district, the two worst-affected districts of Tamil Naidu in South India, being Nagapattinam and Cuddalore, and used rough statistics and anecdotal information from Sri Lanka, where hard figures are not available.

He appeared to worshippers via a video presentation from the &lt;a href="w%3AVatican"&gt;Vatican&lt;/a&gt;.

The Catholic leader has been diagnosed with pulmonary illness and &lt;a href="w%3AParkinson%27s%20disease"&gt;Parkinson's disease&lt;/a&gt;.

Catholic services on this day are strictly liturgies of the word with an optional &lt;a href="w%3AEucharist"&gt;Eucharist&lt;/a&gt;, as the &lt;a href="w%3AMass%20%28liturgy%29"&gt;Mass&lt;/a&gt; cannot be celebrated on Good Friday.

In a land of four million people where roughly one fourth of the population faces danger of hunger, opposition party supporters are receiving a harsh message from government run emergency food stations in the run up to Thursday's election: Vote for Mugabe, or starve. 

As two British newspapers reported four days before general elections, Zimbabwe's leader &lt;a href="Robert%20Mugabe"&gt;Robert Mugabe&lt;/a&gt; is using food as a political weapon in a country dominated by scarcity.

The government food distribution agency is the only source for something to eat for vast numbers of Zimbabweans today. Determined to destroy opposition parties, Mugabe and his supporters seek to prevent anyone who supports the opposition from receiving rations.

In the wake of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's March 26 announcement that it intends to build its first indigenous aircraft carrier, and recent American overtures aimed at greater defense cooperation to help make India a "major power," speculation is rife as to the future geopolitical consequences for the &lt;a href="Asia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;n region and the world.

India's rise to greater military power may serve as a counterbalance to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the Asian region. China is interested in developing a free trade pact with India and has made overtures in that direction, which are under consideration in India.

Indeed, China's military might is also increasing at a rapid rate as that nation's government commits an ever-greater percentage of its budget to national defense.
Nonetheless, the two nations are seeking a free trade agreement (FTA), which some observers have declared as having the potential to be "the most significant event of this decade" for the Asian region.

Hundreds of thousands of demonstrators filled the streets of Taipei Saturday evening, as several political parties and the Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian voiced their opposition to the new anti-secession law passed by mainland China last week.

Protestors chanted "Oppose war, Love Taiwan" in what has been termed a "democratic carnival" in downtown Taipei. The "carnival" consisted of activities of different themes relating to Taiwanese national sovereignty and cross-straits relations.

Reuters news agency reports that organisers had hoped to attract one million people to the marches, but police estimate an attendance of only 230,000 so far.

"I am here to protest against a barbaric China who looks down upon the Taiwanese people," said Fan Wen-yi, a 70-year-old businessman. "The anti-secession law, simply put, is a law that authorises war. If they really see Taiwan people as their compatriots, why do they enact such a law?"

Hundreds of thousands of demonstrators filled the streets of &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20City"&gt;Taipei&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday, as several political parties, 500 civic groups, and &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AChen%20Shui-bian"&gt;Chen Shui-bian&lt;/a&gt; voiced their opposition to the &lt;a href="w%3AAnti-Secession%20Law%20of%20the%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;"anti-secession" law&lt;/a&gt; passed by the &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; last week.

The ♡❤Associated Press♡❤ and the ♡❤Sydney Morning Herald♡❤ estimated turnout at close to one million. Police spokesman Tan Szu-huai initially provided an estimate of about 300,000, but ♡❤AP♡❤ is reporting a revised police estimate of one million. ♡❤Reuters♡❤ news agency reports that organisers had hoped to attract one million people to the march.

"What do we want from China? Peace!" &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Progressive%20Party"&gt;DPP&lt;/a&gt; lawmaker Bikhim Hsiao chanted with the crowd.

Hsiao told ♡❤CNN♡❤, "[This law] essentially gives China a blank check to use force against Taiwan, and they are the ones legislating, they are the ones interpreting the law, and executing and implementing the law."

<h3>President Chen participates</h3>
Taiwan's President Chen Shui-bian joined the protesters with his family and a security escort at 3pm local time. Chen is not scheduled to make a major speech to the crowd once they assemble at Presidential Office in downtown Taipei City, although he will preside over a ceremony with songs for each of the four major ethnic groups before the rally ends.

Protestors chanted "Oppose war, Love Taiwan" amongst what has been termed a "democratic carnival" in downtown Taipei. The "carnival" consisted of activities on different themes relating to Taiwanese national sovereignty and cross-straits relations.

Protestors attended from all over Taiwan, many braving arduous ten-hour or longer bus rides to Taipei.

Taiwan's former president &lt;a href="w%3ALee%20Teng-hui"&gt;Lee Teng-hui&lt;/a&gt;, the spiritual leader of the pro-independence &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan%20Solidarity%20Union"&gt;TSU&lt;/a&gt;, and Premier &lt;a href="w%3AFrank%20Hsieh"&gt;Frank Hsieh&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Progressive%20Party"&gt;Democratic Progressive Party&lt;/a&gt;, are also taking part in the march.

Vice President &lt;a href="w%3AAnnette%20Lu"&gt;Annette Lu&lt;/a&gt; is expected to make an appearance at the Presidential Office.

Taiwanese television station ♡❤ETTV♡❤ on its ♡❤Taiwan Domestic Newshour♡❤ and others are providing live coverage as the march and rally progresses.

<h3>Reaction from China</h3>
Andrew Yang, secretary-general of the Council for Advanced Policy Studies in Taiwan, told ♡❤Bloomberg♡❤, "China probably won't respond too strongly to the rally, focusing instead on how to make progress in terms of a peaceful, pragmatic approach."

At the time this story was filed, China's state-controlled ♡❤Xinhua♡❤ and ♡❤People's Daily♡❤ news agencies had no immediate comment about the march or the planned rally, but earlier today, ♡❤Xinhua♡❤ reported that on Friday, a Chinese expert "urged the Taiwan authorities to grasp the 'sincerity and goodwill' expressed in the Anti-Secession Law," stating that "Taiwan independence" secessionist forces had "malevolently distorted" the legislation and "sought to instigate hostility" between the two sides.

China's state-run news agencies also quoted professors from Chinese universities on Friday, who warned that the situation could become "further aggravated" by Saturday's planned event.

<h1>Police, militia confront looters in Bishkek, leaders say city now calm</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Police%2C%20militia%20confront%20looters%20in%20Bishkek%2C%20leaders%20say%20city%20now%20calm&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A 6:00 p.m.-6:00 a.m. curfew was imposed in the &lt;a href="w%3AKyrgyzstan"&gt;Kyrgyz&lt;/a&gt; capital of &lt;a href="w%3ABishkek"&gt;Bishkek&lt;/a&gt; on Friday night as policemen and some 2,000 voluntary civilian militia members patrolled the streets. They were authorized to shoot into the air to disperse the looters.

Three to six people were killed as sporadic gunfire was heard in the capital overnight, and 129 people were detained.

Felix Kulov, newly appointed coordinator of law-enforcement, said of the situation on Friday, "The city looks as if it has gone mad."

However, after the night's events, he was confident that the situation had improved. "The situation is fully under control. We do not need a curfew," he said Saturday morning.

"Voluntary people's militia groups and units of the Kel-Kel opposition youth organization are responsible for maintaining order in the city," a source within the Interior Ministry told &lt;a href="w%3AInterfax"&gt;Interfax&lt;/a&gt;.

The opposition has now claimed that it did not originally intend to seize government buildings in Bishkek on March 24.

"On March 24 we didn't plan to seize the government headquarters in Bishkek, we were getting together for a peaceful rally. But when stones started flying at the rally, the people blew up and seized the Kyrgyzstan government headquarters," Rosa Otunbayeva, newly appointed minister of foreign affairs, told a news conference on Friday.

<h3>Akayev vows to return</h3>

Deposed president Askar Akayev claimed that he had not resigned and vowed to return to the country in the future, in a statement released to &lt;a href="w%3AITAR-TASS"&gt;ITAR-TASS&lt;/a&gt;. 

"The rumours about my resignation from the presidential post are deceitful and malevolent," he said in the statement. "Under the circumstances I decided to temporarily leave the country to avoid bloodshed."

Akayev stressed, "my present stay out of the country is a temporary occurrence." 

&lt;a href="w%3AInterfax"&gt;Interfax&lt;/a&gt; reports that Akayev flew to &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3AKazakhstan"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt; Friday night. Russian President &lt;a href="w%3AVladimir%20Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; has said that Akayev would be welcome in Russia.

<h3>Borders closed</h3>
&lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; closed its border with Kyrgyzstan temporarily, until March 28, following similar closings by the countries of &lt;a href="w%3AUzbekistan"&gt;Uzbekistan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AKazakhstan"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3ATajikistan"&gt;Tajikistan&lt;/a&gt; has left some crossings open but has tightened security.

Many countries, including the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; have issued travel advisories, advising their citizens not to travel to Kyrgyzstan because of the unrest.

Officials with the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20State%20Department"&gt;State Department&lt;/a&gt; say the United States accepts the "realities on the ground" and will work with the interim Kyrgyz authorities to build democratic institutions.

The &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; called for the people of Kyrgzstan to behave "responsibly" and offered to cooperate with the new leaders.

&lt;a href="w%3AJavier%20Solana"&gt;Javier Solana&lt;/a&gt;, EU foreign policy chief, also added that "The EU will continue to support the efforts of the &lt;a href="w%3AOSCE"&gt;OSCE&lt;/a&gt; mission in Bishkek."

Russia has said that part of the responsibility for triggering the uprising lies with the OSCE. Russian ambassador to the OSCE, Alexei Borodavkin, told &lt;a href="w%3AAgence%20France-Presse"&gt;AFP&lt;/a&gt; that the OSCE report on shortcomings in the Kyrgyz parliamentary elections in February and March of 2005 had "to some extent, triggered the unrest."

Russia has also called the revolution "illegal," although Russian authorities have also offered to cooperate with the interim Kyrgyz authorities.

A fire which broke out onboard a &lt;a href="Greece"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; oil tanker in the port of &lt;a href="w%3ATema"&gt;Tema&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Ghana"&gt;Ghana&lt;/a&gt; at 9am Friday (local time), now threatens an oil refinery. The chief of Ghana's Port Authority, Ben Awusu-Mensah, said 80 firemen are currently fighting the blaze. "The situation is extremely critical" he said, "they're trying to harness the flames, but there are fears they might catch the refinery".

At least three people have died. Authorities believe the toll will rise to eleven. "We've brought out two more bodies today and we've seen between six and nine more but it is very dark and hot in there," said one firefighter.

Four &lt;a href="US"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; soldiers were killed by an explosion on Saturday morning in &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; when their vehicle ran over a mine. The soldiers, part of a joint U.S.-Afghan patrol, were travelling forty miles south of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKabul"&gt;Kabul&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; when the explosion occurred.

A Marine also died in a separate incident while performing a security patrol in Anbar province.

Seven U.S. soldiers have been killed this year in Afghanistan.

Two U.S. soldiers were also killed in Baghdad and two wounded when their patrol was attacked with a car bomb.

<h1>Chinese government to safeguard old Beijing</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Chinese%20government%20to%20safeguard%20old%20Beijing&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3ABeijing"&gt;Beijing's&lt;/a&gt; city legislature has approved a bill, one year in the making, to safeguard the historical and cultural heritage of old Beijing. The new 41-article set of regulations will come into effect May 1, requiring the city to protect listed heritage sites and unlisted sites deemed of historical or cultural value. It also guarantees protection for the area within the city's Second Ring Road.

Director of the Beijing Administrative Bureau of Cultural Heritage, Mei Ninghua, said "the most encouraging content of the regulations is that Beijing will pay more attention to protecting the old city's landscape in its entirety, rather than just focussing on scattered heritage sites." This means the old city layout, colours of buildings, and the names of houses and lanes will have legal protection.
"We took measures to protect the city's &lt;a href="http%3A//www.oldbj.com/english/english0002.htm"&gt;siheyuan courtyard houses&lt;/a&gt; by tagging protection plates on more than 650 of them in 2003, preventing them from being demolished or damaged during the city's massive housing reconstruction projects," said Mei.

"Now the new regulations give legal buttress to the protection of siheyuan courtyard homes, as well as other unmovable ancient treasures, that have yet to be listed but are at risk of being demolished during urban renovation."

Modern Beijing, capital of China for 850 years, was built by &lt;a href="w%3AKublai%20Khan"&gt;Mongul Emporer Kublai Khan&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3A1267"&gt;1267 AD&lt;/a&gt;. In the vicinity of the current city once was Ji (蓟), the capital of the &lt;a href="w%3AState%20of%20Yan"&gt;State of Yan (燕)&lt;/a&gt;, a power of the &lt;a href="w%3AWarring%20States%20Period"&gt;Warring States Period&lt;/a&gt; - but it has been lost in the mists of time.

<h1>Multiple parliaments meet in Kyrgyzstan, legitimacy uncertain</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Multiple%20parliaments%20meet%20in%20Kyrgyzstan%2C%20legitimacy%20uncertain&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
Although the Supreme Court reportedly annulled recent election results on March 24, two rival parliaments have been meeting in the &lt;a href="Kyrgyzstan"&gt;Kyrgyz&lt;/a&gt; capital of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABishkek"&gt;Bishkek&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The Central Election Commission of Kyrgyzstan voted to endorse the legitimacy of the newly elected and protested parliament on Saturday. 

Both a pre-election chamber, comprising of an upper and lower house, and a post-election chamber, comprising of single house, met in separate rooms of the parliament building on Saturday. MPs from both parliaments are set to meet and debate how to proceed. Among solutions proposed are keeping both parliaments functioning until the next election.

"Our opinion is that we should be the legitimate lawmakers because the people have chosen us," said Roman Shin, who was elected to the new parliament. He said the MPs of the former parliament, which were meeting once again, "don't want to abandon power." 

"The revolution was made by [only] 5,000 people," he said, and added that he and his allies could organize at least five times as many.

"It all happen so fast, we don't even know if we can call it a revolution," Felix Kulov, newly appointed head of security ministries, told &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUPI"&gt;UPI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . "We still haven't figured out what happened. People just ran into the White House and the president fled the country. It was not planned. It was not a revolution. But now we have to take control somehow."

<h3>Protesters meet with Bakiyev</h3>
Hundreds of protesters rushed into the Kyrgyz parliament demanding a meeting with acting President &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKurmanbek%20Bakiyev"&gt;Kurmanbek Bakiyev&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on Saturday, according to a RIA Novosti correspondent. 

They demanded that the newly elected parliament be declared illegitimate. Bakiyev promised that he'd settle the matter within two weeks, and the protesters were reportedly not satisfied by his assurances.

Eight of ten members of the Central Election Commission of Kyrgyzstan voted to acknowledge the protested results of the last election as legitimate. Earlier this week, the Supreme Court declared the election results annulled.

"The decision of the Supreme Court is illegal as it was made under pressure of the crowd. After the announcement of the registration results the Central Election Commission can hold a session, for instance, tomorrow," a newly elected MP, Alisher Sabirov, told RIA Novosti. 

On Saturday the upper house of the former parliament said it would preserve its authorities before the June 26 presidential elections and did not acknowledge the new parliament.

Leaders of key political structures signed a compromise memorandum on the March 25. The memorandum states that the former parliament will continue to serve until April 14. After that, the new parliament will take over.

However, quite a few MPs are doubting the legitimacy of the March 25 memorandum. They are demanding that the former, two-house parliament's tenure be extended. The more radical MPs are demanding that the new parliament, or "imposters," must leave the parliament building. They contend that the memorandum must be revised.

The lower house of parliament is also rumored to be discussing the possibility of declaring a state of emergency, behind closed doors.

<h3>Bakiyev appoints new ministers</h3>
&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKurmanbek%20Bakiyev"&gt;Kurmanbek Bakiyev&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who was elected both acting president and prime minister, also appointed new ministers on Friday. Among the newly-appointed ministers are Myktybek Abdyldayev, former chief prosecutor who had been fired by deposed president &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAskar%20Akayev"&gt;Askar Akayev&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on Wednesday, as interior minister, Felix Kulov as minister of security, and Rosa Otunbayeva as minister of foreign affairs.

The ministers were appointed as acting ministers and thus did not need the approval of the upper house of parliament.

The former parliament also scheduled Kyrgyz presidential elections for June 26. This announcement was met by MPs with applause. 

"I think I should run in the presidential elections. God willing, I will," Bakiyev said.

Adding to the uncertainty, deposed president Askar Akayev has said that he has not resigned and intends to return to the country. However, Bakiyev and Kulov both said that there were no grounds for impeaching or persecuting Akayev.

"The vote of no confidence takes place in case of high treason or after initiation of criminal proceedings. So far, we have no evidence of either," Kulov said in an interview on national television.

"I have no intention of persecuting Askar Akayev. He has done much for democracy and building a sovereign Kyrgyzstan," Bakiyev told reporters.

Bakiyev reportedly met with the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ambassador to Kyrgyzstan and discussed the situation with Russian President &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVladimir%20Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; over the telephone. Putin reportedly offered the county Russia's help.

Bakiyev appealed to the staff of deposed President Akayev and Prime Minister Tanayev's offices to report back to work. "We must re-establish order in the White House," Bakiyev said.

<h1>Conservatives plan to reject budget over newly introduced Kyoto amendment in Canada</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Conservatives%20plan%20to%20reject%20budget%20over%20newly%20introduced%20Kyoto%20amendment%20in%20Canada&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Canadian Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt; plans to reject the federal budget. A recently amended provision allowing the government to control &lt;a href="w%3Agreenhouse%20gas"&gt;greenhouse gas&lt;/a&gt; emissions is "completely unacceptable," says its leader &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt;.

Harper said Thursday his party plans to vote against the omnibus budget bill if it includes the amendment to the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Environmental%20Protection%20Act"&gt;Canadian Environmental Protection Act&lt;/a&gt;. It would add greenhouse gas emissions to the list of controlled substances, allowing the Canadian government to regulate those emissions, he contends. "This is an attempt by the government to get unlimited power to impose multimillion-dollar fines on any basis, without any parliamentary approval or discussion, whatsoever." Harper said.

The controversial amendment was introduced after a lengthy cabinet debate between Finance Minister &lt;a href="w%3ARalph%20Goodale"&gt;Ralph Goodale&lt;/a&gt; and others.

When the budget was tabled last month, Harper initially said his party would support the bill. He now says the party will oppose it unless the Liberal government removes the amendment. Environment Minister &lt;a href="w%3ASt%C3%A9phane%20Dion"&gt;Stéphane Dion&lt;/a&gt;, who is attempting to have a $10 million Kyoto implementation plan in place by &lt;a href="w%3AApril%204"&gt;April 4&lt;/a&gt;, said he would be "very, very pleased" to fight an election over climate change.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;NDP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABloc%20Qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois"&gt;Bloc Québécois&lt;/a&gt; have both said they will oppose the bill. The Liberal Party of Canada has 133 seats, so its defeat seems certain if all four parties hold their positions.

Both the NDP and the Bloc also accuse the Liberal party of trying to tack the Kyoto amendment onto the bill without sufficient debate.

Bloc leader &lt;a href="w%3AGilles%20Duceppe"&gt;Gilles Duceppe&lt;/a&gt; said that he was not satisfied with a number of provisions in the bill. “First of all it's not enough on Kyoto. We don't know the plan, we didn't discuss the plan," Duceppe said. “I'm ready to have an election any time if this is what they want."

NDP leader, &lt;a href="w%3AJack%20Layton"&gt;Jack Layton&lt;/a&gt;, said "The Liberals are playing games with the environment. Paul Martin doesn't care about the Kyoto plan. He cares about playing politics and that is what's going on here."

It will be up to Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Martin"&gt;Paul Martin&lt;/a&gt; whether a defeat triggers an election.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Massive%20star%20cluster%20found%20in%20Milky%20Way&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

European astronomers discovered a very young and huge &lt;a href="w%3AStar%20cluster"&gt;star cluster&lt;/a&gt; within our &lt;a href="w%3AMilky%20Way"&gt;Milky Way&lt;/a&gt; galaxy using &lt;a href="w%3AESO"&gt;European Southern Observatory&lt;/a&gt; telescopes. The discovery was made at the &lt;a href="w%3ALa%20Silla%20Observatory"&gt;La Silla Observatory&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AChile"&gt;Chile.&lt;/a&gt;

Hidden behind a veil of dust and gas, the super star cluster, known as Westerlund 1, is
1000 times closer than any other known clusters. These Super star clusters were previously known to exist as pairs or groups of interacting galaxies located at immense intergalactic distances. It is so close--within 10,000 light years--scientists will be able to examine its structure in detail. Until now, super clusters were far too distant for individual
stars to be distinguished.

Initial observations have led scientists to conclude the group contains at least 100,000 times the mass of the &lt;a href="w%3ASun"&gt;Sun&lt;/a&gt;, with some single stars shining with a power of 1,000,000 suns and 2000 times larger than our own. All the stars are in a region less than six &lt;a href="w%3ALight%20year"&gt;light years&lt;/a&gt; across.

The existence of Westerlund 1's has been known since 1961. Discovered by Swedish astronomer Bengt Westerlund while in Australia, the cluster is located in the Southern constellation &lt;a href="w%3AAra"&gt;Ara&lt;/a&gt; (the Altar). It was a dimming factor of more than 100,000 caused by the gas and dust between us and the cluster that prevented the actual structure and nature of the phenomenon to be determined.

Using a variety of instruments, including the Wide Field Imager (WFI)
attached to a 2.2 meter scope and the Superb-Seeing Imager 2 (SuSI2) camera
on the ESO 3.5 meter &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Technology%20Telescope"&gt;New Technology Telescope&lt;/a&gt;
(NTT), 200 cluster member stars were identified. These and other
observations have revealed the cluster contains young stars on the
order of 30-40 times more massive than our own Sun. The age range has been
determined at 3.5 to five million years old, making this cluster very young
compared to the Galaxy itself at around 13.5 billion years.

The research will appear in the leading research journal ♡❤Astronomy and Astrophysics♡❤, and is titled "On the massive stellar population of the Super Star Cluster
Westerlund 1", by J.S. Clark and colleagues. A second paper, "Further
Wolf-Rayet stars in the starburst cluster Westerlund 1", by Ignacio
Negueruela and Simon Clark will also be published in the same journal.

The &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AMozilla%20Foundation"&gt;Mozilla Foundation&lt;/a&gt; released the second major security update this week for their flagship browser &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AFirefox"&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt;. The fix patches a serious flaw in the way Firefox handles animated GIF image files. Firefox browsers infected by malicious code could experience a buffer overflow, temporarily locking up or "freezing" a user's computer, or even executing arbitrary code which could take over a user's computer.

The flaw was discovered and reported by ♡❤Internet Security Systems, Inc♡❤. The upgrade was the second major security fix in less than a month for the browser, which has grown in popularity to ten percent of the browser market in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. 

Although there were no known exploits of the bug, Chris Hoffman, director of engineering at Mozilla, told reporters, "[because] Mozilla is committed to delivering the most secure product possible, we decided to quickly issue an update to patch the bug."

The Mozilla Foundation did not offer any details about the issue of vulnerability, but a second major security overhaul in such a short time underscores challenges faced by the nonprofit foundation as it goes head-to-head with the market leading &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AInternet%20Explorer"&gt;Internet Explorer&lt;/a&gt; browser by Microsoft.

The new release, Firefox version 1.0.2, "illustrates the dedication of the strong community of developers working on the product," according to Hoffman. "...we’re able to turn around patches much faster than a traditional corporation," he added.
Users can download the update at no charge, and can find additional information at the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/releases/1.0.2.html"&gt;Mozilla website.&lt;/a&gt;

A late night car bomb explosion on Saturday in &lt;a href="w%3ABeirut"&gt;Beirut&lt;/a&gt; wounded 5 people and sparked a large fire in an industrial suburb east of the city. This marks the second car bombing inside a week's time in the &lt;a href="w%3ALebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; capital’s anti-Syrian vicinities.

The blast added an exclamation point to the sudden policy shift by Lebanon's top leadership.

In an announcement earlier Saturday, Foreign Minister Mahmoud Hamoud said to reporters, "Lebanon agrees to the creation of an international commission of inquiry if the [UN] Security Council takes such a decision to uncover the truth in the assassination of Rafiq Hariri". The statement came after a joint meeting in Beirut with UN ambassadors from Britain, China and Russia. Further meetings with UN &lt;a href="w%3AEnvoy"&gt;envoys&lt;/a&gt; from France and the United States are being sought.

Opposition government pressure, spearheaded by &lt;a href="w%3ADruze"&gt;Druze&lt;/a&gt; chieftain &lt;a href="w%3AWalid%20Jumblatt"&gt;Walid Jumblatt&lt;/a&gt;, called for the removal of all Lebanese security chiefs earlier that day. Urging for their resignations, Jumblatt said, “It is not possible to carry out a just, serious, clear and transparent investigation if the heads of the agencies remain in their place.”

Lebanon’s pro-Syrian government originally rejected a UN Security Council report issued Thursday that found, "[security services] has neither the capacity nor the commitment to reach a satisfactory and credible conclusion" in the bombing assassination of the anti-Syrian former prime minster &lt;a href="w%3ARafiq%20Hariri"&gt;Rafiq Hariri&lt;/a&gt;. The UN investigation complained they could not conduct it more thoroughly, partly due to lack of cooperation from Lebanon’s security services. The UN report bolsters Jumblatt claims these services are staffed by pro-Syrian agents and are the source of the car bombings and other lawlessness.

The Hariri assassination on Feb 14 was the galvanizing force that spurred opposition government groups to street protests and rallies. The capital has since been beset with protesting groups both for, and against, the Syrian presence in Lebanon. A recent rally was estimated to have numbered a million people.

In the face of these events and UN pressure, the Syrian capital of &lt;a href="w%3ADamascus"&gt;Damascus&lt;/a&gt; agreed to have its forces leave Lebanon. The Syrians have completed the first phase of its previously announced two-stage withdrawal. A meeting is planned for early April where a Lebanese-Syrian military committee will discuss the how the second stage will be conducted. The goal is for complete withdrawal before national elections scheduled for May.

The worry is that Lebanon may be so far diminished in the vacuum created by the Syrian exit, the country may plunge into chaos.

Scheduled to take place on May 6 in &lt;a href="w%3ASeattle"&gt;Seattle&lt;/a&gt;, this will be the first induction ceremony since the hall of fame moved to Seattle from its previous home in &lt;a href="w%3ALawrence%2C%20Kansas"&gt;Lawrence, Kansas&lt;/a&gt;. Induction into the hall is not based on any single work, according to the hall's press release, but for a lifetime of creative endeavors that "shaped" the science fiction genre.

Inductees come from four categories: film, television and media, literature, art, and a category called "open" which is designed for individuals who do not fit into one of the other categories. 2005 is the first year the hall inducted people for works other than literature.

<h3>The class of 2005</h3>
Only two of the inductees, Spielberg and Harryhausen, are alive to accept the honor. Dick and Bonestell died in the 1980s.

US troops guarding Camp Bucca in southern Iraq have apparently foiled an escape plan by uncovering a 600 ft of escape tunnel leading from the sprawling, 6,000+ person, detention center. The tunnel had apparently not been used, and officials were uncertain how long detainees had been working on it. No information has been given regarding any prisoners who may have been responsible for the effort.

A number of such tunnels had been found before, but none of this scale or quality.

"We were very close to a very bad thing," said Major General William Brandenburg, US commander of detainee operations in Iraq.

The prisoners may have planned to make their move under cover of dense fog that often rolls in from the Persian Gulf.

"There was a good chance they would have got out of the camp," he said.

Extending from beneath the floorboards of a detainee tent to the exterior of the camp, and dug using shovels fashioned from thick poles, canvas, pieces of metal and rope from the tents, the tunnel was buried between 12 to 16 feet underground over its 600 ft length, and around 3ft wide. Dirt had been removed using a cut-open, five-gallon water jug, according to Lt. Col. Guy Rudisill, speaking for the detainee system.

Colonel Rudisill said the guards had begun searching for underground escape passages after finding a 300 ft tunnel last week. They then noticed dirt in latrines and piles of dirt by the camp perimeter.

The facility, with 6,049 prisoners, is twice as large as the notorious Abu Ghraib in Baghdad and holds nearly two-thirds of all those detained in Iraq.

Ignoring ousted president &lt;a href="w%3AAskar%20Akayev"&gt;Askar Akayev&lt;/a&gt;'s refusal to resign, the former, pre-election, &lt;a href="w%3AKyrgyzstan"&gt;Kyrgyzstan&lt;/a&gt; parliament has scheduled a new presidential election for June 26. Acting President &lt;a href="w%3AKurmanbek%20Bakiyev"&gt;Kurmanbek Bakiyev&lt;/a&gt; said he would run in the election.

Meanwhile, former interior minister Keneshbek Dushebayev, who was ousted along with Akayev, announced today he was leading thousands of counterdemonstrators from Akayev's native area of Kemin toward the capital of &lt;a href="w%3ABishkek"&gt;Bishkek&lt;/a&gt;, to protest Thursday's coup, which also began with a group of a few thousand young demonstrators, who in a few hours broke through the lines of guards protecting the presidential headquarters and effectively unseated President Akayev, ending his 14 years in power. It was unclear as night fell whether Dushebayev's march had succeeded in making its way to the capital, but the new leadership which seized power on Thursday following the protests said that it was maintaining control of the country, and that the march had fizzled out.

Bakiyev switched the venue of a news conference today, reportedly because of a rumoured assassination plot. Bishkek was calm compared to the looting and chaos that followed on the heels of the Thursday protests and coup, but bands of looters still roamed the city and government officials were taking no chances. According to an eyewitness AP report, residents of the capital are still "frightened and shocked." 

It is not clear where Akayev is right now; the Interfax News Agency, citing unnamed sources, reported earlier that he has arrived in &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;. Bakiyev has criticized Akayev for fleeing the country in its time of need, and maintains that he is surprised by the speed of recent events. 

"It didn’t enter my head that this could happen," Bakiyev said, according to a Reuters report.

<h1>Canadian union, railway reach last minute accord</h1>
♡❤♡, ♡❤♡ 

The &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Brotherhood%20of%20Electrical%20Workers"&gt;International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers&lt;/a&gt; (IBEW) and &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20National%20Railway"&gt;Canada National Railway&lt;/a&gt; (CN) have worked out a tentative agreement, avoiding a walkout scheduled for midnight on the 26th by 604 workers.

The previous contract expired 31 December 2003, and the union notified CN of their intent to strike 23 March. The IBEW members covered under the contract maintain the track signals, and radio and data networks which monitor the movement of trains.

Federal mediators helped facilitate the agreement, invited by both the union and company. &lt;a href="w%3AMontreal"&gt;Montreal&lt;/a&gt;-based CN announced the four-year deal via a Business-wire release, but withheld the terms of the agreement pending a ratification vote, but did say the agreement is retroactive to 1 January 2004.

CN resumed talks earlier in March with 1,750 engineers after the union and company agreed possible work stoppages would be after 12 May 2005. Track maintenance workers signed a 4-year contract deal with CN in February, as well as a tentative settlement with conductors, yard service employees and traffic co-ordinators. In 2004 a 28-day strike by 5,000 clerical and cargo terminal workers cost the company an estimate &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20dollar"&gt;CA$&lt;/a&gt;24 million.

Nine nominees by the commission will be required to submit recommendations for base closures in May of 2005. The three bases in Maine are &lt;a href="w%3ABath%20Iron%20Works"&gt;Bath Iron Works&lt;/a&gt;, the Portland Naval Shipyard, and the &lt;a href="w%3ABrunswick%20Naval%20Air%20Station"&gt;Brunswick Naval Air Station&lt;/a&gt;. Between the three stations, they employ 16,000 workers.

Representative Allen's comments took place in an interview with the ♡❤Kennebec Journal♡❤. His remarks were misinterpreted as suggesting there was a "good chance" some bases would close. The ♡❤Portland Press Herald♡❤, which ran the story using ♡❤Blethen Maine News Service♡❤ as their source, later admitted that "he did not say they had a 'good chance' of being closed." Allen did not disagree with his characterization of "substantial risk" to the bases, but he insisted his comments were not meant to be predictive.

Bath Iron Works is the largest single-site employer in Maine, with 6400 employees. The shipbuilding yard is situated on the western shore of the &lt;a href="w%3AKennebec%20River"&gt;Kennebec River&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ABath%2C%20Maine"&gt;Bath, Maine&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href="w%3AGeneral%20Dynamics"&gt;General Dynamics&lt;/a&gt; subsidiary has been building ships for 120 years. Bath Iron Works is one of two yards in the US that build surface vessels, such as the new DDX class of destroyers for the US military, according to ♡❤WCSH 6 News♡❤ in Portland. The second is Ingalls Shipyard in &lt;a href="w%3AMississippi"&gt;Mississippi&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Jose%2C%20California"&gt;San Jose, California&lt;/a&gt; – Customers are staying away in droves from &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20California"&gt;Northern California&lt;/a&gt; Wendy's restaurants, after a &lt;a href="w%3ALas%20Vegas"&gt;Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt; woman found a finger in a bowl of chili at the establishment.

Restaurant owners are reporting to company headquarters that sales are down since the incident.

"It is an isolated incident. However, it is dramatically affecting sales in that market," said Wendy's spokesman Denny Lynch.

Investigators are still planning to look for the owner of the finger.

"Nobody's claimed it yet," said Capt. Bob Dixon, of the Santa Clara County coroner's office.

Industry analyst Peter Oakes told ♡❤Associated Press♡❤ that there should not be a long-term impact to Wendy's business.

"To me, the yardstick here is whether the single incident prompts the consumer to lose confidence in the brand. It's understandable to see some kind of knee-jerk reaction," Oakes said.

The stock market was closed for the &lt;a href="w%3AGood%20Friday"&gt;Good Friday&lt;/a&gt; holiday, so traders have not weighed in on the stock yet. Wendy's International, Inc. (WEN) closed at US$39.43 on Thursday.

Investigators are no longer certain if the finger found in a bowl of &lt;a href="w%3AWendy%27s"&gt;Wendy's&lt;/a&gt; chili at a &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Jose%2C%20California"&gt;San Jose, California&lt;/a&gt; outlet last week was cooked or raw.

"We're still going to have to sit down with our crime lab experts and see if there's a test that can determine that," said Sheriff's Office Captain Bob Dixon.

Dr. Martin Fenstersheib, &lt;a href="w%3ASanta%20Clara%20County"&gt;Santa Clara County's&lt;/a&gt; health officer, told the ♡❤San Francisco Chronicle♡❤, "The possibilities are still all out there on where and when it came into the chili."

Investigators are working with the &lt;a href="w%3AFDA"&gt;U.S. Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; to track down the suppliers of the ingredients used to make the chili, which included beef, beans, celery, onions, and green peppers.

Denny Lynch, a Wendy's spokesman, admitted that the Wendy's location at 1405 Monterey Highway had no security cameras, so they were unable to determine from video if an employee had been involved with the incident.

Anna Ayala, the 39-year-old woman who found the finger, has returned to &lt;a href="w%3ALas%20Vegas"&gt;Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt;.

"I don't want to talk about it," she said. Ayala refused to say whether or not she had plans to sue Wendy's over the incident. "At this time, I don't know. At this time, I want to be left alone," said Ayala.

Dr. Fenstersheib said that even if the finger was still raw when Ayala bit into it, the risk was low that she would have become infected with anything. However, he advised that Ayala should undergo a series of precautionary follow-up tests.

The opposition parties in &lt;a href="Togo"&gt;Togo&lt;/a&gt; held a demonstration on Saturday to demand a delay in the upcoming elections. The elections to replace the deceased ruler, &lt;a href="w%3AGnassingb%C3%A9%20Eyad%C3%A9ma"&gt;Gnassingbé Eyadéma&lt;/a&gt;, are scheduled to be held on April 24, 2005.

The elections were scheduled after an outpouring of international criticism about the army's installment of the late president's son as the country's new leader. The son, &lt;a href="w%3AFaure%20Gnassingb%C3%A9"&gt;Faure Gnassingbé&lt;/a&gt;, initially circumvented the constitutional process for new elections 60 days after the death of a current president, but announced elections after African and European leaders strongly criticized the move.

The opposition is demanding a delay for the election, because they fear they will not be able to carry out a sufficient campaign. The candidates from the two prominent opposition parties, Emmanuel Bob Akitani and Nicolas Lawson, both registered with the election officials despite the view that elections should be delayed. In a demonstration in the nation's capital, Akitani's supporters cheered as the candidate called for better representation on elected bodies &amp;mdash; something the government denies is a problem.

The supporters of the current government also held a rally in the city, shouting "No" to the prospect of delaying elections.

♡❤♡London♡❤♡ – The former British prime minister Leonard James Callaghan, the Baron of Cardiff has died at the age of 92, just a day before his ninety-third birthday. He died at his home in East Sussex, leaving two daughters and a son. His wife, Audrey, died just eleven days ago. 

James Callaghan was prime minister from 1976-79 before &lt;a href="w%3AMargaret%20Thatcher"&gt;Margaret Thatcher&lt;/a&gt; became prime minster in 1979 after the surprise resignation of &lt;a href="w%3AHarold%20Wilson"&gt;Harold Wilson&lt;/a&gt;. His premiership could be considered to include some of the bleakest times for Britain, since he was Prime Minister during the 1978-79 &lt;a href="w%3Awinter%20of%20discontent"&gt;winter of discontent&lt;/a&gt;, when there were numerous strikes. However, his proudest achievement was the introduction of &lt;a href="w%3Acat%27s%20eye%20%28road%29"&gt;cat's eyes&lt;/a&gt; in Britain's roads when he was transport secretary.

Tributes including the prime minster &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; saying he was a "giant" of the Labour movement. Former rival and prime minister Margaret Thatcher said he was a "formidable opponent". Chancellor of the Exchequer &lt;a href="w%3AGordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt; said he was "mourned throughout the world" and "It was a commitment to public service that brought Jim Callaghan into Parliament in 1945, and while Jim rose to the top he never forgot his roots."

A large explosion rocked an industrial area in the largely &lt;a href="w%3AChristian"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt; area of &lt;a href="w%3ABawshriyeh"&gt;Bawshriyeh&lt;/a&gt;, east of the &lt;a href="w%3ALebanon"&gt;Lebanese&lt;/a&gt; capital of &lt;a href="w%3ABeirut"&gt;Beirut&lt;/a&gt;. The blast occurred at approximately 21:30 local time on Saturday. It is believed that five people have been wounded, two have died, and that three buildings were set ablaze.

An unnamed Lebanese security source stated that a car rigged with explosives was the cause of the explosion. No group has of yet claimed responsibility.

This is the third blast to have targeted Lebanese Christians in a little over a week, and the anti-&lt;a href="w%3ASyria"&gt;Syrian&lt;/a&gt; opposition representatives were quick to blame Syrian-backed elements. Opposition leader &lt;a href="w%3AWalid%20Jumblatt"&gt;Walid Jumblatt&lt;/a&gt; told Lebanese television channel LBC, "They will use all means to try to destroy national accord. It is true that today they are targeting Christian areas but before that they targeted Hariri."

Former Lebanese Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ARafik%20Hariri"&gt;Rafik Hariri&lt;/a&gt; was assassinated in February after a car-bomb attacked his convoy. Hariri had been a vocal critic of the Syrian presence in Lebanon. The attack intensified internal and international pressure on Damascus for a withdrawal of Syrian forces. There had been around 14,000 Syrian troops stationed in Lebanon.

♡❤♡♡❤India v Pakistan - Third Test, Day 3 - Bangalore, India♡❤♡♡❤

Virender Sehwag's characteristic 201 wasn't enough to help India to safety, as a late spur of wickets in the final session left the hosts at 6-379, in response to Pakistan's first innings score of 570, still trailing by 191 runs, at close of play on Day 3 of the third and final Test of this historic series.

Sehwag dominated each and every Pakistani bowler during his dominant batting display, a second score of 200+ against the sub-continental neighbours. His innings, which could have been brought to an end when he was 43 when Asim Kamal missed a sharp chance at short leg, constituted 28 fours and two mammoth sixes.

Sehwag shared vital partnerships with fellow opener Gautam Gambhir, Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar; however none of those blossomed into a dominating partnership, which could have brought the match in the middle, instead of giving Pakistan the edge.

Gambhir was the first wicket to fall on the day, when caught at slip off a wide Sami delivery for 24, ending a 98-run opening partnership. But his wicket had no effect on Sehwag's concentration, as he kept blasting ball after ball, reaching the three-figure mark, when the team scored had reached only 150.

Dravid, on the back of two centuries in the last match, looked solid enough to threaten the Pakistani bowling, however a surprising lapse in concentration had him trapped in front of the wickets off leg-spinner Danish Kaneria, for 22. Even as Sachin Tendulkar, the new man in, looked shaky to start with, Sehwag continued his onslaught, reaching his 150, as well as 3000 runs in Test cricket, becoming the fastest Indian to achieve that landmark.

Tendulkar soon found his feet though; even playing the customary paddle sweep that he has made his trademark. His dismissal was brought about by Shahid Afridi, who deceived him, to edge a straight drive to Younis Khan at backward point.

Post-tea, Sehwag galloped to the double hundred, before losing his cool, just two balls later, to Kaneria, giving a simple caught and bowled chance to the leggie. India lost two more wickets, within just 37 runs, to end up on the back foot at the end of the day. Sourav Ganguly, eluded of a century since more than a year, was stumped off a well-disguised googly for one, off Kaneria again, who finished with three wickets.

VVS Laxman remained unbeaten on 51, with Irfan Pathan joining him at the fall on the sixth wicket, that of Dinesh Kaarthick for 10.

&lt;a href="w%3Achess"&gt;Chess&lt;/a&gt; prodigy and former world champion, &lt;a href="w%3ABobby%20Fischer"&gt;Bobby Fischer&lt;/a&gt;, arrived by jet Thursday in &lt;a href="w%3Aiceland"&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt; after being released from prison in &lt;a href="w%3Ajapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; the day before. Jailed 9 months in Japan for traveling without a valid &lt;a href="w%3Apassport"&gt;passport&lt;/a&gt;, and dogged by a &lt;a href="w%3Ausa"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Afelony"&gt;felony&lt;/a&gt; charge for violating a government sanction, the 62 year old eccentric chess genius was just last week granted Icelandic &lt;a href="w%3Acitizen"&gt;citizenship&lt;/a&gt; based on humanitarian grounds.

In a first order of business to clear Fischer's way into Iceland, a &lt;a href="w%3Alawsuit"&gt;lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; was filed by his lawyer where he alleges the U.S. government conspired to have him arrested, and that his right to &lt;a href="w%3ADue%20process"&gt;"due process"&lt;/a&gt; was violated by not providing him notice of the revocation of his passport.

Describing his detention as “…harsh conditions, amounting to torture,” Fischer said he was “kidnapped” by &lt;a href="w%3Ageorge%20w.%20bush"&gt;U.S. President Bush&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJunichiro%20Koizumi"&gt;Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi&lt;/a&gt;.

The U.S. refuses to acknowledge Fischer’s status as &lt;a href="w%3Acitizen"&gt;citizen&lt;/a&gt; of Iceland, but the &lt;a href="w%3Alawsuit"&gt;lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; blocks his &lt;a href="w%3Adeportation"&gt;deportation&lt;/a&gt; to the U.S. until the legal matter is resolved. Iceland does have an &lt;a href="w%3Aextradition"&gt;extradition&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Atreaty"&gt;treaty&lt;/a&gt; with the U.S., meaning Fischer’s troubles are far from over now. If deported to the U.S., the &lt;a href="w%3Afelony"&gt;felony&lt;/a&gt; charge he faces could carry a maximum 10 year sentence.

The U.S. charges Fischer with violating government sanctions 13 years ago against &lt;a href="w%3Ayugoslavia"&gt;Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;. He traveled to &lt;a href="w%3Aserbia"&gt;Serbia,&lt;/a&gt; then part of Yugoslavia, for a 1992 rematch against &lt;a href="w%3ABoris%20Spassky"&gt;Boris Spassky&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3Arussia"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; chess king, who Fischer defeated in 1972 to become world champion in a famous showdown in &lt;a href="w%3AReykjavik"&gt;Reykjavik&lt;/a&gt;, Iceland.

During his flight to a stop-over in &lt;a href="w%3ACopenhagen"&gt;Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt; while en route to Iceland, Fischer conducted an interview with &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;♡❤AP Television News♡❤&lt;/a&gt; on board. "Bush does not respect law," he told the ♡❤AP♡❤. "It's like in the comics, like Billy Batson used to say 'Shazam!' and he becomes &lt;a href="w%3ACaptain%20Marvel"&gt;Captain Marvel&lt;/a&gt;. He (Bush) just says '&lt;a href="w%3ACombatant"&gt;Enemy Combatant&lt;/a&gt;! Now you have no legal rights.' It's a farce," he said. "This is absolutely cooked up between Bush and Koizumi."

Very opinionated, but normally less outspoken, Fischer’s verbal attacks express outrage over the treatment he is receiving.

A Pakistan official admitted earlier this month that Abdul Khan, one of the country's nuclear scientists, provided centrifuges essential to high-grade nuclear fuel and weapon production to Iran. 

Centrifuges are used to refine Uranium fuel, a dual-use product which can be used in nuclear reactors or in nuclear weapons. The Pakistani government denied any knowledge or approval of the transfer of technology.

Reportedly, Pakistan has refused to allow anyone outside the Pakistani government to interview Mr. Khan, who remains under house arrest at his home in Pakistan.

Seven members of a church were killed by Terry Ratzmann, age 44, in &lt;a href="w%3ABrookfield%2C%20Wisconsin"&gt;Brookfield, Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt; March 12. After shooting eleven people, Ratzmann fatally shot himself. Four victims died at the scene; three others died at a nearby hospital.

There is no clear motive but police say that Ratzmann, a long-time member of the &lt;a href="w%3AProtestant"&gt;Protestant&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ALiving%20Church%20of%20God"&gt;Living Church of God&lt;/a&gt;, may have been angered by the teachings of church leader, &lt;a href="w%3ARoderick%20C.%20Meredith"&gt;Roderick Meredith&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently, Meredith's teachings differed from those &lt;a href="w%3AHerbert%20W.%20Armstrong"&gt;Herbert Armstrong&lt;/a&gt;, founder of the , of which the Living Church of God is a member. Armstrong died in 1986 and Meredith formed a splinter group of the faith which Raztmann joined shortly thereafter.

Church members said that Ratzmann, described as a loner, had been depressed since he was laid off as an engineering technician in 2002. He had been working occasionally at contract jobs since then and his most recent contract as a computer technician was scheduled to end March 25, a week before the shootings.

Mourners created a make-shift memorial outside the Living Church of God building in remembrance of the seven victims.

Sri Lankan Ministry Of Foreign Affairs said the government accepts Beijing's "One China" policy and that Taiwan is an inalienable part of the People's Republic Of China, according to a March 17 press release.

The current foreign Ministry communiqué, recollects the press communiqué issued by the Foreign Ministers of China and Sri Lanka in Beijing in December 2004. Sri Lanka reiterated its support for Chinese legislative measures to oppose forces seeking to secede from China.

In the communiqué, the Sri Lankan government categorically mentioned, Sri Lanka opposes secessionist actions in any form and fully supports a process of peaceful national reunification. The Sri Lankan government further said, it welcomes growing cross-Straits economic and other exchanges such as the promotion of direct trade, mail, air and shipping links.

In the mean time, Chinese President &lt;a href="Hu%20Jintao"&gt;Hu Jintao&lt;/a&gt; issued a presidential order regarding the promulgation of the Anti-Secession Law on March 14, which was adopted at the Third Session of the Tenth National People's Congress, China's top legislature.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Labour%20Party"&gt;New Zealand Labour Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; announced its party list admidst speculations it may call an early election. The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20general%20election%202005"&gt;election&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; must be held before [Sept 24 2005. The list ranking is often seen as a ranking of the importance for each politician to the party. 

Hon. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AParekura%20Horomia"&gt;Parekura Horomia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was ranked at number five, the highest ranking of any Maori MP. The Maori MPs face a strong challenge from the newly formed &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMaori%20Party"&gt;Maori Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AShane%20Jones"&gt;Shane Jones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the highest placed non-MP, is all but assured of a seat in the next &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Parliament"&gt;Parliament&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASteven%20Ching"&gt;Steven Ching&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is placed at 42, and represents Labour's interest in courting the Asian vote. The Asian population has grown significantly over the past ten years within New Zealand. 

The surprising absentee is Hon. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Hawkins"&gt;George Hawkins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the Minister of Police. He has been criticised for performing poorly in the House, and it is speculated he was offered a low ranking and refused. He is likely to return to Parliament on the basis of his strong hold on the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AManurewa"&gt;Manurewa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; electorate seat.

At the time, no other major political party has released its list.
<h3>Background</h3>
&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; changed its electoral system to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAdditional%20Member%20System"&gt;MMP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 1996, before then it used &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFirst%20Past%20the%20Post%20electoral%20system"&gt;FPP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . In the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20general%20election%202002"&gt;2002 election&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Labour won 52 seats. Labour then became government in a minority coalition. Elections are held every three years in New Zealand.

Officials arrested 41 people from five countries Sunday in connection with a trans-&lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;an &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Amoney%20laundering"&gt;money laundering&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; operation. The individuals are suspected in laundering US$300 million in gang-related activities such as prostitution, murder, and arms and drug trafficking, according to police with &lt;a href="Interpol"&gt;Interpol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEuropol"&gt;Europol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The BBC reported citizens of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASpain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFinland"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUkraine"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; were among those arrested and charged with illegally siphoning money from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AYukos"&gt;Yukos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a large Russian oil company. Yukos maintains it was unaware of such activities.

The crackdown went by code name &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOperation%20White%20Whale"&gt;Operation White Whale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and was a joint effort between Spain and Russia, officials said.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Report%20reveals%20Top%2010%20most-confusing%20tech%20buzzwords&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3ADanville%2C%20California"&gt;Danville&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; – The California-based Engligh language tracker, Global Language Monitor, released its 2005 list of most confusing - yet frequently cited - high tech buzzwords to be "HTTP," "Voice Over IP" (VoIP), and "Megapixel." Closely following were "Plasma," "Robust," "WORM" and "Emoticon." 

In early March, the group used a predictive index computer algorithm to track specific words and phrases in the media and on the Internet. They were tracked in relation to frequency, contextual usage and appearance in global media outlets.

The Global Language Monitor claims to analyze and catalogue trends in word usage and word choices, focusing on the linguistic impact on various cultures. The GLM says it relies upon a global network of volunteer linguists, professional wordsmiths and other bibliophiles to monitor the trends in the evolution and demise of world languages. 
<h3>The list</h3>
GLM's list, in order of frequency of use, of the most-confusing technology terms with the group's explanation as to why they are faulty follows: 
<ol>
BULLET::::1. ♡❤♡&lt;a href="w%3AHTTP"&gt;HTTP&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ - HyperText Transfer Protocol is the standard protocol used for transmitting web pages (which are written in HTML (HyperText Markup Language)), not text written while hyper on too much Starbucks coffee. There are more than 1 billion references to HTTP on the web alone.
BULLET::::2. ♡❤♡&lt;a href="w%3AVoice%20over%20IP"&gt;Voice over IP&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ – Voice over Internet Protocol, (pronounced voyp, similar to Detroit) is a way of transmitting voice data over the Internet. VoIP is becoming more popular as services such as &lt;a href="Skype"&gt;Skype&lt;/a&gt; offer people free voice communication with anyone with a broad-band connection.
BULLET::::3. ♡❤♡&lt;a href="w%3APixel"&gt;Megapixel&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ – Approximately one million pixels, not a single, big pixel ("mega" is the metric system prefix for million). "Pixel" itself is a technical term which means "picture element". Digital pictures consist of a grid of millions of pixels, which are square or rectangular dots, each having a single colour.
BULLET::::4. ♡❤♡&lt;a href="w%3APlasma%20display"&gt;Plasma&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ – A plasma display (commonly used in televisions) is a flat, lightweight surface with a grid of millions of tiny glass bubbles containing plasma. A digitally controlled electric current flows through the bubbles causing the plasma inside to glow various colours. Plasma displays have nothing to do with &lt;a href="w%3Ablood%20plasma"&gt;blood plasma&lt;/a&gt;.
BULLET::::5. ♡❤♡&lt;a href="w%3ARobustness"&gt;Robust&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ – Robustness generally means "it won't break easily." It supposedly describes computer programs or hardware that have been well-tested and demonstrated to not crash or fail often, but since it is a vague term by nature (how robust is robust?) it is frequently used by marketing types regardless.
BULLET::::6. ♡❤♡&lt;a href="w%3AWORM"&gt;WORM&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ – While a worm is a type of computer virus, WORM stands for ’Write Once, Read Many’. It describes a file system primarily used for optical disks, such as CDs and DVDs. For example, CD-Rs can only be written (or "burned") once but afterwards can be read many times (otherwise you could only listen to your music CD once). This excludes re-writable CDs which can be written many times.
BULLET::::7. ♡❤♡&lt;a href="w%3AEmoticon"&gt;Emoticon&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ – Emoticon stands for emotional icon. An emoticon is a sequence of characters that look visually like a face and are used in text chat to convey emotion. The most common emoticon is the smiley face - :) - which looks like two eyes and a mouth turned 90 degrees.
BULLET::::8. ♡❤♡&lt;a href="w%3ABest%20of%20breed"&gt;Best of Breed&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ – Not to be confused with the Westminster Dog Show, a best-of-breed product is a personalized solution made of components from various manufacturers; in other words, it's a sort of high tech ‘mix-and-match’.
BULLET::::9. ♡❤♡&lt;a href="w%3AViral%20marketing"&gt;Viral Marketing&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ – A recent marketing trend which relies on word-of-mouth to spread, rather than traditional advertising strategies. It is called "viral" because as people talk about it, the marketing message "spreads" to new people, who in turn inform others, and so on, which is how viruses spread. The Burger King "&lt;a href="w%3ASubservient%20Chicken"&gt;Subservient Chicken&lt;/a&gt;" campaign is considered an example of viral marketing. Computer viruses used by spammers to turn desktop computers into "zombie" spam relays are something completely different.
BULLET::::10. ♡❤♡&lt;a href="w%3AData%20migration"&gt;Data Migration&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ – Data migration is an idealistic (though usually impossible) concept where data can be used by different versions of the program in which it was created (newer or older). The migration (migration means "to move") refers to the fact that the data is moved from one version (or program) to another without difficulty or loss of information. It is a subset of backward and forward compatibility.

</ol>
Other terms being tracked included "&lt;a href="w%3Aclient%20%28computing%29"&gt;client&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="w%3Aserver"&gt;server&lt;/a&gt;," "solution," "&lt;a href="w%3Aprogramming%20paradigm"&gt;paradigm&lt;/a&gt;," "&lt;a href="w%3Abackward%20compatibility"&gt;backward compatible&lt;/a&gt;," and the "&lt;a href="w%3ASTUN"&gt;STUN protocol&lt;/a&gt;."

<h1>Kulov declares newly elected parliament legitimate, Kyrgyz parliamentary conflict deepens</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Kulov%20declares%20newly%20elected%20parliament%20legitimate%2C%20Kyrgyz%20parliamentary%20conflict%20deepens&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;a href="w%3AKyrgyzstan"&gt;Kyrgyzstan&lt;/a&gt;'s parliamentary conflict intensified Sunday as Felix Kulov, appointed acting minister of securities by the reconvening former parliament, endorsed the newly elected parliament and threatened to "take measures to arrest" MPs of the former parliament that would not step down peacefully.

"The new parliament is legitimate and the old parliament's term has expired," Kulov, who was freed from prison by protesters following the overrunning of the presidential palace, said.

"According to the law, the new parliament has to start work... There are people whom I don't like in the newly elected parliament, but I am a law-abiding citizen and will obey the new parliament." He said that he had lost an election because of the interference of deposed president &lt;a href="w%3AAskar%20Akayev"&gt;Askar Akayev&lt;/a&gt;'s authorities, "But despite this, I acknowledged my defeat. We're not hicks here, we're members of the UN."

"Your term has expired. You had been elected for five years. A new parliament has to be elected. Whether you like it or not, I will obey its orders," Kulov said to the former MPs. "If you attempt to call people to go on the streets, I will be forced to arrest you; please don't take offence."

His threats were challenged by acting Prosecutor General Azimbek Beknazarov who said, "These are the people who freed you, will you arrest them?" 

Kulov, appearing to apologize for his remarks, responded "I am tired; I apologize for that."

Beknazarov, closely allied with acting Prime Minister and President &lt;a href="w%3A%20Kurmanbek%20Bakiyev"&gt;Kurmanbek Bakiyev&lt;/a&gt;, admitted the newly elected parliament was officially recognized. But Alevtina Pronenko, a member of Bakiyev's acting cabinet, said of the situation, "I think that the people will not stand for this." She said the decisions of the former parliament should be considered valid.

"If we can’t agree, we will not avoid a civil war,” Beknazarov said.

The Supreme Court declared the new parliament illegitimate and endorsed the former parliament several days ago on March 24, but the Central Election Commission voted to endorse the new parliament, saying the Supreme Court's decision was illegal.

The &lt;a href="w%3AOSCE"&gt;OSCE&lt;/a&gt; is sending legal and constitutional experts to unravel the parliamentary conflict. The OSCE also rejected the recently declared June 26 election date. "I don't believe this [date] is realistic because it's a very short period of time. There are still a lot of questions unresolved -- constitutional questions," Markus Mueller, the OSCE's envoy to Kyrgyzstan, said. "If it does not become quieter, elections will just add to the instability." Its secretary general, Jan Kubis, arrived in Bishkek on Sunday. Kubis, who was involved in negotiations in the Ukraine last year, met with Bakeyev and other opposition leaders.

Bakiyev said Akayev remained the president under the constitution but ways of removing him as president legally were being examined. He also offered Akayev immunity were he to return to Kyrgyzstan.

Kulov said that he was "too busy" to even think about running in the new election, which Bakayev has said is planning on running in.

Ousted interior minister Keneshbek Dushebayev's announced plans to march on the capital with Akayev supporters did not come to fruition. About 700 protesters supporting Akayev gathered about 50 miles from Bishkek, in Akayev's native area of Kemin, and about 150 of them blocked a main road into the capital before dispersing. They said they did not accept Bakiyev as their leader.

"We have not and will not arrest our political opponents or former officials," Kulov said.

<h1>Doctor Who returns as UK Saturday night timeslot lord</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Doctor%20Who%20returns%20as%20UK%20Saturday%20night%20timeslot%20lord&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

After almost a decade off the air, the science fiction television series ♡❤Doctor Who♡❤ returned with new episodes to &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; airwaves on Saturday night, drawing a large audience.

Starring movie actor &lt;a href="w%3AChristopher%20Eccleston"&gt;Christopher Eccleston&lt;/a&gt;, the ninth actor cast to play the Doctor, as the newly reincarnated &lt;a href="w%3ATime%20Lord"&gt;Time Lord&lt;/a&gt;, the new series showed off a bigger budget with expensive special effects and a much darker &amp;mdash; and sexier &amp;mdash; tone. The new star and series got a blessing from actor &lt;a href="w%3ASylvester%20McCoy"&gt;Sylvester McCoy&lt;/a&gt;, who played the Doctor in the 1980s.

"I am very envious about not being in it. The writing is terrific and the toys they play with are much more sophisticated than they were in my day," McCoy wrote in a column for BBC News. "My only criticism was about the &lt;a href="w%3ATARDIS"&gt;TARDIS&lt;/a&gt;. It was far too clean. It needs to look a bit more battered and bruised as if it's been through the odd asteroid or two," he said.

The Doctor's new sidekick is played by &lt;a href="w%3ABillie%20Piper"&gt;Billie Piper&lt;/a&gt;, whose marriage to &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Evans%20%28British%20broadcaster%29"&gt;Chris Evans&lt;/a&gt; ended during filming.

"We're pleased so many people sat down as a family to watch the return of the Doctor," a spokesperson said. Families apparently sat down in droves. Preliminary ratings figures show ♡❤Who♡❤ wooing 10.5 million viewers at its peak, or more than 44 percent of all television households in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, for the debut episode. 

This made it the most-watched show of the evening, easily outpacing second-place ♡❤Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway♡❤ on &lt;a href="w%3AITV"&gt;ITV&lt;/a&gt;, which attracted an average of 7.2 million households. 

The series will run for another twelve episodes.

One of the longest-running dramas in British history, ♡❤Doctor Who♡❤ has been airing sporadically since its debut in 1963. Ironically, the series cancellation in 1989 was due to low ratings.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20government"&gt;Australian government&lt;/a&gt; has been keeping quiet about a &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; committee's repeated criticism of its record on race issues. A report issued over two weeks ago by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has not received comment from the government in the media, and domestic media coverage has been scant, as reported by the Sydney Morning Herald, and confirmed by a search of news search engine &lt;a href="http%3A//news.google.com"&gt;news.google.com&lt;/a&gt;.

According to Australians for Native Title and Reconciliation (ANTaR) National Director David Cooper before the case was heard by the UN committee, "We fully expect the government is going to deflect it by criticising the UN process."

In fact, this criticism was given in the session, and nothing has been heard from the Australian Federal Government since, on the committee hearing and report.

After reciting a list of Australian anti-racism initiatives, ambassador to the UN Mike Smith, described the 18 committee members' work in the previous session five years ago as "cursory" and "unreasonable". He said they had largely ignored progress being made in Australia, yet displayed "an unquestioning acceptance" of critics of the Government.

Regis de Gouttes of France called Mr Smith "exceptionally rude".

Jose Lindgren Alves of Brazil told him, "As a veteran diplomat, this statement, with its language describing programs and attacks on NGOs, reminds me of the sort of statement from communist bloc countries and Latin American dictatorships that Australia used to condemn."

The committee was positive about a number of improvements in race-related issues in Australia over the five years since its last report. These were,

However the report contained a large number of serious criticisms, and a reminder that the Convention prohibits direct as well as indirect discrimination. Australia was asked to report back on progress on a number of items within one year.

The criticisms were,

A Catholic archbishop in &lt;a href="w%3AZimbabwe"&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt; urged followers to start a non-violent, popular uprising against the country's president, &lt;a href="Robert%20Mugabe"&gt;Robert Mugabe&lt;/a&gt;. Archbishop &lt;a href="w%3APius%20Ncube"&gt;Pius Ncube&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday told a South African newspaper that he hopes that Mugabe will be ousted in the parliamentary elections that are scheduled for Thursday.

Ncube is an outspoken critic of Mugabe's government. Ncube said, "I hope that people get so disillusioned that they really organise against the government and kick him out by a non-violent, popular, mass uprising". He believes that Thursday's vote will be rigged, ensuring victory for the currently ruling party, the &lt;a href="w%3AZimbabwe%20African%20National%20Union%20-%20Patriotic%20Front"&gt;Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front&lt;/a&gt; (Zanu-PF). The government was also recently criticized for implying that supporters of the opposition party will be denied food by the government's food distribution program.

Ncube's statements may be seen by the government as a call for unauthorized protest &amp;mdash; a crime in Zimbabwe punishable by up to 20 years in jail. Ncube seems aware of the dangers of protests: "People must be ready even to risk losing their lives; everyone wants to keep safe," he said. The main opposition, &lt;a href="w%3AMovement%20for%20Democratic%20Change"&gt;Movement for Democratic Change&lt;/a&gt;, said that police arrested 200 demonstrators at a rally on Sunday. 

Robert Mugabe has ruled the country since the end of white rule in the country in the 1980s.

&lt;a href="w%3AHarvard%20University"&gt;Harvard University's&lt;/a&gt; fourth ranked women's hockey team Crimson lost to the first-ranked &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Minnesota"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; Gophers, ♡❤♡4-3♡❤♡, after a close title match where Harvard was coming from behind all game. This was a repeat of last year's title match, which the Gophers won by a wider 6-2 margin.

Minnesota's offense was led by Natalie Darwitz, the all-time point leader in women's NCAA hockey. Harvard's Caitlin Cahow tied the game at 3 points, 6 minutes before the end of the game, but Darwitz sealed the win with her 114th point, a rebound shot with 68 seconds left.

This was Harvard's first loss in 22 games, who ended the season with a 27-7-3 record. Minnesota finished the season 35-2-2. The loss came only one day after The Crimson's men's hockey team lost an extremely close semifinal match to the UNH Wildcats, after 15 minutes of overtime.

The Stanford Cardinal defeated the reigning champion Connecticut Huskies 76-59 in the third round of the women's NCAA basketball tournament. The game was played in Kansas City, Missouri, USA. The Cardinal were led by Pac-10 Freshman and Player of the Year Candice Wiggins with 21 points and Susan King Borchardt with 16 points, including 4 of 5 shooting from 3 point range.

The Cardinal jumped to an early 12-6 lead with strong play from Alaskan senior Azella Perryman, but the Huskies fought back to lead by 6 at halftime. The Huskies sank a 3 point shot with 4 seconds left in the first half to double their lead from 3 to 6.

Stanford started the second half with a 6-0 run against the Huskies, tying the game at 33. Strong play by the Cardinal led to a 64-53 lead with 3:27 remaining. In the waning minutes of the game, the Huskies attempted desperate three-point shots, including one successful attempt by senior Ashley Battle, and fouled Stanford players until the end. With 24 seconds left and down by 15, the Huskies stopped fouling Stanford. Susan King Borchardt put in one last layup with 6 seconds remaining, which produced a "smirk" from Stanford head coach Tara Vanderveer, according to KZSU radio broadcaster Danial Novinson.

In &lt;a href="w%3Amainland%20China"&gt;mainland China&lt;/a&gt;, the ♡❤China Daily♡❤ published an editorial under the headline, ♡❤"March sets stage for secessionist scheming"♡❤ in which it labeled the rally as "secessionist scheming" and a "misuse of people power".

♡❤China Daily♡❤ said of President Chen that, "his participation in the protest added to his record as a man of bad faith. Only one month ago, Chen solemnly pledged to develop cross-Straits relations during his meeting with PFP chairman James Soong. Unfortunately he has failed to honour his word."
In Taiwan, former President Lee Teng-hui (李登輝) asked for the ROC government to follow up on the large turnout with concrete measures.

The ♡❤Taipei Times♡❤ quoted Lee, "The March 26 march ended perfectly, yet it wasn't just the close of a political carnival." Lee continued, "It was a new starting point for consolidating people's identification with Taiwan and declaring the Taiwanese people's strong will to defend their right of self-determination."
"That 1 million Taiwanese people came out was a display of the mainstream of Taiwanese public opinion, and officials should respond to that with practical actions and policies," Lee told a symposium. "Otherwise the march will just have been emotional venting, which won't solve the current [cross-strait] problems."

Lee made his remarks at the ♡❤Taiwan Advocates♡❤ symposium.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Jose%2C%20California"&gt;San Jose, California&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — As the April 15 deadline for U.S. private citizens to file their 2004 income tax returns draws near, the government is reminding sellers on eBay that they may have to report any proceeds from sales on the auction site as taxable income.

This could be a surprise to some of the 135 million registered eBay users who consider trading on San Jose-based auction site to be a non-taxable hobby. Complicating matters, eBay says it doesn't report individual sales figures to the government &amp;ndash; users are responsible to report any profits on their own tax returns.

The amount of money traveling through eBay is big business. $33.8 billion worth of merchandise was sold on the site in 2004, up from $5.2 billion in 2000.

Although eBay pays taxes on its share of the sales (5.25 percent cut from each transaction as of Feb. 18), the IRS fears some small businesses are using the site to dodge tax responsibility. Adding to the confusion, some sellers may legally be a taxable business without realizing it.

The U.S. &lt;a href="w%3AInternal%20Revenue%20Service"&gt;Internal Revenue Service&lt;/a&gt; has a nine-point checklist it uses to determine whether or not a money-making activity is legally a business, which means money made is taxable, or a simple hobby &amp;ndash; where it is not taxable. The IRS can consider a person to be a legal "business" even though they never incorporated or claimed to be one.

According to Woodbury, New York-based accountant Bart Fooden in an Associated Press interview, the IRS looks for such things as evidence that the auction seller depends on the eBay sales income to pay for activities other than maintaining the hobby, acts in a businesslike manner when selling on auctions or puts enough time and effort into the eBay activities that there is an obvious intent to make a profit.

But Fooden said in the same interview casual users probably have nothing to worry about. Those cleaning out closets or the garage and selling off junk for less than the original price paid are not turning a profit, so that money is not considered income and is not taxable.

KCNA reported three separate outbreaks at poultry farms in the capital, and said hundreds of thousands of chickens have been culled in an attempt to stop the spread of the disease.

♡❤Radio Pyongyang♡❤ said, "countermeasures are underway to prevent an epidemic and stem the spread to other poultry farms". Experts warned that a bird flu epidemic in North Korea would deprive the population of its main source of protein.

Kim Yong-Taek of the Korea Centre for Disease Control and Prevention said, "Upon its outbreak on those farms the committee lost no time to take emergency measures and meticulously organised veterinary and anti-epizootic work to prevent its spread to other poultry farms."

According to the state-run media, there have been no human fatalities from this outbreak.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Hester"&gt;Paul Hester&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , drummer for the popular 1980s band &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACrowded%20House"&gt;"Crowded House"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , was found dead in a &lt;a href="Melbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; park Saturday.

An ambulance service spokeswoman told the ♡❤&lt;a href="The%20Sydney%20Morning%20Herald"&gt;Sydney Morning Herald&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that ambulance officers arrived at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AElsternwick"&gt;Elsternwick&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Park on Saturday afternoon. They reported Hester had "attempted suicide" and suffered "strangulation". The 46-year-old-father-of-two was last seen walking his two dogs in the popular suburban park near his home on Friday evening.

Hester had a history with bouts of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aclinical%20depression"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , but seemed to be coping well following eight years of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AManagement%20of%20depression"&gt;therapy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Friends told the ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Daily%20Telegraph%20%28Australia%29"&gt;The Daily Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤, however, that he suffered a recent turmoil in his love life. Firstly, there was the end of his romance with long-time partner and mother of his two daughters, and then a parting last December with &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; singer Kashan, whom he planned to wed in May. There appeared to be no indication he was distressed when he left the house to walk his dogs.

Hester, from Melbourne, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, was a founding member of the internationally popular group Crowded House. Previously, he was in the band &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASplit%20Enz"&gt;"Split Enz"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with Crowded House leader &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANeil%20Finn"&gt;Neil Finn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; during the early 1980s. He quit Crowded House in 1994, two years before the band broke up, and became a television personality in Australia with his own prime-time show, then working mostly as a freelance drummer [e.g. for Tarmac Adam]. He had his own music chat show, ♡❤Hessie's Shed♡❤, on &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20Australian%20television%20channels"&gt;Australian TV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the late 1990s, and also had a recurring role as Paul the Cook on the children's program ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Wiggles"&gt;The Wiggles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .♡❤ He also hosted the successful Australian &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acable%20television"&gt;cable&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; music channel ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMax%20%28Australian%20TV%20channel%29"&gt;MAX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡s ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20MAX%20Sessions"&gt;Sessions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ series.

<h1>Magnitude 8.7 earthquake hits Northern Sumatra, Indonesia</h1>
♡❤♡, ♡❤♡ 
&lt;div style="float:right"&gt;

A &lt;a href="w%3AMoment%20magnitude%20scale"&gt;magnitude 8.7&lt;/a&gt; earthquake has been reported in northern &lt;a href="w%3ASumatra"&gt;Sumatra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Geological%20Survey"&gt;U.S. Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt; (originally an 8.2 magnitude at 2:37 ET (7:37 GMT) the USGS reclassified it to an 8.7 magnitude). 
Government spokesman Agus Mendrova reported more than 290 deaths on the island of &lt;a href="w%3ANias"&gt;Nias&lt;/a&gt;. Hundreds of others were reported trapped in collapsed buildings, including structures weakened by the &lt;a href="w%3A2004%20Indian%20Ocean%20earthquake"&gt;December 26th earthquake&lt;/a&gt;.

A destructive wave was intially feared and many nations issued tsunami warnings. After the quake a USGS instrument near the &lt;a href="w%3ACocos%20Islands"&gt;Cocos Islands&lt;/a&gt; recorded a tsunami type wave which the USGS classified as "small." Tsunami warnings were later withdrawn.

The quake occurred at 11:09 ET (16:09 GMT), and is considered a "great" earthquake, the largest of seven grades. This earthquake is also classified as a "shallow" earthquake, occurring within the top 50 kilometres of the Earth's crust. Shallow earthquakes are more likely to cause a tsunami, because as the lower within the surface the earthquake occurs, the less warping of the ocean floor occurs. This earthquake was a thrust quake; the December 26th Indian Ocean quake was considered a &lt;a href="w%3AMegathrust%20earthquake"&gt;megathrust quake&lt;/a&gt;.

The U.S. Geological Survey originally estimated the magnitude at 8.2, but &lt;a href="w%3AJapan%20Meteorological%20Agency"&gt;Japan's Meteorological Agency&lt;/a&gt; measured the quake at magnitude 8.5 and the U.S. Geological Survey later raised its estimate to 8.7. In comparison, last December's earthquake was measured at 8.1 initially by the USGS, before finally being placed within the 9.1 to 9.3 range by scientists in February 2005. 

At 16:29 UTC, an informational Tsunami Bulletin Number 001 was released by the &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Tsunami%20Warning%20Center"&gt;Pacific Tsunami Warning Center&lt;/a&gt;, stating that there is no threat to Pacific coastlines, but warning of the possibility of destructive &lt;a href="w%3Atsunami"&gt;tsunamis&lt;/a&gt; on waters near the earthquake's origin.

There have been numerous reports of persons who have felt the earthquake fleeing their homes to higher ground, and &lt;a href="w%3ASri%20Lanka"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt; was under an evacuation order. Residents of &lt;a href="w%3ABanda%20Aceh"&gt;Banda Aceh&lt;/a&gt;, Indonesia, one of the cities most devastated by the December tsunami, also fled. Since the December 26th earthquake relatively minor tremors have been common however this was reported to be more intense and long-lasting than any &lt;a href="w%3Aaftershock"&gt;aftershock&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;, which was criticized for its failure to alert citizens to tsunami dangers after &lt;a href="w%3A2004%20Indian%20Ocean%20earthquake"&gt;last December's earthquake&lt;/a&gt;, warned about the possibility that a tsunami might hit that nation's southern provinces.

Commander &lt;a href="w%3ALeroy%20Chiao"&gt;Leroy Chiao&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUSA"&gt;U.S.A.&lt;/a&gt;) and Flight Engineer &lt;a href="w%3ASalizhan%20Sharipov"&gt;Salizhan Sharipov&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;), suited in Russian Orlan &lt;a href="w%3ASpacesuit"&gt;spacesuits&lt;/a&gt;, left the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Space%20Station"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt; on a 4.5 hour long &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20walk"&gt;spacewalk&lt;/a&gt; to install antennas for the European &lt;a href="w%3AAutomated%20Transfer%20Vehicle"&gt;Automated Transfer Vehicle&lt;/a&gt; (ATV), inspect and photograph other exterior equipment and launched the &lt;a href="w%3AMiniaturized%20Satellites%23Nanosatellite"&gt;Nanosatellite mini-satellite&lt;/a&gt;. This is the last scheduled walk for the &lt;a href="w%3AExpedition%2010"&gt;Expedition 10&lt;/a&gt; crew.

At 06:25 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;, the two &lt;a href="w%3AAstronaut"&gt;astronauts&lt;/a&gt; left the station from the Pirs DC1 &lt;a href="w%3ADocking%20compartment"&gt;docking compartment/airlock&lt;/a&gt; and proceeded to install the last three of six space-to-space communication antennas for the ATV's rendezvous and docking with the ISS next year.

Sharipov next deployed the foot long, 11 pound Russian Nanosatellite, tossing it into space by hand. The object of the experiment is to develop small satellite control techniques, monitor satellite 
operations and develop new attitude system sensors. Russian ground crews reported good signal reception from the satellite two hours after its release. 

The two astronauts next proceeded to the aft end of the &lt;a href="w%3AIss%20Zvezda"&gt;Zvezda&lt;/a&gt; service module. A &lt;a href="w%3AGlobal%20Positioning%20System"&gt;Global Positioning System&lt;/a&gt; (GPS) antenna and necessary cabling for the ATV was installed and the men worked their way back to the airlock.

The station maintained its attitude, despite the loss of a gyroscope earlier in the space station mission, until the end of the spacewalk. Chiao and Sharipov reported being a safe distance from the attitude adjustment thrusters. Russian ground control activated the jets and normal attitude of
the station was regained.

They returned to the airlock at 1055 UTC, completing the mission an hour earlier than scheduled.

Chiao and Sharipov arrived on the station October 16, 2004. They are scheduled to return to Earth on April 25, 2005. This marks Sharipov's second walk in space and Chiao's sixth.

<h1>Tsunami fears rise after latest Indonesian temblor</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Tsunami%20fears%20rise%20after%20latest%20Indonesian%20temblor&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

After a magnitude 8.7 &lt;a href="earthquake"&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt; rocked &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASumatra"&gt;Sumatra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; late Monday, local populations were reminded of the devastating &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2004%20Indian%20Ocean%20earthquake"&gt;tsunamis of December 26, 2004&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , that killed 273,000 people as they scoured the shores and seaside areas of countries exposed to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Ocean"&gt;Indian Ocean&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , although three hours later with only one small tsunami observed the threat had passed.

Still, according to reports, thousands of coastal residents near the Indian Ocean were evacuating to higher ground for the night in case the experts were wrong. Reports also say &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASri%20Lanka"&gt;Sri Lankan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; authorities urged islanders near the coast to move at least two kilometres inland.

"It looks like many people have left the coasts. I don’t know exactly how many people but they are moving away from the sea shores to the interior areas," Dr. Unni Krishnan, coordinator for relief agency Action Aid said in an interview with a reporter from ♡❤The Scotsman♡❤.

Minutes after data from the earthquake started coming in, half-way around the world from Sumatra, an emergency response center kicked into action. The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Tsunami%20Warning%20Center"&gt;Pacific Tsunami Warning Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (PTWC) in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHawaii"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; issued a tsunami alert - advising "immediate action" and evacuation procedures were advised for some coastal areas.

"Authorities in those regions should be aware of this possibility and take immediate action. This action should include evacuation of coasts within 1,000 kilometers of the epicenter and close monitoring to determine the need for evacuation further away," the PTWC alert said.

The PTWC said they did detect a small tsunami that stuck the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACocos%20Islands"&gt;Cocos Islands&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; south of the quake's epicenter. However the PTWC went on to say that if no tsunami activity was observed within three hours of the 4.10pm UTC quake, there was no further danger. That time has passed.

A spokesman for the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Geological%20Survey"&gt;United States Geological Service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in an interview with the AFP said when such a large quake strikes, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20government%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;U.S. government&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; sends out e-mails, faxes and telephone messages to nearby agencies warning them of possible aftershocks, or likely tsunami activity.

At a news conference intended to be on the &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Conservatives'&lt;/a&gt; childcare policies, &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Howard"&gt;Michael Howard's&lt;/a&gt; decision to sack Conservative MP &lt;a href="w%3AHoward%20Flight"&gt;Howard Flight&lt;/a&gt; has continued to dominate as the ex-Tory deputy chairman's expulsion from the party was the subject of every question.

The affair began when the MP for &lt;a href="w%3AArundel"&gt;Arundel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Downs"&gt;South Downs&lt;/a&gt; was recorded as saying that the conservatives' spending cuts of £35bn would 'only be the start' under a Tory Government. This issue has been of particular significance in the run-up to the expected &lt;a href="w%3AUK%20general%20election%2C%202005/06"&gt;General election&lt;/a&gt; on May 5th.

Mr. Flight has resisted his removal from the candidate list, insisting it is the prerogative of the local party members only and not head office. He has taken legal advice as to summoning an emergency general meeting of Arundel and South Downs Conservative Association.

Howard Flight has insisted that he would not stand as an independent candidate.

Two brothers were swept away and a woman was pulled to safety on Sunday after a wave, said to be 5-6 metres (17-20 feet) high, washed over their funeral service in &lt;a href="w%3ASpain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href="w%3ACanary%20Islands"&gt;Canary Islands&lt;/a&gt;.

The massive wave struck while a party of 15 was spreading the ashes of a 16 year old boy in the sea, according to Manuel Sosa, one of the rescuers. The boy’s father, age 36, and a paternal uncle, age 23, were swept away and are presumed dead. The mother, age 34, was caught in the wave, but rescued.

The tragedy occurred near the village of &lt;a href="w%3AArucas%2C%20Las%20Palmas"&gt;Arucas&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="w%3AGran%20Canaria"&gt;Gran Canaria Island&lt;/a&gt;.

After facing criticism for being slow to act and initially giving too little after the &lt;a href="w%3A2004%20Indian%20Ocean%20earthquake"&gt;December 26 Indonesian earthquake and tsunami&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; government was quick to act when a massive earthquake hit &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; again March 28. U.S. State Department Adam Ereli said under orders of &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;, American embassy officials have been in contact with both Indonesia officials and the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Red%20Cross"&gt;International Red Cross&lt;/a&gt; to coordinate international relief efforts and other foreign aid.

The two former U.S. presidents, &lt;a href="Bill%20Clinton"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt; and the current president's father, &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20H.W.%20Bush"&gt;George H.W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;, already are heading up U.S. aid efforts in the region as the result of the last major temblor. "We still have people over there assisting from the first one, and they will be our first line of defense, once we know what kind of damage there is," Pat McCrummen, spokesman for the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Red%20Cross"&gt;American Red Cross&lt;/a&gt; told the &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;.

Although relief officials have been in contact with various governments, no specific pledge amount has been announced (as of 20:51, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)).

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Ireland%27s%20smoking%20ban%20a%20success%20after%20first%20year&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Tomorrow will be an historic day in the &lt;a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland"&gt;Republic of Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. It will be exactly one year since the initial introduction of the once controversial &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Asmoking%20ban"&gt;smoking ban&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The ban, introduced on March 29 2004, made Ireland the first country in world to completely ban smoking in all workplaces.

The idea was initially met with much skepticism by the Irish who traditionally had a worldwide image as a land of drinkers and smokers. However despite this early uncertainty, the ban has been a huge success. Cigarettes sales have fallen by as much as 60% in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APub"&gt;Pubs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , with the country's biggest tobacco brand, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGallaher%20Group"&gt;Gallaher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , reporting an overall drop in sales of 7.5%.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATaoiseach"&gt;Taoiseach&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABertie%20Ahern"&gt;Bertie Ahern&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; announced earlier this month that over 7,000 had given up smoking in the past twelve months. A survey by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIrish%20Department%20of%20Health"&gt;Irish Department of Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; showed 82% supported the ban. Anti-smoking lobby groups such as ASH had been calling for a ban for many years prior to the Government's initiative.

On 3 December 2003, &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; passed the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASmokefree%20Environments%20Amendment%20Bill"&gt;Smokefree Environments Amendment Bill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; which lead it to become the second nation to impose a total ban. Its ban came into effect nine months after Ireland's, on 10 December 2004. In January of this year &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; also introduced a ban. &lt;a href="Sweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; intends to go smoke free in June of this year and in &lt;a href="Scotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AScottish%20Parliament"&gt;Parliament&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; hopes to have a ban in effect by early 2006.

The newly elected and protested &lt;a href="w%3AKyrgyzstan"&gt;Kyrgyz&lt;/a&gt; parliament today voted to back opposition leader &lt;a href="w%3AKurmanbek%20Bakiyev"&gt;Kurmanbek Bakiyev&lt;/a&gt; as prime minister, as the reconvening former parliament had done days before. The lower house of the former parliament also formally stepped down, although the upper house has not done so yet.

Deposed president &lt;a href="w%3AAskar%20Akayev"&gt;Askar Akayev&lt;/a&gt; issued a statement from &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; in response, accusing the new leaders of disgracing the country and ruining the economy.

In response to the endorsement, Bakiyev issued a statement acknowledging the newly elected parliament as the legitimate one.

"I can be reproached for saying earlier that the February and March polls were not legitimate. I said so. But in this parliament we have questions to only 15 to 20 constituencies, no one is saying that all deputies have to go," Bakiyev explained.

Speaker of the outgoing lower chamber of the former parliament, Ishenbai Kadyrbekov, said that the decision was "a political, not a legislative decision, made for the sake of stabilizing the situation. ...If needed, the Legislative Assembly may convene again."

Despite the situation, Omurbek Tekebayev, newly elected speaker of the new parliament, told Kyrgyz television that Akayev was still legally the president of the country and should return, if only to complete a formal resignation. "New presidential elections can only be called after talks with Akayev, otherwise it will be another anticonstitutional move," he said.

Opposition leaders have offered Akayev immunity and said that he would not be impeached or otherwise prosecuted if he returned to the country.

<h1>Past Jackson abuse claims to be used in court</h1>

In what trial watchers say is a blow to &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Jackson"&gt;Michael Jackson's&lt;/a&gt; defense, Judge Rodney Melville ruled Monday to allow the use of past allegations of &lt;a href="w%3Achild%20molestation"&gt;child molestation&lt;/a&gt; in the trial. The decision was reached in deliberations done in the &lt;a href="w%3Ajury"&gt;jury's&lt;/a&gt; absence. The ruling means that prosecution, led by District Attorney &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Sneddon"&gt;Tom Sneddon&lt;/a&gt;, can introduce what it says are 5 cases of prior molestation. 

The prosecution, which originally submitted 10 cases to the deliberations, was ruled able to proceed with 5 due to a 1995 law passed in California. The law, aiming specifically at child molestation and &lt;a href="w%3Adomestic%20violence"&gt;domestic violence&lt;/a&gt; cases, is unlike other cases where the prior criminal conduct of the defendant is not permissable in court.

The ruling will allow testimony in cases arising from over 10 years ago. Allegations involving the behavior of Jackson, now aged 46, with boys 10 to 13 years old at the time will be presented. So far, only one boy has agreed to testify. In the other 4 cases, third party witnesses or family members, are planned.

Jackson's defense attorney, &lt;a href="w%3AThomas%20Mesereau"&gt;Thomas Mesereau jr.&lt;/a&gt; worked to have the cases excluded during deliberations. Noting that &lt;a href="w%3AMacaulay%20Culkin"&gt;Macaulay Culkin&lt;/a&gt;, of the movie "Home Alone" fame and once frequent visitor of the Jackson's Neverland ranch, in an interview with &lt;a href="w%3ALarry%20King"&gt;Larry King&lt;/a&gt; has previously and publicly stated "Nothing happened." 

Mesereau promised to make a "mini-case" out of each of the new allegations, which could drag the trial on indefinitely. The ♡❤AP♡❤ reports him saying, "You can't stop the defense from putting on a full-blown defense and I mean just that."

In 1993, a molestation charge was settled out-of-court for $26m by Jordan Chandler, ending his accusations against Jackson. His mother plans to testify in this trial.

<h3>The Defence's argument</h3>

Defence attorney Thomas Mesereau jr.:
♡❤"[This evidence would] easily reduce the burden of proof and the presumption of innocence and render an unfair trial."♡❤

The Defense have claimed that some of the boys listed would testify to Jackson's innocence and that they are based on third party claims, many of which are after Michael Jackson's money. ♡❤"How can you just allow a parade of third-party characters to come in without any victims?"♡❤

<h3>The Prosecution's argument</h3>

Santa Barbara County District Attorney Thomas Sneddon has claimed these other cases will show behavior that is ♡❤"very similar, if not identical"♡❤ to that which is claimed by &lt;a href="w%3AGavin%20Arvizo"&gt;Gavin Arvizo&lt;/a&gt;.

Michael Jackson has said ♡❤"None of these stories are true. They are totally fabricated. It's very sad, it's very, very painful. I pray a lot. That's how I deal with it, and I'm a strong person. I'm a warrior, and I know what is inside of me. I'm a fighter, but it's very painful at the end of the day. I'm still human, you know. I'm still a human being, so it does hurt very, very, very much."♡❤

Michael Jackson continues to deny 10 counts of abuse and false imprisonment.

&lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt; researchers predicted two weeks ago that there would be further earthquakes in the same region as the massive &lt;a href="w%3A2004%20Indian%20Ocean%20earthquake"&gt;Boxing Day 2004 quake&lt;/a&gt;.

On Monday night a massive 8.7 scale earthquake hit the island of &lt;a href="w%3ASumatra"&gt;Sumatra&lt;/a&gt;.

On March 17, researchers at &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Ulster"&gt;University of Ulster&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AColeraine"&gt;Coleraine&lt;/a&gt; in northern Ireland published a report in the scientific journal ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANature%20%28journal%29"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that showed stress was building on the fault near Sumatra and that the risk of a second powerful earthquake was increasing.

The researchers said in the report that in subduction zones, a pair of massive earthquakes relatively close together is not uncommon. The last such incident was 1999 in &lt;a href="w%3ADuzce"&gt;Duzce&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATurkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt; where a 7.4 magnitude quake was followed by a 7.1 magnitude quake three months later.

In the Nature report, the researchers pointed to evidence suggesting that stresses in the fault near northern Sumatra were significantly higher than those of the 1999 Turkey rupture. The quake that eventually did strike Sumatra was exponentially more massive than the 7.0 to 7.5 magnitude quake the researches suggested in ♡❤Nature.♡❤ But it still was less powerful than the December 2004 quake and did not result in any life-threatening &lt;a href="w%3Atsunami"&gt;tsunami&lt;/a&gt;.

News spread in the &lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Lake%2C%20Minnesota"&gt;Red Lake&lt;/a&gt; community today as funerals for &lt;a href="w%3AJeff%20Weise"&gt;Jeff Weise&lt;/a&gt; and three of the nine victims were held that another student was arrested in connection with the &lt;a href="w%3ASchool%20massacre"&gt;school shootings&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AMarch%2021"&gt;March 21&lt;/a&gt;. Authorities said little officially beyond confirming today's arrest. However, a source with knowledge of the investigation told the &lt;a href="w%3AMinneapolis%20Star%20Tribune"&gt;Minneapolis Star-Tribune&lt;/a&gt; that it was Louis Jourdain, 16-year old son of Red Lake Tribal Chairman Floyd Jourdain. It is not known at this time what charges will be laid or what led authorities to the boy but juvenile proceedings have begun in federal court. 

Last Tuesday, investigators had said that Weise had acted alone and his motives were unknown though he suffered from depression and expressed interest in &lt;a href="w%3ANazism"&gt;Nazism&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>U.S. Supreme Court hears MGM v. Grokster</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=U.S.%20Supreme%20Court%20hears%20MGM%20v.%20Grokster&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Oral arguments in the landmark case of ♡❤MGM v. Grokster♡❤ legal battle were heard before the &lt;a href="w%3ASupreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;Supreme Court of the United States&lt;/a&gt; March 29. In the case, 28 entertainment companies have joined together to sue &lt;a href="w%3AStreamCast"&gt;StreamCast&lt;/a&gt;, maker of Morpheus software, and &lt;a href="w%3AGrokster"&gt;Grokster&lt;/a&gt;.

A final ruling is expected on the case within a few months. The issue heard before the court was an appeal of prior decisions made since 2001 at the U.S. district court level and from the &lt;a href="w%3ANinth%20Circuit%20Court%20of%20Appeals"&gt;Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals&lt;/a&gt;. Both of those decisions were in favor of Grokster's right to market its &lt;a href="w%3AP2P"&gt;P2P&lt;/a&gt; software.

P2P stands for peer-to-peer software, which uses the Internet as a medium for millions of users to distribute digital content, such as music, movies, books, and software, among themselves. By far the majority of the content distributed through this method is without the permission of the copyright holder.

Morpheus is one of the most-popular peer-to-peer software products worldwide. StreamCast also operates MusicCity.com. Lawyers from the &lt;a href="w%3AEFF"&gt;EFF&lt;/a&gt; Foundation (www.eff.org) are serving as defense counsel in the case.

The result of this case could determine the ultimate fate of P2P software in the U.S., whether it is legal for software companies to produce and sell software that, in the opinion of some, facilitates profit illegally from the trade in copyrighted materials. However, even if illegal in America, such software might still be widely available from international hosts due to technological limitations of enforcing such a ruling. The companies behind this effort are aiming to hold technological innovators legally responsible for infringing uses of their technology.

"About 36 million Americans — or 27 percent of internet users—say they download either music or video files and about half of them have found ways outside of traditional peer-to-peer networks or paid online services to swap their files". As a measure of public opinion on the issue, they stated, "49% of all Americans and 53% of internet users believe that the firms that own and operate file-sharing networks should be deemed responsible for the pirating of music and movie files," according to Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project in their most recent survey,

The landmark ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABetamax"&gt;Betamax&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ decision of 1984 (♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASony%20Corp.%20v.%20Universal%20City%20Studios"&gt;Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios&lt;/a&gt;♡❤) is the most relevant U.S. &lt;a href="w%3Acase%20law"&gt;case law&lt;/a&gt; in this matter (note: the precedent Betamax case supports the legality of P2P netowrks). A decision in the &lt;a href="w%3AMGM%20v.%20Grokster"&gt;MGM v. Grokster&lt;/a&gt; case could either affirm ♡❤Betamax♡❤, or overturn it. This is the case that essentially created the VCR market in America for distributing movies at home, and so in this modern technologically updated version, there are billions of dollars in future revenues now at stake.

A team of Australian surgeons yesterday reattached both hands and one foot to 10-year-old Perth boy, Terry Vo, after a brick wall which collapsed during a game of basketball fell on him, severing the limbs. The wall gave way while Terry performed a slam-dunk, during a game at a friend's birthday party.

The boy was today awake and smiling, still in some pain but in good spirits and expected to make a full recovery, according to plastic surgeon, Mr Robert Love.

"What we have is parts that are very much alive so the reattached limbs are certainly pink, well perfused and are indeed moving," Mr Love told reporters today.

"The fact that he is moving his fingers, and of course when he wakes up he will move both fingers and toes, is not a surprise," Mr Love had said yesterday.

"The question is more the sensory return that he will get in the hand itself and the fine movements he will have in the fingers and the toes, and that will come with time, hopefully. We will assess that over the next 18 months to two years.

"I'm sure that he'll enjoy a game of basketball in the future."

The weight and force of the collapse, and the sharp brick edges, resulted in the three limbs being cut through about 7cm above the wrists and ankle.

Terry's father Tan said of his only child, the injuries were terrible, "I was scared to look at him, a horrible thing."

The hands and foot were placed in an ice-filled Esky and rushed to hospital with the boy, where three teams of medical experts were assembled, and he was given a blood transfusion after experiencing massive blood loss. Eight hours of complex micro-surgery on Saturday night were followed by a further two hours of skin grafts yesterday.

"What he will lose because it was such a large zone of traumatised skin and muscle and so on, he will lose some of the skin so he'll certainly require lots of further surgery regardless of whether the skin survives," said Mr Love said today.

The boy was kept unconscious under anaesthetic between the two procedures. In an interview yesterday, Mr Love explained why:

"He could have actually been woken up the next day. Because we were intending to take him back to theatre for a second look, to look at the traumatised skin flaps, to close more of his wounds and to do split skin grafting, it was felt the best thing to do would be to keep him stable and to keep him anaesthetised."

Professor Wayne Morrison, director of the respected Bernard O'Brien Institute of Microsurgery and head of plastic and hand surgery at Melbourne's St Vincent's Hospital, said he believed the operation to be a world first.

A visit to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's "&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Zone"&gt;Green Zone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; " on two separate days last week (March 22 and 24, 2005) has convinced Washington's &lt;a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;Democratic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="US%20Senate"&gt;senators&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="US%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;representatives&lt;/a&gt; that things are going well.

The Senate delegation, led by Senator &lt;a href="Harry%20Reid"&gt;Harry Reid&lt;/a&gt; (D-Nev), visited on Tuesday. The House delegation, led by &lt;a href="Nancy%20Pelosi"&gt;Nancy Pelosi&lt;/a&gt; (D-San Francisco), visited two days later. They all came away from their whirlwind visits with opinions that although conditions were improving there would still be many years of American occupation before Iraq could be a true democracy.

"Although progress has been made, there is a significant way to go until the Iraqis are capable of providing for their security," said Pelosi, the House Democratic leader. She led an eight-member group that included seven Democrats and &lt;a href="Republican%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; Rep. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADarrell%20Issa"&gt;Darrell Issa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (R-Vista) (San Diego County).

The delegations spent their one day in Iraq's Green Zone, the heavily protected area in downtown Baghdad that serves as headquarters for the 150,000 U.S. military forces and diplomats and the Iraqi government. They headed to their other stops in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJordan"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEgypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Security was tight and didn’t allow for any additional travel in the war torn nation.

The sole Republican in the Congressional delegation, Issa, said "I believe it will be a fairly long stay."

Pelosi’s comments echoed Issa, and added "the cost of this war is huge to the American people," citing 1,500 service personnel the Bush administration has admitted were killed in action, and the estimated $500 million-a-day price tag. "The message some of us had for our military leaders and Iraqi leaders is that whatever it takes to transfer security responsibilities should be applied now. It's long overdue," she added.

An emotional trip to Beirut, Lebanon, by the congressional delegation included a visit to the grave of former Prime Minister &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARafik%20Hariri"&gt;Rafik Hariri&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who was assassinated in a Feb. 14 bombing that is blamed, but not substantiated, to have been committed by Syrian agents. Darrell Issa, of Lebanese descent, noted "there's a huge permanent group of mourners at his grave, with hundreds of tents set up.'’

Senator Reid stressed the need for continued U.S. support for reconstruction efforts, along with training Iraqi security forces to replace U.S. military personnel and help bolster the Iraqi economy and political structure. "Everyone understands that reconstruction is an important part of the U.S. mission here," he added.

Senate Minority Whip &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADick%20Durbin"&gt;Dick Durbin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (D-Ill.) agreed: "I believe what we are seeing here is good."

Senator &lt;a href="Barbara%20Boxer"&gt;Barbara Boxer&lt;/a&gt; (D-CA), a leading critic of the Bush administration's Iraq policy, seemed upbeat about the future of the new Iraq government. Iraq's future stability "greatly depends on the training of Iraqi security forces."

"We got a very, very upbeat report from the top U.S. military officials,” she added.

All of the delegation seemed to agree that their trip enforced the enormity of the challenge and the financial need to help the Iraqi people. This would require a continued input of American taxpayer dollars and left little doubt that they would line up to support the Bush administration’s proposed new $81 billion dollars (US) in expenditures there.

In anticipation of a &lt;a href="UN%20Security%20Council"&gt;Security Council&lt;/a&gt; vote on trying alleged Darfur war criminals at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Criminal%20Court"&gt;International Criminal Court&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Sudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt; announced today it would reject any &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; resolution that required war crimes suspects to be tried abroad. The resolution before the UNSC was drafted by the &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; delegation, and is expected to be voted on this week.

Sudanese foreign minister Mustafa Osman Ismail said, "Any resolution that is going to include the taking of a Sudanese &amp;mdash; whether he is a rebel or government official &amp;mdash; outside the Sudan: we are totally against it." In contrast, some rebel groups are in favor of the resolution. Tajeddin Nyam, of the rebel group "Justice and Equality of Movement," said he thought the resolution would contribute to peace.

Perhaps in an effort to avoid such extradition, Sudan has begun arresting officials in relation to &lt;a href="human%20rights"&gt;human rights&lt;/a&gt; abuses in Darfur. Government officials announced that 15 members of the military and security forces in Darfur had been arrested this week, and were to be sent immediately to local courts.

The region of Darfur has been the center of civil strife for over two years, during which time tens of thousands of people in the black African population have been killed, and many more wounded or abused, by government-supported Arab militias. It has often been suggested that this qualifies as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Agenocide"&gt;genocide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and that Darfur is enduring the world's most severe and localized abuse of civil rights.

&lt;a href="w%3AIsrali"&gt;Israel's&lt;/a&gt; parliament, the &lt;a href="w%3AKnesset"&gt;Knesset,&lt;/a&gt; voted against a bill calling for a referendum on &lt;a href="w%3AAriel%20Sharon"&gt;Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's&lt;/a&gt; controversial plan to withdraw Israeli forces and civilians from the Gaza Strip and some parts of the West Bank. The vote passed 72-39, with three abstentions and six absent. The vote removes the last major hurdle for Mr. Sharon to implement the proposed plan, scheduled to start in July.

Mr. Sharon's administration has not yet survived the upcoming vote on the 2005 budget, which takes place on Tuesday. But it has secured the support of the secular &lt;a href="w%3AShinui"&gt;Shinui&lt;/a&gt; party, so a majority looks likely. Shinui had reservations about the amount of money transferred under the budget to projects organised by ultra-Orthodox parties. Under Israeli law, if the budget fails to pass, new elections must be held. Opponents of the disengagement plan intend to use the budget vote to topple Mr. Sharon's government, and several MK's attacked Shinui for their decision to support the budget.

Mr. Sharon's position sparked a rebellion from his own center-right &lt;a href="w%3ALikud"&gt;Likud&lt;/a&gt; party, with a significant majority of Likud MKs voting in favour of the bill, including several members of his own cabinet. Finance Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom, Justice Minister Tzipi Livni, and Education Minister Limor Livnat all voted in favour of a referendum.

In a report from the &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Homeland%20Security"&gt;Department of Homeland Security&lt;/a&gt; released on Friday, March 25, they allege the US &lt;a href="w%3ATransportation%20Security%20Administration"&gt;Transportation Security Administration&lt;/a&gt; "made inaccurate statements" about its management of personal data belonging to passengers. The report claims, "TSA did not ensure that privacy protections were in place" as it handled data transfers to private contractors for use in the development of a computerized passenger screening application, called &lt;a href="w%3ACAPPS%20II"&gt;CAPPS II&lt;/a&gt;. While the report criticizes TSA for its inaccurate statements, it notes the "misstatements were apparently not meant to mischaracterize known facts," but were instead "premised on an incomplete understanding" of the truth.

According to the report, the data at issue described passengers flying on the following airlines: &lt;a href="w%3AAmerica%20West%20Airlines"&gt;America West Airlines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Airlines"&gt;American Airlines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AContinental%20Airlines"&gt;Continental Airlines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADelta%20Air%20Lines"&gt;Delta Air Lines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFrontier%20Airlines"&gt;Frontier Airlines&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AJetBlue%20Airways"&gt;JetBlue Airways&lt;/a&gt;. In most of the problematic transfers, the privacy violation occurred by allowing third parties to access passenger data that was not anonymized. In one case, passenger information was made public on the internet through a presentation prepared by Torch Concepts. According to the report, "
Torch Concepts' subsequent efforts to remove the presentation from the internet have failed."

In an ♡❤AP♡❤ report, ♡❤Yahoo! News♡❤ notes that TSA announced the launch of its "Secure Flight" system, saying, "Congress has said the agency can't proceed with Secure Flight unless the Government Accountability Office reports that the technology ensures privacy and that the data are protected." The report from the GAO was to be released Monday, March 27, 2005.

In response to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; Department of State issuing its annual ♡❤&lt;a href="http%3A//www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2004/"&gt;Country Reports on Human Rights Practices&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; has issued a contradictory report highlighting &lt;a href="w%3AHuman%20rights"&gt;human rights&lt;/a&gt; abuses in the US, ♡❤&lt;a href="http%3A//english.people.com.cn/200503/03/eng20050303_175406.html"&gt;The Human Rights Record of the United States in 2004&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

For the past six years, the People's Republic of China has issued an annual statement on human rights in the US in response to the annual report on China. "Only the Chinese people themselves have the right to comment on the human rights situation in their own country," said Liu Jianchao, spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry. 

The US State Department, beginning in 1977, issues annual country reviews of its perceptions of the rights records of individual nations, based on the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AUniversal%20Declaration%20of%20Human%20Rights"&gt;Universal Declaration of Human Rights&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. The current report for 2004, released on February 28, 2005, contains candid assessments and detailed criticism of the human rights records of 192 countries, including China. &lt;a href="w%3AAmnesty%20International"&gt;Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt;, the international 'watch-dog organization' for human rights, has however criticized this paper as being biased, because it is made by a government which itself is violating human rights on many sectors.

The Chinese response, was released on March 3, 2005. In this report, the Chinese government attempts to deflect criticism of itself by drawing attention to the various publicly documented shortcomings within US society, including statistics on crime, violent death, imprisonment, poverty, rape, child abuse, and racial and sexual discrimination that are an acknowledged and publicly documented part of life in the US.

Amnesty International's &lt;a href="http%3A//web.amnesty.org/report2004/usa-summary-eng"&gt;2004 annual report on US human rights in 2003&lt;/a&gt; agrees with many of these claims.

Amnesty is also worried about: severe violations committed by the United States' army outside the countries' borders; the situation of the prisoners in &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20Bay"&gt;Guantanamo Bay&lt;/a&gt;; United States' general misbehaviour against international peace; ill-treatment of US immigrants; ill-treatment and excessive use of force by the US law enforcement officials; the US citizens losing civil rights and liberties after the &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%2C%202001%20attacks"&gt;9/11 attacks&lt;/a&gt;; and continued use of death penalty by the state, which is in direct breach with the 3rd article of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;' ♡❤Universal Declaration of Human Rights♡❤ (the right to life).

Comment by Peter Edidin of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20New%20York%20Times"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, characterized the Chinese report as "a frank indictment [that] draws a picture of America that approaches caricature. But that doesn't mean it won't buttress the negative image of the United States held by its critics around the world."

This ongoing dispute does not capture the entire relationship of US and China on civil rights. Even as both sides trade accusations, the US on March 18, 2005, declined to table a resolution at the UN criticizing China, citing the ongoing improvements that are being made in that country. This is the second time in three years that the US has not submitted such a resolution, which in fact has never passed the UN when it was submitted before.

Although they may be unwilling participants, a group of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAllergy"&gt;allergic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; mice are helping solve a long-time conflict between cats and humans. Scientists from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUCLA"&gt;University of California, Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (UCLA) and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Institute%20of%20Allergy%20and%20Infectious%20Diseases"&gt;National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (NIAID) reported today in the scientific journal &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANature%20Medicine"&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that they have developed a technique that will one day lead to a cure for cat allergies.

The scientists have bred mice that were genetically engineered to be allergic to cats, and injected these mice with a special &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aprotein"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , derived from both cats and humans. Normally, when humans allergic to cats come in contact with a particular feline protein their body releases a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ahistamine"&gt;histamine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that causes the allergic reaction.

The newly developed protein is a fusion of cat protein with a human protein that normally acts as a brake on the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aimmune%20system"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The cat part stimulates an allergic reaction, but the human part suppresses the response and, in the process, resets the immune system.

After being treated with the protein, it took the mice a month to be cured.

According to experts, nearly one in every seven children are allergic to cats. However the scientists who made this discovery feel that their technique may also be adapted to cure other types of allergies, including food allergies. In some populations allergies affect a large number of people &amp;mdash; as many as 30% of all adults in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUK"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , for example.

The new cure is still in development stages, and will need years of animal and human testing before becoming commercially available.

A report released by Allan Gyngell of the Lowy Institute on Monday, revealed many &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;ns view &lt;a href="United%20States%20of%20America"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aforeign%20policy"&gt;foreign policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to be as dangerous as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIslamic%20fundamentalism"&gt;Islamic fundamentalism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . It also found that 58 percent of the population had a positive view of the United States. 

The Lowy Institute, established in 2003 with a $30 million endowment from Australian philanthropist &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFrank%20Lowy"&gt;Frank Lowy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , claims it is "an independent, non-partisan think tank."

The report, entitled "Australians speak 2005: public opinion and foreign policy", showed that &lt;a href="global%20warming"&gt;global warming&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="nuclear%20proliferation"&gt;nuclear proliferation&lt;/a&gt; were greater foreign policy concerns than terrorism and illegal immigration. 70 per cent of Australians were worried about global warming, the report stated, while only 63 per cent were worried about international terrorism. The report also noted most Australians believed improving the global environment should be Australia's number one foreign policy goal.

Mark Wakeham of &lt;a href="Greenpeace"&gt;Greenpeace&lt;/a&gt; said, "Clearly Australians understand the warnings from scientists about &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGreenhouse%20effect"&gt;greenhouse pollution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; far better than our governments do. Once again, the community is leading and governments will be pulled into line."

He continued by saying, "Scientists tell us that, to avoid dangerous warming of more than two degrees, we have to cut our greenhouse pollution by at least 60 per cent by 2050. This means moving rapidly and decisively away from dirty coal to clean, renewable sources of energy like solar, wind and energy efficiency."

The Lowy Institute surveyed 1000 randomly selected people to interview for the report.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Upper%20house%20of%20former%20Kyrgyz%20parliament%20steps%20down%2C%20Bakiyev%20pledges%20to%20fight%20corruption&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The upper house of the former &lt;a href="w%3AKyrgyzstan"&gt;Kyrgyz&lt;/a&gt; parliament declared it was terminating its work "to stabilize the situation and do away with conflicts" on Tuesday, as the lower house had done a day before.

The decision was signed by 32 of the 45 deputies. "We think we have fulfilled our task, as far as was possible, especially in this time of trials," they said.

Opposition leader and acting President and Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AKurmanbek%20Bakiyev"&gt;Kurmanbek Bakiyev&lt;/a&gt;, said the deputies "have made a historically correct decision." He called on everyone to accept the new parliament as legitimate "in the interest of the whole nation".

Bakiyev then delivered a 30-minute speech to about 300 civil servants, which was received with complete silence. He told them, "fighting corruption and paying pensions and benefits is our number one priority now."

"We need to deal with the economy ... A huge part of the state system was devoted to the election process. That is not a secret...We have all seen what happens when the executive branch gets involved in elections. I think we will not get into that now ... I think that staff should get back to work," he said.

"Whoever is ... on my staff, if I hear that they got promoted for money or because they are someone's relative, or they belong to particular clan, then this person will be removed immediately," he added.

"We will set up public hotline so that people can complain against corruption," he told them.

Meanwhile, deposed president &lt;a href="w%3AAskar%20Akayev"&gt;Askar Akayev&lt;/a&gt;'s supporters said they would form a party and run a candidate in the presidential poll.

Ousted emergencies minister Timirbek Akmataliyev and interior minister Keshenbek Dyushenbayev said they were forming the Akyikat (Fairness) political party. Akmataliyev said he would run for president in June.

The two called for Akayev to return to Kyrgyzstan and formally resign. "Askar Akayev has to come back to the republic and answer for his actions in front of the people, after which he must immediately resign," Akmataliyev said.

Shortages of &lt;a href="w%3Abeef"&gt;beef&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; prompted consumers to submit a petition with about 1.19 million signatures to Japan's Agriculture Minister Yoshinobu Shimamura on Tuesday. The petition was presented by a group led by Takashi Sakamoto, president of a chain of used book outlets.

Japan has banned imports of &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; beef for 15 months, citing concerns about &lt;a href="w%3Amad%20cow%20disease"&gt;mad cow disease&lt;/a&gt; after authorities discovered a cow with the disease in the United States.

Japanese health and agriculture ministers said they would ask their country's food safety commission to approve lifting the ban.

"We will ask the commission to decide if resuming U.S. beef imports is safe based on safety measures taken in the U.S.," said health minister Makoto Kanie.

Analyst Kazuhiko Saito says this may cause a delay "until later this year", telling ♡❤Bloomberg♡❤, "The Commission has been very slow on reviewing domestic mad cow tests and will also be slow to review the U.S. beef import plans."

U.S. lawmakers and diplomats have pressed Japan to re-open their market, and some Washington lawmakers have even threatened Japan with sanctions should beef imports not resume soon. &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Secretary%20of%20State"&gt;US Secretary of State&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACondoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; brought up the matter earlier this month during her visit to Japan.

So far, the Japan Food Safety Commission has only taken the step of loosening inspection rules, such that mad cow testing is not required for all imported live cattle.

Japan has dealt with 14 cases of mad cow disease of their own.

Did we need to take a poll to find out how well America sleeps at night? Probably not, but the results of the poll offer a worrisome picture about our problems getting a good night’s sleep.

The &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ANational%20Sleep%20Foundation"&gt;National Sleep Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, the poll sponsor, reports three-quarters of adults say they frequently have a sleep problem, such as waking during the night or snoring. The average adult gets less than the recommended seven to nine hours of uninterrupted sleep each night. This leads to poorer health, lower productivity on the job, more danger on the roads and a less vibrant sex life. One-fourth admit their sleep problems do have an impact on their daily lives.

Becky Mcerien, 50, in Philadelphia, told a reporter "By 3 to 4 in the afternoon, I'm starting to feel brain-drained and I need that caffeine to pick me back up again,"

But Guillermo Sardina, 55, of Hamilton, N.J., said "I sleep through the night. I'm a sound sleeper. I don't even remember my dreams." He averages six or seven hours a night.

Darwin McCallian, 51, of Burke, Va., rises at 4 a.m. to get a jump on traffic for his commute to Washington, DC. He usually gets six to eight hours of sleep.

"When I sleep in a little bit longer, it makes me a safer driver," McCallian noted.

Sleep Foundation CEO, Richard Gelula, said the link between sleep and quality of life is strong. It affects professional relationships and takes a serious toll on personal interactions and intimacies:

<ul>
BULLET::::- Six in 10 adult motorists said they have driven while drowsy in the past year; 4 percent reported that they have had an accident or near-accident because they were too tired or actually fell asleep while driving.
BULLET::::- Three-fourths said their partner has a sleep problem, and the most common is snoring.
BULLET::::- Roughly one-fourth of respondents who have partners report that their sexual relationship has been hurt because they have been too sleepy. They had sex less often or lost interest in having sex because they were too tired.
BULLET::::- Seven in 10 people said their doctor has never asked them about their sleep.
</ul>
They recommend avoiding alcohol and caffeine close to bedtime, and that adults pay attention to how much sleep they get as well as the quality of that sleep, and seek help if needed.

A &lt;a href="w%3Alorry"&gt;lorry&lt;/a&gt; spilt thirteen tonnes of raw fish on a road in the small British town of &lt;a href="w%3AShaftesbury"&gt;Shaftesbury&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADorset"&gt;Dorset&lt;/a&gt;, earlier today.

Crates of iced fish, worth £80,000, apparently burst out the rear doors of the lorry as it climbed a hill.

The BBC reports Dorset Police as saying "It appears as the lorry started its ascent up the hill the load in the rear of the articulated container slipped backwards, probably on the wet floor, and the weight of the fish on the rear doors forced the doors open."

The clean-up was hampered by poor weather conditions as Dorset County Council struggled to use a digger and a second lorry to clear the fish.

The &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Football%20League"&gt;Canadian Football League&lt;/a&gt; released details today concerning the June 11 &lt;a href="w%3Aexhibition%20game"&gt;exhibition game&lt;/a&gt; dubbed Touchdown Atlantic between the &lt;a href="w%3AToronto"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AToronto%20Argonauts"&gt;Argonauts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AHamilton%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Hamilton&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AHamilton%20Tiger-Cats"&gt;Tiger-Cats&lt;/a&gt; at Huskies Stadium in &lt;a href="w%3AHalifax%2C%20Nova%20Scotia"&gt;Halifax&lt;/a&gt;, . The game is planned as a gauge for expansion east to an &lt;a href="w%3AAtlantic%20Canada"&gt;Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; city but with ticket prices at $40 and $62.50 (&lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20dollar"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt;), CFL commissioner Tom Wright admitted they were considerably more expensive than the average price for other season-ticket holder single games which, he said, is "in the mid to high $20 range".

At the news conference in Halifax, Wright defended the prices as necessary to break-even with the additional costs required to set-up the game and temporarily expand Huskies Stadium from 2 000 to 10 000 seats and comparable to similar, one-time events.

Events Halifax chairman Fred MacGillivray said he is confident that the showcase game will be a success. "I think the general public's reaction to this event will tell the CFL that there are a lot of people in the &lt;a href="w%3AMaritimes"&gt;Maritimes&lt;/a&gt; who want to see CFL &lt;a href="w%3Afootball"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; and we feel very confident we'll have a full house for that event in June", he told the news conference.

Hamilton &lt;a href="w%3Ahead%20coach"&gt;head coach&lt;/a&gt; Greg Marshall agreed and said he thinks expansion to Halifax is viable. "Halifax is the natural site and it's just a matter of coming up with the facility", he said. "I think there's a lot of interest here and I think there's a lot of interest in the CFL to put a team here."

Events Halifax and the CFL have also set up a number of events surrounding the game including a Friday-night &lt;a href="w%3Akickoff"&gt;kickoff&lt;/a&gt; party, a schools program, open team practices with player autograph opportunities and a pre-game festival.

CFL fans watch with interest how ticket sales will do when they go on sale on April 8 as the league considers expansion in 2008.

The local chapter of the &lt;a href="w%3APhi%20Kappa%20Tau"&gt;Phi Kappa Tau&lt;/a&gt; fraternity at &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%20State%20University%2C%20Chico"&gt;California State University, Chico&lt;/a&gt; was suspended after members were linked to a &lt;a href="w%3APornographic%20movie"&gt;pornographic DVD&lt;/a&gt; apparently filmed in the club's fraternity house. According to reports, the DVD shows students engaged in various sexual activities with female porn actresses.

The Chico fraternity also has been suspended by the national Phi Kappa Tau organization and Chico State's Interfraternity Council, the student governing body for all fraternities. In addition, the national Interfraternity Council issued a press statement saying it was embarrassed by the Chico group's actions.

The company responsible for making the porno film is -based Shane's World. A spokesman for Shane's World said the Chico fraternity contacted it months ago with the idea of making a sex film in its "College Invasion" series.

The company says it requires all students who participate in its sex films to show proof that they are 18 or older and sign release forms. Shane's World has made five other DVDs at other U.S. universities since 2000.

University officials suspended the local fraternity from being able to participate in school sponsored activities at the rural northern California campus. The school also is investigating whether any illegal activities happened during the porn shoot including underage drinking.

Although &lt;a href="Magnitude%208.7%20earthquake%20hits%20Northern%20Sumatra%2C%20Indonesia"&gt;Monday night's quake&lt;/a&gt; off &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;, at 8.7 on the &lt;a href="w%3ARichter%20magnitude%20scale"&gt;Richter scale&lt;/a&gt;, was one of the ten largest in the past 100 years, the death toll has been relatively few. Damage was also less than expected, and the feared &lt;a href="w%3ATsunami"&gt;tsunami&lt;/a&gt; never eventuated. But 430 are confirmed dead, with aid workers guessing a final toll of 1,000 to 2,000.

Over 270,000 died following last year's &lt;a href="2004%20Indian%20Ocean%20Tsunami"&gt;December 26, 9.0-Richter quake and tsunami&lt;/a&gt;, prompting alarm when such a large quake struck on Monday night. Mass evacuations and alerts turned out to be unnecessary, when the potential hazard of a tidal wave failed to arise.

Initially Indonesian Vice-President Yusuf Kalla put the number of dead at the island of Nias, near the quake's epicentre, at up to 2,000. But officials who flew over the area said the damage could be less than expected.

Indonesian National Coordinating Disaster Relief Agency said only 330 were so far confirmed dead at Nias, with a further 100 coming from another island, Simeuleu, according to the head of the health office in Aceh province, Mulya Hasjmy, and numbers expected to rise as workers further explore the rubble.

The quake occurred offshore, with its centre around 205km west of Sibolga on &lt;a href="w%3ASumatra"&gt;Sumatra&lt;/a&gt; island, and 245km southwest of Sumatran city Medan, about 320km from that of the quake which caused December's tsunami.

&lt;a href="w%3AOxfam"&gt;Oxfam&lt;/a&gt; aid workers at Gunung Sitoli, the main town on Nias, described the scene. "The water system has failed completely and huge holes have been made in the roads," said Alessandra Villas-Boas. "Bodies are being pulled from the rubble as I speak."

President &lt;a href="w%3ASusilo%20Bambang%20Yudhoyono"&gt;Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono&lt;/a&gt; has declared a state of emergency, and is to visit Nias today. The airport there was found to be intact, patients were receiving medical treatment already, and a field hospital was in the process of being erected on mainland.

SciScoop, the online collaborative science news source, has changed ownership after two and a half years of operation under its previous webmaster, Ricky James. An earlier report by Wikinews that the site would be shut down was in error.

James cited lack of time as the reason to pass on ownership of the site, which specializes in breaking news in science and technology. The site has a growing membership and gets more than 30,000 hits a day.

SciScoop headlines are also carried on &lt;a href="w%3ASlashdot"&gt;Slashdot&lt;/a&gt; and by the &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; newsfeed. The site has a burgeoning archive containing hundreds of searchable news stories, providing visitors with an invaluable record of science news over the past few years. SciScoop also allows members to customise the layout of pages at their whim and add functions to their personal page, such as RSS newsfeeds.

The new owner and maintainer of the site is science writer David Bradley, who also operates the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.sciencebase.com/"&gt;sciencebase science news site&lt;/a&gt;. Bradley is currently formulating a mission statement for the SciScoop site but has already said in a statement that, "The site is not going to disappear, nor is it going to change so radically that you won't recognise it."

<h1>UN Secretary General Annan cleared of influencing oil-for-food contracts by Volcker report</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=UN%20Secretary%20General%20Annan%20cleared%20of%20influencing%20oil-for-food%20contracts%20by%20Volcker%20report&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
UN Secretary General &lt;a href="w%3AKofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt; has been cleared of wrongdoing in an investigation of charges that he influenced the UN to award aid-screening contracts in Iraq to Swiss company Cotecna Inspection Services, which employed his son &lt;a href="w%3AKojo%20Annan"&gt;Kojo Annan&lt;/a&gt;. The investigation was led by former US Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, who said that the investigation initiated by Kofi Annan should instead have been referred to UN's independent watchdog agency. The report issued was called by the secretary general a "second interim report" in his statement reported in the New Zealand Herald. The commission will issue its final report in the northern hemisphere summer of 2005.

While Kofi Annan was exonerated, two of his staff members, Iqbal Riza and Dileep Nair, were criticized by the report. Riza allegedly shredded documents related to the contracts under investigation after the secretary general ordered that they be retained. The New York Times said that Nair was "faulted for appointing a person to a high-level post with oil-for-food responsibilities who did almost no work on the program".

According to the New York Times, the Secretary General said "I am deeply saddened by the evidence to the contrary that has emerged, and particularly by the fact that my son had failed to cooperate fully with the inquiry". The Guardian reports that Annan's son concealed from his father the fact that Cotecna continued to pay him for 6 years after "he left Cotecna in 1998". It was not clear from the Guardian report why Cotecna was paying Kojo Annan if he had indeed left the company.

Asked whether he planned to step down as Secretary General, as called for by US Republican Senator Norm Coleman, among others, Kofi Annan responded, "Hell, no!" according to Ewen MacAskill of the Guardian, as well as an unattributed Sydney Morning Herald article. Senator Coleman continued to press forward with his criticism of Annan and calls for his resignation despite the report's findings.

<h1>Three Romanian journalists abducted in Iraq</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Three%20Romanian%20journalists%20abducted%20in%20Iraq&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
Three &lt;a href="Romania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;n journalists were abducted in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; shortly after Romanian President &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ATraian%20Basescu"&gt;Traian Băsescu&lt;/a&gt; visited the country to meet with the Romanian troops deployed there. The journalists went missing Monday, and have been identified as reporter Marie Jeanne Ion, cameraman Sorin Dumitru Miscoci and reporter Ovidiu Ohanesian. Miscoci and Ion were both from the television station Prima TV, which had been in Baghdad for five days to conduct interviews with Prime Minister &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AIyad%20Allawi"&gt;Iyad Allawi&lt;/a&gt; and interim President &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AGhazi%20al-Yawer"&gt;Ghazi al-Yawer&lt;/a&gt;. Ohanesian was an investigative reporter from the Bucharest-based 'România liberă' newspaper, and was scheduled to return to Romania this weekend.

The three journalists were abducted from a street next to the Flowerland Hotel, in the upscale Jadriya neighborhood, where they were staying. A hotel employee stated that the abduction occurred at approximately 20:30 on Monday. Prima TV also confirmed that it lost contact with the crew at 19:45 on Monday, and that Ion and Miscoci were probably kidnapped by a rebel group from Baghdad's al-Mansur district.

<h2>Kidnapping confirmed</h2>

The kidnapping was confirmed as Marie Jeanne Ion made a phone call to the Prima TV newsroom shortly after she was abducted, speaking a mixture of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARomanian%20language"&gt;Romanian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEnglish%20language"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AArabic%20language"&gt;Arabic&lt;/a&gt;. She told her colleagues to call the Romanian Embassy in Baghdad for help. Voices of men, seemingly angry and shouting in Arabic, could be heard in the background. A few minutes later, Ion sent an &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AShort%20Message%20Service"&gt;SMS&lt;/a&gt; message from her mobile phone to Prima TV, saying "Help, this is not a joke, we've been kidnapped. Help!"

Dan Dumitru, the news director at Prima TV, told another television station, Realitatea TV, "All I know [is that] they have been taken by force and we can't reach them any more." Ohanesian, the reporter from 'România liberă', could not be contacted, even though his colleagues in Bucharest tried ringing his mobile phone, which was switched off.

<h2>Romanian authorities promise action</h2>

President &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ATraian%20Basescu"&gt;Traian Băsescu&lt;/a&gt;, who has just returned from a surprise visit to Iraq, said on Monday night that "All the state structures are on alert and determined to resolve the disappearance of the three journalists." He also said that Romania has sought the help of the US-led coalition authorities in Iraq.

Romanian Prime Minister &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ACalin%20Popescu%20Tariceanu"&gt;Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu&lt;/a&gt; confirmed the kidnapping on Tuesday morning, while on Monday evening he claimed that it was unclear what had happened to the three abducted journalists, and that no-one had contacted the Romanian government or authorities demanding a ransom. He went on to say that the journalists went missing in an upscale district that is only known for low-level crime, and that there is consequently a "ray of hope" that their abduction is not serious. However, Tăriceanu said that a special crisis unit was created inside the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to solve the abduction problem. The unit will make use of all necessary state institutions, including Romanian and foreign intelligence agencies.

<h2>Abduction could soften Romania's stance on Iraq</h2>

Romania currently has one of the world's largest contingents in Iraq, with more than 800 troops. During his visit to Baghdad on the weekend, President Băsescu said that he does not want to reduce the troop contingent and that Romania "will continue to take part in the reconstruction and stabilization missions in Iraq." Romania also announced that it will be sending 100 troops for peacekeeping purposes soon. This news comes in a time when most other countries in Europe have considered recalling their troops.

Until now, the Romanian presence in Iraq has not been as controversial as in other countries, mainly because no Romanian troops have died in Iraq. However, the abduction of the three journalists, announced on Monday, is expected to result in a decline of public support for the war, especially since 55% of Romanians are opposed to Romania's contribution to the war, after an opinion poll conducted in Bucharest on Monday. This is expect to result in authorities in reducing their plans for a stronger Romanian military presence in Iraq.

Romanian political analyst Stelian Tănase said, "It will be a shock for the public. It is the first time something like this has happened. If Romanian authorities aren't able to free the journalists, it will harm the support that Băsescu enjoys."

<h2>French government send their sympathies</h2>

The French authorities were the first government to sent their sympathies to the Romanian people in regards to the abduction of the three journalists. The spokesperson of the &lt;a href="w%3AMinister%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%20%28France%29"&gt;French Ministry of Foreign Affairs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMichel%20Barnier"&gt;Michel Barnier&lt;/a&gt;, said "Romania can be sure of France's understanding." In response to whether Romania and France will collaborate on this case, M. Barnier said, "We will see if there is a request from the Romanian authorities." French journalists have also fallen victim to Iraqi rebels. Florence Aubenas, a French journalist, and her Iraqi guide were kidnapped in January 5 of this year, and have not yet been found.

In a surprise announcement, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; First Lady &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALaura%20Bush"&gt;Laura Bush&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; flew to &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; for a 5-hour stay today. Bush has desired to take this trip for a number of years, but it has been delayed for security reasons. Security is still a concern &amp;mdash; the trip was only announced as she was about to depart from Andrews Air Force base near &lt;a href="Washington%2C%20DC"&gt;Washington, DC&lt;/a&gt;.

Bush told reporters, "I have been so looking forward to going to Afghanistan. When I really realized the plight of the women under the &lt;a href="Afghan%20Taliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt;, I also found that American women really stand in solidarity with the women in Afghanistan." 

Bush would arrive in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKabul"&gt;Kabul&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on Wednesday, and spend most of her short stay at the Women's Teacher Training Institute learning about education for women in Afghanistan. She also planned to meet with the country's women who run "micro-enterprises" making rugs and scarves. Education Secretary Margaret Spellings came with Bush on this trip.

<h1>German retail giant Rewe to open Penny Market stores in Romania</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=German%20retail%20giant%20Rewe%20to%20open%20Penny%20Market%20stores%20in%20Romania&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
German retail corporation Rewe plans to open several Penny Market discount stores in &lt;a href="Romania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; in the middle of this year. Rewe is mainly interested in opening stores in cities such as Ploieşti, Câmpina, Tecuci, Focşani, Oneşti, Craiova, Caracal, Constanţa, Medgidia, Alexandria and Roşiori de Vede. Most of these cities have populations of below 100,000 people, and Rewe is hoping to take advantage of a market that has not been highly tapped into, since most of Romania's larger cities, such as &lt;a href="Bucharest"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt;, Cluj-Napoca and Iaşi, already have multiple large supermarkets and discount stores.

Rewe also announced that, over the next few years, it intends to open a total of 50 Penny Market and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AXXL%20%28supermarket%29"&gt;XXL Mega Stores&lt;/a&gt; in Romania. Rewe already operates 14 several highly-successful Billa supermarkets throughout Romania, mainly in large cities, as well as 8 Selgros stores. Rewe has previously made announcements that it wishes to expand its Billa and Selgros brands more extensively. The total value of the company's investment in Romania is around 200 million euro.

Romania is currently going through a retail boom, especially in the supermarket and discount stores area. Large corporations such as Rewe and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ACarrefour"&gt;Carrefour&lt;/a&gt; have established very successful branches in Romania, and other retail giants such as &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ATesco"&gt;Tesco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Walmart"&gt;WalMart&lt;/a&gt; have announced their intention to enter the Romanian market, which is the largest in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASoutheastern%20Europe"&gt;Southeastern Europe&lt;/a&gt;.

The ♡❤mini MAX discount♡❤ company said it would open three stores in Romania, in April-May of this year, in the cities of Slatina, Târgovişte and Urziceni. It plans to open up to 100 stores until the year 2010. Meanwhile, Tengelmann, Rewe's rival, said it would invest 200 million euro in Romania to open 120 supermarkets in the next five years.

&lt;a href="w%3AJaap%20de%20Hoop%20Scheffer"&gt;Jaap de Hoop Scheffer&lt;/a&gt;, Secretary General of &lt;a href="w%3ANATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; has praised &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;'s role in providing security, and aiding with reconstruction in &lt;a href="w%3AAfghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;. He made the comments in &lt;a href="w%3AWellington"&gt;Wellington&lt;/a&gt; during a three-day visit of New Zealand.

"The fact that we are in Afghanistan, and that we see New Zealand participation in Afghanistan is proof that we are fighting this fight together," said Mr. Scheffer.

After talking with Mr. Scheffer, Prime Minister &lt;a href="Helen%20Clark"&gt;Helen Clark&lt;/a&gt; said "Later this year when the parliamentary elections are held in Afghanistan, the Bonn process will have run its course. We need to start talking with our partners in Nato, in the Afghanistan Government itself, about what is the post-Bonn process." 

Mr. Scheffer is scheduled for further talks with the Prime Minister, as well as other ministers and officials Wednesday. On Thursday he will address Victoria University's Institute of Policy Studies and the Institute of International Affairs. He is the first head of NATO to visit New Zealand.

Mr. Scheffer will leave on Thursday for &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; and then &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="Brazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;ian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva met the leaders of &lt;a href="Colombia"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Venezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href="w%3ACiudad%20Guyana"&gt;Ciudad Guyana&lt;/a&gt;, 500 km (311 miles) from &lt;a href="w%3ACaracas"&gt;Caracas&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href="w%3AVenezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;, Tuesday, March 29.

The regional summit aimed to improve the diplomatic relations between &lt;a href="w%3AColombia"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt; and Venezuela, that had been shaken after the arrest of the &lt;a href="w%3AFARC"&gt;FARC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACommunism"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; member Rodrigo Granda, in December, last year.

The following leaders were present at the meeting: the President of Colombia, &lt;a href="w%3AAlvaro%20Uribe"&gt;Álvaro Uribe Velez&lt;/a&gt;, the Spanish Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9%20Luis%20Rodr%C3%ADguez%20Zapatero"&gt;José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero&lt;/a&gt;, the President of Venezuela &lt;a href="w%3AHugo%20Ch%C3%A1vez"&gt;Hugo Chávez&lt;/a&gt;, and the President of &lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ALuiz%20In%C3%A1cio%20Lula%20da%20Silva"&gt;Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva&lt;/a&gt;.

During the summit, the Brazilian president defended the Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez and he criticized indirectly the government of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; for his opinions in relation to Chávez. According to Lula, &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20America"&gt;South America&lt;/a&gt; is capable of taking care of its own problems.

Lula said: "We do not accept defamations against our "companheiros" (comrades). We do not accept insinuations against comrades. Venezuela has the right to be a sovereign country, to take its own decisions". Lula also added that he is not afraid of doing this affirmation in "any place of the world".

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Defense"&gt;US Secretary of Defense&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADonald%20Rumsfeld"&gt;Donald Rumsfeld&lt;/a&gt;, was in Brazil on March 22 and he said that he was very worried about the political situation in Venezuela. Venezuela is buying weapons and warlike material in great quantity and Washington is considering the country a harmful influence in the region. Recently Venezuela announced that it would buy 100,000 AK-47 rifles.

Lula also said:"I believe that Venezuela has the right to be a sovereign country, of making its own decisions and, at the same time, Venezuela does not need to be accused of things that those who are with you know that this is not part of your thought nor of your behavior."

"There is many people talking badly about us in the world", he added.

The Venezuelan President did a calmer speech for the US: "We are not here to cause problems to anybody, for any reason. We were called to form this new geopolitical map, without confrontation with nobody (...) because it is convenient for us and all: it is convenient for the investors, for international businessmen, for national businessmen and for the United States themselves."

Chávez and Lula both denied any involvement between their governments and the FARC guerrilla.

The Spanish Prime Minister, José Luis Zapatero said: "This is a meeting for the dialogue and the cooperation between free and democratic nations that want the advance of their people".

A resident of &lt;a href="w%3ASchaumburg"&gt;Schaumburg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIllinois"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt; in the () was severely injured by an industrial punch press machine on Monday. He died an hour later.

Elk Grove Village police said William Naras, 48, was operating the machine at a local metal manufacturing plant when he became pinned by an I-beam, or metal arm, about 4 p.m. He was transported to Alexian Brothers Medical Center in Elk Grove Village where medics pronounced him dead at 4:51 p.m.

A survey carried out by &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20Wales"&gt;BBC Wales&lt;/a&gt; has revealed that the contents of a school meal in Wales cost on average just £0.49 per pupil. Average spending on meal ingredients varied slightly from council to council; with the &lt;a href="w%3ACardiff"&gt;Cardiff City&lt;/a&gt; council spending just £0.40 on each meal, whilst &lt;a href="w%3APowys"&gt;Powys&lt;/a&gt; council lavished £0.69 per pupil.

The survey follows a recent surge in media coverage of the eating habits of teenagers and children in the UK. Celebrity chef &lt;a href="w%3AJamie%20Oliver"&gt;Jamie Oliver&lt;/a&gt; recently embarked on a campaign to improve food standards and raise awareness in schools. In response to his campaign the government has promised to spend an additional £280 million over three years on school food in &lt;a href="w%3AEngland"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;.

The survey covered twenty councils throughout Wales.

Ebner Anivel Rivera-Paz, A leader of the vicious Mara Salvatruchas(MS-13) gang, has issued orders from his prison cell for his followers to teach the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; "Minutemen" volunteers a lesson when they begin patrolling the &lt;a href="Mexico"&gt;Mexican&lt;/a&gt; border tomorrow. 
MS-13 gang members are considered to be America's most violent gang with such acts of barbarism as to "cut off the testicles of their enemies and feed them to their vicious dogs" and "cut the heads off their opponents to play soccer with them". However, such allegations of brutality doesn't seem to frighten the "Minutemen" who are a group of Americans who are organizing more than 1,000 volunteers to patrol the Arizona-Mexico border beginning April 1st. They have been called vigilantes by Presidents &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Vicente%20Fox"&gt;Fox&lt;/a&gt; and sometimes sarcastically refer to themselves as "undocumented border patrol agents". James Gilchrist, a Vietnam veteran and spokesman for the minutemen in response to the MS-13 threat; "We're not worried because half of our recruits are retired trained combat soldiers..they(MS-13) are just a bunch of punks."

MS-13 gang now has about 20,000 members nationwide and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), has begun to focus on the gang with an initiative they call "Operation Community Shield". The very existence of MS-13 is considered by the Conservative Voice to be a direct consequence of the USA government's 1980's policies in Central America; "the chickens are coming home to roost.Its(MS-13) members are the sons of immigrants from El Salvador and other Central American countries that were forced to flee because of the CIA instigated war during the Reagan Administration that completely destroyed the physical, economic, social, religious and cultural infrastructure of the region. MS-13 was founded in Los Angeles by the offspring of the immigrants for protection."

British computer magazine ♡❤PC Pro♡❤ has investigated the electricity costs of running today's computers.

Their investigations showed that an individual could save £250 a year while a medium-sized business could potentially save £5,000 a year by making changes to the way computers and their peripherals are operated.

A CRT monitor uses £150 of electricity over five years; enough to pay for a new low-power LCD monitor. Using a screen saver, rather than turning the monitor off or using many computers' built-in feature to turn monitors off after a period of inactivity, could cost £100 alone in a year.

It was also discovered that turning a single laser printer off overnight and on weekends would save £70 over the life of the printer.

Many others computer users however run 'distributed computing' projects while their computers are idle, such as the '@home' series of projects (including the well-known 'SETI@home').

<h1>Taiwan Nationalists leader visits Beijing</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Taiwan%20Nationalists%20leader%20visits%20Beijing&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
A delegation of from the &lt;a href="w%3AKuomintang"&gt;Chinese Kuomintang (KMT, or Nationalist Party)&lt;/a&gt;, is meeting with &lt;a href="w%3ACommunist%20Party%20of%20China"&gt;Communist Party of China (CPC)&lt;/a&gt; officials in &lt;a href="w%3ABeijing"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt; today, led by KMT Vice Chairman &lt;a href="w%3AChiang%20Pin-kung"&gt;Chiang Pin-kung&lt;/a&gt;.

"We hope the current crisis can be minimized," Chiang said in Beijing. "After the anti-secession law was enacted we saw reactions and protests," he continued, "The Beijing authorities have likely heard it for themselves but we have also brought the voice of the &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan"&gt;Taiwanese&lt;/a&gt; people with us."

<h3>Banquet and meeting</h3>
Chen Yunlin, director of the &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan%20Affairs%20Office"&gt;Taiwan Affairs Office&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt;, hosted Chiang at a banquet in Beijing's Diaoyutai State Guesthouse. Chen characterized the delegation's visit as opening "party to party dialogue" and that the visit "has inaugurated the first sign of a dialogue between your Party and our Party."

Wednesday evening, Chen met with the delegation to discuss cross-&lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan%20Strait"&gt;Straits&lt;/a&gt; economic ties. Representatives from numerous other Chinese agencies were also present at the meeting, including the Ministries of Agriculture and Commerce, and the General Administration of Civil Aviation. The meeting discussed the possibility of opening up Taiwan to tourists from the mainland.

Zhu Peikang, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the mainland's &lt;a href="w%3ARevolutionary%20Committee%20of%20the%20Kuomintang"&gt;Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang&lt;/a&gt;, also welcomed the Nationalist delegation.

Zhu said Chiang's visit was important, and "focused on the common interests of the people on both sides and the promotion of the cross-Straits exchanges and cooperation."

<h3>Visit to Nanjing</h3>

Earlier in the day, Chiang was in &lt;a href="w%3ANanjing"&gt;Nanjing&lt;/a&gt;, to lay a wreath at the tomb of his party's founder, &lt;a href="w%3ASun%20Yat-sen"&gt;Sun Yat-sen&lt;/a&gt;. He also signed a guest book at the former Nationalists presidential office with the line, "Icebreaking journey."

"My heart was filled with limitless excitement and deep emotion," Chiang told the &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;♡❤Associated Press♡❤&lt;/a&gt;. "It was very moving to visit."

Nanjing was the former capital used by the Nationalists before they lost the &lt;a href="w%3ACivil%20war"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href="w%3ACommunist%20Party%20of%20China"&gt;Communists&lt;/a&gt; and evacuated to Taiwan in &lt;a href="w%3A1949"&gt;1949&lt;/a&gt;.

<h3>Reaction</h3>
In Taiwan, &lt;a href="w%3AJoseph%20Wu"&gt;Joseph Wu&lt;/a&gt;, chairman of the &lt;a href="w%3AMainland%20Affairs%20Council"&gt;Mainland Affairs Council&lt;/a&gt;, condemned the visit by the Nationalist delegation to the mainland.

"The Chinese strategy is always divide and conquer, and the KMT is playing into China's hands," he told &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20New%20York%20Times"&gt;♡❤The New York Times♡❤&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Herald%20Tribune"&gt;♡❤International Herald Tribune♡❤&lt;/a&gt; reporters. "It's very odd that they would cooperate with the Communist Party instead of the ruling party here on Taiwan," Wu said.

Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Michael Ying-mao Kau disclosed that the United States is concerned about the Nationalist visit, and that American officials have privately said that Taiwan's political parties should first unify and build a consensus to strengthen their negotiating position with mainland China.

Hundreds of demonstrators have taken to the streets of cities across &lt;a href="Egypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt; to protest against a possible fifth term of President &lt;a href="Hosni%20Mubarak"&gt;Hosni Mubarak&lt;/a&gt;.

Activists are campaigning to prevent Mubarak from gaining another term after 24 years in power. They are also calling for his son Gamal not to stand in elections in September and also that reforms are made to the &lt;a href="Constitution%20of%20Egypt"&gt;country's constitution&lt;/a&gt;.

Hundreds of Kifaya ("Enough") protesters were met by thousands of riot police in &lt;a href="Cairo"&gt;Cairo&lt;/a&gt; and were prevented from reaching the parliament buildings. Protests in &lt;a href="Alexandria"&gt;Alexandria&lt;/a&gt; were called off after security forces sealed off all routes in to the area of the planned protest. People later said that the police allowed a pro-Mubarak rally shortly afterwards.

The security chief of Cairo has stated that the police will no longer tolerate such protests. He is quoted by BBC News as saying "If we are getting to the stage of getting used to violating [the rules], then the principle is that legal regulations must be implemented." Street demonstrations have been illegal since laws were enacted after the 1981 assassination of President Anwar Sadat.

One leader of Kifaya was reported as saying the large deployment of security personnel had turned Cairo into "a military zone".

Entertainment industry rising star &lt;a href="w%3AGail%20Berman"&gt;Gail Berman&lt;/a&gt; was named president of the &lt;a href="w%3AViacom"&gt;Viacom&lt;/a&gt;-owned &lt;a href="w%3AParamount%20Pictures"&gt;Paramount Pictures&lt;/a&gt; film and television studios Wednesday. She is scheduled to start in May. Currently Berman heads up the programming division of the U.S. &lt;a href="w%3AFox%20Broadcasting%20Company"&gt;Fox network&lt;/a&gt;.

Berman is credited for the major turn-around in the fortunes of the Fox network. Their ratings were at the bottom of the heap of the four major U.S. broadcast networks when she took over programming in 2000. According to the latest Nielsen ratings, Fox is the No. 1 U.S. network in primetime programming, thanks to such hits as ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Idol"&gt;American Idol&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, real-time suspense drama, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3A24%20%28television%29"&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, and hit teen soap opera, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20O.C."&gt;The O.C.&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

In moving from television to the movies, Berman acknowledged to reporters that she faces a challenging learning curve. She replaces outgoing Paramount president, Donald DeLine.

The owners of the Noodle House Restaurant of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACharlottetown"&gt;Charlottetown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Prince%20Edward%20Island"&gt;Prince Edward Island&lt;/a&gt; (P.E.I.), &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; were overwhelmed by community support Tuesday when the restaurant overflowed with customers, cards, flowers, and personal pleas to not leave the province.

According to ♡❤CBC News Prince Edward Island♡❤, the recent outpouring of support occurred after Tommy and Lina Ko, the restaurant owners, announced they would close the restaurant and leave the province following an incident two weeks ago, when groups of up to 200 teens from two nearby schools surrounded the restaurant, pelting it with snowballs, and threatening the Kos. Charlottetown Police Chief Paul Smith told CBC PEI that his force is ready to take whatever action is necessary to crack down on the behaviour and last week started videotaping over lunchtime when most of the misbehaviour has taken place. Police noted that they have received complaints from other businesses, pedestrians, and drivers in the busy "fast food alley" and intend to seek co-operation from the schools in identifying the main culprits.

However, a CBC PEI story from October, 2002, reported the Kos asking police to do more to stop the littering and other vandalism in the area including having signs smashed, windows broken, and fireworks set off in front of their restaurant. At that time, Deputy Chief Richard Collins told CBC PEI: "You can't have upwards of 1,500 to 2,000 students in and around that area at dinner hour and not expect for some of them to misbehave," but promised to continue patrols and try to teach the students respect of property.

Tommy Ko told CBC News that he was overwhelmed by the support this week and in thanks put on a surprise free buffet, though customers insisted on paying anyway. Nevertheless, after fighting the harassment for some five years, the Kos say they still are not sure they want to stay.

In an interview broadcast on Russian state-run Channel One television, deposed &lt;a href="w%3AKyrgyzstan"&gt;Kyrgyz&lt;/a&gt; president &lt;a href="w%3AAskar%20Akayev"&gt;Askar Akayev&lt;/a&gt;, when asked whether he was prepared to resign as president, replied, "Of course, of course - if I am given the relevant guarantees and if it is in full accordance with the current legislation."

He added that he had "the desire to help so that the newly elected president is legitimate."

While acting president and prime minister &lt;a href="w%3AKurmanbek%20Bakiyev"&gt;Kurmanbek Bakiyev&lt;/a&gt; and former acting minister of securities Felix Kulov have offered him immunity, he said he would only return if parliament offered him "personal safety guarantees."

Bakiyev warned that Akayev's return could "give rise to mass unrest."

In related news, acting minister of securities Felix Kulov has been removed from parliament on his own will, RIA Novosti reported the parliamentary press service as saying.

He was reported as saying that "The set goal has been achieved: the situation in our republic has stabilized."

&lt;a href="w%3AMaher%20Arar"&gt;Maher Arar&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="Syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;n-born &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; citizen, is suing the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, accusing them of kidnapping him and sending him to Syria, where he was detained and tortured for a year. On Wednesday, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20New%20York%20Times"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reported that flight logs they have examined appear to support his claims.

They report that records in a database compiled from &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Federal%20Aviation%20Agency"&gt;U.S. Federal Aviation Agency&lt;/a&gt; records show that a Gulfstream III jet, tail number N829MG, followed a flight path matching the route he described on October 8. 2002, a day after his deportation order was signed. The flight went from New Jersey to an airport near Washington, then to Maine, Rome, and beyond.

The records also show that the jet made a trip to &lt;a href="w%3AGuant%C3%A1namo%20Bay"&gt;Guantánamo Bay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Cuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;, where the United States holds hundreds of detainees.

The &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Justice%20Department"&gt;U.S. Justice Department&lt;/a&gt;, in papers filed in a New York court replying to Arar's lawsuit, says the case was not one of &lt;a href="w%3Arendition"&gt;rendition&lt;/a&gt;, deportation for interrogation abroad, but simply one of deportation. They claim that he was deported to Syria because they had information that he was a member of &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Qaeda"&gt;Al Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;. Arar denies this allegation.

Arar was freed from Syrian detainment in October 2003. Syrian officials said they had not been able to find information connecting him to Al Qaeda. The Syrian ambassador to the United States referred to the release as "a gesture of good will toward Canada."

In a telephone interview with The New York Times, after seeing a photograph of the plane and being informed of the path it followed, Arar said "I think that's it. I think you've found the plane that took me."

"The facts we got from Maher right after he was released are now corroborated by public records," Maria LaHood, a lawyer for Arar said. "The more information that comes out, the better for showing that this is an important public issue that can't be kept secret."

A spokesman for the U.S. Justice Department, Charles Miller, said that the government has no comment on the case. The administration has refused to cooperate with the Canadian inquiry into the case and has asked a judge to dismiss his lawsuits on the grounds that classified information would be revealed if they were allowed to continue.

&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; has said it is not United States policy to engage in torture or send detainees to countries where they are likely to be tortured.

Pressure is building on &lt;a href="w%3AMyanmar"&gt;Myanmar&lt;/a&gt; to decline next years revolving &lt;a href="w%3AASEAN"&gt;ASEAN&lt;/a&gt; chair due to its human rights record. The &lt;a href="w%3AUS"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; Majority Whip &lt;a href="w%3AMitch%20McConnell"&gt;Mitch McConnell&lt;/a&gt;, has said that the USA should boycott ASEAN meetings next year if Myanmar takes the chair.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUN"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; special envoy to Myanmar, &lt;a href="w%3ATan%20Sri%20Razali%20Ismail"&gt;Tan Sri Razali Ismail&lt;/a&gt;, has backed moves by &lt;a href="w%3AMalaysia"&gt;Malaysian&lt;/a&gt; lawmakers earlier this week against Myanmar's chairing, saying "The UN is always on the side of democracy. It supports the principles these people are pushing and these principles are very important for all governments to adhere to,"

“I don’t think there’s any attempt to punish Myanmar but to make them understand ASEAN is guided by certain principles in order to be a member or in order to be leading ASEAN for a certain period,”

Filipino legislators are also following Malaysian lawmakers, and are expected to propose that all member countries adopt a stand on Myanmar when ASEAN legislators meet in an Inter-Parliamentary Union conference in &lt;a href="w%3AManila"&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt; on April 3.

Success may be too much of a good thing for the future of storied BBC series ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ADoctor%20Who"&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. After the unexpected popularity of last Saturday's return of the series to BBC airwaves, the star of the show is calling it quits from fears of typecasting.

According to a report from the BBC, actor &lt;a href="w%3AChristopher%20Eccleston"&gt;Christopher Eccleston&lt;/a&gt;, who injected a edgier and sexier image onto the title character plans to leave the series once his 13-episode commitment is over later this year. Eccleston told reporters that his last appearance as The Doctor will be for a December Christmas special.

The show, which debuted March 26 after a 16-year hiatus, was the highest-rated television show in the UK that night. With an estimated viewership of about 10.5 million at its peak, more than 44 percent of all television households in the country tuned in to see the new Doctor. "The audience's response for the new Doctor Who has been incredible and I am really proud to be part of it and I hope viewers continue to enjoy the series," Eccleston said in a BBC release. 

But that popularity was a double-edged sword for Eccleston. With roughly half the population seeing him as Doctor Who, he feared that once typecast as a science fiction &lt;a href="w%3ATime%20Lord"&gt;Time Lord&lt;/a&gt;, audiences may not accept him in other roles. At one year, Eccleston will be the shortest-lived Doctor after &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20McGann"&gt;Paul McGann&lt;/a&gt; who starred in the 1996 telemovie.

But the television network airing the show wants more of the crowd pleaser. The BBC has committed to producing a second 13-episode run of the reinvigorated series and says it is in talks with actor &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Tennant"&gt;David Tennant&lt;/a&gt; to take on the role. Tennant is a star of the BBC period drama, ♡❤Casanova♡❤.

In the announcement of the renewal of ♡❤Doctor Who♡❤, the BBC did say it re-signed series co-star &lt;a href="w%3ABillie%20Piper"&gt;Billie Piper&lt;/a&gt;, who agreed to reprise the role of the Doctor's sidekick for series two.

Councillors at &lt;a href="Dresden"&gt;Dresden&lt;/a&gt; City Council in &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; would like to match doggy-doo left by pets on the sidewalk and in parks, against a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADNA"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; database storing profiles for all of the city's 12,000 registered dogs. Karl Jobig, a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20Democratic%20Union%20of%20Germany"&gt;Christian Democrat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; politician in Dresden, was surprised when his proposal received a majority vote.

"In this way, Dresden will once again be one of the cleanest cities in Germany," Roland Putzger, the leader of the local council, told ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Guardian"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤.

DNA from registered dogs would be collected from blood or saliva for the "genetic fingerprinting" service.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASaxony"&gt;Saxony&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's data protection commissioner, Andreas Schurig, ruled that dogs had no rights over their data and could not object to the compulsory tests.

The proposal will be binding if the council passes it by majority vote in May.

A report Tuesday from a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;-backed project, consulting more than 1,300 scientists from 95 countries, and written over the last four years, warns that 60 percent of the basics of life on Earth &amp;mdash; water, food, timber, clean air &amp;mdash; are currently being used in ways which degrade them. Furthermore, fisheries and fresh water use-patterns are unsustainable, and getting worse.

"The harmful consequences of this degradation could grow significantly worse in the next 50 years," according to a press release from the &lt;a href="w%3AMillennium%20Ecosystem%20Assessment"&gt;Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA)&lt;/a&gt;, a massive four-year study begun in 2001.

"We've had many reports on environmental degradation, but for the first time we're now able to draw connections between ecosystem services and human well-being," Cristian Samper, director of the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History in Washington and a chief architect of the study, told the Christian Science Monitor.

The project's &lt;a href="http%3A//www.maweb.org/proxy/document.aspx%3Fsource%3Ddatabase%26amp%3BTableName%3DDocuments%26amp%3BIdField%3DDocumentID%26amp%3BId%3D356%26amp%3BContentField%3DDocument%26amp%3BContentTypeField%3DContentType%26amp%3BTitleField%3DTitle%26amp%3BFileName%3DMA%2BGeneral%2BSynthesis%2B-%2BFinal%2BDraft.pdf%26amp%3BLog%3DTrue"&gt;♡❤Synthesis Report♡❤&lt;/a&gt;, first in a series of eleven documents and published yesterday, explains the objective: ♡❤"to assess the consequences of ecosystem change for human well-being and to establish the scientific basis for actions needed to enhance the conservation and sustainable use of ecosystems and their contributions to human well-being."♡❤

It then goes on to report on four main findings:

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤Changes over the last 50 years to meet rapidly growing demands for food, fresh water, timber, fiber and fuel, have effected substantial and largely irreversible loss in the diversity of life on Earth.♡❤

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤Net gains in human well-being and economic development are offset by growing costs, in the form ecosystem degradation, the possibility of abrupt and unpredictable ecosystem changes, and worsened poverty for some groups. Unless addressed, these problems will substantially diminish the benefits that future generations obtain from ecosystems.♡❤

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤Ecosystem degradation could grow significantly worse over the next 50 years, presenting a barrier to meeting UN Millennium Development Goals.♡❤

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤The challenge of reversing the degradation while meeting increasing ecological demands can be partially met under some scenarios, but only with significant changes in policies, institutions and practices &amp;mdash; changes that are not currently under way.♡❤

</ul>
Walter Reid, the study's director, speaking at yesterday's &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; launch of the report said it shows that over the last 50 years "humans have changed ecosystems more rapidly and extensively than in any comparable time in human history."

"This has resulted in substantial and largely irreversible loss in the diversity of life on Earth," he said.

It is unclear what this will mean to future generations or the possible emergence of new diseases, absence of fresh water and the continuing decline of fisheries and completely unpredictable weather.

With half of the urban populations of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AAfrica"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AAsia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ALatin%20America"&gt;Latin America&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ACaribbean"&gt;Caribbean&lt;/a&gt; suffering from several diseases associated with these problems, the death toll is reaching 1.7 million people a year. Entire species of mammals, birds and amphibians are disappearing from the planet at nearly 1,000 times the natural rate, according to the study. Oxygen-depleted coastal waters and rivers result from overuse of nitrogen &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Afertilizer"&gt;fertilizer&lt;/a&gt; - an effect known as "nutrient loading" which leads to continuing &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Abiodiversity"&gt;biodiversity&lt;/a&gt; loss.

With the United States' non-participation in the &lt;a href="w%3AKyoto%20Treaty"&gt;Kyoto Treaty&lt;/a&gt;, former U.S. Senator Timothy Wirth, president of this U.N. Foundation, says "U.S. leadership is critical in providing much-needed expertise, technological capabilities and ingenuity to restore ecosystems.

"We can take steps at home to reduce our nation's adverse impact on the global environment."

"At the heart of this assessment is a stark warning," said the 45-member board.

A man accused of driving under the influence of alcohol stuffed his mouth full of feces in a failed attempt to foil the police &lt;a href="w%3Abreathalyzer"&gt;breathalyzer&lt;/a&gt;.

The man was arrested Sunday by &lt;a href="w%3ASimcoe%20County%2C%20Ontario"&gt;South Simcoe&lt;/a&gt; Police after his pickup truck was pulled over on Ontario Provincial Highway 11 in &lt;a href="w%3AStroud%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Stroud&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AOntario"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;. On the way to the police station for testing, the 59-year-old vomited, urinated, and defecated in the police cruiser. Sgt. James Buchanan said that upon arriving at the station, the prisoner grabbed a handful of his own waste "and placed it in his mouth, attempting to trick the breathalyzer machine".

Nevertheless, the man registered two readings of more than twice the legal &lt;a href="w%3ABlood%20alcohol%20content"&gt;blood alcohol&lt;/a&gt; limit of 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood in his system. He was charged with impaired driving and driving over the limit and was released on a promise to appear in a &lt;a href="w%3ABradford%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Bradford&lt;/a&gt;, Ontario court on May 12.

Harvard University recently hosted a symposium called &lt;a href="http%3A//www.mediacenter.org/content/5100.cfm%3FFLASH7%3D2"&gt;"Whose News? Media, Technology and the Common Good"&lt;/a&gt; at its Nieman Foundation for Journalism. Held March 3-4 and providing a certain amount of video to be rebroadcast through the web, the event was widely commented on by both bloggers and traditional media.

Among the participants was Richard Sambrook, Director of the BBC World Service and Global News Division, which has taken on the challenge of incorporating the voices of citizen journalists into their news gathering and presentation process. At what he calls the "community level", the BBC is engaging a project called "Digital Storytelling" in which they are assisting and working with individuals in the recording and production of videos that "document their lives and report and cull things of importance to them", which the BBC has then distributed by a variety of means. They are also encouraging participation in issues of citizen concern at the national and international levels.

Some participants such as co-creator of the seminar, Matt Thompson expressed concern over the growing centralization of the ownership of mainstream news media in the hands of a few corporate sponsors, at the same time it incorporates these growing sources of audience information. "I think that people are looking forward to a media that can truly respond to them, even if the...corporate centralization aspects of it in this giant 'Googlezon' entity give many people pause" quoting a &lt;a href="http%3A//www.metafilter.com"&gt;MetaFilter.com&lt;/a&gt; thread to the effect, "I for one welcome our new Googlezon overlords."

There was some discussion of the traditional media and its engagement with recent issues of national importance. "I think there's been a massive media failure across the board...there's been an institutional failure.", said MediaChannel Executive Editor Danny Schechter in discussing his film, "WMD: Weapons of Mass Distortion". He suggested two basic fixes including "more diversity of perspective...let's have a real debate and discussion" and "don't take everything at face value and check facts and look at perspectives from other countries." He decried what he called "groupthink" in American media and called for "more feisty independent journalists, and more watchdog, less lapdog."

However, some other critics have elsewhere expressed concerns about the actual independence and diversity of webloggers and other non-traditional media as an antidote to perceived media bias. For example, there is often a perceived lack of race or sex diversity among top bloggers. Steven Levy, a senior editor of Newsweek, has recently written a column addressing concerns about the over-representation of white males among top bloggers on the Internet. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.technorati.com"&gt;Technorati.com&lt;/a&gt;, a website which describes itself as "the authority on what is happening on the real-time web", maintains a list of the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.technorati.com/live/top100.html"&gt;top 100 blogs&lt;/a&gt; that was used as the basis for his column. However, others such as &lt;a href="http%3A//www.nationalreview.com/comment/mac_donald200503300758.asp"&gt;Heather Mac Donald&lt;/a&gt; at National Review have pointed out that there are no actual barriers to participation to anyone who wishes to engage in blogging, and so such imbalances in representation are probably not the result of personal bias.

Elections in &lt;a href="Zimbabwe"&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt; began with both the ruling and opposition parties predicting victory.

Current president &lt;a href="Robert%20Mugabe"&gt;Robert Mugabe&lt;/a&gt; predicts a "mountainous victory" for his party, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AZimbabwe%20African%20National%20Union%20-%20Patriotic%20Front"&gt;Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Zanu-PF). The main opposition &amp;mdash; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMovement%20for%20Democratic%20Change"&gt;Movement for Democratic Change&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (MDC) claims the election is being rigged, and despite being allowed to freely campaign, the government's intimidation of voters and moves to hurt opposition supporters will prevent the MDC win. 

The government recently withheld food aid from those supporting the MDC, according to a United Nations report. The UN further reports the government dismissed election officials and poll workers suspected of supporting MDC.

Criticism of the government has been loud. Last week, a Catholic archbishop in Zimbabwe urged followers to start a non-violent, popular uprising against Mugabe, and rallies have been common in recent days. The previous elections, which the MDC almost won, were marred by violence and similar allegations of vote-rigging.

More than 5.7 million Zimbabweans are registered to vote, and can cast their ballots at one of the more than 8,000 polling stations.

A tanker truck filled with 35 tons of liquid &lt;a href="w%3Achlorine"&gt;chlorine&lt;/a&gt; collided with another truck and crashed in &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJiangsu"&gt;Jiangsu province&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday, leaking its load, killing at least 28 and injuring hundreds. 10,000 villagers have been evacuated from the surrounding area along the &lt;a href="w%3ABeijing"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3AShanghai"&gt;Shanghai&lt;/a&gt; expressway.

The driver left the scene of the accident in &lt;a href="w%3AHuai%27an"&gt;Huai'an city&lt;/a&gt;, but later in the day turned himself over to authorities in &lt;a href="w%3ANanjing"&gt;Nanjing&lt;/a&gt;, the provincial capital. The driver of the other truck died on the scene.

Vice mayor Lu Changsu told China's ♡❤Xinhua♡❤ that the death toll may increase because three patients are still in critical condition. Lu said that 350 people remain hospitalized.

A cleanup crew is treating the accident site with a caustic soda. Area farmers are concerned that local farmland will be rendered infertile by the spill.

&lt;a href="w%3ACommunist%20Party%20of%20China"&gt;CPC&lt;/a&gt; Vice Premier &lt;a href="w%3AHuang%20Ju"&gt;Huang Ju&lt;/a&gt; asked the provincial Jiangsu government to "spare no efforts", according to ♡❤Xinhua♡❤.

&lt;a href="Terri%20Schiavo"&gt;Terri Schiavo&lt;/a&gt; died this morning in St. Petersburg, &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, moments after 9 a.m. EST. Thirteen days ago, her feeding tube was removed after courts repeatedly ruled Schiavo would not want to be kept alive in her current state. Schiavo suffered severe brain damage in 1990 after a mysterious cardiac arrest. 

Many news sources allege the cardiac arrest was caused by an eating disorder, while her family maintains she had no eating disorder at all. During the attack, her brain was starved of oxygen for 14 minutes, leading to the death of many of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="wikt%3Aneuron"&gt;neurons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in her brain and possibly leaving her in a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Apersistent%20vegetative%20state"&gt;persistent vegetative state&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (PVS).

Michael Schiavo argued before the courts that his wife would not want to live for a prolonged period on a feeding tube. In 2001, the tube was removed, but was reinserted two days later after an appeal by Terri's parents, Bob and Mary Schindler. After the Schindler family had all of their appeals rejected, the tube was removed once again in 2003, but reinserted six days later when Governor &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJeb%20Bush"&gt;Jeb Bush&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the Florida legislature collaborated on a bill, allowing Bush to order the tube reinserted. After the law was overturned in May of 2004, and the Schindler family's numerous appeals were again rejected, the tube was removed on March 18th.

President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; held a press conference, in part to offer his condolences to the friends and family of Schiavo. The president commended those on both sides of the issue.

An autopsy is planned to be performed in the coming days, which both the Schindler family and Michael Schiavo hope will shed some light on the cause of her brain damage.

Schiavo is survived by her husband, parents and her younger siblings Robert Jr. and Suzanne; she had no children. Schiavo was 41 years old.

Google engineer Reza Behforooz announced in a Google blog entry on March 30 that search engine Google has enabled "♡❤link prefetching♡❤" for some of their search results. The ♡❤link prefetching♡❤ has not been standardized, but it can enable faster page loading of Google search results in Mozilla and Firefox browsers that have the feature enabled.

When Google determines a user has a high likelihood of clicking on a search result, Google inserts a tag into the results they send out in response to a search. Some browsers can then preload that page, so in the event the user does select the page, it loads very quickly.

For example, a Google search for "wikipedia" today by yielded an HTML page with this code included:
codice_1
While not a formal benchmark, in casual testing by , Firefox 1.0.2 loaded the Wikipedia main page in about half the time when the page had been ♡❤link prefetched♡❤, as opposed to when it had not been. The load times were approximately 1.5 seconds and 3 seconds respectively. Internet Explorer 6.0 loaded the same page in slightly less than 3 seconds.

Users who want to disable prefetching in Firefox can do the following:

<ol>
BULLET::::1. Type "&lt;a href="w%3AAbout%3A%20URI%20scheme%23Mozilla-specific%20about%3A%20addresses"&gt;about:config&lt;/a&gt;" in the address bar.
BULLET::::2. Scroll down to the setting "network.prefetch-next".
BULLET::::3. Right-click on the value and click "Toggle".

Tawfik Tirawi, head of &lt;a href="w%3APalestine"&gt;Palestinian&lt;/a&gt; Intelligence in the &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Bank"&gt;West Bank&lt;/a&gt;, resigned Thursday. &lt;a href="w%3AFatah"&gt;Fatah&lt;/a&gt; officials said he told President &lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud%20Abbas"&gt;Mahmoud Abbas&lt;/a&gt; that too little was being done to curb lawlessness in the West Bank and &lt;a href="w%3AGaza"&gt;Gaza&lt;/a&gt;.

"I cannot work under these conditions," he wrote in a letter of resignation given to Abbas.

He reportedly claims other heads of Palestinian security organizations had not done enough to impose the rule of law Abbas has promised. Abbas himself said some senior Palestinian officials are blocking his reform efforts.

Tirawi is the most senior security official to resign since Abbas' election in January.

The &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union (EU)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; announced they will impose a 15% &lt;a href="w%3ATariff"&gt;tariff&lt;/a&gt; on some &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States (U.S.)&lt;/a&gt; imports. Permission for the &lt;a href="w%3ATrade%20sanctions"&gt;sanctions&lt;/a&gt; was granted by the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Trade%20Organization"&gt;World Trade Organization (WTO)&lt;/a&gt; due to the U.S. maintaining a law known as the &lt;a href="w%3AByrd%20Amendment"&gt;Byrd Amendment&lt;/a&gt;, which gives its companies billions of dollars collected from foreign rivals.

&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Congress"&gt;U.S. Congress&lt;/a&gt; failed to repeal the four-year-old Byrd Amendment ruled illegal by the WTO in September &lt;a href="w%3A2002"&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt;. The WTO gave the EU and Canada, in addition to &lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; the right to impose retaliatory tariffs on November 27. The tariffs will take effect May 1.

The retaliatory tariffs will largely affect U.S. &lt;a href="w%3APaper"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AClothing"&gt;clothing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMachine"&gt;machinery&lt;/a&gt; for the EU and live &lt;a href="w%3APig"&gt;swine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACigarette"&gt;cigarettes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AOyster"&gt;oysters&lt;/a&gt; for Canada.

In the &lt;a href="w%3A2004"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt; fiscal year, U.S. based Timken received $40 million, and Lancaster Colony Corp. received about $26 million. The EU says that total payouts will rise as high as $1.6 billion in the fiscal year of &lt;a href="w%3A2005"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt; unless the law is repealed. The U.S. Congressional Budget Office estimated that payouts for the fiscal year of &lt;a href="w%3A2006"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt; will reach $1.15 billion.

The European tariffs will collect near $26 million, while the Canadian tariffs will amount to near $11.6 million.

The European Commission, in a statement, said the tariffs were caused by "the continuing failure of the U.S. to bring its legislation into conformity with its international obligations."

According to Canadian Trade Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Peterson"&gt;Jim Peterson&lt;/a&gt;, the tariffs are "a strong message that we are all sending to the U.S. that international rule, those of the WTO, must be respected. We just cannot allow the U.S. to illegally disburse funds that are collected."

A spokesman for the U.S. Trade Representative, Richard Mills, said "We're disappointed that this step is being taken. The U.S. is working to comply with the WTO decision."

Other countries such as Japan and Mexico are considering a similar move.

&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; has called for congress to repeal the Byrd Amendment since February.

<h1>Pope in medical crisis</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Pope%20in%20medical%20crisis&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
Several sources report Pope &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Paul%20II"&gt;John Paul II&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who was receiving nutrition from a tube inserted through his nose, is no longer using the tube. The tube was inserted shortly after the pontiff appeared at his window overlooking &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Peter%E2%80%99s%20Square"&gt;St. Peter’s Square&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and was only able to speak several words.

The tube used was threaded down the nose and throat into the stomach. A surgically implanted tube was also considered at the time, but it was deemed excessively invasive according to Dr. Barbara Paris, director of geriatrics at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMaimonides%20Medical%20Center"&gt;Maimonides Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

There are reports the pontiff has a severe urinary tract infection. The infection caused a severe fever which developed into a medical crisis. He is being treated by antibiotics and has recently suffered from heart failure and a significant reduction in kidney function. According to the Vatican, he is currently "lucid", breathing shallowly, and surrounded by his top aides.

The Pope's condition has led many to pray &amp;mdash; both &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARoman%20Catholicism"&gt;Catholics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and non-Catholics. A large number of people are outside the papal apartment in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVatican%20City"&gt;Vatican City&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Many people have also come to pray at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Patrick%27s%20Cathedral%2C%20New%20York"&gt;St. Patrick's Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The ailing Pope also suffers from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AParkinson%27s%20disease"&gt;Parkinson's disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which makes it difficult for him to talk while knee and hip ailments are taking a serious toll on his mobility. The series of new ailments follows the breathing tube insertion by only a month's time.

<h1>US lowers bar in age discrimination suits</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=US%20lowers%20bar%20in%20age%20discrimination%20suits&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Supreme%20Court"&gt;US Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; ruled Wednesday that &lt;a href="w%3APlaintiff"&gt;plaintiffs&lt;/a&gt; bringing lawsuits against employers need not prove the employers intended to &lt;a href="w%3ADiscrimination"&gt;discriminate&lt;/a&gt; against them on the basis of their age. The ruling lowers the legal bar, over which an employee who felt wronged by an employer must pass, by allowing cases to move forward when explicit evidence is lacking.

The court ruled on the case of police officers in &lt;a href="w%3AJackson%2C%20Mississippi"&gt;Jackson,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMississippi"&gt;Miss.&lt;/a&gt; In their 5-3 decision, they found for a group of officers to proceed with damages claiming they were harmed by their department’s salary policy. The findings of the court do not mean the group of officers will necessarily win their lawsuit. Rather, the judges thought their particular case was flimsy, but they ruled the officer’s complaints were on valid grounds to pursue the claim. Therefore, the suit will not be thrown out of Mississippi’s state court as being groundless.

Business interests closely watching the case and fearing worse were reassured by the court stopping far short of supporting the officers’ claims. The Jackson city salary plan was changed to increase the pay of junior level officers by 30% to be competitive with surrounding &lt;a href="w%3AMunicipality"&gt;municipalities&lt;/a&gt; and attract recruits.

The more senior level police officers’ age discrimination allegations will probably not be enough to win the suit, but the effect of the new law means employers will need to defend their practices, and cannot summarily get lawsuits dismissed on the basis of allegations being groundless. Legal scholars believe this has importance because it acknowledges some forms of age discrimination in the work place are subtle. With half of US workers in the workforce now over 40, employers will need to be attentive to their practices or find them challenged in court.

The language of the ruling broadens the nation’s existing law found in the &lt;a href="w%3AAge%20Discrimination%20in%20Employment%20Act"&gt;Age Discrimination in Employment Act&lt;/a&gt; passed in 1967. While lawyers do not expect a great increase in age-bias cases due to the ruling, it does make the path to mounting a case easier. It is notable that corporate policies that do adversely discriminate against older workers are still considered legal if they are formed on reasonable grounds other than age. The law’s effect will not necessarily have employers change their policies, but rather re-think their practices to assure they are fair.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Iraq%3A%20Uneven%20voter%20turnout%20elects%20women%20who%20push%20sharia%20law%20while%20anti-woman%20violence%20rages&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Half of those who won seats reserved for women in the new &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Assembly"&gt;National Assembly of Iraq&lt;/a&gt; are members of a coalition dominated by &lt;a href="w%3AShi%27a%20Islam"&gt;Shi'a&lt;/a&gt; religious parties, and they say they want &lt;a href="w%3AIslam"&gt;Islamic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASharia"&gt;sharia&lt;/a&gt;-based laws with legal differences in treatment for the sexes, and which permit a certain level of domestic violence.

Says Nada al-Bayiati, of the Women’s Organisation for Freedom in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, "It's weakening our position. How can you argue for women’s rights when the women are undermining you?"

Eighty-nine in all, women make up one-third of the current parliament.

<h3>United Iraqi Alliance pushes for sharia</h3>

The Shi'a cleric-backed &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Iraqi%20Alliance"&gt;United Iraqi Alliance (UIA)&lt;/a&gt;, holds the majority of seats in the National Assembly since the &lt;a href="w%3AIraqi%20legislative%20election%2C%202005"&gt;recent election&lt;/a&gt;, and asserts that sharia is ♡❤"non-negotiable"♡❤.

"If you say to a man he cannot use force against a woman, you are asking the impossible," &lt;a href="w%3APediatrics"&gt;pediatrician&lt;/a&gt; turned politician, Jenan Al-Ubaedey of the UIA, told ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Times"&gt;The Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

"So we say a husband can beat his wife, but he cannot leave a mark. If he does that, he will be punished."

"If you don’t allow your husband to take another wife, he’d have an affair anyway . . . I’d rather know my husband has another wife that I know about."

Under a proposed law, men would be allowed up to four wives, regardless of the desires of the first wife, while women may have only one husband.

And if two other laws currently slated for debate go through, women will only be eligible for half the inheritance given to men, and denied custody of children over the age of 2 in the event of divorce.

<h3>Skewed vote, with little choice on women's rights</h3>

Legitimacy of the election, and the Assembly it elected, has been questioned.

Forty &lt;a href="w%3ASunni%20Islam"&gt;Sunni&lt;/a&gt; groups via the Muslim Scholars Association, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.truthout.org/docs_04/112004B.shtml"&gt;had called for boycotting&lt;/a&gt; to protest the U.S.-led occupation, while Shi'a on the other hand vigorously promoted voting in the election, influencing not only voter turnout, but also what candidates were on offer.

&lt;a href="http%3A//query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html%3Fres%3DF70816F83A5D0C748CDDA80894DD404482"&gt;And over 40% of Iraq's population&lt;/a&gt; live in mostly-Sunni &lt;a href="w%3AGovernorates%20of%20Iraq"&gt;governates&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad%20Governorate"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Anbar"&gt;Al Anbar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANinawa"&gt;Ninawa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASalah%20ad%20Din"&gt;Salah ad Din&lt;/a&gt;, where entrenched violence &lt;a href="http%3A//www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0%2C2763%2C1385775%2C00.html"&gt;was significant-enough to dissuade willing voters&lt;/a&gt;.

Turnout in these four governates ranged from a mere 2%, in Al Anbar, to a high of only 51%, in Baghdad. Comparatively, in the nine more peaceful, mainly-Shi'a regions in the South, turnouts averaged 71%; and for the three Kurdish regions in the North, the average was 85%. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.globalpolicy.org/security/issues/iraq/election/2005/0213win.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Final official figures of the Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq (IECI), reveal that overall, &lt;a href="w%3AIraqi%20legislative%20election%2C%202005"&gt;58% of registered voters actually voted&lt;/a&gt; in the 2005 election &amp;mdash; however many who were eligible did not register including &lt;a href="http%3A//www.commondreams.org/headlines05/0125-07.htm"&gt;three quarters&lt;/a&gt; of expatriots.

One woman who abstained, Houzan Mahmoud, a UK based spokesperson for &lt;a href="http%3A//www.equalityiniraq.com/english/2005/ERN18-19.pdf"&gt;The Organization of Women’s Freedom in Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, did so not because of a clerical command or to protest the occupation. In a &lt;a href="http%3A//comment.independent.co.uk/commentators/story.jsp%3Fstory%3D605289"&gt;published statement&lt;/a&gt; she says that violence that has erupted against women since the invasion, and that policies do not differ significantly between candidates, when it comes to women's rights.

"If Iraqi women take part in Sunday's poll, who are they to vote for? Women's rights are ignored by most of the groupings on offer," she writes.

"In reality, these elections are, for Iraq's women, little more than a cruel joke. Amid the suicide attacks, kidnappings and US-led military assaults of the 20-odd months since Saddam's fall, the little-reported phenomenon is the sharp increase in the persecution of Iraqi women. Women are the new victims of Islamic groups intent on restoring a medieval barbarity and of a political establishment that cares little for women's empowerment.

"Having for years enjoyed greater rights than other women in the Middle East, women in Iraq are now losing even their basic freedoms. The right to choose their clothes, the right to love or marry whom they want. Of course women suffered under Saddam. I fled his cruel regime. I personally witnessed much brutality, but the subjugation of women was never a goal of the Baath party."

However, according to the US State Department's Fact Sheet &lt;a href="http%3A//www.state.gov/g/wi/rls/18877.htm"&gt;Iraqi Women Under Saddam's Regime: A Population Silenced&lt;/a&gt;, Iraqi women in fact endured significant political repression under the regime of Saddam Hussein. The Iraqi government and its representitives are claimed to have used beheading, rape, torture, and murder as political tools against certain women such as political dissidents or those whom the government declared to be prostitutes, in order to maintain their party's hold on power. 

Some of these kinds of violence continue to be perpetrated by certain individuals and groups in the new Iraq. Mahmoud continued, "In the last six months at least eight women have been killed in Mosul alone - all apparently by Islamic groups clamping down on female independence. Among these, a professor from the city's law school was shot and beheaded, a vet was killed on her way to work, and a pharmacist from the Alkhansah hospital was shot dead on her doorstep."

<h3>Move to sharia started before election</h3>

But the move to sharia law actually came before the election. In January 2004, the Iraqi Women's League (IWL) &lt;a href="http%3A//www.occupationwatch.org/article.php%3Fid%3D2651"&gt;expressed horror&lt;/a&gt; at the interim Shi'a dominated Iraqi Governing Council's ♡❤Decision 137♡❤, which they explain replaced Iraqi civil law concerning family law, with sharia law.

"Decision 137 establishes sectarianism and gives formal power to informal, unaccountable and self appointed religious 'leaders'," the IWL statement said.

"The Iraqi family law (otherwise known as the Personal Status Law) is the achievement of the struggle of the Iraqi people for much of the past century not a law written by Saddam Hussein."

After protest by IWL and others, and appeal to former U.S. administrator Paul Bremer, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.countercurrents.org/iraq-dasgupta151004.htm"&gt;the Decision was anulled&lt;/a&gt;.

<h3>Changes erode hard-won equality for women</h3>

♡❤&lt;a href="http%3A//www.countercurrents.org/iraq-dasgupta151004.htm%7CLiberating"&gt;Iraq! What About Iraqi Women?&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, an essay by Bhaskar Dasgupta, tells that Iraqi women were winning rights as early as the 1920s and 30s, which improved their status. By the time of the overthrow of Hussein, they had formal equality under law, including not only the right to vote and freedom from wearing of veils, but the right to work with equal pay, paid maternity leave, higher education, extensive medical coverage, and eligibility for political office or voluntary military service, among other rights.

According to Dasgupta, these rights made Iraq a leader in equality of the sexes in the Middle East for the better part of last century, although a number of studies reveal &lt;a href="http%3A//www.state.gov/g/wi/rls/18877.htm"&gt;horrific abuses&lt;/a&gt; of both women and men, under Hussein's regime, and Hussein enabled laws allowing men to kill their wives in certain situations (see Wikipedia article ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AHonor%20killing"&gt;Honor killing&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ for background on the practice).

The first Gulf War in 1991, and ensuing sanctions, made economic conditions in Iraq difficult, and literacy and employment rates of women began falling.

Now the majority party in the only internationally recognised parliament of Iraq wants to reaffirm the interim Iraqi Governing Council's repeal of the Personal Status Law, and its replacement with laws based on sharia, a doctrine which in some countries sees women stoned to death as punishment for engaging in extra-marital love affairs.

<h3>Random and pernicious violence against women sanctioned by some Islamists</h3>

The Organization of Women’s Freedom in Iraq in its &lt;a href="http%3A//www.equalityiniraq.com/english/2005/ERN18-19.pdf"&gt;latest newsletter, Equal Rights Now&lt;/a&gt;, alleges widespread violence against women since the U.S.-led invasion. The violence has been facilitated by the general lack of order, and includes documented cases coming from U.S. troops, as well as locals.

"Violence against Iraqi women in general and in the city of Mosul in particular continues. Groups of political Islamists, in collaboration with remnants of the &lt;a href="w%3ABa%27ath%20Party"&gt;Ba'ath Party&lt;/a&gt;, have launched a campaign of terror and killing against women for no reason other than that we are women," reads one report.

The report continues to detail killings of women attributed to Islamist gangs, who "have sanctioned the raping of
'' and '&lt;a href="w%3AInfidels"&gt;infidels&lt;/a&gt;' because they claim those women's souls, property and bodies are fair game for all so-called freedom fighters".

Many other such reports exist, despite a strong &lt;a href="w%3ATaboo"&gt;taboo&lt;/a&gt; against discussion of &lt;a href="w%3ASexual%20abuse"&gt;sexual abuse&lt;/a&gt;, which could be expected to result in significant under-reporting of these cases. However, many of the allegations have not had the degree of media coverage that the notorious &lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Ghraib%20torture%20and%20prisoner%20abuse%20%28no%20pictures%29"&gt;abuse cases of Abu Ghraib Prison&lt;/a&gt; of 2003-04 received.

<h3>Puppet politicians</h3>

According to Dr Udaedey, many of the women legislators are in fact puppets. "It's true that many of them — maybe a third — have just been put there by the men. They are not aware and don't come to meetings, so they don't know what's going on," she told The Times. "About 10 per cent of them are learning, but the others don’t really care."

However, Dr. Udaedey plans to remained focused on protecting the role of Iraqi women as shar'ia law seems destined to become a guiding influence on Iraq's new constitution. According to her &lt;a href="http%3A//csmonitor.com/2005/0225/p07s02-woiq.html"&gt;interview in the Christian Science Monitor&lt;/a&gt;, "She plans to encourage women to wear the hijab and focus on nurturing their families. At the same time, she says, she will fight for salary equity, paid maternity leave, and reduced work hours for pregnant women."

Elected Prime Minister Ibrahim Jaafari, in an &lt;a href="http%3A//service.spiegel.de/cache/international/spiegel/0%2C1518%2C347678-2%2C00.html"&gt;interview with Der Spiegel&lt;/a&gt;, also asserts that women will not be forgotten in the new Iraq. He says that sharia law will remain "only as one of several sources of jurisprudence" and that women will "Never [be required to wear veils in the new Iraq]. They will be free to choose for themselves."

<h1>Minutemen gather to patrol US-Mexican border in April</h1>
♡❤♡April 1, 2005♡❤♡ 

Starting April 1, an organization of volunteers known as the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.minutemanproject.com/"&gt;Minuteman Project&lt;/a&gt; is planning to begin patrolling a 23-mile stretch of the Arizona-Mexico border in the search for illegal immigrants. The project is described as the "nation's largest &lt;a href="w%3Aneighborhood%20watch"&gt;neighborhood watch&lt;/a&gt; group" by &lt;a href="w%3AMinutemen%20%28militia%29"&gt;Minuteman&lt;/a&gt; field operations director Chris Simcox. 

The goal of the project is to make Americans aware of porous and undefended American borders. Motivated by a concern for illegal drug trafficking, the availability of entry points for potential terrorists, and a lack of effective enforcement of immigration laws by US federal and state officials, the name Minuteman was used in order for the group to portray itself as a "grassroots effort to bring Americans to the defense of their homeland, similar to the way the original Minutemen from &lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; (and other &lt;a href="w%3A13%20original%20colonies"&gt;U.S. colonies&lt;/a&gt;) did in the late 1700s," according to the group's website.

The activities of the Minutemen are protected by legal rights found in the US Constitution, according to various commentators. Says &lt;a href="w%3AJanet%20Napolitano"&gt;Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano&lt;/a&gt;, "People are entitled to exercise their &lt;a href="w%3AFirst%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution"&gt;First Amendment&lt;/a&gt; rights and entitled to assemble...That's why you can't stop the Minutemen from coming even though, from a law enforcement perspective, it's worrisome to have untrained people, potentially armed, performing what should be a law enforcement function." Some of the Minutemen plan to be armed in order to defend themselves in case of aggressive action by potential armed illegal immigrants and those who transport them. The carrying of handguns is allowed under Arizona law and is protected by the &lt;a href="w%3ASecond%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution"&gt;Second Amendment&lt;/a&gt;.

The Minutemen are not allowed by law to arrest or detain potential illegal immigrants, and any such action is forbidden by the group's organizers. The project's goal is to survey the area using planes and binoculars, and to alert the appropriate authorities and follow suspected illegal immigrants until they are detained. Observers from various groups, most prominently the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union"&gt;American Civil Liberties Union&lt;/a&gt; (ACLU), plan to be on hand to monitor the activities of the Minutemen with a view to mounting possible legal challenges against them. 

Critics, such as some Arizona state Hispanic lawmakers, are planning to show up at the public gatherings and press conferences of the Minutemen, in order to raise criticism and present contrary points of view in the public eye about what they believe to be the current state of illegal immigration. Some opponents have also complained that many participants may be motivated by racism or vigilantism; however, the organizers of the Project make a point of emphasizing their lack of participation with separatist or supremacist groups and the racial diversity and inclusiveness of their volunteers.

Illegal immigrants and their public benefits have come under increasing scrutiny in recent months in Arizona, with the passing of Proposition 200 on November 2, 2004 by a margin of 56% of voters in favor. This proposition attempts to prevent illegal immigrants from voting or receiving some government services. The effort to define what benefits they can legally be excluded from is ongoing, for example with the recent failure of HB2264 to pass an Arizona senate committee; the bill would have required some illegal immigrants to pay higher out-of-state rates for college tuition.

Similar efforts to the current Minuteman Project have been organized in the past few years, but with few participants and without notable success. Some local residents were concerned that possible violence could erupt from the presence of additional armed individuals, either among the Minutemen or the illegal immigrants. Others welcomed the presence of the Minutemen, considering them tourists helping the local economy, and appreciating their drawing attention to the perceived lax enforcement of border control by Federal authorities. Their activities are planned to last for about a month.

<h1>Maine passes gay rights law</h1>

With the stroke of a pen, Gov. &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Baldacci"&gt;John Baldacci&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AMaine"&gt;Maine&lt;/a&gt; signed into law a &lt;a href="w%3AGay%20rights"&gt;gay rights&lt;/a&gt; bill that extended legal protection against discrimination on the basis of &lt;a href="w%3ASexual%20orientation"&gt;sexual orientation&lt;/a&gt;. The new law does not legalize &lt;a href="w%3ASame-sex%20marriage"&gt;same-sex marriage&lt;/a&gt;.

Known officially as "LD 1196," the bill's wording adds the term ♡❤sexual orientation♡❤ to the list of protected classes in the Maine Human Rights Act banning &lt;a href="w%3ADiscrimination"&gt;discrimination&lt;/a&gt; in employment, housing, education, credit, and public accommodations. The bill was passed by the &lt;a href="w%3AMaine%20State%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;Maine House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; by a vote of 91-58 Wednesday. The &lt;a href="w%3AMaine%20State%20Senate"&gt;State Senate&lt;/a&gt; approved the bill the same day by a vote of 25-10.

Already protected classes under the state's human rights act are &lt;a href="w%3AGender"&gt;gender&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAging"&gt;age&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AReligion"&gt;religion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARace"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3APhysical%20disability"&gt;physical&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMental%20illness"&gt;mental disability&lt;/a&gt;. Additional language was added to LD 1196 before it passed clarifying that it would not extend marriage rights to same-sex couples and exempts privately-funded religious groups from having to comply with its provisions. The new law takes effect June 30.

Government official said the new law is needed to send a message. The office of the &lt;a href="w%3AState%20of%20Maine%20Attorney%20General"&gt;Maine Attorney General&lt;/a&gt; says that the number of &lt;a href="w%3AHate%20crime"&gt;hate crimes&lt;/a&gt; against gays and lesbians increased by 12 percent in &lt;a href="w%3A2003"&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt;. Baldacci said those figures underscore why the new law is needed.

"This act not only offers essential civil rights, but serves as a welcome," Baldacci said in a press conference after signing the new law. "Our doors are open to all people. This is a proud day for Maine."

But at least one group is organizing to stop the new gay rights law in its tracks. According to reports, the &lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20Civic%20League%20of%20Maine"&gt;Christian Civic League of Maine&lt;/a&gt; has filed initial paperwork to put a &lt;a href="w%3AVoter%20initiative"&gt;voter initiative&lt;/a&gt; on the November 2005 general election ballot to overturn the new law.

The group must get at least 50,519 valid signatures from registered voters of the state by a June 28 deadline. Michael Heath, executive director of the group, told the &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; that the League has a goal of 70 thousand valid signatures and hopes to raise $2 million to fund a campaign, called a "people's Veto," to &lt;a href="w%3ARepeal"&gt;repeal&lt;/a&gt; the new law.

According to the Vatican, the medical condition of &lt;a href="w%3APope%20John%20Paul%20II"&gt;Pope John Paul II&lt;/a&gt; is very grave, and reports indicate that during today's treatment his heart momentarily stopped beating.

The pope has been undergoing treatment for a urinary infection, and yesterday developed a high fever. He has been breathing through a tube in his throat, and a feeding tube was inserted as the pope was having trouble swallowing. 

Earlier, news organizations reported that the pope received the sacrament for the sick and dying &amp;mdash; commonly known as last rites. The Vatican today confirmed this. These rites are administered to those close to death, but may also be administered to those very sick, and may be repeated if necessary. The pope has previously received last rites after an assassination attempt on his life in 1981.

The latest malady to affect the pope &amp;mdash; the urinary infection &amp;mdash; is treatable with &lt;a href="w%3Aantibiotic"&gt;antibiotic&lt;/a&gt;s, and according to a Vatican spokesperson the pope was responding well to such treatment. Some physicians fear that a failure in one system may "cascade" to a failure in other organs, further deteriorating the 84-year-old pope's health.

Some &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; newspapers have already claimed the Pope is dead, which the Vatican has denied.

Today &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, the free encyclopedia that anyone with access to the Internet can edit, was the victim of an onslaught of practical jokes, as &lt;a href="w%3AApril%20Fool%27s%20Day"&gt;April Fool's Day&lt;/a&gt; kicked in various timezones around the world, at least those parts which follow the &lt;a href="w%3AGregorian%20calendar"&gt;Gregorian calendar&lt;/a&gt;. It is believed that Wikipedia contributors were kept busy tidying up and removing prank articles and changes made by other Wikipedia contributors, and were expecting to be cleaning up the aftermath for days afterwards.

<h2>Pranks</h2>
The most highly visible prank was the &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia%3A2005%20Britannica%20takeover%20of%20Wikimedia"&gt;2005 Britannica takeover of Wikimedia&lt;/a&gt; encyclopaedia article. Other pranks included:
<ul>
BULLET::::- the changing of the deletion notice, affixed to encyclopaedia articles whose deletion is being discussed, to a "&lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php%3Ftitle%3DTemplate%3AVfd%26amp%3Boldid%3D11749823"&gt;termination notice&lt;/a&gt;", complete with a picture of &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Terminator"&gt;The Terminator&lt;/a&gt;;
BULLET::::- the nomination of the deletion discussion maintenance area of the encyclopaedia for front-page article status;
<ul>
BULLET::::- "In my days at Wikipedia, I've seen &lt;a href="w%3Afancruft"&gt;fancruft&lt;/a&gt;, middle schools, band vanity, hoaxes, [biased] forks, &lt;a href="w%3Aspam"&gt;spam&lt;/a&gt;, patent nonsense, &lt;nowiki&gt;[copyright violations]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and &lt;nowiki&gt;[system operator]&lt;/nowiki&gt; accountability policies. Now we have ONE article with ♡❤all of those♡❤!" said Wikipedia contributor &lt;a href="w%3AUser%3ASzyslak"&gt;Szyslak&lt;/a&gt;, in "opposition" to the motion. (Articles with such content are generally deemed unacceptable for Wikipedia and deleted. Their deletions are of course discussed in the deletion discussion area.)
</ul>
BULLET::::- the corresponding nomination of the discussion area for whether an article should have front-page status for deletion;
<ul>
BULLET::::- "Hopelessly biased in favour of good articles. Mistreatment of stubs and short articles are known to have occurred." said Wikipedia contributor &lt;a href="w%3AUser%3AAndylkl"&gt;Andylkl&lt;/a&gt;.
</ul>
BULLET::::- the nomination of the article on April Fool's Day itself for deletion by &lt;a href="w%3AUser%3AAlkivar"&gt;Alkivar&lt;/a&gt;;
<ul>
BULLET::::- "Not only is this utter nonsense, but terribly &lt;nowiki&gt;[biased]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. This falls ♡❤way♡❤ below encyclopedic standards. At this rate we'll have to be making articles for every arbitrary day of the year." said Wikipedia contributor &lt;a href="w%3AUser%3AArkyan"&gt;Arkyan&lt;/a&gt;. (Wikipedia does, in fact, have articles for every day of the year, listing important anniversaries of historical events and people.)
</ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia%3ABad%20jokes%20and%20other%20deleted%20nonsense/April%20Fools%27%20Day%202005/Requests%20for%20de-Godkingship"&gt;Requests for de-Godkingship&lt;/a&gt;
BULLET::::- modification of the article navigation tabs that appear on Wikipedia web pages, amongst others replacing "history" with "time travel";
BULLET::::- the translation of the user page of &lt;a href="w%3AJimmy%20Wales"&gt;Jimmy "Jimbo" Wales&lt;/a&gt;, founder of Wikipedia, into &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php%3Ftitle%3DUser%3AJimbo_Wales%26amp%3Boldid%3D11761336"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt;;
BULLET::::- Creation of the &lt;a href="w%3AUser%3ATriddle/M1126A%20Fryker"&gt;M1126A Fryker&lt;/a&gt; Armored Combat Deep Fryer ("The M1126A Fryker Armored Combat Deep Fryer is a modified M1126 Stryker capable of preparing the main course of a meal, under combat conditions, for 150 soldiers.") article.
BULLET::::- Addition to the Wikipedia:Votes for Deletion page of an image of a toaster (kitchen appliance) with the following caption: Wikipedia:Votes for deletion was first hosted on this BSD powered toaster. When that broke down, they had to use solar panels. Hence the reason the page loads so slowly.

</ul>
<h2>Ongoing cleanup</h2>
Most edits which were judged (rightly or wrongly) as April Fool's Day pranks were quickly undone, although tacit community consensus left several to stand throughout the whole period of April Fool's Day. Being accessible worldwide (by people who can afford Internet access) in all timezones, April Fool's Day lasts for more than 24 hours at Wikipedia. The change to the deletion notice was undone within 31 minutes, for example, despite the notice being altered at 05:08 UTC, night-time in Europe and the United States.

Several Wikipedia contributors have expressed their dismay at the amount of work being generated, though these views may or may not be indicitive of the contributor base at large:
<ul>
BULLET::::- "How do we tell people not to vandalize the encyclopedia when everybody's doing it?" said Wikipedia contributor &lt;a href="w%3AUser%3ARickK"&gt;RickK&lt;/a&gt;.
BULLET::::- "This is getting out of hand. Sneak vandalism everywhere, and it seems like every wikiuser feel they should have their own April Fools prank somewhere. I'm thinking maybe the best joke would be to let wikipedia not be editable today. Use the day to reindex tablebases or whatever it is that a day off can be used constructively to. Wikipedia should be correct all the year. God knows how long all this misinformation will live on on forgotten pages and various &lt;nowiki&gt;[caches]&lt;/nowiki&gt; around the net." said Wikipedia contributor &lt;a href="w%3AUser%3AShanes"&gt;Shanes&lt;/a&gt;.

</ul>
Other Wikipedians have shown dismay at how quickly the April Fools gags are undone:
<ul>
BULLET::::- "I spent two hours creating the &lt;a href="w%3AUser%3ATriddle/M1126A%20Fryker"&gt;M1126A Fryker&lt;/a&gt; article but it was deleted from ♡❤♡M1126A Fryker♡❤♡ in about 20 minutes. It seems it was even deleted with out going through Candidates for speedy deletion and I do not believe it qualified for deletion on the spot (nor do I believe it would of qualified for speedy deletion). Its important to have a sense of humor and rather than trying to squash the April Fools jokes perhaps we should find a way to work together. How about a template that is available to mark an article as an April fools joke or another template that helps track changes to articles done in the name of April Fools." said Wikipedia contributor &lt;a href="w%3AUser%3ATriddle"&gt;Triddle&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>Zimbabwe election victory for Mugabe</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Zimbabwe%20election%20victory%20for%20Mugabe&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
Amid claims of rigging by the opposition party, news reports today from the &lt;a href="w%3AZimbabwe"&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt; capital city of &lt;a href="w%3AHarare"&gt;Harare&lt;/a&gt;, say current &lt;a href="Robert%20Mugabe"&gt;President Robert Mugabe&lt;/a&gt; has again clinched a party victory in this round of national elections.

This national election bears similarity to the 2000 election when allegations that Mugabe's dominant political party, the &lt;a href="w%3AZimbabwe%20African%20National%20Union%20-%20Patriotic%20Front"&gt;Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front&lt;/a&gt; (Zanu-PF), used its position in power to steal the election were widespread. Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the &lt;a href="w%3AMovement%20for%20Democratic%20Change"&gt;Movement for Democratic Change&lt;/a&gt; (MDC), who after that election appealed to the nation's courts for justice, appears ready this time to take the argument to the street, possibly sparking violent protests and unrest. The leader urged, "Zimbabweans must defend their right to vote and they must defend their vote."

Past MDC street protests were met violently by Mugabe's regime, and the court system in Zimbabwe is seen as largely supportive of the Zanu-PF agenda.

The Zanu-PF took 55 of the 120 seats in the Zimbabwe Parliament. The MDC took 34 seats. The MDC had received strong support during pre-election rallies and had hoped to gain enough new seats to gain a legislative majority in the parliament. Mugabe, now 81, will appoint another 30 seats, which will ensure his party a majority.

Tsvangirai cites the area of Manyame located near the capital as an example of election rigging. Mugabe's nephew, Patrick Zhawao, the ruling party candidate was declared winner. On Thursday night election officials reported 14,812 votes were counted. Then early Friday morning, the total vote count was reported at 24,000, with Zhawao getting more than 15,000 of the vote.

The over-night voting count inconsistency led him to charge, "The government has fraudulently, once again, betrayed the people," he told reporters at a news briefing.

Stagecoach, Auckland's main busline, may suffer strikes from its workers on Monday. British-owned Stagecoach believes a one day strike has become unavoidable after unions representing over one thousand workers walked out of renewed negotiations yesterday.

Eighty thousand passengers making one hundred and fifty thousand trips in and area from Orewa to Pukekohe will be affected by the proposed industrial action. More strikes are also threatened for the following week.

Company operations director, Warren Fowler said, "They are looking hellbound to have a strike. We have now made four offers or proposals to the combined unions to reach a settlement and avert industrial action, but we just don’t seem to be making any headway - it’s very frustrating."

Unions advocate Gary Froggatt said he is frustrated the different offers represented different ways of dressing up the same amount of money. "They are using the same money - there is no increase in the money they are offering," he said.

♡❤♡April 1, 2005♡❤♡

A local news station reported the parents of the late Terri Schiavo, the Schindlers, are to sell a list containing the names of people who donated money to their fund. The fund was used to finance legal battles for keeping their daughter alive.

A spokesperson for the Schindlers confirmed the story.

The company who will receive the list, 'Response Unlimited', usually pays $150 a month for a list of 6,000 names, and $500 a month for a list of 6,000 e-mail addresses.

The Schindlers have declined to reveal how much money they will receive for their list.

♡❤♡Mid-Atlantic Coastal Region,USA♡❤♡

While residents of the northeast U,S, may doubt that &lt;a href="w%3ASpring%20%28season%29"&gt;Spring&lt;/a&gt; is really here judging from the recent cool, damp and rainy weather &lt;a href="w%3AMarch"&gt;March&lt;/a&gt; has afforded the region, local flora are now springing forth from the winter chill. Throughout the region, outdoor life has begun to burst forth with buds on trees and shrubs alike.

Area &lt;a href="w%3AForsythia"&gt;forsythia&lt;/a&gt; are in full bloom. This common and sturdy shrub can be found all around the region and is used as a source for seasonal flower cuttings suitable for various floral arrangements. The dormant stems of forsythia may be cut and brought inside before they bloom, where they will later flower when placed in a vase filled with water. Once spent, the yellow pedals fall off fairly quickly, usually within a few days.

After months of wintry nakedness, &lt;a href="w%3ABradford%20pear"&gt;Bradford pears&lt;/a&gt; also are entering their blooming season. In summer months while in full foliage, the trees are used as shade trees along city streets. But during spring bloom the resulting mess of dropping flower petals coupled with a spring rain can cover cars parked under such a tree with a sticky mess.

Regional rain fall accumulations for 2005 for January and February were 2 inches less than normal. That deficit was made up during March as the region was repeatedly soaked by rain. As a result, the total accumulation of rainfall for the year now is an inch above normal.

Emwatsi Primary School in western &lt;a href="w%3AKenya"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt; has been selected as a &lt;a href="2005"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt; international finalist for the Volvo Adventure Award for their project "Biodiversity Conservation through Beekeeping", which focuses on income diversification through honey production, conservation of natural vegetation and planting of bee forage trees.

It is the first time in the history of the Volvo Adventure Award that a Kenyan project has been selected as an international finalist. Emwatsi Primary School is a member of the Lake Victoria Schools Agroforestry &amp; Environmental Education Network, which is facilitated by the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.worldagroforestry.org"&gt;World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF)&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.kefri.org"&gt;Kenya Forestry Research Institute (KEFRI)&lt;/a&gt; within the framework of the 'Farmers of the Future' initiative.

Volvo Adventure was set up to recognize and reward practical environmental action being taken by young people in their local community. It is open to young people around the world aged between 10 and 16 years, working with schools and youth and community groups. Volvo Adventure is supported by the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.unep.org"&gt;United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)&lt;/a&gt;.

15 projects from all over the world have been selected by a jury of international experts out of hundreds of applications. Five pupils and two teachers of Emwatsi Primary School will take off to &lt;a href="w%3ASweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; in May to participate in the Volvo Adventure Conference and present their innovative project and practical action. The project will also be showcased to the world on the Volvo Adventure website and will contribute to an international handbook of practical environmental action.

<h1>MS-13 gang threatens the Arizona &quot;minutemen&quot;</h1>
♡❤♡April 1, 2005♡❤♡ 

Ebner Anivel Rivera-Paz, a leader of the vicious &lt;a href="w%3AMS-13"&gt;Mara Salvatruchas,&lt;/a&gt; nicknamed the MS-13 gang, issued orders from his prison cell for his followers to teach the American "Minutemen" volunteers a lesson when they begin patrolling the Mexican border today.

MS-13 gang members, considered by some to be America's most violent gang, is accused of engaging in such acts as cutting off the testicles of their enemies and feeding them to their dogs, and cutting the heads off their opponents to play soccer with. However, such allegations of brutality don't seem to frighten the "Minutemen", a group of more than 1,000 volunteers planning to patrol the Arizona-Mexico border beginning April 1st. They have been called vigilantes by &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AVicente%20Fox"&gt;Mexican President Vicente Fox.&lt;/a&gt; They sometimes sarcastically refer to themselves as "undocumented border patrol agents". James Gilchrist, a Vietnam veteran and spokesman for the Minutemen, in response to the MS-13 threat said; "We're not worried because half of our recruits are retired trained combat soldiers... they [MS-13] are just a bunch of punks."

The MS-13 gang now has about 20,000 members nationwide. The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, nicknamed ICE, began to focus on the gang with an initiative called "Operation Community Shield". The very existence of MS-13 is considered by the "Conservative Voice" to be a direct consequence of the USA government's 1980's policies in Central America; "the chickens are coming home to roost. Its MS-13 members are the sons of immigrants from El Salvador and other Central American countries that were forced to flee because of the CIA instigated war during the Reagan Administration that completely destroyed the physical, economic, social, religious and cultural infrastructure of the region. MS-13 was founded in Los Angeles by the offspring of the immigrants for protection.

Witnesses say a truck was idling near the scene of an explosion at a &lt;a href="w%3ATexas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; refinery which killed 15 and injured over 100 others on March 23, according to U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Manager Bill Hoyle.

"Witnesses saw vapor in the area of the truck and observed the engine begin to rev up and race," Hoyle's statement said. "This behavior by a diesel engine indicates the presence of a flammable atmosphere entering the air intake. A driver reported trying to shut off the engine but was unable to do so." Hoyle's statement continued, "There are multiple possible sources of ignition in an operating refinery unit and we have made no determination about the ignition source at this time."

The investigation has been delayed by &lt;a href="w%3ABP"&gt;BP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AOSHA"&gt;Occupational Safety &amp; Health Administration&lt;/a&gt; officials, who are trying to preserve evidence at the site for their investigation. They are also concerned about further injuries from hazards left over from the explosion, such as falling debris and unstable structures. The &lt;a href="w%3AEPA"&gt;Environment Protection Agency&lt;/a&gt; also detected &lt;a href="w%3Abenzene"&gt;benzene&lt;/a&gt; in the atmosphere over the plant, which was treated with a layer of foam.

BP has retained control of the plant since the March 23 accident. Police arrived quickly the day of the explosion, but left after the initial emergency was over.

"Our officers could respond over there, but they don't have a clue," Texas City police Sgt. Curtis Pope told the ♡❤Houston Chronicle♡❤. "The fact is they have chemical and equipment hazards. We don't know the chemicals."

&lt;a href="w%3ATed%20Koppel"&gt;Ted Koppel&lt;/a&gt; announced he plans to quit as host of the &lt;a href="w%3ANightline"&gt;'Nightline'&lt;/a&gt; television program after his contract runs out December 4, 2005. 

Executives at ABC are considering canceling the Nightline program after his departure or possibly changing the show to a live, hour-long format.

Nightline has fallen behind in rankings compared with programs such as "Meet the Press" and "Face the Nation". Network news in general is losing ground in recent years to cable news, talk shows and the Internet. Television anchormen who have left in the past several months include &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Brokaw"&gt;Tom Brokaw&lt;/a&gt; of NBC and &lt;a href="w%3ADan%20Rather"&gt;Dan Rather&lt;/a&gt; of CBS. The only other major television anchorman of the past few decades who remains in his chair is &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Jennings"&gt;Peter Jennings&lt;/a&gt;, who has been on ABC's "World News Tonight" since 1982.

Koppel began working for ABC in 1963, serving as a foreign correspondent for the network. He started working for the Nightline program in March 1980. The program, started in 1979, was created to provide nightly news updates on the &lt;a href="w%3AIran%20hostage%20crisis"&gt;Iran hostage crisis&lt;/a&gt;. 

Koppel is 65 years old and has a daughter named &lt;a href="w%3AAndrea%20Koppel"&gt;Andrea Koppel&lt;/a&gt;, who is the CNN correspondent to the Department of State. He says he has no plans to retire, but he is looking into other projects. Koppel received numerous awards for journalism, including 41 &lt;a href="w%3AEmmy"&gt;Emmy awards&lt;/a&gt;.

Another bomb has exploded late Friday in a shopping center in the Lebanese Christian village of Broummana east of Beirut. Nobody was killed in the blast, but twelve people have been wounded, though not seriously, reports say. Lebanese television pictures showed extensive damage to the area. The explosion is the fourth targeting Lebanon's mainly anti-Syrian Christian population in as many days. The last, on March 27, killed two people and wounded five others.

The explosion happened at about 9:45pm local time, at the 'Rizk Plaza' shopping mall. It is understood from local media that a bomb was placed in the underground parking area below the complex, although there has been no official confirmation from security services. Sources on the ground say that the actual commercial center occupied the ground floor, with upper stories occupied by inhabited apartments.

Located in the Metn range of mountains east of Beirut, Broummana is about half-hour's drive from the capital and is popular with tourists, particularly those from the Gulf states.

Earlier, the pro-Syrian Prime Minister Omar Karami had announced that he would not step down as he had previously announced before. He will instead attempt to form a unity government until the country's elections, due in May. The anti-Syrian opposition had refused to join his government and have instead demanded his resignation.

Lebanon has seen significant political unrest since the assassination of its former Prime Minister, Rafik Hariri, and the subsequent pullback of Syrian forces stationed in the country.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
From Thursday through Friday night in a sad spectacle of savagery, 30 innocent men, women and children were killed in &lt;a href="w%3ARio%20De%20Janeiro"&gt;Rio De Janeiro&lt;/a&gt; by criminals.

The killings occurred randomly at several places around the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro. The same death squad of criminals is suspected in all the killings. According to Rio's Public Security Secretary Marcelo Itajiba, outlaw police officers may be responsible for the crimes.

The criminals' actions might be a retaliation against recent arrests of policemen involved in fighting corruption and criminal activity.

In the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.estadao.com.br/cidades/noticias/2005/abr/01/164.htm"&gt;victims' list&lt;/a&gt; released by the police include six children from ages 13 to 16, and three victims older than 50. The remaining were aged 18 to 45. Some of the victims were just walking in the street, 11 were in a snack bar, and one boy was playing pinball when attacked. Other victims were found at random places around the city.

On Wednesday a group of outlaw policemen killed two people, beheading one of them.
The head was hurled in a direction towards the patio of the police station, the 15º Batalhão de Polícia Militar de Caxias, in Rio.

The announcement comes a day after Tawfik Tirawi, head of Palestinian Intelligence in the West Bank, resigned, saying that too little was being done to curb lawlessness by other security chiefs.

Haj Ismail, head of Palestinian national security in the West Bank, also resigned Friday after Abbas called for his resignation.

♡❤Reuters♡❤ quoted a Palestinian official as saying that Abbas "was not happy with the performance of some of the heads of security forces... and he will take other crucial measures in the near future."

&lt;a href="w%3AStand-up%20comedy"&gt;Stand-up comedian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMitch%20Hedberg"&gt;Mitch Hedberg&lt;/a&gt; was found dead Wednesday in his hotel room in &lt;a href="New%20Jersey"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;. The comedian, originally from the &lt;a href="w%3ASaint%20Paul%2C%20Minnesota"&gt;St. Paul, Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; region, was on an east coast tour of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;USA.&lt;/a&gt; Hedberg started his career in &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Florida"&gt;South Florida&lt;/a&gt;, and later worked in &lt;a href="w%3ASeattle"&gt;Seattle&lt;/a&gt;.

While the cause of Hedberg's death is yet unconfirmed, Hedberg's performance at a show in &lt;a href="w%3APortland%2C%20Maine"&gt;Portland, Maine&lt;/a&gt; in October 2004 suggested he might have a problem with drug use. According to Steve Kolowich of the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABowdoin%20College"&gt;Bowdoin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABowdoin%20Orient"&gt;Orient&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, "Hedberg, who was clearly intoxicated, was falling down all over the stage that night. At one point, he lay down behind the back curtain and told jokes for approximately ten minutes before rolling back into sight. He also asked the audience where the best bar in town was, and invited them to join him there after the show."

According to an ♡❤AP♡❤ report on KLTV.com, Hedberg's mother, Mary Hedberg, claimed speculation that her son's death was drug-related was "gossip." The same report notes that services will be held in &lt;a href="w%3AWoodbury%2C%20Minnesota"&gt;Woodbury, Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, April 5.

Hedberg, a frequent guest on &lt;a href="w%3ALate%20Night%20with%20David%20Letterman"&gt;Late Night with David Letterman&lt;/a&gt;, had released two CDs titled ♡❤Strategic Grill Locations♡❤ and♡❤ Mitch All Together♡❤. He also directed a movie, "Los Enchiladas!" The movie premiered at the &lt;a href="w%3ASundance%20Film%20Festival"&gt;Sundance Film Festival.&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; has plans to post a defence attaché to &lt;a href="NATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; headquarters in &lt;a href="Brussels"&gt;Brussels&lt;/a&gt;, and enhance counter-terrorism intelligence co-operation &amp;mdash; but will not be increasing troop numbers to assist the multilateral defence body in its task in &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;.

NATO chief &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJaap%20de%20Hoop%20Scheffer"&gt;Jaap de Hoop Scheffer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; suggested during a recent visit that more help in the troubled nation would be welcome. Australia currently supplies just one soldier to Afghanistan who assists in the clearance of landmines and unexploded ordnance. Up to 150 had at one time been on the ground there after the September 11 attack on the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Trade%20Center"&gt;World Trade Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , but were brought home by November 2002.

"We are facing terrorism everywhere and anywhere," Mr Scheffer said. "We are all facing – the NATO alliance, Australia and this region alike – the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. We are all faced with the consequences of fragile and failing states."

Defence Minister Robert Hill said a change of role for NATO, set up to counter the perceived threat from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACommunist%20Bloc"&gt;Communist Bloc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACold%20War"&gt;Cold War&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , meant Australia was likely to be working more closely with the organisation in the future. NATO now provides security in Afghanistan and trains &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;i personnel.
