<h1>FARC second-in-command killed by Colombian military</h1>

&lt;a href="w%3ARa%C3%BAl%20Reyes"&gt;Raúl Reyes&lt;/a&gt;, senior guerrilla commander and international spokesman of the &lt;a href="w%3ARevolutionary%20Armed%20Forces%20of%20Colombia"&gt;Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia&lt;/a&gt; (FARC), has been killed by &lt;a href="Colombia"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;n security forces in the southern province of &lt;a href="w%3APutumayo"&gt;Putumayo&lt;/a&gt;, the government said Saturday. 

Defense Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJuan%20Manuel%20Santos"&gt;Juan Manuel Santos&lt;/a&gt; confirmed his death in a press conference. He said that 16 other FARC rebels and one Colombian soldier were killed in the skirmish, which took place in a rebel stronghold near the border with &lt;a href="Ecuador"&gt;Ecuador&lt;/a&gt;.

"It is the hardest blow to FARC in all of its history", Santos said. Colombian security analyst Alfredo Rangel added, "This could hit morale [of the FARC] because the myth of the invulnerability of the bosses is over."

The military was able to locate the rebels by intercepting one of their satellite communications, he said. After launching an air strike on the rebel base, the Colombian military came under fire from the guerrilas. The military fired back, killing Reyes while in Ecuadorian territory. The bodies of the dead were then taken to Colombia.

"Once the camp was bombarded, Colombian forces were ordered in to secure the area and neutralize the enemy. The police was also asked to keep it secure until Ecuadoran authorities arrived," Santos said.

Colombian president &lt;a href="w%3AAlvaro%20Uribe"&gt;Alvaro Uribe&lt;/a&gt;, who was monitoring the operation, contacted Ecuadorian president &lt;a href="w%3ARafael%20Correa"&gt;Rafael Correa&lt;/a&gt; to inform him of the incident. "It appears the FARC entered Ecuadorean territory," Correa said. "The incident must be clarified a bit." Correa said he will send troops to the area for an investigation.

According to the Associated Press, Reyes, whose real name was Luis Edgar Devia Silva, was considered a contender for becoming leader of FARC. Their current leader, &lt;a href="w%3AManuel%20Marulanda"&gt;Manuel Marulanda&lt;/a&gt;, is believed to be in poor health.

Also killed in the fighting was Guillermo Enrique Torres, known by the alias of "Julián Conrado". He was a senior member of FARC who composed and performed revolutionary songs. 

FARC is considered a terrorist organization by Colombia, the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;. The group has been accused of &lt;a href="w%3Aillegal%20drug%20trade"&gt;drug trafficking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Aextortion"&gt;extortion&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3Akidnapping"&gt;kidnapping&lt;/a&gt;, among other illegal activities. The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20State"&gt;U.S. Department of State&lt;/a&gt; had offered a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;5 million bounty for information leading to the arrest of Reyes, as well as the other 6 members of the FARC's highest governing body.

While nearly all coverage of the 2008 &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; Presidential election has focused on the &lt;a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Democratic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; candidates, the race for the White House also includes independents and third party candidates. These parties represent a variety of views that may not be acknowledged by the major party platforms.

Wikinews has impartially reached out to these candidates, throughout the campaign. We now interview independent Presidential candidate &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJon%20Greenspon"&gt;Jon Greenspon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a veteran and small business executive.

<h2>Interview</h2>

♡❤♡Why do you want to be President?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Have you ever run for political office before? Have you ever been a member of a political party? Have you ever campaigned for another political candidate?♡❤♡

♡❤♡What is your current job? What skills or ideas do you bring from this position, or previous positions, that will benefit the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOval%20Office"&gt;Oval Office&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Obviously, the next American President and his or her administration will face many diverse issues. But if you were to narrow identify the three most important issues, what would they be? How will you address these issues?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Campaigning for the American presidency is one of the most expensive exercises in the world. How do you deal with the cost and fundraising?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Do you have a running mate yet? Who are they? What are you/were you looking for in a running mate?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Can you win the 2008 Presidential election? Can any third party or independent candidate ever win?♡❤♡

♡❤♡If you can't make it into the Oval Office, who would you prefer seeing taking the presidency?♡❤♡

♡❤♡What should the American people keep in mind, when heading to the polls this November?♡❤♡

Dr. &lt;a href="w%3AJoseph%20M.%20Juran"&gt;Joseph M. Juran&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aindustrial%20engineering"&gt;industrial engineer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APhilanthropist"&gt;philanthropist&lt;/a&gt;, has died from a stroke on February 28 at the age of 103.

He was born on December 24, 1904 in &lt;a href="w%3ABr%C4%83ila"&gt;Brăila&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Romania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;. In 1924, with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Minnesota"&gt;University of Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; (he would later earn a law degree), Juran joined Western Electric at the Hawthorne Works. His first job was in the inspection branch.

Juran was promoted to a managerial position in 1928, and the following year became a division chief. He would publish his first quality related article in Mechanical Engineering in 1935. In 1937 he moved to Western Electric/AT&amp;T's headquarters in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;.

After World War II, &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; was experiencing a crisis in mass manufactured product quality. Japanese goods were thought to be inexpensive, however, easily broken and in general poor quality. The Japanese Union of Scientists and Engineers (JUSE) recognized these issues and invited Juran to Japan in 1954.

Juran is survived by his wife Sadie Shapiro, 3 sons and 1 daughter.

The first part of the bi-lateral negotiations regarding the &lt;a href="w%3AMacedonia%20naming%20dispute"&gt;naming-dispute&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href="Greece"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AFormer%20Yugoslav%20Republic%20of%20Macedonia"&gt;Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia&lt;/a&gt;, under the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; mediation, ended without agreement in &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;. As the U.N. mediator Matthew Nimetz stated earlier there are "substantial differences" - and therefore important disagreements - between the two governments on his proposal made on 19 February, adding that during his separate meetings with the two ambassadors Vassilakis and Dimitrov on Friday, he was listened to the two sides’ questions and views on the issue.

Furthermore, it should be noted that the &lt;a href="NATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer will visit &lt;a href="w%3AAthens"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt; on Monday morning and he will meet with the Greek Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ACostas%20Karamanlis"&gt;Costas Karamanlis&lt;/a&gt; regarding the name-dispute between Greece and FYRO Macedonia. The Greek government has made clear that if there is no agreement between the two sides (over the official use of the name 'Macedonia') Athens will veto FYRO Macedonia's process in becoming a member of NATO. Yesterday, Karamanlis stated in a Parliament speech that Greece's ♡❤"will for a mutually accepted solution is genuine. Our position ’no solution-no invitation’, is clear. If no solution is reached, then our neighbouring country’s aspiration to join NATO will not be materialized. And this because the principle of good neighbourly relations is a fundamental condition for relations among allies"♡❤. 

Today, according to information presented in the News of the Greek TV station &lt;a href="w%3AMega%20Channel"&gt;Mega Channel&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; are pressing the Greek side for a quick solution in order to avoid any problems regarding the NATO invitation to Skopje. It should be noted that the government of FYRO Macedonia insists in the use of its constitutional name (Republic of Macedonia) while Greece suggests a composite name which would include a geographic term. A demonstration of nationalists was organized a few days ago in &lt;a href="w%3ASkopje"&gt;Skopje&lt;/a&gt;, while next week the &lt;a href="w%3Aright-wing"&gt;right wing&lt;/a&gt; Greek party &lt;a href="w%3APopular%20Orthodox%20Rally"&gt;LAOS&lt;/a&gt; organizes a rally in the city of &lt;a href="w%3AThessaloniki"&gt;Thessaloniki&lt;/a&gt; asking for national referendum and calling the government to use the right of veto.

The quake's &lt;a href="w%3Aepicenter"&gt;epicenter&lt;/a&gt; was located approximately 35 kilometers (21.7 miles) east, northeast of Iquique and had a depth of 35 km (21.7 miles).

According to the USGS, damage could be moderate, but so far there are no reports of damage, injuries or deaths. Some power outages were reported. Iquique has a population of over 227,000 people.

Support for one of the earliest popular web browsers, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANetscape%20Navigator"&gt;Netscape Navigator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , will be discontinued as of today. The browser, now owned by &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; internet services company &lt;a href="AOL"&gt;AOL&lt;/a&gt;, was once used by 90% of internet users, however the sharp decrease in usage to around 0.06% has lead to all support from AOL being stopped. 

The decision was said to be due to "AOL's current business focus and the success of the Mozilla Foundation."

The move was announced in December, and it was said that all support was to cease on February 1, 2008. This was extended until March 1, 2008 in order to allow AOL to "provide tools to ease the migration of existing Netscape browser users to ... alternatives" such as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMozilla%20Firefox"&gt;Mozilla Firefox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFlock%20%28browser%29"&gt;Flock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The decision means that there will no longer be any security patch updates, or new functions for the browser.

He was born on February 16, 1904 in &lt;a href="Lithuania"&gt;Lithuania&lt;/a&gt; to a Jewish family and died on February 28, 2008, aged 104.
Rabinowitz finished in a time of 30.86 seconds; breaking the previous mark of 36.19 set by Erwin Jaskulski of Austria. A week before, the centenarian broke the record, but a faulty electronic timer kept the mark out of the books.

For comparison, the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20record%20progression%20100%20metres%20men"&gt;world record for the men's 100 meters&lt;/a&gt; —9.74 seconds— was set by &lt;a href="w%3AAsafa%20Powell"&gt;Asafa Powell&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Jamaica"&gt;Jamaica&lt;/a&gt; at the age of 24.

<h1>Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas cuts ties with Israel</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Palestinian%20President%20Mahmoud%20Abbas%20cuts%20ties%20with%20Israel&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The President of &lt;a href="Palestine"&gt;Palestine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Mahmoud%20Abbas"&gt;Mahmoud Abbas&lt;/a&gt; has cut all diplomatic ties and relations with &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; including any and all communications.

Abbas made his decision after recent Israeli crackdown on Palestinian militants has left over 100 people dead and dozens injured. On Saturday March 1, 70 Palestinians were killed in clashes. At least two soldiers of the Israeli Defense Force were also killed. 

Abbas says that he will continue his silence towards Israel until "all aggression" against Palestine is stopped.

"The negotiations are suspended, as are all contacts on all levels, because in light of the Israeli aggression such communication has no meaning. The Israeli government has decided to prosecute an unjust war and the open slaughter of our people. It bears sole responsibility for the hindering the peace process and all the effects and consequences of this decision," said Nabil Abu Rudeina, a spokesman for Abbas in a statement to the media.

According to reports by ♡❤Africasia♡❤ quoting &lt;a href="w%3AAgence%20France-Presse"&gt;Agence France-Presse&lt;/a&gt; (AFP), Israel calls the move by Abbas a mistake.

"Suspending peace talks is a mistake and it gives the keys to the negotiations to &lt;a href="w%3AHamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt;," said an Israeli official to AFP who was not named.

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; among other nations have called for Israel to stop its strikes, but Prime Minister &lt;a href="Ehud%20Olmert"&gt;Ehud Olmert&lt;/a&gt; said that "nothing will prevent us from continuing operations to protect our citizens."

&lt;a href="Finland"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt; is to be represented at the &lt;a href="w%3AEurovision%20Song%20Contest"&gt;Eurovision Song Contest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AEurovision%20Song%20Contest%202008"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="w%3Aheavy%20metal"&gt;heavy metal&lt;/a&gt; band &lt;a href="w%3ATer%C3%A4sbetoni"&gt;Teräsbetoni&lt;/a&gt; with their song ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMiss%C3%A4%20miehet%20ratsastaa"&gt;Missä Miehet Ratsastaa&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ (♡❤Where Men Ride♡❤).

Teräsbetoni picked up 38.9% of the vote, with &lt;a href="w%3AKari%20Tapio"&gt;Kari Tapio&lt;/a&gt; second at 33.9% and &lt;a href="w%3ACristal%20Snow"&gt;Cristal Snow&lt;/a&gt; came third with 26.5%. The selection show was arranged as three qualifying rounds, with two songs selected to go through from each. The remainder competed again amongst themselves for one wild card position, then it went to the public vote.

Teräsbetoni will compete on May 20 in the first of the Eurovision semi finals for a place in the final. Both events will be held in &lt;a href="w%3ABelgrade"&gt;Belgrade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Serbia"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt;.

Finland won the contest in 2006 when &lt;a href="w%3Ahard%20rock"&gt;hard rock&lt;/a&gt; band &lt;a href="Lordi"&gt;Lordi&lt;/a&gt;'s ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AHard%20Rock%20Hallelujah"&gt;Hard Rock Hallelujah&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ scored a record 292 points. However, the following year in &lt;a href="w%3AHelsinki"&gt;Helsinki&lt;/a&gt; Finnish entrant &lt;a href="w%3AHanna%20Pakarinen"&gt;Hanna Pakarinen&lt;/a&gt;'s ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALeave%20Me%20Alone%20%28Hanna%20Pakarinen%20song%29"&gt;Leave Me Alone&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ finished outside the qualifying positions for this year's contest at number 17, with 53 points, meaning that if Teräsbetoni are to make the final they will have to qualify.

♡❤Missä Miehet Ratsastaa♡❤ was released as a single by &lt;a href="w%3AWarner%20Music%20Finland"&gt;Warner Music Finland&lt;/a&gt; on February 2.

Musician &lt;a href="w%3AJeff%20Healey"&gt;Jeff Healey&lt;/a&gt;, 41, has died in &lt;a href="Toronto"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; from cancer, it was announced Sunday. Healey is internationally known for his 1988 album ♡❤See the Light♡❤ and for his appearance the following year in the movie ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ARoad%20House%20%281989%20film%29"&gt;Road House&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ with &lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Swayze"&gt;Patrick Swayze&lt;/a&gt;. His hits included ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAngel%20Eyes%20%28The%20Jeff%20Healey%20Band%20song%29"&gt;Angel Eyes&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

He was born Norman Jeffery Healey on March 25, 1966 in Toronto. At the age of 1, he was blinded from &lt;a href="w%3Aretinoblastoma"&gt;retinoblastoma&lt;/a&gt;, but still learned how to play the guitar by positioning the instrument on his lap.

Healey was host of various Canadian radio programs in recent years and was set to release a new blues-rock album within weeks. He is survived by his wife and two children, 13-year-old Rachel and 3-year-old Derek.

The website &lt;a href="w%3Awikileaks.org"&gt;wikileaks.org&lt;/a&gt; has recently been brought back online following the lifting of a court injunction forcing the site to be taken down. According to a Wikileaks press release from when the site was taken offline, the injunction stated that "&lt;a href="w%3ADynadot"&gt;Dynadot&lt;/a&gt; [Wikileaks host] shall immediately clear and remove all DNS hosting records for the wikileaks.org domain name and prevent the domain name from resolving to the wikileaks.org website or any other website or server other than a blank park page, until further order of this Court."

As Wikleaks is a wiki and is therefore not run by anyone, Jonathon Winterview interviewed a spokesperson of Wikileaks, who answered all the below questions.
<h2>Interview</h2>

♡❤♡What do you believe Judge Whites reasoning was for lifting the injunction?

♡❤♡Bank Julius Baer have claimed in a recent press release that they did not wish for wikileaks.org to be taken off line. Do you believe the claims in this statement? If not, why not?

♡❤♡Do you believe Bank Julius Baer will suffer as a result taking Wikileaks to court?

♡❤♡Bank Julius Baer have said that they were not able to negotiate with Wikileaks. Is this true?

A representative of the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union"&gt;American Civil Liberties Union&lt;/a&gt; (ACLU), which supported Wikileaks, has told ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ their opinion of the court injunction. They have claimed that the lifting of the injunction was a "victory for the first amendment."

The representative stated that the ACLU hopes this injunction acts as an example to other judges who take part in similar cases. This opinion was shown when the representative said that the lifting of the injunction will "hopefully help show other courts that injunctions against speech, including speech on the Internet, are not appropriate."

The permanent injunction was granted in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Northern%20District%20of%20California"&gt;California Northern District Court&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco%2C%20California"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3AJulius%20Baer%20Group"&gt;Bank Julius Baer&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="Switzerland"&gt;Swiss&lt;/a&gt; bank, which has caused the domain to be taken off line in the U.S..Wikileaks previously published several documents obtained from a whistleblower of the Swiss Bank, "purportedly showing offshore tax evasion and money laundering by extremely wealthy and in some cases, politically sensitive, clients from the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Peru"&gt;Peru&lt;/a&gt;."

"Blocking access to the entire site in response to a few documents posted there completely disregards the public's right to know," said Ann Brick a lawyer for the ACLU, in a statement made before the injunction was lifted. At least 18 other organizations have signed documents in defense of Wikileaks. Those documents have been forged into a joint &lt;a href="w%3Aamicus%20curiae"&gt;amicus curiae&lt;/a&gt; ("friend of the court") brief; which will be submitted to the court and used as defense evidence in a hearing scheduled for Friday February 29.

Marsden had contacted Wales two years ago about concerns she had over the article about her on Wikipedia, and Wales determined the article was not compliant with Wikipedia's standards. The tech blog &lt;a href="w%3AValleywag"&gt;Valleywag&lt;/a&gt; revealed Wales had a personal relationship with Marsden, and posted supposed transcripts of their instant message conversations on its site, www.valleywag.com. Wales and Marsden met in February, and ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Times"&gt;The Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reported that "An apparent transcript of their conversations before that meeting suggests that, although Mr Wales had withdrawn from the editing process, he was still influencing the editors." ♡❤The Times♡❤ quoted Wales from the chat logs as having stated to Marsden "The truth is of course a much worse conflict of interest than that; but that will do." — in reference to his conflict of interest regarding Marsden's article on Wikipedia.

Wales posted a public statement on Saturday on Wikipedia addressing the matter, and stated that his relationship with Marsden was over: "First, while I find it hard to imagine that anyone really cares about my sex life, the facts are: I am separated from my wife. I considered myself single at the time of my one meeting with Rachel Marsden on Feb. 9, 2008 ... I am no longer involved with Rachel Marsden. Gossipy stories suggesting that I have been in a relationship with her 'since last fall' are completely false ... I care deeply about the integrity of Wikipedia, and take very seriously my responsibilities as a member of the board and as a member of the Wikipedia community. I would never knowingly do anything to compromise that trust." With regard to the conflict of interest in Marsden's article, Wales had acknowledged to a team of Wikipedia editors in February 2008 that he and Marsden "became friends ... and that we would be meeting about that," and stated "I recused myself from any further official action with respect to her biography."

On Sunday, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Canadian%20Press"&gt;The Canadian Press&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reported that Marsden had posted photos of herself on &lt;a href="w%3AEbay"&gt;Ebay&lt;/a&gt;, and was selling items that Wales had left at her &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; apartment. In her Ebay posting, Marsden stated: "Hi, my name is Rachel and my (now ex-) boyfriend, Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales, just broke up with me via an announcement on Wikipedia ... It was such a classy move that I was inspired to do something equally classy myself, so I'm selling a couple of items of clothing he left behind, here in my NYC apartment, on eBay. Jimbo was supposed to come visit me in a couple of weeks and pick up some of his stuff, but obviously that won't be happening now." Marsden told ♡❤The Canadian Press♡❤ "It didn't really help matters that Jimmy chose to announce the breakup to the entire world via Wikipedia (which apparently now is an online encyclopedia that doubles as a personal soapbox?) rather than to me directly (which he did much later, in an instant message discussion)."
Marsden placed a t-shirt and sweater which she said were left at her apartment by Wales up on Ebay, and started the bidding for each at ninety-nine cents, with the auctions set to end on March 12. By Monday, bidding on the t-shirt had reached &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;300, and by Tuesday the highest bid had reached $12,200. In an email to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Globe%20and%20Mail"&gt;The Globe and Mail&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, Marsden stated "My only focus right now, to be really honest, is on my career and finding a way to get back into print, TV, or radio here in NYC," she wrote. "All of this other personal stuff is just an unfortunate distraction."

&lt;a href="w%3AJay%20Walsh"&gt;Jay Walsh&lt;/a&gt;, the Wikimedia Foundation's head of communications, told the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Jose%20Mercury%20News"&gt;San Jose Mercury News&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that Wales' actions in relaying Marsden's concerns about her Wikipedia article to a team of trusted editors was within his "routine" role. When asked by the ♡❤San Jose Mercury News♡❤ if Wales' actions regarding the Marsden article could compromise his role with the Wikimedia Foundation and Wikipedia, Walsh responded "No, absolutely not."

On Tuesday, ABC News carried a story by ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWired%20News"&gt;Wired News&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reporter Megan McCarthy regarding allegations of "excessive spending" by Wales, and Associated Press also reported on questions involving Wikimedia Foundation expenses. McCarthy reported that former Wikimedia executive &lt;a href="w%3ADanny%20Wool"&gt;Danny Wool&lt;/a&gt;, who had left the foundation last year, criticized Wales' use of Wikimedia Foundation expenses in a blog post. Wool stated that Wales had tried to expense $300 bottles of wine, a $1,300 dinner for four at a Florida steakhouse, and visits to Moscow massage parlors to the foundation, and that the foundation rescinded Wales' corporate credit card in 2006. Wool also stated that Wales paid the foundation $7,000, after being short $30,000 on receipts for expenses. 

Wool told EPICENTER that "There were occasions where he used [the Wikimedia Foundation] for personal advancement under the guide [♡❤sic♡❤] of the mission. And, as someone who was in there for the mission part of it, I found that rather distressful." Wool commented in an interview with the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco%20Chronicle"&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/a&gt;♡❤: "Originally, it was carelessness ... But as things developed, it became more apparent and obvious that he was taking advantage of the foundation credit card. It was almost like his personal piggy bank."
In an instant message exchange with Associated Press, Wales denied that the Wikimedia Foundation had taken away his corporate credit card, and asserted that he had made the decision to stop expensing business travel for the foundation. Wales highlighted a statement by the foundation's executive director &lt;a href="w%3ASue%20Gardner"&gt;Sue Gardner&lt;/a&gt;: "Jimmy has never used Wikimedia money to subsidize his personal expenditures. Indeed, he has consistently put the foundation's interests ahead of his own." In an email to Associated Press, Brad Patrick, a former attorney for the Wikimedia Foundation, stated "Danny seems interested in blogging his way straight to a lawsuit". 

&lt;a href="w%3AFlorence%20Devouard"&gt;Florence Devouard&lt;/a&gt;, who chairs the Wikimedia Foundation, told Associated Press that Wales had been "slow in submitting receipts," and that the foundation had rejected Wales' expense at the Florida steakhouse. Devouard told fellow foundation board members in a private email that she had convinced Associated Press that "the money story was a no story," and told Wales "I find (it) tiring to see how you are constantly trying to rewrite the past. Get a grip!" Wales told Associated Press: "The board, the current executive director, the previous executive director, and independent auditors have reviewed our books and publicly agree that all of my expenses were appropriate and fully accounted for."

Media reports speculated on how the controversy would end up being represented in Wikipedia itself. On Wednesday, the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Petersburg%20Times"&gt;St. Petersburg Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ wrote: "Wales' Wikipedia page said only this about Marsden: 'Wales had a brief relationship with Canadian journalist Rachel Marsden.'" An article in ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Australian"&gt;The Australian&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ surmised: "History will decide whether Mr Wales broke his own principles, but before that happens there may well be a Wikipedia page devoted to the controversy."

While nearly all coverage of the 2008 Presidential election has focused on the Democratic and Republican candidates, the race for the White House also includes independents and third party candidates. These parties represent a variety of views that may not be acknowledged by the major party platforms.

Wikinews has impartially reached out to these candidates, throughout the campaign. We now interview independent Presidential candidate &lt;a href="w%3AFrank%20Moore%20%28performance%20artist%29"&gt;Frank Moore&lt;/a&gt;, a performance artist.

<h2>Interview</h2>
♡❤♡Why do you want to be President?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Have you ever run for political office before? Have you ever been a member of a political party? Have you ever campaigned for another political candidate?♡❤♡

♡❤♡What is your current job? What skills or ideas do you bring from this position, or previous positions, that will benefit the Oval Office?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Obviously, the next American President and his or her administration will face many diverse issues. But if you were to narrow identify the three most important issues, what would they be? How will you address these issues?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Campaigning for the American presidency is one of the most expensive exercises in the world. How do you deal with the cost and fundraising?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Do you have a running mate yet? Who are they? What are you/were you looking for in a running mate?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Can you win the 2008 Presidential election? Can any third party or independent candidate ever win?♡❤♡

♡❤♡If you can't make it into the Oval Office, who would you prefer seeing taking the presidency?♡❤♡

♡❤♡What should the American people keep in mind, when heading to the polls this November?♡❤♡

In light of his recent appointment to the board, ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ conducted the following interview with Domas Mituzas.

<h4>Interview</h4>

♡❤♡Congratulations on your new board position! Can you tell us a bit about your background - previous work with the Foundation, what you do with MySQL AB etc?

♡❤♡Domas Mituzas♡❤♡: Thanks! Though my first edits to Wikipedia were in 2003, I became actively involved in site technology back in 2004. Then I was working for a major IT company in the &lt;a href="w%3ABaltic%20States"&gt;Baltic States&lt;/a&gt;, and was leading the systems group there. Back then I could apply quite a bit of practice I had from my job to maintain &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; in its technology infancy. It became increasingly involving, and eventually the things we started doing became far more complex, especially when the exploding growth hit us. Managing the growth and sustaining the site up was quite stressful at that time, and we started both lots of optimization and resource expansion work. Eventually I got involved in the &lt;a href="w%3AMySQL"&gt;MySQL&lt;/a&gt; community, and was suggested to apply for a job in MySQL AB. There I work in services division, assisting our customers with their problems, helping to grow their operations. Now as part of company acquisition I'm joining &lt;a href="w%3ASun%20Microsystems"&gt;Sun Microsystems&lt;/a&gt;, and I'm eager to see what possibilities can that provide. 

Back in my childhood I was deep into encyclopedias, first dead tree ones, later CDs and online version of &lt;a href="w%3ABritannica"&gt;Britannica&lt;/a&gt;. I had a dream, that once I get my own home, I'll get full dead-tree version of Britannica on my bookshelves. It didn't happen, as I got into Wikipedia the same year I bought my apartment. Life is full of irony :-)

Actually, back in 2000 I approached university professor and tried to explain him a concept of dynamically edited news repository, where every concept could be explained deeper and deeper into elemental knowledge particles, and later that can be assembled in many dynamic ways. His first question was "Is that some kind of website?", and I was angry at him for not getting the generic concept of knowledge at all. Year or two afterwards I was discussing same concepts with a colleague, and he provided with far more practical visions of all that. Seeing Wikipedia for the very first time was a dejavu, so it was easy to get into the project. That is different from what I imagined, but far more useful.

♡❤♡Why do you think you were chosen for this position, and what do you think you can contribute?

♡❤♡DM♡❤♡: One of reasons was both my long-term presence in site operations and communicating about our work, spreading our ideology, providing opinions. I try to be able to explain difficult topics in human language, and that is quite well appreciated. Additionally, I was being a bit of outsider - more of a reader than writer, so I feel that my views are slightly less community centric, more of value centric. My experience in a technology team is quite similar to what I expect to see in the board - wide array of issues to work on, and maintaining consensus is incredibly important to keep the productivity high. So even though I have deep roots in the project, I feel that I can bring in lots of fresh ways to the board. Of course, I will try to provide best possible technology advise, if the board needs it.

♡❤♡Will you continue doing your previous technical work at the same time? If you do, how will you find a balance?

♡❤♡DM♡❤♡: I would really avoid to do all previous work - but it is not needed any more. Years ago we were monitoring the site 24/7, shortage of resources was causing all sorts of difficult problems. Now everything is way more steady and reliable, so I have way much more free time. I used to do lots of other activities too, so I think I can scale my time just fine. And still, of course, I'll provide as much work to technical part as needed, it just isn't as demanding as it used to be, and we're really happy about that.

♡❤♡What major actions do you expect to come your way during your term in office?

♡❤♡DM♡❤♡: Though my term is quite short for now (until June elections), the biggest work will be done in understanding how the foundation should function to establish a really long-term presence, to support the projects far into the future. It may need changes in how we get external experience, how we interact with other organizations, how we do interact with office staff and each other. Foundation did lots of work to get to stable and reliable state, now it is time to think more about the future sustainability and expansion.

I have operations experience, so of course I will want to maintain high efficiency of overall operation, but on the other hand I want to work on scaling other parts of the foundation - especially reach out, evangelism, and of course - fundraising. 

♡❤♡Do you expect any major upgrades to be needed to hardware or software anytime soon, and if so what?

♡❤♡DM♡❤♡: Projects are always growing - pages, pageviews, revisions, users, media, archives - to facilitate that there will always be major upgrades. We still have some of the solutions that allowed us to survive for years, but are not suitable for a whole millennium. There will always be new features, that will need more resources, so we definitely won't stop improving our hardware or software platform. I have to take off the board member hat to answer these questions, as they should be really directed to technology team, instead of board. I won't mention exact projects, but we have a trail of features that have to be implemented, and will be, soon. But indeed, that is very much operational issue, that the technology team and foundation staff is known to handle well.

♡❤♡What do you expect lies ahead for the Foundation in the long run - say, the next ten years?

♡❤♡DM♡❤♡: My generation is already forming the 'Wikimedia Alumni' - the readers, consumers of our content love us. It is amazing to realize what powers they may have in the next ten years, and how they will be able to assist us.

The biggest work to be done - maintaining the loyalty of our community, continue being the good guys of the Internet. Next ten years will be years of continued Internet penetration, and us being the major beneficial part of that process is especially exciting.

I really want to believe, that our offline activities will be just an intermediate step, and we will have whole world using our online resources, and of course - contributing to them.

Also, I'm not sure if we will be capable to achieve in next ten years, but besides digital divide, we will have to break information isolationism that certain countries or communities maintain - and the best way to achieve it is by providing the best knowledge resource possible. Opening up communities and having them work together may really become the next great wonder of the world. Who doesn't want to be part of that? :)

<h1>Colombian police claim that Venezuelan government paid FARC rebels $300 million</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Colombian%20police%20claim%20that%20Venezuelan%20government%20paid%20FARC%20rebels%20%24300%20million&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Speaking at a press conference Monday, &lt;a href="Colombia"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;'s national police chief Gen. Oscar Naranjo said evidence from the computers of slain members of the &lt;a href="w%3ARevolutionary%20Armed%20Forces%20of%20Colombia"&gt;Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia&lt;/a&gt; (FARC) suggests the &lt;a href="Venezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;n government recently paid the militant guerrilla group US$300 million. He suggested that this may have been part of a deal to release several hostages held by the FARC. 

"This unmasks the relations of the FARC with a series of governments, with a series of personalities, some public, some more sinister," Naranjo said. A representative of the &lt;a href="Ecuador"&gt;Ecuador&lt;/a&gt;ian government may have been involved with the organization as well, he says, though Ecuadorian president &lt;a href="w%3ARafael%20Correa"&gt;Rafael Correa&lt;/a&gt; has already denied these charges.

"They said we had a pact with terrorists, and that is completely false," Correa said during a Cabinet meeting. "We are dealing with an extremely cynical government."

The police chief also said there was evidence of the Venezuelan government offering to help supply rifles and of 50 kilograms of &lt;a href="w%3Auranium"&gt;uranium&lt;/a&gt; to FARC. To verify the evidence, the police chief said he will send the documents to the &lt;a href="w%3AOrganization%20of%20American%20States"&gt;Organization of American States&lt;/a&gt;, who will meet in &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday to discuss the South American situation. 

In addition, he says there is evidence that FARC had given U$150,000 to &lt;a href="Hugo%20Ch%C3%A1vez"&gt;Hugo Chávez&lt;/a&gt; in 1992 when he was a jailed rebel leader. "A note recovered from Raúl Reyes speaks of how grateful Chávez was for the 100 million pesos that the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, delivered to Chávez when he was in prison," Naranjo said. 

Colombia, &lt;a href="Venezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Ecuador"&gt;Ecuador&lt;/a&gt; are involved in a conflict over the killing on Saturday of FARC spokesman Luis Edgar Devia Silva, also known as &lt;a href="w%3ARa%C3%BAl%20Reyes"&gt;Raúl Reyes&lt;/a&gt;. Colombian security forces conducted a raid that extended into Ecuadorian territory.

Venezuela and Ecuador have ordered troops to the border with Colombia and have pulled their diplomats from the capital Bogota.

"We will not permit this outrage," said Rafael Correa. "The situation is extremely grave, and the Ecuadoran government is disposed to go to the ultimate consequences." President of Venezuela Hugo Chávez said the act was a "cowardly murder" and insulted Colombian President &lt;a href="w%3AAlvaro%20Uribe"&gt;Alvaro Uribe&lt;/a&gt; as a liar, criminal and gangster.

Colombia says it has decided not to send extra troops to its borders or sever diplomatic ties with either of the two countries, Uribe said that his fight was against FARC and not any of these countries.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
[Jingle] This is Wikinews News Brief, summarising the current news on Tuesday the 4th of March 2008 at 05:00 hours UTC. I’m Nicholas Turnbull. [Jingle]

<h3>Events of worldwide notability, military action, disasters etc.</h3>

<h4>&lt;a href="Computer%20documents%20suggest%20link%20between%20Chavez%20and%20FARC"&gt;Computer documents suggest link between Chavez and FARC&lt;/a&gt;</h4>

The national police chief of Columbia, Oscar Naranjo [pr: na-ran-HO], stated at a press conference yesterday that documentary evidence has been obtained that links Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez [pr: oo-go cha-vez] with the far-left Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, commonly referred to as the FARC [pr: f-a-r-c]. The documents were apparently found on computers belonging to FARC rebels who were killed in recent Columbian military attacks on the Marxist-Leninist guerrilla organisation. Naranjo told press sources that the evidence suggests that Chávez had recently paid $300 million US dollars to the rebels, and declared a suspicion that the money may have been part of an arrangement to secure the release of several hostages held by the organisation. The evidence also allegedly suggests that the Venezuelan government has offered to supply the organisation with uranium and firearms and that a member of the Ecuadorian government had ties with them. The Ecuadorean government has denied allegations by Columbia of complicity in the activities of the FARC.

<h4>&lt;a href="Medvedev%20becomes%20Russian%20president-elect"&gt;Medvedev becomes Russian president-elect&lt;/a&gt;</h4>

Dmitry Medvedev [pr:der-mee-der-ree mid-vay-dev] has won the presidency of the Russian Federation in Sunday's election, winning 70.21% of the overall vote, in which turnout amongst registered voters was 69.65%. Medvedev replaces current president Vladimir Putin, who has served two 4-year presidential terms since his election in 2000. Medvedev is Putin's chosen successor, and has made promises to continue the strategies employed by the current Russian government. Medvedev is considered as more pro-democratic and less nationalistic in his political stance as compared to Putin, and is currently Putin's chief of staff. The fairness of the election has been called into question, with the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe refusing to monitor the election on the basis that restrictions imposed by the Russian government would have made the assessment meaningless. The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe considered the elections to be neither free nor fair. It is thought that Vladimir Putin will assume the role of Prime Minister.

<h4>&lt;a href="At%20least%2040%20killed%20by%20bombing%20in%20Pakistan"&gt;At least 40 killed by bombing in Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;</h4>
In north-west Pakistan, over 40 people were killed and several were injured on Sunday, in a bomb attack on the outskirts of Dara Adamkel. The town is near to the country's border with Afghanistan and is approximately 40 kilometres away from the provincial capital of Peshawar. The explosion occurred during a tribal meeting on the subject of security. A spokesman for the Pakistan Interior Ministry stated that the Ministry was currently trying to gather information on the incident and added that initial reports suggested a suicide attack, which remain unconfirmed by official sources.

<h4>&lt;a href="United%20Nations%20condemns%20Palestinian%20rocket%20attacks%20and%20Israel%27s%20%27disproportionate%27%20response"&gt;United Nations condemns Palestinian rocket attacks and Israel's 'disproportionate' response&lt;/a&gt;</h4>

The Secretary General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-Moon, expressed consternation at Israel's use of excessive force against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, whilst also calling for the immediate cessation of rocket attacks by Palestine, in an address to the United Nations Security Council on Sunday. Israeli troops killed 61 people on Saturday, including eight children, in an offensive attack carried out in response to a spate of Palestinian rocket attacks on locations within Israel. Libya has requested agreement to a draft to condemn Israel's killing of Palestinian civilians, although diplomatic sources believe that it will not be passed unless a similar condemnation is made of Palestinian rocket fire on Israel.

<h3>Non-disastrous local events with notable impact and dead celebrities</h3>

<h4>&lt;a href="Canadian%20musician%20Jeff%20Healey%20dies%20of%20cancer"&gt;Canadian musician Jeff Healey dies of cancer&lt;/a&gt;</h4>

Canadian Musician Jeff Healey, aged 41, died in Toronto on Sunday following a long battle with cancer. Healey became internationally known for his 1988 album entitled ♡❤See the Light♡❤ and for his appearance the following year in the movie Road House with Patrick Swayze. His hits included "Angel Eyes". Blind from the age of 1, Healey learned how to play the guitar by positioning it on his lap. He is survived by his wife and two children.

<h4>&lt;a href="Nepali%20goddess%20retires%20at%20age%2011"&gt;Nepali goddess retires at age 11&lt;/a&gt;</h4>

The controversial "living goddess" of Nepal, 11-year-old Sajani Shakya, has retired from her status as the Kumari of Bhaktapur at the request of her family, according to Dipak Pandey, a senior official of the state-run Trust Corporation of Nepal's cultural affairs. According to Pandey, Shakya's family desires to carry out a religious ritual involving a symbolic wedding with a bael fruit, that is intended to ensure the girl will not be treated as a widow if their husband dies before she does. Nepal, a deeply religious nation, believes that Kumari are living incarnations of the goddess Kali, and they must be chosen by the indigenous Newa people by passing ritual tests and having certain physical attributes.

<h1>Conservatives in Alberta, Canada re-elected 11th consecutive time</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Conservatives%20in%20Alberta%2C%20Canada%20re-elected%2011th%20consecutive%20time&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3AEd%20Stelmach"&gt;Ed Stelmach&lt;/a&gt; was celebrating victory on Monday as he was expected to be re-elected Premier in the &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; province of &lt;a href="Alberta"&gt;Alberta&lt;/a&gt;. Vote results indicate a solid majority of legislative seats for Stelmach's &lt;a href="w%3AProgressive%20Conservative%20Association%20of%20Alberta"&gt;Progressive Conservatives&lt;/a&gt;, an 11th consecutive election victory for his party.

Stelmach, who succeeded &lt;a href="w%3ARalph%20Klein"&gt;Ralph Klein&lt;/a&gt; as party leader and Premier in 2006, defeated &lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Taft"&gt;Kevin Taft&lt;/a&gt;'s opposition Liberals by winning a substantial majority of the provincial legislature seats. New Democrat &lt;a href="w%3ABrian%20Mason"&gt;Brian Mason&lt;/a&gt; was leading in his &lt;a href="w%3AEdmonton"&gt;Edmonton&lt;/a&gt; riding, although his party is expected to win few seats.

The &lt;a href="w%3AWildrose%20Alliance%20Party%20of%20Alberta"&gt;Wildrose Alliance Party&lt;/a&gt; was only formed in January, the result of a merger of the &lt;a href="w%3AWildrose%20Party%20of%20Alberta"&gt;Wildrose&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAlberta%20Alliance%20Party"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; parties.

<h1>Highlights of 2008 Taipei County Jin Shi Marathon</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Highlights%20of%202008%20Taipei%20County%20Jin%20Shi%20Marathon&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The 2008 Taipei County ♡❤Jin Shi International Marathon♡❤ which was established in 1979 and suspended from 1986 to 2001 before being transformed from "Jin Shan" to "Jin Shi" with its racing scale expanded, crossed through three townships including &lt;a href="w%3AWanli%2C%20Taipei"&gt;Wanli&lt;/a&gt;, Jinshan, and &lt;a href="w%3AShihmen%2C%20Taipei"&gt;Shihmen&lt;/a&gt; was held last Sunday (March 2 in &lt;a href="w%3ATime%20in%20China"&gt;Taipei Time&lt;/a&gt;). Not only professional runners from &lt;a href="Asia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;n and &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;European&lt;/a&gt; countries participated in this race, but several enterprises, governmental and academic teams also supported this race by participating in 6K Fun Run classes.

Even though the &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Weather%20Bureau"&gt;Central Weather Bureau&lt;/a&gt; warned of an impending &lt;a href="w%3Adust%20storm"&gt;dust storm&lt;/a&gt;, good weather graced this race with rain-free conditions. Another challenge for the runners in the 21K and 42K classes was cold winds due to the race route partially including coast line.

Finally, &lt;a href="Belgium"&gt;Belgian&lt;/a&gt; marathon runner &lt;a href="w%3Anl%3ARik%20Ceulemans"&gt;Rik Ceulemans&lt;/a&gt;, men's record holder of this race, extended his record with 2H18m13s to win the men's championship, and Yu-fang Hsu, women's champion of 2007 ING Taipei Marathon, won her title at women's class with 2H53m39s. Coincidently, Wen-chien Wu and Wan-ling Wu, former champions of this race, all won the second place in their own gender class.

As a recap for the race, not only runners gave their best performances in this race, but several foreign teams — especially from &lt;a href="w%3AOkinawa"&gt;Okinawa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; — played a great role adding a cultural exchange aspect to the event. Bros Sports, the race organizer, supervised by Taipei County Government in this race, some senior managers from Bros Sports hoped organizations from the sports industry could arrange the best integration of several marathon races in Taiwan in the future even though Bros Sports promoted a special attempt this year with three marathon races including Jin Shi, &lt;a href="w%3ADajia%2C%20Taichung"&gt;Dajia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMazu%20%28goddess%29"&gt;Mazu&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Microelectronics%20Corporation"&gt;UMC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AHsinchu"&gt;Hsinchu&lt;/a&gt; stages.

Ernest &lt;a href="w%3AGary%20Gygax"&gt;Gary Gygax&lt;/a&gt;, co-creator of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ADungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons"&gt;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, died in his &lt;a href="w%3ALake%20Geneva%2C%20Wisconsin"&gt;Lake Geneva, Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt; home on Tuesday at the age of 69 due to heart problems.

&lt;a href="w%3ADave%20Arneson"&gt;Dave Arneson's&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABlackmoor"&gt;Blackmoor&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ was the first &lt;a href="w%3Arole-playing%20game"&gt;role-playing game&lt;/a&gt;, a genre in which players describe their characters in thorough detail and can attempt almost any action the character plausibly could. Gygax, then a close friend of Arneson, worked with him during 1972-73 to develop the extensive set of rules (in this case three volumes) that such a game requires. This became the first edition of ♡❤Dungeons &amp; Dragons♡❤. He also fleshed out the default setting for the game, a "sword-and-sorcery" world inspired primarily by fantasy fiction such as &lt;a href="w%3AThree%20Hearts%20and%20Three%20Lions"&gt;Three Hearts and Three Lions&lt;/a&gt;. He then founded &lt;a href="w%3ATSR%20Inc."&gt;TSR Inc.&lt;/a&gt; to publish the game; although it was a runaway success, financial difficulties ultimately forced the company to sell itself to &lt;a href="w%3AWizards%20of%20the%20Coast"&gt;Wizards of the Coast&lt;/a&gt;, which currently publishes the game and is now a subsidiary of &lt;a href="w%3AHasbro"&gt;Hasbro&lt;/a&gt;.

Although not involved with later editions of ♡❤D&amp;D♡❤, Gygax later worked on other role-playing games and wrote fantasy novels. He also designed niche-market board games.

♡❤Dungeons &amp; Dragons♡❤ is considered a tabletop RPG, since it is played with pen, paper, dice and miniature figures. It inspired other tabletop RPGs (such as ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AGURPS"&gt;GURPS&lt;/a&gt;♡❤), as well as video RPGs (such as the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AFinal%20Fantasy"&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ series). The most recent form of RPG is the &lt;a href="w%3Amassively-multiplayer%20online%20roleplaying%20game"&gt;massively-multiplayer online roleplaying game&lt;/a&gt;, such as ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20of%20Warcraft"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. An estimated 20 million people worldwide have played the game. Magazines, print and web comics and independent bands have been dedicated to the game, as have thousands of fan websites.

Gygax's death comes mere months before the scheduled release of the 4th Edition of ♡❤D&amp;D♡❤ in June, as well as a scheduled "GM Day" among ♡❤D&amp;D♡❤ fans on the internet.

<h1>Northern Ireland's Ian Paisley to resign and retire</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Northern%20Ireland%27s%20Ian%20Paisley%20to%20resign%20and%20retire&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AFirst%20Minister%20of%20Northern%20Ireland"&gt;First Minister of Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt; and leader of the &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Unionist%20Party"&gt;Democratic Unionist Party&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIan%20Paisley"&gt;Ian Paisley&lt;/a&gt;, 81, has announced he is resigning the positions of First Minister and DUP leader after what some believe is internal pressure from within the party. He originally announced he would govern for his full term till 2011.

Paisley plans to step down after an investment conference in May organized by the power-sharing &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Ireland%20Executive"&gt;Northern Ireland Executive&lt;/a&gt;.

Paisley told reporters, "I could go on and on but I've decided to go, I came to this decision a few weeks ago when I was thinking very much about the conference and what was going to come after the conference, I thought that it is a marker, a very big marker, and it would be a very appropriate time for me to bow out." Paisley noted he is not fully retiring as he will remain on the back benches at Stormont, the location of the &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Ireland%20Assembly"&gt;Northern Ireland Assembly&lt;/a&gt;.

Paisley has been a controversial, divisive figure in Northern Ireland politics throughout his five decades of involvement. Until his acceptance of the First Minister position with political rival and enemy and &lt;a href="w%3ASinn%20Fein"&gt;Sinn Fein&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20McGuinness"&gt;Martin McGuinness&lt;/a&gt;, a former IRA commander, Paisley was nicknamed Dr. No for his refusal to grant any concessions to the Irish nationalists or republicans and his working with McGuinness would have been unheard of ten years ago.
His announcement is believed to be in part because of this relationship with McGuinness, the two political rivals were photographed together enjoying a laugh, earning them the nickname, the "Chuckle Brothers." 

Hard-line factions within the DUP are not happy with Paisley sharing power with Sinn Fein, which they see as inextricably linked to the &lt;a href="w%3AProvisional%20Irish%20Republican%20Army"&gt;Provisional Irish Republican Army&lt;/a&gt;. Paisley used to refer to the party in political discourse as "Sinn Fein/IRA."

Paisley is known for fundamentalist anti-Catholic views and stances and helped to form the &lt;a href="w%3AFree%20Presbyterian%20Church%20of%20Ulster"&gt;Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster&lt;/a&gt; in 1951 as part of a disagreement between a local church in Crossgar, County Down and the elders of the county church governance. Paisley was forced to retire in January due to his political role as First Minister and possibly, his power-sharing with Sinn Fein.

The announcement comes one month before the tenth anniversary of Good Friday Agreement which ended the thirty year-long period of conflict know as the "&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Troubles"&gt;The Troubles&lt;/a&gt;" in which violence occurred between the nationalist and republican and the unionist and loyalist communities of Northern Ireland in the form of bombings, assassinations and gang violence.

It also comes a month after Ian Paisley's son, &lt;a href="w%3AIan%20Paisley%20Jr"&gt;Ian Paisley Jr&lt;/a&gt; resigned after accusations and criticism over links with property developer, Seymour Sweeney and controversy over lobbying. Paisley Junior noted today that he was transferring of the ownership of the firm which runs his constituency office in Ballymena to a representative of a north Antrim DUP branch.

&lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Robinson"&gt;Peter Robinson&lt;/a&gt;, the deputy leader and Northern Ireland Finance Minister is the likely choice to succeed Paisley, but some sources with in the party would not discount Northern Ireland Finance Minister &lt;a href="w%3ANigel%20Dodds"&gt;Nigel Dodds&lt;/a&gt; either.

Paisley's reaction to choosing his succesor was, "This is not the Church of Rome. This is not Apostolic succession and I have no right to say who will succeed me."

<h2>Reaction</h2>
&lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom"&gt;British Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Gordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt; noted, "Ian Paisley has made a huge contribution to political life in &lt;a href="Northern%20Ireland"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. The whole country values and admires the manner in which he has led as First Minister."

"His commitment and dedication to public service deserve our gratitude. Progress on bringing a lasting peace to Northern Ireland would not have been possible without his immense courage and leadership."

Irish &lt;a href="w%3ATaoiseach"&gt;Taoiseach&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABertie%20Ahern"&gt;Bertie Ahern&lt;/a&gt; also gave his feelings on Paisley, "The announcement by Dr Ian Paisley that he will step down from the post of First Minister is a watershed in the history of Ireland. He is a giant figure in the history of these islands. In recent years, I have grown to know Dr. Paisley and have valued the practical and friendly working relationship that developed between us. I respect him as a man who worked tirelessly for the people he represents and who has sincerely done what he believed was right."

&lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt;, the former British Prime Minister who was instrumental in restarting devolution said, "Ian Paisley's contribution to peace, after all the years of division and difference was decisive and determinative. In short, in the final analysis, he made it happen. The man famous for saying 'no' will go down in history for saying 'yes'."

Martin McGuinness, the Deputy First Minister gave his reaction, "Ian Paisley has played a very powerful role in the course of the politics of the north of Ireland and the island of Ireland. The historic decision he took to go into government with Sinn Fein has changed the face of Irish politics forever. I think that he will be fondly remembered by the people of Ireland - north and south - for the very courageous leadership that he showed."

Peter Robinson, Paisley's deputy said of his leader, "When violent Republicans tried to destabilize and destroy our province and force us into a United Ireland, Dr. Paisley led the Unionist population in opposition to their objectives." 

Robinson further added, "The DUP and indeed Northern Ireland will forever be indebted to Dr. Paisley for his contribution. He is truly a Unionist colossus and he can be justifiably proud that today Unionist politics and Northern Ireland's position within the Union are stronger than at any point during his extraordinary career."
&lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Durkan"&gt;Mark Durkan&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the nationalist &lt;a href="w%3ASocial%20Democratic%20and%20Labour%20Party"&gt;Social Democratic and Labour Party&lt;/a&gt; noted, "While this is very significant political news, there is responsibility on all of us as politicians to make the most of the political processes here no matter who comes or goes. In particular, we have to make a success of the investment conference in May and not allow this story to distort or distract from this focus." 

&lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Ford"&gt;David Ford&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the &lt;a href="w%3AAlliance%20Party%20of%20Northern%20Ireland"&gt;Alliance Party of Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt; also noted, "History will judge whether Ian Paisley will be remembered for 40 years of saying no or one year of saying probably. Many will say his road to Damascus conversion came 35 years too late. The achievements of the executive since last May have been modest in the extreme."

&lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Hain"&gt;Peter Hain&lt;/a&gt;, the former &lt;a href="w%3ASecretary%20of%20State%20for%20Northern%20Ireland"&gt;Secretary of State for Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt; gave his response, "He played an absolutely historic role in ending the deadlock and establishing permanent devolved government and deserves enormous credit for the courage and vision he showed."

&lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Allister"&gt;Jim Allister&lt;/a&gt;, a former DUP member who resigned over the power-sharing agreement with Sinn Fein and formed his own party, the &lt;a href="w%3ATraditional%20Unionist%20Voice"&gt;Traditional Unionist Voice&lt;/a&gt;, gave his word, "It has been quite clear for some time that Ian Paisley was going to be hung out to dry by the DUP pragmatists. He had served his purpose. He had delivered what they had devised, but couldn't sell themselves - government with unrepentant terrorists."

Six people, including two children, were found dead in a &lt;a href="w%3AMemphis%2C%20Tennessee"&gt;Memphis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Tennessee"&gt;Tennessee&lt;/a&gt; home in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; on Monday. Three wounded children were also found at the scene, a 7-year-old boy, a 10-month-old girl and a 4-year-old whose gender was not reported, were sent to &lt;a href="w%3ALe%20Bonheur%20Children%27s%20Medical%20Center"&gt;Le Bonheur Children's Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;. Two were last reported in very critical condition, while the other was in serious condition.

All of the victims had either gunshot or stab wounds, or both, and were all found in the same room. Its unclear as to the day it happened, but a neighboor from across the street said he heard gunshots being fired at around 8:30 p.m. on Sunday night.

The killer is still at large. "This is a stain on our community, and we really need the community's help," said Lt. Joe Scott of the &lt;a href="w%3AMemphis%20Police%20Department"&gt;Memphis Police Department&lt;/a&gt; at a press conference today.

"I don't know the answer," Mayor &lt;a href="w%3AW.%20W.%20Herenton"&gt;Willie Herenton&lt;/a&gt; told local television. "I don't think anybody knows the answer. I don't think more police officers, more jails, more people marching in the streets, praying — I don't think all of those things are the answers."

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Pentagon"&gt;Pentagon&lt;/a&gt; submitted a report to Congress on Monday, detailing the &lt;a href="w%3AChina%20National%20Space%20Administration"&gt;Chinese Space Agency&lt;/a&gt;'s focus on developing means for "space warfare". 
The Pentagon claims that &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; has been "exploring" laser, microwave, particle beam and electromagnetic pulse weapons, and suggests that China has been "developing the ability to attack an adversary's space assets," and would be able to disable or destroy enemy satellites. Such an offensive could be used to "blind and deafen the enemy" prior to an attack, according to the study.

The Pentagon analysis was released the same day that Yang Baohua, head of the &lt;a href="w%3AChina%20Academy%20of%20Space%20Technology"&gt;Academy of Space Technology&lt;/a&gt;, announced that testing of a new &lt;a href="w%3AExtra-vehicular%20activity"&gt;EVA spacesuit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAirlock"&gt;airlock&lt;/a&gt; had been successfully completed. The two units are being developed for China's first intended &lt;a href="w%3Aspacewalk"&gt;spacewalk&lt;/a&gt; as part of &lt;a href="w%3AShenzhou%207"&gt;Shenzhou 7&lt;/a&gt;, one of ten Chinese spacecraft being launched this year.

The move has caused aerospace analyst &lt;a href="w%3AJeff%20Foust"&gt;Jeff Foust&lt;/a&gt; to declare that "a full-fledged space race" has been gearing up between China and the United States.

In September, &lt;a href="NASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; administrator &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20D.%20Griffin"&gt;Mike Griffin&lt;/a&gt; caused waves when he suggested that China is more likely to put the next man on the moon than the United States, suggesting that "Americans will not like it," but that nothing could be done about it.

<h1>British student falls to his death from 10th floor window</h1>

An unnamed male student has fallen to his death from a tenth floor window in &lt;a href="w%3AMiddlesbrough"&gt;Middlesbrough&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;.

The 24-year-old threw himself out of an open window in Middlesbrough Tower, the main building of the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Teesside"&gt;University of Teesside&lt;/a&gt;. The drop was 120 feet high. Police and ambulance were called to the scene at around 18:30. The police are currently trying to contact the student's family, who do not live locally. The police have said that they are not treating the death as suspicious. A post-mortem is to be carried out today.

The building was open at the time and therefore anyone could have walked in, although &lt;a href="w%3AClose%20Circuit%20Television"&gt;CCTV&lt;/a&gt; was in operation. Students and staff who were in Middlesbrough Tower at the time were forced to leave the building at around 19:30 and give contact details to the police on duty.

One woman, who left the building minutes after the incident said, "There were three security guards and I think a cleaner near the body. They were obviously the first on the scene - and one of the security guards had already called an ambulance."

A spokesman for the university, which caters for 9,700 students, said, "We can confirm we are assisting the police following the tragic incident at the university campus last night. We will give more information as soon as we are able."

"At this time there are no suspicious circumstances and the coroner has been informed," said a police spokesperson. "The male is confirmed to be a student at the university and attempts are being made to contact relatives and for the male to be formally identified."

The global protests started in &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; where several hundred protesters gathered at different locations for peaceful protests.

In a global speech, the Internet protest movement said Scientology "betrayed the trust of its members, [had] taken their money, their rights, and at times their very lives." The protesters welcomed the public interest their protests have led to, and claimed they witnessed "an unprecedented flood of Scientologists [joining] us across the world to testify about these abuses." The group said it would continue with monthly actions.

In a press statement from its &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;an headquarters, Scientology accused the anonymous protesters of "hate speech and hate crimes", alleging that security measures were necessary because of death threats and bomb threats. This also makes the Church want to "identify members" of the group it brands as "cyber-terrorists".

♡❤Wikinews♡❤ had correspondents in a number of protest locations to report on the events.

Anonymous states that the next protest is scheduled to take place on April 18, which happens to be the birthday of Suri, the daughter of Tom and Katie Cruise.

♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANews.com.au"&gt;News.com.au&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ reported that approximately 200 masked protesters gathered outside of the Church of Scientology's headquarters in Adelaide. An anonymous spokesman told ♡❤News.com.au♡❤ that their group feels Scientology should not have tax-exempt status, and should not be considered a religion. At one point six police officers came by the protest; four members of a security firm stood outside the Scientology building throughout the protest.

In Atlanta, police arrested two protesters for, supposedly, using a bullhorn without a permit although reports confirm that there is no law or ordinance in Atlanta necessitating one. The police were under the impression that they were arresting the leaders of the protesters. The anonymous protesters reacted by shouting that they have no leader, but they made no attempts to free those arrested. The police also pulled over cars for honking at the protesters, causing them to make signs "Do not honk".

<h3>&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustin%2C%20Texas"&gt;Austin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;</h3>
Almost 135 protesters protested outside of the Church of Scientology location in Austin, Texas. Protesters received a permit to protest from 11AM to 4PM and stayed the full time allowed. Law enforcement officers were stationed outside the doors of the Church. These officers were very kind and open to conversation with Anonymous members. Protesters gathered across the street from the building as well as directly in front of it, waving signs and chanting. A UHaul van was converted to a Party Van which was eventually parked directly in front of the Church building for most of the day. Reports of Scientologists calling the UHaul company office, illegally claiming to be police officers, reached protesters soon after the van was parked. The protesters responded with a loud speaker saying "Impersonating a police officer is illegal, even on the phone!"

Around 2:30PM a young man arrived in front of the Church to counter the Anonymous group with a yellow sign reading "Freedom of [Religion]" on one side, and "It's Their Choice" on the other. He began by calling out "It's their Choice" to which the protesters across the street replied "We Agree" and then "Right to join, Right to leave!" Some Anonymous members swarmed over to confront the man, but were restrained to one-on-one talks with him by another Anonymous member. He later left the area after talks with the protesters.

BBC News drove by taking video of the protesters, but did not stop for interviews.

Over 250 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAnonymous%20%28group%29"&gt;Anonymous&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; protesters were out in force once more on the corners, at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABoston"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's &lt;a href="Scientology"&gt;Scientology&lt;/a&gt; church at the corners of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABeacon%20Street"&gt;Beacon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and Hereford Streets. Protesters only took up three corners, instead all four like they did on February 10th as police asked them politely to leave the street in front of Church vacant. Even though the protesters had a permit for all streets, they complied.

Wikinews talked to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABoston%20Police"&gt;Boston Police&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and was denied a video statement by one officer telling the reporter, "Get out of here," and brushing him off. However, the reporter asked another officer if there had been any trouble. The officer responded that there had been "no trouble, just people walking back and forth." Most the protest consisted of protesters handing out information pamphlets, DVDs, viral marketing cards for their campaign, talking to pedestrians who were passing by, shouting &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20meme"&gt;Internet memes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to one another and shouting various chants.

Some Anonymous put forward concerns about Scientology plants in the crowd trying to incite disruption, however, none was noted. Other protesters mentioned there were rumors that the Scientologists were going to bus in Scientology students to disrupt the protester, however, that did not occur. 

Scientologists were outside taking photos of the protesters, unlike February 10th, where they remained inside and photographing from the building. The Wikinews reporter asked a Scientologist why he taking pictures, he took the reporter's photograph and noted that he "was just taking pictures." Wikinews asked a church member if he would like to give a statement to Wikinews on camera, they denied the request and told the reporter they would send a statement via email to him. However, Wikinews has not yet received a statement from the Boston church.

<h3>&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABrussels"&gt;Brussels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Belgium"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;</h3>

Starting off from a meeting point at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABrussels-Central%20railway%20station"&gt;Brussels Central Station&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the anonymous protesters proceeded on foot to arrive at their licensed protest point outside the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABrussels%20Stock%20Exchange"&gt;Brussels Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; around 12:30 local time. The turnout was about half that of the previous protest with only 20 or so people present.

Per advice from the police, cake was not on offer. It had been pointed out that this would likely get the protesters overrun by children and vagrants. Unlike other countries, Belgium has laws prohibiting protesters to cover their faces, leaving the protesters to wear sunglasses and shawls.

The protest could not take place in front of Scientology's headquarters because an &lt;a href="E.U."&gt;E.U.&lt;/a&gt; summit was scheduled to continue until today. Scientology members were allowed to be active outside their headquarters, for their "open door day". No special activities inside their building was observed, just volunteers handing out flyers to perhaps a dozen passers-by. The press release for this open door day was devoted to Anonymous: 

The Scientologists said the event was inspired by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUniversal%20Declaration%20of%20Human%20Rights"&gt;Universal Declaration of Human Rights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which is however remembered on December 10 (also mentioned on the flags outside their office, see photo). The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Human%20Rights%20Council"&gt;United Nations Human Rights Council&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was established on March 15 (2006), a date closer to this weekend.

♡❤Wikinews♡❤ spoke to a Scientology representative in the European headquarters, which are located in the political heart of Brussels; ♡❤Law Street♡❤, just next to the Belgian and European parliament. Since Scientology was devoting the afternoon to human rights, we asked for Scientology's opinion about human rights controversies in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; (such as the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20Bay%20detention%20camp"&gt;Guantanamo Bay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; detainees). The representative told ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ that the Church is a religious movement and avoids taking general political stances.

The representative was also confident about the outcome of a pending lawsuit from the Belgian federal prosecutor. After an eight-year investigation, the Belgian justice said that the local and European chapters, as well as, members would be accused of blackmailing, swindling members, breaking trade and privacy laws, unlawfully practising medicine, and forming a criminal organisation.

"The file is empty," said the Scientology representative, who asserted that the inquiry had been so lengthy because the state could not prove any wrongdoings by the Church. He said that unlike in the US, Scientology is not seeking official recognition in Belgium, which recognises only six religions. He also claimed that there were more than 1,000 Scientologists in Belgium.

Anonymous distributed flyers and informed passers-by about Scientology. In a speech, they called for a dialogue with Scientology members, and said they were concerned for the parishioners' well-being:
♡❤Operation: Party Hard - expect us, with cake♡❤ was closed off with a birthday cake for the protesters.

Belgian media were in attendance with a film crew from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARTBF"&gt;RTBF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; interviewing several of the protesters and capturing their banners on tape. The slogans were mostly in English, ranging from "♡❤Religion is free, Scientology isn't♡❤" to "♡❤One billion years of servitude = super powers♡❤" — the latter a reference to the contracts that Scientologists sign when they become involved with the church's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASea%20Org"&gt;Sea Org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The police presence was low-key with only one senior officer and a member of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABelgian%20State%20Security%20Service"&gt;Belgian intelligence services&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; who took photographs.

Once more, protests took place outside of both the Queen Victoria Scientology Headquarters and the Tottenham Court Road Dianetics centre. The additional time available for protesters in the aftermath of a rushed February 10th protest allowed the many of Anonymous to expand their protest to include even more outreach towards members of the public, with Anonymous members handing out free cake, sweets and other confectionery along with leaflets and stickers to passers-by.

Signage was loud and varied, proclaiming a variety of messages to the public and Scientologists. Many of the signs declared amusing yet pointed comments, with others making more serious jabs at the Church of Scientology.

Despite a larger police presence at the Tottenham Court Road protest, the protesters and Scientologists were both peaceful. Police officers, when asked if they had had any problems with the protesters, replied, somewhat jovially, "I can't really speak to you, the only thing I can say is 'No comment'. No problems. I mean no comment."

<h3>&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AManchester"&gt;Manchester&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;</h3>
The protest started at approximately 11:00 local time with protesters saying that over 100 people have turned up to protest for at least part of the protest. It started at Deansgate, which is the same location as the one for the start of the February 10 protests. Members of Anonymous have told ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ that their members started arriving at 09:00 local time.

Protesters were holding placards with statements such as “Freedom of religion - A right / Freedom to oppress - A crime.” Placards asking “How do I anger seasoned Amnesty International prize winning journalist, John Sweeney?” were also held as part of the protest. John Sweeney was heavily featured in the UK press after he produced a documentary in which he claimed representatives of the Church of Scientology were constantly following him.

As with the other protests, protesters brought cake, as a result of it being close to the birthday of L. Ron Hubbard, founder of Scientology. 

One of the protesters told ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ that “The so-called Church of Scientology's multiple violations of the U.N.'s Universal Declaration on Human Rights have gone unnoticed and unchallenged for far too long.” He continued saying that “the corporation needs to learn that suppression of free speech, institution of forced labour and the more general suppression of its parishioners is both legally and morally wrong. The protests will continue until such a time that major changes are made to the Scientology's organizational structure, or until they meet accusations of wrongdoing head-on and provide evidence that the community's worries are unfounded.” He added that he was “not protesting against the religion of Scientology, but the corporation that delivers it.” &lt;/br&gt;

</ul>
Throughout the day, nearly 100 protesters including ex-Sea Org Scientology member Chuck Beatty, turned out in Buffalo with signs and enthusiasm. It was a cold and foggy day with temperatures in the low 30's (F) which is significantly warmer than the previous February 10 protests that drew only about 50 people. People filled Main Street across from the Church in a line which extended an entire city block. A radio was on hand playing 'Rick Roll' and also the audio recording of the Scientology interview with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Cruise"&gt;Tom Cruise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The day started off with an off duty Buffalo Police detective instructing the crowd to protest peacefully. The detective, who was identified to &lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt; only as 'Detective Tim' then immediately told protesters to remove masks that could be considered threatening. Scarves were allowed as it was a cold day, but bandannas were not permitted to be worn.

♡❤Wikinews♡❤ was earlier accused of being "fake" and Detective 'Tim' refused to give a statement to Wikinews saying "no media. You made that (press badge) from the Internet. I never seen this site before." 'Tim' then refused outright to give his last name and badge number. 'Tim' was quoted only during his time speaking publicly to the protesters.

Shortly after instructing people to remove masks, 'Tim' then accused a member of Anonymous of "portraying an &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AArab"&gt;Arabic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; terrorist" because of a scarf he was wearing and asked him to remove it.

Shortly after, at least three protesters were detained by police and questioned after taking photographs and video of the Church from across the street. Police approached the three and began to "yell" at them. 'Tim' then told one protester that "the Church want you arrested. Now how am I going to avoid that." The protester then willingly handed over his videotape of the church and asked not to be arrested. Subsequently all three were released without being charged. According to Detective 'Tim', "the tape is now the property of the police." The protesters were not on Church property and were only filming the areas of the Church visible from across the streets.

During the protest, a member of Anonymous read a speech, which according to him, was a worldwide speech to all Churches.

"Today - The Ides of March - is the day Julius Caesar was betrayed by those he trusted. Today we gather together as Anonymous to call attention to another betrayal of trust - that of the Church of Scientology upon its followers. Since is inception, Scientology has traded in false hopes and promises, betrayed the trust of its members, taken their money, their rights, and at times their very lives," said the statement.

"Last month 10,000 people demonstrated in one hundred and seven cities across the world. They came together to make the first breach in the wall of silence," added the statement.

Despite the incident, 'Tim' was friendly to the protesters, even stating that "he might be back later to have a few cupcakes."

According to a member of Anonymous, "we will come again, our numbers ever increasing, in April, May, June and July."

<h3>&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASeattle"&gt;Seattle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Washington"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;</h3>

The Seattle protest was divided into two halves. One group was to assemble at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWestlake%20Center"&gt;Westlake Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and would march from there to the Scientology site. The other group was to meet at the Seattle Center, closer to the site, disseminating fliers to the crowd.

Protesters began to gather in front of Westlake Center at about 9:30 PDT. with about a dozen protesters at first. One of the protesters revealed to me that he was a 30 year former member of the Church of Scientology from the Los Angeles area. He asserted that "this protest is just." He spoke of former members who have been afraid to come out, because of the continuously reinforced teachings of the church. Members are cautioned against looking onto the Internet for alternate information, that they could die if they were to even look at the Internet. The mind is trained not to seek out any information that could contradict the church's teachings. He said that if the Scientologists ever knew what really happens in the church management, they would be terrified, and turn away in droves.

Other members carried picket signs and leaflets. Early on, many of the crowd members were chatting with each other, sometimes taking pictures of each other. Passers by gave the assembled crowd mixed reactions to being approached. One of the members of the public expressed concern that a protest in Seattle would not do much, "They oughta be picketing Tom Cruise's house." 

Curiously, a few members actually took pictures of me standing off to the side with my camera. A few accused me of being from the church, attempting to gain identifiable information, and were therefore cautious. Others saw me as the only person around without a mask, and in this crowd I was the outsider.

At about 11:00 PDT, the crowd started to proceed north, up 5th Avenue in downtown Seattle. At no point did I witness any of the Anonymous group committing a crime. I however, could probably have been cited on multiple counts for jaywalking, in attempts to get a decently framed shot from my digital camera without being seen as marching with the crowd. Numerous car horns blared during the crowd's exodus down 5th Avenue. As the street took a turn north, the crowd passed Fischer Plaza, home to local ABC affiliate KOMO-TV. I noted that I had not seen any mainstream media coverage of the event. The march turned down Broad Street, and at this point I gave up trying to keep pace in front of the crowd. I pulled over to the side of the sidewalk, next to a chain link fence to get the last photos of this phase of the protest. Afterwards, I followed the procession as it turned onto Aurora, and reached the Scientology center.

The center itself is situated on one end of an overpass, Aurora Avenue crosses over Mercer Street here, and eastbound traffic on Mercer was treated to a large banner proclaiming "HONK AGAINST SCIENTOLOGY" The banner generated a considerable number of car horns, which resulted in an equal number of cheers from the crowd. On the north side of the center, more protesters positioned themselves around the parking lot. Very few members were visible, for a long time there was only one standing near the entrance back in a fenced off area. Members of the crowd would level jeers at the man, such as "What are your crimes?" Eventually two police officers arrived, who stationed themselves in the parking lot, observing the crowd and calmly turning back any protester who crossed into the parking lot with a warning. No Scientology personnel approached the crowd, or a member of the press.

The protest in Sydney gathered approximately 300 activists. The masked protesters gathered in Hyde Park and moved through the city to the Church of Scientology. Two large trucks obstructed the view of the Scientology office from across the street.

The protesting began at 10:30, and was quieter than the 10 February event, with about 100 protesters. Initially, all of the protesters were on the side of the street opposing the church, but later someone suggested loudly to cross over and soon both sides of the street had protesters, many right in front of the church. The protesters walked through the middle of the road, contrary to guidelines stated for the 10 February protest. This resulted in some booing from the protesters that didn't cross.

Police showed up at one point, and asked a few protesters (walking right through them) to clear a driveway.

&lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; has confirmed that the newest generation of &lt;a href="w%3ALong%20March%20rocket"&gt;Long March rockets&lt;/a&gt; has been re-scheduled to enter use in 2014. 

Liang Xiaohong, Vice President of China's &lt;a href="w%3AChina%20Academy%20of%20Launch%20Vehicle%20Technology"&gt;Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology&lt;/a&gt;, also confirmed that the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALong%20March%205%20rocket%20family"&gt;Changzheng 5&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ design was built around pollution-free technologies. 

The rocket has been under development since 2002, and was initially said to require only six years' research. However the new design, which will allow more than twice the payload of previous models, has seen a number of delays in funding and development.

Due to the large size of the new rockets, a new 200-hectare launch centre has been under construction at the existing &lt;a href="w%3AWenchang%20Satellite%20Launch%20Center"&gt;Wenchang Satellite Launch Center&lt;/a&gt; since September.

Until then, China is relying on its older fleet of rockets to carry on &lt;a href="w%3AChinese%20space%20program"&gt;its space program&lt;/a&gt;, consisting of more than ten launches scheduled for this year. This month a &lt;a href="w%3ALong%20March%203A"&gt;CA-3a&lt;/a&gt; rocket will take a &lt;a href="w%3ABeidou%20navigation%20system"&gt;Beidou navigation system&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href="w%3AMedium%20Earth%20Orbit"&gt;Medium Earth Orbit&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; federal officials flushed billion of gallons of water into the &lt;a href="w%3AGrand%20Canyon"&gt;Grand Canyon&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday, in an experimental effort to distribute sediment throughout the river and restore the ecosystem to a more natural state. 

The water was released from two pipes in the &lt;a href="w%3AGlen%20Canyon%20Dam"&gt;Glen Canyon Dam&lt;/a&gt;, which blocks the &lt;a href="w%3AColorado%20River"&gt;Colorado River&lt;/a&gt; and creates the artificial reservoir &lt;a href="w%3ALake%20Powell"&gt;Lake Powell&lt;/a&gt;. At a rate of more than 300,000 gallons of water per second, the flood could fill up the 102-story &lt;a href="w%3AEmpire%20State%20Building"&gt;Empire State Building&lt;/a&gt; in 20 minutes, said Interior Secretary &lt;a href="w%3ADirk%20Kempthorne"&gt;Dirk Kempthorne&lt;/a&gt;.

"This gives you a glimpse of what nature has been doing for millions of years, cutting through and creating this magnificent canyon," Kempthorne said after pulling the lever that released the water. The flood will continue for 60 hours, during which time the flow of water from the dam is expected to increase by four or five times.

After the dam was built in 1963, the seasonal floods that would spread sediment throughout the river were halted. This sediment was necessary for creating sandbars and beaches, which served as wildlife habitats. As a result, two fish species have become extinct, and two others have become endangered, including the &lt;a href="w%3Ahumpback%20chub"&gt;humpback chub&lt;/a&gt;. Although the water level will only rise a few feet after the flood, officials are hoping it will be enough to restore eroded sandbars downstream. 

Scientists will be conducting studies on how the flooding affects the native species and their habitats. "Our ultimate purpose is to learn whether or not this is a viable strategy for creating sandbars and habitats for native fish," said John Hamill, chief of the Grand Canyon Monitoring and Research Center.
Similar experiments were conducted in 1996 and 2004, although Randall Peterson, an environmental manager for the Bureau of Reclamation, says, "Those conditions were markedly different." He says that tributaries below the dam have released high volumes of sediment in recent years, making conditions more favorable.

However, environmentalists from the &lt;a href="w%3AGrand%20Canyon%20Trust"&gt;Grand Canyon Trust&lt;/a&gt;, which has often criticized the government's management of the dam, say there is more that can be done. They assert that the floods must occur regularly if any real change is to be expected, and they accuse the government of conducting the experiment for show. "They're trying to make it appear that they're doing something beneficial when they're just doing it for appearances," said Nikolai Lash, senior program director for the Trust. "It's being manipulated to be a 'one and done,' even though we know that doesn't work."

Grand Canyon National Park superintendent Steve Martin also raised concerns about the project. He said that not following up with more floods soon could actually destroy habitats rather than restoring them. Though the federal plan calls for smaller annual flows in autumn, Martin says these were timed to serve the interests of hydroelectric power producers. 

"The best time to get the most money for your hydropower is during peak energy demands, which is generally daytime hours and generally in the summer," Martin said. The U.S. Geological Survey acknowledged that the timing was partly designed in order to maximize electricity production during peak demand.

Meanwhile, others are simply unhappy with the arguing and indecision that have plagued the issue. Martha Hahn, science center director at the national park, said, "At some point we're going to have to draw a line in the sand and say this is the best way to manage the dam and manage resources in the Grand Canyon. We can't continue to go on and on just researching. We have to make a decision. We really are losing valuable resources."

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; Senator &lt;a href="John%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt;, the leading &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; candidate for the &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;US Presidency&lt;/a&gt;, secured the endorsement of the &lt;a href="wikt%3Aincumbent"&gt;incumbent&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday.

The &lt;a href="Arizona"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt; Senator travelled from &lt;a href="w%3ADallas%2C%20Texas"&gt;Dallas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; to have lunch with the President at the &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;.

Afterwards, the two stood before the press in the &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House%20Rose%20Garden"&gt;Rose Garden&lt;/a&gt;, where McCain received his formal endorsement from Bush.

"It's been my honor to welcome my friend, John McCain, as the nominee of the Republican Party," said Bush. "A while back I don't think many people would have thought that John McCain would be here as the nominee of the Republican Party—except he knew he would be here, and so did his wife, Cindy."

"It's a man who cares a lot about the less fortunate among us. He's a President, and he's going to be the President who will bring determination to defeat an enemy, and a heart big enough to love those who hurt," continued Bush.

"I’m very honored and humbled to have the opportunity to receive the endorsement of the President of the United States, a man who I have great admiration, respect and affection [for]," said McCain.
Joking about his low &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Presidential%20approval%20rating"&gt;approval ratings&lt;/a&gt;, President Bush also offered to oppose McCain, if he so preferred. "Either way, I want him to win," he said.

Speaking about the upcoming campaign, McCain told reporters, "I do intend to campaign all —across the country. I think that literally every section in this country is at—in play. And I will be glad to have the President with me, in keeping with his schedule, in any part of America. And we're going to go everywhere in America with this campaign."

&lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Duncan"&gt;Mike Duncan&lt;/a&gt;, the chairman of the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20National%20Committee"&gt;Republican National Committee&lt;/a&gt;, said the party is there to help McCain. "We’ve been preparing for the last several months," Duncan said. "We've been putting the staff together.♡❤ ♡❤And all of that is available to Senator McCain, as our the presumptive nominee, as of today."

&lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House%20Press%20Secretary"&gt;White House Press Secretary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADana%20Perino"&gt;Dana Perino&lt;/a&gt; said Bush would help raise money for the campaign as well as working toward securing Republican majorities in the House and Senate. "Across the board, Republicans are going to support President Bush and Senator McCain," she said.

According to ♡❤The New York Times♡❤, McCain's top advisers are eager to enlist the president for his fund-raising prowess. However, they do not want McCain to appear too often at the side of President Bush. They say their reluctance has nothing to do with the President’s unpopularity and is not a sign of running away from the President. Rather, McCain needs to be seen on his own, or "stand in the sun" as one adviser put it.

John McCain became the presumptive Republican nominee after Tuesday's primaries.

The following deaths were reported yesterday:

<h3>&lt;a href="w%3ADerek%20Dooley"&gt;Derek Dooley&lt;/a&gt;</h3>

Derek Dooley, who worked for both Sheffield United and Sheffield Wednesday football clubs, died yesterday at the age of 78. In 2003 Dooley was awarded an MBE for his services to football.

Derek McCabe said that "Derek [Dooley] was a special guy. He united the city in football. He never forgot the value of grassroots football so we feel this is an appropriate and fitting tribute to a man who was passionate about the game and loved the city, the Blades and the Owls."

Police and the military are currently investigating a "small explosion" in &lt;a href="w%3ATimes%20Square"&gt;Times Square&lt;/a&gt;, in midtown &lt;a href="New%20York%2C%20New%20York"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;. The investigation focuses around reports of a hole in the window of a military recruitment office in the center of the Square.

Reports suggest that the device was a "small bomb or incendiary device", however there were no reports of any injuries. Windows in the office were blown out and witnesses say the building shook from the blast.

Subway trains were earlier prevented from entering the area, while military units and fire officials investigated the incident. There are currently no suspects in the incident and no arrests have been made.

<h1>Apple releases iPhone SDK, announces upcoming update</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Apple%20releases%20iPhone%20SDK%2C%20announces%20upcoming%20update&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

During a media event held at its &lt;a href="w%3ACupertino"&gt;Cupertino&lt;/a&gt; headquarters, &lt;a href="w%3AApple"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; released the long awaited &lt;a href="w%3AiPhone"&gt;iPhones&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASoftware%20Development%20Kit"&gt;Software Development Kit&lt;/a&gt; (SDK) and the associated &lt;a href="w%3AiTunes"&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt; "App Store" and iPhone Developer Program. The SDK will allow third party software developers to create applications for the iPhone and then distribute them on the iTunes Apps Stores. Any members of the iPhone Developer Program can add applications to the store for free; the program costs $99 (&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Dollar"&gt;USD&lt;/a&gt;) to join. Developers will be able to set the price of the applications or release them for free. All applications will have to be approved by Apple before being allowed on the store. Some of the disallowed categories are"porn", excessive &lt;a href="w%3Abandwidth"&gt;bandwidth&lt;/a&gt; users and anything malicious or illegal. &lt;a href="w%3AVoIP"&gt;VoIP&lt;/a&gt; applications would be allowed over &lt;a href="w%3AWi-Fi"&gt;Wi-Fi&lt;/a&gt; only. Enterprises can setup private pages on the store to distribute internal applications. 

At the event several third party developers that had been given early access to the SDK demonstrated their applications. Among the applications demonstrated were &lt;a href="w%3AElectronic%20Arts"&gt;EA&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ASpore%20%28video%20game%29"&gt;Spore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAOL"&gt;AOL&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AAIM"&gt;AIM&lt;/a&gt; instant messenger and a client for &lt;a href="w%3Aepocrates"&gt;epocrates&lt;/a&gt;, a drug reference service. 

The company also announced the iPhone 2.0 update that was released as a closed beta for developers and is scheduled for public release in June. In the new version Apple has been focusing on enterprise features in an attempt to compete with rivals like &lt;a href="w%3ARIM"&gt;RIM&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ABlackBerry"&gt;BlackBerry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href="w%3AWindows%20Mobile"&gt;Windows Mobile&lt;/a&gt;. The update adds support for &lt;a href="w%3AActiveSync"&gt;ActiveSync&lt;/a&gt;, which Apple has licensed from rival Microsoft, &lt;a href="w%3AWPA2"&gt;WPA2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Avirtual%20private%20network"&gt;virtual private network support&lt;/a&gt;. The update will also be available to iPod Touch users for what Steve Jobs described as “a nominal charge”, as Apple have done in the past with the previous &lt;a href="w%3AiPod%20Touch"&gt;iPod Touch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMacBook"&gt;MacBook&lt;/a&gt; Wi-Fi updates.

<h1>Gunman kills eight at Jerusalem school</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Gunman%20kills%20eight%20at%20Jerusalem%20school&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

On Thursday night, a &lt;a href="Palestine"&gt;Palestinian&lt;/a&gt; gunman entered the library at the &lt;a href="w%3AMercaz%20HaRav"&gt;Mercaz HaRav&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="w%3AHardal"&gt;orthodox&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Ayeshiva"&gt;religious seminary&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href="w%3AJerusalem"&gt;Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;. He opened fire with an automatic weapon, killing eight people and wounding another ten.

This is the most lethal attack on Israeli civilians in two years and the first attack in Jerusalem in more than three years.

"A terrorist infiltrated the Mercaz HaRav seminary and opened fire. He was killed in an exchange of fire and apparently had an explosives belt," said police spokesperson Shmuel Ben Ruby.

Police chief Aharon Franco said the attack was carried out by a lone gunman who "hid the weapon in a cardboard box." He said the gunman was subsequently killed by an Israeli army officer who, living nearby, ran to the school after hearing gunfire.

Seminary student Yitzhak Dadon, however, claims that he shot the gunman. "He came out of the library spraying automatic fire. ... The terrorist came to the entrance and I shot him twice in the head," Dadon told reporters.
"I saw the gunman and he fired a long burst in the air. But then he disappeared. I saw him again when he approached the door of the library. I shot him twice in the head. He started to sway and then someone else with a rifle fired at him, and he died," Dadon said.

&lt;a href="w%3AHamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt; sent a text message to reporters, stating, "We bless the (Jerusalem) operation. It will not be the last," but it did not claim responsibility. &lt;a href="w%3ASami%20Abu%20Zuhri"&gt;Sami Abu Zuhri&lt;/a&gt;, a senior spokesperson for Hamas, said the group "blesses the heroic operation in Jerusalem, which was a natural reaction to the Zionist massacre," referring to the recent &lt;a href="w%3AOperation%20Hot%20Winter"&gt;Israeli offensive&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AGaza%20Strip"&gt;Gaza Strip&lt;/a&gt; which killed at least 58 Palestinian civilians.

"It's very sad tonight in Jerusalem. Many people were killed in the heart of Jerusalem," said Jerusalem mayor &lt;a href="w%3AUri%20Lupolianski"&gt;Uri Lupolianski&lt;/a&gt;.

A spokesperson for the &lt;a href="w%3AForeign%20Affairs%20Minister%20of%20Israel"&gt;Foreign Affairs Minister of Israel&lt;/a&gt; said, "terrorists are trying to destroy the chances of peace but we will certainly continue peace talks."

&lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20Palestinian%20National%20Authority"&gt;President of the Palestinian National Authority&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Mahmoud%20Abbas"&gt;Mahmoud Abbas&lt;/a&gt;, who recently froze peace talks with Israel, condemned the attack in Jerusalem.

After playing 17 seasons in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;' top professional &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20football"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; league, quarterback &lt;a href="w%3ABrett%20Favre"&gt;Brett Favre&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Football%20League"&gt;National Football League&lt;/a&gt;'s (NFL) &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Bay%20Packers"&gt;Green Bay Packers&lt;/a&gt; bid a final farewell to the sport in an emotional press conference at &lt;a href="w%3ALambeau%20Field"&gt;Lambeau Field&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday, saying he is "not up to the challenge" of another season.

"I know I can play. But I don't think I want to, and that's what it really comes down to," the 38-year-old Favre said.

Favre, who officially retired on Tuesday, dressed for the hour-long event in an untucked button-down shirt, blue jeans, and days worth of stubble. "It is on my terms, which is a good way to go out," he said of his attire. He thanked the Green Bay Packers' organization, his family, and his fans for their support throughout his career, but reluctantly admitted it was time to move on. 

"I’ve given everything I can possibly give to this organization and I don’t think I’ve got anything left to give," he said, as tears welled up in his eyes. "What matters is it’s been a great career for me. It’s over. As hard as it is for me to say, it’s over."

His retirement came as somewhat of a surprise to the Packers, who expected he would return for another year. Favre refuted the notion that the Packers did not do enough to get him to return, and assured the organization that nothing they could have done would have affected his decision. 
"I know there's been comments and issues in the press lately about why I'm leaving, whether or not the Packers did enough, whether or not Ted or (coach) Mike (McCarthy) convinced me to stay," Favre said. "None of those things have anything to do with me retiring, and that's from the heart."

He instead offered a simpler reason for his departure: the stress of the job was getting to be too much "I don't think it would get easier next year or the following year," he said. "It hasn't up until this point. It's only gotten tougher and something told me 'You know it's gotten too hard for you.'"

When asked about his future plans, he replied, "Nothing." This is a new phase in his life, he explained. "I am going to stick to that until I want to do something else." He and his wife, Deanna, said they will be putting all public events on hold for a year, because, as Deanna said, "Honestly, we both are really tired." He says they will still be involved with charities in the future, but not as extensively as before.

Favre holds NFL records in most wins by a starting quarterback, most passing yards, most passing touchdowns and most consecutive games started. However, he says that "the statistics part wasn't that important. I was never really a statistics guy. I hope my legacy is a lot more than that."

In 2007, he led the Packers to a 13-3 season, but lost in the NFC championship game to the eventual champion &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Giants"&gt;New York Giants&lt;/a&gt;. The final pass of his career was an interception that resulted in the Giants' game-winning field goal. Still, Favre believes he is "going out on top", and he could "care less what other people think". 

"One play, one game, one season, doesn't define me," he said. "It has been a wonderful career."

Recently the professional filmmaker &lt;a href="w%3AVoluntary_association"&gt;association&lt;/a&gt; Loin de l'Œil started to produce a set of three documentaries (90~120mn) about &lt;a href="w%3Anonviolence"&gt;nonviolent&lt;/a&gt; movements in &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;. From the 70's, to the largest nonviolent struggle (after &lt;a href="w%3AMahatma_Gandhi"&gt;Gandhi&lt;/a&gt;'s one) that happened in October 2007, and called &lt;a href="w%3AJanadesh"&gt;Janadesh&lt;/a&gt;.

This content is dedicated to be liberated via a special website, experimenting for the first time the "funding and licensing" model to release under &lt;a href="w%3ACreative%20Commons"&gt;Creative Commons&lt;/a&gt; licenses:

The project name "then you win" comes from the famous quote:

The budget could be reduced about 30-40% by using exclusively &lt;a href="w%3Afree%20software"&gt;free software&lt;/a&gt;, collaborative work, and bypassing numerous middlemen. Audience is still low because of the project's youth but getting more and more interest from the &lt;a href="w%3AFree_Culture_movement"&gt;free culture&lt;/a&gt; community, the most significant support came from &lt;a href="w%3ALawrence%20Lessig"&gt;Lawrence Lessig&lt;/a&gt; who became the first online donor.

After the bombing of a military recruiting station in &lt;a href="New%20York%2C%20New%20York"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATimes%20Square"&gt;Times Square&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , police in &lt;a href="Washington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; are investigating letters addressed to "members of &lt;a href="United%20States%20Congress"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt;", which contain a picture of the recruiting station before the explosion and the message "Happy New Year, We Did It". 

The letters arrived at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACapitol%20Hill"&gt;Capitol Hill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Thursday in manila envelopes, according to an anonymous &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Democratic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; aide who is investigating the matter. The picture was accompanied by what seemed to be a 10 page manifesto against the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20War"&gt;Iraq War&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Also included was a booklet, which the aide says he cannot identify.

Another aide who is part of the investigation says similar letters arrived in up to ten offices. In an email sent by &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Senate"&gt;senator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADiane%20Feinstein"&gt;Diane Feinstein&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , recipients were urged to leave the letters alone and call police. 

A congressional staffer describes the person in the photo as a white man with red hair, apparently in his 30s.

In a statement, the Capitol Police said, "The U.S. Capitol Police and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are working together to investigate letters received by various members of Congress. There is no established connection between these letters and the New York City Times Square incident this morning. The investigation is ongoing...more details as they become available."

No one was injured in the explosion, which occurred around 3:40 a.m. Thursday. The small bomb caused only minor damage to the recruiting station, shattering a glass door and leaving a hole in a window.

♡❤Wikinews♡❤ held an exclusive interview with &lt;a href="w%3ACynthia%20McKinney"&gt;Cynthia McKinney&lt;/a&gt;, one of the candidates for the &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Party"&gt;Green Party&lt;/a&gt; nomination for the &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20U.S.%20presidential%20election"&gt;2008 U.S. presidential election&lt;/a&gt;.

McKinney is a former &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Democratic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACongresswoman"&gt;Congresswoman&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3AGeorgia"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;. She was first elected to the &lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; in 1992 and held her seat for ten years until being defeated by &lt;a href="w%3ADenise%20Majette"&gt;Denise Majette&lt;/a&gt; in 2002. She was the first ever &lt;a href="w%3AAfrican%20American"&gt;African American&lt;/a&gt; woman from her state to be elected to Congress.

We asked her why she made the recent switch to the &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Party"&gt;Green Party&lt;/a&gt;. She replied, "Due to the importance of environmental issues, Green issues are the issues of today. The Ten Key Values of
the Green Party stress us getting along with each other in harmony with the planet that gives us life."

When asked about how she would handle Iraq she replied, "I would instruct the Joint Chiefs to draw up a plan for the orderly withdrawal of all U.S. troops from the country. I would dismantle our military bases in the area, and I would also demand that U.S. and
other international corporations relinquish any claims to Iraqi oil or
other resources and withdraw as well."

McKinney is running for president because, basically, she thinks that "it's time that the people win".

<h2>Interview</h2>

♡❤♡Why are you running for president?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Congresswoman McKinney:♡❤♡ It is clear that the country needs an additional political party that is not beholden to special interests or corporate lobbyists. Just 5% of the electorate, voting for a third party candidate gets the nation just that. Therefore, for those who are tired of the ability of special interests and corporate interests to subvert the will of the people, their values, or change their policy makers,winning the 5% is the best way to infuse structural change into our political system.

A victory for the Green Party in this election is possible and necessary. The alternative we present will appeal to the large numbers of disfranchised voters who do not see the major party candidates addressing their issues. In order for a democratic government to work in the public interest, it has to be both transparent and accountable. If 5% vote Green, it will put a third chair at the table of American politics, and it will open the door to the people to see what is going on inside the two-party system that has become controlled by corporations and the expanding power of a military, industrial, and intelligence complex that President Eisenhower warned of in 1960. The Green Party will represent the voices of the majority of diverse and disfranchized voters and citizens and will directly and effectively address their issues.

I spent my birthday last year protesting in front of the Pentagon. At that rally, I stated that upon winning a majority of the seats in the Congress, the Democratic representatives should have repealed the Bush tax cuts, repealed the Patriot Act, the Secret Evidence Act, and the Military Tribunals Act. And that the majority in Congress should have voted a livable wage for America's workers. And that someone should be trying to locate the $2.3 trillion lost by the Pentagon to pay instead for jobs, health care, and education. I was saddened by the Democratic majority's failure to stop funding the war, and declared my own independence from a national leadership that gave us war crimes, torture, and crimes against humanity. Unfortunately, there is not a major party candidate in the race that has not voted to fund this war. And that vote to fund what is clearly an immoral and illegal war is a vote of complicity in the torture and war crimes that are being committed as part of this war.

The deep economic morass which is facing our country today is not being adequately addressed. We are witnessing, through the sub-prime mortgage crisis, the greatest wealth transfer in our history from Black and Latino households. Yet, while they are being asked to tighten their belts, the CEOs of the banks that caused this crisis are reaping maximum pay. Even the solutions proposed by the major candidates focus on using taxpayers' funds to reimburse the banks instead of funding alternative refinancing in the poorest communities. It is clear that in this scenario, the banks always win.

Well, I think it's time that the people win. Our children shouldn't have to graduate from college one hundred thousand dollars in debt. That is a policy choice made by public policy makers. We don't have to have 48 million Americans without access to health insurance, and even more who are under-insured. Our Congress doesn't have to authorize an increase in national borrowing to nearly $10 trillion shrouded in secrecy. This country should not have racial disparity gaps wider now than at the time of the murder of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. But these are the facts about conditions that Americans are forced to live through every day. Sadly, our policy makers would rather have our country spend $720 million a day on war. Just imagine what that amount could buy in a single payer health care system, education subsidies from Head Start to university, or green technology home conversions and sustainable, safe and non-polluting energy sources.

Politics can change things. I have seen that in my lifetime. But we must have policy makers committed to the kind of public policy that reflects our values and those policy makers must be more than marionettes whose strings are pulled by forces not seen or understood by the voters. Those are some of the compelling reasons why I chose to leave the Democratic Party after many years and to run for President on the Green Party ticket.

♡❤♡You were a Democrat until not too long ago. Why the switch to the Green Party?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Congresswoman McKinney:♡❤♡ The Green Party is an international party that makes policy in other countries in the world. Due to the importance of environmental issues, Green issues are the issues of today. The Ten Key Values of the Green Party stress us getting along with each other in harmony with the planet that gives us life. We need to get along with each other, and we need to respect our environment.

The Green Party also is not constrained in its policy positions by considerations of large corporate donors because the Green Party is supported by individuals who share its values, not large donors intent on gaining concessions at the expense of the people and the U.S. national interest.

♡❤♡If elected, how would you handle Iraq?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Congresswoman McKinney:♡❤♡ I would instruct the Joint Chiefs to draw up a plan for the orderly withdrawal of all U.S. troops from the country. I would dismantle our military bases in the area, and I would also demand that U.S. and other international corporations relinquish any claims to Iraqi oil or other resources and withdraw as well. I would encourage the Iraqi people to select their own leaders through the ballot box with assistance from the best minds in the universities region and in the world, in very much the same way that the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa was written. I would support the establishment of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to inaugurate a just peace and I would deploy a Peace Corps to the country that would work in concert with the reconstruction needs of the Iraqi people and their leadership.

I would go further than Iraq. I would deconstruct AFRICOM, the new continent-wide U.S. military command set up in Africa, to show the world that the United States has more to share with it than its military might, destabilizing covert operations, nukes, bombs, and missiles. I would work with the Congress to make sure that the face of U.S. engagement with the world is not a military one.

♡❤♡How would you handle abortion?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Congresswoman McKinney:♡❤♡ I would not change Roe v. Wade, I would protect and expand women's reproductive rights, and I would work with Congress to bolster family planning and protection against sexually transmitted diseases here and abroad. I would also support better sex education in our schools and community centers, as well as making safe and healthy preventive measures available through heath care providers and community programs to reduce unwanted pregnancies and the spread of HIV/AIDS. Many factors come into any woman's decision to get pregnant or have an abortion. We are still missing effective policies to insure safe, affordable and effective birth control for both genders, programs that support education and employment for single parents, courts that insure child support payments, and available health care through pregnancy and childbirth, and for children.

♡❤♡There are thousands reading this right now. What could you say to convince them to give you their vote?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Congresswoman McKinney:♡❤♡ People in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Haiti, India, Italy, Nicaragua, and Spain decided that even during their deepest national tragedies, they would vote their values, their dreams, and their aspirations. The governments that resulted were not just face-changes, but were governments reflective of the people's deep longing for real change. As a result, policies are being offered and implemented that reflect the truest values of the people--they want to enjoy peace and the right of self-determnination.

I believe in the good that our government can do to respect civil liberties, the dignity of work, restorative justice (not just incarceration for profit), and peace. I believe that whoever wins the general election right now, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABarack%20Obama"&gt;Barak Obama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤[sic]♡❤, Hillary Clinton or John McCain, the people will still need a third party with standing to keep them accountable. But to achieve these goals, 5% of us are going to have to do something we've never done before in order to have something we've never had before. I am taking a stand for justice and for peace. I hope others willing to step outside of the two-party paradigm will join me in an effort to make the structural change in the political system that our country so urgently needs.

&lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Watson"&gt;Paul Watson&lt;/a&gt; of the anti-whaling group &lt;a href="w%3ASea%20Shepherd"&gt;Sea Shepherd&lt;/a&gt; says that he was shot by &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt; sailors while protesting against their hunting practices in &lt;a href="Antarctica"&gt;Antarctica&lt;/a&gt;. Watson, captain of the Sea Shepherd ship the ♡❤Steve Irwin♡❤, stated that his crew had been throwing stink bombs at the sailors, but that they responded with gunfire and &lt;a href="w%3AFlash%20grenade"&gt;flash grenade&lt;/a&gt;s. 

Watson said he was hit in the chest and found a bullet in the &lt;a href="w%3ABallistic%20vest"&gt;ballistic vest&lt;/a&gt; he was wearing. Watson told &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n radio: "It bruised my shoulder but it would have hit my heart if I didn't have the vest". He says one of his crew members received minor injuries after being hit by a flash grenade. ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANews%20Limited"&gt;News Limited&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reported that Ralph Lowe, 33, had a bruised back from a flash grenade that exploded behind him, and that Ashley Dunn, 35, received a hip injury while trying to get away from an explosion. David Page, the ship's doctor, was filmed by the Sea Shepherd group prying a bullet from Watsons's Kevlar vest, and said "You have been hit by a bullet".

Tokyo denied Watson's account, stating that "warning devices" were thrown after their ship had been attacked. Japan's foreign ministry said that their coastguard on the ♡❤Nisshin Maru♡❤ threw a baseball-sized device which exploded near the protesters' ship and emitted a loud sound, and was not designed to cause harm to anyone. Glenn Inwood, spokesman for the Japanese whalers, told &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation"&gt;ABC Radio&lt;/a&gt;: "Any claim from Paul Watson that he was fired at with a gun and has a bullet lodged in his bulletproof vest is absolutely false." Inwood stated there had been "retaliation" when the Japanese coast guards fired warning balls at the ♡❤Steve Irwin♡❤.

Australian Foreign Minister &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Smith%20%28Australian%20politician%29"&gt;Stephen Smith&lt;/a&gt; released a statement regarding information he received from Japanese officials: "Japanese officials have now advised the Australian embassy in Tokyo that during the incident in the Southern Ocean this afternoon, three warning balls — also known as flashbangs — had been fired ... Japanese officials have advised that these devices are designed to make a loud noise but not to injure, and that no gunshots had been fired." Japan also told the Australian Embassy that one of the crew members of the ♡❤Nisshin Maru♡❤ had fired a warning shot in the air. Smith stated: "I absolutely condemn actions by crew members of any vessel that cause injury – or have the potential to cause injury — to anyone on the high seas ... The Australian Government once again calls on all parties in the Southern Ocean — including all protest and whaling vessels, and their respective crews – to exercise restraint."

Watson explained to Australia's &lt;a href="w%3AABC%20News%20%28Australia%29"&gt;ABC News&lt;/a&gt; that the Japanese whalers had no reason to fire on the protesters: "We were doing what we usually do, which is putting stink bombs on deck ... We go out of our way to make sure we don't throw them near anybody, but they were throwing the flash grenades directly at us." If Watson's statements are proven to be true, the actions of the Japanese saliors represents a breach of international law. 

Japan claimed that four crew members of the ♡❤Nisshin Maru♡❤ were injured in the confrontation, but Watson denied this. Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary &lt;a href="w%3ANobutaka%20Machimura"&gt;Nobutaka Machimura&lt;/a&gt; criticized the Sea Shepherd group in a statement to reporters: "They have repeatedly resorted to such activities and it is truly unforgivable ... Is it all right to hurt humans in order to protect whales? I think whales are cute and important creatures, but even so, hurting humans is unforgivable." 

Earlier this week, Sea Shepherd protesters clashed with the ♡❤Nisshin Maru♡❤, and threw stink bombs and "slippery" powder at the Japanese ship. Two Sea Shepherd protesters were taken hostage in January after they boarded a Japanese harpoon ship, the ♡❤Yushin Maru No. 2♡❤, and Australia later brokered their release. Protesters have been following the ♡❤Nisshin Maru♡❤ since Japan began its annual hunt for whales in the Southern Ocean in December. 

Both &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; and Australia have led international protests against the hunting of whales. Last month Australia released film of whale slaughter taken from its customs ship, the ♡❤Oceanic Viking♡❤, and said the footage could be used in a potential international legal challenge to Japan's whaling activities. Due to a loophole in a 1986 global moratorium on whaling that allows "lethal research" on whales, Japan kills up to 1,000 of the mammals per year.

&lt;a href="w%3AEve%20Carson"&gt;Eve Carson&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3Astudent%20body%20president"&gt;student body president&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20North%20Carolina%20at%20Chapel%20Hill"&gt;University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill&lt;/a&gt;, was found dead on a street about one mile from campus early Wednesday morning.

The Chapel Hill Police Department responded to a report of gunshots around 5 a.m. Wednesday morning, and found a young woman lying dead on the road. She had been shot several times, including a shot in the head. One of two 9-1-1 callers reported hearing a woman screaming.

She was quickly identified as Eve Marie Carson, the 22-year-old Student Body President at UNC. The &lt;a href="w%3AAthens%2C%20Georgia"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt; resident was last seen alive around 1:30 a.m. that morning

A medical examiner says there was no evidence of sexual assault. Police currently believe it was a random act of violence, and may have involved the theft of her SUV. Her SUV was found about a mile away, and her keys and wallet are missing.

Carson's death comes nearly a year after the death of Jason Ray, a male cheerleader who at the time performed as the school's mascot, Rameses. He was struck by a car in a hit-and-run in New Jersey on March 24, 2007, during the Regionals of the 2007 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament, and died two days later of his injuries. Two men were charged in his death on January 18 of this year.

Several memorials were held on Thursday for Carson, drawing over 10,000 people in total. The Student Government website is currently shut down in her memory. The website simply has a link for providing information on her murder and the following message: "We thank you for your concern and support during this time of great loss. We ask that you allow us time to grieve."

Carson was studying &lt;a href="w%3Apolitical%20science"&gt;political science&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Apre-medical"&gt;pre-medicine&lt;/a&gt;, and had studied abroad in &lt;a href="Cuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt; in spring 2006. She was part of the North Carolina Fellows Program, and had served from 2006 to 2007 in student government roles including Member of Academic Advising Committee and Representative to the University Committee on Awards, Scholarships and Student Aid.

In 1975, during International Women's Year, the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; gave official sanction to the day, and began sponsoring events.

A politician from &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;'s ruling &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APSOE"&gt;Socialist Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has been killed in Spain's northern &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABasque%20Country"&gt;Basque region&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , in the town of Mondragon. The shooting came just two days before general elections in Spain.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIsa%C3%ADas%20Carrasco"&gt;Isaías Carrasco&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , 42, was shot outside his house in front of his wife and daughter and was taken to hospital, where he died of his wounds. No group has claimed the attack but Spanish sources said the attack was probably carried out by the Basque &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aseparatism"&gt;separatist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; group, considered as a terrorist group by European Union and United States, &lt;a href="ETA"&gt;ETA&lt;/a&gt;.

Spain is in the final day of official campaigning ahead of Sunday's general election, in which the Socialist prime minister &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARodriguez%20Zapatero"&gt;Rodriguez Zapatero&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is seeking a second term. The conservative opposition &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APartido%20Popular"&gt;Partido Popular&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has focused his campaign in the terrorism and separatism, especially that of the Basque. After the shooting the main parties announced a halt to campaigning. According to the polls, the two parties are neck and neck in the race for the election.

<h1>2008 Tour de Taiwan, TaiSPO, and Taipei Cycle: 3-in-1 preview</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=2008%20Tour%20de%20Taiwan%2C%20TaiSPO%2C%20and%20Taipei%20Cycle%3A%203-in-1%20preview&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Prior to the main race of 2008 &lt;a href="w%3ATour%20de%20Taiwan"&gt;Tour de Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;, the 2008 Taipei Cycle (Taipei International Cycle Show, located at &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20World%20Trade%20Center%20Nangang%20Exhibition%20Hall"&gt;TWTC Nangang&lt;/a&gt;) and TaiSPO (Taipei International Sporting Goods show, located at &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20World%20Trade%20Center"&gt;Taipei World Trade Center&lt;/a&gt; Hall 1) will not only exhibit from next Tuesday to Sunday (March 13-16) but it will also bring multiple opportunities for sporting goods, athletic sports, bicycle, and MICE (meeting, incentive, convention, and exhibition) industries after the TWTC Nangang stage was firmly included into 2008 Tour de Taiwan and its race will be start next Saturday (March 15).

<h2>2008 Tour de Taiwan: Not only for 2008 Summer Olympics, but also for basic sport.</h2>

Without cross-division races in this tournament, and the TWTC Nangang will be launched with the starting of 2008 Taipei Cycle, this race will enroll 2 stages for Taipei City after the joining of TWTC Nangang Stage.

Besides of the international competition, if the 3rd Taipei Citizen Elimination Road Race could expand its scale on local racing clubs' participation, this special event will be a best creation for promoting basic bicycle sports in Taiwan.

On the other hand, this international race, &lt;a href="w%3AUCI%20race%20classifications"&gt;classified&lt;/a&gt; as 2.2 class race by &lt;a href="w%3AUnion%20Cycliste%20Internationale"&gt;UCI&lt;/a&gt;, will determine the qualifications of &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20Summer%20Olympics"&gt;2008 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt; especially long-distance road races at &lt;a href="w%3APingtung%20County"&gt;Pingtung County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AChanghua%20County"&gt;Changhua County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHsinchu%20City"&gt;Hsinchu City&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20County"&gt;Taipei County&lt;/a&gt; stages.

<h2>Taipei Cycle &amp; TaiSPO: A reunion with convergence effects for bicycle &amp; sporting good industries</h2>

Since the Taipei Cycle was independent from TaiSPO in 1988, the TaiSPO and Taipei Cycle showcased significant differences from different industrial nature.

Originally, Taiwan was notable in the export market and was stable in the bicycle industry since its industry was decayed in &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, several OBMs like Merida and &lt;a href="w%3AGiant%20Manufacturing"&gt;Giant&lt;/a&gt; were on the rise, and the bicycle industry was transformed from OEM to OBM with high extra values and "Taiwan Bicycle Three 'New' Movements: New materials, New functions, and New purposes", proposed by Giant in 2001.

On the other hand of TaiSPO, with several past incidents on exhibition hall moving, operational rights between organizations and associations, and construction of TWTC, this sporting good show witnessed some histories as what &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan%20External%20Trade%20Development%20Council"&gt;TAITRA&lt;/a&gt; underwent and became a senior and a key trade show in Asia with technology inventions, creative conceptions, market transformations.

Though the fitness and leisure industries were improving with various changes for the modern lifestyles in the sporting goods industry, after the reunion of TaiSPO and Taipei Cycle, those two shows will bring opportunities and convergences for bicycle, sporting goods, and leisure sport industries.

<h2>TWTC Nangang: A key show venue with multiple opportunities</h2>
Since the TWTC Nangang, twice larger than the current TWTC and its upper hall has a feature with column-free, &lt;a href="TWTC%20Nangang%20is%20constructed%20in%20Taipei%2C%20Taiwan"&gt;was constructed last November&lt;/a&gt;, several companies from varied industries including MICE focused on this venue.

To evaluate some conditions on &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20Trade%20Shows"&gt;international trade shows&lt;/a&gt;, the Taipei Cycle, Taipei PLAS, TAITRONICS, Food Taipei, and Foodtech Taipei were earlier scheduled by TAITRA into TWTC Nangang this year. Not only the extensions of &lt;a href="w%3ACOMPUTEX%20Taipei"&gt;COMPUTEX Taipei&lt;/a&gt;, but also some similar industry shows will be exhibited at the TWTC during the show hours of Taipei Cycle and Taipei AMPA.

Even though the construction of &lt;a href="w%3ANeihu%20Line%20%28TRTS%29"&gt;Neihu Line of Taipei Metro&lt;/a&gt; is still in progress, but Chung-shing Bus Co., Ltd. and Kwang-hua Bus Co., Ltd. were approved to operate the "New Chung-hsiao Main Line" for solutions on current traffic condition. After the launch of TWTC Nangang, the "New Chung-hsiao Main Line" will temporarily improve traffic condition of TWTC Nangang.

The Wild are winless when playing the Hurricanes in &lt;a href="w%3ARaleigh%2C%20North%20Carolina"&gt;Raleigh&lt;/a&gt;; this was their third away game against Carolina since entering the NHL during the 2000-01 season.

<h3>Pittsburgh Penguins @ Florida Panthers</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Booth"&gt;David Booth&lt;/a&gt; scored the first goal of the game at 4:19. Less than a minute later, &lt;a href="w%3ARostislav%20Olesz"&gt;Rostislav Olesz&lt;/a&gt; scored his 12th goal of the season. &lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Malone"&gt;Ryan Malone&lt;/a&gt;'s goal cut the Panthers' lead in half less than two minutes after that. &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Weiss"&gt;Stephen Weiss&lt;/a&gt; put the Panthers back up by two goals late in the first period. &lt;a href="w%3ABrett%20McLean"&gt;Brett McLean&lt;/a&gt; increased Florida's lead to 3 about three and a half minutes into the second period. &lt;a href="w%3AKristopher%20Letang"&gt;Kristopher Letang&lt;/a&gt;'s goal about halfway through the period brought the Penguins within 2. The Florida Panthers added an empty net goal in the closing minute of the game by &lt;a href="w%3ABryan%20Allen%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;Bryan Allen&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3ASidney%20Crosby"&gt;Sidney Crosby&lt;/a&gt; assisted on the Letang goal, which was his second point in 2 games since his return to the lineup from a high ankle sprain. The Panthers have won their third in three games. &lt;a href="w%3ACraig%20Anderson%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;Craig Anderson&lt;/a&gt; stopped all but 2 of Pittsburgh's 27 shots, and earned his fourth straight win.
<h3>Ottawa Senators @ Los Angeles Kings</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Frolov"&gt;Alexander Frolov&lt;/a&gt; broke the scoreless tie 8:10 into the second period. &lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20O%27Sullivan"&gt;Patrick O'Sullivan&lt;/a&gt; scored Los Angeles' other goal, an empty net goal with 5 seconds left. &lt;a href="w%3AErik%20Ersberg"&gt;Erik Ersberg&lt;/a&gt; made 40 saves for the Kings, earning his first NHL career win and shutout. &lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20Gerber"&gt;Martin Gerber&lt;/a&gt; allowed just 1 of 31 shots for the Senators. This is the third straight loss for the Senators, all of which have come against Western conference teams. They will finish their 4 game road trip in Phoenix, another Western conference team on Saturday.
<h2>Wikinews Player of the Day</h2>

Zapatero spoke to members of the victims family ahead of making a statement from the Moncloa Palace in Madrid at 5pm this evening. He also spoke to the President of the Basque Parliament, &lt;a href="w%3AJuan%20Jos%C3%A9%20Ibarretxe"&gt;Juan José Ibarretxe&lt;/a&gt;.

Zapatero told the press that the "&lt;a href="w%3AETA"&gt;ETA&lt;/a&gt; is defeated by democracy," and that the Government wants to roundly manifest that those who took part in the shooting will be arrested shortly, and to express its solidarity with the family and companions of Isaías, in both the &lt;a href="w%3ASocialist%20Party%20of%20the%20Basque%20Country%20%E2%80%93%20Euskadiko%20Ezkerra"&gt;PSE Basque Socialist Party&lt;/a&gt; and in the &lt;a href="w%3AUni%C3%B3n%20General%20de%20Trabajadores"&gt;UGT trade union&lt;/a&gt;. 

"Those who carried out this attack will be found guilty," he said, "just as others had been for carrying out other attacks. The Government will put all its determination and resources to that. Today they have added one more victim to their list of disgrace." 

Zapatero continued, "We know that ETA is defeated by democracy and repudiated by the Spanish people together and by Basque Society. Its members have no other future than jail."
He added that the terrorists had wanted to interfere in the pacific process of the citizens being called to the polling booths, and said that the Spanish democracy would not be challenged by those who fight against its basic principles.

In his first comment since the shooting, the PP leader, Mariano Rajoy, said "Everybody knows what I am thinking. ETA must lose all hope of achieving their political objectives." He said the only possibility for ETA is to disappear. He expressed his solidarity with the family.

Spanish Interior Minister, &lt;a href="w%3AAlfredo%20P%C3%A9rez%20Rubalcaba"&gt;Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba&lt;/a&gt;, has commented that ETA ‘will never manage to crush Spanish society’.

♡❤Wikinews♡❤ held an exclusive interview with Kevin Baugh, president of the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20of%20Molossia"&gt;Republic of Molossia&lt;/a&gt;. Molossia is a &lt;a href="w%3Amicronation"&gt;micronation&lt;/a&gt; or entity that resembles an independent nation but which is unrecognized by world governments or major international organisations.

Molossia is situated on several acres of land in western &lt;a href="Nevada"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt;, within driving distance of &lt;a href="w%3AReno"&gt;Reno&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike most of today's micronations, Molossia allows visitors and has its own economy. It also has its own time zone and holidays as well as a few tourist attractions.

President Baugh said of his country, "Molossia is unique among
micronations in that we possess actual land, real terra firma upon which we
stake our national claim. Most micronations only exist on the internet and
don't have land. We are quite proud of our little country, and display all
the trappings of a full-fledged nation, including our flag, boundary
markers, signs, a couple of small tourist attractions and so forth, as well
as our own money, stamps, national anthem, navy and even a space program...Our goal is to exercise complete sovereignty over our country without annoying the United States." 

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; recognizes the territory claimed by Molossia as part of the United States and exercises the same dominion over it as it does over any other part of the country.

<h2>Interview</h2>

♡❤♡Tell us about your country. Why was it started? How long has it been in existence? Do you have a flag, national anthem or currency? Can one become a citizen?♡❤♡

♡❤♡President Baugh:♡❤♡ Molossia is a micronation, a self-declared and largely unrecognized country, one of dozens throughout the world. Molossia is unique among micronations in that we possess actual land, real terra firma upon which we stake our national claim. Most micronations only exist on the internet and don't have land. We are quite proud of our little country, and display all the trappings of a full-fledged nation, including our flag, boundary markers, signs, a couple of small tourist attractions and so forth, as well as our own money, stamps, national anthem, navy and even a space program. Molossia was founded in 1977 as the Grand Republic of Vuldstein. The name has changed since then, but the idea is the same - to have our own small country. We were intrigued and inspired by the movie "The Mouse That Roared", about a tiny country in Europe that declares war against the United States and wins by accident. The humor of that situation was not lost on us, and it spawned the idea that we, too, could have our own tiny nation. Once we obtained land 10 years ago, the idea became more real, that we were now standing in a foreign country, deep inside the United States. Since then, the Molossian experience has only grown stronger and more rewarding and we look forward to a long and interesting future for our little nation.

And to answer the last part, no, not everyone can become a citizen. You have to be a physical resident of Molossia to be a citizen, and we are closed to new immigrants at this time - we just don't have the room!
♡❤♡Today, there are hundreds of micronations that are little more than online chat groups. Is Molossia a serious micronation?♡❤♡

♡❤♡President Baugh:♡❤♡ I would say yes, we are serious. That is to say, serious within limits. Molossia is not a secessionist project. We are not taking up arms to declare independence nor starting an insurrection. However, beyond that, we are quite serious about our country. Our goal is to exercise complete sovereignty over our country without annoying the United States Government too much, and to have a good time doing it.
♡❤♡Molossia is surrounded by the United States. Do you consider yourself a Molossian or an American? Do you pay U.S. taxes?♡❤♡

♡❤♡President Baugh♡❤♡: I consider myself a dual citizen, both Molossian and American. Molossia is so small that we rely heavily on the US for support, goods, etc., so maintaining US citizenship is certainly desirable. In addition, it's often very difficult to explain that we have our own country out in the Nevada desert, so it's easier just to play both parts, American and Molossian. And yes, we do contribute to the coffers of the US Treasury annually, however, we call it "foreign aid". They need it, honestly.
♡❤♡Can people visit Molossia? Is tourism a vital part of your nation's economy?♡❤♡

♡❤♡President Baugh:♡❤♡ Yes, we welcome visitors to our country, although tourism is not a major source of income. In fact, we had 10 tourists visit last year. There are a few sights to see, but a visit usually only lasts about an hour. I escort all visitors around our nation and show them the sights, tell them about Molossia and even serve them cookie dough, our national treat. It's important, though, that visitors do not arrive uninvited. Please contact me first via e-mail and we will agree on a date and time.
♡❤♡Legally, can Molossia be considered an independent nation?♡❤♡

♡❤♡President Baugh:♡❤♡ Honestly, no. It takes a great deal of effort, time, money and especially legal wrangling to become fully independent, and we are nowhere near that point yet. No, we exist in a limbo state, at the good will of the US, and we are fine with that right now. After all, becoming independent can such a messy affair, and that would conflict with our relaxed lifestyle. We are happy to be the "country just down the road, on the left"!

An exchange of handshakes at a &lt;a href="w%3ALatin%20America"&gt;Latin America&lt;/a&gt;n summit Friday marked the end of the bitter dispute that had taken place between the nations of &lt;a href="Colombia"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Ecuador"&gt;Ecuador&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Venezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt; over the past week. The presidents of each country agreed to end the conflict, and said political ties would be reinstated.

"With the commitment of never attacking a brother country again and by asking forgiveness, we can consider this very serious incident resolved," said &lt;a href="Ecuador"&gt;Ecuador&lt;/a&gt;ian president &lt;a href="w%3ARafael%20Correa"&gt;Rafael Correa&lt;/a&gt;, as the other Latin American leaders applauded. 

The &lt;a href="w%3ARio%20Group"&gt;Rio Group&lt;/a&gt; summit, which included 20 Latin American nations, was originally planned to discuss other issues such as energy, but it soon erupted into a series of verbal attacks between Correa and Colombian president &lt;a href="w%3A%C3%81lvaro%20Uribe"&gt;Álvaro Uribe&lt;/a&gt;. The dispute was over Colombia's air strike against &lt;a href="w%3AFARC"&gt;FARC&lt;/a&gt; rebels, which Ecuador accused of entering their territory. As a result, Ecuador and their ally Venezuela had sent troops to their borders and severed ties with Colombia.

At the summit, Uribe charged Correa's government of having links with the FARC rebels, a charge that Correa quickly denied. "I cannot accept Uribe's lies," he said. "These hands are not tainted with blood." He admitted there had been communication with the FARC, but only regarding the release of hostages held by the rebels, including French-Colombian politician &lt;a href="w%3A%C3%8Dngrid%20Betancourt"&gt;Íngrid Betancourt&lt;/a&gt;. 

Uribe insisted that Ecuador has not done enough to fight the rebels, which was the reason the operation had to remain a secret, he said. "We have not gotten cooperation from President Correa in the fight against terrorism." Correa then advocated the creation of an international peacekeeping force to control the border, saying that Ecuador has become a victim of the fighting in Colombia.

Venezuelan president &lt;a href="Hugo%20Ch%C3%A1vez"&gt;Hugo Chávez&lt;/a&gt;, who was initially a central figure in the conflict, urged the leaders to stay calm. "We still have time to stop a whirlpool which we could regret," he said. "Let's reflect, let's be cool-headed." He also denied claims that he had supplied FARC with $300 million and offered to give them rifles. "I could have sent a lot of rifles to the FARC," Chávez said. "I will never do it because I want peace."

Finally, it was &lt;a href="Dominican%20Republic"&gt;Dominican&lt;/a&gt; president &lt;a href="w%3ALeonel%20Fernandez"&gt;Leonel Fernandez&lt;/a&gt; plea for peace that ended the feud. He requested that the presidents shake hands with each other, which they did, in a televised gesture viewed live across Latin America. &lt;a href="Nicaragua"&gt;Nicaragua&lt;/a&gt;'s president, &lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Ortega"&gt;Daniel Ortega&lt;/a&gt;, also agreed to reinstate diplomatic ties with Colombia after shaking hands with their president.

The leaders at the summit later approved a declaration in which Uribe apologized for the military operation and vowed never again to violate another nation's sovereignty. It also mentioned a commitment to fight against threats posed by "irregular or criminal groups."

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AViktor%20Bout"&gt;Viktor Bout&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , an international arms dealer, has been arrested in &lt;a href="Thailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;. Bout was arrested by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Thai%20Police"&gt;Royal Thai Police&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on Thursday, after checking in at a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASofitel"&gt;Sofitel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; luxury hotel in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASi%20Lom"&gt;Si Lom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; district of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABangkok"&gt;Bangkok&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Viktor Bout is suspected of supplying arms to the &lt;a href="Taliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Al-Qaeda"&gt;Al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFARC"&gt;FARC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , as well as combatants on both sides of &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;n civil wars. He has been dubbed the "Merchant of Death" by the press as well as the book ♡❤Merchant of Death: Money, Guns, Planes and the Man Who Makes War Possible♡❤ by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADouglas%20Farah"&gt;Douglas Farah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and Stephen Braun.

At a press conference held by Thai police they said that Bout is being investigated for "procuring weapons for terrorists and conspiring with terrorists." According to Maj. Gen. Surapol Thuanthong, Bout said "The game is over" when he was arrested.
"This multi-country operation culminating in the arrest of Viktor Bout in Thailand is a model for how suspected dangerous international criminals need to be investigated, charged and brought to justice in the 21st century," said &lt;a href="Interpol"&gt;Interpol&lt;/a&gt; Secretary General &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARonald%20Noble"&gt;Ronald Noble&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Federal prosecutors in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; hope to get Bout extradited for prosecution on charges of conspiracy to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization.

The 2005 film ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALord%20of%20War"&gt;Lord of War&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ has been said to have been inspired by Viktor Bout.

<h1>Vietnam bans pet hamsters</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Vietnam%20bans%20pet%20hamsters&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Fearing that their growing population might spread disease and destroy crops, &lt;a href="Vietnam"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt; has banned the sale and possession of &lt;a href="w%3Ahamsters"&gt;hamsters&lt;/a&gt;, which have launched somewhat of a subculture among the country's youth.

Starting Monday, the fine for trading or owning a hamster will reach up to 30 million dong (1,875 US dollars), the Ministry of Agriculture said. They express concern that hamsters have been imported illegally from &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Thailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;, and are left unlicensed and unchecked for diseases.

"Traders illegally carry hamsters across borders and do not register with customs to quarantine these animals," said a senior official of the Animal Health Department.

Although the Animal Health Department has said they will kill any hamster that has been imported illegally, there are no plans for a mass elimination of hamsters.

"Destroying them all is really a big problem," agriculture ministry official Nguyen Thanh Son said. "I think the Vietnam animal health department should take some samples, conduct tests, and see how dangerous the hamsters in Vietnam really are."

Hamsters arrived in Vietnam years ago for use in scientific research, but have only become popular recently. The rodents' increasing popularity with youngsters has been attributed to 2008 being the &lt;a href="w%3ARat%20%28zodiac%29"&gt;Year of the Rat&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AChinese%20Zodiac"&gt;Chinese Zodiac&lt;/a&gt;. 
Their adoration can be seen online, where there are numerous forums allowing hamster owners to talk about their beloved pets. The craze has even spawned offline "hamster clubs".

With less than a second remaining in regulation, &lt;a href="w%3ADan%20Fritsche"&gt;Dan Fritsche&lt;/a&gt; put a puck past &lt;a href="w%3AMathieu%20Garon"&gt;Mathieu Garon&lt;/a&gt;, sending the game to overtime. &lt;a href="w%3AAndrew%20Cogliano"&gt;Andrew Cogliano&lt;/a&gt; scored the game winner 1:53 into OT, giving the Oilers their 5th win in 6 games.

<h3>Minnesota Wild @ Atlanta Thrashers</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3ABrian%20Rolston"&gt;Brian Rolston&lt;/a&gt; scored the first goal of the game for Minnesota on a power play 10:47 through the first period, giving them a 1-0 lead they would hold through the second period. In the third period, &lt;a href="w%3AColby%20Armstrong"&gt;Colby Armstrong&lt;/a&gt; tied the score for the Thrashers. Minnesota retook a lead with 2:22 left in the third period, but &lt;a href="w%3AIlya%20Kovalchuk"&gt;Ilya Kovalchuk&lt;/a&gt; pushed in a puck that trickled along the goal line behind &lt;a href="w%3ANiklas%20Backstrom"&gt;Niklas Backstrom&lt;/a&gt;, to retie the score and send the game into overtime. In the shootout, &lt;a href="w%3AErik%20Christensen"&gt;Erik Christensen&lt;/a&gt; scored the only shootout goal of the night. &lt;a href="w%3AJohan%20Hedberg"&gt;Johan Hedberg&lt;/a&gt; made three stops, giving the Thrashers their first win in franchise history against the Minnesota Wild. The Thrashers also snap an 8 game winless streak. Minnesota has now lost their last three games.
<h3>San Jose Sharks @ Chicago Blackhawks</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3ABrent%20Seabrook"&gt;Brent Seabrook&lt;/a&gt; scored the first goal for Chicago on their first power play early in the first period.

Chicago thought they tied it up late in the third period, but the goal was reviewed and nullified because it was deflected in by &lt;a href="w%3ARene%20Bourque"&gt;Rene Bourque&lt;/a&gt;'s glove instead of his stick. &lt;a href="w%3AEvgeni%20Nabokov"&gt;Evgeni Nabokov&lt;/a&gt; made 17 saves for the Sharks in his 38th win of the season. Blackhawks goalie &lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Lalime"&gt;Patrick Lalime&lt;/a&gt; made 20 saves. &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Thornton"&gt;Joe Thornton&lt;/a&gt; had 3 points, assisting on all 3 San Jose goals.

Dumont&lt;/a&gt; scored to give the Predators the win. &lt;a href="w%3ADan%20Ellis"&gt;Dan Ellis&lt;/a&gt; stopped all but one of the Flames' 30 shots, and improved his record to 18-7-2. &lt;a href="w%3AMiikka%20Kiprusoff"&gt;Miikka Kiprusoff&lt;/a&gt; had 34 saves for Calgary.

<h1>President Bush vetoes CIA waterboarding ban</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=President%20Bush%20vetoes%20CIA%20waterboarding%20ban&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; has vetoed a bill that would have banned the &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Intelligence%20Agency"&gt;Central Intelligence Agency&lt;/a&gt; from using harsh interrogation techniques such as &lt;a href="w%3Awaterboarding"&gt;waterboarding&lt;/a&gt;, he said in his weekly radio address Saturday.

"Because the danger remains, we need to ensure our intelligence officials have all the tools they need to stop the terrorists," Bush said. "The bill Congress sent me would take away one of the most valuable tools in the war on terror - the CIA program to detain and question key terrorist leaders and operatives."

The bill, which passed the House of Representatives in November and the Senate in February despite warnings that it would be vetoed, established guidelines for intelligence activities. One of these guidelines would limit the CIA to only using interrogation methods allowed in the U.S. Army Field Manual. 

The relevant text of the bill reads:

Among the methods prohibited in the manual are stripping prisoners naked, forcing them to perform sexual acts, beating, electrocuting, or burning them, staging mock executions, withholding food and medical attention, and the controversial technique known as waterboarding.

Waterboarding involves pouring water over a prisoner's cloth-covered face in a simulation of drowning. It is condemned as torture by many nations, human rights groups, and members of Congress.

Although Bush did not specifically mention waterboarding in his address, he did hint to it in some of his statements. "The bill Congress sent me would not simply ban one particular interrogation method, as some have implied," he said. "Instead, it would eliminate all the alternative procedures we've developed to question the world's most dangerous and violent terrorists."

Bush said that the methods used by the military are designed for interrogating "lawful combatants captured on the battlefield", not the "hardened terrorists" normally questioned by the CIA. "If we were to shut down this program and restrict the CIA to methods in the Field Manual, we could lose vital information from senior al Qaida terrorists, and that could cost American lives," Bush said.

&lt;a href="Massachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; senator &lt;a href="w%3AEdward%20Kennedy"&gt;Edward Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; described Bush's veto as "one of the most shameful acts of his presidency". In a statement released Friday, he said, "Unless Congress overrides the veto, it will go down in history as a flagrant insult to the rule of law and a serious stain on the good name of America in the eyes of the world."

<h1>BBC Outside Broadcasts to be sold to Satellite Information Services</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=BBC%20Outside%20Broadcasts%20to%20be%20sold%20to%20Satellite%20Information%20Services&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3ASatellite%20Information%20Services"&gt;Satellite Information Services Limited&lt;/a&gt; (SIS), the racecourse television company part-owned by &lt;a href="w%3AWilliam%20Hill%20%28bookmaker%29"&gt;William Hill&lt;/a&gt; (19%) and &lt;a href="w%3ALadbrokes"&gt;Ladbrokes&lt;/a&gt; (23%), has been named by the &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; as the preferred bidder for its Outside Broadcasts division, one of three active businesses within &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20Resources"&gt;BBC Resources Ltd&lt;/a&gt;. Other SIS shareholders include, &lt;a href="w%3AThales%20Group"&gt;Thales&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ARacal"&gt;Racal&lt;/a&gt;) (23%), &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Business%20Media"&gt;United Business Media&lt;/a&gt; (19%), Racecourse Association (10%) and the &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Tote"&gt;Tote&lt;/a&gt; (6% - all figures rounded).

SIS Chief Executive David Holdgate would not comment on the terms of the deal, thought to be between &lt;a href="w%3APound%20sterling"&gt;£&lt;/a&gt;20m and £50m, but said it would be ♡❤"an ideal acquisition for SIS"♡❤ and ♡❤"a perfect fit with our existing SISLink and sports coverage"♡❤. The company has long-term contracts with other leading broadcasters, such as Sky and ITV and provides satellite links for live sport and news.

In a statement, the BBC said that it intended to exchange contracts and transfer the Outside Broadcasts business and around 300 staff in the near future, with Andrew Thornton, BBC project director for the sale of the division, saying that ♡❤"SIS offered the BBC a good deal and best value for licence fee payers"♡❤. Mark Tugwell, Director, BBC Outside Broadcasts, added ♡❤"it's time for our business to flourish under new ownership, without the constraints of BBC ownership"♡❤.

The transfer would mean that SIS will be covering major sporting events including the Beijing Olympics for the BBC in August 2008.

<h3>BBC Outside Broadcasts</h3>

The division — part of the BBC's commercial subsidiary, BBC Resources Ltd — owns a fleet of 15 television production units plus sound, support and communications vehicles (making a total fleet of over 90) and is based in self-contained premises in Langley, three miles north-west of &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Heathrow%20Airport"&gt;Heathrow&lt;/a&gt;. These units cover events ranging from music festivals and state occasions, to Wimbledon and World Cup football.

<h3>BBC Studios</h3>

On 7th March 2008 the surprise announcement was made that the studio operation — employing around 350 staff at Television Centre and Elstree — would be "♡❤retained by the Corporation as a commercial business♡❤" after failing to find a buyer.

<h3>BBC Post Production</h3>

The fate of this third business has yet to be announced with the BBC continuing negotiations with the preferred bidder "♡❤understood to be a company based in west London♡❤".

<h3>BBC Costume and Wigs</h3>

Was not included in the privatisation — in early October 2007 it was announced that the business was to close within six months and the entire stock sold as a complete collection. The sale fell through, and on 14th February 2008 the department ceased trading, with a BBC spokeswoman adding that ♡❤"the arrangements [the corporation] was pursuing have not worked out and BBC Resources is currently inviting interested parties to consider making an offer to purchase."♡❤

BBC Costume and Wigs — which had been trading as part of BBC Studios — was the second largest collection of its kind in the UK, after the leading suppliers &lt;a href="w%3AAngels%20and%20Bermans"&gt;Angels The Costumiers&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Background to the Resources sale</h2>

The Resources business-to-business unit was formed in 1998 and operates television studios, post-production and outside broadcast facilities for it's parent share-holding company, the BBC. It does not own any studios or premises, its assets being equipment and staff (approximately 960 plus 165 administration staff).

Advertised for sale on 16th August 2007 in the &lt;a href="w%3AFinancial%20Times"&gt;Financial Times&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Times"&gt;The Times&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABroadcast%20magazine"&gt;Broadcast&lt;/a&gt; and in 2006-07 making profits of £5.2 million with a revenue of £126 million, the disposal — led by &lt;a href="w%3AErnst%20%26amp%3B%20Young"&gt;Ernst &amp; Young&lt;/a&gt; — invited expressions of interest for the whole division or for each of its three operations separately. The BBC has yet to release the name of the preferred bidder for BBC Post Production. 

BBC Resources was the first of the BBC's commercial business-to-business divisions to be set up as a limited company and is the last to be sold, the BBC having previously divested itself of BBC Technology and &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20Broadcast"&gt;BBC Broadcast&lt;/a&gt;. BBC Enterprises, now known as &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20Worldwide"&gt;BBC Worldwide&lt;/a&gt;, remained in-house as now does &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20Studios"&gt;BBC Studios&lt;/a&gt;.

It had been intended to float Resources back in 2005, but this was postponed for two years following strike action and &lt;a href="w%3AAdvisory%2C%20Conciliation%20and%20Arbitration%20Service"&gt;ACAS&lt;/a&gt; talks in June 2005 — the BBC giving an undertaking that there would be no preparations made to sell the company until January 2007, and no sale allowed before July 2007. It had been hoped to dispose of all three divisions by the end of this month.

Almost exactly one year ago, on March 7, &lt;a href="w%3AGaruda%20Indonesia"&gt;Garuda Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGaruda%20Indonesia%20Flight%20200"&gt;Flight 200&lt;/a&gt; crashed during landing at &lt;a href="w%3AAdisucipto%20International%20Airport"&gt;Adisucipto International Airport&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href="w%3AYogyakarta"&gt;Yogyakarta&lt;/a&gt;, after a scheduled domestic &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;n passenger flight. 21 people - 16 Indonesians and five &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;ns - were killed when the &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing"&gt;Boeing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20737"&gt;737-400&lt;/a&gt; overshot the runway, crossed a road, struck an embankment and burst into flames in a rice paddy. Overall, the plane had traveled 252m beyond the extreme end of the runway.

The final report, released in October, blamed &lt;a href="w%3Apilot%20error"&gt;pilot error&lt;/a&gt; for the disaster. The report stated that the aircraft had approached at a speed far exceeding that at which the &lt;a href="w%3Awing%20flaps"&gt;wing flaps&lt;/a&gt; could properly operate, and attempted to execute a landing at 408 kph (254 mph), which is 160 kph (100 mph) above the safe speed. It also found that captain Marwoto Komar had ignored fifteen activations of the &lt;a href="w%3AGround%20Proximity%20Warning%20System"&gt;Ground Proximity Warning System&lt;/a&gt; (GPWS) informing Mr Komar that the aircraft was flying at a speed beyond that at which it could safely land, but he failed to abort.

It also commented that he missed one further opportunity for emergency evasive action when the airliner struck the runway and bounced into the air, at which point co-pilot Gagam Rochmana requested a '&lt;a href="w%3Ago-around"&gt;go-around&lt;/a&gt;' procedure be initiated, but was also ignored. It further criticised Mr Komar for singing during final approach, a direct violation of the Garuda Basic Operations Manual, which calls for activation of the &lt;a href="w%3ASterile%20Cockpit%20Rule"&gt;Sterile Cockpit Rule&lt;/a&gt; at 10,000 feet and below.

Mr Rochmana was also criticised for his failure to take control away from Mr Komar when it became apparent that the aircraft was being operated in an unsafe manner. However, the report did note that Garuda Indonesia had failed to give him any simulator training replicating a situation whereby the co-pilot would take over control duties from the pilot in charge due to unsafe handling of the plane; in fact, training was found to be inadequate for both members of the cockpit crew.

Further criticisms were also leveled at airport and governmental authorities for failures in their respective roles to provide safety features and to enforce regulations.

However, the Indonesian authorities have recently generated intense controversy by deciding to prosecute Mr Komar for his role in the disaster. The move has been pushed for by some, but met with opposition by others.

, Australian foreign minister at the time of the crash, immediately said "...I am very glad that they have reached a point now where they have charged the captain of the aircraft." The unusually high number of Australians amongst the 140 passengers on board was attributable to a visit by Mr Downer. 

One of those was &lt;a href="w%3AMorgan%20Mellish"&gt;Morgan Mellish&lt;/a&gt; of the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Financial%20Review"&gt;Australian Financial Review&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, who died in the crash. His sister, Caroline Mellish, had specifically called for prosecution to be avoided, saying "I think having 21 deaths on your conscience is probably enough. I don't think prosecuting the man is going to make any difference."

There were fierce calls for prosecution of both pilots immediately after the report's release, with Downer himself pressuring the Indonesian authorities, citing the "very credible report" and saying "I've asked our ambassador today (October 24) to make it absolutely clear to the Indonesians that we want people prosecuted for this accident. I want to see people who have negligently allowed Australians … to be killed, I want to see those people brought to justice."

Australian Opposition Leader &lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Rudd"&gt;Kevin Rudd&lt;/a&gt; also made clear a desire for prosecutions, saying he had telephoned secretary-general of Indonesia's foreign affairs department and former ambassador to Australia Imron Cotan, telling him that he wanted those responsible "prosecuted to the absolute full". "This is a serious matter, many Australians visit Indonesia, Garuda is an often used airline and there is a basic national interest at stake here as well," he said.

National Transport Safety Committee chairman Tatang Kurniadi said at the time that no information from the report could be used in any criminal or civil liability investigations. "I would like to go back to the objective of this, the report was made by NTSC for safety purposes only, not for blaming, he said. "If any institution wants to ... follow up that accident, that's their own decision. The report contained the results from the &lt;a href="w%3Acockpit%20voice%20recorder"&gt;cockpit voice recorder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aflight%20data%20recorder"&gt;flight data recorder&lt;/a&gt;, but according to international regulations on aviation these black boxes are not allowed to be used for... liability purposes. We will not give police or any institution (information) other than for safety purposes only - it's in international regulations and we want to follow those regulations." He also confirmed that investigators cannot speak to the police, with the only permitted testimony under the legislation being to testify at a court hearing, and pointed out that the document does not actually appoint any blame.

The international legislation he was referring to is probably the &lt;a href="w%3AConvention%20on%20International%20Civil%20Aviation"&gt;Convention on International Civil Aviation&lt;/a&gt;, which stipulates that accident reports and related material, specifically transcripts of interviews, communications with crew and cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder (collectively known as black boxes) readouts, must not be used for any purpose other than determining the cause of an &lt;a href="w%3Aaviation%20accidents%20and%20incidents"&gt;accident or incident&lt;/a&gt;. The only possible exception to this is where potential benefit would outweigh the "adverse domestic and international impact" on the investigation in question or any other either in progress or in the future. This legislation is in place to provide protection to witnesses on the basis that without it they may be less likely to cooperate with investigational procedures.

The law caused was actively opposed by some. Aridono Sukman, the police member in charge of the criminal investigation, said that the contents of the black box were vital evidence. Officials commented that some relatives had expressed their frustration over the legal challenges involved in the prosecution effort.

Early in February Mr Komar was arrested; he has subsequently been charged with manslaughter charges which carry a maximum sentence of five years' imprisonment. The &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Federation%20of%20Air%20Line%20Pilots%20Associations"&gt;International Federation of Air Line Pilots Associations&lt;/a&gt; (IFALPA) issued a press release condemning this move, saying that further investigations are needed into the crash, and that criminal proceedings could prevent an accurate version of events from ever being known. Specifically, the release said that "IFALPA believes that the circumstances of the accident as set forth in the final report of the Indonesian investigation authority leaves many serious questions concerning the crew actions prior to the accident. Central to these concerns are the underlying reasons for the reported behavior of Captain Marwoto Komar. Experienced pilots have considerable difficulty in attempting to explain what is reported in the context of normal airline operations. The Federation believes that the explanations proffered by the report do not square with the collective experience of our members." The release went on to state the opinion that prosecution may bring total foreclosure to the case and could only be counterproductive. It also said "He remains a professional who was involved in an unfortunate tragedy."

One possible explanation had previously been suggested by the head of the Garuda pilots association, Stephanus Geraldus. He said that marital problems between Mr Komar and his wife Norma Andriani were "common knowledge" and was backed up by an industry analyst and pilot who said he believed the couple had been arguing late into the night, and expressed concern that the report had not addressed psychological issues. Mr Geraldus also said sleep deprivation could have contributed, with the flight crew reporting for duty at 4:30 am and the flight departing an hour and a half later.

The report had hinted at problems, saying The pilot was probably emotionally aroused because his conscious awareness moved from the relaxed mode “singing” to the heightened stressfulness of the desire to reach the runway by making an excessively steep and fast, unstabilised approach,” and "His attention was fixated or channelised on landing the aircraft on the runway and he either did not hear, or disregarded the GPWS alerts, and warnings, and calls from the copilot to go around." It is also known that Mr Komar had been under police surveillance, during which time he was receiving psychological treatment. 

The Indonesian Pilot's Association has also said that the criminal prosecution should be avoided, arguing that the only people who can judge whether mistakes were made in aviation are those professionally involved and not the police. There were protests in Jakarta demanding his release and dozens of pilots across the nation also campaigned. Meanwhile, two survivors, Adrianus Meliala and Retno Gunowati, went to the House of Representatives (DPR) to challenge those opposed to legal processes against the pilot.

Mr Komar was released on police bail on February 15, and is currently awaiting trial. He was forced to resign late in February with being fired his only alternative, and his licence has been suspended. He is believed to be the only man ever prosecuted in Indonesian history over an airliner crash.

The issues thrown up by this ongoing case have now been exclusively commented on for ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ by Paul McCarthy. Mr McCarthy is IFALPA's representative to the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Civil%20Aviation%20Organisation"&gt;International Civil Aviation Organisation&lt;/a&gt; (ICAO). He is both a pilot - as are all of IFALPA's roughly 100,000 members - and a lawyer, and is an acknowledged expert on issues concerning the criminal liability of pilots. Mr McCarthy's comments, obtained by email via IFALPA media representative Gideon Ewers are available below.

<h2>Interview</h2>
 IFALPA's press release expresses difficulty in explaining Mr Komar's behaviour. It has been suggested that it could be caused by a combination of marital problems and sleep deprivation. Do you feel that this alone could explain what happened?

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Paul McCarthy:♡❤♡ I have no idea why the Captain acted as he seems to have done. We are recommending that that is the proper job of the accident investigation team. The allegation of “tunnel vision” simply does not answer the issue.

</ul>
&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; In your own estimation, without necessary evidence from psychology experts, do you believe Mr Komar's mental condition was such as to render him unfit to stand trial and take responsibility for his actions?

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡PM:♡❤♡ As above, we do not speculate. The Captain has a legal team which is charged with such determinations

</ul>
&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; The Convention on International Civil Aviation states that various investigative materials cannot be used to establish criminal or civil liability, but makes an exception where the benefit would outweigh the negative effect on aviation investigations. How would such a situation be determined, and is there a serious possibility of this happening here?

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡PM:♡❤♡ The standard requires, in this case, the court to make the balancing determination. The question becomes, if certain voluntary disclosures made to the investigators are subsequently used in prosecution, what is the probability that such disclosures will no longer be made in future investigations. If they are withheld, will the investigation, and by inference safety suffer?

</ul>
&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; What evidence is available to the prosecution? Is a conviction possible even if the authorities are blocked from using evidence from the investigation?

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡PM:♡❤♡ The ideal situation is that the police independently investigate and procure their own evidence. Is a conviction possible? I don’t know.

</ul>
&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; One official expressed a desire to call in the investigators as &lt;a href="w%3Aexpert%20witness"&gt;expert witness&lt;/a&gt;es because they cannot use their testimony as investigators. Does this loophole really exist, or can it be prevented?

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡PM:♡❤♡ It depends on the rules of evidence in Indonesia. It should not be possible to call the active investigators as expert witnesses. To do so would subvert both the investigation and the court proceeding.

</ul>
&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Based on your own experience, what structure is Mr Komar's defence likely to take?

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡PM:♡❤♡ Again, the Captain has a legal team.

</ul>
&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; If convicted, what kind of appeals process does Indonesian law supply to Mr Komar?

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡PM:♡❤♡ I have no idea.

</ul>
&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; There are a number of other individuals and organisations that could potential also face legal action for their roles in the disaster, but only Mr Komar has. Why do you believe this is?

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡PM:♡❤♡ I once again will not speculate in this area.

</ul>
&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Despite not having faced trial, Garuda Indonesia have recently forced Mr Komar to resign. Do you feel this move was justified?

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡PM:♡❤♡ It was expected and is quite common in many parts of the world, with or without establishment of culpability. It is a matter of face for the corporation.

</ul>
&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Do you feel Mr Komar's case sets a precedent for the industry?

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡PM:♡❤♡ Unfortunately, it is simply the most recent example of this attitude that somehow prosecution will improve safety. It will not.

</ul>
&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Have there been any previous cases in other nations that could in any way be compared to this? How were they resolved?

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡PM:♡❤♡ Each accident has a different fact situation, so it is difficult if not impossible to use one as precedent. The most famous is probably the &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; case at &lt;a href="w%3APalmerston%20North%20International%20Airport"&gt;Palmerston North (International Airport)&lt;/a&gt; where the captain was prosecuted following a crash. Even though he seemed guilty under the applicable statute, the jury refused to convict.

</ul>
&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Do you believe Australia was right to push for prosecution so soon after the report was published?

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡PM:♡❤♡ No. If this accident was in Australia, their own laws would preclude much of what has happened. In fact, the Australian position could be viewed as a cynical political move.

</ul>
&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Had the co-pilot been adequately trained he would have taken over the operation of the plane and averted an accident. Does this have any bearing on Mr Komar's case?

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡PM:♡❤♡ To answer this one must compare cultures and the ability to train cultural bias out of the reactions of a crewmember. Once again, the investigation should have addressed this issue but did not.

</ul>
&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Why do you feel the final report fails to address the issues IFALPA are calling for it to consider?

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡PM:♡❤♡ I would restate my answers above to the questions concerning the crew actions. The investigation has not addressed them in a way that will be useful as a guide for the industry to act to prevent a reoccurrence.

</ul>
&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Do you believe there ever will be another investigation?

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡PM:♡❤♡ No.

</ul>
&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; If a full investigation into Mr Komar's psychology conclusively found that he was of sound mind at the time, would that change IFALPA's stance on the prosecution?

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡PM:♡❤♡ No. we are not interested so much in a sound mind as we are the reactions of a professional airman to a certain set of stimuli. Where, as seems to be the case here, the reactions are totally unresponsive, it is not sufficient to give a glib answer, either “tunnel vision” or “psychological problems”. The industry needs to understand the mechanism so that it can be identified and remediated prior to it once again causing an accident.

</ul>
&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Does the fact that this prosecution has gone ahead indicate to you that changes in the law may be required?

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡PM:♡❤♡ Time will tell as the prosecution is continuing.

</ul>
&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; To what extent is a pilot protected by law in event of an accident caused by his or her negligent conduct?

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡PM:♡❤♡ The issue that ICAO, IFALPA, &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Air%20Transport%20Association"&gt;IATA FSF&lt;/a&gt; and every other serious observer has addressed is the use of the word negligent. Ordinary negligence can be attempting to get it right and not succeeding. The level of negligence that should trigger prosecution would have a component of intent to either do harm or to disregard the high probability that harm would occur. This is variously described as gross negligence or willful and wanton misconduct. To prosecute someone for attempting to deal with a particular situation and getting it wrong adds nothing to the safety mix.

</ul>
&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Would you still get into an aircraft that you knew Mr Komar was piloting, assuming he was confirmed to be of sound mind at the time?

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡PM:♡❤♡ We can assume that a proper training and evaluation program will make certain, to the highest degree possible, that all flight crew members are fully fit to perform their duties. A proper explanation in this instance would have assisted Airline training departments in fulfilling this mission.

</ul>
&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; How big do you believe the impact would be if Mr Komar were convicted?

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡PM:♡❤♡ On whom?

</ul>
&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; The effect on safety in general.

&lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; has won the &lt;a href="Wyoming"&gt;Wyoming&lt;/a&gt; Democratic caucus Saturday, furthering his delegate lead in the close race against &lt;a href="Hillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt;. 

Obama had 61 percent of the vote, beating out Clinton's 38 percent. 7 of Wyoming's 12 pledged delegates will to go to Obama, while 5 will go to Clinton. This would put Obama's delegate count at 1,578 and Clinton's at 1,468, according to the Associated Press. 2,025 delegates are needed to seal the nomination.

"This is a very important win for us," said Obama campaign manager David Plouffe. "I think it's evidence that Senator Obama is going to be able to put more states in play because of his strength with independent voters."

Clinton's campaign manager called the caucus a "near split in delegates" and thanked supporters for coming out to vote. "Although the Obama campaign predicted victory in Wyoming weeks ago, we worked hard to present Senator Clinton's vision to the caucus-goers and we thank them for turning out today," she said.

With a largely Republican voting base, Wyoming has usually been ignored by Democratic candidates. But in this caucus, excitement was evident in the unusually high turnout, which resulted in long lines, packed rooms, and late arrivals that had to be turned away. "I'm worried about where we're going to put them all," said Joyce Corcoran, a local party official. "But I guess everybody's got the same problem." 

Both Obama and Clinton were campaigning in Wyoming the day before the caucus. At town hall meeting in &lt;a href="w%3ACasper%2C%20Wyoming"&gt;Casper&lt;/a&gt;, Obama criticized Clinton's 2002 authorization of the &lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20War"&gt;Iraq War&lt;/a&gt;, and defended against Clinton's accusations that he wouldn't immediately pull troops out of Iraq if elected.

"I will bring this war to an end in 2009, so don't be confused ... when Senator Clinton is not willing to acknowledge that she voted for war," Obama said. "I don't want to play politics on this issue, because she doesn't have standing to question my position on this issue."

The candidates' presence in Wyoming came as a surprise to many, including Democratic Party spokesman Bill Luckett. "Seriously, I never imagined when I took this job that we would see the day when the two front-runners for the Democratic presidential nomination would hold events in Wyoming on the eve of our county caucuses," he said.

The next Democratic contest will be the &lt;a href="Mississippi"&gt;Mississippi&lt;/a&gt; primary on Tuesday, where there are 33 pledged delegates at stake.

An &lt;a href="w%3AAriane%205"&gt;Ariane 5ES&lt;/a&gt; rocket has launched the first &lt;a href="w%3AAutomated%20Transfer%20Vehicle"&gt;Automated Transfer Vehicle&lt;/a&gt; or ATV. The spacecraft, named &lt;a href="w%3AJules%20Verne%20ATV"&gt;♡❤Jules Verne♡❤, and also known as ATV-001&lt;/a&gt;, has been described as the most advanced ever built in &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;. It will now begin about a month of testing, prior to its scheduled docking with the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Space%20Station"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt; (ISS) in early April. The launch of the ATV marks the culmination of a thirteen-year development programme, and the start of a six-month mission to test the spacecraft and resupply the ISS. &lt;a href="w%3AArianespace"&gt;Arianespace&lt;/a&gt; conducted the launch on behalf of the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Space%20Agency"&gt;European Space Agency&lt;/a&gt;, who will be responsible for the ATV's operation. A second burn of the upper stage was performed at around 05:06 GMT. Launch operations concluded with spacecraft separation from the carrier rocket at 05:09, and control of the ATV was transferred to the &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; space agency, &lt;a href="w%3ACNES"&gt;CNES&lt;/a&gt;, who will control it from a centre in &lt;a href="w%3AToulouse"&gt;Toulouse&lt;/a&gt;. Deployment of the spacecraft's solar arrays was confirmed at around 05:40 GMT.

The Ariane 5ES rocket, which was making its maiden flight, lifted off from &lt;a href="w%3AELA-3"&gt;ELA-3&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AGuiana%20Space%20Centre"&gt;Guiana Space Centre&lt;/a&gt; at 04:03:04 GMT this morning. The Ariane 5ES was designed primarily to be used for European government programmes, such as the ATV, and &lt;a href="w%3AGalileo%20%28satellite%20navigation%29"&gt;Galileo&lt;/a&gt;. It uses the first stage of a heavy-lift Ariane 5ECA, with a restartable upper stage from the Ariane 5GS. It will replace the Ariane 5GS, which is scheduled to retire later this year. It is the first European launch of the year, with the next, using an Ariane 5ECA, scheduled for early April, with &lt;a href="Brazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;lian satellite &lt;a href="w%3AStar%20One%20C2"&gt;Star One C2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AVinasat-1"&gt;Vinasat-1&lt;/a&gt;, the first &lt;a href="Vietnam"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;ese spacecraft. The next ATV is scheduled for launch in late 2009.

The ATV will remain in orbit for around six months, before being replaced at the ISS by a smaller &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href="w%3AProgress%20spacecraft"&gt;Progress spacecraft&lt;/a&gt;. When this happens, the ATV will be de-orbited, and will burn up on re-entry. The launch is the culmination of thirteen years of planning and preparation, and the programme is already three years behind schedule. The launch of ♡❤Jules Verne♡❤ had previously been delayed from July, September and November 2007, and from February 2008. A further delay, from Saturday, was caused by a problem with the system that the ATV uses to separate from its carrier rocket. 

Speaking after the launch, Arianespace chairman &lt;a href="w%3AJean-Yves%20Le%20Gall"&gt;Jean-Yves Le Gall&lt;/a&gt; remarked that the launch was "perfect", and that the launch shows that Europe is a "major player" in manned spaceflight. ESA administrator &lt;a href="w%3AJean-Jacques%20Dordain"&gt;Jean-Jacques Dordain&lt;/a&gt; commented that ESA was "embarking on an extraordinary voyage", and that "as of today ESA is an essential partner...of the International Space Station". He also said that Europe was "on [its] way to becoming a major partner in the ISS", and that the successful launch "would not have been possible the support of ESA's member states".

The ATV's launch comes two days ahead of the scheduled launch of the next mission to visit the Space Station, &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle"&gt;Space Shuttle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Endeavour"&gt;♡❤Endeavour♡❤&lt;/a&gt;, which will begin mission &lt;a href="w%3ASTS-123"&gt;STS-123&lt;/a&gt; at 06:28:12 GMT on Tuesday. ♡❤Endeavour♡❤ will deliver the first pressurised section of the &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;ese &lt;a href="w%3AJapanese%20Experiment%20Module"&gt;Experiment Module&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt;-built &lt;a href="w%3ADextre"&gt;Dextre&lt;/a&gt; component for the Space Station's &lt;a href="w%3ACanadarm2"&gt;robotic arm&lt;/a&gt;.

Several hours after launch, a problem was reported to have developed with the number two Propulsion Drive Electronics (PDE) unit. This is responsible for control over a quarter of the ATV's manoeuvring thrusters. All engine burns have been delayed or cancelled whilst the fault is investigated.

This is the eighth orbital launch of &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20in%20spaceflight"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;. The 20-tonne ATV is the heaviest spacecraft ever launched by a European rocket.

The &lt;a href="Minnesota"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; Department of Health (MDH) has said that bars do not become exempt from to Freedom to Breathe Act by holding ‘theatre nights.’ The act, which is designed to ban smoking in bars, excludes actors in theatrical performances. The MDH has, however, said that "theatre nights being held in bars do not fall within the theatrical production exemption of the Freedom to Breathe Act."

The press release by the MDM said that "in reviewing the law, MDH has determined that it has the authority to address theater nights and take enforcement action if the activity is an attempt to allow smoking in violation of the act." It continued by saying that "the Minnesota Commissioner of Health Dr. Sanne Magnan said MDH will work together with local health agencies to bring establishments into compliance if they violate the law."

The theatre nights sometimes involve bars calling the visitors to the bars "cast" with the entrance becoming a "stage entrance:" or something similar. The Minnesota Commissioner of Health commented on these actions by saying that "The law was enacted to protect Minnesotans from the serious health effects of secondhand smoke," and that "We [the MDH] expect all establishments to comply with the law. It is time for the curtain to fall on these theatrics so that employees, and all Minnesotans, are protected from secondhand smoke."

In two separate cases, &lt;a href="China"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; police have captured and killed suspected terrorists apparently targeting the &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20Summer%20Olympics"&gt;2008 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt;, and an airplane crew thwarted what appeared to be a planned hijacking, top officials said at a parliament session Sunday. 

The suspect terrorist gang was found on January 27 in &lt;a href="w%3AUrumqi"&gt;Urumqi&lt;/a&gt;, capital of the &lt;a href="w%3AXinjiang"&gt;Xinjiang&lt;/a&gt; region in northwest China. Two were killed and fifteen others were arrested. Police seized axes, knives, grenades, and "books about terrorism". 

"Obviously, the gang had planned an attack targeting the Olympics," said Wang Lequan, Xinjiang's &lt;a href="w%3ACommunist%20Party%20of%20China"&gt;Communist Party&lt;/a&gt; chief. "The Olympic Games slated for this August is a big event, but there are always a few people who conspire to commit sabotage. It is no longer a secret now."

The gang was said to have collaborated with the &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Turkestan%20Islamic%20Movement"&gt;East Turkestan Islamic Movement&lt;/a&gt;, a separatist movement labeled a terrorist organization by the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;. "Those terrorists, saboteurs and secessionists are to be battered resolutely, no matter what ethnic group they are from," said Wang. 

Xinjiang is home to a many ethnic &lt;a href="w%3ATurkic%20peoples"&gt;Turkic&lt;/a&gt; groups, the largest of which are the &lt;a href="w%3AUyghur%20people"&gt;Uyghur&lt;/a&gt;.
Nur Bekri, chairman of the Xinjiang government and himself an Uyghur, says only a very small minority support the views of the East Turkestan Islamic Movement. "They don't represent the Uighur people," he said.

In another incident, an airplane destined for &lt;a href="w%3ABeijing"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt; was forced to land early after "some people were attempting to create an air disaster," said Nur Bekri, chairman of the Xinjiang government.

The plane took off from Urumqi on Friday and landed in &lt;a href="w%3ALanzhou"&gt;Lanzhou&lt;/a&gt;, capital of the neighboring &lt;a href="w%3AGansu"&gt;Gansu&lt;/a&gt; province. The flight crew stopped the alleged attackers, and all passengers and crew are reported to be safe. The plane finally arrived in Beijing Saturday morning.

"Fortunately our air crew took resolute measures, discovered and put a stop to this action promptly. All the passengers, crew and the aircraft are safe," Bekri said.

No further details were made available. The suspects are in custody, as police try to find out "who the people involved in the incident were, where they were from, what their aim was and what their background was", Bekri said. An airline official did not confirm whether the incident was a terrorist attack, saying "it's up to the police department to verify." However, Bekri believes "we can be sure that this was a case intending to create an air crash."

An anonymous source told &lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt; that flammable material was found in the plane's toilet, and that at least 2 passengers on the flight have been taken into custody for questioning.

2008 Tour de Taiwan, with 7 different divisions and 8 stages, started yesterday at &lt;a href="w%3ALove%20River"&gt;Love River&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AKaohsiung%20City"&gt;Kaohsiung City&lt;/a&gt; as its first stage. Not only a site event named "Walking in the Love River for &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Games%202009"&gt;World Games 2009&lt;/a&gt;" (in Chinese: 愛河健走，世運加油) was held to support the 2009 World Games in Kaohsiung City, but also a damn hot weather challenged for cyclists' physical strength.

In the starting of the 3rd lap, there was a sudden blow sound near the 50m flag. According to some witnesses, a cyclist from &lt;a href="w%3AHealth%20Net%20Pro%20Cycling%20Team"&gt;Health Net Pro Cycling Team&lt;/a&gt; was forced to quit this race because his tire blew suddenly due to a damn hot weather and the temperature of the race lane progressively rose up.

By the way of this race, not every cyclist could get rid off the chasing groups until some 5 cyclists suddenly get rid off them to become the leading group. Finally, &lt;a href="w%3AWong%20Kam-po"&gt;Kam-po Wong&lt;/a&gt; reverse this condition in the final lap and won the champion of this stage. Indirectly, he also won the Asian and general leading champion in this stage.

In the After Race Media Interview, ♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ Reporter questioned about his reversal in this stage and the future challenges for next 7 stages, Wong said:

Coincidentally, before the racing, a team member of Jet Fuel Coffee Cycling Team from &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; said to Wikinews:

<h1>International Board fixes soccer field size, halts technology experiments</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=International%20Board%20fixes%20soccer%20field%20size%2C%20halts%20technology%20experiments&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Football%20Association%20Board"&gt;International Football Association Board&lt;/a&gt; (IFAB), the body that decides on the laws of the game, has decided to discontinue all experiments involving &lt;a href="technology"&gt;technology&lt;/a&gt;, and for the first time has also decided on the exact size of a &lt;a href="soccer"&gt;soccer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFootball%20pitch"&gt;field&lt;/a&gt;.

Instead of pursuing the idea of using cameras or microchips in the ball to see if it has crossed the goal-line, the International Board wants to see if the introduction of two extra &lt;a href="w%3AAssistant%20referee%20%28association%20football%29"&gt;assistant referee&lt;/a&gt;s can improve the quality of referee's decisions.

&lt;a href="w%3AFIFA"&gt;FIFA&lt;/a&gt; general secretary Jerome Valcke declared: "We have decided to freeze for the time being the goal-line technology and all technology experiments. We will look on these two additional referees and we avoid considering any goal-line technology during this time."

FIFA President &lt;a href="w%3ASepp%20Blatter"&gt;Sepp Blatter&lt;/a&gt; said the move was necessary to maintain the universal spirit of the game: "We have 260 million people directly involved in the game. If we maintain the laws of the game ... it's so easy to understand ... We have to live with errors, football has to keep its human face."

"We have to maintain the laws of the game in their simplicity. Do you want technical devices to take decisions? That's why, after three years of tests with no conclusions, I am in favour of putting the whole thing on ice," Blatter explained.
&lt;a href="w%3AUEFA"&gt;UEFA&lt;/a&gt; president &lt;a href="w%3AMichel%20Platini"&gt;Michel Platini&lt;/a&gt; agreed: "Football should stay human, but two more officials can help, especially around the goal." Platini made the suggestion to freeze all investigations into technology and to try two additional assistants behind each goal.

Blatter said the system using the microchip "was very complicated, needing electrified lines on the field of play and other devices including antennae and when we tested it in Tokyo last year there was one mistake during the seven matches we used as an experiment at the Club World Championship." With regards to the system using cameras, he pointed to "problems with players obscuring the views of the cameras, or of flares or weather conditions."

The system of the extra referees will be tested at an upcoming FIFA or UEFA tournament, and a final ruling is expected at next year's meeting, according to FIFA's Jerome Valcke.

&lt;a href="w%3AHawk-Eye"&gt;Hawk-Eye&lt;/a&gt;, the company that was working on the goal-line technology that is already being used for line calls in &lt;a href="tennis"&gt;tennis&lt;/a&gt;, reacted with disappointment: "I'm livid, it is completely out of the blue... A year ago they met and gave us four criteria to meet and we have met all of them, yet they have kicked it out now... We have invested an awful lot of money and now we have no return on that investment," director Paul Hawkins said. He said he was encouraged to continue research on the project only 10 days ago at a private showing for IFAB members at &lt;a href="w%3AReading%2C%20Berkshire"&gt;Reading's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMadejski%20Stadium"&gt;Madejski Stadium&lt;/a&gt;.
While the &lt;a href="Wales"&gt;Welsh&lt;/a&gt; FA were also against the idea, the &lt;a href="England"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Football%20Association"&gt;Football Association&lt;/a&gt; supported the use of technology and was hoping to start using it by next season. The FA clubs and referees supported the use of Hawk-Eye technology, said Mike Foster, general secretary of the English &lt;a href="w%3APremier%20League"&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt;. A spokesperson of the Premier League said that "A lot of time, money and effort has gone into developing a system that meets all the criteria laid down last year." The Scottish and Northern Irish FA also voted in favour of the goal-line technology.

FA chief executive Brian Barwick expressed his disappointment at the annual meeting of the IFAB in &lt;a href="w%3AGleneagles"&gt;Gleneagles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Scotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;: "We were in favour of goal-line technology but there will be no more experiments and it will not be back on the agenda next year, or in the foreseeable future." 

FIFA President Blatter denied ulterior motives for the decision: "There has been no change of heart. Referees make decisions, not machines... I have defended goal-line technology but it has become clear that such systems are too complicated and very costly. Nor would they necessarily add anything positive to the game and could harm the authority of the referee."

<h2>Fixed size for football pitch</h2>
Another decision at Gleneagles was to fix the size of a soccer field for men's international matches at 105 x 68 metres. Until now, football's law number 1 stated that the field could be between 100 and 110 metres long and 64 to 75 metres wide. The Welsh Football Association proposed the change, arguing that size variation was an advantage for home teams, who could alter the size of the field against what the visiting team was used to.

The IFAB also agreed to simplify the text of the soccer rules at several points. The last major revision of the text was 11 years ago. The IFAB also condemned violent tackles, warning that "players committing such acts should be banned."

The International Board, established in 1886, is currently made up of eight members, four representing the FIFA and four others from the English, Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish Football association. Six members need to agree to confirm an IFAB ruling. Next year's meeting will be held in &lt;a href="Northern%20Ireland"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt;.

A 23-year old man from &lt;a href="w%3ASmiths%20Station%2C%20Alabama"&gt;Smiths Station&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Alabama"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt; has been arrested for the murder of &lt;a href="w%3ALauren%20Burk"&gt;Lauren Burk&lt;/a&gt;, an 18-year old &lt;a href="w%3AAuburn%20University"&gt;Auburn University&lt;/a&gt; student. Burk had been found March 4th along Alabama &lt;a href="w%3AAlabama%20State%20Route%20147"&gt;Highway 147&lt;/a&gt;, fatally injured from a single gunshot wound. Courtney L. Lockhart has been charged with capital murder during a kidnapping, capital murder during a robbery and capital murder during an attempted rape.

Burk's murder drew national interest. Gov. &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Riley"&gt;Bob Riley&lt;/a&gt; offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the murderer(s). A combined local, state, and federal task force investigated the case.

Shortly after the murder, Burk's car was found burning on the Auburn campus. The next day investigators discovered a surveillance photo of Lockhart buying gas at a local mini-mart near where Burk's body was found. They had their suspect but they didn't know who he was.

Lockhart was arrested March 7 after a high-speed chase. He had been stopped for speeding. When the car matched a vehicle involved in a recent robbery, backup was called in. Lockhart later confessed to robbing an elderly woman the previous week, and to four other robberies.

In the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASpanish%20general%20election%2C%202008"&gt;2008 Spanish general election&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; held on Sunday, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASpanish%20Socialist%20Workers%27%20Party"&gt;Spanish Socialist Workers' Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (PSOE) has emerged as the winner for the second election in a row, edging out the more conservative &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Party%20%28Spain%29"&gt;People's Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in a vote characterized by fears of a faltering economy and militant separatists.

With 93 percent of ballots counted, the Socialists, led by incumbent Prime Minister &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9%20Luis%20Rodr%C3%ADguez%20Zapatero"&gt;José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , had 43.8 percent of the vote, while the People's Party, headed by former Interior Minister &lt;a href="Mariano%20Rajoy"&gt;Mariano Rajoy&lt;/a&gt;, had 40.2 percent. 

The Socialists are projected to win at least 168 of the 350 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, falling short of an absolute majority, which means they may have to rely on the backing of smaller parties to pass important legislation. The People's Party is projected to win at least 154 seats.

"I have called the candidate of the Socialist Party and I have wished him luck for the good of Spain," Rajoy said in his concession speech.
"Thanks to all the citizens who have participated," Zapatero said after his challenger conceded. "And thanks from my heart to the citizens who have, with their votes, given a clear victory to the Socialist Party."

"We have worked hard, and it's been worth the trouble," he added. "I will govern by improving the things we did well and correcting our mistakes," he added.

The economy was a large focus of the election, with the unemployment rate rising and inflation at a 12 year high. To ease concerns about the economy, Zapatero said action would be taken to help construction workers that had been laid off, and he promised a 400 euro ($615) tax cut for all workers. "I will govern for all, but thinking above all of those who don't have it all," Zapatero said.

On March 7, one day prior to the end of the official campaigning period, former Socialist politician &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIsaias%20Carrasco"&gt;Isaias Carrasco&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was shot to death in Spain's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABasque"&gt;Basque&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; region. Zapatero blamed the murder on the &lt;a href="ETA"&gt;ETA&lt;/a&gt;, a Basque separatist organization. "We know that ETA is defeated by democracy and repudiated by the Spanish people together and by Basque Society," said Zapatero. "Its members have no other future than jail."

At Carrasco's funeral Saturday, his daughter called for a massive voter turnout as a way of condemning the ETA. The turnout was estimated to be around 75 percent, close to the record 75.66 percent in the 2004 elections. The newspaper &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEl%20Pa%C3%ADs"&gt;El País&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; commented, "Some are already beginning to put out the idea that a bigger Socialist win than predicted by the opinion polls will be due to the killing of Isaias Carrasco."

The killing drew comparisons to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2004%20Madrid%20train%20bombings"&gt;2004 Madrid train bombings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which killed 191 people three days before the general election in which Zapatero came to power. The conservative government initially placed the blame on the ETA, despite evidence that the attack was done by Islamic extremists angered by Spain's involvement in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20War"&gt;Iraq War&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . One of Zapatero's first acts as Prime Minister was withdrawing troops from Iraq.

During the campaign, Rajoy often criticized his Socialist rival for not doing enough to prevent terrorism and negotiate with the ETA. Zapatero's failed peace talks with the ETA, which ended with the separatists setting off a car bomb at a Madrid airport, became a highly debated issue in the election.

In his 4 years as president, Zapatero's government has enacted social reforms that include legalizing gay marriage, allowing for quicker divorces, and promoting gender equality. These policies conflicted with the views of the &lt;a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church"&gt;Roman Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt;, and in December, Catholics staged a mass protest against the government in Madrid.

The 2008 Tour de Taiwan in &lt;a href="w%3APingtung%20County"&gt;Pingtung County&lt;/a&gt;, started its second stage in the Pingtung Tropic Agriculture Exposition Park (in &lt;a href="w%3AChinese%20language"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt;: 屏東熱博園區) and raced around Pingtung Orchid Fern Bicycle Lane (in &lt;a href="w%3AChinese%20language"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt;: 屏東蘭花蕨自行車道) completing 8 laps today. The cyclists' speed, endurance, and physical strength played the key roles in this stage.

In the intermediate period of this race, Sea Keong Loh, Kenichiro Tose, Peter Morse, and Angus Morton ever successively sprinted for a short-term lead, but the "main group" caught up and made up the difference in just a short distance. Finally, 93 riders in the main group finished this race in 2H21m47s, but &lt;a href="w%3AMarek%20Weso%C5%82y"&gt;Marek Wesoły&lt;/a&gt; reached the finish line first to win the stage champion.

After races in Kaohsiung and Pingtung, &lt;a href="w%3AWong%20Kam-po"&gt;Kam-po Wong&lt;/a&gt; and Po-hung Wu (巫帛宏) held the lead respectively in Asian and Taiwan Group, John Murphy got winning in the overall and sprint class.

<h1>New York governor Spitzer tied to prostitution ring</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=New%20York%20governor%20Spitzer%20tied%20to%20prostitution%20ring&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

According to a report by ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20New%20York%20Times"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ (♡❤The Times♡❤), &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; Governor &lt;a href="Eliot%20Spitzer"&gt;Eliot Spitzer&lt;/a&gt; informed his senior administration officials on Monday that he was being investigated for using a "high-class" prostitution ring. ♡❤The Times♡❤ report cites anonymous officials who work for Spitzer. A law enforcement official who spoke to &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; on condition of anonymity stated that a federal wiretap related to a recent investigation revealed that Spitzer paid for prostitutes from an online service under investigation.

&lt;a href="w%3AABC%20News"&gt;ABC News&lt;/a&gt; reported that, according to federal officials, the federal investigation into the prostitution ring was initially motivated by money transfers which led agents to believe Governor Spitzer was hiding bribes. Sources familiar with the case spoke to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Washington%20Post"&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and &lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;, and said that Spitzer is identified as "Client 9" in court documents and on a federal wiretap. 

In a brief press conference held Monday afternoon, Spitzer apologized to his family and to the public, but did not directly admit or deny involvement in the prostitution ring. "I apologize first and most importantly to my family. I apologize to the public, to whom I promised better. I must now dedicate some time to rededicate my trust to my family," he said, adding that he "acted in a way that violates his obligation to his family."

Spitzer did not answer questions from reporters, indicating he would have more to say "in short order." He did not admit or deny any allegations.

♡❤The Times♡❤♡ report alleges that Gov. Spitzer was a client of the &lt;a href="w%3AEmperors%20Club%20VIP"&gt;Emperors Club VIP&lt;/a&gt;, a high-priced international prostitution ring. Last week, federal investigators arrested four people involved with the operation in and around New York. The investigation utilized undercover work and wiretap recordings at various club locations, including New York and Washington, with the latter allegedly containing Spitzer's voice. 

Reports indicate the governor learned on Friday, March 7, of federal investigators' discovery of his alleged involvement in the prostitution ring. He informed his top aides on Sunday night before meeting with the rest of his staff Monday, according to ♡❤The Times♡❤. Sources for the &lt;a href="w%3AFox%20News%20Channel"&gt;Fox News Channel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AWCBS-TV"&gt;WCBS-TV&lt;/a&gt; in New York report Spitzer could resign and be indicted, in which case the &lt;a href="w%3ALieutenant%20Governor%20of%20New%20York"&gt;Lieutenant Governor of New York&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Paterson"&gt;David Paterson&lt;/a&gt;, would become governor.

&lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Tedisco"&gt;James Tedisco&lt;/a&gt;, the New York State Assembly Republican Minority Leader, says Spitzer should resign and state Republican leadership will initiate impeachment proceedings if the governor fails to step down. "Today's news that Eliot Spitzer was likely involved with a prostitution ring and his refusal to deny it leads to one inescapable conclusion: he has disgraced his office and the entire state of New York. He should resign his office immediately," stated Tedisco.

On Monday, five people were injured after a &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing"&gt;Boeing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20737"&gt;737-400&lt;/a&gt;, operated by &lt;a href="Adam%20Air"&gt;Adam Air&lt;/a&gt;, overshot the runway today while landing at &lt;a href="w%3AHang%20Nadim%20Airport"&gt;Hang Nadim Airport&lt;/a&gt; on the island of &lt;a href="w%3ABatam"&gt;Batam&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;.

The aircraft skidded 75 metres (245 feet) into a grassy field after touching down in rainy conditions. Damage was done to the right wing, hydraulics and main landing gear. The plane came to rest with the nose in the air and leaning towards the right.

Of the 176 passengers (one source says 174) and crew on board, five passengers required treatment for neck and head injuries.

Adam Suherman, president of the airline, said the plane had skidded 10 metres beyond the extreme end of the runway. He also gave the time of the crash as 10:40 and noted that the plane was currently resting on soft ground.

Suherman gave the registration of the aircraft as PK-KKT. This would make the aircraft the one Boeing gave the serial number 24353 and owned by &lt;a href="w%3ACIT%20Group%20Incorporated"&gt;CIT Group Incorporated&lt;/a&gt;.

Adam Air spokesman Danke Drajat described the plane as having been in "good condition" at its last major inspection in December. He suggested the weather condition may be to blame for the crash, the third to strike the budjet carrier in just over a year. On New Year's Day in 2007 &lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20Air%20Flight%20574"&gt;Flight 574&lt;/a&gt; crashed into the sea, leaving 102 missing, presumed dead. The following month the fuselage of &lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20Air%20Flight%20172"&gt;Flight 172&lt;/a&gt; cracked in half during a hard landing. Both involved Boeing 737 aircraft.

Pantun Banjarnahor, Hang Nadim Airport's chief of operations, said that visibility was adequate for a safe landing. The airport was closed for over two hours. It is unclear how many flights were affected.

The National Transportation Safety Committee is investigating.

An Algerian rebel group that has pledged its allegiance to Al-Quada announced on Monday that it had kidnapped two &lt;a href="Austria"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt;ns vacationing in &lt;a href="Tunisia"&gt;Tunisia&lt;/a&gt; on February 22, 2008. 

The statement was read by Salah Abou-Mohammad, a spokesman for the Islamist group which last January announced it was redefining itself as "♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAl-Qaeda%20Organization%20in%20the%20Islamic%20Maghreb"&gt;Al-Qaeda Organization in the Islamic Maghreb&lt;/a&gt;♡❤".

"A squadron of heroic &lt;a href="w%3AMujahideen"&gt;mujahideen&lt;/a&gt; was able to infiltrate deep into the Tunisian state and succeeded in kidnapping two Austrian tourists," Abou-Mohammed said. "The two kidnapped are in good health and are being treated well in keeping with the teachings of Islamic &lt;a href="w%3ASharia"&gt;Sharia&lt;/a&gt;." 

He added, "We tell Western tourists flocking to Tunisia for leisure at a time when our brethren are being slaughtered in Gaza by the Jews with the complicity of Western states ... the apostate Tunisian state is not able, and will not be able, to protect you."

Austrian authorities have confirmed that two of its citizens have been missing since mid-February, but declined to identify them. Reports in local Austrian media say that they are a couple from near &lt;a href="w%3ASalzburg"&gt;Salzburg&lt;/a&gt;: Andrea Kloiber, aged 43, and Wolfgang Ebner, aged 51. Abou-Mohammad identified them by their professions as a nurse and a consultant, respectively.

According to a statement released by the Tunisian government, the pair was last reported heading into the &lt;a href="w%3ASahara"&gt;Sahara&lt;/a&gt; in a direction that could have taken them across the border. 

"Until now there is no element that proves that the two Austrian citizens are in Tunisian territory or that they were kidnapped inside Tunisian borders," it said. However it also said, "The authorities have begun carrying out intensive search operations by land and air."

Tunisia was also the scene of the 2002 &lt;a href="w%3AGhriba%20synagogue%20bombing"&gt;Ghriba synagogue bombing&lt;/a&gt;, for which Al-Qaeda claimed responsibility. That attack left 14 &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germans&lt;/a&gt;, six Tunisians, and one &lt;a href="France"&gt;Frenchman&lt;/a&gt; dead and more than 30 others wounded.

The &lt;a href="w%3AToronto%20Police"&gt;Toronto Police service&lt;/a&gt; have announced the results of a five-week undercover operation against Canadian drug traffickers that ended Monday in the city's &lt;a href="w%3ABloorcourt%20Village"&gt;Bloorcourt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABloordale%20Village"&gt;Bloordale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AParkdale%2C%20Toronto"&gt;Parkdale&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAlexandra%20Park%2C%20Toronto"&gt;Alexandra Park&lt;/a&gt; regions. 

In total, 96 people were arrested, most of whom lived outside the neighbourhoods affected. Nearly half were free on &lt;a href="w%3Aprobation"&gt;probation&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3Abail"&gt;bail&lt;/a&gt; at the time of their arrests, and two men were charged with assaulting a police officer while resisting arrest.

Despite the large number of arrests, police seized only $31,800 worth of &lt;a href="w%3Acocaine"&gt;cocaine&lt;/a&gt;, $800 worth of &lt;a href="w%3Amarijuana"&gt;marijuana&lt;/a&gt; and small amounts of other &lt;a href="w%3AControlled%20substance"&gt;controlled substances&lt;/a&gt;, as well as $10,798 in cash. 

Founded in 2006, the city's Anti-Violence Intervention Strategy teams will be patrolling the neighbourhoods as part of a "follow-up maintenance program" promised by the police force.

Detective Sergeant Ed Roseto, who appealed for help from local residents in the four troubled neighbourhoods, promised that "...we can and will improve the quality of life in these communities," . 

More than a quarter of those arrested were from the &lt;a href="w%3AHomelessness%20in%20Canada"&gt;homeless&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="wikt%3Atransient"&gt;transient&lt;/a&gt; populations of the city.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union"&gt;American Civil Liberties Union&lt;/a&gt; (ACLU) has described President Bush's veto of &lt;a href="w%3ACIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; waterboarding ban as, among other things, "a brazen move signaling a callous disregard for human rights." The executive director of the ACLU, Anthony Romero, said that "it is fundamentally un-American when our president vetoes laws against torture." Romero believes "the president's veto sends a message to the world that despite &lt;a href="w%3ACongress"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt;' actions, our country will continue to engage in this inhumane and heinous conduct when we should be affirming unequivocally and in one voice that torture and abuse will stop and never happen again. No one is above the rule of law, including the president. Congress should hold firm and persist in trying to get an anti-torture bill signed into law."

&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt;'s support of the bill was also mentioned with Caroline Fredrickson saying that "Senator McCain has been the leading voice in Congress on the issue of torture for many years. He led the charge in 2005 to extend the Army Field Manual to all &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense"&gt;DoD&lt;/a&gt; agencies. But by voting 'no' last month, he has given President Bush cover to veto a further extension that would rein in the CIA. The president cannot continue telling our citizens and the world that the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; does not torture when, at the same time, he vetoes legislation that would outlaw such policies. America needs Congress to continue sending President Bush anti-torture legislation until he complies with the will of the people and the Congress and signs it in to law."

The bill, which passed the &lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; in November and the Senate in February despite warnings that it would be vetoed, established guidelines for intelligence activities. One of these guidelines would limit the CIA to only using interrogation methods allowed in the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Army%20Field%20Manual"&gt;U.S. Army Field Manual&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Endeavour"&gt;Space Shuttle ♡❤Endeavour♡❤&lt;/a&gt; successfully launched this morning from &lt;a href="w%3AKennedy%20Space%20Center%20Launch%20Complex%2039"&gt;Launch Complex 39A&lt;/a&gt; at the , on mission &lt;a href="w%3ASTS-123"&gt;STS-123&lt;/a&gt; to assemble the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Space%20Station"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt; (ISS). Lift-off occurred at 06:28:14 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt; (02:28 local time). On board was a crew of seven &lt;a href="w%3Aastronaut"&gt;astronaut&lt;/a&gt;s; Mission Commander &lt;a href="w%3ADominic%20L.%20Pudwill%20Gorie"&gt;Dominic Gorie&lt;/a&gt;, Pilot &lt;a href="w%3AGregory%20H.%20Johnson"&gt;Gregory Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20L.%20Behnken"&gt;Robert Behnken&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Foreman"&gt;Michael Foreman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20M.%20Linnehan"&gt;Richard Linnehan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATakao%20Doi"&gt;Takao Doi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGarrett%20Reisman"&gt;Garrett Reisman&lt;/a&gt;. 

All except Reisman will return to Earth aboard ♡❤Endeavour♡❤ in two week's time. Reisman, a member of the ISS &lt;a href="w%3AExpedition%2016"&gt;Expedition 16&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AExpedition%2017"&gt;17&lt;/a&gt; crews, will remain aboard the Space Station, replacing &lt;a href="w%3AL%C3%A9opold%20Eyharts"&gt;Léopold Eyharts&lt;/a&gt; who launched aboard &lt;a href="w%3ASTS-122"&gt;STS-122&lt;/a&gt; last month.

During the 16-day &lt;a href="w%3ASTS-123"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt; - the longest Shuttle flight in support of the ISS - the crew will install two major ISS components. the &lt;a href="w%3AJapanese%20Experiment%20Module"&gt;♡❤Kibō♡❤ Pressurised Logistics Module&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASpecial%20Purpose%20Dexterous%20Manipulator"&gt;Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator&lt;/a&gt; (SPDM). The ♡❤Kibō♡❤ Pressurised Logistics Module is the first of three components which will form the &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;ese &lt;a href="w%3AJapanese%20Experiment%20Module"&gt;Experiment Module&lt;/a&gt; (JEM). It will be temporarily installed on a spare docking port of the &lt;a href="w%3AHarmony%20module"&gt;Harmony module&lt;/a&gt; of the Station, and will later be fitted to the main pressurised experiment module, which is slated for launch aboard &lt;a href="w%3ASTS-124"&gt;STS-124&lt;/a&gt;, to be flown by &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Discovery"&gt;♡❤Discovery♡❤&lt;/a&gt; in late May. 

SPDM, also known as Dextre, is a twin robotic arm system, or Remote Manipulator System (RMS), which will be installed on the end of the Space Station's &lt;a href="w%3ACanadarm2"&gt;Canadarm2&lt;/a&gt; robotic arm. It will allow complex tasks to be completed without the need for a spacewalk.
Five &lt;a href="w%3Aextra-vehicular%20activity"&gt;extra-vehicular activities&lt;/a&gt; are planned for the mission. The first three of these will be to assemble, install and test the Dextre SPDM. This will be followed by an EVA to test new tile repair techniques in the event of a Shuttle becoming damaged on a later mission. This test comes ahead of the planned &lt;a href="w%3ASTS-125"&gt;STS-125&lt;/a&gt; mission to service the &lt;a href="w%3AHubble%20Space%20Telescope"&gt;Hubble Space Telescope&lt;/a&gt; in August. The final EVA will be to stow the &lt;a href="w%3AOrbiter%20Boom%20Sensor%20System"&gt;Orbiter Boom Sensor System&lt;/a&gt; (OBSS) on the Space Station. 

This usually remains on the Shuttle for launch and landing, however as the next mission, STS-124, is carrying a very large payload - the JEM pressurised experiment module - the OBSS cannot be accommodated in its payload bay for launch. Because it will be needed once the Shuttle reaches orbit, ♡❤Discovery♡❤ will collect the OBSS from the ISS, and return it to Earth at the end of its mission. The OBSS is used to conduct photography of the orbiter's heat shield, in order to check for damage, similar to that which caused the &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Columbia%20disaster"&gt;♡❤Columbia♡❤ accident&lt;/a&gt;.

Two minor problems occurred during the launch. Firstly, the primary Flash Evaporator System failed, resulting in a switch to the backup system, which performed normally. The Flash Evaporator System is used to cool the Shuttle prior to the deployment of its radiators. The radiators were deployed normally following payload bay door opening, once the Shuttle was in orbit. The other issue was that instrumentation failed for a small number of Reaction Control System (RCS) thrusters, which are used to control the Shuttles attitude. 

Neither problem is expected to affect the mission. The ascent to orbit has been initially assessed as "clean" in terms of debris impacts, the only concern is a suspected birdstrike ten seconds after launch, however it is believed that ♡❤Endeavour♡❤ was not travelling fast enough to sustain damage.

This is the 122 launch of the Space Shuttle, the 21 of ♡❤Endeavour♡❤, and the 25 Shuttle mission to the ISS. It also marks the ninth, and second manned, orbital launch of &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20in%20spaceflight"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;. Launch occurred at night, making this the Shuttle's 30 night launch. This flight was originally scheduled to launch on February 14th, but after the previous mission, &lt;a href="w%3ASTS-122"&gt;STS-122&lt;/a&gt;, was delayed due to bad sensors inside the external fuel tank, STS-123 was pushed back to no earlier than March 11.

The 3rd Stage of 2008 Tour de Taiwan was held today in &lt;a href="w%3AChanghua%20County"&gt;Changhua County&lt;/a&gt; - the long-distance circulation. This race started at Baguashan, along County Route 19 through two townships including Tienwei and Yuanlin, and finally entered the climbing stage near the Arch of Baguashan. The route challenged cyclists' speed in the climbing stage, and many consider the Changhua County part of the race, the hardest of the tournament. 
In this race, Tomoya Kano and Shinichi Fukushima sprinted for the leading advantage with four other cyclists, but after entering the downtown route, Angus Morton suddenly crashed when downgrading. This sudden crash reduced the differences within the six cyclists leading the group before the climbing stage. Finally, Peter McDonald from Drapac Porsche Development Program Team accidentally won the stage champion with his teammates' help.

With the advantages of steady weather and the climbing stage, Giant Asia Racing Team group took the lead, and Kuan-hua Lai from Giant Asia led in Taiwan Group during this stage. John Murphy from &lt;a href="w%3AHealth%20Net%20Pro%20Cycling%20Team"&gt;Health Net Pro Cycling Team&lt;/a&gt; still retained the liead in overall and sprint classes.

The Tour de Taiwan is a professional road bicycle racing event on the UCI Asia Tour. The event was established by Giant Sport Foundation founder King Liu in 1978. Last year's winner was Shawn Milne representing the United States.

<h1>Adam Air may be shut down after string of accidents</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Adam%20Air%20may%20be%20shut%20down%20after%20string%20of%20accidents&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;n budget carrier &lt;a href="Adam%20Air"&gt;Adam Air&lt;/a&gt; has been warned by Indonesia's transport minister that unless the airline improves safety it will be shut down. Adam Air has suffered a string of recent accidents.

"We are giving them a chance to improve. If there's no change, we will place them in the third category," said Transport Minister Jusman Syafii Djamal, according to the state's ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAntara"&gt;Antara&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ news agency. The third category refers to the lowest a three-category ratings system for airline safety introduced last year. Airlines in the third category will be shut down in three months unless improvements occur. Adam Air is in the second category, which means that although the airline meets minimum requirements some problems still remain. "We give an early warning to make the carrier improve its safety," Djamal told reporters.

The announcement follows the news yesterday that an Adam Air &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing"&gt;Boeing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20737"&gt;737-400&lt;/a&gt; had overshot the runway at &lt;a href="w%3ABatam"&gt;Batam&lt;/a&gt; island's airport, injuring five of the over 170 people on board. It is the third serious accident in just over a year. On New Year's Day 2007 &lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20Air%20Flight%20574"&gt;Adam Air Flight 574&lt;/a&gt; crashed into the ocean near &lt;a href="w%3ASulawesi"&gt;Sulawesi&lt;/a&gt;, leaving 102 missing, presumed dead. The following month &lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20Air%20Flight%20172"&gt;Flight 172&lt;/a&gt; cracked in half after a hard landing but held together, preventing fatalities. Both aircraft were Boeing 737s.

Danke Drajat, spokesman for Adam Air, said that the airline was making efforts to comply with the demand. "We are completing all manuals and revamping the standard operating procedure," he said.

The Adam Air accidents accounted for two of the three main accidents that caused the to ban Indonesian airlines from EU airspace last year over safety standards. The other, &lt;a href="w%3AGaruda%20Indonesia"&gt;Garuda Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGaruda%20Indonesia%20Flight%20200"&gt;Flight 200&lt;/a&gt;, involved a 737 belonging to the state owned &lt;a href="w%3Aflag%20carrier"&gt;flag carrier&lt;/a&gt; speeding off a runway at &lt;a href="w%3AYogyakarta"&gt;Yogyakarta&lt;/a&gt; during an attempted landing; 21 people were killed.

<h1>Cassini spacecraft collects sample from geyser on Saturn's moon Enceladus</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Cassini%20spacecraft%20collects%20sample%20from%20geyser%20on%20Saturn%27s%20moon%20Enceladus&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
Space probe &lt;a href="w%3ACassini%E2%80%93Huygens"&gt;Cassini&lt;/a&gt; performed a close flyby of &lt;a href="w%3ASaturn"&gt;Saturn&lt;/a&gt;'s icy moon &lt;a href="w%3AEnceladus%20%28moon%29"&gt;Enceladus&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday. The fate of the $3.5 billion mission was in the balance as the bus-sized spacecraft swooped to just 50 km (30 mi) above the surface of Enceladus to sample the frozen spray issuing from &lt;a href="w%3Ageysers"&gt;geysers&lt;/a&gt; on the moon's surface. The "water" spraying from these geysers is in the form of dust-sized, frozen water particles, which are ejected into space by gaseous water vapors that build up pressure deep within icy fissures on Enceladus. 

Cassini's cosmic dust analyzer was unavailable due to a glitch in the updated software that was supposed to provide an increased hit count of the geyser dust particles. However, dust samples were collected before and after the closest approach and the mass spectrometer functioned throughout the flyby, providing useful data which is now being analyzed. 

Mission controllers will have a chance to capture more geyser dust on October 9, 2008 when they may choose to steer Cassini even closer to the surface of Enceladus. 
&lt;a href="w%3ATidal%20flexing"&gt;Tidal flexing&lt;/a&gt; of this moon due to the gravitational proximity of its host planet, Saturn, continually heaves and cracks the icy surface. This suggests that Enceladus may have a squishy, liquid-water ocean beneath an icy crust. Deep, parallel fissures in the ice crust, dubbed the "Tiger Stripes", measure warmer than uncracked, stationary surfaces nearby. Friction of these massive, moving plates of ice is thought to provide the heat responsible for the pressurized geysers of sublimated water and ice dust. The presence of these geysers amounts to more empirical evidence of a large, liquid water ocean below the surface of Enceladus.

The Cassini-Huygens space probe is an international mission involving the cooperative efforts of &lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Space%20Agency"&gt;European Space Agency&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="w%3AItalian%20Space%20Agency"&gt;Italian Space Agency&lt;/a&gt;. Launched in 1997, Cassini has orbited Saturn since 2004 but has never before flown so close to a moon. On 14 January 2005, the &lt;a href="w%3AHuygens%20probe"&gt;Huygens lander&lt;/a&gt; successfully explored the atmosphere and surface conditions of Saturn's biggest moon, &lt;a href="w%3ATitan"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;.

There were 3 games played in the National Hockey League on March 10, 2008.

<h2>Game summaries</h2>
<h3>New York Rangers @ Buffalo Sabres</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3AJason%20Pominville"&gt;Jason Pominville&lt;/a&gt; scored the first goal for the Sabres, putting them up 1-0 just 16 seconds into the game. Just over a minute later, the Rangers tied up the score when &lt;a href="w%3AFedor%20Tyutin"&gt;Fedor Tyutin&lt;/a&gt; scored. In the second period, the Rangers took the lead when &lt;a href="w%3AJaromir%20Jagr"&gt;Jaromir Jagr&lt;/a&gt; scored his 18th of the season, his 639th of his career. &lt;a href="w%3AThomas%20Vanek"&gt;Thomas Vanek&lt;/a&gt; tied the score with a power play goal 14:14 into the second period. The game remained a 2-2 tie through regulation. In the shootout, &lt;a href="w%3ABrendan%20Shanahan"&gt;Brendan Shanahan&lt;/a&gt; scored in the first round. Pominville managed to tie the shootout at 1-1 in the third round, but &lt;a href="w%3AScott%20Gomez"&gt;Scott Gomez&lt;/a&gt;, who went second in round 3, scored on &lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Miller%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;Ryan Miller&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AHenrik%20Lundqvist"&gt;Henrik Lundqvist&lt;/a&gt; picked up his third straight win after making 19 saves on 21 Sabres shots.
<h3>St. Louis Blues @ Calgary Flames</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3AAlex%20Tanguay"&gt;Alex Tanguay&lt;/a&gt; scored the first goal for the Flames 21 seconds into the first period. &lt;a href="w%3AKristian%20Huselius"&gt;Kristian Huselius&lt;/a&gt; scored his 22nd goal of the season 7:13 into the game. Less than two minutes later, St. Louis cut Calgary's lead in half when &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Backes%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;David Backes&lt;/a&gt; scored. Calgary retook a 2 goal lead when &lt;a href="w%3AJarome%20Iginla"&gt;Jarome Iginla&lt;/a&gt; scored his 41st goal of the season. &lt;a href="w%3ABrad%20Boyes"&gt;Brad Boyes&lt;/a&gt;' goal in the second period kept the Blues within one goal. &lt;a href="w%3AMatthew%20Lombardi"&gt;Matthew Lombardi&lt;/a&gt; scored a short handed goal a few minutes later for Calgary. &lt;a href="w%3AMarcus%20Nilson"&gt;Marcus Nilson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ADaymond%20Langkow"&gt;Daymond Langkow&lt;/a&gt; scored a goal each just over a minute apart in the third period. Boyes scored his second goal of the night for St. Louis with less than 10 minutes remaining in the game. Tanguay, who started the offense for Calgary in the first period, scored a short handed empty net goal, putting the Flames ahead by 4, where they would stay through the rest of the game. Iginla's goal, his 365th in his career surpasses &lt;a href="w%3ATheo%20Fleury"&gt;Theo Fleury&lt;/a&gt; for the all-time leading goal scorer in Calgary Flames franchise history. In addition, the Flames pull ahead of the Minnesota Wild in the Northwest division standings. The Blues have now lost 3 straight, and 9 of their last 10 games.
<h3>Vancouver Canucks @ Los Angeles Kings</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20O%27Sullivan%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;Patrick O'Sullivan&lt;/a&gt; broke the scoreless tie 8:27 into the third period. &lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Kesler"&gt;Ryan Kesler&lt;/a&gt; tied it up with 2:41 left in regulation, which sent the game into overtime. Kesler tipped &lt;a href="w%3AWillie%20Mitchell%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;Willie Mitchell&lt;/a&gt;'s slapshot into the goal just 46 seconds into the 4-on-4 overtime, giving Kesler his second goal of the night, and the Canucks their third win in a row. &lt;a href="w%3ADan%20Cloutier"&gt;Dan Cloutier&lt;/a&gt; made 38 saves on the night. &lt;a href="w%3ARoberto%20Luongo"&gt;Roberto Luongo&lt;/a&gt; had an easier night between the pipes for Vancouver, seeing only 18 shots throughout the game, and stopping all but one of them.
<h2>Player of the Day</h2>

Today's Player of the Day is Ryan Kesler of the Vancouver Canucks. Kesler scored the game-tying goal to force overtime with less than 3 minutes left in regulation, and deflected in the game winning goal less than a minute into overtime.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Rudd"&gt;Kevin Rudd&lt;/a&gt; faced intense scrutiny in federal parliament on Tuesday following days of speculation that he was considering scrapping cash bonuses to recipients of carer and seniors payments. Questions by the opposition during &lt;a href="w%3AQuestion%20time"&gt;question time&lt;/a&gt; were dominated by the cash bonuses, with leader of the opposition, &lt;a href="w%3ABrendan%20Nelson"&gt;Brendan Nelson&lt;/a&gt; moving to &lt;a href="w%3ACensure"&gt;censure&lt;/a&gt; the Prime Minister.

It was the first censure motion moved against the Prime Minister since his election last year.

For the past four years, the previous &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;Howard&lt;/a&gt; government had made one-off payments to seniors of up to $500 and $1,600 to carers.

Facing repeated questions, the Prime Minister said "I guarantee that carers will not be one
dollar worse off as a consequence of the budget".

Mr Rudd said that the government was also looking at "the challenges of carers and pensioners in the long term" instead of through one-time bonus payments as the previous government had. Mr Rudd then called the opposition the "new party of compassion" and told the house that the Howard government had never committed to the payments in the long term, as they were not in forward budget estimates.

Brendan Nelson then moved a motion to censure the Prime Minister over his plans. During his motion, Dr Nelson called upon the Prime Minister to "get up, for God’s sake, get up, stand in front of that microphone and say to the carers of this country, ‘I, the Prime Minister of Australia, believe in you and will deliver you a lump sum payment in the budget."

Dr Nelson also accused the Prime Minister of not seeing the significance of the bonus payments for those who receive them. "For someone earning $250,000 a year, a lump sum payment of $1,600 would probably
make them think: ‘What’s that? It’s my credit card payment or whatever.’" said Dr Nelson.

The opposition leader told the House of Representatives that many people had been budgeting for the bonus payment and it was unfair for it to be taken from them. "If you are hanging out for that lump sum payment, it is absolutely essential for your budgeting," said Dr Nelson.

When the Prime Minister spoke against the motion, he reminded the opposition that a &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Austraia"&gt;Liberal party&lt;/a&gt; document said "A re-elected Coalition Government will consider continuing
to pay these bonuses, depending on the economic circumstances at the time."

Mr Rudd then drew attention to his $500 utilities allowance, which will be paid to aged and disability pensioners as well as carers to counter the rise in the cost of living.

Speaking for the motion, opposition community services spokesman &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Abbott"&gt;Tony Abbott&lt;/a&gt; accused the Rudd government of "compassion fatigue" and said that the cardboard cutout of the Prime Minister which appeared in parliament on the previous sitting day had "more heart than this Prime Minister".

The censure motion was defeated along party lines.

Former &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; has criticised the &lt;a href="Kevin%20Rudd"&gt;Rudd&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian_Labor_Party"&gt;Labor&lt;/a&gt; government for apologising to the &lt;a href="w%3AStolen%20Generations"&gt;Stolen Generations&lt;/a&gt; in parliament last month. Mr Howard was prime minister before the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20General%20Election%2C%202007"&gt;election&lt;/a&gt; last year.

Mr Howard's successor, opposition leader and leader of the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;Liberal party&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABrendan%20Nelson"&gt;Brendan Nelson&lt;/a&gt; supported the apology, making a speech of his own in parliament. The apology was unanimously supported by the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;.

While speaking to students at the &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20F.%20Kennedy%20School%20of%20Government"&gt;John F. Kennedy School of Government&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3AHarvard%20University"&gt;Harvard&lt;/a&gt;, the former Prime Minister defended his decision not to apologise to indigenous Australians during his 11 years in office.

"I do not believe, as a matter of principle, that one generation can accept responsibility for the acts of an earlier generation. I don't accept that as a matter of principle," Mr Howard said.

"In some cases, children were wrongly removed; in other cases, they were removed for good reason; in other cases, they were given up; and in other cases, the judgment on the removal is obscure or difficult to make."

Mr Howard said the apology was dangerous as it led many to believe that the government had "ticked the box" on indigenous issues in Australia. "The third reason I wasn't in favour of it was that it seems to me that there is a real danger that when we do something like that, there's a psychological reaction of the indigenous box has been ticked, and we've solved the problem,"

"The commitment to do practical things such as reducing the gap between the life expectancy of indigenous Australians and other Australians, which is unacceptably high, is pushed into the background," the former PM told listeners.

Mr Howard said there had been a failure over the past few decades to address indigenous affairs. "I think we persevered for too long with the notion of separate development. I think the only way the indigenous people of Australia can get what we call a fair go is for them to become part of the mainstream of the community and get the benefits and opportunities available from mainstream Australian society, whilst recognising … the particular and special place of the indigenous culture in the life of the country," said Mr Howard.

Mr Howard rejected suggestions from a member of the audience that his refusal to apologise to indigenous Australians and refusing to sign the &lt;a href="w%3AKyoto%20Protocol"&gt;Kyoto Protocol&lt;/a&gt; lost his government the election. "The first lesson I learned is you win some, you lose some,"

"I did have the opportunity of winning four elections," said Mr Howard.

&lt;a href="w%3AJayant%20Patel"&gt;Jayant Patel&lt;/a&gt;, wanted for manslaughter, grievous bodily harm and fraud in &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, was arrested by &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; agents in &lt;a href="Oregon"&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and is scheduled to face an extradition hearing on April 10.

According to an affidavit filed by US prosecutors, Patel, previously restricted from performing surgery in the US due to "professional misconduct", lied about his professional history in order to work at &lt;a href="w%3ABundaberg%20Base%20Hospital"&gt;Bundaberg Base Hospital&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ABundaberg%2C%20Queensland"&gt;Bundaberg, Queensland&lt;/a&gt;.

Patel performed surgeries at Bundaberg that are alleged to have directly led to the deaths of several of his patients, including one procedure which he had previously been banned from performing in Oregon. The incidents led to Patel being nicknamed "Dr Death".

If successfully extradited to Australia, Patel "will get a fair trial", according to the Federal Member for &lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Hinkler"&gt;Hinkler&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Neville%20%28politician%29"&gt;Paul Neville&lt;/a&gt;, whose electorate includes Bundaberg, although the extradition may take some time due to Patel's US citizenship.

&lt;a href="Wikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; founder &lt;a href="Jimmy%20Wales"&gt;Jimmy Wales&lt;/a&gt; has been accused of editing pages in the encyclopedia in return for a donation to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWikimedia%20Foundation"&gt;Wikimedia Foundation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . In an article published Tuesday, the ♡❤&lt;a href="Sydney%20Morning%20Herald"&gt;Sydney Morning Herald&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reported that former &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANovell"&gt;Novell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; computer scientist &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJeff%20V.%20Merkey"&gt;Jeff Merkey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; alleged Wales had made edits to his article on his behalf, in exchange for a donation to the Wikimedia Foundation. The news hit the website &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASlashdot"&gt;Slashdot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; later Tuesday, where the incident was dubbed "DonorGate".

According to ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Daily%20Telegraph"&gt;The Daily Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤, Merkey claims that he was told by Wales in 2006 that the Wikipedia article about him could be made more favorable in exchange for a donation. Merkey made a donation of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUSD"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 5,000 to the Wikimedia Foundation, and Wales made edits to the Wikipedia article about Merkey around the same time. Merkey published his claims on a public Wikimedia mailing list and sent a statement to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Associated%20Press"&gt;The Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .
In a response Wales called Merkey's statements "nonsense", saying "Of course I would never offer, nor accept any offer, whereby a donation would buy someone special editorial treatment in the encyclopedia. I do routinely assist people with WP:BLP issues, and I do courtesies for many people. Donations have no bearing on that at all." &lt;span class="interwiki-link-forced-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWP%3ABLP"&gt;WP:BLP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; refers to Wikipedia's policy regarding biographies of living persons on the encyclopedia. 

After deleting the Wikipedia article about Merkey in 2006, Wales wrote to Wikipedia editors he had done so "because of the unpleasantness of it" and requested that they "be extra careful here to be courteous and assume good faith". After erasing the article, Wales placed the article under protection with editing access limited to established users. Merkey ceased his $5,000.00 per year payments to the Wikimedia Foundation after reviewing what he called "evidence of diversion and mismanagement of the charities funds by Wales and the Wikimedia Board of Trustees".
In a statement responding to a post about the incident on the site Techtree.com, Wikimedia Foundation's Head of Communications &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJay%20Walsh"&gt;Jay Walsh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; addressed the Foundation's principles regarding &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aconflict%20of%20interest"&gt;conflict of interest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; : "The Wikimedia Foundation (the Foundation which operates and maintains Wikipedia and other free knowledge projects) has never solicited or accepted donations for the purposes of making edits or offering protection to Wikipedia articles. Nor has Jimmy Wales ever solicited or accepted donations for the Foundation in this capacity. These allegations are completely false. ... Jimmy has been unfailingly ethical and frugal in the use of all Foundation funds. The Wikimedia Foundation, its staff and board members, and the users of Wikipedia itself hold the core principles of 'no conflict of interest' in the highest regard."

After leaving Novell amidst allegations of misappropriation of trade secrets, Merkey was sued by his former employer. He filed a harassment lawsuit against organizations including the website Slashdot in 2005. Merkey filed a suit against &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADelta%20Air%20Lines"&gt;Delta Air Lines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANatural%20Selection%20Foods"&gt;Natural Selection Foods&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 2006, claiming his son had become sick from E. coli contaminated spinach. 

Merkey is banned from editing Wikipedia due to a ruling by Wikipedia's Arbitration Committee. 
♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-forced-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia%3AWikipedia%20Signpost/About"&gt;The Wikipedia Signpost&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤, Wikipedia's community-written and community-edited newspaper, reported that a Wikipedia user account used by Merkey was blocked in October 2005 for "Personal attacks, legal threats, harassment, disruption". Merkey was later allowed to come back to edit Wikipedia in May 2007 under a different account. As the result of a ruling by Wikipedia's Arbitration Committe in a July 2007 arbitration case, Merkey and two users who had harassed him on Wikipedia were banned from editing the encyclopedia for one year.

Last week Jimmy Wales faced accusations by former Wikimedia Foundation executive Danny Wool that he misused the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Anon-profit%20organization"&gt;non-profit organization&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's funds, and attempted to expense a visit to a Moscow massage parlor and high-priced bottles of wine. In an interview with ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACNET%20TV"&gt;CNET TV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤, Wikimedia Foundation Executive Director &lt;a href="Sue%20Gardner"&gt;Sue Gardner&lt;/a&gt; described Wool as "a disgruntled former employee" and called his claims "a whole bunch of unsubstantiated rumors and gossip". Wales's former girlfriend, journalist &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARachel%20Marsden"&gt;Rachel Marsden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , recently leaked purported instant message transcripts with Wales, which implied Wales had used his influence to change the article about Marsden on Wikipedia. Wales ended his relationship with Marsden and made a public statement to that effect on Wikipedia, and in response Marsden opened an auction for some of Wales's clothing on &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AeBay"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; Governor &lt;a href="w%3AEliot%20Spitzer"&gt;Eliot Spitzer&lt;/a&gt; has announced that he has resigned, effective Monday. Spitzer was recently discovered to have been a client of a prostitution ring on numerous occasions.

In a press conference, Governor Spitzer said: "I am deeply sorry that I did not live up to what was expected of me. To every New Yorker, and to all those who believed in what I tried to stand for, I sincerely apologize. I will try once again outside of politics to serve the common good."

Public opinion polls in recent days have shown that 68% of New Yorkers wanted Spitzer to resign and many politicians had also called for his resignation.

As a result Spitzer will be succeeded by Lieutenant Governor &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Paterson"&gt;David Paterson&lt;/a&gt;, who will become New York's first &lt;a href="w%3AAfrican%20American"&gt;African American&lt;/a&gt; governor. It is believed he will be the first legally blind governor in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.

Spitzer remains a &lt;a href="w%3Asuperdelegate"&gt;superdelegate&lt;/a&gt; for Senator &lt;a href="w%3AHillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt;'s presidential campaign until he officially steps down as governor.

The body of a man was discovered on a street in &lt;a href="w%3ALancaster%2C%20California"&gt;Lancaster&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; around 1:45 a.m &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Time%20Zone"&gt;PDT&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC-7"&gt;UTC-7&lt;/a&gt;) Tuesday morning with an arrow stuck deep into his chest. Sheriff's deputies who responded to the crime scene at 13th Street and Avenue K initially thought the victim to have been homeless, but he was later identified as Angel Martinez, age 62, who resided in Lancaster.

"Who would want to do something like that to an elderly person?" said Tony Martinez, a local resident who was among those who found the victim. "And what was an elderly man doing out here anyway that late?"

The attacker, who struck by night, is being sought by authorities.

The &lt;a href="w%3ATaichung%20City"&gt;Taichung City&lt;/a&gt; Stage of Tour de Taiwan 2008, approved by several executives since the first time set up in the &lt;a href="w%3ATaichung%20Intercontinental%20Baseball%20Stadium"&gt;Taichung Intercontinental Baseball Stadium&lt;/a&gt; last year, raced today around the Wen-shin Forest Park near Shiang-shang Road, Wen-shin Road, Da-duen 7th Street, and He-nan Road Sec. 4.

It's a short-term circulation, however. But due to a few differences on land ranges, not every cyclist can keep the leading in a long-period. Finally, the "main group" with 90 participated cyclists passed the finish line, but &lt;a href="w%3Apl%3AKrzysztof%20Je%C5%BCowski%20%28kolarz%29"&gt;Krzysztof Jeżowski&lt;/a&gt; from Merida Europe narrowly touched the finish line first to win the stage champion.

After the race, ♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ Reporter briefly questioned Jeżowski about next 4 stages in Tour de Taiwan, he commented that he and his teammate will do several attempts to win the stage champions in next 4 stages to repay on anticipations by some cycling fans.

The &lt;a href="w%3AService%20Employees%20International%20Union"&gt;Service Employees International Union&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3Atrade%20union"&gt;trade union&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, was trying to unionize 8,300 workers in nine different &lt;a href="Ohio"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt; hospitals through elections that were scheduled for this Wednesday and Friday. But then organizers from a second union, the California Nurses Association, visited the hospitals to encourage the workers to vote not to join the S.E.I.U. These actions led to the service employees union on Tuesday asking to postpone the vote by workers at the nine hospitals, all which are a part of the Catholic Healthcare Partners system.

Andy Stern, the service president is quoted as saying, "nothing more than a flimsy cover for out-and-out &lt;a href="w%3Aunion%20busting"&gt;union busting&lt;/a&gt; that we normally see from employers, not organizations that claim to care about workers."

The &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%20Nurses%20Association"&gt;California Nurses Association&lt;/a&gt;, said it dispatched organizers to Ohio because in its view the unionization efforts were part of a "sweetheart deal".

Rose Ann DeMoro, executive director of the nurses association, condemned this agreement. She called it "a rigged scam" in which the service union would bargain without care if they won the vote.

"This was a top-down deal between an employer and a hand-picked union," Ms. DeMoro said. "There was a gag order on everyone, and as a result this was a banana republic election." 

"As for the future," DeMoro said, "no election is planned." She said that delaying the election was "a significant victory for employee rights."

Dave Regan, president of a service employees’ local representing 35,000 health care workers in Ohio, &lt;a href="West%20Virginia"&gt;West Virginia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Kentucky"&gt;Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;, called the nurses union’s conduct as, "Their conduct is indistinguishable from that of the most vicious anti-union employers," Mr. Regan said. "It violates every principle of unionism. Real people are worse off today as a result of their behavior."

Orest Holubec, spokesman for Catholic Healthcare, said the system’s hospital in Lima had obtained a restraining order to bar the &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; nurses from entering restricted patient-care areas and aggressive leafletting outside hospitals. "They were doing exactly the kind of things we were trying to avoid," Mr. Holubec said. "They poisoned the well to the degree that we didn’t have the conditions that we tried to establish for a pressure-free environment."

<h1>Australian health workers to close intensive care units in Victoria next week</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Australian%20health%20workers%20to%20close%20intensive%20care%20units%20in%20Victoria%20next%20week&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
Members of &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AHealth%20Services%20Union"&gt;Health Services Union&lt;/a&gt; (HSU) will go on strike in &lt;a href="Victoria%2C%20Australia"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt; next week in a dispute over stalled wage and career structure negotiations. Over 5000 physiotherapists, speech pathologists and radiation therapists will walk off the job next week, effectively closing the state's 68 largest health services.

The strike will force the closure of intensive care units and emergency departments across the state.

It is feared the strike could continue into &lt;a href="w%3AEaster"&gt;Easter&lt;/a&gt;.

National secretary of the HSU, Kathy Jackson said admissions would be crippled, while intensive care patients would have to be evacuated to &lt;a href="New%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Tasmania"&gt;Tasmania&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="South%20Australia"&gt;South Australia&lt;/a&gt; as hospitals will not be able to perform tests or administer treatment.

"When an ambulance shows up you can't admit a patient without an X-ray being available, you can't intubate them and you can't operate on them," she said. 

"If something goes wrong in an ICU you need to be able to X-ray, use nuclear medicine or any diagnostic procedure," said Ms Jackson.

Ms Jackson said the HSU offered arbitration last year, but the state government refused. "They're not interested in settling disputes, they hope that we are just going to go away."

"We're not going away, we've gone back and balloted the whole public health workforce in Victoria, those ballots were successful, 97 percent approval rating," she said.

The HSU is urging the government to commence serious negotiations to resolve the dispute before industrial action commenced.

The government has offered the union a 3.25 per cent pay increase, in line with other public sector workers but the union has demanded more, but stopped short of specifying a figure.

Victorian &lt;a href="w%3APremier%20of%20Victoria"&gt;Premier&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Brumby"&gt;John Brumby&lt;/a&gt; said the claim would be settled according to the government's wages policy. "The Government is always willing and wanting to sit down and negotiate with the relevant organisations . . . we have a wages policy based around an increase of 3.25 per cent and, above that, productivity offset," he told parliament.

The union claims it is also arguing against a lack of career structure, which has caused many professionals to leave the health service. Ms Jackson said wages and career structures in Victoria were behind other states.

Victorian Opposition Leader &lt;a href="w%3ATed%20Baillieu"&gt;Ted Baillieu&lt;/a&gt; said he was not in support of the proposed strike and called on the government to meet with unions. "There could not be a more serious threat to our health system than has been announced today." 

"We now have to do whatever is possible to stop this strike from proceeding," he said.

The opposition leader will meet with the union at 11:30 AM today.

Victorian Hospitals Industry Association industrial relations services manager Simon Chant said hospitals were looking at the possible impact and warned that patients may have to be evacuated interstate if the strike goes ahead.

Dr. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJack%20Kevorkian"&gt;Jack Kevorkian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a prominent &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; advocate for the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aright-to-die"&gt;right-to-die&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for terminally ill patients via &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aphysician-assisted%20suicide"&gt;physician-assisted suicide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , stated on Wednesday that he intends to run for a seat in the &lt;a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;United States House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;.

"We need some honesty and sincerity instead of corrupt government in Washington," Dr. Kevorkian said while announcing his bid to represent &lt;a href="Michigan"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMichigan%27s%209th%20congressional%20district"&gt;9th congressional district&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . He said more information about his candidacy would be forthcoming next week, but he will run without party affiliation.

This seat is currently held by Congressman &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Knollenberg"&gt;Joe Knollenberg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a &lt;a href="United%20States%20Republican%20Party"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; who has been the incumbent since 1993. &lt;a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Democrat&lt;/a&gt; and former &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMichigan%20Senate"&gt;state senator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGary%20Peters%20%28Michigan%20politician%29"&gt;Gary Peters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is also contesting the seat.

Kevorkian told ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Oakland%20Press"&gt;The Oakland Press&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APontiac%2C%20Michigan"&gt;Pontiac&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which broke the story, that his campaign was in a "formative stage". In order to be on the ballot, Kevorkian will need to collect 3,000 signatures by the middle of July.

"That will be very easy for Jack," said Ruth Holmes, a long-standing associate of Kevorkian. "Jack is in great spirits, and he intends to do this. He just hopes for some honesty in government," she said.

Mike Brownfield, the campaign manager for Knollenberg said it "doesn't affect Joe Knollenberg at all. He's going to keep getting things done for Oakland County's families."

Julie Petrick, spokesperson for the Peters campaign, said "anybody has the right to run" but this is "one of the top races in the country as far as viability and our ability to win here."

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOakland%20County%2C%20Michigan"&gt;Oakland County&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; prosecutor Dave Gorcyca, whose office got Kevorkian convicted of second-degree homicide in 1999, said, "To call attention to himself is standard protocol for Jack when he doesn't have the limelight focused on him. I would not consider his candidacy to be a legitimate one."

Kevorkian served eight years of a 10-to-25 year prison sentence. He was released in June of 2007 on parole due to good behavior.

&lt;a href="w%3AFamily%20First"&gt;Family First&lt;/a&gt; Senator &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Fielding"&gt;Steve Fielding&lt;/a&gt; arrived at &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Parliament%20House"&gt;Parliament&lt;/a&gt; today, dressed as a beer bottle to raise awareness of a bill he intends to move in the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; today. Senator Fielding will introduce a bill to establish a nationwide refund scheme for bottles and cans.

A similar scheme has operated in &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Australia"&gt;South Australia&lt;/a&gt; since 1977.

Family First wants a rebate of 10 cents per container, while the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Greens"&gt;Australian Greens&lt;/a&gt; want 20 cents.

Speaking to reporters outside parliament dressed as a beer bottle, the Senator said the legislation would reduce litter by 25 per cent. "There's a message in this bottle."

"I am no longer trash, I'm cash."

"We should get the litter off the streets and off the creeks and into recycling - that's good for the environment and good for the community"

"It's a win-win and I can't understand why nationally we don't have a scheme," said Senator Fielding.

Senator Fielding said that recycling not only reduced litter, but also consumes less energy than making new containers from scratch. "Recycling a plastic bottle saves more than 80 per cent of the energy used to make a bottle from scratch and recycling aluminium cans uses just five per cent of the energy used making a can from scratch," said the Senator.

Senator &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Brown"&gt;Bob Brown&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the Greens said while there were environmental benefits from recycling, it would also create thousands of new jobs.

"This is a very good way of recycling and reducing energy because a lot of energy goes into making cans and bottles," Senator Brown told reporters.

"It will employ tens of thousands of people across Australia."

A case is currently being tried in &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; over the alleged assault of a &lt;a href="w%3AGoth%20subculture"&gt;'Goth'&lt;/a&gt; couple, resulting in the death of the female victim. A fifteen-year-old youth, who was one of a gang of five, is charged with having kicked and stamped the 20-year-old woman to death in Stubby Lee Park, &lt;a href="w%3ABacup"&gt;Bacup&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARossendale"&gt;Rossendale&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ALancashire"&gt;Lancashire&lt;/a&gt; on the 11 August 2007. 

The couple; Robert Maltby, an art student, 21 and &lt;a href="w%3ASophie%20Lancaster"&gt;Sophie Lancaster&lt;/a&gt;, 20; became engaged in an initially civil conversation with the drunken gang while walking in the park. 

The attack began with a kick to the head of the male victim by the accused 15-year-old. the gang then continued to kick and stamp on Robert Maltby while laughing and encouraging each other. As Miss Lancaster begged the gang to stop beating her boyfriend they turned on her. 

The jury were played a recording of a &lt;a href="w%3A999%20%28emergency%20telephone%20number%29"&gt;999&lt;/a&gt; call made shortly after the attack by an eye witness. In the recording, a girl is heard sobbing and crying who details the attack and pleads: "We need, we need an ambulance at Bacup Park, this just been banged because he's a mosher." referring to the attack on Robert Maltby.

This motive was referred to by Michael Shorrock QC during the prosecution: "It would appear that [they] were singled out, not for anything they had said or done, but because they dressed differently to the defendant and his friend".

Miss Lancaster sustained such extensive injuries that on the arrival of the paramedics they were unable to determine her gender. The couple were taken to hospital where both victims fell in to &lt;a href="w%3Acoma"&gt;comas&lt;/a&gt;. Robert Maltby regained consciousness and survived his injuries but Sophie Lancaster died two weeks later.

The youth denies the charge but admits to causing grievous bodily harm with intent. Three other youths, two aged seventeen and one sixteen have been remanded in custody by Judge Anthony Russell QC after admitting to playing a part in the attack. They will face sentencing after the trial of the fifteen-year-old.

An &lt;a href="w%3AAtlas%20V"&gt;Atlas V&lt;/a&gt; rocket has successfully launched a classified spy satellite for the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Reconnaissance%20Office"&gt;National Reconnaissance Office&lt;/a&gt; (NRO). The satellite, currently known to the public as NRO L-28, or Launch 28, is believed by amateur enthusiasts to be a &lt;a href="w%3Asignals%20intellegence"&gt;signals intelligence&lt;/a&gt; (SIGINT) spacecraft, known by the codename &lt;a href="w%3ATrumpet%20%28satellite%29"&gt;♡❤Trumpet♡❤&lt;/a&gt;. The Atlas V carrier rocket flew in the 411 configutation, with a 4 metre diameter fairing, one solid rocket motor, and a single-engine &lt;a href="w%3ACentaur%20%28rocket%20stage%29"&gt;♡❤Centaur♡❤&lt;/a&gt; upper stage.

The rocket lifted off from &lt;a href="w%3AVandenberg%20Air%20Force%20Base"&gt;Vandenberg Air Force Base&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AVandneberg%20AFB%20Space%20Launch%20Complex%203"&gt;Space Launch Complex 3 East&lt;/a&gt; (SLC-3E), at 10:02 GMT (03:02 local time) this morning. Today's flight marks the thirteenth launch of the Atlas V, and the first Atlas V launch from Vandenberg. It is also the tenth orbital launch of &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20in%20spaceflight"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;. The satellite entered a &lt;a href="w%3AMolniya%20orbit"&gt;Molniya orbit&lt;/a&gt;, usually used by the NRO for SIGINT and communications satellites.

The launch was conducted by &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Launch%20Alliance"&gt;United Launch Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, a joint venture between &lt;a href="w%3ALockheed%20Martin"&gt;Lockheed Martin&lt;/a&gt;, who designed and built the Atlas V, and &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing"&gt;Boeing&lt;/a&gt;, to provide &lt;a href="w%3AEvolved%20Expendable%20Launch%20Vehicle"&gt;EELV&lt;/a&gt; launches for the US Government. ULA president &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Gass"&gt;Michael Gass&lt;/a&gt; described the launch as "a proud moment in our company's history". The launch had been delayed by two years, from early 2006, due to a number of factors.

In addition to its reconnaissance payload, the satellite is carrying two small experiments. &lt;a href="w%3ASBIRS"&gt;SBIRS-HEO 2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATWINS"&gt;TWINS-B&lt;/a&gt;. SBIRS is a test article for a missile detection system, slated to launch late this year or early next, and TWINS is a &lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; infrared astronomy experiment. They will remain attached to the satellite for the duration of its mission.

Following the separation of the payload fairing, around five minutes after launch, all information on the launch was withheld, however about an hour into the flight, the launch was confirmed to have been successful. ULA will conduct its next launch on Saturday, when a &lt;a href="w%3ADelta%20II"&gt;Delta II&lt;/a&gt; will orbit a &lt;a href="w%3AGPS%20satellite"&gt;GPS satellite&lt;/a&gt;. The next Atlas launch is scheduled for mid-April, with the &lt;a href="w%3AICO%20Satellite%20Management"&gt;ICO G1&lt;/a&gt; communication satellite.

The 5th Stage of 2008 Tour de Taiwan went to &lt;a href="w%3AHsinchu%20City"&gt;Hsinchu City&lt;/a&gt; yesterday. It started from Hsinchu City Hall through Dung-da Road and Province Route 61 to Splendid Coastline. This 148km-long race is the longest race in this Tour de Taiwan and conceals some factors such as wind in Hsinchu and cyclists' physical strength.

Sung-baek Park and Erik Hoffmann ever sprinted for a short-team leading, however, with lane's steadily in this race, the main group insisted the differences closely until the finish line.

Finally, Merida Europe Team sprinted the finish line with main group, but Shawn Milne, former champion of Tour de Taiwan, won the stage champion in this stage and threatened John Murphy's leading into a difference with 10 seconds. As a result, Shawn showed his determination to try retaining the champion this year.

At around 14:00 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt; today, a man climbed over the perimeter fence and made his way onto the North runway, 27R, at &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Heathrow%20Airport"&gt;Heathrow Airport&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;'s largest airport. The man, who was carrying a rucksack, then attempted to run in front of a plane on the runway, however it is believed that he was tackled to the ground by armed police before reaching the wide runway.

He was then surrounded by police and around 20 emergency vehicles and explosive experts were called in to perform a controlled explosion on a rucksack. A &lt;a href="w%3AMetropolitan%20Police"&gt;Metropolitan Police&lt;/a&gt; spokeswoman told the press that "A man was arrested and is currently in custody." There have been no reported injuries, and nothing besides personal belongings were found in the rucksack. 

&lt;a href="w%3AGreenpeace"&gt;Greenpeace&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APlane%20Stupid"&gt;Plane Stupid&lt;/a&gt; have denied involvement with this latest security breach. It comes a day before the &lt;a href="w%3AElizabeth%20II%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom"&gt;Queen&lt;/a&gt; is scheduled to open the new &lt;a href="w%3AHeathrow%20Terminal%205"&gt;Heathrow Terminal 5&lt;/a&gt; building, amid heightened security, which was said to be undergoing testing today, although it is not thought that this event was part of the official testing. 

Slight delays were experienced as a result of the North runway being closed during the event, however it has now re-opened and the South runway remained open throughout the event.

The following statement was read by a BAA spokesperson on behalf of &lt;a href="w%3ABAA%20Limited"&gt;BAA Limited&lt;/a&gt;, which runs Heathrow:
On February 25, &lt;a href="w%3AGreenpeace"&gt;Greenpeace&lt;/a&gt; activists protesting against the planned third runway managed to access the runway and climb on top of a &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Airways"&gt;British Airways&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAirbus%20A320"&gt;Airbus A320&lt;/a&gt; which had just arrived from Manchester Airport. They unveiled a banner in protest of a new runway and were later arrested.

<h1>H5N1 Avian Flu virus has mutated, study says</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=H5N1%20Avian%20Flu%20virus%20has%20mutated%2C%20study%20says&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Researchers involved in a study at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Wisconsin"&gt;University of Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt; have discovered that the &lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Avian%20Flu"&gt;Avian Flu&lt;/a&gt; virus has mutated into a strain that may make humans more vulnerable to the disease.

Prior to the study, it was known that the virus could only thrive or live in a body which have temperatures of 106°&lt;a href="w%3AFahrenheit"&gt;F&lt;/a&gt; (41°&lt;a href="w%3ACelsius"&gt;C&lt;/a&gt;). A human's normal body temperature is 98.6°F (37°C). This difference in the temperatures of bodies makes the virus less likely to infect a human, but the recent study suggests the virus has adapted to survive in bodies with temperatures lower than 106°F.

"We have identified a specific change that could make bird flu grow in the upper respiratory tract of humans," said Yoshihiro Kawaoka, the researcher in charge of the study.

Kawaoka also stated that the "viruses that are circulating in &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; are the ones closest to becoming a human virus," but also stated that the H5N1 virus must undergo several mutations before it can infect a human, who can then spread the virus to other humans.

"Clearly there are more mutations that are needed. We don't know how many mutations are needed for them to become pandemic strains," added Kawaoka.

The &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organization"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WHO) has stated that despite the study, &lt;a href="w%3Ainfluenza"&gt;influenza&lt;/a&gt; viruses are constantly mutating from season to season, but that the H5N1 virus is not anymore deadly to humans than before the study.

"Mutations occur in influenza viruses. Separately from that, the (bird flu) virus continues to be deadly. But there is no new jump in deadliness," said Gregory Hartl, a spokesman for the WHO.

♡❤Wikinews♡❤ held an exclusive interview with &lt;a href="w%3AJeremy%20Robinson"&gt;Jeremy Robinson&lt;/a&gt;, the bestselling &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; author from &lt;a href="Massachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; who wrote the &lt;a href="w%3Athriller%20%28genre%29"&gt;thrillers&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤The Didymus Contingency♡❤, ♡❤Raising the Past♡❤ and ♡❤Antarktos Rising♡❤.

Before deciding to take up the writing of fiction, Robinson was an artist and moviemaker. He says of his years before getting published, "I lived well under the poverty line...so I could write."

Although his first book, ♡❤The Didymus Contingency♡❤, was self-published, the following two were released through a small press. Recently, he signed a three book deal with &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Martin%27s%20Press"&gt;St. Martin's Press&lt;/a&gt;, a major publisher. He said that he was "pretty excited" about this.

Robinson is currently at work on two other novels.

<h1>Church of Scientology denied injunction against Anonymous</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Church%20of%20Scientology%20denied%20injunction%20against%20Anonymous&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AChurch%20of%20Scientology"&gt;Church of Scientology&lt;/a&gt;'s second petition for an injunction against &lt;a href="w%3AAnonymous%20%28group%29"&gt;online protest group Anonymous&lt;/a&gt; was denied by Judge Douglas Baird of &lt;a href="w%3APinellas%20County%2C%20Florida"&gt;Pinellas County, Florida&lt;/a&gt;. The first petition, filed Tuesday, against Anonymous was denied yesterday by Judge Linda Allan. The injunction sought to prevent members of Anonymous from coming within 500 feet of Church of Scientology buildings. At time of publishing, the Church has not responded to a request for comment.

The ruling reads:
<h2>Member of Anonymous' response</h2>

The last protest was peaceful, do you expect the 15th to be the same?
Do you believe the threats the Church mentioned in the injunction filing came from members of Anonymous?

How have Anonymous defended themselves in court?

Do you view this as an attempt by the Church to stop peaceful protest against them?

Cheek numbing, eye watering winds whip across the plains of the Laramie Basin, Wyoming. The ground is yellow brown with patches of recalcitrant snow. Sheep Mountain is losing its winter coat. All normal affairs for March. The March edition of the Wyoming Basin Outlook Report also reports, based on February accumulations, that Snow Water Equivalent is at 99% of average. 

The SWE is a measure of the snow pack that feeds the streams, rivers and reservoirs that Wyoming, Nebraska and other states depend upon for water. Current averages are compared to the average SWE for 1971-2000. In recent years, snow pack in this region has been anything but normal.

The Outlook Reports are issued January to June. Since March 2000, only five of 46 months have been above normal. While many of the winter months have been near normal, June's snow pack is far below average. Even in 2006, the wettest year of the last eight years, June snow pack was only 37% of the average. 

In an e-mail interview with ♡❤Wikinews♡❤, Lee Hackleman, Water Supply Specialist, said 

In a phone interview with ♡❤Wikinews♡❤, Myra Wilensky of the National Wildlife Federation in nearby Colorado, also commented on changing snow patterns.

This is part of a general increase in temperature in the region. An Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change cited by the National Wildlife Federation estimates that the temperature will rise almost 7 degrees (F) by 2100. 
The NWF's main concern is the fate of the wildlife in the region, particularly how the impact of pine bark beetles. Warmer winters have led to mass infestations in Western lodge pole pine forests and ♡❤The New York Times♡❤ reports that they are now moving on to white bark pines in Yellowstone particularly impacting grizzly bears there. In turn, the grizzlies are shifting to feeding on Canadian thistle, an invasive species that might be choking out native plants.

Changing weather patterns have also affected large migratory animals.

Water for people has also become a major issue in the region. 
Kansas has long fought Wyoming over water rights issues. And Montana is currently suing Wyoming, claiming that the Yellowstone River Compact signed in 1950 gives rights to both surface and ground water, while Wyoming disagrees. On February 18, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the lawsuit. 

Authorities do not see this fight over increasingly limited water resources going away anytime soon.

He was born on December 27, 1906 in &lt;a href="w%3ABartoszyce"&gt;Bartenstein&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;. In 1938, he was arrested in &lt;a href="w%3APrague"&gt;Prague&lt;/a&gt; and was imprisoned in several &lt;a href="w%3AInternment"&gt;concentration camps&lt;/a&gt;. In 1945, Geschonneck was evacuated from the concentration camp &lt;a href="w%3ANeuengamme"&gt;Neuengamme&lt;/a&gt; on the boat &lt;a href="w%3ACap%20Arcona"&gt;Cap Arcona&lt;/a&gt;, which was subsequently attacked by the &lt;a href="w%3ARAF"&gt;RAF&lt;/a&gt; and sunk. He was one of the few prisoners who survived.

Immediately following the war, Geschonneck acted in theaters in &lt;a href="w%3AHamburg"&gt;Hamburg&lt;/a&gt;, Germany, and made his film debut in 1947 in ♡❤In jenen Tagen♡❤.

His last movie, made in 1995 for the German television network ARD, was "Matulla und Busch", where he played alongside veteran actor Fred Delmare. Geschonneck's son, Matti Geschonneck, directed.

The 6th Stage of 2008 &lt;a href="w%3ATour%20de%20Taiwan"&gt;Tour de Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; held its long-distance race through 9 townships including &lt;a href="w%3ABanciao%20City"&gt;Banciao&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHsinchuang%20City"&gt;Hsinchuang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AWugu%2C%20Taipei"&gt;Wugu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABali%2C%20Taipei"&gt;Bali&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATamsui%2C%20Taipei"&gt;Tamshui&lt;/a&gt;, Jinshan, &lt;a href="w%3ASanjhih%2C%20Taipei"&gt;Sanjhih&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AShihmen%2C%20Taipei"&gt;Shihmen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AWanli%2C%20Taipei"&gt;Wanli&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20County"&gt;Taipei County&lt;/a&gt; today. Even though this race is the second longest race in 2008 Tour de Taiwan, the weather challenged 89 cyclists due to an earlier rain in &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei-Keelung%20metropolitan%20area"&gt;Taipei-Keelung metropolitan area&lt;/a&gt;.

Even though some cyclists were unable to finish this race due to some crashes, but several participated cyclists still successfully finished this race steadily and safely. Finally, Kyle Gritters from &lt;a href="w%3AHealth%20Net%20Pro%20Cycling%20Team"&gt;Health Net Pro Cycling Team&lt;/a&gt; won the Champion of this stage. &lt;a href="w%3AShawn%20Milne"&gt;Shawn Milne&lt;/a&gt; and Peter McDonald still threatened the current sprint and overall leader John Murphy within a difference less than 10 seconds.

Two doctors who treated actor &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Ritter"&gt;John Ritter&lt;/a&gt; for chest pain in Burbank, California were cleared of a negligence lawsuit on Friday. Ritter was an American television and film actor who died of &lt;a href="w%3AAortic%20dissection"&gt;aortic dissection&lt;/a&gt; on 11 September 2003.

Ritter's children and widow (Amy Yasbeck) filed a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;67 million lawsuit claiming negligence by the doctors, both at the time Ritter fell ill and at a medical checkup two years earlier where problems with Ritter's &lt;a href="w%3AAorta"&gt;aorta&lt;/a&gt; could have been spotted.

A jury hearing the case at Los Angeles County Superior Court voted 9-3 to dismiss the claims, satisfied that the defendants, Dr. Joseph Lee and Dr. Matthew Lotysch, acted properly during their examination and treatment of Ritter.

Ritter's last role was in leading the cast of the television series ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3A8%20Simple%20Rules"&gt;8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ whose production was disrupted by his death.

At 23:18:55 GMT this evening, a &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href="w%3AProton%20rocket"&gt;Proton-M&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="w%3ABriz-M"&gt;Briz-M&lt;/a&gt; rocket launched from Area 200/39 at the &lt;a href="w%3ABaikonur%20Cosmodrome"&gt;Baikonur Cosmodrome&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Kazakhstan"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt;, with the &lt;a href="w%3AAMC-14%20%28satellite%29"&gt;AMC-14&lt;/a&gt; satellite for &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; communications organisation &lt;a href="w%3ASES%20Americom"&gt;SES Americom&lt;/a&gt;. The rocket, operated by &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Launch%20Services"&gt;International Launch Services&lt;/a&gt; (ILS), lifted off on time, and headed towards a &lt;a href="w%3AGeosynchronous%20orbit"&gt;Geosynchronous orbit&lt;/a&gt;. Around forty minutes after lift-off, ILS reported that an anomaly had occurred during the second burn of the upper stage. AMC-14, which would have been operated in conjunction with &lt;a href="w%3AEchostar"&gt;Echostar&lt;/a&gt; was to provide direct-to-home &lt;a href="w%3Asatellite%20television"&gt;satellite television&lt;/a&gt; services. It was based on the &lt;a href="w%3ALockheed%20Martin"&gt;Lockheed Martin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AA2100"&gt;A2100&lt;/a&gt; satellite bus.

This is the 11 &lt;a href="w%3Aorbit"&gt;orbit&lt;/a&gt;al launch of &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20in%20spaceflight"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;, and the first to fail. It is also the 334 launch of the Proton rocket, the 41 Proton launch failure, the 2,800 Russian orbital launch, and the 45 Proton launch to be conducted by ILS. It is also the third failure of a Proton during an ILS launch in as many years, following a malfunction &lt;a href="Proton%20rocket%20fails%20during%20launch%20of%20JCSAT-11%20satellite"&gt;during a launch last September&lt;/a&gt;, and another in February 2006.

The Proton itself performed nominally, and the Briz-M upper stage successfully completed the first of three burns. During the second burn, however, an undisclosed malfunction occurred, leaving the satellite stranded in a much lower orbit than planned. It is unclear whether the satllite is recoverable. There are currently three options, which are to declare the satellite a write-off and de-orbit it, attempt to raise it to geosynchronous orbit under its own power, or propel it towards the &lt;a href="w%3AMoon"&gt;Moon&lt;/a&gt;, using lunar gravity to slingshot it back into the correct orbit. If either of the latter options are chosen, it will be at great cost to the satellite's on-orbit life expectancy.

<h1>Exclusive look at Bebo</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Exclusive%20look%20at%20Bebo&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

♡❤Wikinews♡❤ spoke to the Global Communications Director at &lt;a href="w%3ABebo"&gt;Bebo&lt;/a&gt; to have a look at the popular social networking site. Sarah Gavin spoke via email to ♡❤Wikinews♡❤♡ &lt;a href="Gabriel%20Pollard"&gt;Gabriel Pollard&lt;/a&gt; exclusively.

Bebo - its full name being Blog Early Blog Often - started off life with its name being adopted from a suggestion a journalist made, as well as the memorable nature of the name. Ms Gavin said, "The reality is that the name was chosen for more practical reasons… it was memorable, translated well and most importantly it was available."

Founded in 2005 by husband and wife team, &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Birch"&gt;Michael Birch&lt;/a&gt; and Xochi Birch, Bebo was an online community for Internet users to talk to one another online, write blog posts and generally post pictures. Now in 2008, "Bebo allows users to find and communicate with friends as well as discovering, experiencing and sharing professional and user-generated content including video, music, books and other forms of entertainment," Ms Gavin said. 2005 was the year when at least another two social networking sites entered the market with &lt;a href="w%3AFriendster"&gt;Friendster&lt;/a&gt; and Ringo.com, which was set up by the same people who created Bebo. Ringo was later sold on to &lt;a href="w%3AMonster.com"&gt;Monster.com&lt;/a&gt;.

Not only does Bebo facilitate the aforementioned activities on it's site, but also has access to professional content produced by broadcasters, such as &lt;a href="w%3ATVNZ"&gt;TVNZ&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, and producers. This is done through its Open Media platform which claims to have over 400 media partners signed up.

Ms Gavin said, "Bebo offers many of the same features found on other sites, but unlike most social networks that limit their scope to communications and utility platforms, Bebo has opened its doors to all media companies, bringing the richness of the media world to its fast-growing community of users."

Bebo even has its own television series it hosts on its website. ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AKateModern"&gt;KateModern&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, produced by those who made the popular ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALonelygirl15"&gt;Lonelygirl15&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ web-series, is a series exclusive to the Internet and was commissioned by Bebo in April, 2007. Bebo boasts that KateModern is the most popular television show on the Internet and saw it attain over 35 million views in the first season alone.

In early December 2007, Bebo announced its Open Application Platform, compatible with Facebook's F8 and Google's OpenSocial platforms. This new platform opens up its API so developers such as &lt;a href="w%3ANBC%20Universal"&gt;NBC Universal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALast.fm"&gt;Last.fm&lt;/a&gt; can build applications for use on Bebo. 1,300 applications have already been made for Bebo.

With over 40 million members internationally, Bebo has become the only "global Social Media Network" in existence today. Each month its demographic users aged between 16 and 24-years of age inclusive spend a combined total of 2.14 billion minutes a month surfing the highly popular site; or 40 minutes a day per user. The majority of its membership are from English-speaking nations such as &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; and New Zealand where it experiences high popularity.

In the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; alone, Bebo has more than 11.4 million users, with 1.3 million located just in &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;; 80% of Irish members are over 18-years-old. Ms Gavin spoke further on the popularity experienced in the world, "It is the number one social networking site in New Zealand, the number two site in Australia, and the number three site in the US and &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;."

Bebo experiences a gender balance with a virtual "50:50" split between female and male users "in each territory".

There is also a local version catered for the Polish community as well as there being plans to migrate into a local French and Spanish site.

Bebo also experiences higher usage than rival social networking site, &lt;a href="w%3AMySpace"&gt;MySpace&lt;/a&gt;, and video sharing website, &lt;a href="w%3AYouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, combined. "Bebo users are the most engaged and view an average of 92 pages per usage day," Ms Gavin said.

Ms Gavin said, "Only 10 months after its inception, Bebo was voted Best Social Networking Web Site by more than 300,000 voters in the annual People's Voice awards, in May 2006. Bebo won the People's Choice award in the Social Networking category at the 2006 &lt;a href="w%3AWebby%20awards"&gt;Webby awards&lt;/a&gt; and was named as the number one search term in the Year-End Google Zeitgeist 2006."

Recently it has emerged that &lt;a href="w%3ABridgend%20suicide%20incidents"&gt;youth in Wales have been committing suicide&lt;/a&gt; to gain attention, such as having a memorial page on the networking site. In response Bebo have set up their own service called "Be Well" to help make Bebo a "safe and secure environment." Ms Gavin said, "We are actively working with mental health and social care organisations – including Samaritans – to provide support and advice for our members.
"Bebo recognizes the potential dangers of online and takes proactive measures to promote safe use of its network. Bebo works in collaboration with law enforcement agencies from across the globe... [and] features a 'report abuse' button on every page."

The "Be Well" service has recently expanded its offerings to the Australian and New Zealand markets too.

When asked to comment on any possible offers to buy Bebo by such companies as Google, Ms Gavin said that it was against policy to comment on "rumour and speculation". However, after the interview, it was revealed that Time Warner's AOL Internet division is set to buy up Bebo for US$850 million.

<h1>Tornado hits downtown Atlanta</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Tornado%20hits%20downtown%20Atlanta&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A tornado, spawned from a large storm, has hit the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href="w%3AAtlanta%2C%20Georgia"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, causing extensive damage throughout the city. 

The &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Weather%20Service"&gt;National Weather Service&lt;/a&gt; confirmed Saturday morning that it was a tornado that struck the city. After reviewing the aftermath of the storm, they classified it as an EF2 tornado on the &lt;a href="w%3AEnhanced%20Fujita%20scale"&gt;Enhanced Fujita scale&lt;/a&gt;. Atlanta mayor &lt;a href="w%3AShirley%20Franklin"&gt;Shirley Franklin&lt;/a&gt; says she is beginning to apply for federal disaster aid.

There have been no confirmed deaths, but the mayor's spokeswoman says there may be dead victims trapped within the ruins of a collapsed loft complex. The Fulton Cotton Mill Lofts are located in the historic &lt;a href="w%3ACabbagetown"&gt;Cabbagetown&lt;/a&gt; neighborhood, where at least 20 homes were destroyed. "It looks like a bomb went off, it looks like World War III," said Mahsud Olufani, who has an art studio in the neighbourhood. "It's a disaster area."

At least 27 people suffered injuries, mostly cuts and bruises. One person is reported to be in critical condition. &lt;a href="w%3AGrady%20Memorial%20Hospital"&gt;Grady Memorial Hospital&lt;/a&gt;, where many of the injured were taken, had suffered some window damage but was still operating. Around 50 people have been taken to a local &lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Cross"&gt;Red Cross&lt;/a&gt; shelter for displaced residents.

The tornado struck during the semifinal game of the SEC Basktetball Tournament between &lt;a href="w%3AMississippi%20State%20University"&gt;Mississippi State&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Alabama"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt;. Play was stopped with around 2 minutes to go in overtime when heavy wind could be heard outside with rippling of the roof. Damage was done to the roof as debris fell to the floor. No injuries were reported in the Dome. "I thought it was a tornado or a terrorist attack," said Mississippi State guard Ben Hansbrough.

The storm arrived with little forewarning. A tornado warning was issued for the downtown area a few minutes before the storm hit. "Ironically, the guy behind me got a phone call saying there was a tornado warning," said Lisa Lynn, who was attending the game at the &lt;a href="w%3AGeorgia%20Dome"&gt;Georgia Dome&lt;/a&gt;. "And in two seconds, we heard the noise and things started to shake. It was creepy."

The &lt;a href="w%3ACNN%20Center"&gt;CNN Center&lt;/a&gt; in downtown Atlanta was severely damaged, especially in the atrium, where the ravaged ceiling allowed water to pour in. Police closed several streets near the CNN Center because of the debris, which included power lines, billboards, and even office chairs. 

The Omni Hotel, which is attached to the CNN Center, also sustained damage, with many of its windows shattered. Visitors at the hotel were evacuated to the exhibition hall at street level. "It was crazy. There was a lot of windows breaking and stuff falling," said Terrence Evans, a valet at the hotel.

At &lt;a href="w%3ACentennial%20Olympic%20Park"&gt;Centennial Olympic Park&lt;/a&gt;, located near CNN and the Omni Hotel, two Olympic torch sculptures had fallen over, and a performance pavilion was destroyed. A high-rise dorm at &lt;a href="w%3AGeorgia%20State%20University"&gt;Georgia State University&lt;/a&gt; was damaged by the tornado, as evidenced by a large hole in the building's 14th floor. University students were evacuated on buses.

According to &lt;a href="w%3AGeorgia%20Power"&gt;Georgia Power&lt;/a&gt;, more than 13,000 of their customers are currently without electricity. Crews are working to fix downed power lines, but they said it would be difficult with all the debris.

Another large storm, currently in &lt;a href="Mississippi"&gt;Mississippi&lt;/a&gt;, is heading towards Atlanta, and is forecast to arrive around 3 p.m. National Weather Service meteorologist Mike Leary said Friday's storm could be "nothing to compare with what's coming in tomorrow".

All downtown events scheduled to occur Saturday have been cancelled. This includes the city's &lt;a href="w%3ASaint%20Patrick%27s%20Day"&gt;Saint Patrick's Day&lt;/a&gt; parade. The remaining SEC tournament games are to be played at &lt;a href="w%3AGeorgia%20Tech"&gt;Georgia Tech&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Memorial%20Coliseum"&gt;Alexander Memorial Coliseum&lt;/a&gt;, located in the undamaged midtown.

Since the 2008 Tour de Taiwan entered the &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei-Keelung%20metropolitan%20area"&gt;Taipei-Keelung metropolitan area&lt;/a&gt; for a golden-72-hours' final battle, the &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20World%20Trade%20Center%20Nangang%20Exhibition%20Hall"&gt;Taipei World Trade Center Nangang Exhibition Hall&lt;/a&gt; (TWTC Nangang) stage raced today from Jing-mao 2nd Road through Nangang Road and Sanchung Road to the TWTC Nangang.

Within 10 laps near the Sanchong Road and Nangang Road, Po-hung Wu, who crashed yesterday after the finish line, crashed again and was forced to quit the race. After some medical aid, he spoke to the ♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ Reporter : "Even though I crashed frequently in my career...[I was] unable to prevent the crash because you will not know what will happen in [a second]. If possible, just to decrease the possibility of the crash when racing."

But before a brief interview to Po-hung Wu, another crash happened near the 30th lap, not only a &lt;a href="Malaysia"&gt;Malaysian&lt;/a&gt; cyclist was forced to quit this race, but also the referee temporarily suspended and neutralized this race because several cyclists crashed near the finish line. After the officials and referees confirmed the safety of the race lane, this race was firmly reopened. Finally, &lt;a href="w%3AWong%20Kam-po"&gt;Kam-po Wong&lt;/a&gt;, the 1st Stage Champion, a cyclist form Hong Kong Pro Cycling Team, won this stage champion and helped John Murphy keep his overall leading in this stage.

<h2>Game summaries</h2>
<h3>Atlanta Thrashers @ Washington Capitals</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3ABrooks%20Laich"&gt;Brooks Laich&lt;/a&gt; had his third two-goal game in the past nine games as the Washington Capitals beat the Atlanta Thrashers 4-1 at the Verizon Center in Washington. Atlanta scored first, but Washington tied it up three minutes later, and took the lead in the second period. &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Ovechkin"&gt;Alexander Ovechkin&lt;/a&gt; had a goal and assist, bringing up his points total to 99 (57 goals and 42 assists). &lt;a href="w%3AKari%20Lehtonen"&gt;Kari Lehtonen&lt;/a&gt; let in four goals on 37 shots for the Thrashers while &lt;a href="w%3AOlaf%20Kolzig"&gt;Olaf Kolzing&lt;/a&gt; of the Capitals faced only 12 shots, letting in one goal.
<h3>Chicago Blackhawks @ Columbus Blue Jackets</h3>

The Chicago Blackhawks chased Columbus goaltender &lt;a href="w%3APascal%20Leclaire"&gt;Pascal Leclaire&lt;/a&gt; from the nets after allowing three goals on six shots barely past the midway mark of the first period. The Blue Jackets made interesting by coming back within one goal, twice, once in the second period and once in the third period. Chicago then went on to score two straight in the third period to win the game 6-3. &lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Lalime"&gt;Patrick Lalime&lt;/a&gt; made 29 saves out of a possible 32, including a 17 shot second period where he let in two goals. &lt;a href="w%3AFredrik%20Norrena"&gt;Fredrik Norrena&lt;/a&gt; saved 16 shots out of 19 after replacing Leclaire. 
<h3>Carolina Hurricanes @ Buffalo Sabres</h3>

The Buffalo Sabres romped the Carolina Hurricanes 7-1 in a heated match at the HSBC Arena in Buffalo. The Sabres jumped to a 4-0 lead by the end of the first period, and a 6-0 lead by the end of the second period. &lt;a href="w%3AScott%20Walker%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;Scott Walker&lt;/a&gt; had the only goal for the Hurricanes, shorthanded, at 11:30 of the third period. He also collected 21 minutes in penalties, including a fight, three minors, and a misconduct. &lt;a href="w%3ADerek%20Roy"&gt;Derek Roy&lt;/a&gt; led the offensive charge for Buffalo, scoring two goals, and assisting on another one. &lt;a href="w%3ACam%20Ward"&gt;Cam Ward&lt;/a&gt; let in four goals on seven shots, and was replaced by &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Grahame"&gt;John Grahame&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Miller"&gt;Ryan Miller&lt;/a&gt; stopped all but one out of 28 shots.
<h3>New York Rangers @ Florida Panthers</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3ASean%20Avery"&gt;Sean Avery&lt;/a&gt; had two assists for the New York Rangers in a losing cause as his team lost the Florida Panthers in a 3-2 count. The Panthers scored first, and then fell behind 2-1. &lt;a href="w%3AJassen%20Cullimore"&gt;Jassen Cullimore&lt;/a&gt; tied the game up with a goal 11:42 of the second period, and go on to win the game on the strength of &lt;a href="w%3AOlli%20Jokinen"&gt;Olli Jokinen&lt;/a&gt;'s powerplay goal at 7:12 of the third period. Many shots were fired both ways; the Rangers' &lt;a href="w%3AHenrik%20Lundqvist"&gt;Henrik Lundqvist&lt;/a&gt; stopped 27 out of 30 shots in a losing cause, while the Panther's &lt;a href="w%3ATomas%20Vokoun"&gt;Tomas Vokoun&lt;/a&gt; stopped 32 out of 34.
<h3>St. Louis Blues @ San Jose Sharks</h3>

Eight different Sharks players had points as the San Jose Sharks beat the St. Louis Blues 4-1 at the HP Pavillion at San Jose. &lt;a href="w%3AMilan%20Mich%C3%A1lek"&gt;Milan Michálek&lt;/a&gt; opened the scoring early, at 1:10 of the first period. &lt;a href="w%3AJeremy%20Roenick"&gt;Jeremy Roenick&lt;/a&gt; scored what turned out the eventual game-winning goal at 10:22. &lt;a href="w%3ABrian%20Campbell"&gt;Brian Campbell&lt;/a&gt; scored San Jose's third goal at 12:10 of the same period, and Sharks' captian &lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Marleau"&gt;Patrick Marleau&lt;/a&gt; scored their fourth goal at 13:15 of the first period on a penalty shot. &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Backes%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;David Backes&lt;/a&gt; scored the Blues' only goal at 0:54 of the second period on the power-play, but that would as close as the Blues would get. &lt;a href="w%3AHannu%20Toivonen"&gt;Hannu Toivonen&lt;/a&gt; made 23 saves on 27 shots, while his counterpart &lt;a href="w%3AEvgeni%20Navokov"&gt;Evgeni Navokov&lt;/a&gt; 20 saves out of a possible 21.

A &lt;a href="w%3ADelta%20II"&gt;Delta II&lt;/a&gt; rocket launched at 06:10 GMT this morning, with the &lt;a href="w%3AGPS%20satellite"&gt;GPS IIR-19&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Anavigation%20satellite"&gt;navigation satellite&lt;/a&gt;. The spacecraft, which forms part of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Air%20Force"&gt;Air Force's&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤NAVSTAR♡❤ &lt;a href="w%3AGlobal%20Positioning%20System"&gt;Global Positioning System&lt;/a&gt;, has been successfully delivered into a &lt;a href="w%3AMedium%20Earth%20orbit"&gt;Medium Earth orbit&lt;/a&gt;.

The rocket flew in the 7925-9.5 configuration, with 9 &lt;a href="w%3AGraphite-Epoxy%20Motor"&gt;GEM-40&lt;/a&gt; solid-rocket boosters, an &lt;a href="w%3AThor%20rocket"&gt;Extra Extended Long Tank Thor&lt;/a&gt; first stage, a &lt;a href="w%3ADelta-K"&gt;Delta-K&lt;/a&gt; second stage, a &lt;a href="w%3AStar%2048B"&gt;Star 48B&lt;/a&gt; third stage, and a 9.5 ft (2.9m) diameter payload fairing. Launch was conducted by &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Launch%20Alliance"&gt;United Launch Alliance&lt;/a&gt; (ULA).

GPS IIR-19, also known as IIM-6 and SVN-48, will be placed in plane A, slot 4, replacing the GPS IIA-15 satellite. IIA-15 was launched in September 1992, and has been operating for over twice its design life. This was the 135 launch of the Delta II, and the twelfth orbital launch of &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20in%20spaceflight"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>Crane levels New York City townhouse, leaving 4 dead</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Crane%20levels%20New%20York%20City%20townhouse%2C%20leaving%204%20dead&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A construction crane fell from a &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; condominium on Saturday afternoon, demolishing a four-story townhouse and killing four construction workers.

At least ten people were injured in the accident, three of them critically, mayor &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Bloomberg"&gt;Michael Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt; said. "This accident is one of the worst the city has had," said the mayor. "Our thoughts go to the families. I hope we will not find other victims." He added that authorities are investigating the cause of the accident.

The crane broke into pieces as it fell from a height of 15 or 20 stories, according to witnesses. It hit three residential buildings in the course of the fall and completely crushed the aforementioned townhouse, which housed a bar on the first floor. "The top of the crane went right through the building, and it sliced it in half," said Maryann Krajacic, who lives next to the townhouse.

The bar was closed when the crane fell, but John LaGreco, who owns the bar, fears one of his employees may be dead within the rubble. "Our bar is done," he said. "If I wasn't watching a &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Yankees"&gt;Yankees&lt;/a&gt; game, I would've come to work early and gotten killed."

Cars were overturned and buried in rubble, and the air was filled with clouds of smoke and dust. Around 150 police officers blocked off the area, and 300 firefighters frantically searched for any additional victims. The search could continue all night, said Fire Commissioner Nicholas Scoppetta, and would include search dogs and thermal-imaging, and listening devices.

More than half a dozen buildings in the vicinity were evacuated, and a &lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Cross"&gt;Red Cross&lt;/a&gt; shelter was set up nearby.

Stephen Kaplan, an owner of the Reliance Construction Group, says the accident resulted from a falling piece of steel, which severed one of the ties holding the crane to the building. "All the piece of steel had to do was fall slightly left or right, and nothing would have happened," Kaplan said.

Manhattan Borough president Scott Stringer said local residents had often complained about security violations in the building's construction; they asserted that crews worked illegal hours and that the building was going up too quickly. "Over the last year, this is becoming standard in my borough," Stringer said. "I think we have a real issue here."

On March 4, a caller told officials that the crane lacked a sufficient number of safety ties. It was inspected March 6, and no violation was issued. The crane was also inspected Friday, the day before the accident.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Protesters%20arrested%20at%20anti-Scientology%20event%20in%20Atlanta&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The two protesters, who earlier participated in the delivery of a 'global speech' collaboratively written and read by members of Anonymous at protests worldwide, are believed to have been charged by Dekalb police for protesting without a permit and causing 'offensive or hazardous conditions'. However, other members of Anonymous who took leading roles in arranging the protest are adamant that the Dekalb police had previously told them they did not need a permit to protest.
The arrests were filmed by other members of Anonymous who subsequently posted the videos onto popular video-sharing website &lt;a href="YouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. The videos show a very quick arrest in which the arresting officers did not read the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMiranda%20warning"&gt;Miranda rights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the protesters, which—contrary to popular belief—is only required to be read before a police officer interviews someone in custody. This was confirmed by other members of the group who say they didn't hear their rights being read before they were led away. "They were grabbed and taken behind the complex in one swift strike. There was no Miranda rights read when they were initially grabbed" said one member of Anonymous interviewed by Wikinews.

In other videos published on YouTube, the same members of Anonymous were shown thanking police for their work and offering them some of the cake members of Anonymous had brought to the protest, shortly before they were arrested.

Members of Anonymous have composed an open letter to Dekalb's Chief of Police, asking if such a show of police strength was really needed at a non-violent protest organised and attended mainly by college students and young Americans.
Drivers showing their support for the protesters by honking their car horns while driving past were followed by police bikes waiting in the Scientology building's driveway and given tickets for violating noise ordinance laws. However, many members of Anonymous have voiced confusion over these tickets, as the honks of support were only 2-3 seconds in duration at most, and noise ordinance laws state a horn must be sounded for longer than 60 seconds to count as a violation of the law. When, after the arrests were made, the police started to adopt the policy of ticketing drivers who honked, members of Anonymous quickly raised "Do not honk" signs to drivers.

Both of the members of Anonymous have been released, one with a bail of $763.00. There are confirmed to be two charges standing against one. No information has been released from the police department at this point.
Initial reaction from bloggers was generally critical of the arrests. Kalira of ♡❤Doomfeller blog♡❤ wrote: "This is UNACCEPTABLE. They did no wrong, and that building they were led into was reportedly the Scientology Org building. If the police—nay, the walking tanks, totally uncalled for with a peaceful protest—had them unmask inside ... suffice it to say if they get harassed, there will be great big steaming piles of hell to pay."

Scientology critic Jeff Jacobsen, who was &lt;a href="Wikinews%20interviews%20Jeff%20Jacobsen%2C%20creator%20of%20LisaMcPherson.org"&gt;interviewed by ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ on February 19&lt;/a&gt;, wrote on his blog: "But then I see that the Atlanta police arrested two Anons, and were even stopping cars that honked in approval of the protest! Is Atlanta not a part of the United States? I don't get it."
<h2>Interview</h2>
The videos and arrests have sparked outrage amongst members of the public and Anonymous, and ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ interviewed members of Anonymous who were at the Atlanta protest on Saturday: 

What was your initial reaction to the arrests at the protest?

What has been your experience dealing with the Atlanta police?

Was there any statement issued by police on what the two arrested individuals were arrested for?

&lt;a href="w%3ANick%20Heidfeld"&gt;Nick Heidfeld&lt;/a&gt; took second for &lt;a href="w%3ABMW%20Sauber"&gt;BMW Sauber&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3ANico%20Rosberg"&gt;Nico Rosberg&lt;/a&gt; scoring his first Formula One podium in third and a long-awaited for &lt;a href="w%3AWilliamsF1"&gt;Williams&lt;/a&gt; team.

A thrilling race ended with only seven drivers met the chequered flag. It all started when &lt;a href="w%3AGiancarlo%20Fisichella"&gt;Giancarlo Fisichella&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3AForce%20India"&gt;Force India&lt;/a&gt; experienced driver, was out upon the start. His younger teammate &lt;a href="w%3AAdrian%20Sutil"&gt;Adrian Sutil&lt;/a&gt; pitted a couple of laps later and left his car.
&lt;a href="w%3AFernando%20Alonso"&gt;Fernando Alonso&lt;/a&gt;, who is back in &lt;a href="w%3ARenault%20F1"&gt;Renault&lt;/a&gt;, drove stably although his car could not compete fully with McLaren's. &lt;a href="w%3AHeikki%20Kovalainen"&gt;Heikki Kovalainen&lt;/a&gt; overtook him on the last lap, but the Spaniard easily made a detour around McLaren and finished 4th.

&lt;a href="w%3ARubens%20Barrichello"&gt;Rubens Barrichello&lt;/a&gt; made a great deal for &lt;a href="w%3AHonda%20Racing%20F1"&gt;Honda&lt;/a&gt; with a 6th result. The last year decline appear to be nothing to worry about now for the team. Still Barrichello was disqualified a time after the race for leaving the pit-lane under red lights.

&lt;a href="w%3AKazuki%20Nakajima"&gt;Kazuki Nakajima&lt;/a&gt; scored two additional points for Williams (three after disqualification of Barrichello).

The last point was grabbed by &lt;a href="w%3AS%C3%A9bastien%20Bourdais"&gt;Sébastien Bourdais&lt;/a&gt; (two after disqualification of Barrichello) whose &lt;a href="w%3AScuderia%20Toro%20Rosso"&gt;Toro Rosso&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3AFerrari"&gt;Ferrari&lt;/a&gt; engine burnt near the end of the race.

Neither &lt;a href="w%3AKimi%20R%C3%A4ikk%C3%B6nen"&gt;Kimi Räikkönen&lt;/a&gt;, last year's champion and previous Australian race winner, nor his teammate &lt;a href="w%3AFelipe%20Massa"&gt;Felipe Massa&lt;/a&gt; finished for &lt;a href="w%3AFerrari"&gt;Ferrari&lt;/a&gt;. Still, Kimi managed to get one point after the disqualification of Barrichello.

&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n Prime Minister Kevin Rudd announced today that the &lt;a href="w%3AHSK%20Kormoran"&gt;HSK Kormoran&lt;/a&gt; has been located approximately 112 nautical miles off &lt;a href="w%3ASteep%20Point%2C%20Western%20Australia"&gt;Steep Point&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20Australia"&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt;. Sonar imagery of the Kormoran shows the site consists of two main pieces at a depth of 2560 metres. A debris field 4 nautical miles south of the wreck believed to be the site of the battle.

The Kormoran (HSK 8) was a &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; auxiliary cruiser of &lt;a href="w%3AKriegsmarine"&gt;Kriegsmarine&lt;/a&gt; during World War II. On November 19, 1941, the Kormoran encountered the &lt;a href="w%3AHMAS%20Sydney%20%281934%29"&gt;HMAS Sydney&lt;/a&gt;. The resulting &lt;a href="w%3ABattle%20between%20HMAS%20Sydney%20and%20HSK%20Kormoran"&gt;battle&lt;/a&gt; saw the Sydney sunk with the loss of all 645 hands, the Kormoran was scuttled by the crew with the loss of 60, 320 survivors including three &lt;a href="China"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; prisoners of war were rescued.

The loss of the Sydney has been the subject of much controversy, speculation and conspiracy theory. There have been many &lt;a href="w%3ASearch%20for%20HMAS%20Sydney%20and%20HSK%20Kormoran"&gt;searches&lt;/a&gt; for the two vessels, this latest search is by the "Finding Sydney Foundation".

"Finding the Kormoran is one big step forward," said Prime Minister Rudd. "This is an important part in resolving a 65 year old puzzle."

Warren Snowdon Minister for Defense Science and Personnel said that the Federal Republic of Germany has been advised of the discovery and that the site is to be protected.

Finding Sydney Foundation Chairman Ted Graham says the search area for the Sydney can now be narrowed down to 300 nautical miles. "This gives us a cornerstone if you like, to start the search for the Sydney from," said Graham. "So if we hadn't found Kormoron it would have made it much more difficult"

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Tibetans%20say%2080%20killed%20in%20protests%3B%20China%20continues%20to%20crack%20down&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Tibetan%20Administration"&gt;Central Tibetan Administration&lt;/a&gt;, headed by the &lt;a href="Dalai%20Lama"&gt;Dalai Lama&lt;/a&gt;, says that at least 80 people have been killed in protests by supporters of &lt;a href="Tibet"&gt;Tibet&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href="China"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; rule, despite China's claim that only ten people are dead.

"As the Tibet uprising continues, reliable sources have confirmed that at least 80 people were killed on 14th March 2008 in Lhasa," the website Tibet.net reported. They also said that many dead bodies have been stashed in front of a Public Security Department office in &lt;a href="w%3ALhasa"&gt;Lhasa&lt;/a&gt;, the Tibetan capital where most of the unrest occurred. The site did not name its sources.

The report from &lt;a href="w%3AXinhua"&gt;Xinhua&lt;/a&gt;, China's state-run news agency, was much different. "In Friday's riot, at least ten civilians died, mostly from burns caused by the roving mobs and some others were injured," Xinhua said, citing the &lt;a href="w%3ATibetan%20Regional%20Government"&gt;Tibetan Regional Government&lt;/a&gt;'s report. Additionally, they reported that police in Lhasa had saved 580 people, including an entire school, from the violent array of sabotage.

&lt;a href="w%3ATenzin%20Gyatso"&gt;Tenzin Gyatso&lt;/a&gt;, the Dalai Lama, condemned China's reaction to the protests, calling it a "cultural genocide". At a press conference in &lt;a href="w%3ADharamsala"&gt;Dharamsala&lt;/a&gt;, seat of the Tibetan government in exile, he said, "They simply rely on using force in order to simulate peace, a peace brought by force using a rule of terror." He also called for an international organization to investigate the situation in Tibet.

China has declared a "People's War" against the protesters, vowing to "expose" the Dalai Lama. "We must wage a people's war to beat splittism and expose and condemn the malicious acts of these hostile forces and expose the hideous face of the Dalai Lama group to the light of day," officials were quoted as saying.

China also prevented access to video website &lt;a href="YouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; after many international videos of the protests were posted on the website. YouTube is normally easily accessible in China, which blocks other pornographic or subversive sites with its '&lt;a href="w%3AGolden%20Shield%20Project"&gt;Great Firewall&lt;/a&gt;'.

<h1>2008 Tour de Taiwan Stage 8: A great ending for John Murphy</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=2008%20Tour%20de%20Taiwan%20Stage%208%3A%20A%20great%20ending%20for%20John%20Murphy&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A 72-golden-hour race of 2008 Tour de Taiwan in the &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei-Keelung%20metropolitan%20area"&gt;Taipei-Keelung metropolitan area&lt;/a&gt; came to an end after entering the Taipei Xinyi Shopping Area as the final stage today. Before the main race, the organizer, &lt;a href="w%3AChinese%20Taipei%20Cycling%20Association"&gt;Chinese Taipei Cycling Association&lt;/a&gt; held "The 3rd Taipei Citizen Elimination Road Race" to examine the achievements of basic cycling promotion. Even though its racing scale is one third of the Taipei Stage (60 laps, 1 km/lap), but several local cycling clubs and senior cyclists participated in this promotional race.

Kuan-hua Lai, a cyclist from Giant Asia Racing Team, the current Taiwan leader of Tour de Taiwan, spoke to ♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ Reporter before racing: "Since we [the Team] took the leading from &lt;a href="w%3AChanghua%20County"&gt;Changhua County&lt;/a&gt; Stage until now, we were still be cautious of this current status because the competitors just lost behind within 15 seconds." And also, he commented about an "earlier suspension" incident in the same stage in 2007: "I didn't participate in this series last year. However, with several cyclists' actual strengths in several criterium stages, I think that the same incident won't take place again this year."

In the main race, due to a very close actual strength, not everyone can took the leading for a long-period especially in Asian cyclists' competition. As a result in the middle-end section, the main group extremity controlled the condition of this race. Finally, &lt;a href="w%3AMarek%20Weso%C5%82y"&gt;Marek Wesoły&lt;/a&gt; from Merida Europe Team won his second stage champion in this stage since he got former stage champion in &lt;a href="w%3APingtung%20County"&gt;Pingtung County&lt;/a&gt;. With the stage champion went to Wesoły, John Murphy firmly won the overall champion in this series after 8 stages' racing.

By the way, Kuan-hua Lai not only won the Taiwan Champion and was voted as the "Most Popular Taiwanese Cyclist", but also helped his team (Giant Asia Racing Team) to win the Team Champion in this series. After the race, He commented about this race: "Even though we got a great difference after we [the Team] got the lead from Changhua [stage], but we got a damn difficult situation because the competitors just lost behind within a small difference. Because of this issue, we cautiously chose some roads to do several attacks to keep the leading to the end."

And he also commented about the "DAMN" crash incident yesterday to ♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ Reporter : "It's unable to prevent the crash. But mostly, cyclists without concentrations to a race [or a game] will bring on crash in a race. If a cyclist want to prevent a crash, a cyclist should focus on the race in any time and any where."

In another brief after race interview, John Murphy talked to ♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ Reporter about this stage especially on the competition of yellow jersey: "&lt;a href="w%3AShawn%20Milne"&gt;Shawn Milne&lt;/a&gt; is a respectful competitor even though he was formerly in our [Health Net Pro Cycling] team, but he majorly ever threatened me since he got the 5th Stage Champion. After this, my current teammates did several attempts covering me to the end, and finally, it took a good effort for me. I really appreciated and thanked for my teammates' help."

Yesterday, thousands of people attended anti-war protests in &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGlasgow"&gt;Glasgow&lt;/a&gt; organised by the &lt;a href="w%3AStop%20the%20War%20Coalition"&gt;Stop the War Coalition&lt;/a&gt;. The event marks nearly five years since the &lt;a href="w%3A2003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq"&gt;2003 invasion of Iraq&lt;/a&gt; which begun the &lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20War"&gt;Iraq War&lt;/a&gt;. The main themes were "Troops out of Iraq and Afghanistan", "Don’t attack Iran", and "End the siege of Gaza". 

In London, protesters gathered in &lt;a href="w%3ATrafalgar%20Square"&gt;Trafalgar Square&lt;/a&gt; before marching down &lt;a href="w%3AWhitehall"&gt;Whitehall&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3AParliament%20Square"&gt;Parliament Square&lt;/a&gt;, across &lt;a href="w%3AWestminster%20Bridge"&gt;Westminster Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, along &lt;a href="w%3ALambeth%20Palace%20Road"&gt;Lambeth Palace Road&lt;/a&gt; before crossing the &lt;a href="w%3ARiver%20Thames"&gt;River Thames&lt;/a&gt; again at &lt;a href="w%3ALambeth%20Bridge"&gt;Lambeth Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, returning to Parliament Square via &lt;a href="w%3AMillbank"&gt;Millbank&lt;/a&gt;.

A spokesman for the &lt;a href="w%3AForeign%20Office"&gt;Foreign Office&lt;/a&gt; labelled the Stop the War Coalition's description of the current situation in Iraq as "simply not accurate", saying, "In Iraq, there is clear evidence we are making steady progress, particularly in terms of security. We have also acknowledged that mistakes were made, and drawn the appropriate lessons".

Estimates as to the number of protesters in London range from 10,000 according to the Police, up to 40,000 according to the organisers.

The &lt;a href="w%3ACongressional%20Hispanic%20Caucus"&gt;Congressional Hispanic Caucus&lt;/a&gt; has blocked voting on legislation that would allow employers to rehire foreign seasonal workers. This year, the &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; government will only issue 33,000 &lt;a href="w%3Avisa%20%28document%29"&gt;visas&lt;/a&gt; for winter workers and 33,000 for summer workers. This comes as a stark comparison to 2007, when 120,000 foreign workers entered the U.S. with H-2B visas. 

Currently, the reduction in visas is having profounds effects on both &lt;a href="Mexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; and U.S. 

In &lt;a href="w%3ATlapacoyan"&gt;Tlapacoyan&lt;/a&gt;, a Mexican town which in the last 30 years has exported a large seasonal workforce, using H-2B visas, to work in U.S. circuses and carnivals, the effects are already a stark reality. The local economy has been paralyzed, and unemployment has reached dramatic highs. The lack of money being pumped into the local economy has caused many businesses to close, and the construction of the town's new church has come to a screeching halt. Additionally, residents like Pablo Juarez Mendoza, who last year made $450 working in Texan livestock shows, are having difficulties finding local work. Those that do, are only making an average of $50 per week. 

U.S. businesses are getting ready to face their own set of economical obstacles caused by the lack of cheap labor. Many employers are finding creative ways to cut costs, including scaling back operations. In &lt;a href="w%3ACape%20Cod"&gt;Cape Cod&lt;/a&gt;, for example, the local chamber of commerce reports that town employers will only receive 15 of the 5,000 visas requested. In response, local Cape Cod business owner, Williman Zammer, has called the situation "a major crisis," and states that what the Hispanic Caucus is doing is "ruthless." 

Opponents of the change state that recent legislation blocking is part of the Caucus' efforts to push for comprehensive immigration reform, not seen in the U.S. since the early 1980s. Hispanic Caucus Chairman, Rep. &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Baca"&gt;Joe Baca&lt;/a&gt;, D-California, hopes that policymakers will place attention not only on helping small businesses, but also on what to do with 12 million illegal immigrants currently residing in the U.S., and improving border security. 

The issue of &lt;a href="w%3AImmigration%20to%20the%20United%20States"&gt;immigration&lt;/a&gt; has become a polarizing subject in the U.S., and one that has been an intrinsic part of the fabric that makes up the American society. Since 2006, the U.S. accepts more legal immigrants as permanent residents than any other country in the world. That same year, a NBC/Wall Street Journal poll revealed that the U.S. public was equally divided on the whether immigration helps or hurts the country. Forty-four percent said it helped, forty-five percent said it hurt. 

However, a recent &lt;a href="w%3APew%20Research%20Center"&gt;Pew Research Center&lt;/a&gt; study suggests that the issue will remain at the forefront of the American political agenda for many years to come. 

The study revealed that by 2050, one in five Americans will be foreign-born, and the overall U.S. population will double to 438 million. The &lt;a href="w%3AHispanics_in_the_United_States"&gt;U.S Latino&lt;/a&gt; population will account for 30% of the population, while &lt;a href="w%3AAsian-Americans"&gt;Asians&lt;/a&gt; will account for 9%. Thus, what we see unfolding is a U.S. where minorities will become the majority, and drastic cultural and societal changes seem almost certain. 

The study seems to also hint that this growth is in many ways connected to legislation passed by Congress in 1965, that abolished a quota system that had nearly ended immigration from non-&lt;a href="Europe"&gt;European&lt;/a&gt; countries since the 1920s, and consequently caused an immigration surge.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Concert%20for%20peace%20held%20on%20Colombian-Venezuelan%20border&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Tens of thousands of &lt;a href="Colombia"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;ns and &lt;a href="Venezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;ns attended a free concert Sunday, held on a bridge linking the two countries. It was organized by &lt;a href="w%3AGrammy"&gt;Grammy&lt;/a&gt;-winning rock artist &lt;a href="w%3AJuanes"&gt;Juanes&lt;/a&gt; to celebrate the end of the diplomatic crisis between Colombia, Venezuela, and &lt;a href="Ecuador"&gt;Ecuador&lt;/a&gt;, and to further improve peaceful relations within the region.

The "Peace Without Borders" concert was staged atop the Simón Bolívar bridge, which connects the Colombian town of &lt;a href="w%3AC%C3%BAcuta"&gt;Cúcuta&lt;/a&gt; with the Venezuelan town of &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Antonio%20del%20T%C3%A1chira"&gt;San Antonio del Táchira&lt;/a&gt;. "It would have been much more practical and simple to do it in a city," Juanes told the &lt;a href="w%3AMiami%20Herald"&gt;Miami Herald&lt;/a&gt;, "but the border is a symbol of peace between all countries. And this message is for everyone, all the countries in Latin America and the U.S. as well."

Concert goers gathered in a dried-up riverbed to hear music by many notable Hispanic performers, including Colombian singer &lt;a href="w%3ACarlos%20Vives"&gt;Carlos Vives&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Dominican%20Republic"&gt;Dominican&lt;/a&gt; musician &lt;a href="w%3AJuan%20Luis%20Guerra"&gt;Juan Luis Guerra&lt;/a&gt;, Spanish musicians &lt;a href="w%3AMiguel%20Bos%C3%A9"&gt;Miguel Bosé&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAlejandro%20Sanz"&gt;Alejandro Sanz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Venezuela"&gt;Venezuelan&lt;/a&gt; musician &lt;a href="w%3ARicardo%20Montaner"&gt;Ricardo montaner&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AEcuador"&gt;Ecuadorian&lt;/a&gt; singer &lt;a href="w%3AJuan%20Fernando%20Velasco"&gt;Juan Fernando Velasco&lt;/a&gt;.
Juanes said the artists were "super responsive" when invited to perform. "I think they all share my feelings: How can we use our music to support this, use our art for something important?" he said.

"This is a celebration of the unity between Ecuador, Venezuela and Colombia," Carlos Vives said on the stage. "We want our police and military officers to go home," he added, referring to the Colombian hostages held by leftist group &lt;a href="w%3AFARC"&gt;FARC&lt;/a&gt;.

FARC was the center of the recent diplomatic crisis, which began when the Colombian military conducted an air raid against the organization inside Ecuador territory. Venezuela sided with Ecuador in condemning Colombia for the raid, and they each moved troops to their respective borders. The crisis was ended when the nations' leaders shook hands at a summit.

"It's not that a song by Alejandro or Carlos is going to change people," Juanes said. "But music becomes an excuse to send a message, that we're all here together building peace, that we are here as citizens and this is what we want, and we have to be heard. I think the governments have to understand and listen. We don't want to get involved in conflicts between people."

Colombian president &lt;a href="w%3AAlvaro%20Uribe"&gt;Alvaro Uribe&lt;/a&gt; had planned to attend the concert, but canceled when Juanes' manager told him the show "was not to be a political event" and asked him not to come.

According to &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; police radio communications, a woman only named as 'Hartwell,' was reported to have been kidnapped from the area of 1770 Hertel Avenue in Buffalo. 

Police stated that she is scheduled to testify in court today against an unknown party and according to an individual who called &lt;a href="w%3A9-1-1"&gt;911&lt;/a&gt;, she was kidnapped by individuals affiliated with the unknown party. 

Further communications said that she was kidnapped from near the Hertel location, then driven to the &lt;a href="w%3APeace%20Bridge"&gt;Peace Bridge&lt;/a&gt;. Police state that when they arrived on scene at the Hertel location, the individual who called 911 was receiving text messages from Hartwell stating that they had already crossed the Bridge and made it into Canada.

Further communications stated that there is no description of the vehicle that took her and the suspects descriptions are also not known. 

So far no amber alert has been issued regarding this incident.

<h1>HMAS Sydney found</h1>

The final resting place of &lt;a href="w%3AHMAS%20Sydney%20%281934%29"&gt;HMAS Sydney&lt;/a&gt; has been found. 

Ted Graham chairman of Finding Sydney Foundation said "From my point of view ... they contain the remains of many people and our firm view is that they should be left alone."

&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister Kevin Rudd confirmed at a press conference in &lt;a href="w%3ACanberra"&gt;Canberra&lt;/a&gt; this morning that the wreckage of HMAS Sydney has been found.

Mr Rudd said "The Australian Government hopes that the discovery of HMAS Sydney brings some closure to the families of the 645 Defence Force personnel who lost their lives bravely in this naval action in World War II.

"It's also a time for the nation to reflect on the bravery of all the men who gave their lives in the defence of this country in this particularly brutal and bloody engagement.

"I wish to confirm that under the Historic Shipwrecks Act, the Minister for Environment is in the process of issuing an interim protection order for both vessels." The other vessel is the &lt;a href="w%3AHSK%20Kormoran"&gt;HSK Kormoran&lt;/a&gt; which was located yesterday 112 &lt;a href="w%3Anautical%20mile"&gt;nautical miles&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3ASteep%20Point%2C%20Western%20Australia"&gt;Steep Point, Western Australia&lt;/a&gt;. HMAS Sydney is 10 nautical mile west of the Kormoran.

HMAS Sydney was sunk on November 19, 1941 by the HSK Kormoran, itself later scuttled by her crew, with the loss of all hands which has fuelled many concerns about what actually happened along with theories of Government coverups over the events. The location of the Sydney is consistent with reports from the survivors of the Kormoran.

Chief of the &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Australian%20Navy"&gt;Royal Australian Navy&lt;/a&gt;, Vice Admiral Russ Shalders says that there is more work to do in unlocking the mystery of what happened 66 years ago. 

Barbara Craill, daughter of Walter Freer who went down with the Sydney, has said "I feel there should be definitely an inquiry," saying that while the discovery closes one part of the mystery only a judicial inquiry can discover the all that happened "... because there are things that should be brought out. I mean surely we are adult enough to know that not all was well."

Monday marked &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Patrick%27s%20Day"&gt;St. Patrick's Day&lt;/a&gt;, a national holiday in &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; and a cause for celebration in many other nations.

&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;'s Irish pubs were expected to do booming business, while Sydney hosted one of the world's many St. Patrick's Day parades on Sunday.

In the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Chicago"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;'s main river was coloured green on Saturday.

A memorial to the &lt;a href="w%3AFlight%20of%20the%20Earls"&gt;Flight of the Earls&lt;/a&gt; was dedicated at &lt;a href="w%3AAndermatt"&gt;Andermatt, Switzerland&lt;/a&gt; to mark the day. Early in the 17th Century, the last of the Gaelic Earls fled Ireland for &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, travelling through Andermatt during their journey.

St. Patrick's Day parades are conducted in many regions of &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="Tokyo"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt; parade began in 1992, with this year's edition held on Sunday in the city's &lt;a href="w%3AOmotesand%C5%8D%2C%20Tokyo"&gt;Omotesandō&lt;/a&gt; neighbourhood. Elsewhere in &lt;a href="Asia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Singapore"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt; also held a St. Patrick's Day parade, this year connected with the 140th anniverary of the introduction of &lt;a href="w%3AGuinness"&gt;Guinness&lt;/a&gt; beer to that nation.

Finally from Ireland itself, nearly all of that nation's cabinet ministers will be in various nations for promotional visits. Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ABertie%20Ahern"&gt;Bertie Ahern&lt;/a&gt; was in &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; to present a bowl of &lt;a href="w%3Ashamrock"&gt;shamrocks&lt;/a&gt; to United States President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;, among other activities.

&lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; has denied the &lt;a href="w%3ADalai%20Lama"&gt;Dalai Lama&lt;/a&gt;'s accusations that the government is operating a "cultural genocide" and a "rule of terror" against the &lt;a href="Tibet"&gt;Tibetan&lt;/a&gt; people; officials called his remarks "downright nonsense" and instead asserted Tibet's culture is thriving despite the recent unrest between protesters and Chinese authorities.

"Nowadays, Tibetan people have been living a modern life while enjoying the development of traditional Tibetan culture," said Doje Cezhug, mayor of Tibet's capital &lt;a href="w%3ALhasa"&gt;Lhasa&lt;/a&gt;. "Should the Dalai separatists group not spoil [Tibet's stability], Tibet would be in its best period of development in history."

"We have 1,700 well-protected temples," said an official identified by &lt;a href="w%3AXinhua"&gt;Xinhua&lt;/a&gt; as Legqog. "Monks and the public enjoy full religious freedom."

&lt;a href="w%3ATenzin%20Gyatso"&gt;Tenzin Gyatso&lt;/a&gt;, the Dalai Lama, had condemned China's reaction to the protests, accusing the government of undermining the Tibetan people. "Whether intentionally or unintentionally, some kind of cultural genocide is taking place," he had said. "They simply rely on using force in order to simulate peace, a peace brought by force using a rule of terror." He called for an international organization to investigate the government's activities.
Meanwhile, China vowed to use harsh measures against people involved in the Lhasa riots. The Tibetan regional government has established a midnight deadline for protesters to turn themselves in to the authorities, threatening to inflict severe punishment upon those who fail to do so.

At a press conference in &lt;a href="w%3ABeijing"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt;, Tibet's governor &lt;a href="w%3AQiangba%20Puncog"&gt;Qiangba Puncog&lt;/a&gt; said, "For those people who are still active or have committed serious crimes, we will deal with them harshly. If these people can provide further information about those involved, then they could be treated more leniently."

The governor denied that Chinese security forces used lethal force against demonstrators. "I can tell you as a responsible official that guns were absolutely not fired," he said. He also said that calm was returning to Lhasa, but he added that the government has advised foreigners to stay away. Many tourists and locals have not been allowed to leave Lhasa since Friday. 
Tourists making their way out of the region gave their own reports on the violence. "There was just a massive military presence, and everything was being watched," said Danish tourist Andreas Larsen-Helms, who described the scene as "&lt;a href="w%3AOrwellian"&gt;Orwellian&lt;/a&gt;". Mary Cannesta, an American tourist visiting Lhasa, says she heard "a lot of gunfire" in the middle of the night.

The reported death tolls for the riots range from 16, China's latest figure given by Qiangba Puncog, to 80, the estimate given by the &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Tibetan%20Administration"&gt;Tibetan government in exile&lt;/a&gt;. Over the weekend, the protests against China spread to Tibetan communities in neighboring provinces, including &lt;a href="w%3ASichuan"&gt;Sichuan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AQinghai"&gt;Qinghai&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AGansu"&gt;Gansu&lt;/a&gt;.

In Sichuan's &lt;a href="w%3ANgawa%20Tibetan%20and%20Qiang%20Autonomous%20Prefecture"&gt;Ngawa prefecture&lt;/a&gt;, a witness said government troops had moved into Barkham County to stop a group of 1,000 from protesting. He said one policeman was shot and three or four police vans were set on fire. Others reported that up to 30 protesters were shot, while more reliable reports put the death toll at 7.

In Gansu's &lt;a href="w%3AXiahe%20County"&gt;Xiahe County&lt;/a&gt;, Tibetans held two protests, one considerably more peaceful than the other. On the second day of their protesting, government offices were smashed, and police arrived to throw &lt;a href="w%3Atear%20gas"&gt;tear gas&lt;/a&gt; into the crowd of over 1,000. Authorities marched through the town, which has placed under a curfew.

The unrest in China has drawn attention to the &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20Summer%20Olympics"&gt;2008 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt;, which are scheduled to occur August in Beijing. &lt;a href="w%3AJacques%20Rogge"&gt;Jacques Rogge&lt;/a&gt;, president of the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Olympic%20Committee"&gt;International Olympic Committee&lt;/a&gt;, expressed concern over the situation, but rejected the idea of boycotting the games.

The leader of the 2008 Tour de Taiwan gets a yellow jersey. But every tour winner gets assistance from a "Miss Etiquette," a tour assistant and a brand new part of the Tour de Taiwan. Miss Ettiquette has become a key feature at the awards ceremonies for every stage. Fma International Co., Ltd., the jersey sponsor of 2008 Tour de Taiwan, and a participant of the 2008 Taipei Cycle, has designed 4 different ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3Acheongsam"&gt;cheongsams&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ (&lt;a href="w%3Adress"&gt;dresses&lt;/a&gt;) for "Miss Etiquette," each matching the colors of the four leader jerseys. These cheongsam made a big hit with the Taiwanese and international media in &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;.

But what led to these champion jerseys and cheongsams? ♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ Journalist visited the booth of Fma International and interviewed Martin Hsueh-po Cheng, General Manager of Fma International, to uncover the background of their design at the 3rd Day of Taipei Cycle, just after the finish of the 7th Stage of the Tour de Taiwan (March 15).
<h2>Interview</h2>

 
Why did you cooperate with the &lt;a href="w%3AChinese%20Taipei%20Cycling%20Association"&gt;Chinese Taipei Cycling Association&lt;/a&gt; (CTCA) to design the leader jerseys and cheongsams?

♡❤♡Martin Cheng♡❤♡: We [Fma International] are proud of our sponsorship of the 2008 Tour de Taiwan. Before the race, we contacted Tour executives and in conjunction with the Taiwan Textile Research Institute (TTRI), the well-known research academy...were able to contribute a brand new material for CTCA's design. Because the Tour de Taiwan is a famous world-class competition, we can get this wonderful chance to market our brand and our design to the world.

Usually designs such as the champion cheongsam for "Miss Etiquette", are only available at world-class competitions such as the &lt;a href="w%3AOlympic%20Games"&gt;Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Games"&gt;World Games&lt;/a&gt;. Why did Fma International think to design these champion cheongsams?

♡❤♡Martin♡❤♡: The champion cheongsams, whose colors matched the four leader jerseys, are exclusively designed for the award ceremony to make these simple ceremonies more vivid and colorful... 

Before the design, did you coordinate with the CTCA on the design?

♡❤♡Martin♡❤♡: Coordination was a necessity because the design had to be approved by the &lt;a href="w%3AUnion%20Cycliste%20Internationale"&gt;Union Cycliste Internationale&lt;/a&gt;. Only after their approval, it could these designs be part of the Tour de Tawain awards ceremonies. of the race. By the way, we also did a number of alterations to customize these important champion cheongsams for each "Miss Etiquette" chosen by the CTCA.

Do you do trial runs with these new products and designs that your industry produced?

♡❤♡Martin♡❤♡: We cooperated with the TTRI for a long time on rematching and rearranging new materials when designing and did several trial runs with our newly-designed jerseys and jerseys produced with similar materials. Generally, these materials have been certified by the TTRI other some other international verification group including from Taiwan.

Other comments? Or some other significant feature?

♡❤♡Martin♡❤♡: We [the public] know that an emperor in China dressed a yellow robe to symbolize as the royalty. Originally, our company [Fma International] hoped our design would include not only our brand new fabric technology but also a traditional element, well-known as part of Taiwanese high fashion. After discussions with several senior designers, we introduced the "dragon", an animal symbolizing our traditional culture here in our &lt;a href="w%3AChinese%20language"&gt;Chinese-language&lt;/a&gt; countries, into our design and created a logo symbolic of a coiled dragon. In general, we hope this new design can be of great significance.

<h1>Adam Air hits severe financial problems; may be shut down in three weeks</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Adam%20Air%20hits%20severe%20financial%20problems%3B%20may%20be%20shut%20down%20in%20three%20weeks&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;n budget airline &lt;a href="Adam%20Air"&gt;Adam Air&lt;/a&gt; has been given a three-week ultimatum by the authorities to prove its economic stability or its license will be revoked, said Transportation Minister Jusman Djamal. This is because major financial difficulties have become apparent today, with two major shareholders pulling out of the company.

PT Global Transport Service (GTS) and Bright Star Perkasa, who between them own a 50% stake in the company, have decided to sell back all their shares to their original owners, who control the other 50%. These are the family of founder Adam Suherman and Sandra Ang. 

The companies invested in the airline last year, when the company was struggling after the New Year's Day disappearance of &lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20Air%20Flight%20574"&gt;Adam Air Flight 574&lt;/a&gt; with 102 on board. The &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing"&gt;Boeing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20737"&gt;737&lt;/a&gt; (B737) was ultimately determined to have crashed into the sea near &lt;a href="w%3ASulawesi"&gt;Sulawesi&lt;/a&gt;, and all on board are presumed dead. Shortly afterwards, &lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20Air%20Flight%20172"&gt;Adam Air Flight 172&lt;/a&gt;, another B737, snapped in half during a hard landing, but held together preventing fatalities. These were not the first serious accidents for the company, as in February 2006 Flight 782 became lost for several hours after navigation systems failed and the plane entered a radar blackspot, forcing a subsequent emergency landing many miles from the intended route. The given reasons for the withdrawal are a lack of improvement in safety and financial irregularities.

The company has now also defaulted on debt payments to aircraft lease firms, resulting in 12 of their 22 planes being seized, and has cut the number of routes served from 52 to 12. The remaining ten planes are also in default and at risk of seizure. Adam Air owes leasing companies &lt;a href="w%3AUS%24"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;14 million compared to free capital of $4.8 million of free capital. They have agreed to buy back shares gradually for $11 million (100 billion &lt;a href="w%3Arupiah"&gt;rupiah&lt;/a&gt;), $6 million less than the investment firms paid for them. The cost difference will be borne by Harry Tanoesoedibyo's family, the founder of PT Bhakti Investama, of which GTS is a wholly owned subsidiary. The companies have also lost 157 billion &lt;a href="w%3Arupiah"&gt;rupiah&lt;/a&gt; worth of investment in the company since the April 2007 deal. 9,325 Rupiah are currently worth &lt;a href="w%3AUS%24"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;1.

GTS director Gustiono Kustianto said that "Since we joined, our priority has been safety" but that Adam Air's management had been unresponsive to pressure from the new investors to improve its poor record. Last weeek another company B737 shot off the runway during landing, damaging the plane and injuring five.

Lawyer Marx Andryan of Hotman Paris Hutapea, representing the investment firms, said they have documents proving the company has not adequatly seen to pilot recruitment, maintenance and insurance.

Suherman said "We have defaulted and the investors have done nothing about it. We'll continue to operate as long as we have planes," adding that there are no current plans to declare bankruptcy.

"Out of 22 planes, now we only have 10 because 12 of them have been declared in default. The other 10 have been declared in default as well, but I'm still trying to work out a way to restructure the payments," he told ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. He went on to say that a cash injection is required, and that "There is a possibility starting on March 21 Adam Air will temporarily cease operations until there is a decision from the shareholders regarding the insurance premium."

Malkin and Sykora each had 4 points total. &lt;a href="w%3APascal%20Dupuis"&gt;Pascal Dupuis&lt;/a&gt; had 3 assists for the Penguins.
<h3>Boston Bruins @ Washington Capitals</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3ASergei%20Fedorov"&gt;Sergei Fedorov&lt;/a&gt; broke a scoreless tie with 1:18 left in the first period. &lt;a href="w%3AChuck%20Kobasew"&gt;Chuck Kobasew&lt;/a&gt; tied the score at 1-1 about halfway through the second period. The score remained tie through the rest of the game, forcing a shootout. &lt;a href="w%3AAlex%20Semin"&gt;Alex Semin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AViktor%20Kozlov"&gt;Viktor Kozlov&lt;/a&gt; each scored for Washington, while Boston was stopped on each of their shootout attempts.
<h3>Ottawa Senators @ Carolina Hurricanes</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3ADany%20Heatley"&gt;Dany Heatley&lt;/a&gt; scored the only goal for Ottawa early in the first period on a Senators power play. &lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Eaves"&gt;Patrick Eaves&lt;/a&gt; tied the score a few minutes later with a power play goal for the Hurricanes. &lt;a href="w%3AJoseph%20Corvo"&gt;Joseph Corvo&lt;/a&gt; also scored a power play goal for Carolina in the first period, giving them the lead. &lt;a href="w%3AScott%20Walker"&gt;Scott Walker&lt;/a&gt; scored in the second period for Carolina. In the third period, Corvo completed the hat trick, first with a power play goal 2:09 into the third, then again with 3:10 remaining in the game. &lt;a href="w%3AEric%20Staal"&gt;Eric Staal&lt;/a&gt; had three assists for Carolina.
<h3>Detroit Red Wings @ Columbus Blue Jackets</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3AManny%20Malhotra"&gt;Manny Malhotra&lt;/a&gt; scored first for Columbus 3:23 into the first period. &lt;a href="w%3AOle-Kristian%20Tollefsen"&gt;Ole-Kristian Tollefsen&lt;/a&gt; gave the Blue Jackets a 2 goal lead over Detroit 6:07 into the second period. Just 1:12 later, Malhotra made it a three goal game with his second of the night. &lt;a href="w%3ATomas%20Kopecky"&gt;Tomas Kopecky&lt;/a&gt; put the Red Wings on the board just under halfway through the second period. &lt;a href="w%3ANikolai%20Zherdev"&gt;Nikolai Zherdev&lt;/a&gt; scored for Columbus putting them back up by 3. &lt;a href="w%3AJohan%20Franzen"&gt;Johan Franzen&lt;/a&gt; scored a pair of power play goals to bring the Red Wings within 1, but that 1 goal lead would turn out to be enough for the Blue Jackets. Malhotra also assisted in Zherdev's goal in the second period.
<h3>Atlanta Thrashers @ Florida Panthers</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3ARadek%20Dvorak"&gt;Radek Dvorak&lt;/a&gt; scored first for Florida 2:07 into the first period. &lt;a href="w%3AOlli%20Jokinen"&gt;Olli Jokinen&lt;/a&gt; scored his 32nd goal of the season later in the first, putting the Panthers ahead by 2. &lt;a href="w%3AIlya%20Kovalchuk"&gt;Ilya Kovalchuk&lt;/a&gt; scored his 49th of the season to put the Thrashers on the board and cut Florida's lead in half. &lt;a href="w%3ARostislav%20Olesz"&gt;Rostislav Olesz&lt;/a&gt; scored a power play goal 17 seconds into the third, putting the Panthers up by 2 again.
<h3>Edmonton Oilers @ San Jose Sharks</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Marleau"&gt;Patrick Marleau&lt;/a&gt; scored a power play goal with 3:05 left in the first period. &lt;a href="w%3AAles%20Hemsky"&gt;Ales Hemsky&lt;/a&gt; tied the score 14:06 into the second period. The score remained tied to force overtime, and eventually a shootout. &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Nilsson"&gt;Robert Nilsson&lt;/a&gt; scored the first shootout goal for the Oilers in round 1, and Marleau tied it up in round three for San Jose. &lt;a href="w%3AFernando%20Pisani"&gt;Fernando Pisani&lt;/a&gt; scored in the fourth round, giving the Oilers the win, and snapping San Jose's 11 game winning streak.

&lt;a href="Mexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;'s main opposition party, the leftist &lt;a href="w%3AParty%20of%20the%20Democratic%20Revolution"&gt;Party of the Democratic Revolution&lt;/a&gt; (PRD), voted for its new leader Sunday. Preliminary results received on Monday indicate that the election was won by &lt;a href="w%3AAlejandro%20Encinas%20Rodr%C3%ADguez"&gt;Alejandro Encinas Rodríguez&lt;/a&gt;, former &lt;a href="w%3AHead%20of%20Government%20of%20the%20Federal%20District"&gt;Head of Government of the Federal District&lt;/a&gt;.

The party's Electoral Committee cited figures given by polling group Consulta Mitofsky, which showed Encinas with 49.4 percent of vote and his main opponent, &lt;a href="w%3AJes%C3%BAs%20Ortega"&gt;Jesús Ortega Martínez&lt;/a&gt;, with 44.6 percent. Although official results won't be released until Wednesday, much of the country's media has already declared Encinas the winner. 

Roy Campos, president of Consulta Mitofsky, said that Encinas would remain in the lead after the rest of the votes were counted.
"The trend is very clear," Encinas said in a television interview.

Sunday's vote was split between those who strongly oppose &lt;a href="w%3AFelipe%20Calder%C3%B3n"&gt;Felipe Calderón&lt;/a&gt;'s presidency, like Encinas, and party moderates who favor negotiating with the government, like Ortega. The party has been this way ever since the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Mexican%20presidential%20election"&gt;2006 presidential election&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href="w%3AAndres%20Manuel%20Lopez%20Obrador"&gt;Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador&lt;/a&gt; contested the results, believing he had defeated Calderón, and declared himself the "legitimate" president. 

Encinas, who once served in Obrador's cabinet and doesn't recognize Calderón as president, said the party needs "a very important redesign" to avoid these kinds of disputes. Both sides accused the other of voting irregularities in Sunday's election, including vote-buying, intimidation, and improper handling of ballots.

&lt;a href="w%3ANotimex"&gt;Notimex&lt;/a&gt;, the government news agency, reported that a fight broke out at one polling place in Mexico City, and that several other stations had to be shut down.

In the extent of 7 years of its life, the Russian Wikipedia has become the largest &lt;a href="w%3ARussian%20Language"&gt;Russian Language&lt;/a&gt; encyclopedia of all time, as well as the largest in the &lt;a href="w%3ARunet"&gt;Runet&lt;/a&gt; (Russian-spoken Internet). The closest printed rival is the Terra (“&lt;a href="w%3Aru%3A%D0%91%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C%D1%88%D0%B0%D1%8F%20%D1%8D%D0%BD%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B8%D1%8F%20%C2%AB%D0%A2%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%80%D0%B0%C2%BB"&gt;Терра&lt;/a&gt;”) encyclopedia published in 2006 which features 160 000 articles in 62 volumes. It is followed by 1906 &lt;a href="w%3ABrockhaus%20and%20Efron%20Encyclopedic%20Dictionary"&gt;Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary&lt;/a&gt; which has 121 240 articles in 31 volumes.

Russian Wikipedians estimate that around 30 thousand people participated in one or another way in the ru-wiki so far. Russian Wikipedia is now a major source of information for Russian-speaking people: a poll indicated it recently to be 12th most visited site within the Runet, another poll of about 1000 people found out 32% of them were considering Wikipedia a crucial informational tool. During last February (2008) there were over 4.8 million hits to ru-wiki's main page registered (about 165 thousand per day).

Russian language Wikipedia is the 11th in quantity amongst other language ones, 13th in the number of participants and the 5th in in 100 000+ category, says the press release.

Minnesota returns to the top of the Northwest division standings. &lt;a href="w%3ANiklas%20Backstrom"&gt;Niklas Backstrom&lt;/a&gt; made 29 saves for the Wild, and improves his record to 28-13-7. Burns had two points, also assisting on Radivojevic's goal. 
<h3>Phoenix Coyotes @ Vancouver Canucks</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3AHenrik%20Sedin"&gt;Henrik Sedin&lt;/a&gt; scored first for the Canucks 8:55 into the first period. &lt;a href="w%3ATaylor%20Pyatt"&gt;Taylor Pyatt&lt;/a&gt; scored a power play goal a few minutes later to put Vancouver up by 2 goals. &lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Carcillo"&gt;Daniel Carcillo&lt;/a&gt; scored his 8th goal of the season to bring the Coyotes within 1 goal, but Vancouver retook a 2 goal lead late in the second period with Henrik's second of the night. &lt;a href="w%3ARoberto%20Luongo"&gt;Roberto Luongo&lt;/a&gt; gave up just one goal in 26 shots, earning his 33rd win of the season. The Sedin twins each had two point nights; &lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Sedin"&gt;Daniel&lt;/a&gt; assisted his brother Henrik in each of his goals. &lt;a href="w%3ASami%20Salo"&gt;Sami Salo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Bieksa"&gt;Kevin Bieksa&lt;/a&gt; also had two assists each.
<h2>Player of the Day</h2>

Today's Player of the Day is Henrik Sedin of the Vancouver Canucks. Henrik scored two of Vancouver's three goals in their 3-1 win over the Phoenix Coyotes. His goals were the first non-empty-net goals he's scored since February 9, and this game was his first multi-goal game since November 9, 2007.

&lt;a href="w%3ATenzin%20Gyatso"&gt;Tenzin Gyatso&lt;/a&gt;, the 14th &lt;a href="w%3ADalai%20Lama"&gt;Dalai Lama&lt;/a&gt;, has vowed to step down from his position if things "get out of control" in &lt;a href="Tibet"&gt;Tibet&lt;/a&gt;, where violent demonstrations against &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; have killed anywhere from 13 to 100 people.

At a news conference in &lt;a href="w%3ADharamsala"&gt;Dharamsala&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, the Dalai Lama said he was opposed to the use of violence against China's rule. "Violence is almost suicide," he said. "Even if 1,000 Tibetans sacrifice their lives, it will not help." However, he acknowledges that many radical Tibetans have criticized his policy of non-violence, and says that his only option is to "completely resign" if the bloodshed continues. 

After making these statements, his secretary Tenzin Taklha said it would be impossible for him to resign as Tibet's spiritual leader, and that he will only be able to resign as their political leader. "If the Tibetans were to choose the path of violence, he would have to resign because he is completely committed to nonviolence," Taklha said. "He would resign as the political leader and head of state, but not as the Dalai Lama. He will always be the Dalai Lama."

The Dalai Lama responded to accusations made by China's premier, &lt;a href="w%3AWen%20Jiabao"&gt;Wen Jiabao&lt;/a&gt;, who said there was evidence proving that the riots were "organised, premeditated, masterminded and incited by the Dalai clique". The Dalai Lama asked Chinese officials to come to his headquarters in Dharamsala and investigate. "Check our various offices," he said. "They can examine my pulse, my urine, my stool, everything."

He also suggested that the Chinese themselves may have orchestrated the protests as a way to discredit him. "It's possible some Chinese agents are involved there," the Dalai Lama said. "Sometimes totalitarian regimes are very clever, so it is important to investigate."

Wen Jiabao's remarks came at an annual news conference at the end of China's national legislative session. He said the intent of the riots was to "undermine the &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20Summer%20Olympics"&gt;Beijing Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt;" and "serve their hidden agenda". He added, "This has all the more revealed that the consistent claims made by the Dalai clique that they pursue not independence but peaceful dialogue are nothing but lies."

Wen said China will be open to negotiation with the Dalai Lama if he recognizes Tibet and &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; as "inalienable parts of the Chinese territory". The Dalai Lama responded by inviting Wen to speak with him. "If the Chinese side ... accepts the reality and addresses the Tibetan problem realistically, within a few hours we can solve this problem," he said.
Although China suspects the Dalai Lama and his followers wish to break away from Chinese control, Tenzin Gyatso said that "independence is out of the question" and instead advocated greater autonomy within China. "We should not develop anti-Chinese feelings," he said. "We must live together side by side."

He said he plans to meet with Tibetan exiles who are currently marching from India to Lhasa, as he believes their ambitions to be futile. "Will you get independence? What's the use?" he asked, calling for them to stop at the border.

Meanwhile, China continued with efforts to arrest those involved in the &lt;a href="w%3ALhasa"&gt;Lhasa&lt;/a&gt; demonstrations, after a midnight deadline for protesters to turn themselves in passed without any apparent surrenders. Witnesses reported 4 army trucks carrying off dozens of handcuffed prisoners. Urgen Tenzin, executive director of the Tibetan Center for Human Rights and Democracy, said about 600 Tibetans were arrested Monday.

Police were seen patrolling the streets of Lhasa, carrying batons or rifles and checking for identification papers. "When the fighting began, you saw no Chinese," said John Kenwood, a Canadian tourist. "Now you see no Tibetans on the streets. The young Tibetans are probably hiding."

The protests, which began in &lt;a href="w%3ALhasa"&gt;Lhasa&lt;/a&gt;, have since spread to neighboring provinces. In &lt;a href="w%3AAba%2C%20Sichuan"&gt;Aba&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASichuan"&gt;Sichuan&lt;/a&gt;, one witness reported 17 deaths. "Earlier today, the whole town was teeming with police and soldiers," he said. "All the shops have been closed. There are no arrests that I know of ... People are anticipating that something big is going to happen." Elsewhere in Sichuan, thousands of Tibetans turned out in the streets of &lt;a href="w%3ASeda"&gt;Seda&lt;/a&gt;, according to the Tibetan Center for Human Rights and Democracy. 

The international community has repeatedly urged China to use restraint in dealing with protesters, and to start talks with the Dalai Lama. &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; Secretary of State &lt;a href="w%3ACondoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; said on Monday, "We have really urged the Chinese over several years to find a way to talk with the Dalai Lama, who is a figure of authority, who is not a separatist, and to find a way to engage him and bring his moral weight to a more sustainable and better solution of the Tibet issue."

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Indonesia%20grounds%20Adam%20Air%3B%20may%20be%20permanently%20shut%20down%20in%20three%20months&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; has suspended the operating license of PT Adam Skyconnection Airlines, who trade as &lt;a href="Adam%20Air"&gt;Adam Air&lt;/a&gt;, over safety concerns. The airline has recently suffered safety problems and financial difficulty.

Formed in 2003, Adam Air hit financial crisis on Monday when two major shareholders, investment companies who control 50% of the airline, announced they were pulling out and selling all shares back to the original owners, who still control the other half. The reasons given were a lack of improvement in safety and alleged financial mismanagement.

The shares were bought after two major accidents hit the budget carrier last year. On New Year's day &lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20Air%20Flight%20574"&gt;Adam Air Flight 574&lt;/a&gt; disapeared and was found to have crashed into the ocean near &lt;a href="w%3ASulawesi"&gt;Sulawesi&lt;/a&gt;, leaving 102 missing and presumed dead. Shortly afterwards, another company aircraft snapped in half during landing, but fatalities were prevented because the compromised airframe held together. Both were &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing"&gt;Boeing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20737"&gt;737&lt;/a&gt; (B737) aircraft. At the airline's height, it operated 22 of these, serving domestic routes across the Indonesian archipelago and daily international flights to &lt;a href="Malaysia"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Singapore"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt;.

Adam Air also had a serious incident in early 2006, when all navigational systems on a B737 failed, causing the plane to inadvertently enter an accident blackspot. The aircraft was lost for several hours before performing an emergency landing hundreds of miles from its intended destination.

On March 10, another Adam Air B737 overshot the runway during landing at &lt;a href="w%3ABatam"&gt;Batam&lt;/a&gt; island's airport. Since then, Adam Air has been issued two deadlines in rapid succession by the authorities - one to solve safety issues, and one to prove its financial viability. They have cut routes from 52 to 12, and defaulted on all payments on their aircraft to the leasing companies, who have seized back 12 of them.

Gustiono Kustianto, director of one of the two leasing companies, said the carrier's "life expectancy is less than a month," and that it owes &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;14 million to leasing companies compared to $4.8 million of free capital.

Aviation director general Budhi Mulyawan Suyitno said that Adam Air had been grounded due to inadequate Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) standards and poor pilot training. He said that investigations into last week's crash, which injured five people and severely damaged the aircraft, had revealed "the pilot had no idea what to do in an emergency situation." The airline will spend three months grounded, after which it will be shut down entirely if it does not show it has improved.

"The Transport Ministry has decided to revoke Adam Air's operational specification, effective 12am Wednesday (4am AEDT),♡❤ said Suyitno. "With this, Adam Air is banned from operating its aircraft. All of its planes must be automatically grounded." He commented that a quarterly evaluation had uncovered "violations that could put passengers' safety at risk".

The news coincides with a two-day ultimatum from Adam Air's insurance provider. Failure to pay the insurance premiums would also have resulted in grounding.

Founder Adam Suherman - whose family owns half the airline alongside Sandra Ang - commented today that the situation with the shareholders had demoralised pilots. "That in turn would affect their performance. It is very dangerous." He also said that he was not surprised Adam Air had been grounded. Yesterday, he said that there were no plans to file for bankruptcy.

His immediate reaction to the news from the insurance - which preceded the grounding by several hours - was that his airline likely could not insure the entire fleet, saying "There have been warnings from the insurance companies... Because every aircraft that is in operation must be insured, the operational activities will be temporarily suspended until there is a further decision from shareholders."

Adam Air's 2007 accidents, coupled with &lt;a href="w%3AGaruda%20Indonesia"&gt;Garuda Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; , sparked an industry review that determined none of the nation's air carriers were safe. The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; subsequently warned against using Indonesian airlines, and they were all added to the &lt;a href="w%3Alist%20of%20air%20carriers%20banned%20in%20the%20EU"&gt;list of air carriers banned in the EU&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>NASA: Old Arctic sea ice continues to melt</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=NASA%3A%20Old%20Arctic%20sea%20ice%20continues%20to%20melt&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="NASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; has stated that recent satellite images have shown that despite an unusually cold winter in the &lt;a href="w%3AArctic"&gt;Arctic&lt;/a&gt;, the old or perennial ice on both the &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Pole"&gt;North&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Pole"&gt;South Poles&lt;/a&gt; has continued to melt while the level of 'new ice' has increased as compared to last March.

On March 18 the scientists said they believe that the increased area of sea ice this winter is due to recent weather conditions, while the decline in perennial ice reflects the longer-term warming climate trend and is a result of increased melting during summer and greater movement of the older ice out of the Arctic.

According to NASA-processed microwave data, whereas perennial ice used to cover 50-60 percent of the Arctic, this year it covers less than 30 percent. Very old ice that remains in the Arctic for at least six years comprised over 20 percent of the Arctic area in the mid to late 1980s, but this winter it decreased to just six percent.

"Although this March the area is slightly larger than last March, the area of [thick] perennial ice has reached an all time low. So the volume of Arctic ice continues to decrease," said NASA's Cryospheric Sciences Program manager Seelye Martin.

Arctic sea ice grows and declines seasonally, ranging from an average minimum extent in September of 2.5 million square miles (6.5 million squeare km) to an average winter maximum extent of 5.9 million square miles (15.3 million square km) in March. This March, instruments on NASA’s &lt;a href="w%3AAqua%20%28satellite%29"&gt;Aqua satellite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Oceanic%20and%20Atmospheric%20Administration"&gt;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&lt;/a&gt; (NOAA) and the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense"&gt;Defense Department&lt;/a&gt; satellites showed the maximum sea ice extent slightly increased by 3.9 percent over that of the previous three years, but it is still below the long-term average by 2.2 percent. Increases in ice extent occurred in areas where surface temperatures were colder than the historical averages. At the same time, as a result of the export of ice from the Arctic, the area of perennial ice decreased to an all-time minimum.

Joey Comiso of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., the lead author of a 2007 related study, used data from NASA's passive microwave data set to establish that the perennial ice cover at the summer Arctic ice minimum in 2007 was about 40 percent less than the 28-year average. According to the latest observations from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (an organization partially funded by NASA), perennial sea ice dropped from about 40 percent of the total ice pack last year to 30 percent of total ice this winter. The perennial ice is also growing younger, meaning that it is thinner and will be more vulnerable during the summer melt period.

According to Walt Meier of the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Snow%20and%20Ice%20Data%20Center"&gt;National Snow and Ice Data Center&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Colorado%2C%20Boulder"&gt;University of Colorado, Boulder&lt;/a&gt;, as ice ages it continues to grow and thicken, so that older ice is generally also thicker ice. This winter the ice cover is much thinner overall and thus in a more vulnerable state heading into the summer melt season.

"It's becoming thinner and thinner and much more susceptible to melting during the summer - much more likely to melt away. It may look OK on the surface, but it's like looking at a Hollywood movie set - you see the facade of a building and it looks OK, but if you look behind it, there's no building there," said Meier.

NASA’s &lt;a href="w%3AICESat"&gt;ICESat&lt;/a&gt; satellite has contributed to understanding of the changes in ice thickness. To get a better understanding of the behavior of sea ice, NASA is planning a follow-on satellite mission, ICESat II, to launch in 2015.

<h1>Barack Obama gives speech on racial division</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Barack%20Obama%20gives%20speech%20on%20racial%20division&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; presidential candidate &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; today gave a speech concerning racial division, which has become a major issue in his campaign after his former pastor's racially-charged statements were widely reported in the media last week.

The 37-minute speech, which Obama's advisers say was written by Barack himself, was delivered at the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Constitution%20Center"&gt;National Constitution Center&lt;/a&gt;, a history museum in &lt;a href="w%3APhiladelphia"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Pennsylvania"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;. It was broadcast live on national television. 

Obama said Rev. &lt;a href="w%3AJeremiah%20Wright"&gt;Jeremiah Wright&lt;/a&gt;'s statements "expressed a profoundly distorted view of this country – a view that sees white racism as endemic, and that elevates what is wrong with America above all that we know is right with America". In one of Wright's more controversial sermons, he said blacks should damn America for mistreating and ignoring them.

"Reverend Wright’s comments were not only wrong but divisive, divisive at a time when we need unity; racially charged at a time when we need to come together to solve a set of monumental problems," Obama said.

However, Obama says he will continue to embrace his former pastor, if not his words. "I can no more disown him than I can disown the black community," he said. "I can no more disown him than I can my white grandmother ... a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed by her on the street ... These people are a part of me. And they are a part of America, this country that I love."
Obama, the son of a &lt;a href="Kenya"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt;n man and a white woman, discussed how his race has affected his campaign. "On one end of the spectrum, we’ve heard the implication that my candidacy is somehow an exercise in affirmative action; that it’s based solely on the desire of wide-eyed liberals to purchase racial reconciliation on the cheap," he said. 

"On the other end, we’ve heard my former pastor, Reverend Jeremiah Wright, use incendiary language to express views that have the potential not only to widen the racial divide, but views that denigrate both the greatness and the goodness of our nation".

He also discussed the larger issue of race, and said that it is still an issue in the United States. "The anger is real," he said, referring to the anger expressed by Wright and other blacks. "It is powerful, and to simply wish it away, to condemn it without understanding its roots, only serves to widen the chasm of misunderstanding that exists between the races." 

He also mentioned the resentment felt by many whites because of &lt;a href="w%3AWelfare%20%28financial%20aid%29"&gt;welfare&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aaffirmative%20action"&gt;affirmative action&lt;/a&gt;. Though he says this resentment has often distracted America from the real problems whites and others face, he said that to label it as misguided or racist would only "widen the racial divide".

Obama described the current state of racial affairs in America as a "stalemate we’ve been stuck in for years", but he says he has a conviction that "we can move beyond some of our old racial wounds" and "continue on the path of a more perfect union". 

&lt;a href="Hillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, also campaigning in Philadelphia, gave a positive comment about Barack's speech. "Issues of race and gender in America have been complicated throughout our history, and they are complicated in this primary campaign," said Clinton. "There have been detours and pitfalls along the way, but we should remember that this is a historic moment for the Democratic Party and for our country. We will be nominating the first African-American or woman for the presidency of the United States, and that is something that all Americans can and should celebrate."

The Internet's reaction to Obama's speech was immediate and pronounced. Adam Whittaker, a blogger from &lt;a href="w%3ABrooklyn"&gt;Brooklyn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, posted a supportive comment on Obama's campaign site. "Obama went straight to the wound today," he wrote, "but he didn't go with a bottle of acid or with the intentions to open the wound deeper. He went to the wound with precision and healing power of a surgeon, and he even sewed a stitch to begin the healing."

A user from &lt;a href="w%3AYukon%2C%20Oklahoma"&gt;Yukon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Oklahoma"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt; named Brint said, "Here we have a man who is half black, half white; a man who has experienced and embodies the concerns shared by both sides in racism, speaking frankly and intelligently on the issue."

Others were not so supportive. One &lt;a href="w%3AYouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; user questioned why Obama had stayed close to Wright for so long. "His words are not enough - he should have taken action years ago," the user commented. "There's no room in this world for Wright's divisive teachings, and his financial and spiritual support of them over 20 years does not help his electability. 

Another user wrote, "Actions speak louder than words and Obama sat and listened to hate for a long time. Not even one of his great speeches can erase that."

Still other observers argued that the controversy over Obama's former pastor was merely a distraction from the real issues that confront the American people: How to revive a sinking economy, end an unpopular war, and curb global warming. 

"I'm more concerned with what Obama, Clinton, or McCain will do about jobs, education, global warming, the war, and the national debt than I am about this phony issue," one voter said after listening to the speech. "This whole controversy was started by right-wingers trying to use race to divide us again."

&lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; expatriate science fiction author, futurist, and visionary &lt;a href="w%3AArthur%20C.%20Clarke"&gt;Arthur C. Clarke&lt;/a&gt; died on Wednesday in a hospital in his adopted hometown of &lt;a href="w%3AColombo"&gt;Colombo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Sri%20Lanka"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;. He was 90 years old.

"Sir Arthur passed away a short while ago at the Apollo Hospital. He had been in hospital for the past four days. He had been in and out of the hospital in recent weeks," said Clarke's assistant, Rohan de Silva. 

Reports say that after a long 50 year battle with post-&lt;a href="w%3Apolio"&gt;polio&lt;/a&gt; syndrome, Clarke died at 1:30 a.m. (local time) on Wednesday from breathing complications.

Famous for writing over 100 &lt;a href="w%3Ascience%20fiction"&gt;science fiction&lt;/a&gt; and science publications, including ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3A2001%3A%20A%20Space%20Odyssey"&gt;2001: A Space Odyssey&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, he is also credited as the one who presented the concept of the &lt;a href="w%3Ageostationary%20satellites"&gt;geostationary communication satellite&lt;/a&gt;.

"Sometimes I am asked how I would like to be remembered. I have had a diverse career as a writer, underwater explorer and space promoter. Of all these I would like to be remembered as a writer," said Clarke not long before he died.

&lt;a href="w%3ABertie%20Ahern"&gt;Bertie Ahern&lt;/a&gt;, the Prime Minister of Ireland visited the &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; Monday to commemorate &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Patrick%27s%20Day"&gt;St. Patrick's Day&lt;/a&gt;. Mr. Ahern makes this visit annually, for what he calls a "very substantial and useful meeting." Mr. Ahern started his speech by saying "Mr. President and Mrs. Bush, thank you for the welcome and honor which you've extended to our delegation, and to all the Irish guests, from North and from South, who are here at the White House this morning to mark St. Patrick's Day, Ireland's National Day. I'm very grateful, Mr. President, for the opportunity which we have just had to hold a very substantial and useful meeting with you in the Oval Office. We appreciate it, and we appreciate the amount of time that you've given to us."

Mr. Bush commented on the relationship between the US and Ireland, saying that "we've [the US and Ireland have] had a long relationship, Taoiseach. Our history has been one where the United States and Ireland have made liberty our common cause, and both of our nations are richer for it. Our partnership is based upon principles, and it's also based upon people. Ireland founded itself -- found itself in the grip of poverty and famine in the 19th century, and millions of Irish came here to our soil. They were drawn here by a promise that success would be attainable to all those who were willing to work hard. And that's certainly what happened."

"And that's what we celebrate on St. Patrick's Day. Our countries are more than just partners, we are family, Taoiseach. And today more than 35 million Americans claim Irish ancestry. America is richer for every Murphy, Kelly, and O'Sullivan. I should have said McCain -- Well, I just did. After all, this history together, the United States and the Republic of Ireland continue to stand side by side in firm friendship. We were friends in the past, we're friends today, and, Taoiseach, I am confident, after my time in office, the next President will be friends with Ireland. We are cooperating to build prosperous economies and vibrant trade and sound investment between our countries," continued Mr. Bush. The mentions of McCain in this article were both followed by laughter and applause from the audience.

Mr. Ahern also commented on the resolution to the conflicts that had been troubling Ireland for many years. He said that "we [the people of Ireland] are all glad to say, and enormously pleased and proud to stand here and say that we've achieved peace in Ireland. It's a peace that I firmly believe will endure to future generations."

The DNC's rules currently allow early primaries to be held in only four states: &lt;a href="Iowa"&gt;Iowa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Nevada"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20Hampshire"&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="South%20Carolina"&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;. 

The appellate court's decision could take more than a month. Whichever way this court decides, the losing party is expected to petition the U.S. Supreme Court to review the question.

Meanwhile, a furor is brewing inside the Democratic Party over what will be done with the delegates representing the voters of Florida and &lt;a href="Michigan"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt;. Schemes to offer an inexpensive mail-in revote in Florida have been abandoned by the Florida Democratic Party as being at risk of vote tampering. 

A plan to distribute Florida's delegates among the candidates was proposed Wednesday by Florida state senators &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASteven%20Gelleras"&gt;Steven Gelleras&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and Jeremy Ring. The plan recommends seating half of Florida's 210 delegates based on the votes cast in Florida's primary. Their remaining delegates could be allocated evenly or in proportion to each candidate's national tally.

The Michigan legislature was considering a re-run of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMichigan%20Democratic%20primary"&gt;Michigan Democratic primary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for June 3rd but &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; questioned the legality of the planned vote. The Michigan legislature adjourned for spring recess today (Thursday) before reaching a decision which has effectively ended the possibility of a re-vote on June 3rd. Last minute deals are still possible but the re-ballot would have to occur before June 10 to comply with DNC rules.

&lt;a href="Croatia"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Bulgaria"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Hungary"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt;, all of which border &lt;a href="Serbia"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt;, announced in a joint statement Wednesday that they will recognize &lt;a href="Kosovo"&gt;Kosovo&lt;/a&gt; as an independent state.

"The decision on the recognition of Kosovo is based on thorough consideration," the statement said. 

Croatia and Hungary later confirmed they had officially recognized Kosovo, while Bulgaria is expected to make an announcement Thursday. Yesterday, Bulgaria's security council held a meeting regarding Kosovo. Angel Naidenov, spokesman of the &lt;a href="w%3ABulgarian%20Socialist%20Party"&gt;Bulgarian Socialist Party&lt;/a&gt;, praised Kosovo for their efforts in establishing a "multi-ethnic and democratic country."

The statement says Kosovo's declaration of independence was prompted by the international community's failure to work out a solution between Serbia and Kosovo. "In these circumstances the change of the unsustainable status quo was unavoidable," the statement said.

The three nations express their interest in helping the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; with stabilizing the region, and they wish to develop ties with a Kosovo that "maintains good relations with its neighbors, enjoys economic growth, and keeps its European orientation."

Serbian foreign minister &lt;a href="w%3AVuk%20Jeremi%C4%87"&gt;Vuk Jeremić&lt;/a&gt; criticized their decision. "Every country that decides to recognize the illegally declared state of Kosovo breaches international law," he said, adding that countries who recognize Kosovo "cannot have good ties with Serbia." 

"I call on states, particularly those of the region, not to take this step. Do not injure our country's territorial integrity and sovereignty," Jeremić said.

&lt;a href="w%3ABoris%20Tadi%C4%87"&gt;Boris Tadić&lt;/a&gt;, Serbia's president, had previously warned Croatia that recognizing Kosovo would have a negative effect on their relations. "We want to have the best possible relations with this country," Tadić said. "But recognition of Kosovo is certainly not an act of goodwill between neighbours."

Croatian Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AIvo%20Sanader"&gt;Ivo Sanader&lt;/a&gt; says he does not expect relations to worsen. "I do understand this is a difficult one for Serbia to swallow. That's one of the reasons we have waited until now. But I don't expect a worsening of political and economic relations because there is no alternative to good neighbourly relations."

Kosovo's deputy prime minister, &lt;a href="w%3AHajredin%20Ku%C3%A7i"&gt;Hajredin Kuçi&lt;/a&gt; said the decision was "very good for the Serbian perception and the people of Serbia that everybody who is in the neighbourhood is recognizing the new reality."

&lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; delivered today a speech regarding &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; and the "global war on terror." Bush claimed that the war in Iraq had been successful. He said that "removing &lt;a href="w%3ASaddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt; from power was the right decision — and this is a fight America can and must win." The speech marked five years since the start of the &lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20War"&gt;Iraq War&lt;/a&gt;.

Bush said that "five years into this battle [the war in Iraq], there is an understandable debate over whether the war was worth fighting, whether the fight is worth winning, and whether we can win it. The answers are clear to me: Removing Saddam Hussein from power was the right decision — and this is a fight America can and must win." He continued saying that "The men and women who crossed into Iraq five years ago removed a tyrant, liberated a country, and rescued millions from unspeakable horrors. Some of those troops are with us today, and you need to know that the American people are proud of your accomplishment -- and so is the Commander in Chief." This was followed by applause from the audience. 

Bush also praised the troops who worked in Iraq. He said that "operation Iraqi Freedom was a remarkable display of military effectiveness. Forces from the &lt;a href="UK"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Poland"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; and other allies joined our troops in the initial operations. As they advanced, our troops fought their way through sand storms so intense that they blackened the daytime sky. Our troops engaged in pitched battles with the &lt;a href="w%3AFedayeen%20Saddam"&gt;Fedayeen Saddam&lt;/a&gt; — death squads acting on the orders of Saddam Hussein that obeyed neither the conventions of war nor the dictates of conscience. These death squads hid in schools and they hid in hospitals, hoping to draw fire against Iraqi civilians. They used women and children as human shields. They stopped at nothing in their efforts to prevent us from prevailing — but they couldn't stop the coalition advance."

In the speech, the Iraqi elections were also mentioned. Bush said that "over the past five years, we have seen moments of triumph and moments of tragedy. We have watched in admiration as 12 million Iraqis defied the terrorists and went to the polls, and chose their leaders in free elections. We have watched in horror as &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; beheaded innocent captives, and sent suicide bombers to blow up mosques and markets. These actions show the brutal nature of the enemy in Iraq. And they serve as a grim reminder: The terrorists who murder the innocent in the streets of Baghdad want to murder the innocent in the streets of America. Defeating this enemy in Iraq will make it less likely that we'll face the enemy here at home."

Bush claimed success in Iraq when he said that "the successes we are seeing in Iraq are undeniable — yet some in Washington still call for retreat. War critics can no longer credibly argue that we're losing in Iraq — so now they argue the war costs too much. In recent months we've heard exaggerated estimates of the costs of this war. No one would argue that this war has not come at a high cost in lives and treasure — but those costs are necessary when we consider the cost of a strategic victory for our enemies in Iraq."

Bush concluded the speech by saying that "The best way we can honor them [the US troops] is by making sure that their sacrifice was not in vain. Five years ago tonight, I promised the American people that in the struggle ahead, we will accept no outcome but victory. Today, standing before men and women who helped liberate a nation, I reaffirm the commitment. The battle in Iraq is noble, it is necessary, and it is just. And with your courage, the battle in Iraq will end in victory. God bless."

♡❤Wikinews♡❤ held an exclusive interview with author and filmmaker John Gaspard. His films ♡❤Resident Alien♡❤, ♡❤Beyond Bob♡❤ and ♡❤Grown Men♡❤, besides opening to positive critical response, were all made on very low budgets; costing around &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;30,000. He says this is because "I despise the process of trying to raise money to finance movies."

He has also written several books on filmmaking, most notably ♡❤Digital Filmmaking 101♡❤. He says that it was "originally...a series of notes to ourselves, to remind us of the steps we took to make a feature for very little money. We later expanded those notes into a complete book to provide beginning filmmakers with the tools they would need to make a feature for what most Hollywood films spend on coffee and rolls."

Gaspard has written two other books as well. ♡❤Fast, Cheap and Under Control: Lessons Learned From the Greatest Low-Budget Movie of All Time♡❤ features interviews with some of the world's most well known low budget filmmakers, including &lt;a href="w%3AB-movie"&gt;B-movie&lt;/a&gt; king &lt;a href="w%3ARoger%20Corman"&gt;Roger Corman&lt;/a&gt; and actor-turned-director &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Noonan"&gt;Tom Noonan&lt;/a&gt;. ♡❤Fast, Cheap and Written that Way: Top Screenwriters on Writing for Low-Budget Movies♡❤ features interviews with successful screenwriters who have written for low budget films.

The planet closely orbits &lt;a href="w%3AHD%20189733"&gt;HD 189733&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3Ayellow%20dwarf"&gt;yellow dwarf&lt;/a&gt; star in the constellation &lt;a href="w%3AVulpecula"&gt;Vulpecula&lt;/a&gt;.

Although methane can play a key role in the chemical reactions needed to form life, the planet is too close to its parent star to support life, scientists say. It is known as a "&lt;a href="w%3Ahot%20Jupiter"&gt;hot Jupiter&lt;/a&gt;" - a planet whose mass is comparable to that of Jupiter, but orbits nearer to the parent star than &lt;a href="w%3AMercury%20%28planet%29"&gt;Mercury&lt;/a&gt;, our Solar System's innermost planet. 

This particular hot Jupiter takes just two days to completely orbit its parent star, and the temperatures in its atmosphere can reach 1,650 degrees Fahrenheit, around the melting point of &lt;a href="w%3Asilver"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt;.
"The methane here, although we can call it an organic constituent, is not produced by life - it is way too hot there for life," said Giovanna Tinetti, part of the NASA team that made the discovery.

However, scientists believe the &lt;a href="w%3Aspectroscopy"&gt;spectroscopic&lt;/a&gt; methods used to detect the methane can be used to find organic compounds on other distant planets. "This observation is proof that spectroscopy can eventually be done on a cooler and potentially habitable Earth-sized planet orbiting a dimmer red dwarf-type star," said Mark Swain, a NASA scientist whose paper on the discovery will appear in the scientific journal ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANature%20%28journal%29"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

Spectroscopy is the splitting of light into its components. As the light from the star passed through the planet's atmosphere, the atmospheric gases imprinted their chemical signature onto the light, allowing the atmosphere's chemical composition to be analyzed by &lt;a href="w%3ANear%20Infrared%20Camera%20and%20Multi-Object%20Spectrometer"&gt;Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer&lt;/a&gt;.

To their surprise, astronomers found much higher levels of methane than had been predicted for hot Jupiters. "This indicates we don't really understand exoplanet atmospheres yet," said Swain.

This discovery also confirmed the presence of water molecules in the planet's atmosphere, which was found by NASA's &lt;a href="w%3ASpitzer%20Space%20Telescope"&gt;Spitzer Space Telescope&lt;/a&gt; last year using spectroscopy. "With this observation there is no question whether there is water or not - water is present," Swain said.

The ultimate goal of these studies is to identify the molecules of more &lt;a href="w%3AEarth"&gt;Earth&lt;/a&gt;-like planets in the &lt;a href="w%3Ahabitable%20zone"&gt;habitable zone&lt;/a&gt; of stars, where conditions may be favorable for life. 

Adam Showman at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Arizona"&gt;University of Arizona&lt;/a&gt; said, "We are thus now seeing but the opening salvo in a revolution that will extend humankind's view of planetary worlds far beyond the provincial boundaries of our Solar System."

Giovanna Tinetti, who co-authored the ♡❤Nature♡❤ article, believes the concept of life on other planets is not too unlikely. "My personal view is it is way too arrogant to think that we are the only ones living in the Universe," she says.

A &lt;a href="w%3ASea%20Launch"&gt;Sea Launch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AZenit%20rocket"&gt;Zenit-3SL&lt;/a&gt; rocket has successfully launched the &lt;a href="w%3ADirecTV-11"&gt;DirecTV-11&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACommunications%20satellite"&gt;Communications satellite&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="w%3ADirecTV"&gt;DirecTV&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="Ukraine"&gt;Ukrainian&lt;/a&gt;-built rocket lifted off from the &lt;a href="Norway"&gt;Norwegian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AOcean%20Odyssey"&gt;Ocean Odyssey&lt;/a&gt; launch platform in the &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Ocean"&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt; at 22:47:59 (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;) yesterday evening, with spacecraft separation from the carrier rocket occurring at 23:49:03. 

The mission, which marked the 13 orbital launch of 2008, is the 25 commercial launch to be conducted by the international Sea Launch consortium, the first of which also lofted a DirecTV satellite. This is also the 250 flight of the &lt;a href="w%3ABlock%20DM"&gt;Block DM&lt;/a&gt; upper stage, which is used on some variants of the Zenit and &lt;a href="w%3AProton%20rocket"&gt;Proton rocket&lt;/a&gt;s. Launch had been delayed from November 2007 due to damage to the launch platform caused by the failure of an earlier Zenit launch. Delays from earlier this month were caused by a problem with the satellite, resulting in a ten-day delay, and a further two-day delay from Monday evening due to an undisclosed problem with the rocket.

DirecTV-11 is a &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20702"&gt;Boeing 702&lt;/a&gt; satellite, which will provide Direct-to-home &lt;a href="w%3AHigh-definition"&gt;High-definition&lt;/a&gt; television broadcasting services to houses in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, by means of &lt;a href="w%3AKa-band"&gt;Ka-band&lt;/a&gt; communications. It is one of three such satellites operated by DirecTV. The satellite made its first contact with the ground several hours after launch, at 05:44 GMT.

The launch was dedicated to &lt;a href="w%3AArthur%20C.%20Clarke"&gt;Arthur C. Clarke&lt;/a&gt; who &lt;a href="Visionary%20and%20author%20Arthur%20C.%20Clarke%20dead%20at%20age%2090"&gt;died on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. Clarke, who was most well known for writing the book which ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3A2001%3A%20A%20Space%20Odyssey"&gt;2001: A Space Odyssey&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ was based on, was also the first person to suggest placing satellites into &lt;a href="w%3AGeosynchronous%20orbit"&gt;geosynchronous&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Ageostationary%20orbit"&gt;geostationary orbit&lt;/a&gt;s. DirecTV-11 will be placed into such an orbit.

Sea Launch President Rob Peckham said that he "feels good" about the mission success, and that Sea Launch was "proud of [its] role in DirecTV's continued success". Steve O'Neill, the President of Boeing Satellite Systems, said that the launch was "a great ride", and thanked Sea Launch for their "excellent work".

The satellite's initial orbit was confirmed to be 250km x 36484.8km x 0&amp;deg;, differing by only 2.8km from the planned orbit.

Sea Launch have a further four launches planned for this year. In addition, its subsidiary &lt;a href="w%3ALand%20Launch"&gt;Land Launch&lt;/a&gt; will conduct its first launch, using a &lt;a href="w%3AZenit%20rocket"&gt;Zenit-3SLB&lt;/a&gt; rocket from area 45/1 at the &lt;a href="w%3ABaikonur%20Cosmodrome"&gt;Baikonur Cosmodrome&lt;/a&gt; to launch the &lt;a href="w%3AAMOS-60"&gt;AMOS-60&lt;/a&gt; satellite. This is currently scheduled for mid-April. The next Sea Launch mission, with the Galaxy 18 satellite, is scheduled for May.

In it, bin Laden warns that the recent republication of the controversial &lt;a href="w%3AJyllands-Posten%20Muhammad%20cartoons%20controversy"&gt;Muhammad cartoons&lt;/a&gt; is more offensive than the killing of women and children and says that a "reckoning for it will be more severe."

"If there is no check in the freedom of your words, then let your hearts be open to the freedom of our actions," bin Laden said. In the audio, he sought to reason with the "intelligent ones" in the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;.

In 2005, the &lt;a href="Denmark"&gt;Danish&lt;/a&gt; newspaper ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AJyllands-Posten"&gt;Jyllands-Posten&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ published a series of cartoons, most of which depicted the &lt;a href="Islam"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;ic prophet &lt;a href="w%3AMuhammad"&gt;Muhammad&lt;/a&gt;. This eventually touched off a series of international protests and boycotts.

In February, tensions flared up again after Danish police arrested three men in an alleged plot to murder cartoonist &lt;a href="w%3AKurt%20Westergaard"&gt;Kurt Westergaard&lt;/a&gt;. Newspapers in Denmark and elsewhere in the EU republished the cartoons in a display of free speech. This was met by protests and boycotts in Muslim nations.

A &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; report released Thursday states that recent attacks carried out on four villages in &lt;a href="Darfur"&gt;Darfur&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href="Sudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt;ese military and armed miltias were a violation of international law.

The attacks, which involved aerial bombardment in two of the villages, left a total of 115 people dead and over 30,000 forcibly displaced, according to the report. Damage to civilian property was extensive; homes, schools, and shops were systematically destroyed, vandalized, or set ablaze, food reserves were burned, and livestock was looted. In addition, there were several reports of rape in one village.

The report, issued jointly by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and the UN African Union Mission in Darfur, describes attacks on the &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Darfur"&gt;West Darfur&lt;/a&gt; villages of Saraf Jidad, Sirba, Silea and Abu Suruj in January and February. The attacks were part of a Sudanese military campaign to regain control of West Darfur's northern corridor and drive out rebel insurgents from the &lt;a href="w%3AJustice%20and%20Equality%20Movement"&gt;Justice and Equality Movement&lt;/a&gt; (JEM).

The damage to civilians was deemed to be a "deliberate and integral part" of the military strategy. In failing to "distinguish between civilian objects and military objectives", the UN accused the Sudanese military of violating international humanitarian law. The activities of the JEM were also denounced, as they were found to be in violation of the &lt;a href="w%3AApril%208%20Humanitarian%20Ceasefire%20Agreement"&gt;2004 N'Djamena Ceasefire Agreement&lt;/a&gt;.

In Saraf Jidad, which was attacked three times in January, 26 civilians were killed, and almost the entire population was displaced. Witnesses described the attackers as &lt;a href="w%3AArab"&gt;Arab&lt;/a&gt; men called &lt;a href="w%3AJanjaweed"&gt;Janjaweed&lt;/a&gt;, who have had the assistance of the Sudanese government. The men were seen riding horses and camels, and some were in military vehicles. After exchanging fire with the JEM, they entered the town, where they started torching homes and shooting at civilians. 
One of the victims from Saraf Jidad, who was around 80 years old, recalled the January 24 attack. "The attackers entered my house," he said. "They were four, in military uniforms. One of them hit my head with the butt of his gun. I fell down. He told me, ‘If you do not all move from here we will burn you alive.' At that, they set my house on fire. I was inside, but managed to escape though I had my arms injured by the fire."

In the other three villages, witnesses reported seeing &lt;a href="w%3AAntonov"&gt;Antonov&lt;/a&gt; planes and military helicopters along with the armed militiamen and Sudanese troops. In Silea, the ground offensive was preceded by three aerial bombardments in different areas of the town. Nearly the entire population of 10,600 was displaced, with some having to go across the border to &lt;a href="Chad"&gt;Chad&lt;/a&gt;. 

One witness of the Silea attack reported, "An Antonov flew into the area and dropped three bombs ... I saw many houses set ablaze by the bombing. People started running randomly in fear and confusion. I witnessed SAF and Janjaweed looting houses, shops and NGO offices. They would load the stolen goods in their cars and on their camels and horses and take them away." 

The village of Abu Suruj was also bombed, but no casualties were reported from this bombing. However, over 75 percent of the town was burnt down by ground troops, and 30 people were killed.

In Sirba, the pattern of attack was similar to that of Abu Suruj. Half of the village was burned down and 45 people were killed. One victim described an encounter with an armed man: "I was holding tight my four-year-old brother; I was scared that the man was going to shoot him. Instead he left. After a few seconds the roof of the house was burning. He saw we were inside and he set the hut on fire to burn us alive. We escaped from the window and ran in different directions."

Witnesses reported acts of sexual violence being committed by the attackers in Sirba, and UN investigators believe at least 10 women were victims of rape. An eyewitness reported four girls being taken into a hut and raped at gunpoint by Sudanese soldiers.

There were also reports of air and ground attacks in Jebel Moon, where many victims had fled following the attacks, but the UN was denied access to the area.

On March 3, the UN met with a West Darfur security official to address their concerns. The official argued that the JEM had taken control of the villages and a deployment of troops was necessary to regain these areas. He also denied that the Sudanese military was involved in the Saraf Jidad attacks, stating they were done by Arab tribes who had nothing to do with the military campaign.

&lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Ranger"&gt;Paul Ranger&lt;/a&gt; left the game after taking a hit into the boards. He did not return, and appeared to be favoring his left arm or shoulder. Ranger had a pair of assists before leaving the game in the third period.

<h3>Columbus Blue Jackets @ Detroit Red Wings</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3AManny%20Malhotra"&gt;Manny Malhotra&lt;/a&gt; broke a scoreless tie for Columbus 7:05 into the second period.

<h3>Washington Capitals @ Chicago Blackhawks</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3AJason%20Williams"&gt;Jason Williams&lt;/a&gt; scored first 1:27 into the first period. &lt;a href="w%3AJonathan%20Toews"&gt;Jonathan Toews&lt;/a&gt;'s power play goal put the Blackhawks ahead by 2 3:19 into the first. &lt;a href="w%3AYanic%20Perreault"&gt;Yanic Perreault&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Sharp"&gt;Patrick Sharp&lt;/a&gt; each also scored in the opening period, giving Chicago a 4 goal lead going into the first intermission. &lt;a href="w%3ARene%20Bourque"&gt;Rene Bourque&lt;/a&gt; scored just over halfway through the second period, putting Chicago ahead by 5.
<h3>Anaheim Ducks @ Dallas Stars</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3ABrenden%20Morrow"&gt;Brenden Morrow&lt;/a&gt; scored a shorthanded goal over halfway through the first period, giving Dallas their only lead of the game. The Ducks struck back when &lt;a href="w%3AScott%20Niedermayer"&gt;Scott Niedermayer&lt;/a&gt; scored his 7th of the season to tie the score at 1 goal apiece. &lt;a href="w%3ATodd%20Bertuzzi"&gt;Todd Bertuzzi&lt;/a&gt; scored the game winner, a go-ahead goal with 28 seconds left in regulation, which gave the Ducks the win.
<h3>Minnesota Wild @ San Jose Sharks</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3AJeremy%20Roenick"&gt;Jeremy Roenick&lt;/a&gt; scored his 12th of the season late in the first period, which put the Sharks on the board and in the lead. Minnesota answered back 49 seconds into the second, when &lt;a href="w%3AStephane%20Veilleux"&gt;Stephane Veilleux&lt;/a&gt; put a puck past &lt;a href="w%3AEvgeni%20Nabokov"&gt;Evgeni Nabokov&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3ACurtis%20Brown"&gt;Curtis Brown&lt;/a&gt; put the Sharks back in the lead a few minutes later. &lt;a href="w%3AMarian%20Gaborik"&gt;Marian Gaborik&lt;/a&gt; scored a power play goal early in the third, tying the score. &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Pavelski"&gt;Joe Pavelski&lt;/a&gt; scored to put San Jose ahead with 2:02 left in regulation. Minnesota was able to re-tie the score when Gaborik scored his second of the night with just 29 seconds left in regulation to force overtime and eventually a shootout. Pavelski and &lt;a href="w%3ABrent%20Burns"&gt;Brent Burns&lt;/a&gt; each scored for their respective teams, which tied the shootout in the first round. Roenick scored the deciding shootout goal in the third round, which gave the Sharks their 13th win in 14 games.

&lt;a href="w%3AKurtis%20Foster"&gt;Kurtis Foster&lt;/a&gt; was taken off the ice in a stretcher in the second period, after being pushed from behind, losing his balance, and crashing into the boards during a race for the puck in a touch-icing situation. Foster has surgery Thursday to repair damage to a broken leg, and will miss the rest of the 2007-08 season, including the playoffs.

According to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Geological%20Survey"&gt;United States Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt; (USGS) an &lt;a href="w%3Aearthquake"&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt; with a preliminary &lt;a href="w%3AMoment%20Magnitude%20Scale"&gt;magnitude&lt;/a&gt; 7.2 has struck the &lt;a href="w%3AXinjiang"&gt;Xinjiang&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;. The Earthquake Administration of China has reported the quake to be a 7.3 magnitude.

The quake struck at 6:33 a.m. (local time) and its &lt;a href="w%3Aepicenter"&gt;epicenter&lt;/a&gt; was located 228 kilometers (142 miles) southeast of &lt;a href="w%3AHotan"&gt;Hotan&lt;/a&gt; and 780 k.m. (485 miles) east, northeast of &lt;a href="w%3AIslamabad%2C%20Pakistan"&gt;Islamabad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;. The depth was recorded at 37.2 k.m. (23.1 miles).

According to USGS &lt;a href="w%3AGeophysics"&gt;geophysicist&lt;/a&gt; Dale Grant, this is the largest quake on record to hit the region. The largest quake on record occurred in &lt;a href="w%3A1556%20Shaanxi%20earthquake"&gt;China in 1556&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AShaanxi"&gt;Shaanxi&lt;/a&gt; and had a magnitude of at least 8.0, killing over 830,000 people.

&lt;a href="w%3AAftershock"&gt;Aftershocks&lt;/a&gt; with magnitudes of 5.5 and under began to occur just over an hour later in the same region.

As of 2006, the reported population of Hotan was 114,000. The region is sparsely populated and so far there are reports of only some damage, but no injuries or deaths. However, the USGS states that damage could be "moderate to heavy." The quake struck near the &lt;a href="w%3ATarim%20Basin"&gt;Tarim Basin&lt;/a&gt; which is home to about 1/3 of China's oil reserve supply.

<h1>Senator Obama's passport records breached in January 2008</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Senator%20Obama%27s%20passport%20records%20breached%20in%20January%202008&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Two low-level &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20State"&gt;Department of State&lt;/a&gt; employees have been dismissed and a third employee disciplined over accessing the passport files of Senator &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; "without a need to do so."

According to &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Assistant%20Secretary%20of%20State"&gt;Assistant Secretary of State&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASean%20McCormack"&gt;Sean McCormack&lt;/a&gt;, on three separate incidents which occurred separately on January 9, February 21 and March 14, contract employees of the department's Bureau of Consular Affairs tasked with data entry accessed Obama's file. The breach seems like "imprudent curiosity" among the contract workers, and that senior management at the State Department was not aware of the incidents until Thursday afternoon 

"A monitoring system was tripped when an employee accessed the records of a high-profile individual, When the monitoring system is tripped, we immediately seek an explanation for the records access. If the explanation is not satisfactory, the supervisor is notified." 

Obama's campaign is asking for a complete investigation to find out who looked at Obama's passport file and why, and why the State Department did not reveal details of the security breach until now.

"This is an outrageous breach of security and privacy, even from an administration that has shown little regard for either over the last eight years. Our government's duty is to protect the private information of the American people, not use it for political purposes. This is a serious matter that merits a complete investigation, and we demand to know who looked at Senator Obama's passport file, for what purpose, and why it took so long for them to reveal this security breach," said Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton in a statement to the media.

A similar data breach took place in 1992 when State Department officials looked up data on presidential candidate &lt;a href="Bill%20Clinton"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, in an attempt to find out information from the late 1960s, amid unfounded political campaign rumors that Mr. Clinton had sought to renounce his citizenship to dodge the draft during the Vietnam War while a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford.

That incident triggered a three-year investigation by a special prosecutor, who found that no laws were violated but officials exercised poor judgment. The 1992 search of Mr. Clinton's passport records was part of an effort to speed up Freedom of Information Act requests.

On March 18, President Kevin Baugh of the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20of%20Molossia"&gt;Republic of Molossia&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3Amicronations"&gt;micronation&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href="w%3ANevada"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt;, announced that his country would hold its first ever international summit this June.

&lt;a href="w%3AGrand%20Prince"&gt;Grand Prince&lt;/a&gt; Christopher I and &lt;a href="w%3APrincess"&gt;Princess&lt;/a&gt; Erin of the Principality of Vikesland, another micronation located in &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, will be attending.

Besides the meeting itself, which is scheduled to take place in Molossia's capital city, Espera, President Baugh is to give them a tour of his country as well as the surrounding areas. He is looking forward to the event and hopes that it may "open the way to future visits between Molossia and the other small nations of the world."

The Republic of Molossia and Principality of Vikesland are not recognized by any major countries or international organizations. However, both are by other micronations.

Earlier this month, ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ held an interview with President Baugh.

<h1>Social networking site lets users run virtual campaign for US president</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Social%20networking%20site%20lets%20users%20run%20virtual%20campaign%20for%20US%20president&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
Each day, in living rooms, bars, and message boards across the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, debates rage and opinions flare over the upcoming &lt;a href="2008%20United%20States%20presidential%20election"&gt;presidential election&lt;/a&gt;: "Which candidate has the most experience?" "Which candidate will best be able to unite Americans?" "Which candidate will work to bring about real change in &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;?" Time and again, these questions have been asked and answered by television pundits; they have been analysed in editorials, written about in blogs, and tackled in speeches by the candidates themselves.

But in one corner of the Internet, another oft-ignored, yet equally-important issue is being raised: vegetables.

"I eat them, knowing full well they have no nutrional ♡❤[sic]♡❤ value and cannot be fully digested by the human digestive system. But its fun once in awhile ♡❤[sic]♡❤ to see what you had for dinner last night, the following morning. Why I put this in here...I don't know. Nutrition is important, but humans are basically more inclined to eat meat." This is one of the many platform issues of Jack the Wiz, an Independent candidate for President of the United States.

The Wiz is not really running for President. But he is one of the top-rated Presidential candidates on U4Prez.com, a website that allows users to run a virtual campaign, complete with supporters, press releases, and caucuses, which are lively discussions on serious political issues. They can even compare their rating with the likes of &lt;a href="John%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Hillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt;, all of whom have profiles set up. One blogger described it as "the &lt;a href="w%3AMySpace"&gt;MySpace&lt;/a&gt; of politics".

Candidates create a profile, where they outline their platform and expound their views on subjects ranging from &lt;a href="w%3Aglobal%20warming"&gt;global warming&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aimmigration"&gt;immigration&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3Areligion"&gt;religion&lt;/a&gt; and conspiracy theories. Just like in other &lt;a href="w%3Asocial%20networking%20sites"&gt;social networking sites&lt;/a&gt;, candidates can leave comments on others' profiles; they can also rate other candidates on a scale of 1 to 10 and become a supporter of another campaign. All of this is factored into a candidate's rating, which ultimately determines who will become the next virtual President of the United States.

Eric Gurr, creator of U4Prez.com, says you shouldn't be fooled be the site's MySpace-like facade. "It's all about the politics," he says. "I think most of our users have accounts on MySpace and &lt;a href="w%3AFacebook"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, and use U4prez strictly for the political dialogue." ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ conducted an email interview with Gurr, in which he discussed how the site works, how the Internet has affected politics, and who he is endorsing for President.

<h2>Interview</h2>
♡❤♡What compelled you to create U4Prez.com?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Eric Gurr: ♡❤♡I was having a discussion with a business co-hort and I had suggested that the average Joe was probably better able to be president of the United States than many of the politicians considering running. This was back in 2006. I had at about this same time read the book &lt;a href="w%3AWikinomics"&gt;Wikinomics&lt;/a&gt;. My first inclination was to create a wiki, on how to solve political problems. But the social networking side was a more natural fit.

♡❤♡Have you had any prior experience in politics or political studies?♡❤♡

♡❤♡EG: ♡❤♡No I really haven't. I've never run for office, and never really been a part of a campaign. I read quite a bit and I'm a bit of a polymath when it comes to history and economics. When I read a book like &lt;a href="w%3AFreedom%20from%20Fear"&gt;Freedom from Fear&lt;/a&gt;, or Modern Times by &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Johnson%20%28writer%29"&gt;Paul Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, I check the footnotes. When I read an article on-line, for some reason I have an inclination to check up on the author to see if his facts are right.
♡❤♡What goes on in a typical U4Prez candidate’s campaign?♡❤♡

♡❤♡EG: ♡❤♡We have three distinct profiles. The quick drive by profile with little information, the interested candidate who probably posts once or twice a week, and the die-hards. The die hards of course drive the site. These candidates are passionate and amazingly well informed. 

♡❤♡What measures are taken to stop trolling and prevent heated debates from becoming too heated?♡❤♡

♡❤♡EG: ♡❤♡In the first couple of months we had to moderate the site twenty four hours a day. As the election has heated up this has oddly become less of a concern. We never censor political thought, but we do put dirty word filters in place. The dialogue gets heated, but almost never crosses the line. I've been contacted by &lt;a href="w%3AABC%20News"&gt;ABC News&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Aslate.com"&gt;slate.com&lt;/a&gt; and quite a few other news outlets and their first impression is that this is just a bunch of college kids arguing about things they don't understand. The reality is quite different. The debate is structured in caucuses, and we occasionally hold moderated debates between specific candidates. The average age of the candidates is about 35, so this is a much more serious crowd than you would suppose.

♡❤♡How is a candidate’s rating calculated? What specific factors are taken into account?♡❤♡

♡❤♡EG: ♡❤♡Candidates must campaign. The core score is ratings by other candidates on a scale of 1 to 10. But this is only about 70% of total score. After six months of use, we developed a voting algorithm based on how members were using the site. You could literally have a perfect score of ten from members, and never get in to a runoff. You have to debate the issues, you have to visit and vote on other candidates platforms. In other words, you need to campaign. This boosts your candidate rank and overall score.

♡❤♡Were any of the real-life candidates’ profiles created by the candidates themselves?♡❤♡

♡❤♡EG: ♡❤♡Not to my knowledge. I have seen in the log files that many of the candidates' campaigns have visited the site. Many of the profiles from the real-life candidates were created by us early in the process. We simply pulled the information from their official sites. That said, many of the third party or independent candidate profiles are created by the candidates themselves, or their staffs.

♡❤♡Many of the top-rated candidates on your site are independent or third party candidates. Why is this the case online but not in real life?♡❤♡

♡❤♡EG: ♡❤♡It has to do with viability. We took a survey several months ago and found that many of the candidates who were professed third party supporters intended to vote for either a Democrat or Republican in the real election.
♡❤♡Do you think most users take the site’s political aspects seriously, or are they more interested in the social networking aspect?♡❤♡

♡❤♡EG: ♡❤♡It's all about the politics. I think most of our users have accounts on MySpace and Facebook, and use U4prez strictly for the political dialogue. 

♡❤♡In your opinion, has the internet has significantly affected the way presidential elections unfold?♡❤♡

♡❤♡EG: ♡❤♡Absolutely. The support and money raised by &lt;a href="Ron%20Paul"&gt;Ron Paul&lt;/a&gt; ultimately led to the nomination of John McCain. The more traditionally conservative candidates lost millions to Paul. This was entirely an internet phenomenon. Because of the communication capabilities of the web, people who have a strong interest in politics naturally migrate to the web. At u4prez for example, our members aren't likely voters, they are voters. This is true for just about any politically oriented site. Some of the candidates are picking up on this and using the web to deliver truly custom messages directly to real voters.

♡❤♡How do you think the internet will affect politics in the 2012 election and beyond?♡❤♡

♡❤♡EG: ♡❤♡The influence of certain websites will grow exponentially. The big question is what will the impact of the bloggers become? We are rolling out a new feature on the site in the next couple of weeks to allow our members to rate political blogs. As of now, there is no clearinghouse for political blogs. We are going to fill a big gap with this feature. The print media decline will continue and probably accelerate. To help this process along we as members of the web community need a way to vet new content and content creators.&lt;br&gt;
♡❤♡Is there any political issue that you feel has been overlooked by the media?♡❤♡

♡❤♡EG: ♡❤♡The &lt;a href="w%3Ababy%20boomer"&gt;baby-boomers&lt;/a&gt;. In January of 2008 the first baby-boomer became eligible for social security. In the next twenty years about 80 million more will follow. Extrapolating the math is pretty easy. In about fifteen short years the entire budget (as it stands now) will need to go to &lt;a href="w%3Asocial%20security%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;social security&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMedicare"&gt;Medicare&lt;/a&gt; and the prescription drug benefit. This of course isn't going to happen. This is a huge issue because 80 million people are going to be voting to protect those programs.&lt;br&gt;
♡❤♡Lastly, who are you endorsing for president and why? ♡❤♡

♡❤♡EG: ♡❤♡As a website, U4prez endorsed Ron Paul. This came from the members of the site. Personally, it's hard for me to visualize anyone running right now who has the vision and can put the problems facing the economy in to any kind of historical context. I can tell you this. There are five thousand members on U4prez, and just a handful of them fully support any of the current candidates. I'm starting to get a pretty strong indication that someone is going to make a real third party run. The Democrats are going to come out of their convention divided that much is now obvious. But the media have overlooked the division within the Republican party over John McCain. &lt;a href="w%3ARoss%20Perot"&gt;Ross Perot&lt;/a&gt; made a huge impact on the election in 1992, and there was relative calm in the nation. 2008 may really be the year a third party candidate emerges at the last minute and wins the election. It's not likely, but neither is it a long-shot.

Another population of small humans has been , this time in caves in Micronesia. 
Lee Berger, Steven Churchill, Bonita De Klerk and Rhonda Quinn, a team of paleontologists and anthropologists from South Africa and the United States document a group of "small-bodied humans" found in the " in limestone caves in the rock islands of &lt;a href="w%3APalau"&gt;Palau&lt;/a&gt;, Micronesia." The report, in a recent edition of the open access journal, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.plosone.org/home.action"&gt;PLoS ONE&lt;/a&gt; (2008 3:3) argues that these small people may "represent a congenitally abnormal individual drawn from a small-bodied island population of Homo Sapiens." The term for this condition is &lt;a href="w%3AInsular%20dwarfism"&gt;Insular Dwarfism&lt;/a&gt; described in &lt;a href="w%3AFoster%27s%20rule"&gt;Foster's Rule&lt;/a&gt;. Different radio carbon samples at the site date between 3000 and 4500 calendar years before the present, with the 3000 year old dates being judged the most reliable.

The authors argue, "Based on the evidence from Palau, we [Berger et al] hypothesize that reduction in the size of the face and chin, large dental size and other features noted here may in some cases be correlates of extreme body size reduction in H. sapiens."

Unlike the 2004 find of the Flores dwarf human population (dated from 95,000 to 13,000 years ago), known as Homo floresienses and nicknamed hobbits, researchers do not consider this population to be a separate hominid population. They also suggest that this more recent population casts some doubt on H. floresienses being a separate species, and that,

"These features when seen in Flores may be best explained as correlates of small body size in an island adaptation, regardless of taxonomic affinity...[This] Palauan sample supports at least the possibility that the Flores hominins are simply an island adapted population of H. sapiens, perhaps with some individuals expressing congenital abnormalities."

In support of this, Berger et al also argued that although the dwarf humans appeared to have many features in commons with &lt;a href="w%3AHomo%20sapiens"&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/a&gt;, there seems to be many features that are not usually associated with Homo sapiens.

A &lt;a href="w%3ASukhoi"&gt;Sukhoi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASu-25"&gt;Su-25&lt;/a&gt; military jet has exploded in midair near &lt;a href="w%3AVladivostok"&gt;Vladivostok&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, killing the pilot. The said the plane was 140km (90 miles) from the port city on the &lt;a href="w%3APacific"&gt;Pacific&lt;/a&gt; coast.

The plane, a single seat twinjet used to support ground forces, was on a training mission when the explosion occurred. Russia has grounded all their Su-25s while the crash is investigated by order of the air force's commander. The investigation will be conducted by a special commission of the Ministry of Defence.

Colonel Alexander Drobyshevsky, spokesman for the Air Force, said "Today, on March 20 at 3:33 Moscow time (0:33 GMT), a Su-25 aircraft crashed during a training flight near the &lt;a href="w%3AChernigovka"&gt;Chernigovka&lt;/a&gt; airbase, 143 kilometers from Vladivostok." The crash site is in mountainous terain, and the Far Eastern Union of Air Force and Air Defense's investigational commission has flown in and is on-site.

Uncomfirmed reports suggest that immediately prior to the crash the pilot reported an engine fire, followed by a loss of contact. ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AInterfax"&gt;Interfax&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reports that an anonymous source involved with the investigation said "The head of flight control reported that he saw a flash under the fuselage of the strike plane. More than likely one of the weapons exploded."

Drobyshevsky offered an alternative explanation. "According to preliminary reports, the plane developed technical problems during live firing exercises," he said.

Just hours after firing two contract employees and disciplining a third for inappropriately examining the passport file of Democratic presidential candidate Sen. &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State"&gt;Secretary of State&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Condoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; told Sen. &lt;a href="Hillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt; that her passport file was also breached in 2007. Sen. &lt;a href="John%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt;, the Republican candidate for president, also had his file breached — this time by one of the same individuals who had examined Obama's records.

Both Clinton and McCain were informed that their files were improperly accessed, according to their Senate offices, after Rice called to apologize to Barack Obama for the incident hours before.

"I told him I was sorry and I told him that I myself would be very disturbed if anyone had looked at my passport file and that, therefore, I will stay on top of this," Rice said. "We are going to do an investigation through the inspector general. None of us want us to have a situation where any American's passport file is accessed in an unauthorized way."

According to &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Assistant%20Secretary%20of%20State"&gt;Assistant Secretary of State&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASean%20McCormack"&gt;Sean McCormack&lt;/a&gt;, at least one breach occurred during a training session, with a contract employee brought in to deal with a large backlog of passport applications.

"We do feel that the system worked, but the system isn’t perfect," McCormack said.

Obama's response to the incident was "One of the things that the American people count on in their interactions with any level of government is that if they have to disclose personal information, then it is going to stay personal and stay private." He also told reporters he expects a full and thorough congressional investigation.

McCain, who was in France after recently traveling to Iraq responded to the incident stating, "The United States of America values everyone's privacy and corrective action should be taken."

&lt;a href="NASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ACassini%E2%80%93Huygens"&gt;Cassini&lt;/a&gt; spacecraft has discovered evidence that points to the existence of an underground ocean of water and ammonia on &lt;a href="w%3ASaturn"&gt;Saturn&lt;/a&gt;'s moon &lt;a href="w%3ATitan"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;.

"We believe that about 100 kilometers (62 miles) beneath the ice and organic-rich surface is an internal ocean of liquid water mixed with ammonia," said Bryan Stiles of NASA's &lt;a href="w%3AJet%20Propulsion%20Laboratory"&gt;Jet Propulsion Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3APasadena%2C%20California"&gt;Pasadena&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;.

If the findings turn out to be true, this will be the fourth such moon in our solar system found to have some form of water on it. Currently only three other moons, all from &lt;a href="w%3AJupiter%20%28planet%29"&gt;Jupiter&lt;/a&gt;, have been found to have known water sources. &lt;a href="w%3AGanymede%20%28moon%29"&gt;Ganymede&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACallisto%20%28moon%29"&gt;Callisto&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AEuropa%20%28moon%29"&gt;Europa&lt;/a&gt; are so far the only known moons with a water source.

Members of the mission's science team used Cassini's Synthetic Aperture Radar to collect imaging data during 19 separate passes over Titan between October 2005 and May 2007. The radar can see through Titan's dense, methane-rich atmospheric haze, detailing never-before-seen surface features and establishing their locations on the moon's surface.

Using data from the radar's early observations, the scientists and radar engineers established the locations of 50 unique landmarks on Titan's surface. They then searched for these same lakes, canyons and mountains in the reams of data returned by Cassini in its later flybys of Titan. They found prominent surface features had shifted from their expected positions by up to 30 kilometers (19 miles). A systematic displacement of surface features would be difficult to explain unless the moon's icy crust was decoupled from its core by an internal ocean, making it easier for the crust to move.

Cassini scientists will not have long to wait before another go at Titan. On March 25, just prior to its closest approach at an altitude of 1,000 kilometers (620 miles), Cassini will employ its Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer to examine Titan's upper atmosphere. Immediately after closest approach, the spacecraft's Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer will capture high-resolution images of Titan's southeast quadrant. 

The study of Titan is a major goal of the Cassini-Huygens mission because it may preserve, in deep-freeze, many of the chemical compounds that preceded life on &lt;a href="w%3AEarth"&gt;Earth&lt;/a&gt;. Titan is the only moon in the solar system that possesses a dense atmosphere. The moon's atmosphere is 1.5 times denser than Earth's. Titan is the largest of Saturn's moons, bigger than the planet &lt;a href="w%3AMercury%20%28planet%29"&gt;Mercury&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>Red Bull Racing F1 team must prove safety after David Coulthard suffers crash</h1>

The &lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Bull%20Racing"&gt;Red Bull Racing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFormula%20One"&gt;Formula One&lt;/a&gt; racing team must prove to the &lt;a href="w%3AMalaysian%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;Malaysian Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt; stewards that one of their cars is safe to race after &lt;a href="Scotland"&gt;Scottish&lt;/a&gt; driver &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Coulthard"&gt;David Coulthard&lt;/a&gt; suffered a crash at Friday's opening practice. It was his second major suspension failure in as many weekends and his third major accident, having had his last race ended prematurely after a collision with &lt;a href="w%3AFelipe%20Massa"&gt;Felipe Massa&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AFerrari"&gt;Ferrari&lt;/a&gt;.

A part failure caused Coulthard to run off the road. When he subsequently hit a kerb both sides of the front suspension completely failed, ripping both wheels loose. He was unable to participate in any more pre-race practice.

After stewards met team head Christian Horner and technical head Adrian Newey a statement was released stating that the technical delegate required to receive a detailed technical report from Red Bull. The purpose of this would be to prove that the vehicle is race worthy as determined by an article in the technical regulations. This article gives stewards the powers to prevent cars from competing if they are deemed to be unsafe.

"The Stewards, having met with the Team Principal and Technical Representative of Red Bull Racing in relation to the incident involving Car 9 in Practice 1, have requested that the competitor provide to the FIA Technical Delegate a report verifying that the integrity of the suspension is such that the car should not be deemed 'of dangerous constructions' under Art 2.3 of the 2008 Formula One Technical Regulations," read the statement.

Howard told reporters he believed there would be no problems with clearing the vehicle for tomorrows race. The failed component, he said, had been fitted immediately after the race at &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;. "It was a front right track rod that failed. You can see that the adhesives failed and it just looked like a human error. So we have absolutely no concerns about the car's safety for tomorrow."

Coulthard was also confident. I am not worried about my safety. Mechanical failures are part and parcel of grand prix racing unfortunately... We did 10,000 kilometres in testing in the car. It was just a new part which did just six laps. It was a fault in the manufacturing process and game over. One jumbo falls out of the sky you don't ground them. All history shows that things fail now and again. With the front suspension the car rides up."

The device was placed by the Basque terrorist group &lt;a href="ETA"&gt;ETA&lt;/a&gt;. A warning was given in the form of a phone call to the DYA road assistance association in Vizcaya in the name of ETA half an hour before it went off. The bomb was placed in a blue Honda Civic which was blown across the street by the force of the explosion. The owners of the vehicle where found later this afternoon, tied up in a building in a mountainous region some 100kms away. They have told the police that their car was taken from at gunpoint during the morning.

The place where the bomb exploded is a busy one, not least because one of Spain's famous Holy Week processions had only just finished. The same barracks suffered another ETA attack, again without victims, back in 1983. The Civil Guard feared that a second device may have been placed in the same area today.

A demonstration against the outrage has been called for outside the Calahorra Town Hall at 8pm tonight. The President of the La Rioja regional government, Pedro Sanz, will visit the scene and take part in the demonstration. He said that a massacre could have taken place had the area not been cleared.

Today’s attack comes just two weeks after the last ETA victim, the ex Socialist councillor, Isaías Carrasco, was shot out his home in Mondragón.

According to police investigating the death of a 2-year old boy in &lt;a href="w%3AHidalgo%20County%2C%20Texas"&gt;Hidalgo County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, the boy's death may have been caused by a morbidly obese relative who fell on him, fracturing his skull.

"It didn't look like there was any foul play," according to &lt;a href="w%3AJustice%20of%20the%20Peace"&gt;Justice of the Peace&lt;/a&gt; Bobby Conteras. The boy was pronounced dead on Tuesday.

The boy was dropped off at the relative's house to spend the day there, according to the boy's mother. County Sheriff Lupe Treviño, who called the death "suspicious," is reported to be waiting for an official cause of death before making a decision to file charges or not.

The identity of the child is not yet known.

Ma represented the &lt;a href="w%3APan-Blue%20Coalition"&gt;Pan-Blue Coalition&lt;/a&gt;, which consists of the &lt;a href="w%3AKuomintang"&gt;Kuomintang&lt;/a&gt;, the People First Party, and the New Party and generally supports maintaining the current status quo. The coalition is in direct opposition to the &lt;a href="w%3APan-Green%20Coalition"&gt;Pan-Green Coalition&lt;/a&gt;, which consists of the &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Progressive%20Party"&gt;Democratic Progressive Party&lt;/a&gt;, the Taiwan Solidarity Union, and the Taiwan Independence Party and generally supports Taiwanese independence. Hsieh, former Premier of the ROC, was the candidate for the Pan-Green Coalition.

Born in Hong Kong, Ma studied at &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20University"&gt;New York University&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AHarvard"&gt;Harvard Law School&lt;/a&gt; and once held an American permanent resident "green card". Hsieh implied during the election that Ma might flee the country during a time of crisis. Hsieh also argued that the photogenic Ma was more style than substance. Despite these accusations, Ma won handily on a platform advocating closer ties with the Chinese mainland.

Ma Ying-jeou will be inaugurated as the new President in May 2008, with Vincent Shew being the new Vice President, replacing the current president &lt;a href="w%3AChen%20Shui-Bian"&gt;Chen Shui-bian&lt;/a&gt; and ending the DPP's 8-year rule of Taiwan. Ma has promised to increase economic ties with Mainland China by increasing tourism, air flights and relaxing rules that govern Taiwanese investments in the mainland. Ma, however, does not argue for political union. He called Chinese Premier Weng Jiabao's recent call for "one China" talks "rude, unreasonable, arrogant, absurd, and self-righteous."

&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;, President of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, has issued a statement congratulating Ma on his success and reasserting that the U.S. will continue to maintain unofficial ties with Taiwan.

Two &lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20of%20China%20United%20Nations%20membership%20referendum%2C%202008"&gt;referendums&lt;/a&gt; regarding Taiwan's involvement in the United Nations and other international organizations were also held along with the presidential election. The ROC Central Election Commission also confirmed that both referendums have failed due to low turnout.
